REPORT 

UPON 

THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM 
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1898. 

BY 

Charles D. Walcott, 

Acting Assisfavt Secretary, Smithsonian Iriatitution, in charge of the U. S. National 

Museum. 

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 

ORGANIZATION.^ 

In the iutroductioii to the Report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 
1897, attention was called to a new plan of organization, which went 
into effect July 1, 1897, and the statement was made that the results 
of its operations would be considered in the Report for 1898. 

The various divisions and sections of Anthropology, Biology, and 
Geology, which had previously been conducted independently of one 
another, the curators and custodians reporting directly to the Assistant 
Secretary in charge of the Museum, were united under three head cura- 
tors, one of anthropology, another of biology, and a third of geology. 
This secured direct expert supervision and properly correlated the 
work of each department. Before, such correlation had been impossi- 
ble, owing to the large number of independent heads of sections and 
divisions in each department, who planned and executed the work more 
or less independently of one another. The official correspondence was 
also more closely centralized in the executive office of the Museum. 

Anthropology. — In the Department of Anthropology a large amount 
of work was done by Mr. W. H. Holmes in reorganizing and installing 
the exhibits, under a general scheme approved early in the year. The 
organization of the department, the personnel, and the details of the 
work will be found in his report. There are a number of sections that 
have not yet been assigned to any division, remaining for the present 
under the direct supervision of the head curator. Moreover, the clas- 
sification of material and the division of work among the various mem- 
bers of the present staff, so far as it has progressed, is largely tentative, 
owing to the staff being composed of specialists in limited portions of 
the field of anthropology; this necessitates a somewhat arbitrary 



The organization of the staff is given in Appendix I. 



4 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

classification and organization. As the various branches of the work 
develop, and increase is made in the number of curators, reclassifica- 
tion of material and readjustment of the force will gradually lead to a 
satisfactory and permanent organization. 

The accessions to the department were numerous and valuable. 
Among those of more notable importance is a collection of antiquities 
and ethnological material, the bequest of the late Mr. W. Hallett 
Phillips, of Washington, to the Smithsonian Institution. This collec- 
tion is not only of great extent, but of exceptional value to archaeolog- 
ical science. It contains 12,407 ancient relics, mainly stone implements 
from the Potomac region, and 106 ethnological specimens from Poly- 
nesia. By transfer from the Bureau of American Ethnology the 
Museum received material from Arizona, Arkansas, and Georgia; and 
by transfer from the Army Medical Museum, a collection of 2,206 
human crania, representing mainly the Indian tribes, ancient and mod- 
ern, of North America. There was received on deposit, and at the 
same time ottered for sale, an extensive collection of stone implements 
and other ancient relics from various parts of Georgia, together with 
a collection of ethnological material from the Indians of the Great 
Plains and the Eocky Mountains, made by Emile Granier, of Paris. 
Valuable deposits were made by Prof. Alexander Graham Bell. These 
include a large number of i)ieces of apparatus made and used by him in 
his experiments and researches in various branches of electrical sci- 
ence. The General Electric Company also deposited many pieces of 
original apparatus connected with the early use of electricity for light- 
ing, the transmission of x>ower, and like purposes. Other valuable 
deposits are described in the report of the head curator. 

During the year there were prepared by the curators and expert 
preparators of the department a number of models illustrating primitive 
life, processes, implements, utensils, etc. 

The research work of the department during the year was extensive, 
the study, comparison, and classification of the collections before instal- 
lation being essential to their intelligent utilization. 

The system of installation inaugurated by Mr. Holmes is somewhat 
elaborate. The primary arrangement is founded, first, on the geo- 
graphical or ethnographical assemblage, and, second, on the develop- 
mental or genetic assemblage. Other methods may be classed as sjiecial. 
They are the chronological, the comi)arative, the individual, etc. The 
primary methods are adapted to the presentation of the general truths 
of anthropology, and the special methods ai^e available for limited por- 
tions of the field. A full description of the method of installation will 
be found in Mr. Holmes's report. 

Biology. — The Department of Biology was embarrassed by reason of 
Dr. True's time being largely consumed in executive work, and it was 
not until late in the year that he secured an assistant curator to take 
charge of the work in the Division of Mammals. 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. O 

111 many ways the Departmeiit of Biology, wbeu establisbed at the 
beginning of the fiscal year, was in much better condition than either 
of the other two departments. The several zoological divisions already 
existing and the Division of Plants were brought together under a 
separate administrative head. As many of these divisions have been 
in existence since the reorganization of the Museum in 1881, and 
several of them for a much longer period, the organization of the 
department was a relatively simi)le matter. The biological specimens 
constitute the larger part of the Museum collections. They had been 
in charge of curators and assistants who followed the well-defined and 
long-established methods of systematic zoology and botany, and there- 
fore no radical changes in the scientific methods or in the business 
administration of these divisions were required. The efiorts of the 
head curator were largely in the direction of developing those features 
which, from various cases, had not had due prominence. He found the 
same difficulties met with by the other head curators in regard to 
laboratory and exhibition space and the force at his command. A large 
amount of the biological mal erial is displayed in the Smithsonian build- 
ing. The bringing together of all the invertebrates in this building 
was accomplished during the year, and this is a great gain in the classi- 
fication of the exhibits. These collections include insects, mollusks, 
and all other classes of invertebrates. The display in Musuem build- 
ing includes the mammals, batrachians, reptiles, fishes, and the collec- 
tions representing comparative anatomy. The birds remain in the 
Smithsonian building, it having been found impracticable to transfer 
this large exhibit to the Museum building. 

The erection of galleries in the Museum building — a subject adverted 
to later — while not involving great changes in this department, as in 
the departments of Anthropology and Geology, rendered necessary the 
complete reinstallation of the large exhibition series of mammals. In 
the reinstallation Dr. True arranged the zoological exhibition on a 
faunal basis, special ijrominence being given to the faunas of the United 
States. This principal series is to be supplemented by various smaller 
series illustrating important topics in biology. 

The additions to the zoological and botanical collections were nu- 
merous, and in some directions unusually important! The generous 
donation of Messrs. Hubbard and Schwarz of their collection of Coleop- 
tera, principally North American, comprising about 200,001) specimens 
and representing approximately 12,000 species, is of great importance, 
as it places the IsTational Museum in advance of all others as regards 
North American Coleoptera. Dr. W. L. Abbott continued his liberal 
gifts to the Museum by presenting large collections of birds, mammals, 
reptiles, insects, and other animals from lower Siam and Kashmir; and 
Dr. W. L. Ralph supplemented his valuable additions to the collections 
of birds' eggs. The largest acquisition to the mollusks consisted in 
the gift by Dr. R. Ellsworth Call of a collection including over 86,000 
specimens. 



6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Great activity prevailed during the year in the Division of Plants. 
Accessions to the number of 307 were made, including the purchase of 
all of the most valuable sets of American plants offered for sale that 
were needed to iill out the Government collections. This division is 
more fortunate than others in the Museum, having funds from which 
such purchases can be made. 

The scientific bureaus of the Government, including the Fish Com- 
mission and the Biological Survey of the Dej^artment of Agriculture, 
continued to make very valuable additions to the national biological 
collections. A full description of tliese, and also of numerous additions 
from individuals, is given in the report of the head curator of the dei)art- 
ment, where also will be found the changes in the personnel and an 
account of the work for the year. 

Geology. — In the Department of Geology Dr. Merrill gave a large por- 
tion of his time during the year to studying various European museums 
for the j)urpose of obtaining information as to the best cases and methods 
of installation of collections in museums. In addition to the head 
curator's absence, nearly all work was suspended in the exhibition halls 
during the construction of the new galleries and exhibition cases, so 
that little progress was made in the exhibition series during the first 
half of the year. Dr. Merrill resumed active charge of the department 
early in November, when he began a systematic examination of the 
written and printed records of the various exploring expeditions and 
surveys, with a view to ascertaining what geological material liad been 
collected which could properly be considered the jjroperty of the Gov- 
ernment, and what disposition had been made of the same. The law 
provides that collections made for the Government shall, when no 
longer needed for investigations in progress, be dej)Osited in the National 
Museum.i It was found that this law had not in all cases been enforced, 
with the result that several important collections had not been trans- 
ferred to the Museum, although several of the earlier exploring expe- 
ditions had passed out of existence, and in several instances the 
individuals making the collections had likewise passed away. It was 
decided to investigate all such cases. A fine collection of fossil fishes, 
made by the Hayden Survey, was obtained from the executors of 
Professor Cope's estate, and some other material is soon to be trans- 
ferred by them. A request was made to the Geological Survey for 
any material that could be transferred without detriment to investiga- 
tions in progress, assurance being given that the Museum could take 
charge of extensive collections. The Survey soon transferred a large 

' "And all collections of rocks, minerals, soils, fossils, and objects of natural his- 
tory, archseology, and ethnology, made by the Coast and Interior Survey, the Geo- 
logical Survey, or by any other parties for the Government of the United States, 
when no longer needed for investigations in progress shall be deposited in the 
National Museum." (Supplement to the Eevised Statutes of the United States, Vol. 
I, second edition, 1874-1891, page 252.)

amount of good material, including in one instance two carloads of 
vertebrate fossils from the laboratories of Prof. O. 0. Marsh, iu New 
Haven, Connecticut. 

The collection of fossil invertebrates was greatly enriched by two 
most important gifts. Through the bequest of the late I. H. Harris, 
of Ohio, the Museum came into jjossession of his private collection of 
over 20,000 specimens of fossils; this is particularly rich iu many rare 
forms and a number of original types. From Mr. E. D. Lacoe, of 
Pittston, Pennsylvania, to whom the Museum was already so largely 
indebted, there was received a large collection of fossil insects, com- 
prising upward of 4,600 specimens, of which more than 200 are types. 
Other valuable accessions are mentioned in the report of the head 
curator. 

In the Division of Mineralogy satisfactory progress was made in the 
installation of the exhibition series. An immense amount of detail 
work in overhauling and classifying collections stored iu boxes and 
drawers was accomplished. Owing to the pressure of other matters 
and the unsatisfactory condition of the exhibition halls, scarcely any 
investigations of note were undertaken by the curators. 

GALLERIES. 

The erection of the galleries in three of the halls and the four courts 
of the Museum building, under the acts of Congress approved June 11, 
189G, and June 4, 1897, was completed during the year, with the excep- 
tion of the permanent railings. This increased the available floor 
space of the Museum 17,000 square feet, or about one-sixth of the former 
exhibition space, The various wall exhibits that formerly extended to 
a greater height than the base of the galleries were removed early in 
the year, and after the galleries were completed many cases containing 
exhibits were placed on them. In addition to the galleries already 
completed, it was decided to construct other galleries affording a fur- 
ther floor space of 6,468 square feet, mainly for the purpose of securing 
more room for the library and for the preparation of exhibits. 

ACCESSIONS. 

During the fiscal year there were 1,441 accessions, containing upward 
of 450,000 specimens, the largest number for any one year during the 
past decade. The total number of specimens recorded to July 1, 1898, 
exceeds 4,000,000. 

ATTENDANCE. 

Owing probably to the national disturbance and distraction caused 
by the war, the attendance was less than during the previous year, 
when the multitude attending the Presidential inauguration ran the 
record unusually high. The following table shows that the number of 
visitors to the Museum since 1881 is 3,972,987.

ADMINISTRATION. 

The administrative work of the Museum was conducted most effi- 
ciently during the year, mainly by Dr. F. W. True, as executive curator, 
and for short intervals by Dr. G. P. Merrill and Mr. W. H. Holmes, 
respectively. Mr. J. L. Willige was acting chief clerk during the absence 
of Mr. Cox in connection with the Nashville and Omaha expositions. 
As chief of buildings and superintendence, Mr. J. E. Watkins took 
charge of the erection of the new galleries, and much of the success 
attending their construction is due to his careful supervision. 

In conclusion, it is a pleasure to me to state that commendation 
is due the head curators and their assistants for the energy and 
patience they have shown and for their willingness to subordinate indi- 
vidual desires and preferences to the general welfare of the work of 
the Museum. It is owing to this esprit de corps that the work of the 
Museum i)rogressed so satisfactorily during the year. 



CONDITIONS AND NEEDS. 

A national museum should be the center of scientific activity in the 
country in which it is located. In England the British Museum is 
the mecca of scientific men. The national museums in Paris, Copen- 
hagen, Vienna, Berlin, and other capitals of Europe stand in similar 
relations to the scientific work of their respective countries. Such a 
relation the National Museum should hold to scientific men and affairs 
in America. It should receive and take care of all classes of mate- 
rial which have been or may be valuable for investigation or for the 
illustration of the ethnology, natural history, geology, products, and 
resources of our own country or for comparison with those of other 
countries. It should furnish material for all kinds of scientific investi- 
gations which deal with specimens or types, and give aid to such 
researches and publish their results. It should present by illustration 
such of the results of the scientific investigations of its corps of officers 
as are susceptible of such representation. It should cooperate with all 
of the higher educational institutions of learning in the country, and 
assist in the promotion and diffusion of knowledge in all of the lines of 
investigation which are carried on by them. It should provide library 
facilities, and, as far as can be done with justice to itself, aid all post- 
graduate students who may wish to take advantage of the generous 
provisions made by the Government for scientific investigations. 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 9 

SPACE. 

The growth of the TJ. S. ]^ational Museum was rapid under the suc- 
cessful charge of tlie Jate Dr. G. Browu Goode. When the character 
of the building and the funds available for its maintenance are consid- 
ered, it compares favorably with any modern museum. It has received 
large collections from the scientilic departments of the Government, and 
through i)rivate contribution (with some additions by purchase and 
exchange), all of which have been accommodated as well as could be in 
the inadequate laboratories, storerooms, and exhibition space. The 
galleries just completed have added 16,000 square feet of floor space, 
which will help to a certain extent to relieve the crowded condition of 
the exhibition halls and courts below. As an illustration of the pres- 
ent conditions and the necessity for more room, attention is called to the 
anthropological collections, which illustrate the development and pro- 
gress of man and his works. If tlie material now in the possession of 
the Government in this department should be properly placed on exhi- 
bition, it would occupy the entire space in the present Museum build- 
ing. The great collections in zoolog}^, botany, economic geology, gen- 
eral geology, and paleontology should be entirely removed and placed 
in a building properly constructed for their study and exhibition. 

Laboratory space. — In the present building there is a great defi- 
ciency in laboratory facilities. Curators and assistants are hampered 
for want of room in which to lay out, arrange, classify, mount, and 
label specimens. There should also be rooms in which students could 
bring together and compare various series of objects, and have at 
hand books and scientific apparatus. The present Museum build- 
ing contains a few rooms suitable for the purposes mentioned, but 
the majority have to be used as storerooms, laboratories, and offices, 
and are therefore too much crowded to serve in any one of these 
capacities. Owing to the pressure ibr space, courts, halls, and gal- 
leries intended for exhibition purposes, both in the Smithsonian 
building and in the Museum building, are unavoidably occupied to a 
considerable extent as laboratories and storerooms. This lack of labo- 
ratory space is extremely detrimental to the interests of the Museum. 

Quarters for storage. — Beyond six small basement rooms under two of 
the corner pavilions the present building has absolutely no provision 
in the way of basement or other rooms for the storage of collections 
which come in from day to day from Government field collectors or 
private donors, or such as are separated for distribution or held for the 
use of students. To remedy this defect many expedients have neces- 
sarily been resorted to, such as placing storage cases (faced with 
mahogany to make them presentable) in the exhibition halls, hiring 
storage rooms in private buildings, and filling up ofiQces, entrances, 
staircase-landings, and passageways not absolutely indispensable. 
The ingenuity which has been exercised in this direction by some of 
the curators is very great and the annoyances that are daily endured 
in the interest of x)reserving the collections deserve notice. What is 



10 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

needed is a series of spacious fireproof basements for the less perish- 
able objects, the collections preserved in alcohol, and the ordinary- 
stores and tools, and equally spacious dry lofts and rooms for those 
collections and stores wliich require protection from dampness. 

ExliibiUon space. — The present Museum building, though large in 
extent, is overcrowded. It was built with the cheapest materials and 
under the cheapest system of construction. Its lack of architectural 
dignity and the indifferent character of the materials of which it is 
constructed give it the appearance of a temporary structure and tend 
to cheapen the eftect of the really good cases and the very valuable 
collections which it contains. The visitor is everywhere confronted 
with rough walls, unfinished ceilings, and obtrusive trusses and sup- 
ports. It should also be remembered that a considerable i^ortion of the 
collections are still in the Smithsonian building, where the crowding 
is scarcely less than in the Museum building. 

INCREASE IN THE SCIENTIFIC STAFF. 

The head curators, curators, assistant curators, and aids, constituting 
the scientific staff of the National Museum, number in all 63 persons, 
divided among sixteen divisions. Of these, 26 are compensated for 
their services and the remainder serve gratuitously, being for the most 
part connected with other bureaus of the Government. The system of 
honorary curatorship, while admirable within restricted limits, is a dis- 
advantage when carried to the present extent. Such a system has a 
disintegrating effect upon the organization, as the men are not entirely 
at the command of the administrative officers and are not obliged to 
serve at definite hours or under the ordinary restrictions of the paid 
curators. The number of honorary oflicers should be reduced by the 
substitution of a larger number of salaried officers. 

The total number of scientific assistants should be very considerably 
increased, as nearly all of the divisions are short-handed and many of 
the collections do not receive the care they should have. At present 
there are not enough assistants who can serve as acting officers in a 
higher grade when the regular occupants of those offices are ill or 
necessarily detailed for service outside of Washington. Moreover, a 
museum can not be successfully carried on with intermittent service, 
and it is extremely desirable that there should always be a consider- 
able number of young men learning the duties of scientific assistants, 
and thus making themselves capable of taking the places of the older 
men when the latter become incapacitated. There are now only four 
or five such young men in the Museum service. 

PUROHASINGr AND COLLECTINO FUND. 

The ISIatioual Museum has at present no regular fund for the acqui- 
sition of collections and special objects, and can only make purchases 
from a contingent fund which rarely exceeds $3,000 or $4,000, and which 
is likely at any time to be required for other necessary expenditures. 
For this reason, every year valuable collections which should be in the 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 11 

bauds of the (Joveriimeut, go abroad or to municipal museums or pass 
iuto the hands of private citizens. Money is also needed to fill out and 
make significant the various series already established in the Museum. 
The American Museum of Natural History in i^ew York expends 
annually $00,000 for the increase of its collections, and the Field 
Columbian Museum in Chicago has spent for collections during the 
last five years over $419,000. Much of this was expended the first 
year, but material is purchased from time to time as it is needed to 
make collections more nearly complete. 

No eftbrt on any scale commensurate with the importance of the 
Museum has hitherto been possible in the direction of acquiring col- 
lections by field work and exploration. There are many kinds of col- 
lections that can be obtained only by scientific men working in the field. 
Collecting expeditions are often costly, but in many cases their results 
are such as can be obtained in no other way. There is no doubt what- 
ever that it would be a very great advantage to the oSlational Museum 
if it could every year, besides purchasing a reasonable amount of mate- 
rial, send out collectors to various regions to obtain objects which are 
never ofl'ered for sale, and which, if gathered by unskilled collectors, 
would lose all their value. 

The experience of many years has shown that however active sur- 
veying and exploring expeditions may be, collections can not thus be 
made to grow symmetrically. There are always gaps which can be 
filled only by purchase of materials. It is often necessary, for jiurposes 
of comparision and for study, that the Museum obtain collections from 
abroad, and such as can be had also only by purchase or exchange. 
This fact is well recognized abroad, and the British museums and some 
of those on the Continent contain rarer and better specimens from 
America than do the American museums. 

DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIMENS. 

It is well known that the Museum distributes great quantities of 
duplicate specimens. This is a very important work and could be much 
extended if tlie scientific staff were larger. The work of bringing 
together, identifying, labeling, and preparing for shipment sets of speci- 
mens for educational institutions is very considerable, and consumes so 
much time that it can not be properly entered upon by the present 
force. 

A NEW MUSEUM BUILDING. 

The immediate and greatest need is a suitable museum building. 
The present building is 375 feet square. The space on the ground 
floor is 140,625 square feet, and that in the galleries 10,000 square feet; 
exhibition space 90,000 square feet. The entire cost was $315,400. 

For comparison with the above figures the following statistics 
relating to the American Museum of Natural History in New York are 
given. Total floor space, 294,000 square feet, divided as follows: Exhi- 
bition space, 196,000 square feet; laboratories, library, etc., 42,500 



12 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



square feet; work rooms, storage, etc., 42,000 square feet; lecture liall, 
13,500 square feet. These figures include the portions of the building 
now being completed. The total cost of the museum to date, including 
the completion of the new wings, is $3,559,470.15. The buildiugs and 
the care of them are provided for by the city of New York. The 
expenses of the scientific staff, increase of collections, etc. (the income 
for which the present year is approximately $185,000), are defrayed 
from endowments, membership fees, and contributions. 

The present National Museum building was erected with the view of 
covering the largest amount of space with the least outlay of money. 
In this respect it may be considered a success. It is, in fact, scarcely 
more than the shadow of such a massive, dignified, and well-finished 
building as should be the home of the great national collections. There 
is needed at once a spacious, absolutely fire-proof building of several 
stories, constructed of durable materials, well lighted, modern in equip- 
ment, and on such a plan that it can be added to as occasion demands 
in the future. A site for such a building is already owned by the Gov- 
ernment; only the building needs to be provided for. What the Capi- 
tol building is to the nation, the Library building to the National 
Library, the Smithsonian building to the Smithsonian Institution, the 
new museum building should be to the National Museum. 

J^xMbition and laboratory space. — If the present building were devoted 
to the Department of Anthropology, in the new building there should 
be provided fully 115,000 square feet of exhibition space for the Depart- 
ment of Biology, and for its laboratory and ofiQce rooms 75,000 square 
feet, making a total of 190,000 square feet. The space mentioned is 
based upon careful estimates of what will be needed for the proper 
housing of and work on the collections now in hand and that will i)rob- 
ably come to the Museum within the present generation. It would be 
provisionally assigned among the different divisions of the department 

as follows :

REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 13 

It is estimated that 05,000 square feet of exhibition space will be 
needed in the Department of Geology and 18,000 square feet for its 
offices and laboratories. 

In addition to the laboratories for biology and geology there should 
also be provided 5,000 square feet of laboratory space for the use of 
post-graduate and special students who come to Washington to avail 
themselves of the exceptional opportunities for study offered by the 
materials brought together in the National Museum and by the inves- 
tigations carried on in the various scientific bureaus. 

There will also be needed a considerable portion of the basement of a 
building for rough storage, preparators' sho^js, taxidermists' rooms, etc. 

Lecture hall. — The need of a suitable lecture hall is imperative. The 
lecture hall of the American Museum of Natural History has 13,500 
square feet of floor space and that of the Field Columbian Museum 
4,250 square feet. A suitable hall for the National Museum should 
include at least 6,000 square feet, and there should also be one or two 
smaller rooms that could be used for lectures on special topics, when a 
small audience only is ex^^ected.

The American Museum of Natural History, which has 294,000 square 
feet of space, has so planned its buildings that additions can be made 
to them as rapidly as funds are available and the increase of the col- 
lections demand the space. Less than one-fourth of the structure as 
originally i3lanned is completed. 

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

With suitable buildings provided, the immediate development of 
the National Museum naturally lies in three directions. First, the 
occupation of the present building by the anthropological collections; 
second, the housing, developing, and installing of the great biological 
collections, and third, the development of a great museum of practical 
geology. 

First. — The collections in anthropology, as they stand to-day, cover 
a wide field in a broken and disconnected way. It is difficult to use 
them effectually to illustrate the great features of this branch of sci- 
ence. They do not present a connected story of the peoples and cul- 
tures of the world. This arises from the gaps in the collections and 
the absence of suitable laboratory and exhibition space. This depart- 



14 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

ment should have .adequate representations of the American peoples 
and their culture, not only of our own country, but of the whole 
American continent. Our nation is the only one in America that can 
reasonably be expected to do anything of importance toward the pres- 
ervation of the materials necessary for the illustration of this vast 
field, and as the American race is a unit, of which the tribes in our 
own territory constitute but a fragment, it appears to be our duty to 
take up this work in a comprehensive way. Thus would be built up 
not only a national museum but an American museum in the widest 
sense. This applies not only to anthropology but to the other great 
departments of the Museum. It will be impossible to carry on such a 
work without turning over to the Department of Anthropology the 
entire present building, with all of its laboratory and exhibition space. 

Second. — The Department of Biology now occupies a large exhibi- 
tion space in the Smithsonian building and 55,000 square feet in the 
National Museum building. Large collections, which would be placed 
on exhibition if space were available, are stored in laboratories and 
inclosed spaces in the exhibition halls. As has already been explained, 
in a new building there should be available for the Department of 
Biology 190,000 square feet of exhibition, laboratory, and storage space. 

The present exhibit is more complete than that of the other depart- 
ments of the Museum. Of birds there is a large mounted series, one 
of the finest in existence, but it is so indiiferently housed that it fails 
to make the impression it should. Of mammals there is a good North 
American series and some excellent examj^les of exotic species. There 
is a good and rather large exhibit of the various groups of the lower 
forms of animals, including an especially fine series of corals and 
sponges. 

These are the only series at present exhibited whicli can be considered 
at all comprehensive. Of the great groups of fishes, reptiles, and 
amphibians there is room only for an outline representation. The 
wonderful variety of form among insects can be scarcely more than sug- 
gested in the space available. Of plants there has hitherto been no 
exhibit worthy of the name, and the space which it has now been pos- 
sible to set aside is entirely out of proportion to the vast extent and 
importance of this great kingdom of nature. 

Every natural-history museum of the first class should have at least 
two comprehensive exhibition series — first, the Systematic Series, repre- 
senting the natural groups among which all animals and plants, from 
the highest to the lowest, are divided; second, the Faunal and Floral 
Series, showmg the animals and i)lants characteristic of each of the 
grand divisions of the earth's surface which naturalists have established 
as a result of their studies of these two kingdoms of nature. 

These two great comprehensive exhibits should be supplemented by 
a number of Special Series, illustrating the more interesting phenomena 
and phases of life, such as the macroscopic and microscopic structure of 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 15 

auimals and plants and their development from the germ to the fully 
adult individual, and special modifications of form and color by which 
animals are protected from their enemies, the adaptations for peculiar 
environments and modes of life, the characteristics of youth, maturity, 
and old age, the variation in form, size, and color among individuals of 
the same species, the domiciles and other works constructed by birds, 
mammals, insects, and the like. 

To these series should be added another of great importance, the 
Economic Series, representing the animals and plants as related to the 
activities and needs of man. 

Any one of these principal series in its full development would more 
than fill the entire space now available. 

Third. — There should be developed a museum of practical geology in 
the broadest sense, which will be of service to every producer and con- 
sumer of American mineral products, and to all students of geology who 
are engaged in either economic or purely scientific investigations. 

In addition to the series of rocks and fossils illustrating the stratig- 
raphy and succession of the sedimentary rocks and the systematic col- 
lection of minerals and ores, an exhibit showing how geologic work 
benefits the daily life of the people should be developed. An illustra- 
tion of this would be a representation of the artesian water supply of 
the semi arid region, showing the stratification and structure of the 
sedimentary rocks, and how hydrographic and geological investigations 
clearly indicate the regions in which artesian water development may 
be carried on successfully. Mining and areal geology could also be 
illustrated in such manner as to place before the student and intelligent 
observer the import and value of such work. 

In most museums the principal effort has been to make a collection 
of useful mineral products. This is desirable, but from a broad view of 
illustrating the practical in addition to the scientific side of geology it 
should be secondary. The best basis for classification on the practical 
side of the museum exhibit aj^pears to be the finished mineral product. 
For instance, if pig iron be taken as a key material in classification, 
the iron ores from which it has been obtained shduld be arranged so 
as to show the various kinds whose combination has resulted in the 
final result as pig iron. In connection with this should be grouped the 
geological phenomena, which should include representations of any 
geological conditions connected with the original deposition and the 
occurrence of iron ores. This might include the conditions which have 
led to the oxidation of pyrite and other sulphur compounds of iron, and 
to the development of hydrous oxides of iron ; also an illustration of what 
has been demonstrated in regard to the solution of widely distributed 
minerals in certain rocks and their subsequent concentration in ore 
bodies by metasomatic action. All of the metals could be arranged 
under such a classification, as also the nonmetallic products. To pre- 
pare such an exhibit would require many years of work, the details of 
which would be considered as each mineral product was taken in hand. 



16 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Some of the preceding suggestions have been adopted by the Museum 
authorities and partially put into execution, and the carrying of them 
out is dependent upon enlarged facilities for laboratory work and exhi- 
bition space. During the administration of Dr. Goode, the Museum 
developed as far as possible under the conditions surrounding it. No 
one knew better than he that only by securing new buildings and ex- 
panding the Museum could it take the place in America that the sev- 
eral national museums of Europe had taken in their respective coun- 
tries. It is well recognized that a public museum is a necessity in 
every highly civilized community, and that, as has been so well stated 
by Dr. Goode, "the degree of civilization which any nation, city, or 
province has attained is best shown by the character of its public mu- 
seums and the liberality with which they are maintained." At present 
New York City is, in this respect, in advance of all other American cit- 
ies and of the National Government. Whether the latter will take its 
proper place by developing the National Museum as it has developed 
the National Library remains to be seen. The question whether they 
are willing to be represented by the Museum as it is to-day is before 
the American people.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY 
FOR THE YEAR 1897-98. 

By William H. Holmes, 
Head Curator. 

It is convenient to present the matter of the present report under the 
following heads : 

I. General administrative work. 
11. Acquirement of Museum materials. 

III. Preservation of collections. 

IV. Classification and research. 
V. Installation. 

VI. The Anthropological exhibit at the Trans-Mississippi and 
International Exposition. 

GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE WORK. 

A partial reorganization of the Museum made at the beginning of 
the year resulted in the formation of three departments, one of which 
is Anthropology. The various divisions and sections dealing with man 
and his works, which have been conducted independently of one 
another, the curators and custodians reporting directly to the Assist- 
ant Secretary in charge of the Museum, are now united under a head 
curator of anthropology. This operates to give direct exj^ert super- 
vision of all the divisions and properly correlates the various branches 
of a complex work. The head curator took charge October 1, 1897, and a 
number of changes were made in the scientific staff" of the department 
and in the limitations of the fields occupied by the various curators 
and custodians. The present organization is indicated in Appendix 1. 

There are a number of sections included in the dejiartment not yet 
assigned to any one of the above divisions, and these remain for the 
l)resent under the direct supervision of the head curator. The present 
classification of the material and the assignment of the staff" are by 
no njeans final. It was found impossible to devise a scheme that 
would satisfy the requirements of scientific classification and at the 
same time accommodate itself to the acquirements of the present 
staff, which is composed of persons devoted each to special portions of 
the field of anthropology. It is expected that as the various branches 
of the work become fully developed and the collections are enriched 
and rounded out so that a systematic treatment of the whole field is 
possible, the questions of reclassification and rearrangement of the 
force will gradually adjust themselves. 

19 



20 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

The clerical and other nonscieutific work of the department has been 
conducted as in preceding years, save that some changes in routine, 
intended to facilitate the transaction of business, have been introduced. 
Official correspondence is carried on almost wholly through the Museum 
Office of Correspondence and the executive officer of the Museum. The 
records are thus less scattered and more generally accessible than if in 
the hands of many individuals. The work of receiving, recording, 
marking, and i^lacing accessions is well provided for in the official rou- 
tine, and the necessary poisoning of specimens, repairs, making of 
replicas and models, the building of group exhibits, etc., are in the 
hands of expert preparators. 

During the year two notable episodes have diversified the work of 
the department, viz, the building of galleries, and the preparation of 
exhibits for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition held in Omaha. Iron 
galleries were constructed in four of the seven anthropological halls 
and this has not only seriously interfered with the progress of installa- 
tion, throwing the halls affected into confusion for several months, but 
has made it necessary to reinstall the major part of the exhibits in all 
the halls. From year to year the spaces have become gradually over- 
crowded with exhibits, and the opening of the galleries afforded the 
opportunity of relieving the congestion in part. The first step in this 
reassemblage of collections was the selection of furniture to accord 
with the spaces and the collections, and the head curator has devoted 
much time to the utilization of the various styles of cases to the best 
advantage. Necessary alterations and repairs were made in cases, 
pedestals, screens, etc., as the work progressed. In reassembling the 
furniture, much attention was given to the opening of thoroughfares, 
the widening of spaces, and in systematizing and simplifying the instal- 
lation. The work on the main floor is now well advanced, but, in the 
galleries where wall cases are in process of construction and in halls 
where floors are being laid, it remains far from complete. 

For a period of three months, ending with June 1, the energies of 
the department were largely devoted to the i)reparation of an exhibit 
for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, a detailed account of which is 
given in another place. 

ACQUIREMENT OF MUSEUM MATERIALS. 

A primary function of the department is the acquirement of Museum 
materials. These materials include sj)ecimens and the data relating to 
them. Specimens consist of the actual objects, derived from every 
part of the anthropological field, and of models and casts, as well as 
of photographs and other representations of the actual objects. The 
channels through which they are acquired are (1) gift; (2) transfer (from 
the Smithsonian Institution and departments of the Government); 
(3) purchase; (4) collection; (5) exchange, and (6) manufacture. To 
these materials are added deposit or loan collections, the treatment of 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 21 

which is identical with that of bona fide acquisitions. The adminis- 
tration of the function of acquisition in the department is uniform 
with that of other departments. 

Gifts. — The accessions for the year have been numerous and valuable, 
and details relating to them will be found in another place. Among 
the gifts are some of notable importance. A collection of antiquities 
and ethouological material, the bequest of the late W. Hallett Phillips, 
of Washington, is not only of great extent but of exceptional value to 
archaeological science, having been collected and recorded with care by 
Mr. Phillips, who was a conscientious and discriminating devotee of 
archaeological research. The collection contains 12,467 ancient relics, 
mainly stone implements from the Potomac region, and 106 ethnolog- 
ical specimens from Polynesia. The latter material was collected by 
Mr. Henry Adams, of Washington, during a ijrolonged voyage among 
the Pacific islands. 

Transfers. — The Smithsonian Institution, through the agency of its 
Bureau of American Ethnology, has acquired by purchase and trans- 
ferred to the Museum two collections of importance — a valuable series 
of ancient stone and earthenware utensils from graves and mounds in 
Arkansas, and a collection of antiquities from mounds of the well-known 
Etowah group of Georgia, made by Dr. Koland Steiner, of Grovetown, 
Georgia, The latter lot, together with the material previously obtained 
from the same locality by agents of the Bureau of Ethnology, forms 
one of the most instructive assemblages of archiieological material ever 
brought together from the mound region. 

A noteworthy accession of the year is a collection of 2,206 human 
crania transferred to the Museum from the Army Medical Museum, 
through the courtesy of Surgeon-General G. M. Sternberg. This col- 
lection has been accumulating for many years and represents mainly 
the Indian tribes, ancient and modern, of North America. Much of 
the material was acquired through National Museum agencies and was 
turned over to the Medical Museum for the benefit of the corps of 
students of physical anthropology connected with that institution. It 
includes only nonpathologic remains and is to form the nucleus of a 
division of physical anthropology in the Anthropological Department. 

Deposits. — Of the various collections loaned to the Museum during 
the year, and at the same time offered for sale, two are of more than 
usual importance. (1) A very extensive series of stone implements 
and other ancient relics from various parts of Georgia, owned by Dr. 
Roland Steiner, and (2) a collection of ethnological material from the 
Great Plains and Eocky Mountain Indian tribes, made by Emile 
Granier, of Paris. It is expected that these collections will be acquired 
by the Museum at an early date. Other loan collections worthy of note 
are (1) a series of personal mementos of Gen. W. S. Hancock, deposited 
by Cadet G. K. Hancock, of West Point Military Academy, and a num- 
ber of important Jewish religious ceremonial objects deposited by Mr. 



22 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

H. E. Beuguiat. A valuable collection of Japanese porcelains, loaned 
by Miss E. R. Scidmore, is now installed in the Gallery of Ceramics. 

The Section of Electricity, Division of Mechanical Technology, has 
been especially fortunate in acquiring material, and the following state- 
ment of Mr. G. C. Maynard, custodian of the Section of Electricity, is 
quoted from the report of Mr. J, E. Watkius, curator. 

One of the most importaut accessions received during the year is an extensive 
collection of apparatus deposited by Prof. Alexander Graham Bell. This deposit 
embraces a large number of pieces of apparatus made and used by Professor Bell in 
his experiments and researches in various branches of electrical science. The inven- 
tion and development of the speaking telephone, from the first crudi experimental 
device to the most perfect instrument now in use, is clearly illustrated by a series of 
objects showing the various advancing steps by which the new art of telephony was 
created. 

Another interesting portion of the collection is the apparatus devised and used by 
Mr. Bell in his photophonic experiments, including the original instrument with 
which, on the 2d of June, 1880, he successfully transmitted articulate s^jeech by 
means of a beam of light from the roof of the Franklin School building, in Washing- 
ton, to his laboratory on L street, a distance of 213 meters. Mr. Bell contributed his 
original induction balance apparatus, including that devised by him for the purpose 
of locating the bullet in the body of the late President Garfield, and similar appara- 
tus of later "dates. In addition to the above the accession includes Bell's multiplex 
telegraph instruments, his induction balance audiometer, for testing hearing, and 
an Edison phonograph of the earliest pattern, in which the sound waves are recorded 
on a sheet of tin foil. 

The deposits made by the General Electric Company are of much interest and value. 
Among the historical objects are the first Thomson-Houston three-coil, arc-light 
dynamo, mad(; in 1879, which formed the basis of the Thomson-Houston electric 
lighting system, the first automatic regulator used Avith this machine, a dynamo and 
electric motor used in the Thomson-Houston factory at New Britain in 1880-1881, the 
first electric welding machine made by Thomson, and many other pieces of original 
apparatus connected with the early use of electricity for lighting, the transmission 
of power, and other purposes. Another contribution from the same company is one 
of the first incandescent electric-lighting dynamos, made and put in operation by 
Edison in 1879, on board the steamship Columbia, of the Oregon Steamship Navigation 
Company, which was the first steamboat equipped with incandescent electric lights. 
This dynamo was continued in active use for a period of nearly twenty years, and 
is still serviceable. Especial interest attaches to this machine for the reason that it 
is one of the first lot of four dynamos made in this country for commercial incandes- 
cent electric lighting. One of the others formed part of the equipment of the polar 
exploring vessel Jeannette, commanded by Captain De Long, on its cruise into the 
Arctic Sea, where it was lost in 1882. Contributions of a series of historical incan- 
descent lamps and specimens of insulated conductors have also been received from 
the General Electric Company. 

The Coe Brass Manufacturing Company-, of Ansonia, Connecticut, through its 
president, Mr. George F. Brooker, presented to the Museum ten dynamos made 
between the years 1873 and 1879, by William Wallace, for the generation of elec- 
tricity for electric lighting, electroplating, and other purposes. Some of these 
machines were in practical operation during the Centennial Exposition at Philadel- 
phia, and are said to be the first arc-light dynamos used for jiublic lighting in this 
country. 

An electric generator of still earlier date than any of those referred to was made 
by Charles A. Seeley in 1867. In regard to this machine it is said that early in the 
year 1867, when the principle of self-excitation in dynamos was new, and in fact

practically uuknowu except to a few of the most advanced eleetriciaus in this coun- 
try, the subject of electric lighting was broached by Professor Seeley to Mr. Horace 
Greeley. Mr. Greeley became deeply interested and highly amused at the idea of 
grinding out electricity with a crank and then making light of it, as he expressed 
his understanding of Professor Seeley's descrii^tion of an arc light operated by a 
dynamo. Mr. Greeley suggested that Seeley should build a dynamo and other appa- 
ratus, which were accordingly started at once. The satisfactory results of the 
experiment led to the publication of an editorial in Mr. Greeley's paper, the New 
York Tribune, on March 28, 1867, which foreshadowed the success that has since 
been attained in the art of electric lighting. The Seeley dynamo and the original 
electric motor and railway devised in 1834 by Thomas Davenport, who was the first 
inventor of a method of applying galvanism to produce rotary motion, were received 
as a deposit from the American Institute of Electrical Engineers through Ralph W. 
Pope, the secretary of the organization. 

The dynamos added to the section during the year represent almost the entire 
range of American inventions which form the basis of the practical methods of elec- 
tric lighting, both by arc and incandescent lamps, and mark an important epoch in 
the history of artificial illumination. Duplicates of few, if any, of these machines 
are in existence. 

A Morse telegraph register, presented to the Smithsonian Institution by Prof. 
Henrj' Ortmanu, of Baltimore, by direction of the late Rev, Henry Schieb, appears 
to be of especial interest. The instrument was in the possession of Mr. Schieb for 
many years, and is said to have been used on a private telegraph line operated by 
him and Professor Morse prior to the building of the public line between AVashington 
and Baltimore in 1844. 

Mr. Edward L. Morse has during the year deposited several instruments and doc- 
uments relating to his father's telegraphic inventions. 

There have been added to the Henry collection a number of experimental electrical 
instruments found by Miss Mary A. Henry in the possession of Miss Annie Wrightsen, 
of Albany, from whom the apparatus was purchased. 

Besulfs of exploration. — Explorations begun during the preceding 
year, under tlie auspices of the Bureau of American Ethnology, have 
yielded material of great value. Excavations conducted by Dr. J. 
Walter Fewkes, near Tucson, Arizona, have resulted in the acquisition 
of some 1,300 specimens of pottery and other classes of relics, and Mr. 
J. B. Hatcher, collecting for the Bureau of Ethnology, has forwarded a 
number of unique ethnological si)ecimeus from Patagonia. Explora- 
tions undertaken in Brown County, Ohio, by Mr. Gerard Fowke, also 
for the Bureau, yielded a limited collection of relics from stone-grave 
burials of the mound builders. 

Exchange. — The exchanges have not been important, although col- 
lections of considerable value have been acquired, as follows: (1) Vari- 
ous ethnological and archaeological objects from South America iu 
exchange for pueblo collections with the Field Columbian Museum, of 
Chicago. (2) A series of flint nodnles, flaked flints, and flint working- 
tools from the gun-flint factories of Brandon, England, in exchange 
for chert quarry refuse from Indian Territory. 

Manufacture. — The department relies for many of its most interest- 
ing and instructive exhibits upon the skill of its curators and expert 
preparators. During the year a number of models have been prepared 
illustrating primitive life, processes, implements, utensils, etc., and 



24 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

numerous reproductions of objects of interest, in plaster, have been 
made. 

Notwithstanding the large number of accessions and their undoubted 
yalue, it should be noted that the results of the year's collection are not 
wholly satisfactory. The meagerness of funds for j^urchase has made 
it impossible to secure some of the most important collections offered, 
and as no provision is made for exploration and systematic expert col- 
lection, it is found that, save for the occasional well-ordered collections 
donated or transferred, the acquisitions are fragmentary and lack the 
detailed data so essential to the student engaged in research. 

PRESERVATION OF COLLECTIONS. 

Following the acquisition of museum materials are various steps 
looking to their preservation. The collections for the year have been 
accessioned, recorded, and marked as usual, and have been stored or 
placed in the study or exhibition series by the curators. The depart- 
ment suffers much inconvenience from lack of space and facilities 
for handling the collections. Instead of a well-ordered laboratory in 
which to open, spread out, examine, compare, and classify specimens as 
they arrive or as subsequent resea^rch goes on, small portions of the 
exhibition halls have been screened off for the purpose, thus interfering 
with installation, and often rendering hasty removals and premature 
storage necessary. At the close of the year one entire gallery is 
devoted to laboratory uses and is thus necessarily closed to the public. 
I regard the lack of laboratory space as extremely detrimental to the 
interests of the department. 

A large part of the ethnological collections require expert attention 
on their arrival in the Museum. They are unclean and infested with 
destructive insects, and experienced preparators are required for clean- 
ing and preserving. The latter work is carried on in a small shop in 
an outbuilding. This is very inconvenient and requires the removal of 
the collections to be treated from the Museum building to one which 
is by no means a safe repository for valuable specimens. 

The question of storage of material has arisen many times during the 
year, and numerous collections have been removed to storage. The 
exhibition halls, although much less crowded than at the beginning of 
the year, still contain more material than can be properly exhibited. 
The total surplus is, therdfore, very great. The present exhibits occupy 
60,000 square feet of space, the entire floor space of the Museum being 
only about 100,000 feet. The anthropological collections properly 
installed would fill the entire Museum building. 

CLASSIFICATION AND RESEARCH. 

The third important function of the department relates to the use of 
the collections in conducting researches looking to exhibition and pub- 
lication. All possible information relating to the specimens is secured, 



REPORT OP ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 25 

and tbey are .studied, compared, and classified. This work is essential 
to their intelligent utilization, and necessarily i)recedes installation and 
publication. It is tlie work which most constantly employs the atten- 
tion of the curators and is referred to at length in the reports which 
they have submitted. 

Eesearches having in view publication of results have been conducted 
by Prof. O. T. Mason, Dr. Walter Hough, Mr. J. E. Watkins, and Dr. 
Thomas Wilson. In several cases collectors have engaged in the study 
of the collections made by themselves. This is true especially of Dr. 
Fewkes, Mr. Gushing, Mrs. M. C. Stevenson, and Mr. Stewart Culin. 
Mr. J. D. McGuire has i^repared a monograph on tobacco i)ipes, employ- 
ing the collections of the Divisions of Ethnology and Prehistoric Archse- 
ology, and Dr. Edward Eggleston, and Dr. H. Carrington Bolton have 
made studies of portions of the Copp collection of colonial relics in the 
Division of History and Biography. 

INSTALLATION. 

Display of collections constitutes a most important function of the 
Museum; it may be regarded as the essential function, since all others 
are as well subserved by the storehouse and laboratory. Public dis- 
play is the feature that gives the Museum its status as an educational 
institution. The all-imj)ortant question then is, in what way and by 
what methods shall the department undertake to instruct by means of 
its exhibits? Exhibition is not regarded simply as the presentation of 
the materials of a museum so that the public may see them. The 
essential point is the presentation in such logical order that the great 
truths of human history may be told in the briefest and dearest way. 

There are several methods of i^resenting the materials of anthro- 
pology, but two of these are of primary importance and are used to the 
practical exclusion of the others. The first is the geographical or 
ethnograpliieal assemblage, and the second the developmental or genetic 
assemblage. Other methods may be classed as special; they are the 
chronological, the comparative, the individual, etc. The first mentioned 
methods are adapted to the presentation of the general truths of 
anthropology, and the special methods are available for limited por- 
tions of the field — for special or limited ideas which are to be fully 
elaborated. 

THE GEOGRAPHICAL OR ETHNOGRAPHICAI, ARRANGEMENT. 

The most natural assemblage of the materials illustrating the peoples 
of the world is in groups related one to another as are the peoples 
themselves in more or less well-defined geograi)hical divisions. Thus 
assembled it is possible for the student or the ordinary museum visitor 
to make his studies pretty much as he would make them in traveling 
from country to country. The museum on this i)lan is a miniature 
world, so far as the objective materials of anthropology are capable of 



26 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



coustituting such a world. Under tliis method of classification all 
collections coming into the possession of the Museum may be intelli- 
gently assembled. From this assemblage, whether as exhibition or 
study series, selections of duplicate objects may be made for building 
up exhibits illustrating the history of man as seen from other points 
of view. 

The materials employed in this grand division of the exhibits are 
not yet brought together in the Museum in their final relationships. 
The collections relating to living tribes and nations are separated from 
those representing prehistoric peoples of the same areas, the latter 
occupying the great hall of the Smithsonian Institution. It is hoped 
that in the near future the construction of a new building, or a 
reassignment of the present Museum spaces, may lead to the proper 
correlation of these important exhibits. 



THE DEVELOPMENTAL ARRANGEMENT. 

The second grand division of exhibits assumes to present selected 
portions of the collections on a totally different plan from the pre- 
ceding, and they are thus made to record and convey a totally distinct 
class of ideas. The story told by these exhibits is not that of tribes 
or .nations and their connection with particular environments, but 
that of development of the race along the various lines of culture prog- 
ress, each series beginning with the inceptive or lowest stages and 
extending to the highest. These series are synoptic in character. 

The following exhibits arranged on this j)lan have already been 
assembled or are in process of segregation: 



Fire luakiug 1 series 

Hunting 1 series 

Fishing 1 series 

Agriculture 2 series 

Weapons 6 series 

Tools of general use 8 series 

Culinary arts 4 series 

Illumination 3 series 

House building 1 series 

Textiles 3 series 

Costume 2 series 

Ceramics 3 series 



Glass 1 series 

Enamel 1 series 

Metallurgy 1 series 

Sculpture 4 series 

Graphic arts 4 series 

Metric arts 3 series 

Music 4 series 

Medicine 1 series 

Photography 3 series 

Transportation 10 series 

Electricity 8 series 



Each specimen in these series stands not as an isolated product of 
activity, but for an idea — a step in human progress; each series is a 
logical assemblage of these ideas — these steps in human progress, and 
the order is such as to suggest to the mind the broatler truths of human 
history. The group of series properly arranged serves to illustrate the 
development of human thought and the gradual expansion of human 
interests.

.SPECIAL ASSKMBLAGE— CIIKONOUxaCAL, CYCLOPEOtCAL, COMPARA'llVK. 

There are iuuumerable subjects covering limited portions of the 
anthropological field that call for special elaboration and separate 
assemblage of materials. The history of a single nation may be thus 
treated, as, for example, the history of the United States, a most 
approi>riate subject for our National Museum; the history of France, 
ai)propriate to a French museum, the order of pi'esentatiou being chron- 
ological. An elaborate assemblage of exhibits may be nnide for cyclo- 
pedical or reference use merely, as in the case of our former section of 
materia medica, but this method is not applicable to any large portion 
of the field of anthropology. Other exhibits still may serve for pur- 
poses of comparison of what different peoples do living under distinct 
environments, as, for example, the series of drinking vessels in the 
East Hall; of what has been accomplished by different nations or 
establishments, as in the ceramic section. 

PLACEMENT OE EXHIBITS. 

The accompanying ground plan will serve to indicate the distribution 
of the grand divisions of exhibits in the Museum building. The col- 
lections of prehistoric arch;eology, placed in the great hall of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, belong to Group A, 




Grand diviaions of anthropological exhibits in tho Museum building. 

The areas occui)ied by tlie three grand divisions are indicated by let-

A. Geographical presentation of men and culture. 

B. Developmental presentation of human activities. 

C. Special presentations of activities and phenomena.

seuted with as much completeuess as the limitations of the natioual 
collections will permit. Three of these halls are occupied by American 
materials and one by exhibits representing the remainder of the world. 

In the West North rJange or Catlin Hall (formerly the lecture hall) 
are brought together, for the first time in any degree of completeness, 
very extensive collections obtained from Indian tribes of the great 
region which extends from the Atlantic coast to the Rocky Mountains. 
These are arranged primarily by provinces, and secondarily by stocks 
and tribes, but as yet they are only tentatively placed, as the entire 
hall is to be cleared in the near future for laying a floor and building 
galleries. 

The walls of this hall are completely covered with portraits and 
scenes representing mainly the great group of tribes assigned to the 
hall. They are the work of George Catlin, the noted traveler and 
artist. To this hall are assigned also various groups of lay figures 
illustrating the tribes concerned, and the windows are to be embellished 
with a series of photographic transparencies covering the same ground. 

The hall known as the Northwest Range contains collections from 
numerous Indian tribes of the northwest coast region, assembled at the 
north end, and very complete exhibits from the Eskimo tribes of the 
arctic regions, assembled in the south end of the hall. 

The Northwest Court (Pueblo Court) contains exhibits pertaining to 
the great group of town-building tribes of Arizona, New Mexico, and 
adjacent sections, known as Pueblo (town) Indians. The antiquities of 
the region are also included, as they are known for the most part to per- 
tain to the same general group of peoples. The collection of pottery 
is very extensive, and the series of lay figure industrial and ceremonial 
groups make the display more than usually attractive. 

In the gallery of this court are assembled, though not yet fully 
installed, collections from the tribes of the great arid region of the 
Southwest, other than the Pueblos, as well as limited series of objects 
representing the tribes of Mexico, Central America, and South America. 

The West Hall contains extensive collections from a multitude of 
peoples of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and the gallery in the north side 
is occupied by materials from Australia and the Indo- Pacific Islands. 

Grand Division B, which includes exhibits arranged to illustrate the 
progress and achievements of the race in many of its principal arts 
and industries, occupies three halls and two galleries in the northeast 
section of the building. A few additional exhibits belonging to this 
division are still installed in other sections of the Museum. The prin- 
ciples upon which they are assembled have been exjilained elsewhere. 
In East Hall adjoining the Rotunda is placed a group of exhibits 
epitomizing the history of various arts, domestic and industrial. In 
the eastern portion of the hall are collections illustrating transporta- 
tion, electricity, 'physical experimentation, etc. 

The Northeast Range (Boat Hall) is occupied by a very extensive 



REPOKT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 29 

collection of boats, models of boats, and other exhibits exemplifying 
the development of water transportation, and esj)ecially the progress 
in steam navigation achieved in recent years by American inventors. 

The Xortheast Court, main floor, contains the remarkable collections 
illustrating the graphic arts brought together by Mr. S. R. Koehler, 
honorary curator, and the gallery is devoted to ceramics and examples 
of art i^roducts in glass, enamel, lacquer, metal, and ivory. 

The exhibit of materia medica, brought to a high degree of com- 
pleteness by the honorary curator. Dr. J. M. Flint, TJ. S. N"., is installed 
in the East Hall Gallery (north side). The more comprehensive title 
of Division of Medicine having been substituted for that of "materia 
medica," heretofore used, it is proposed to arrange and develop the 
collection on the lines adopted for other branches of human activity, 
and to attempt to illustrate the history of medicine, or the evolution 
of ideas concerning disease and its treatment. The following provi- 
sional classification is taken from Dr. Flint's annual report: 

A. Magical Medicine. 

1. Exorcism, invocation, and incantation. 

2. Amulets, talismans, and fetiches. 

B. Psychical Medicine. 

1. "Laying on of hands." 

2. Suggestion. 

3. Hypnotism. 
i. Faith cure. 

C. Physical and External Medicine. 

1. Baths, massage, exercise, electricity. 

2. Surgery, including acupuncture, cautery, blood letting, and surgical 

operations in general. 

D. Physiological or Internal Medicine. 

1. Drugs (illustrations arranged in the following groups: (a) Egyptian 
medicine; (b) Greek medicine; (c) Hindoo medicine; (d) Arabian 
medicine; (e) Oriental medicine; (/) Indian medicine; (g) Modern 
medicine. 

E. Preventive Medicine. 

1. Water. 

2. Air. 

3. Food. 

4. Beverages and condiments. 

5. Soils. 

6. Habitations. 

7. Clothing. 

8. Climate. 

9. Disposal of the dead. 
10. Disinfection. 

The third grand division of exhibits, the Special, is represented by a 
number of collections of importance. The Korth Hall is occupied by 
a large series of exhibits arranged chronologically to illustrate the 
history of the United States. Beginning at the left, just within the 
north door, the period of discovery is presented. This is followed in 
order by the Colonial and Revolutionary periods, the war of 1812-14, 



30 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

the Mexican war, etc. Continuing on the west side are collections 
illustrating the period of the civil war and notable personages and 
episodes pertaining to it and to succeeding periods. 

The Division of Eeligions occupies the West Hall Gallery (south side), 
where interesting exhibits are assembled in groups illustrating the 
Jewish, Mohammedan, Buddhistic, and other religions. The large col- 
lection of musical instruments occupies the wall cases of the North Hall ; 
various collections of ceramic products, glass, metal work, etc., grouped 
by peoples or manufacturing establishments, are placed in the gallery 
of the Northeast Court, and exhibits illustrating the composition of 
the human body and the analysis of foods and drinks occupy part of the 
East Hall Gallery (north side). 

ANTHROPOLOGrCAL EXHIBIT OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM AT 
THE TRANS-MISSISSIPPI AND INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION. 

The frequency with which the National Museum has been called upon 
to prepare exposition exhibits has made it somewhat difficult to secure 
fresh and interesting material for display. To obviate this difficulty in 
the Department of Anthropology it was decided to assemble the limited 
group of exhibits required on a plan differing essentially from that 
adopted for previous expositions. 

Heretofore the materials have been brought together in a somewhat 
disconnected way, to illustrate particular peoples, or especial arts or 
industries as represented by their i)roducts. On the present occasion 
the activities of man are treated from the point of view of their devel- 
opment. The various lines of progress are represented by a series of 
objects, each typifying a step in the industrial and intellectual evolution 
of the race. 

As the exhibits required had to be drawn from all divisions of the 
dej)artment, a single series of objects in many cases being made up 
from the collections of two or more divisions or sections, members of 
the anthropological staff' were called upon to act as committees in assem- 
bling the exhibits in which they were personally concerned. The full 
resources of the Museum were thus drawn upon, yet the objects taken 
were so few in number as not to interfere seriously with the present 
Museum installation. 

Each series of exhibits epitomizes a single branch of art or industry 
and occupies a single case-front or fraction thereof, and may thus be 
conveniently seen at one view. The scheme of treatment or presenta- 
tion is just such as the systematic student would adopt in writing the 
history of the subject, beginning with the inceptive stages and moving 
forward step by step to the highest development. The following subjects 
are presented, beginning at the left in the cases and progressing toward 
the right: 

The use of Jire.— The story begins with the fire of volcanoes and light- 
ning and the carrying of firebrands from the sources for rekindling,

illustrated by means of colored drawings; it is continued in a series 
of exhibits showing progressive steps in the making of fire, illustrated 
by rubbing sticks, revolving drills, flint and steel, the lucifer match, 
and devices for producing the electric spark. 

Illumination. — Two series of objects are chosen, the first illustrating 
the torch in its many forms, arranged progressivly ; the second, the lamp, 
beginning with the stone cup with oil and wick and ending with the 
argand burner and the arc light. 

Fishing. — Of the various exploitative activities, so necessary to the 
sustenance of the race, only one group — the art of fishing — is repre- 
sented, others having been omitted for want of space. Series 1 illus- 
trates the dart in its multiplicity of forms; series 2, tbe various toggle 
devices ; series 3, the hook ; series 4, the sinker. 

Domestic arts. — Household arts are represented by four series — one 
epitomizing the history of cooking, and three illustrating utensils and 
devices employed in eating and drinking (the cup, the spoon, and the 
knife and fork). 

Tools of general use. — The history of the more essential tools of human 
handicraft is epitomized in seven series, each beginning with the sim- 
plest forms — mere splinters and masses of stone — and ending with the 
highest forms, the marvelous machine operated tools of to-day. They 
are the hammer, the ax, the adz, the knife, the saw, the drill, and the 
scraper. 

Weajjons. — Weapons of war have performed a most important part 
in the history of progress, and the steps that led up from the stone and 
the club held in the hand to the steel sword and compound machine 
gun are strikingly suggested in two series presented: 1, weapons for 
use in the hand — piercing and slashing weapons; and 2, projectile 
weapons — the bow and arrow, the crossbow, the pistol and gun. 

Transportation, marine. — The history of water transportation is epit- 
omized in four of its leading lines of elaboration: 1, the hull, begin- 
ning with the log raft and ending with the magnificent substructure of 
the modern ship (represented by models) ; 2, hand propulsion — the 
l)ole, the paddle and the oar (in i^art models) ; 3, the paddle wheel 
(models); and 4, the screw propeller (models). 

Transportation, land. — Land transportation is shown in six series 
(models): 1, the burden bearer, man and beast; 2, the sliding load; 3, 
tlie rolling load; 4, the wheeled vehicle; 5, the steam locomotive; and 
G, the railway track. 

The great group of elaborative activities concerned in manufacture 
is illustrated in four exhibits: The ceramic art, the textile art, metal 
work, and sculi^ture. 

Ceramic art. — In this exhibit are included four series: 1, implements 
and devices employed in manufacture — modeling tools, decorating 
tools, stamps, molds, and the throwing wheel; 2, the vase, showing 
progressive steps in shaping, decorating, and the results of firing on 



32 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

the paste and surface finish ; 3, glass making in its relation to ceramics ; 
and 4, enamel. 

Textile art— Weaving is represented by three series: 1, the spindle; 
2, the shuttle; and 3, the loom; the latter illustrating in a remarka- 
ble manner the rapid transition from primitive to highly developed 
appliances. 

3Ietal worhing. — The history of this important branch is partially 
presented in three series: 1, metal reduction; 2, products of manufac- 
ture, showing progressive order in processes, forms, and embellishments ; 
and 3, tools and appliances of manufacture. 

Sculpture. — The stone-shaping arts begin with the simplest known 
artificial modifications of natural forms and advance to the achieve- 
ment of the highest ideals as represented in Greek art. Four series 
are shown: 1, prehistoric stone shaping (Europe) ; 2, aboriginal Ameri- 
can sculpture; 3, sculpture of civilized nations ; and 4, implements used 
in stone shaping. Series 1, 2, and 3 are separated for the purpose of 
contrasting the work of distinct periods and peoples. 

Photography. — This art, the product of advanced culture, is repre- 
sented by three series of objects, epitomizing the development of: 1, the 
camera; 2, the lens; and 3, the picture. 

The hooJc. — A limited series of objects is devoted to the history of the 
book, the method of assembling the several parts — the tablets and 
sheets — being the feature considered. 

Electricity. — Electrical inventions, representing one of the youngest 
and most marvelous branches of human activity, are shown in three 
limited series — 1, experimental apparatus (Henry); 2, transmitting 
apparatus (Morse and subsequent inventors); and 3, recording appa- 
ratus. 

Music. — Four series are devoted to the history of as many varieties 
of musical instruments — 1, wind instruments; 2, reed instruments; 3, 
stringed instruments; and 4, percussion instruments. 

The system of arranging these series is such as to make them fully 
intelligible to the average museum or exposition visitor. A large label 
or sign is framed and placed outside of each case at the top; a general 
label for each exhibit, giving briefly the history of the subject treated, 
is framed and placed inside the case. Also a label explaining each 
progressive series is placed at the beginning of the series, and individ- 
ual labels describing the specimens are placed with the specimens. 

Associated with these developmental series are a number of life- 
size figures, modeled in plaster and appropriately costumed, intended 
to illustrate the practice of the arts in their primitive stages. They 
give a vivid impression of primitive processes and serve to contrast 
these with the methods and machinery of advanced civilization. The 
subjects presented are as follows: 

The fire maker. — A Ute Indian making fire by twirling, between the 
palms of his hands, a wooden shaft with its point set into a second 
piece of wood.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY 
FOR THE YEAR 1897-98. 

By FiiEDKRicK W. True, 
Head Curator. 

The Department of Biology was established at the opening of the 
fiscal year, July 1, 1897, by bringing together under a separate admin- 
istrative head the several zoological divisions already existing in the 
Museum, and the Division of Plants. The collections represented by 
these various divisions together constitute the larger part of the 
Museum, and have been accumulating for nearly half a century. The 
majority of the divisions themselves have been in existence since the 
reorganization of the Museum, in 1881, and several of them for a much 
longer period. 

On account of the great length of time that the collections have 
been in existence, and the well defined and long-established methods of 
systematic zoology and botany, no radical changes in the mode of con- 
ducting the administrative or scientific business of the divisions has 
been necessary or in contemplation. The efforts of the head curator 
in the past year have been, as they probably will be in the future, 
largely in the direction of developing those features which in the past, 
for various causes, have not had due prominence. 

The conditions prevailing as regards space and amount of assistance 
are far from ideal, and until much increased facilities in these direc- 
tions have been provided it seems improbable that any great general 
advance can be made. 

On the side of the exhibition of collections (the matter which appeals 
most directly to the public) the deficiency is in the nature of insuffi- 
cient and unsuitable space. Without a rearrangement which would 
involve both of the other departments of the Museum and an amount 
of work incommensurate with the result obtained, the proper sequence 
of exhibition collections can not be had in the present (quarters. 

At the close of the last year the birds, reptiles, fishes, and mollusks 
and other invertebrates, except insects, were displayed in the Smithso- 
nian building, while the mammals, insects, and collections representing 
comj)arative anatomy were displayed in the Museum building. As any 
general transfer of the birds is impracticable at the present time, 
endeavor was made to at least somewhat improve the sequence by 
removing the insects to the Smithsonian building and transferring the 
exhibits of batrachians, reptiles, and fishes to the Museum building. 
This was accomplished without a great amount of labor or expense,

and is u gaiu to the extent of bringing all the exhibits of invertebrates 
together in the Smithsonian bnildiiig. 

The erection of galliBries in the Mnseum building, while it did not 
involve as much rearrangement in this department as in those of 
anthropology and geology, nevertheless made a complete reinstalla- 
tion of the large exhibition series of mammals unavoidable. 

This change brought to view the desirability of having the zoologi- 
cal collections, for the most part at least, arranged in accordance with 
some one comprehensive plan. While many schemes of more or less 
merit suggested themselves, the limitations as regards the extent and 
character of the space at commaiul were such as to preclude most of 
them; while the anticipation that a new building may be provided at 
no very distant time in the future, made the adoi)tion of others seem 
undesirable. After giving the matter serious thought, I decided that 
the zoological exhibits should be arranged on a faunal basis, special 
prominence being given to the faunas of the United States. This prin- 
cipal series is to be supplemented by various smaller special series, 
illustrating important topics in biology. The adoption of this plan, it 
is believed, will cause the exhibits to be more significant and more 
attractive to the public than hitherto, and at the same time the labor 
and expense involved in effecting the modification will be limited. 

A good start in this direction has been made during the past year in 
connection with the mammals, batrachians, reptiles, and fishes. Tlie 
greatest change, as already stated, was made necessary in the Division 
of Mammals on account of the erection of galleries in the south hall of 
the Museum building, in which the exhibits are placed. The cases con- 
taining groups of large mammals could no longer stand in the center 
of the hall, and were therefore arranged at the sides under the galleries. 
The main floor is now devoted to an American faunal collection, and 
the galleries to the faunas of the rest of the world. It is the intention 
to make the North American series complete, but other faunas can only 
be represented by genera, even if it were desirable to do so, on account 
of lack of space. The old wall cases were removed to the gallery, and 
it is the intention to add to them at the beginning of the next fiscal 
year, so that they will occupy the whole of the wall surface on both 
sides of the gallery. Floor cases along the railings will be employed 
for the smaller species. 

The American batrachians, reptiles, and fishes were brought together 
in the southeast range. At the close of the year the cases in the SiniMi- 
sonian building containing marine invertebrates were rearranged, but 
a complete reinstallation of the specimens and a modification of a 
majority of the cases will be needed. The cases containing exhibits of 
insects were removed, as already stated, to the Smithsonian building, 
but no work has as yet been done on them. No extensive change is at 
present in contemplation in connection with the exhibits of birds, mol- 
lusks, or comparative anatomy. 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 37 

Hitherto the Museam has had no botanical exhibition series, except 
a small collectiou of specimens of native and foreign woods, pictures of 
trees, etc., intended to illustrate the siibject of forestry. This collection 
was withdrawn from exhibition some years ago. To form a really 
significant botanical exhibit it is recognized that it will be necessary to 
begin de novo. Any advance in this direction is hedged about by dif- 
ficulties because of iusnfficient space. A beginning has, however, been 
made by mounting under glass a representative series of seaweeds. 
To these it is the intention to add outline series representing other 
groups of plants, and to supplement these by special exhibits, such as 
illustrations of poisonous plants, models of poisonous and edible fungi, 
etc. The plans for these are, however, subject to modification in the 
coming months, and it is even jwssible that the construction of galleries 
in the ranges, and in particular in tlie southeast range, for which pro- 
vision was made by Congress, will prevent any further installation of 
exhibition collections during the coming year. 

The additions to the zoological and botanical collections during the 
year have been very numerous, and in some directions unusually 
important. First should be mentioned the donation by Messrs. Henry 
G. Hubbard and E. A. Schwarz of their collection of Coleoptera, 
principally North American, comprising about 200,000 specimen^, and 
representing, approximately, 12,000 species. The addition of this great 
and important collectiou places the National Museum in advance of all 
others as regards North American Coleoptera, and the generosity of 
the donors in presenting this vast amount of material, which they 
have accumulated with so much labor and expense, can not be too 
highly extolled. 

The labors of Dr. W. L. Abbott, who for so many years has been a 
most generous benefactor of the Museum, demand liberal commenda- 
tion. During the past year this indefatigable collector presented to 
the Museum large collections of birds, mammals, reptiles, insects, and 
other animals from Lower Siam and Kashmir. The Abbott collection 
comprises the larger portion of the most valuable Old World material of 
the Museum. Dr. W. L. Ralph has continued his valuable gratuitous 
additions to the collection of birds' eggs, and in this connection should 
also be mentioned the gift of Prof. Dean C. Worcester, of Ann Arbor, 
Michigan, comprising more than 600 bird skins, 900 eggs, and 250 
birds' nests from the Philippine Islands. The friendly cooperation of 
Dr. L. T. Chamberlain has resulted in large additions to the collection 
of fresh- water mussels. The largest acquisition of the year in this direc- 
tion was the gift of Dr. R. Ellsworth Call, of Cincinnati, comprising 
over 86,000 specimens. Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston, Massachusetts, 
presented a very interesting series of bird skins, 170 in number, from 
Santa Marta, Colombia. 

The additions to the herbarium for the year exceed 40,000 specimens, 
of which about one-half were obtained by purchase. Gifts of plants 



38 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

have been numerous and amount together to about 4,000 specimens. 
Prof. O. F. Cook presented Cr>L> specimens of Liberian plants in excel- 
lent condition and of much interest. Dr. B. L. Eobiuson, of Cam- 
bridge, Massachusetts, presented a large series of valuable Mexican 
plants, numbering in all about 1,700 specimens. These were admirably 
supplemented by another collection of Mexican plants presented by 
Mr. E. A. Goldman, of Alila, California. About 6,000 plants were 
acquired by exchange during the year. 

As already stated, about 20,000 herbarium specimens were pur- 
chased. Every important American collection offered for sale was 
obtained, with the result that the National Herbarium has been greatly 
enriched. 

The scientific bureaus of the Government, particularly the IT. S. Fish 
Commission and the Biological Survey and Division of Botany of the 
Department of Agriculture, have continued to make very valuable 
additions to the national collections. Especially to be mentioned are 
the invertebrates collected by the naturalists of the Albatross, in ISOn, 
on the coasts of California, Japan, and Kamchatka, and in Bering Sea, 
and the specimens obtained by the assistants of the Commission during 
the past thirteen years, comprising more than 600 lots. Numerous 
valuable types and cotypes of different species of fishes collected by 
the Commission have also been transmitted. The Biological Snrvey 
collected in Mexico a large series of land shells, which are regarded by 
Mr. Dall, the curator of the Division of Mollusks, as the most intrinsi 
cally valuable acquisition of the year in that direction. Mr. Dall 
remarks : 

This series, collected :it various times and localities, contains an unusnal number 
of fine undescribed species and numerous others new to the collection. The propor- 
tion which may be described as really valuable is unusually large. 

The accumulation of valuable specimens received singly or in small 
lots from numerous friends of the Museum deserves notice. An enu- 
meration of these will be found in Appendix ii. 

With the exception of plants, few purchases of importance were made 
for the Department during the year, but a series of rodents from Pata- 
gonia, collected by Mr. W. A. Peterson, comprising „239 specimens is 
deserving of notice. The collection of mammals is very deficient iu 
South American specimens, and this material was especially desirable. 

An extended reference to the explorations of members of the Museum 
staff will be found on page 09. Collections were made by Messrs. 
Rose and Pollard in Mexico and Florida, respectively; by Dr. Leon- 
hard Stejneger in the vicinity of the Commander Islands; by Messrs. 
Schuchert and White on the coast of Greenland, and by Mr, Robert 
Ridgway in Florida. The explorations of Mr. R. P. Currie in Liberia 
were referred to in the last Annual Report, although the larger portion 
of the material obtained was not received until after the beginning of 
the present fiscal year. 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETAKY. 39 

Some important chauges were made in the i)ersounel of the depart- 
ment during' the year. In the Division of Insects, Dr. Harrison G. Dyar 
was appointed custodian of Lepidoptera. Dr. William L. Ralph suc- 
ceeds the late Maj. Charles Bendire as custodian of the Section of 
Birds' Eggs. Mr. W. T. Swingle was appointed custodian of the Sec- 
tion of Algje and Mr. D. G. Fairchild of the Section of Lower Fungi. 
These gentlemen have rendered exceedingly valuable services in their 
several sections during the year. The department is indeed dependent 
for its successful operation at the present time very largely upon the 
gratuitous, disinterested efforts of its honorary curators and custo- 
dians, the value of whose services can not be overestimated. 

In the Division of Marine Invertebrates Miss Harriet Richardson 
and Miss Mary B. Smith served as volunteer assistants. 

The routine work of entering, classifying, and caring for the collec- 
tions in the several divisions has been carried on continuously, and it 
may be said that the condition of the collections in general is better 
than ever before. The greatest drawback has been found in the lack 
of sufficient laboratory space, the working rooms in some of the divi- 
sions being crowded to such an extent that it is almost impossible for 
the assistants to move about in them. This crowding afiects the work 
in many ways, making the arrangement of collections unavoidably 
unsystematic, to a large extent, and rendering nearly impossible those 
operations which require the use or inspection of large numbers of 
specimens at the same time. The extensive collection of mammals of 
the Department of Agriculture, including especially the large forms, 
were brought together in a part of the southeast range, which has 
been screened off for the purpose, no other space being found for this 
bulky material. This encroachment upon the exhibition space is con- 
sidered undesirable, but can not be avoided unless additions are made 
to the Museum building or a larger structure provided. A similar 
provision was made for the National Herbarium, in the Division of 
Plants, a portion of the East Hall gallery being given up for the pur- 
pose. The collection of plants has grown to great size and importance 
and has entirely overflowed the quarters assigned to it a few years since. 

In the Division of Mammals the type specimens were brought together 
and carefully labeled with special red tags where needed. They will 
be kept hereafter in special cases. The overcrowding in the upper 
laboratory was somewhat relieved by a rearrangement of specimens, 
but the case room is at present inadequate. The study series is in an 
excellent state of preservation, but much in need of a rearrangement, 
which, however, can not be accomplished until more case room is 
provided. 

In the Division of Birds Mr. Robert Ridgway, curator, reports that 
a large portion of the series, including all the water birds and waders, 
was thoroughly overhauled and rearranged in new dust tight cases, 
which have been provided lor the purpose. Some twenty families still 



40 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

require atteutiou, aud are now, for the most part, crowded into cases 
which are unsuitable and are practically inaccessible. A special effort 
has been made during the year to bring together type specimens of 
birds and to see that they were properly labeled and arranged in cases 
made for the puri)ose. 

13octor Ralph devoted a large amount of time to clearing away the 
accumulation of work in the Section of Birds' Eggs since the death of 
Major Bendire. The collection now numbers over 64,000 specimens, 
and is by far the most extensive in existence. While the eggs them- 
selves are in excellent condition, the collection of nests is only indif- 
ferently provided for, and new cases will be needed. 

As is fully recognized by the curator, the exhibition series of birds is 
by no means satisfactory. The cases in the Smithsonian building are 
old and not dust tight, and are furthermore very much crowded together, 
on which account, and because of the insufficient lighting in the hall, 
the collection can not be appreciated at its true value. As already 
stated in another part of tlie report, an attempt will probably be made 
during the coming year to remedy these defects to a certain extent, but 
the problem is a very difficult one, and it is doubtful whether the 
exhibit can be brought up entirely to modern standards without more 
expense than would be justified under present conditions. Special 
attention was given to some of the series, such as the hornbills, a very 
striking group, of which the Museum possesses a full collection. This 
series was entirely overhauled and new forms added. 

A special series arranged for children has been for some time exhib- 
ited in a small room adjacent to the main hall, and was relabeled 
throughout during the year. 

In the Division of Reptiles and Batrachians, the exhibition series 
was removed from the Smithsonian to the Museum building, as already 
stated, and rearranged to form a faunal North American series. The 
exotic mounted skins, which were indifferent in quality and insufficient 
in number and variety to form a series of any significance, were boxed 
and stored, duplicates of American species were removed, and the 
remainder arranged in systematic order. The curator. Dr. Leonhard 
Stejneger, reports the general collections as being in excellent condi 
tion, but no extensive operations were carried on, as he was necessarily 
absent a considerable i)ortion of the year in connection with his duties 
as a member of the Fur Seal Commission. 

The exhibit of the Division of Fishes at the close of the last fiscal 
year consisted of several cases of casts and a large number of alcoholic 
specimens in jars, all of which were disjdayed in one of the smaller 
halls in the Smithsonian building. For reasons previously stated, the 
casts were removed to the Museum building, where they were installed 
in the southeast range in cases more suitable, and in such manner that 
the characteristics of the American fauna could be appreciated at a 
glance. The large collection of alcoholics was withdrawn from exhibi- 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 41 

tion, it haviug" beeu shown that they could scarcely be made interesting 
or instructive to the public. A place was found for them in the labora- 
tory, which for some time had been occupied by mammals, a change 
which has the advantage of allowing them to be protected from the 
light and make them accessible to students without intruding upon 
the public. Type specimens were placed in special cases and guarded 
from the light, which causes deterioration. 

The cases formerly used for the exhibition of fishes being old and of 
a pattern not now considered suitable for such purposes, they were 
removed to the laboratory and there made use of for the better arrange- 
ment of the general study series. 

Mr. William H. Dall, curator of the Division of Mollusks, reports 
the great collections of that division in good condition, but calls atten- 
tion to the inconvenien(-e arising from overcrowding, which increases 
year by year. A very large amount of material, comprising no less than 
3,500 species of shells, was identified for correspondents of the Museum 
during the year. In connection with this work, however, the Museum 
receives many valuable specimens. 

There has been very great activity in the Division of Insects during 
the year, which the honorary curator. Dr. L. O. Howard, regards as a 
phenomenal one in the history of the division. He writes: 

The snrpiisiug part, however, is in the fact that the actual number of speciea and 
specimeus and their scientific value surpasses anything in the history of the division, 
since, notwithstanding the wonderful increase and value of the specimeus received 
last year, due to the extensive exotic material presented by Dr. W. L. Abbott, those 
received during the present year will moi'e than equal those received during the past 
decade. This increase is due principally to the very large and valuable collection 
of North American Coleoptera presented by Messrs. Hubbard and Schwarz, while it 
is worthy of note that the additions, without this collection would be nearly three 
times as large as those in the previous fiscal year. 

The collections are in a better state of preservation than ever before, 
and a large amount of work has been done in rearranging and classify- 
ing specimens. The material in each order has been divided according 
to continents and arranged systematically, by which plan the labor of 
identifying new material is considerably lessened. Dr. Dyar, custodian 
of Lepidoptera, has rearranged the collections of that order, adding 
many species from his private collection, and in both ways very greatly 
increasing Ihe value of the collections. This voluntary work is of much 
importance to the Museum and is highly ap])reciated. All the tyi)es and 
cotypes at present in the collection have been properly labeled during 
the year and recorded in a special catalogue. The whole number of 
these specimens is nearly 6,000. 

The chief operation of the Division of Marine Invertebrates was the 
preparation of 100 sets of duplicate specimens, designed for distribu- 
tion to high schools throughout the country. Each set contains speci- 
mens representative of about 100 species, and more than .SO, 000 
specimens are included in the entire series. About one-half of these 



42 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

sets have already been distributed. The distribution of this large 
amount of material has relieved the storerooms and cases. As already 
stated, a considerable change is contemplated in the exhibition series 
of the division, and at the close of the year work was begun by a 
readjustment of the the cases in the exhibition ball. 

The curator of the Division of Comparative Anatomy, Mr. F. A. 
Lucas, was absent a considerable portion of the year in connection 
with his duties as a member of the Fur Seal Commission. On th.it 
account, and because he is also charged with the general care of the 
vertebrate fossils, a large amount of work has not been done on the 
osteological collections. So far as the exhibition series is concerned 
this is not detrimental to the Museum, as the series is already very full 
and very carefully arranged and labeled. The condition of the reserve 
series, however, is not satisfactory, the curator reporting that more 
than double the number of drawers now in use are needed for the 
accommodation of specimens and their proper arrangement and to 
permit the withdrawal from storage of the large amount of material 
now practically inaccessible. 

In the Division of Plants Mr. F. V. Coville, honorary curator, reports 
that several important changes and improvements have taken place. 

In order to provide a circulation aisle for visitors around the East 
Hall gallery it was necessary to move the screen at the east end back 
some 4 feet into the botanical laboratory. The loss of space was com- 
pensated for by assembling a double row of cases on the south side of 
the gallery for its whole length, making in all about liOO running feet. 
Whether this arrangement can be maintained permanently is perhaps 
doubtful. 

Two rooms in the east tower were fitted up for the collection of 
cryptogamic plants, which, however, is likely to soon outgrow these 
quarters. 

The sectional herbarium, numbering some 30,000 specimens, which 
was formerly kept in the Section of Paleobotany, was returned to the 
general collection, and the work of distributing the specimens to their 
proper places has progressed satisfactorily during the ^ear. 

The separation and marking of type specimens has been continued. 
During the year 252 such specimens were marked, making a total thus 
far of 1,59G. 

Scientifi(; investigations of more or less wide scope have been carrie<l 
on in the several divisions of the department during the year, and the 
results obtained are very creditable to the statt". Mr. Robert Iiidgwii> 
has made satisfactory progress on the comprehensive manual of North 
and Middle American birds, which he has had in preparation for a con- 
siderable time. The head curator of the department has continued 
studies on the cetaceans, and has completed a paper on the nomen- 
clature of the whalebone whales of the North Atlantic. Mr. G. S. 
Miller, Jr., has been engaged in an investigation of the Free-tailed bats. 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 43 

He has published several niiiior papers on mammals during- the year. 
Dr. T. II. Beau has continued work on the collections oflishes made by 
the Fish Commission steamer Albatross in South American waters, 
and has made investigations in the waters of New York with special 
reference to fish life. Mr. Barton A, Bean has continued investiga- 
tions on the. collections of Mexican lishes and has completed one portion 
of the work, the results of which are now in liand ibr publication. He 
also nmde a study of the fishes of Wallowa Lake, Oregon, for the U. S. 
Fish Commission, the results of which are given in a report already in 
the hands of the Commissioner. Mr. W. H. Dall has devoted consid- 
erable time to a revision of the bivalve shells in connection with his 
work on the Tertiary invertebrate fanna, and has made various minor 
investigations. The study of the fresh-water mussels has been con- 
tinued by Mr. C. II. Simpson with important results. Dr. L. O. How- 
aid has continued studies on the parasitic insects of the family Encyr- 
tiiiiie, especially those parasitic on the Ooccidic, and has completed one 
paper on that group. Mr. W. H. Ashmead has nearly completed his 
monograph of the insects of the family Braconidiie, which he has had in 
hand for several years, and has worked up four large collections of 
Hymenoptera. The collections of insects made by Messrs. Stejneger 
and Barrett-Hamilton, of the Fur Seal Commission, on the Commander 
Islands, have been worked up and reported upon by Messrs. Schwarz, 
Dyar, Coquillett, Banks, and Cook. The results will be published in 
the report of the Fur Seal Commission. Mr. Coipiillett completed his 
monograph of the Hies of the family Tachiiiida' and his revision of the 
Simulidte, and both have been published. He also worked up the 
Japanese Diptera, received from Professor Mitsukuii, and completed a 
revision of the family Scatophagidie. He has nnder hand revisions of 
the HelomyzidiB and Sapromyzida'. Prof. O. F. Cook has continued 
studies on the Myriapoda and the Orthopteran insects of the families 
Mantidie and Phasmid.e. Mr. J. B. Benedict has completed his studies 
of several groups of Isopod Crustaceans and i)ublished reports on the 
ArcturidcC and the genera Synidotea and Idotca. He has continued 
work on the Galatheid* and has in preparation a paper on the genus 
Munidopsis. Miss M. J. Kathbnn completed a paper on the Decapod 
Crustaceans of Jamaica and on the Brachyurau Crustacea collected by 
the Iowa University expedition of ISO i to the Florida Keys and Baha- 
mas. She also completed three minor papers on Crustaceans and made 
otlier studies in that group. 

Mr. J. N. Eose, assistant curator in the Division of Plants, has 
devoted a considerable ])ortion of the year to the determination of the 
botanical material colle(;ted by him in Mexico, with a view to the pub- 
lication of the results of his observations. 

The collections of the de[)artment have been made use of extensively 
by luituralists throughout the country and abroad, various series and 
single specimens being loaned, as in previous years, for investigation. 



44 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

(For a detailed list of loans see page 64.) The loans of botanical 
material liave been very nnmerous, aggregating in all abont 3,900 
specimens. Included in the records of loans are the names of the 
botanical departments of (Columbia, Cornell, and Harvard universities 
and other universities and colleges, together with botanical gardens 
and museums at home and abroad. In addition to these loans of 
specimens the collections have been studied in Washington by numer- 
ous specialists during the j^ear. The naturalists of the U. S. Fish Com- 
mission and of the Biological Survey and other bureaus of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture have of course had free access to the collections, 
and have made use ol" them to a considerable extent. 

The publications for the year (a list of which will be found in the 
Bibliography) show a gratifying activity on th'e part of the scientific 
staff of the department, and indicate also the large extent to which 
the collections are being used by naturalists generally. 

Considerable time was occupied during the year in preparations for 
an exhibit at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, at 
Omaha, Nebraska. The exhibit which was planned by the head cura- 
tor, and assembled with great success by the heads of the several divi- 
sions, consists of a representation of the aquatic faunas and marine 
plants of the United States. Ever}^ group of aiiimals inhabiting our 
waters is included, from the lowest to the highest, and an extensive 
and most excellent series of seaweeds. The large mounted birds and 
the casts of fishes and reptiles are displayed in a large wall case con- 
structed for the purpose. The remainder of the exhibit is shown in 
narrow floor cases, with full plate glass fronts. It includes some novel- 
ties, such as jelly fish preserve 1 in formalin, which have probably not 
been seen at any previous exposition. The whole series is carefully 
labeled. 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY 
FOR THE YEAR 1897-98. 

By George P. Merrill, 
Head Curator. 

The past year has been oue of great, if not unparalleled, progress in 
the department. This for the reason that under the reorganization 
which was eilf'ected early iii the year, proper coordination of the various 
divisions was for the lirst time rendered j)ossible. 

Owing to the suspension of work of all kinds in the exhibition halls 
during the construction of the new galleries and exhibition cases, 
together with the prolonged absence of the head curator in Europe, it 
is true, however, that but little of this progress is as yet evident to the 
public. 

Since actively assuming charge of the department, early in ]S"ovem- 
ber, the head curator has devoted much time to going over the written 
and j)rinted records of the various United States exploring expeditious 
and surveys with a view to ascertaining what geological materials had 
been collected which could be properly considered the propert}'^ of the 
Government, and what disposition had been made of the same. This 
has resulted in bringing together some of the scattered materials 
which had been loaned in years past for study purposes, or which had 
never been turned over to the custody of the Museum. Moreover, so 
soon as it became apparent that the department was ready and more 
than willing to take charge of the materials, Prof. O. C. Marsh 
announced his readiness to turn over the large series of vertebrate 
fossils collected under his direction during his connection with the 
U. S. Geological Survey under J, W. Powell. Mr. Lucas, the acting 
assistant curator of the Division of Vertebrate Paleontology, spent 
four weeks, with proper assistance, at New Haven in May and June of 
this year, with the result that two carloads of these fossils, comprising 
many specimens of Triccratops, besides Dinoceras, Ulotheriuw, and 
other Miocene forms, have already been received. 

Arrangements have been made, through the administrator of the 
estate of the late E. D. Cope, for the return to the Museum of the 
extensive series of Eocene fishes, collected principally during the years 
1872-73 in Utah and Wyoming, and retained by Professor Cope for 
study. It is confidently expected that these will roach the Museum 
even before this rei^ort appears in print. 

In addition to the collection of vertebrate fossils already noted, the 
division has obtained, through purchase, a valuable collection of Mosa- 

45 



46 REPORT OP^ NATIONAL ' MUSEUM, 1898. 

saurs from the Oretaceovisof western Kansas, two collections of Elasmo- 
brancli teeth and spines from the Carboniferous of Iowa, and an 
unusually fine skull and fore-limb bones of Glaosaurus. 

Through the TJ. S. Geological Survey was obtained a small collection 
of vertebrates, including a new species of Dinictis and a Suilline from 
the Miocene of Dakota. 

The Section of Invertebrate Paleontology has likewise been greatly 
enriched, the two most imijortant accessions being gifts. Through the 
bequest of the late Mr. I. H. Harris the Museum has come into the 
possession of his private collection of over 20,000 specimens of fossils. 
Tbis is one of the finest collections ever made from the rocks of the 
Cincinnati group, and is particularly rich in starfishes, criiioids, and 
trilobites, and, moreover, contains a number of original types. 

Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of Pittston, Pennsylvania, to whom the Museum is 
already so largely indebted, has presented his extensive collection of 
fossil insects. This comprises upwards of 4,040 specimens, of which 
more than 200 are types. In addition, he also presented 97 other inver- 
tebrate fossils, 408 vertebrate fossils, and added 132 specimens to his 
series of fossil plants. Prom the U. S. Geological Survey was received 
a series of over GOO specimens of Kiiiderhook crinoids, corals, and mol- 
lusca, and 450 crinoids from the Burlington group in Iowa. In addition, 
Messrs. Schuchert and White, of the Museum and Survey, made a 
valuable collection representing the flora of the various Cretaceous and 
Tertiarj^ horizons of North Greenland. Other valuable materials, 
including an excellent Placenticeras, 22 inches in diameter, from Dakota, 
were obtained either by purchase or otherwise. 

The Division of Mineralogy has materially benefited during the year 
through the acquisition of much new material, including several new 
and rare s])ecies. 

The Division of Physical and Chemical Geology re})orts the acquisi- 
tion of a large cluster of basaltic columns from near Bonn, Prussia; 
some large masses of a beautiful orbicular granite from Sweden; ful- 
gurites on andesite from Little Ararat in Armenia, besides a large 
amount of petrographic material from the TJ. S. Geological Survey and 
other sources. The Economic Series have been enriched through the 
acquisition of some beautiful clear masses of rock salt from Heilbron, 
Prussia, collected by the head curator ; kaolins and clays from Germany 
and Saxony; an excellent series of telluride ores from the Cripple 
Creek district, Colorado, and other materials which need not be men- 
tioned in detail here. 

Aside from what has been accomplished in the Division of Mineralogy, 
but little progress has been made in the work of installing the exhibi- 
tion series. This is for the reason that the erection of the new galleries 
in the exhibition halls of the Divisions of Paleontology and Economic 
Geology, was not completed in season for more than a beginning to be 
made. Indeed, the new cases in the paleontological halls are not yet 
in readiness. Moreover, for a period of several weeks the energies of

nearly every curator and those of his assistants were fully occui)ie(l in 
the work of preparation for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. The 
details of this work have been the subject of a special report, and need 
not be repeated here. 

Mr. Lucas reports that in the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology 
a large amount of preparatory work has been done incidental to 
strengthening, restoring, and ])reparing for exhibition the skeleton of 
Zeuglodon. Two skulls of Oreodon, and one of MesoMppus from the 
Evans collection have been cleaned, a fine skull of Claosaurus and the 
upper ])ortioii of a nuignificent Triceratops nearly pre])ared for exhibi- 
tion, and smaller skulls and parts of skeletons whollj^ or partially pre- 
pared for exhibition or study. Work of this nature is extremely slow 
and laborious, and additional preparators are sadly needed. When it 
is remembered that, excepting when aided by Mr. Schuchert and others 
in the Section of Invertebrate Paleontology, the entire work of this 
division has thus far been carried on by Mr. Lucas, with the assistance 
of one clerk and one prepara.tor, it will be recognized at once that 
surprising progress has been made. 

The prolonged absence of Mr. Schuchert, incidental to the purchase 
of materials for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, and a subsetjueut 
trip into Missouri, together with his Greenland trip earlier in the 
season, has necessarily greatly retarded his work. Satisfactory prog- 
ress has been made in installing the study series and in the prepa- 
ration of exhibition material, though this, too, is delayed, owing to the 
condition of cases and exhibition halls. Practically nothing has been 
accomplished with the paleobotanical series. It is expected that the 
appointment of an assistant in charge of this collection, and the com- 
pletion of the galleries and cases, will enable me to report more satis 
factory ])rogress another year. Up to this time all Museum work done 
on these collections has been voluntary by members of the paleobotanical 
staff of the Geological Survey, or by Mr. Schuchert and his assistants, 
whose time was already more than occupied by the work of their own 
division. 

In the Division of Mineralogy Ihave to report satisfactory progress 
in the installation of the exhibition series. The Systematic Series, the 
collection of meteorites, and several special series are now, for the first 
time, satisfactorily installed, and Mr. Tassin, who has had immediate 
charge of the work, is entitled to much credit, not merely for his energy 
and industry, but as well for the taste he has manifested in the selection 
and display of the material. 

Much work yet remains to be done in the way of supplying deficien- 
cies and labeling, but it is not too much to say that the collections as 
a whole are in excellent condition. 

In the Division of Physical and Chemical Geology (systematic and 
applied) of which the head curator has immediate charge, no progress 
whatever has been made with the exhibition series until within a 



48 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. ^ 

I)eri()d of some two weeks, owiug to the delay in the completion of 
the gallery cases and Mr. Newhall's absence in Nashville and Omaha. 
The work is now progressing satisfactorily. 

An immense amount of detailed work has been accomplished in over- 
hauling and classifying collections stored in boxes and drawers, but 
much yet remains to be done. 

Scarcely any investigations of note have been undertaken by any of 
the curators, owing to the pressure of other matters and the unsatisfac- 
tory condition of the exhibition halls. The head curator was himself 
absent in Europe during the first five months of the year, attendant 
upon the meetings and excursions of the Seventh International Geo- 
logical Congress, and engaged in a study of European museums. Mr. 
Lucas has nearly completed his work on the Fossil Bison of North 
America, and Messrs. Charles Schuchert and David White have made 
a preliminary study of the fossils collected by them in Greenland dur- 
ing the summer of 1897. Their results are now in press. 

With the exception of the collections made by Messrs. Schuchert 
and White in Greenland and the necessarily limited amount of mate- 
rial brought back by the head curator from Russia, scarcely anything 
has been done toward the enrichment of the collections through the 
direct efforts of Museum officials. The collections made by the V. S. 
Geological Survey and obtained by gift, purchase, and exchange have 
been already referred to. 

The usual custom of loaning collections for study has been adhered 
to. Two small lots of vertebrate materials were loaned during the 
year, the one to Prof. H. L. Osborn, of New York, and the other to Dr. 
C. R. Eastman, of Cambridge. Dr. J. F. Whiteaves, of Ottawa, Canada, 
was in like manner loaned a collection of Hamilton fossils, and Dr. 
George H. Girty, of the U. S. Geological Survey, has had the loan of a 
collection of English Carboniferous pelecypods for comparison with 
American species. A collection of thin sections of roofing slates was 
loaned Prof. T. Nelson Dale, of Williamstown, Massachusetts, and the 
U. S. Geological Survey has on sundry occasions been granted the 
usual courtesies. 

The condition of the laboratories and exhibition halls has been such 
as to afford little encouragement to students and investigators. Prof. 
O. P. Hay has studied the large Cretaceous fishes from Kansas, with a 
view to deciding certain points in the structure of the skull and verte 
bral column, and also to ascertain whether or not the genus Portheii.s is 
synonymous with Xiphactinas. Several new points on the structure 
and afllnities were ascertained and the conclusion reached that Xiphac- 
tinas Leidy, was identical with Foriheus Cope. Similar results were 
reached independently by Albaii Stewart, of Lawrence, Kansas. Prof. 
Henry F. Osborn has likewise studied the type of such species of Cory- 
phodon as are represented in the collections. 

Aside from the studies of members of the U. S. Geological Survey. 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 49 

110 investigations of note liave been carried on in the Mnsenin by otlier 
than its ot'licers, either in the sections of Invertebrate Paleontology 
or J'aleobotany. In the J3i vision of Physical and Chemical Geology, 
Mr. Thomas L. Watson, now of the State survey of Georgia, and 
Dr. E. C. E. Lord have each spent several months, the one conducting 
investigations relative to the weathering of basic eruptive rocks and 
the other working on the rocks collected by Dr. Edgar A. IMearus 
along the line of the Mexican Boundary Survey, and a series of 
eruptive rocks from Casco Bay, Maine, 

The reasons already enumerated have necessarily cut down the num- 
ber of papers that might otherwise have been published by the curators. 
Such as have appeared are sufficiently noted in the Bibliography. 

The rapid accumulation of materials, and particularly large materials 
like vertebrate fossils, bids fair to tax to the utmost our resources for 
handling, preparation, and proper care. When it is recalled that the 
jireparation of a single skull may require the services of a skilled 
preparator for months, it will be seen at once that our i^resent force is 
quite inadequate. .Moreover, work and storage rooms are pitifully 
cramped. When further, one recalls the strikingly interesting char- 
acter of the display that is possible with this class of material, as well 
as its great value from a purely scientific standpoint, the desirability 
of pushing the work with all possible vigor becomes at once apparent, 
and I feel that I can not too strongly urge the granting of additional 
funds for the purpose. 

The work of rearranging the collections in physical geology, involv- 
ing the actual moving of upward of 100,000 specimens, labeling, num- 
bering, and bringing the card catalogue up to date, will consume a very 
large portion of the coming year. 

The same may be said regarding work in the sections of Inverte- 
brate Paleontology and Paleobotany. There are at present not I'ar 
from 1,000 boxes of fossil materials of all kinds in storage, which must 
be overhauled, identified, duplicates assorted for exchange and distri- 
bution, worthless portions rejected, and the remainder made available 
foy study and exhibition. 

The amount of detailed labor essential to the proper care of the col- 
lections can be appreciated only by those who have had experience. 
This applies to other departments than my own. 

Notwithstanding the fact that we are for the time being overbur- 
dened with materials, no opportunity should be lost for securing more, 
even though the same may remain years in storage. It is too mut'Ji to 
expect that the present favorable conditions for collecting will always' 
exist. Every reported discovery of interesting material, by members 
of the U. S. Geological Survey, or other i)arties, should be investi- 
gated, and where the character of the material warrants, immediate 
steps should be taken toward its procurement by purchase or other- 
wise. It must be borne always in mind that delays in these matters 
NAT MUS 98 4 



50 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898, 

result disastrously. This is particularly true regarding vertebrate 
remains wliicli, once exposed, become quickly ruined, unless promptly 
and properly cared for, and inexperienced collectors often do more 
harm than good. Moreover, other institutions, both American and 
foreign, are ever on the alert to obtain that to which we naturally feel 
the National Museum is best entitled. 

I can not refrain, in conclusion, from stating that too much praise 
can scarcely be awarded the individual curators and their assistants 
for the untiring energy and patience manifested, and then- willingness 
always to lay aside individual desires and preferences for the welfare 
of the department as a whole. But for this, the work of the head 
curator would be disheartening in the extreme.

APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPENDITURES. 

The amount ap])ropriated for the National Museum for the current 
fiscal year was $233,000. The total expenditures under this appropria- 
tion aggregated •$227,473.54, leaving a gross balance of $r),o2(>.4(). From 
the approi)riations for the previous fiscal year expenditures to the amount 
of $10,492.95 were made, leaving a balance (subject to liabilities) of 
$391.76.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



The appropriations for the fiscal year just euded were $25,275 in 
excess of those for the preceding year, there being an increase of $6,775 
in the amount appropriated for the preservation of collections, an 
increase of $1,000 for heating and lighting, an increase of $15,000 in 
the amount allotted for furniture and fixtures (to be used for the con- 
struction of cases, etc., for the new galleries), and an appropriation of 
$2,500 for removing and rebuilding storage sheds. It may be remarked 
that the amount allotted for the preservation of collections fell short 
of the estimate to the extent of $20,000, and that the appropriation for 
heating and lighting was $1,000 below the estimate; also that the sum 
asked for to be used in repairs to buildings was cut down one-half, the 
amount provided being only $4,000. The sum of $18,000 was requested 
for printing and binding, but only $12,000 was appropriated.

The unexpended balances of appropriations for the fiscal year 1895-96 
remain the same as at the close of the last fiscal year, and are as fol- 
lows: Preservation of collections, $1.32; furniture and fixtures, $0.20; 
heating and lighting, $0.42; building repairs, $1.38. No further claims 
having been i)resented against these appropriations, the balances will 
revert into the Treasury, to be carried to the credit of the surplus fund, 
under the provisions of section 3090 of the Kevised Statutes. 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. f)3 

The following statement concerning the estimates for iippiopriations 
for tlie fiscal year ending Juue 30, 181>9, is quoted from the report of the 
acting chief clerk, Mr. J. L. Willige: 

In October estimates were prepared of tlie appropriations required for the main- 
tenance of the National Museum during the iiscal year ending .June 30, 1899. In 
addition to the regular appropriations for furniture and fixtures, heating and light- 
ing, preservation aud increase of collections, building repairs, rent of worlcshops, 
postage, and printing and binding, the following special appropriations were 
requested: For illustrations for Museum publications, $r),000; for the purchase of 
books, pamphlets, aud periodicals for reference, $2,000; for the continuation of the 
construction of galleries in the Museum building, the building of skylights in the 
four courts, and the erection of a ventilator upon the roof of the lecture hall, $10,000 ; 
for the erection of a lireproof building for workshop and storage purposes, $50,000; 
for the purchase of the herbarium of the late M. S. Bebb, of Rockford, Illinois, 
$5,000; for the purchase of the library of the late G. Brown Goode, $5,000. 
* An increase of $20,000 was requested in the estimates for the coming fiscal year 
for the preservation, exhibition, aud increase of the Museum collections. The 
importance of the grant of this additional sum for the purpose of developing the 
Department of Geology aud expanding it in the direction of a musevim of practical 
geology and to enable substantial increases to be made in the compensation of the 
higher grades of assistants in the Museum was strongly urged upon Congress. 

The latest conference report on the sundry civil bill states the item at $165,000, an 
increase of $5,000 over the appropriation for 1898. 

In the estimates for appropriatious for the coming fiscal year is an item of $15,000 
for heating and lighting, being $1,000 in excess of the current appropriation. 

In view of the considerable sum of money paid from year to year by the Museum 
for the preparation of drawings for use in the Museum publications, it was endeav- 
ored to have a specific appropriation of $5,000 provided for the purpose. It was 
explained that this item of expenditure is an important one in carrying out the 
policy of disseminating information regarding the Government collections among 
educational institutions throughout the country, and the hope expressed that it 
would not be necessary to continue the cost of illustrations as a charge upon the 
appropriation for the preservatiou, exhibition, aud increase of the Museum collec- 
tions. The sundry civil bill, while not, however, containing a specific appropriation 
for drawings, authorizes the expenditure for this purpose, from the preservation of 
collections appropriation, of a sum not exceeding $5,500. 

In the estimates submitted to Congress for the coming fiscal year is an item of 
$17,000 for printing the Bulletins and Proceedings and labels and blanks for the 
National ^luseum, aud binding books aud pamphlets for the Museum library. It is 
urged that the entire sum asked be appropriated, in order that an edition of the 
Museum publications large enough to supply the principal scientific and educational 
establishments may be assured. 

The sundry civil bill had not become a law at the close of the fiscal 
year, but the aj^propriations for the year ending June 30, 1899, as 
agreed to by the conferees of the Senate and House of Eei)resentatives 
are as follows : ^ 

Furniture aud fixtures (including $20,000 for furnishing new galleries) $35, 000 

Heating and lighting 14, 000 

Preservatiou of collections • 165, 000 

Purchase of books of reference 2, 000 

Building repairs 4, 000 

' The sundry civil bill, as finally passed, carried the appropriations indicated.

BUILDINGS. 

In the acts of Congress approved June 11, 1896, and June 4, 1897, 
provision was made for tlie erection of iron galleries in the Museum 
building. Under these appropriations, amounting altogether to $10,000, 
galleries have been erected in the four courts and in three of the halls 
of the building, thus increasing the exhibition space by 17,000 square 
feet. 

During the fiscal year just clo.sed the work of constructing the gal- 
leries has been under the direction of the Superintendent of the Library 
of Congress. 

In the estimates submitted to Congress for appropriations for the 
coming fiscal year the sum of $10,000 was asked for, to be used in 
erecting galleries connecting the courts with the adjoining halls, sup- 
plying railings, painting the ironwork about the galleries, and placing 
skylights above the courts. This item is included in the sundry civil 
bill as passed by both Houses of Congress and sent to the President 
for approval. 

It was requested in the estimates for 1898-99 that provision be made 
for the construction of a special building adapted for workshops and 
for storage i)urposes. A preliminary plan for a building 50 feet front 
by 130 feet deep, to be entirely fireproof in its construction and corre- 
sponding in its materials and workmanship with the Museum building, 
was prejiared and submitted. The cost of the proposed building was 
estimated at $50,000. The Government reservation between the 
National and Army Medical museums, with frontage on B street south, 
was suggested as an advantageous site for the building. The proposi-- 
tion was not favorably acted upon by Congress, but, in addition to the 
$2,000 customarily granted for the rental of a building for storage pur- 
poses, the sum of $2,500 was appropriated for the rental of additional 
quarters in which to place the carpenter and cabinet shops and for the 
storage of the material contained in the wooden shops near the Fish 
Commission building. 

The storage sheds south of the Smithsonian buildings were removed 
during the year. They had long been regarded as a source of danger 
to the main building in case of fire. Some sections of the sheds were 
removed to the yard of the storage building on Kinth street. The 
remaining serviceable material was used in the erection of a two-story 
workshop. 

The wooden floors in two of the ranges were taken up and substan- 
tial concrete floors laid in their stead. Mahogany wall cases and 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 5") 

screens liave been constructed and placed in position on several of the 
galleries. 

In order to accommodate additional tioor cases, the steam radiators 
in some of the exhibition halls have been raised to a convenient height 
and attached to the piers. Improvements in the water-supply system 
have also been made. 

The walls in many of the halls and ranges and in two of the courts 
were painted during- the year. 

ACCESSIONS AND REGISTRATION. 

The amount of material received during the year was unusually large, 
aggregating 457,090 specimens. These were embraced in 1,441 sei)- 
arate accession lots. In the division of insects alone 22(),0()0 specimens 
were received, due to the acquisition of the Hubbard and Schwarz 
collection, which is specially referred to elsewhere. Large quantities of 
material were received by the Division of Molluslis and the Division 
of Paleontology, and there have been notable increases in the collec- 
tions of the divisions of prehistoric arclncology, mammals, birds, and 
plants. The following tables show the number of specimens added to 
the various collections during the year and the total number of speci-

increase of 79 over the record for the previous year), 1,724 contained 
supplies of various kinds for use in the offices and shops of the Museum, 
and 11,522 consisted of publications. Three thousand and seventy- 
three packages were sent out. 

The entries on the outgoing transportation record numbered 1,482 
and on the incoming transportation record 3,137. 

Seven carloads of material were shipped to the Trans- Mississippi and 
International Exposition at Omaha. 

Two hundred and twenty-one packages were placed in storage and 
57 were withdrawn. 



DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANaES. 

Thirty-two thousand three hundred and sixty-three specimens were 
sent out as gifts or in exchange, and 7,4G1 specimens were lent for 
study during the year. A number of sets of marine invertebrates 
have been prepared with a special view to supplying the needs of 
schools, and these have been distributed to the number of about 17,000 
specimens. Many collections of rocks and ores and casts of prehistoric 
implements were also presented to educational establishments. 

A complete list of the distributions of the year is printed in Appen-

Several exchanges have been conducted with institutions and indi- 
viduals in foreign countries, resulting in the acquisition of some valua- 
ble material. 

It is questionable whether this branch of the Museum work is. taken 
as a whole year by year, very i)rofitable. It is difficult to arrange satis- 
factorily the details of an exchange with an establishment several thou- 
sands of miles away. The necessity of determining one uncertain point 
may cause a delay of several months, during which tiu)e other oi)por- 
tunities for utilizing the material intended for exchange may have 
arisen. Valuations placed on specimens vary, and what may seem to 
us a generous offer on our part may be regarded as far from being an 
equivalent to the other party. In certain cases it is impossible to fur- 
nish first class specimens, and the failure to do so, altliough explana- 
tion may have been made in the correspondence leading to the exchange, 
has not unfrequently i^laced this Museum in an undesirable and unde- 
served position. Furthermore, it seldom happens that the ^establish- 
ment with which an exchange is being conducted is willing to part 
with its best material, especially if sending first. Specimens which 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 59 

were iu good coiKlition when sliipped often deteriorate before reaching 
their destination, and this again furnishes ground for dissatisfaction. 

It is not likely, however, that transactions with establishments and 
individuals wlio have been exchanging material with this Museum, to 
the satisfaction of both, will be discontinued, altliough it is doubtful 
whether special pains will be taken to extend negotiations of this 
character into untried fields. 

A number of exchanges which have been pending for special reasons 
were completed during the year just closed. Among the most important 
transactions the following may be mentioned : 

From the Imperial Royal Natural History Museum, Vienna, Austria, 
6G specimens of Tertiary corals were received in exchange for Lower 
Cretaceous fossils. The Paleontological Museum of the Royal Acad- 
emy, Munich, Bavaria, received from the TT. S. National Museum 16 
specimens of Cambrian fossils, in exchange for material sent some time 
ago. Thirty-three specimens of fossil plants, representing 20 species, 
were received from the Natural History Society of New Brunswick, 
St. John, and ItO specimens of fossil plants have been sent in return. 
The Branicki Museum, Warsaw, Russia, has received 170 bird skins 
from the National Museum, in continuation of exchanges. Land shells 
from Transcaspia and the Caucasus and marine shells from the coast of 
Russia have been received from the Zoological Museum of the Imperial 
Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, in exchange for about 2,000 
specimens of shells from the National Museum. Mons. M. Cossmann, 
Paris, France, sent a collection of shells in exchange for publications. 
Sixty-two specimens of Actinians have been transmitted to the Royal 
Museum of Natural History, Stockholm, Sweden, in exchange for 
material yet to be forwarded. Crustaceans have been sent to the 
Museum of Natural History, Geneva, Switzerland, in return for speci- 
mens already received and in continuation of exchanges. 

Mr. T. AVayland Vaughan, of the U. S. Geological Survey, was author- 
ized to arrange exchanges with several foreign museums during his 
visit to Eurolje in the summer of 1897. He made an especial effort to 
obtain corals from the Cretaceous and Tertiary formations of Europe. 
Series of specimens have already been received from the Geological- 
Paleontological Institute, Munich, Bavaria, and the Geological Society 
of London; also from the Imperial Royal Natural History Museum, 
Vienna, as stated above. 

LABELS. 

Ninety-eight requisitions were received from the various divisions of 
the Museum during the year. Twelve of these were sent to the Gov- 
ernment Printing Office to be filled, namely, requisitions for binding 
482 books; for printing 3,958 labels, representing 197 forms, for print- 
ing 700 specifications for supplies; for binding 13 volumes of vouchers; 
for 500 manila pads, and 9 record books. There were printed at the 
Museum 209,205 labels (representing 6,640 forms), of which 48,998 (rep- 
resenting 3,902 forms) were for use in connection with the Trans-

Mississippi and International Exposition. More than 160,000 letter 
beads, envelopes, circnlars, blanks, etc., representing 68 forms, were 
also printed. 

VISITORS. 

There were 276,527 visitors to the Smithsonian and Museum build- 
ings during the year. The following tables show respectively the num-

STUDENTS AND INVESTIGATORS. 

During the year covered by this report the following persons luive 
been accorded access to the collections in the Mnseam: 

Mr. E. W. Kelson, of the Department of Agriculture, has spent much 
time in the study of Eskimo collections and has completed a mono- 
graph on the subject. Mr. P. C. Boyle, of Oil City, Pennsylvania, 
studied the collection of lamj)s and illuminating devices. Mr. Stewart 
Oulin, Director of the Museum of Archaeology and Palaeontology, Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania, has had access to the collections of games 
in connection with the preparation of a paper. Mr. J. D. McGuire, 
of Ellicott City, Maryland, has continued his work upon the pipes of 
the American aborigines. The results of his investigations have been 
embodied in a paper which will appear in the Report of the Museum 
for 1897 (now in press). Major J. W. Powell, Director of the Bureau 
of American Ethnology, examined the pipes collected by himself iu 
Utah many years ago. Dr. J. Walter Fewkes has prosecuted investi- 
gations upon the material which he recently collected in the Southwest, 
and has prepared a report upon his explorations during 1897-98. In 
the Division of Historic Archwlogy information has been given to the 
following: Mr. Richard Fisher, San Antonio, Texas; Mr. F. W. Hodge, 
Bureau of Ethnology; Hon. Oscar Straus, Mr. George W. Moon, Lon- 
don, England; and Prof. H. Hyvernat, of the Catholic University, 
Washington. 

Prof. James Hine, of the Ohio State University, consulted the Museum 
collection of Neuroptera. Mr. Arthur C. Bradley, of Newport, New 
Hampshire, examined the Noctuid.e for the purpose of identitying 
specimens collected in New Hampshire. Mr. Nathan Banks, of the 
Department of Agriculture, has frequently examined the Arachnida 
and allied classes for purposes of study and identification. Prof. 
Roland Thaxter, of Harvard University, spent several days during 
March examining the collection of Coleoptera for minute fungi found 
growing on their elytra. He secured some very rare si)ecies from tlie 
exotic beetles. Professor Thaxter is engaged in monographing this 
group of fungi (the Tjaboulbeniaceiie). Mrs. Annie T. Slosson and Doctor 
Prime, of Franconia, New Hampshire; Mr. O. W. Barrett, of Claren- 
don, Vermont; Dr. J. W. Holland, of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania; Dr. H. 
G. Griffith and Mr. WiHiam J. Fox, of Philadelphia; Prof. F. M. Web-

in the Division of Insects during the year. 

Mr. E. W. Nelson, Dei)artment of Agriculture, spent three months 
or more studying the Mnseum collection of Mexican birds in connec- 
tion with the determination ol the material collected by him in Mex- 
ico for the Biological Survey. Mr. H. C. Oberholser, Department 
of Agricultnre, studied the Horned Larks, with a view to revising 
the group; the forms of Thryot horns bewicki, with a view to the prep- 



62 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

aration of a revision of the group; tlie series of Amazilia cervini- 
ventrisjin order to determiue the distribution of a new form; the series 
of 3Iegascops Jiammeolus, for the purpose of determining the forms 
embraced under that name; also two small collections of birds from 
West Africa. Dr. A. K. Fisher, Department of Agriculture, examined 
the collection at various times in connection with his determination 
of certain type specimens and the identification of matei-ial for the Bio- 
logical Survey. Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston, Massachusetts, made 
use of the Museum collection in identifying a series of 700 birds from 
the Santa Marta region of Colombia. Mr. J. W. Garrett, of Baltimore, 
Maryland, consulted the library preparatory to identifying a collection 
of Patagouian birds. Mr. F. M. Chapman, of the American Museum of 
Natural History, New York, studied the petrels, in order to determine 
the validity of a Pacific coast form. Mrs. George C. Maynard and Miss 
Florence Merriam, both of Washington, examined certain North Amer- 
ican birds, for the i^urpose of describing them in ])opular works on birds. 
Miss Jennie E. Letson, of Buffalo, New Yoi^, devoted considerable 
time to the study of mollusks. Mr. Outram Bangs spent a few days in 
March, and again in May, making comparisons of North American 
species of mammals. Professor Mitsukuri, of the University of Tokyo, 
studied the collection of seals, in order to familiarize himself with their 
taxonomic character. Mr. E. W. Nelson, of the Department of Agricul 
ture, was given facilities for an extended study of the squirrels of 
Mexico and Central America. Mr. George R. Wieland, State College, 
Pennsylvania^ examined specimens of marine and fresh-water turtles. 
Dr. David S. Jordan, president of the Leland Stanford Junior Univer 
sity, examined fishes in connection with a report upon the investiga- 
tions of the Fur Seal Commission, and in connection also with the prep- 
aration of additional volumes of the work on the "Fishes of North 
and Middle America."^ Dr. B. W. P^vermann, who is associated with 
Doctor Jordan as joint author of the above work, also made frequent 
use of the collections. Dr. H. M. Smith and Dr. W. C. Kendall, ol the 
U. S. Fish Commission, compared specimens of fishes in the collection 
with others recently obtained by the Commission. 

Miss Harriet Richardson made a study of certain groups of Isopoda, 
including species of the genera Bocinela and ^'Ega, and is preparing an 
annotated list of the Isopoda of the west coast of North America. In 
November Prof. K. Mitsnkuri, of the University of Tokyo, spent about 
a week at the Museum studying the Holothuroidea obtained during 
the cruise of the Albatross- to the Galapagos Islands in 1891. In 
February, Mr. K. Kishinonye, of Tokyo, was engaged for two weeks 
in studying the Medusae and the Pena'ida'. Since early in May Dr. 
Charles M. Blackford, jr., of the Medical College of Georgia, has been 
engaged in studying the Protozoa and other low forms of life.

City, spent a few days at the Herbarium in individual work on the 
Asclepiadacere, which she is engaged in monographing. Dr. John K. 
Small, curator of the Herbarium of Columbia University, iS^ew York 
City, consulted the Herbarium frequently during a short visit to Wash- 
ington in August, and in connection with his work he greatly assisted 
the Museum by making a number of critical determinations. Mr. C. H. 
Thompson, of the Missouri Botanical Gardens, St. Louis, was engaged 
for a few days in the study of Lemnaceie. Prof. L. M. Underwood, 
Columbia University, i^ew York, visited the Herbarium in November 
and studied the Pteridophyta. Prof. E. L. Greene, of the Catholic 
University, Washington, frequently consulted the collection. He has 
made many valuable suggestions, and has generously placed his library 
at the disposal of members of the Museum staff. Through the oppor- 
tunity thus afforded of studying certain works not to be found elsewhere 
in the city, the members of the staff have been materially aided in 
certain lines of investigation. Mr. William Canby, of Wilmington, 
Delaware, made several visits to the Herbarium, and has contributed 
some valuable plants. Mr. Canby has long been a correspondent of 
the Museum, and has added many rare plants to the collection. Mr. 
Hermann von Schrenk, of the Missouri P>otanical Gardens, spent a 
short time at the Herbarium in June. Prof. F. A. Waugh, of the 
University of Vermont, examined certain specimens. Professor Euth 
of the -University of Tennessee inspected the arrangements in the 
Herbarium. 

In the Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology many visitors have 
requested the privilege of examining specimens, and their wishes have 
been arceded to whenever practicable. Dr. E. C. E. Lord, of the U. S. 
Geological Survey, and Dr. Thomas L. Watson, of Cornell University, 
Ithaca, New York, studied the collections in the Division of Geology. 
Prof. O. P. Hay has examined the large Cretaceous fishes from Kan- 
sas with a view to deciding certain points in the structure of the 
skull and vertebral column, and also to ascertain whether or not the 
genus Porthens is synonymous with Xiphactinas.. Several new points 
in the structure and affinities of XiphactUias were ascertained and the 
conclusion reached that XipJiactinas Leidy was identical with rorthcus 
Cope, the latter name being a synonym. Prof. Henry F. Osborn 
studied the types of such species of Coryphodon as are contained in the 
collections, with the intention of making a revision of the si)ecies of 
that genus. 

On January 7, 18!)8, Miss Mary Bartlett Smith was given ])ermission 
to serve as volunteer assistant in the Division of Marine Invertebrates. 

The privilege granted to visitors to the Smithsonian and Museum 
buildings of photographing and sketching objects in the exhibition 
halls has been availed of by a large number of persons. Many classes 
from the public and i)rivate schools of Washington visited the Museum 



64 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

during the year, and pupils from a number of schools outside of Wash- 
ington also inspected the collections. 

It may be stated here that permission can not be granted to photo- 
graph objects on deposit and not the property of the Museum, until the 
written consent of the owners has been obtained, nor can prints from 
Museum negatives be furnished in such cases without the consent of 
the owners. 

Material has been sent out for examination as follows: 

Objects of pottery, jade and serpentine axes and ornaments, ceremo- 
nial axes, banner stones, and drilled and figured tablets were sent to 
Mr. F. H. Cushing, Bureau of Ethnology. Bone gaming implements 
were transmitted to Mr. Stewart Culin, of the University of Pennsyl- 
vania, for use in the preparation of a paper on games. A collection of 
games from the Philippine Islands was also sent. A series of Ute pipes 
was lent to Maj. J. W. Powell, Director of the Bureau of Ethnology. 

From the Division of Fishes the following material has been sent 
out for study : To Dr. D. S. Jordan, Leland Stanford Junior University, 
California, specimens of Sehastes marinns, Sehastolohus alascanvs^ certain 
species of the genera Zeus, Chcetodon, Holocentrtis, and AmmodyteSy and 
a small collection of fishes made near the Commander Islands in 1897, 
by Dr. Leonhard Stejneger; to the Museum of Comparative Zoology, 
Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the request of Professor Carman, two 
specimens of Phycis regius; to Dr. T. H. Bean, specimens of Pantosteiis 
plebeius; to Dr. C. H. Eigenmann, Indiana University, Indianapolis, 
Indiana, specimens for study in the preparation of a review of the blind 
fishes; to S. Watase, Chicago, specimens of phosphorescent fishes, for 
study in connection with the preparation of a paper upon tlie phos- 
phorescent organs of animals. 

Frequent use of the collection in the Division of Mammals has been 
made by specialists of the Department of Agriculture, and a number 
of specimens were borrowed, including types of Reithrodon montanus, 
Perognathiis monticola, P. californicus, Microtus edax, M. caUfornicns, 
Peromyscus hoyli 'penicillatus, Hesperomys melanophrys, Perognathus 
penicillatus, and P. spinatus. There were sent to Mr. Outram Bangs, 
Boston, Massachusetts, 5 skulls of certaiu species of Putorius and 5 
Skulls of species of Prethizon; to Mr. S. IS". Ehoads, Academy of Nat- 
ural Sciences, 7 skulls of mammals; to R. Lydekker, Ilarpenden,

genus, and plates of DinicMhys pustulosus were lent to Dr. C. R. East- 
man of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cam bridj>e, Massachusetts. 
English Carboniferous i>elecypods were sent to Dr. G. H. Girty of the 
U. S. Geological Survey. A collection of thin sections of slates was 
lent to Prof. T. Nelson Dale, Williamstown, Mass. 

In the foregoing paragraphs allusion is made only to specimens sent 
in response to special applications. In addition, a large number of sets 
of marine invertebrates, minerals, rocks and ores, etc., have been dis- 
tributed among educational establishments desiring such material both 
for study and exhibition. In this connection it may be stated that very 
few of these collections are left, and unless special provision be soon 
made by Congress which will enable the Museum to engage the services 
of competent assistants to select the duplicate specimens from the 
various collections and make them up into sets, that branch of Museum 
work will have to be practically suspended. It is quite impossible for 
the present force of assistants in the scientific divisions to leave their 
regular duties for special work of this character, which, while very 
desirable and intended to be helpful to other museums, colleges, etc., 
has in it no element of gain whatever to the National Museum. 

COOPERATION OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS OF THE 

GrOVERNMENT. 

The cooperation of the various Executive Departments and Bureaus 
of the Government has continued during the year, and has resulted, 
as usual, in the addition to the collections of valuable and interesting 
material. This is especially so in the case of the U. S. Geological Sur- 
vey, the U. S. Fish Commission, and the Department of Agriculture. 
The Museum not only benefits largely by the law providing that all 
Government collections shall be turned over to it after they ha^'e served 
the purpose for which they were obtained, but it also profits materially 
by the hearty cooperation and courtesy so frequently manifested by 
Government ofiicials. A statement of the material transmitted by the 
various Departments will be found in the Accession List (Appendix ii). 
The collections of particular interest are also referred to by the head 
curators in their annual reports. 

Especial mention should be made of the valuable services rendered 
without remuneration by many of the members of the scientific staff 
of the Museum. There are now thirteen curators, one assistant cura- 
tor, and fifteen custodians who serve the Museum without pay. The 
majority of these are in the employ of other Departments or Bureaus 
of the Government, but have willingly given to the Museum such time 
and attention as could be spared from their regular official duties. 
There are also two collaborators, three associates in zoology, and one 
in paleontology who are attached to the staff in an honorary capacity. 



68 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIMENS AND INFORMATION FURNISHED. 

During- the year 57G " lots" of specimens (Nos. 4494:-50G9, inclusive) 
were received for examination from individuals and educational estab- 
lishments in various sections of the country. Of this material the 
percentage which has been of sufficient interest for addition to the 
Museum collections is very small. This branch of the work yields 
little or no profit to the Museum, since the senders of valuable material 
almost invariably request its return. Moreover, the condition in which 
material is received is frequently a source of delay in securing prompt 
determinations. In many instances the specimens are almost entirely 
destroyed during- transmittal, owing to insufficient packing. 

Pamphlets describing the manner in which si)ecimens of various 
kinds may best be collected and prepared for shipment have been 
widely distributed, and it is hoped that persons desiring to avail them- 
selves of the facilities which the Museum affords in the identification 
of specimens will comply with the suggestions which they contain. 

Technical information on various subjects has been furnished to a 
large number of corres])oudents during the year, and drawings or blue 
jirints of Museum cases have been transmitted to those who have 
ajiplied for them. There is hardly a day when from thirty to forty 
letters are not written in response to communications received from 
persons seeking definite knowledge of some kind. 

PUBLICATIONS. 

The Annual Report of the Museum for 1895 has been imblished, and 
the papers in the Ajipendix have also appeared in separate form. The 
Eeport for 189G is now in type, with the exception of the index, and 
the proof reading of the administrative portion of the volume for 1897 
has been completed. 

Volume XIX of the Proceedings has been published. Most of the 
papers in this volume were issued in separate form during the preced- 
ing fiscal year. The last four, however, were published since July 1, 
1897. Papers 1124-1139, inclusive, constituting Volume xx, have 
appeared. 

The titles of all jjapers which have been published in separate form, 
during the year are given in Appendix v. 

The text of Bulletin 47 is now all in type, with the exception of the 
<' addenda." The work, when completed, will consist of three volumes 
and an atlas. 

Another of the series of pamphlets containing directions for collect- 
ing and preserving natural history specimens has been issued.' This 
paper is by Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell, and contains instructions for the 
collection of scale insects. Circular 48, which has also been published,

The titles of a large number of papers published during the year by 
officers of the Museum and other investigators are given in the Biblio- 
graphy (Appendix iv). Many of these papers appeared in publica- 
tions otlier than those of the Museum. The number of authors repre- 
sented is 83, and the total number of papers mentioned, 234. The sub- 
jects treated upon are indicated in the following table:

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in an order dated 
March 19, 1898, placed 5,800 copies of the .Aluseum Report at the dis- 
posal of the Museum, retaining 1,200 copies, out of the edition of 7,000 
allotted to both establisliments, for distribution by the Institution 
itself. This increase enables the Museum to supply a large number of 
public libraries and schools which had not heretofore received the 
volume. 

In the last Annual Report mention was made of an arrangement by 
which members of the sciciititic staff might, M'ith the approval of the 
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, print i)apers based upon 
Museum material in publications other than those of the Museum. 
During the year permission lias been given to publish sixteen papers 
in this way. The names of the authors are as follows: James E. 



70 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Benedict, Miss M. J. Eathbun, J. IST. Rose, Gerrit S. Miller, jr., Walter 
Hough, Robert Eidgway, David White, Charles Schuchert, and Miss 
Harriet Eichardsou. The titles of those papers which have been pub- 
lished withiu the fiscal year will be found in the Bibliography (Appen- 
dix IV). 

LIBRARY. 

The librarian. Dr. Cyrus Adler, states that the accessions for the 
year were as follows: Books, 848; pamphlets, 1,945; parts of period- 
icals, 16,746; total, 19,539. These figures include the publications 
retained from the accessions to the library of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, which were as follows : Books, 407; pamphlets, 1,148; parts of 
periodicals, 11,817. One thousand books belonging to the Smithsonian 
deposit and 409 belonging to the Museum were bound. 

More than 10,000 books were borrowed during the year, a consider- 
able jiroportion of these beiug assigned to sectional libraries. About 
17,000 books were consulted in the library. 

The work of transferring titles to the new catalogue is progressing. 

Two new sectional libraries have been organized during the year — 
Technology and Stratigraphic Paleontology. There are now twenty- 
three authorized sectional libraries, as follows : 

Administration, Mesozoic fossils, 

Birds, Mineralogy, 

Botany, Mollusks, 

Comparative anatomy, Oriental antiquities. 

Ethnology, Paleobotany, 

Fishes, Parasites, 

Geology, Photography, 

History, Prehistoric archjeology. 

Insects, Reptiles, 

Mammals, Stratigraphic paleontology. 

Marine invertebrates, Technology. 

Medicine, 

EXPLORATIONS. 

A quantity of valuable material has come into the possession of the 
Museum through explorations conducted by members of the Museum 
staff, by other individuals, and by various bureaus of the Government. 

Dr. W, L. Abbott has sent in large collections of birds, mammals, 
reptiles, insects, and other animals collected by himself in lower Siam 
and Kashmir, thus very materially adding to the valuable series of 
specimens which have been received from him in past years. 

Prof. Dean C. Worcester, of Ann Arbor, Michigan, contributed a 
large series of bird skins, eggs, and nests collected in the Philippine 
Islands. 

An interesting series of bird skins collected in Santa Marta, Colom- 
bia, was received from Mr. Outram Bangs, Boston, Massachusetts. 

The Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture, the U. S. 
Fish Commission, and other Governmental bureaus have continued to 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 71 

send in valuable collections obtained by their representatives in the 
field. 

A large lot of invei-tebrates collected by the naturalists of the steamer 
Albatross in recent years on the coasts of California, Japan, and 
Kamchatka and in the Bering Sea should receive special notice. 

A large series of land shells collected in Mexico by the Biological 
Survey constitutes an addition of more than ordinary value. 

The expedition made by Mr. E. P. Carrie in the neighborhood of 
Mount Coft'ee, Liberia, West Africa, under the auspices of the Museum 
and with the valuable assistance of Prof. O. F. Cook, of the Colonization 
Society, resulted in the acquisition of a large number of insects, spiders, 
and myriapods, numbering in all about 5,000 specimens, and some 
valuable reptiles, birds, and mammals. Dr. Leonhard Stejnege-r, while 
pursuing investigations on the Commander Islands as a member of the 
Fur Seal Commission, collected birds, insects and other animals for the 
Museum. Of the insects 28 were found to represent new species and 
others were very rare. Mr. Robert Ridgway made an exploration for 
the Museum in the vicinity of Lake Okechobee, Florida, and obtained 
a considerable number of rare birds. 

Mr. J. N. Rose was engaged for four months in the summer and fall 
of 1897 in making a botanical collection in western and central Mexico. 
He visited a little known part of the country and succeeded in bringing 
back a large and valuable collection of plants. The collection includes 
more than 0,000 specimens and contains more than 100 species new to 
science. Mr. Rose also succeeded in obtaining some interesting ethno- 
logical specimens, including spinners, reels, etc., used by the natives in 
converting cotton and Agave fiber into thread, strings, and rojje. This 
collection also includes native cups, spoons, mats, hats, ropes, etc. In 
each case botanical specimens were obtained which show definitely the 
origin of the products. 

Early in March an opportunity was presented for a botanist to accom- 
pany an expedition to the Keys of south Florida, undertaken by Messrs. 
E. L. Morris and G. N. Collins for the purpose of making general scien- 
tific collections. Mr. Pollard was authorized by the Acting Assistant 
Secretary in charge of the Museum to accompany the expedition, leave 
of absence for two months on full pay being granted him on condition 
that the Museum receive a set of the botanical specimens obtained, and 
that it should not assume payment of transportation or other expenses. 
On March 4 Mr. Pollard proceeded directly with his companions to Key 
West; the party there engaged a boat and made a complete circuit of 
the Keys, reaching Miami, on the coast of Florida, April 5. After a 
week spent at the latter place, the expedition returned by steamer to 
Key West and thence to Washington. About 250 species of plants were 
obtained. These have since been determined by Mr. Pollard and will 
form the subject-matter of a report to be presented for publication at 
an early date. 



72 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Dr. F. "W. True and Mr. D. W. Prentiss, jr., obtained natural history 
material, including about 80 specimens of reptiles and batrachians in 
Maine. 

Dr. George P. Merrill, during his visit to Russia in the summer of 
1897, collected some interesting geological material. 

Mr. Charles Schuchert, assistant curator of the Division of Strati- 
graphic Paleontology, accompanied an expedition under the direction 
of Lieutenant Peary, U. S. N., in July, for the purpose of gatliering 
fossils and other natural history material in the region of Noursoak 
Peninsula, Greeidand, and with a view especially to obtaining speci- 
mens Irom the vicinity of Disko Island, to serve as a basis of compari- 
son with related material gathered from the Cretaceous of the United 
States. Mr. David White, of the U. S. Geological Survey, accom 
panied Mr. Schuchert. A large collection of Cretaceous and Tertiary 
plants was secured; also some interesting specimens of fishes and 
mollusks. 

About 1,300 specimens of pottery and other relics from the vicinity 
of Tucson, Arizona, have been received from Dr. J. W. Fewkes as a 
further result of his explorations in that region. Dr. Walter Hough, 
assistant curator of the Division of Ethnology, accompanied Dr. Fewkes 
in the summer of 1897. 

A number of unique ethnological specimens obtained by Mr. J. B. 
Hatcher in Patagonia were received from the Bureau of Ethnology. 

Material of great value obtained by the exploring parties of the 
Bureau of Ethnology has also been received. 

Collectors^ outfits. — Outfits have been furnished to the following per- 
sons, who have undertaken to collect material for the National Museum : 
Mr. Edward J. Brown, Lemon City, Florida; Mr. John G. Webb, 
Osprey, Florida; Rev. D. W. Snyder, for collecting in Africa; Dr. 
Edgar A. Mearns, U. S. A., Fort Clark, Texas; Hon. J. D. Mitchell, 
Victoria, Texas; Prof. A. E. Verrill, Yale College, New Haven, Con- 
necticut; Mr. George D. Wilder, Pekin, China; Mr. J. A. Loring, Owego, 
New York, for collecting in European countries; Mr. J. S. Holmes, 
Bowman's Bluff, Henderson County, North Carolina. 

Several members of the Museum staff have also been furnished with 
collecting outfits, as follows: Mr. Charles Schuchert, Mr. David White, 
Doctor F. W. True, Miss M. J. Rathbun, Mr. William Palmer, Dr. 
Walter Hough, and Mr. Robert Ridgway. 

In addition to the collecting trips undertaken by members of the 
Museum staff", several of the curators and assistants were absent from 
time to time during the year on other business pertaining to the 
Museum. Some were temporarily in the employ of other departments 
or bureaus of the Government. 

Thus Mr. F. A. Lucas was absent for several months during 1897, 
having been detailed by the President to visit Alaska as a member of 
the Fur Seal Commission. Dr. Stejneger was also a member of this 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 73 

Commission. Mr. Barton A. Bean, assistant curator of fishes, was 
placed on detached service, with instructions to report on July 4 to 
the U. S. Fish Commission, to accompany in the capacity of temporary 
field assistant, a party sent out by the Commission for the purpose of 
conducting an examination of the fish fauna of the group of lakes lying 
east of the Klamatli Lakes in southern Oregon. All necessary expenses 
in connection with Mr. Bean's trip were defrayed by the Commission. 
Dr. Thomas Wilson, curator of the Division of Prehistoric Archa'ology, 
was requested, in connection with his duties as Commissioner from the 
Government of the United States to the International Exposition held 
at Brussels, Belgium, in 1897, to avail himself of the opportunities 
offered by his stay in Brussels to make excursions to points of archaeo- 
logical interest within convenient reach of the Belgian capital, and to 
visit especially the newer anthropological museums of Belgium and 
Holland. He was directed to give particular attention to collecting 
information concerning the buildings occupied by these museums, the 
interior arrangements (exhibition halls, laboratories, storage facilities, 
etc.), and their methods of preparing, labeling, and installing speci- 
mens. He was also authorized to attend, as delegate from the Institu- 
tion and Museum, any congresses or other scientific meetings relating 
to anthropology held in Brussels during the exposition. 

In September Mr. J. E. Watkins, chief of buildings and superintend- 
ence, proceeded to New York City for the purjwse of examining the 
exhibition cases in the American Museum of Natural History and the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art. 

Prof. O. T. Mason, curator of the Division of Ethnology, visited Chi- 
cago in November for the purpose of examining the collections in the 
Field Columbian Museum. 

On December 22 Mr. Charles Schuchert, assistant curator of the 
Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology, was directed to proceed to 
Waynesville, Ohio, for the purpose of representing the interests of the 
National Museum in the matter of shipping to Washington the collec- 
tion of fossils and other specimens bequeathed to the Museum by the 
late Mr. I. H. Harris. 

On February 25, 1898, Mr. Schuchert visited localities in New York, 
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Kentucky for the 
purpose of inspecting fossils in the hands of private collectors, with 
a view to completing the series to be exhibited at the Trans-Mississippi 
Exposition. He was directed to report upon the collections examined 
and make recommendations for the purchase of desirable material. 

On April IG Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, curator of the Division of Ilep- 
tiles and Batrachians, proceeded to Philadelphia to examine collections 
at the residence of the late Prof. E. D. Cope, with a view to identifj'ing 
specimens belonging to the Covernmentbut which liad been temporarily 
in Professor Cope's hands for study. He was requested at the same 
time to avail himself of the opportunity ottered by his presence in

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



Philadelphia to visit the Museum of the Academy of ISTatural Sciences 
for the purpose of arranging for the transmission to Washington of 
specimens belonging to the National Museum. Dr. A. C. Peale was 
also detailed to assist in this work. 

On May 1 Dr. Stejneger left Washington for the purpose of visiting- 
England and the continent of Europe, at his own expense, with a view 
to examining, in certain European museums, types of American species 
of reptiles and batrachians, and specimens of the birds and reptiles of 
Japan and of the north Pacific coast and adjacent islands. Dr. Stejneger 
attended the International Fisheries Exposition, which opened at Ber- 
gen, Norway, on May 16, with the expectation also of attending the 
Fourth International Zoological Congress, which convenes at Cam- 
bridge, England, on August 23. He was especially requested to secure 
information concerning new museum methods in northern Europe. 

Mr. F. A. Lucas, acting assistant curator of Vertebrate Fossils, 
Journeyed to New Haven on May 4 to receive from Prof. O. C. Marsh 
a number of fossil vertebrates for the Museum collection. 

TAXIDERMY AND OSTEOLOGY. 

Seventy-three mammals were received and skinned during the year. 
A considerable proportion of these came from the National Zoological 
Park, as shown in the following table:

In addition, 35 other specimens were received and immediately turned 
over to other departments of the Museum. 

Two large crocodiles were received from the Zoological Park. One 
of these was skinned and preserved for mounting. A skin of an elk 
was made up for the study series; also the skin of a kangaroo, the 
skeleton being taken out entire in each instance. 

Sixty-eight skins were received, as follows:

A specimen of Bassaricyon gabbii was mounted. 

Several hundred large skins, both dry and in pickle, are on hand. 
A large number of skulls of mammals were cleaned. 

Imj)rovements were made in the groups exhibited in the mammal 
hall as follows : The two caribou groups were overhauled and renovated, 
as were also the African monkey group and the sea-otter group. A 
large number of single specimens were cleaned. A group of humming 
birds was designed and arranged for the Division of Birds, and a large 
number of minor matters received attention. 

Mr. M^illiam Palmer, chief taxidermist, was in Nashville for nearly a 
month, engaged in repacking portions of the exhibit sent by the Museum 
to the Tennessee Centennial Exposition. Considerable work was also 
done by Mr. Palmer in connection with the Trans-Mississippi and Inter- 
national Exposition at Omaha. The taxidermists' shop was removed 
to new quarters during the year. 

In the Division of Birds the taxidermists have cleaned aud renovated 
about 2,500 specimens, and have mounted or remounted a number of 
others, a portion of them being intended for exhibition at the Trans- 
Mississippi Exposition. A collection of birds which was exhibited at 
the Tennessee Centennial Exposition was overhauled upon its return. 

Various causes have combined to prevent satisfactory i^rogress in 
osteological work during the period covered by this report. Consider- 
able work has been accomplished, however, under adverse circum- 
stances, as shown by the following table:

PHOTOGRAPHY. 

Seven hundred and forty-six negatives, 790 platinum prints, 686 
silver prints, and 62 cyanotypes have been made for the various depart- 
ments in the Museum. The catalogue of negatives in the custody of 
the photographer, Mr. T. W. Smillie, has been completed; 9,650 blue 
prints having been made for this purpose during the year. 

EXPOSITIONS. 

Tennessee Centennial Exposition. — This exposition opened at Nash- 
ville on May ], 1897, and continued until October 31. An appropri- 
ation of $130,000 was made by Congress for the preparation of a 
Government exhibit, the sum of $14,500 being allotted to the Smith- 
sonian Institution and National Museum from this amount. A slight 
increase in the Smithsonian allotment was afterwards made. Collec- 
tions were exhibited by the following divisions and sections of the 
Museum: Mammals, birds, reptiles and batrachians, fishes, mollusks, 
insects, marine invertebrates, comparative anatomy, paleontology, 
geology, minerals, ethnology, prehistoric archneology, religions, tech- 
nology, electricity, historical collections, and medicine. 

The Eeport of the Smithsonian Institution for the present fiscal year 
contains a full account of the participation in the exposition by the 
Institution and its various bureaus. 

Trmis-Mississipjii cmd International Exposition. — The Trans-Missis- 
sippi and International Exposition opened at Omaha on June 1, 1898, 
and will continue for five months. An appropriation of $50,000 for the 
erection of a Government building was made by Congress, and this 
amount was afterwards increased to $60,000, with an additional appro- 
l^riation of $2,500 for the erection of a building for an exhibit by the 
Life-Saving Service. The sum of $137,500 was appropriated for an 
exhibit by the Executive Departments, the Smithsonian Institution, 
including the National Museum, and the U. S. Fish Commission. Of 
this amount $19,491.71 was allotted to the Smithsonian Institution and 
its bureaus. 

Exhibits have been prepared by each of the three scientific depart- 
ments of the Museum — anthropology, biology, and geology. The Depart- 
ment of Anthropology has sent series illustrative of fire-making and 
illumination, exploitative industries, domestic arts, ceramic art, metal 
working, sculpture, photography, land and marine transportation, and 
the progress in certain branches of electrical engineering; groups of 
life-sized figures representing people engaged in primitive arts; series 
of weapons, tools, and musical instruments, and objects showing the 
history of the development of bookmaking. The exhibit of the Depart- 
ment of Biology includes series of the lower invertebrates, mollusks, 
insects, fishes, reptiles and batrachians, birds, mammals, and aquatic 
plants. The geological exhibits include series prepared in the divisions 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 77 

of physical aud chemical geology, mineralogy and stratigraphic 
paleontology. Each of the sections of the last-named division (namely, 
paleobotany, vertebrate and invertebrate fossils) is represented. 

International Fisheries Exposition at Bergen, Nor way. — Exhibits from 
the fisheries collection in the National Mnseum were lent to the U. S. 
Fish Commission for use in connection witli its exhibit at the Inter- 
national Fisheries Exposition which opened at Bergen in May, 1898.

and Jingles. 

Nautilus, XI, No. 4, Aug., 1897, pp. 38-40. 
"Quarter-decks" and "Jingles" are the 
names locally applied to the shells of certain 
marine mollusks properly known as Crepidula 
fornicata Linne, and A7tomt"« simplex Orbigny. 
Large quantities (thousands of bushels) of 
these shells are taken by dredging in the 
neighborhood of Greenport, N. Y., and sold to 
the oysterraen of that general region to be 
used as "catchment objects" or material for 
forming spawning beds for Ostrea virginica. 

Modiola plicatula Lamarck, au ex- 
tinct locality. 

Xautilus, XI, No. 9, Jan., 1898, pp. 102, 103. 
That portion of the city of Boston west of 
the Public Garden and extending to Roxbury, 
known as the Back-bay section, was fifty 
years ago simply a salt marsh, with occasional 
patches of mud flats. In the greater part of 
this .area the well-known niu.ssel, Modiola pli- 
cattila Lamarck, was abundant, and millions 
must have been destroj'ed when the marshes 
were filled up.

THE CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES OF NORTH 

AMERICA. 



By Edward Drinker Cope, A. M,, Ph. D., 

Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy in the University of Pennsylvania, and 
Member of the U. S. National Academy of Sciences, 



PREFACE. 



The scope of the present work is to give an account of the physical 
characteristics of the reptiles of the orders of Loricata and Squamata, 
which inhabit the Nearctic zoological realm, so far as they are known 
to the writer. That the work is far from complete I am well aware, but 
that it is much in advance of other works in this respect may be well 
admitted, as no general work of the kind has appeared since that of 
Holbrook, half a century ago. With my book on the Batrachia, pub- 
lished in 1889, and Dr. Baur's on the Testndinata (in preparation), the 
access to North American herpetology becomes equal to that which 
the science of ornithology has long enjoyed. 

The principles of classification which have been followed are those 
wliich the nature of the case requires, so far as the author has been 
able to discover them. One general statement may be made as an 
abstract proposition, and that is that the taxonomy of organic beings 
is a register of structural or anatomical characters from the most com- 
prehensive to the smallest divisions. This is generally recognized in 
the case of the former, but there are many naturalists who fail to recog- 
nize it in the case of the more restricted divisions, and especially as 
applying to genera. An indefinite idea of the " naturalness" of the 
collocation of species necessary to constitute genera still lingers in 
their minds. By this idea of a "natural" association of species, they 
mean a group which coincides in possessing a certain community of 
species characters, as color, and color pattern, size, nature of surfaces, 
geographical range, etc., all of which, while of importance in their place, 
are quite irrelevant to the question of generic divisions. I long since 
pointed out that generic characters may, and in fact generally do, arise 
in the process of evolution quite independently of the specific, so that 
certain species of different genera resemble each other in the so-called 
" natural," that is, specific characters, more than they do other species of 
their own genus. The same phenomenon is well known among higher 

155 



156 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

groups, where I have called it " heterology;" that is, the genera of a 
family may parallel more or less the genera of another; or the families 
of one order those of another order. It is not, then, remarkable that 
sometimes one or more species of two or more genera should parallel 
each other. The reason why the aggregate of appearances is sometimes 
preferred to single structural differences as definition of the genus, is 
because it is supposed that the contents of a genus must possess closer 
"affinity" than species of separate genera. But this is not the case in 
many instances, and may not be so in any instance where the evolution 
of generic characters becomes known. Certain it is that in the embry- 
onic life none of the specific characters appear before the generic. 
Hence, species may be polyphyletic as regards genera. 

The essential of systematic biology is exact definition. Taxonomy is 
science only in so far as it is exact. If it be alleged that gradual evo- 
lution of characters must preclude the possibility of exact definition, I 
answer that this will only become a practical truth when all intermedi- 
ate forms have been discovered. And it will never be a practical truth 
for the botany and zoology of any single geologic epoch or period — as, 
for instance, the present one — since most of the connecting forms belong 
to past periods and are not treated of in works in zoology, but in those in 
paleontology. There is therefore no excuse for the loose and inexact defi- 
nitions which some taxonomists are accustomed to inflict on the world, 
which are both unscientific, and serve at the same time to obscure the 
subject and render it inaccessible to the student. It must be admitted, 
however, that in a few instances it occurs that transition between two 
important anatomical characters is discoverable in series of species of 
the existing period. The special nature of such a case will determine 
whether definitions with exceptions stated are admissible or not. 

In the matter of nomenclature the author necessarily follows the rule 
of priority now adopted in all codes, and the definitions of priority 
contained in the report of the committee of the American Association 
for the Advancement of Science of 1876. According to these rules, a 
name can only have a status when accompanied with a description or 
diagnosis of that to Avhich it is applied, whether species, genus, or divi- 
sion of higher rank. In the case of species, a recognizable figure is 
regarded as of equal validity with a description, but a figure possesses 
no discriminative character as a definition of any higher group. I must 
here insist on another point, which it has not been thought necessary 
hitherto to incorporate into any system of rules, since it is one which 
lies at the basis of all language. That is that names shall be properly 
spelled. This is necessary on account of the attempts on the part of 
more or less illiterate persons to construct names for the use of biolo- 
gists, and on account of the fact that certain other naturalists, not so 
illiterate, feel bound to adopt their misspellings, and typographical 
errors as well, on account of the supposed exigencies of the law of 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 157 

priority. Most of these persous take refuge behind the rules of the 
American Ornithologists CJnion, and if the code of that body furnishes 
defense for these violations of the elementary principles of language, 
it should be corrected. Among misspellings are to be included hybrid 
words and words which retain the Greek and other uon- Latin spellings. 
It may be repeated here that the language of scientific nomenclature is 
Latin, and words derived from Greek and other languages are spelled 
according to the rules of the Latin language. 

It is stated above that the geographical scope of the present book is 
the Nearctic realm. The southern continental boundary of this realm 
is, however, not yet entirely clear. It evidently includes a large i^art of 
the Mexican state of Sonora and the Mexican Plateau for a considera- 
ble distance farther south. Owing to lack of collections, it is difficult 
to state what the limit is in this direction, but I have included the state 
of Guanajuato, where Dr. Alfredo Duges has traced many of the ISTorth- 
ern species. On the east coast the fauna of the Tierra Caliente extends 
northward to and even a little beyond the Eio Grande. In southwest- 
ern Texas the presence of the genera of snakes, Sibon, Coniophanes, and 
Drymohius, indicates the northern limit of that fauna. 

The results contained herein are derived chiefly from the collections 
of the United States National Museum. To these I have added infor- 
mation based on my own collections and observations in the field. 
The whole constitutes the first general work on the North American 
Sauria since that of Holbrook in 1845, and the only one on the 
Ophidia since the book of Baird and Girard, published in 1853. Pro- 
fessor Baird had such a work on the Sauria in contemplation during 
his lifetime, and he placed his manuscript in my hands about the year 
1864 for completion. Of this manuscript I have made considerable use 
in the following pages, the greater part of the descriptions of fifty-one 
of the one hundred and nine known species of that suborder being 
from his pen. 

In the descrii)tion of the general characters and distribution of the 
genera of the families of the lizards I have frequently copied the lan- 
guage of Boulenger in the Catalogue of the Lizards in the British 
Museum, with omissions and additions. In the systematic arrange- 
ment of the genera of families of lizards, of which I have been able 
to examine but a limited number of species preserved in spirits, as 
the GeckonidiL', Agamida-, and Gerrhosauridu', I have also followed 
Boulenger. 

Besides the collections of the U. S. National Museum, I have exam- 
ined, in the preparation of this book, material belonging to the Acad- 
emy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and to the Philadelphia 
museums, to whose officers my thanks arc especially due. I wish to 
acknowledge also my indebtedness to Dr. Alexander Agassiz for the 
opportunity of examining some Australian species; to Prof. Charles S.

Class MONOCONDYLIA. 

Subclass REPXILIA. 

The subclass Eeptilia is one of the two into which the members of 
the class Mouocondylia naturally fall. It is deflued as follows: 

Basicranial axis ossified. Vertebral column consisting chiefly of 
centra. Limbs of the uonpisciue type, that is, embracing a single proxi- 
mal element, two propodials, several mesopodials, metapodial, and pha- 
langeal elements. One occipita Icondyle. A distinct quadrate bone, or 
suspensorium of the lower jaw. Mandible segmented. Carpal, tarsal, 
and metapodial elements not coossified with each other. 

Cerebral hemispheres larger than mesencephalon, whose moieties are 
fully exposed above, and not laterally. Cerebellum small. Heart with 
three chambers. Aorta derived from two aorta roots, which consist of 
one or two bows on each side. Lungs cellular, functional. Gall blad- 
der, pancreas, and fat-bodies present. Integument scaly. Mammary 
glands, none. 

Reproduction viviparous or ovoviviiiarous. Fertilization internal. 
Copulatory organs present. Embryo with amnion and allantoisj pla- 
centa, none. 

The Eeptilia are definitely known to appear in geological time in the 
Coal Measures, near the close of the Carboniferous system, although 
they probably appeared earlier during that system. They are repre- 
sented by a number of orders, which are distinguished as follows : 

I. Quadrate bone united with adjacent elements by suture; temporal regions with 

roof of a few symmetrical segments. No distinct postorbital 
bars; vertebne amphicoelous ; ilium narrow, vertical; feet ambu- 
latory COTVLOSAURIA. 

II. Quadrate bone united by suture to adjacent elements; one longitudinal postor- 

bital bar (Synajytosauria). 
a Scapular and pelvic arches not within thoracic and abdominal bones. 

Paroccipital not distinct; no supramastoid ; vertebric amphiccelous ; 
ribs with one head on centrum ; the capitulum, when present, inter- 
central; scapula simple Theromora. 

Paroccipital not distinct, a supramastoid; vertebnu amphiplatyan; ribs 
with one head, and that not intercentral ; scapula triradiate. 

Plesiosauria. 

Paroccipital and supramastoid distinct; vertebrai with two-rib artic- 
ulations on centrum; phalanges, carpals, and tarsals of similar 

form ICHTHYOPTEKYGIA.

postorbital bar [Streptostijlica). 
a A paroccipital bone.

Of these orders, five are extinct and four still exist. Their afftnities

Crocodilia Owen, Kept. Brit. Assoc. Adv. Sci., XI, 1841, p. 65. 

Quadrate bone united by immovable suture with tbe adjacent ele- 
ments; 2 postorbital longitudinal bars; cervical and dorsal ribs mostly 
two-headed, the capitulum articulating with the centrum, with or with- 
out parapophyses, and the tuberculum with the diapophyses. Sacrum 
composed of but few vertebrie. Acetabulum closed. Sternum and 
interclavicle j)resent; abdominal ribs not connected with the true ribs, 
and composed of separate segments. Bones of proximal series of car- 
pus and tarsus specialized. Teeth in alveoli. 

Ventricle of the heart divided. Two aorta roots. Epencephalon with 
vermis and flocculi. Copulatory organ single. Anal orifice longitudi- 
nal. 

The order of the Loricata appeared in Triassic time, and has con- 
tinued up to the present day. The Triassic types differ from those of 
subsequent ages, so that they represeut a suborder distinct from the 
latter. In Jurassic and Cretaceous time the order was represented by 
the greatest number of genera and species. Their distribution has 
been cosmopolitan since their appearance. The affinities of the order 
are with the Dinosauria, with which they are connected by the sub- 
order Sauropoda of the latter. 

The suborders differ as follows: 

External nares posterior; internal naros less posterior; pterygoids articulating 
with quadrate; postfrontal and postorbital bones distinct Parasuciiia. 

Internal nares more posterior; external nares anterior; pterygoids not reaching 
quadrates; postfrontal and postorbital bones not distinct Eusuchia. 

The Parasuchia include, so far as yet known, the single family of the 
Belodontidie. They are restricted to the Triassic system. The fam- 
ilies of the Eusuchia are the following: 

I. Vertebrin amphiplatyan. 

Posterior nares more anterior; sphenoid axis horizontal; postorbital border 

on plane of adjacent bones Teleosaukid.e. 

Postorbital border internal to plane of adjacent bones Goniopholidid.e. 

II. Vertebne procadoiis. 

Sphenoid vertical ; postorbital border internal to adjacefnt plane. Crocodilid/E. 

The first two families do not extend beyond Mesozoic time. The 
Crocodilida'. commence in North America in the Upper Cretaceous; in 
other i)arts of the world in the Eocene. We have to do with this fam- 
ily only in the present work. Its genera differ as follows : 

I. A preorbital foramen. 

Dorsal vertebrae with rudimontal hypapophyses; muzzle elongate, nasal bones 

not reaching nares Thoracosaiirus Leidy.

The genera Thoracosaurus and Holops are restricted, with present 
knowledge, to the Upper Cretaceous formations of North America. 
The other genera still exist, and are restricted to the warmer regions 
of the earth. Tomistoma is Malaysian; CrocodilKs is cosmopolitan; 
Osteolccmus is African, while the other genera are South American, 
excei^t Alligator. This genus includes one North American and one 
east Asiatic species and one of unknown habitat. Gavialis is Indian. 

In North America we have to do with the widely distributed Alligator 
mississippiensis and the Crocodilus americanus, which ranges to the 
southern part of the peninsula of Florida from an extensive habitat in 
tropical America. 

Many remarkable peculiarities characterize the osteology of this 
family. 

The pterj'goids have a veiy peculiar form. They are much expanded 
transversely posteriorly, resembling in this respect tlieCotylosauria and 
some of tlie Theromora of the Permian, but with this the resemblance 
ceases. Near the middle line of the skull each one directs its free 
posterior margin upward, assuming the direction of the basicranial 
axis and, surrouiuling the posterior nares behind, unites with the 
inferior descendihg axis of the sphenoid by a transverse serrate suture. 
The pterygoid plate does not continue its vertical direction for long, but 
soon unites with the quadrate posteriorly'^ and the alisphenoid ante- 
riorly by a serrate suture. This union of the pterygoid with the prox- 
imal extremity of the quadrate, instead of the distal, is a specialization 
peculiar to this family among reptiles. The superior prolongation of the 



J 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 163 

zygomatic (quadratojugal) to the supratemporouiastoid and postfiontal 
is equally peculiar to it. Another peculiarity is tlie non-entrance of the 
exoccipital bone into the occipital condyle. Another remarkable pecu- 
liarity is the union, a short distance below the brain case, of the Eusta- 
chian tubes into a single median vertical canal, which descends to the 
l^harynx between the vertical axes of the basioccipital and sphenoid 
bones. 

The mandibular ramus is characterized by the distinctness of all the 
elements and by two especial peculiarities. One of these is the absence 
of coronoid process, the coronoid bone being a scale on the interior side 
of the ramus. The other is the presence of a very large foramen 
between the angular and surangular bones on the external face of the 
ramus, which communicates with the large dental canal. 

The vertebme are procoelous throughout. There are no intercentra 
except the chevron bones and a preatlantal element, which articulates 
with the lower part of the occiijital condyle in front, and underlaps the 
OS entatum, or centrum of the atlas ; posteriorly. This first and only cer- 
vical interceutrum sends out, posteriorly and downward on each side, a 
long intercentral rib. The atlas consists of separate elements, viz, 
centrum, nenrapophysis, and neural spine. The centrum is united by 
suture with that of the axis vertebra, and the neurapophyses are in con- 
tact anteriorly below with the intercentrum. They narrow upward to 
a squamosal suture with the neural spine, which is a thin, curved ele- 
ment. The cervical ribs are short, and unite with a parapophysis and 
diapophysis. The dorsal ribs have tlie capitular articulation on the 
centrum, and the tubercular on the diapophysis for a short distance, 
but the capitular articulation soon rises to the diapophysis, remaining 
distinct from the tubercular. There are two sacral vertebrae, and no 
sacral ribs. 

There is no clavicle, proscapula, or epicoracoid. The coracoid is in 
contact with the anterior lateral border of the sternum. The supra- 
scapula is represented by a cartilage. The ilium is short auteroposte- 
riorly and does not extend anteriorly to the acetabulum, but does 
extend for a short distance posteriorly to it. The pubis is excluded 
from the acetabulum, articulating with the anterior base of the 
ischium. The pubes are directed forward and have no symphysis, being 
connected by cartilage only. They have no connection with the ischia 
on the median line. The ischia are directed downward to a median 
symphysis. 

There are three elements in the proximal carpal series. Of these the 
radiale and intermeduim support the foot, and are remarkable for their 
longitudinal elongation. The cari)alia are more or less aborted. The 
tarsalia are remarkable for tlie specialization of the bones of the first 
row. They are two in number; the large astragalus consisting, appar- 
ently, of the tibiale and intermedium tarsi. The fibulare (calcaneum) 
has what has not been shown to exist elsewhere among Eeptilia, a tuber

calcis. Both these elements have a distal convex condylar surface for 
the elements distal to them. The tarsalia are partially aborted. 

No urinary bladder. A rudimental diaphragm. The viscera are 
more particularly described under the genus Alligator.

Fourth mandibular tooth fitting into a pit in the upper jaw. Snout 
rather short; nasal bones forming a septum dividing the nasal aper- 
ture; supratemporal fossae open, splenial bones not entering the man- 
dibular symi)hysis. A dorsal shield formed of juxtaposed, keeled, 
bony scutes; gular and ventral scutes without or with thin ossifications. 

Osteology. — My knowledge of the osteology of this genus is derived 
exclusively from the A. mississippiensis. 

Premaxillaries with the spine very short, and uniting by suture with 
the i)roduced apices of the nasal bones. Lateral plate in considerable 
sutural union with the nasals posterior to the nares. Frontal produced 
in a narrow process between i)refrontals. A small supraorbital bone 
anteriorly placed. Parietal-like frontal, undivided, not sending out 
supramastoid processes, and extending to the posterior border of the 
superior table of the skull. Supratemjjoro-mastoid sending out a latero- 
posterior process almost to the extremity of the exoccipital, and bounded 
below posteriorly by the quadrate, medially by the meatus auditoriusj 
and anteriorly from before backward, by the quadrate, the superior 
process of the zygomatic, and by the postorbital jDart of the j^ostfronto- 
orbital. Anteriorly it is bounded by the postfrontal part of the post- 
fronto-orbital. The articular surface of the quadrate is directed as 
much backward as downward. The zygomatic reaches its distal 
extremity in front, while the jugal is continued three-fourths way from 
its first i)oint of contact with the zygomatic to its extremity. The 
parieto-quadrate arch is not entirely fused with the elements lying 
below it, as it is not united with the snpraoccipital by suture, except 
on the middle line. The lateral part of the superior border of the supra- 
occipital is a smooth tuberosity, and a foramen passes entirely below 
the supratemporo-mastoid bone to the supratemporal foramen. Another 
canal passes between the exoccipital and quadrate from behind for- 
ward and inward to the temporal fossa. The snpraoccipital does not 
reach the foramen magnum below, but the latter is inclosed above by 
the exoccipitals. The latter do not enter into the composition of the 
occipital condyle, which consists eritirely of the basioccipital. 

The quadrate is remarkably extended forward. Below, it sends 
down a broad process to join the pterygoid, medially it joins the 



CROCODILIANS. LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 165 

petrosal, while above it joius the alisphenoid, and to a less degree the 
parietal. In its junction with the petrosal it overlaps that bone so 
far as to almost exclude it from the external wall of the brain case, and 
it can only be seen by looking within the posterior border of the tri- 
geminal foramen. The alisphenoid is well developed, and joins above 
thedecurved border of the parietal posteriorly, the postfrontal medially, 
and the frontal anteriorly. The alisphenoids meet on the middle line, 
leaving a large foramen above for the rhinencephalon, and a large 
8-shaped foramen below. The inferior part of the latter is immediately 
posterior to the keel-like anterior process of the sphenoid. A strong 
process descends to the pterygoid, bounding the trigeminal foramen in 
front. This represents the epipterygoid of the Sauria. No orbito- 
sphenoid or other interorbital bone. 

The anterior half of the basioccipital has its longitudinal axis verti- 
cal. The long axis of the sphenoid is also vertical. The medullary 
part of the brain case is roofed by the exoccipitals only, but the supra- 
occipital bounds the epencephalon above. The petrosal is much more 
conspicuous on the internal than on the external wall of the brain case. 
It is suboval, and is bounded by the alisphenoid, sphenoid, exoccii)ital, 
supraocciijital, and to a small degree by the parietal. It is deeply 
notched in front by the trigeminal foramen. Although the sphenoid is 
mainly vertical in position it sends forward between the alisphenoids 
a vertically compressed plate, already mentioned. The occipital and 
sphenoid elements are coarsely cellular at various points. The ptery- 
goids unite together on the median line and join the sphenoid behind 
the posterior nares. The pterygoids send forward a i)rocess above the 
palatines to the front of the orbits, where they cease. Here a strong 
X)rocess of the prefrontal descends on each side and rests on the adja- 
cent iiarts of the palatine and pterygoid. These processes are separate 
on the middle line above and below, but touch at the middle of their 
length. The ectopterygoids are large and each sends a process forward 
on the maxillary, and a longer one on the pterygoid. The palatine and 
maxillary bones are in nuitual contact on the middle line, and no jjart 
of the vomer or ethmoid is visible on the external surface. 

The mandibular ramus has a rather elongate angle, which has its 
superior concave surface divided lengthwise by an obtuse ridge. The 
articular bone forms the greater part of the angle, the angular being a 
narrow strip on its inferior side, which forms the apex, the surangular 
sending a narrow splint on the external side, which does not extend so 
far as the two other elements. The cotylus is not divided by a ridge, 
but a transverse section is gently sigmoid, descending inward. The 
coronoid is a large scale in front of the very large dental foramen, and 
does not extend anterior to the vertical line of the angular. A large 
foramen is inclosed between the latter and the spleuial. The latter 
element forms the entire internal side of the ramus, terminating acutely 
below and within the fourth tooth. The groove in front of its apex is 



166 REPORT OF NATIONAL. MUSEUM, 1898. 

closed with a straight suture at the fundus. There is a foramen on the 
inner side of the splenial opposite the eighteenth tooth, counting from 
the front. The angular extends farther forward than the suraugular, 
and its narrow apical portion is on the inferior face of the ramus, ter- 
minating at the eighteenth tooth. 

In young specimens the posterior alveoli are not sei)arated from each 
other, and the crowns of the teeth are more compressed than in adults. 

The atlantal neural spine has no spinous process, but it is well devel- 
oped on the other vertebr;e. The atlas sends posteriorly a slender rib, 
which is slightly bifurcate proximally. The other cervical ribs send a 
distal process forward as well as backward. The dorsal ribs have a 
small cartilaginous uncinate process near their distal extremities. The 
abdominal ribs consist of four ossicles, forming a chevron directed for- 
ward. The interclavicle has no transverse branch, and extends well 
in advance of the sternum and nearly to its posterior border. The 
hnemal ribs unite with the sternum, as follows : Two pairs unite directly, 
and four jiairs with a median xiphoid cartilage. 

The coracoid is an elongate element, distally truncate, without 
notches or processses: the usual foramen pierces it near the base. The 
scapula is of somewhat similar form; it has no pro- or nieso- scapular 
process or angle. The humerus has one compressed tuberosity at a 
considerable distance distad of the head. The distal extremity much 
resembles that of the femur. The ulna is robust proximally, and the 
olecranon is represented by a large sesamoid bone. The shaft of the 
radius less compressed than that of the ulna, but is not very different 
in actual sectional area. Its distal articular surface is a little larger 
than that of the ulna, and is at nearly a right angle to it. In the 
carpus the radiale is a much larger bone than the intermedium, but 
both are similar in form, being much longer than wide, and having 
expanded extremities and contracted shafts. Their distal articular 
faces are concave. The ulnare projects freely backward. There is 
but one carpale, and that corresponds with the third digit. The I and 
II are represented by a cartilage. No centrals. Digits live, of which 
the third is longest and the fifth shortest. The I, II, and III only 
have the distal phalanges unguiform and sheathed with horny claws. 

The ilium jirojects as far as the diapophysis of the first caudal verte- 
bra but does not fuse with it. The proximal end of the ischium is deeply 
notched, which causes a perforation of the acetabulum. The femur 
is longer than the humerus and the head is less compressed. There 
is no distinction into the head and neck. There is but one trochanter 
and that is on the posterior aspect and presents its tuberosity distad. 
The condyle of the femur is not divided; no patella. The fibula is 
much more slender than the tibia at all points. The astragalus articu- 
lates with the fibula as well as with the tibia ; its face of articulation 
with the calcaneum is excavated. The latter has a convex fibula sur- 
face, while the tibial surface of the astragalus is concave. Posterior to 
the fibular condyle the calcaneum is excavated, and the tuber calcanei is 



CROCODILFANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 167 

somewhat recurved at the apex. It is obliquely truueate behind and 
below. The inferior lace is excavated and the distal plane. There are 
three tarsalia corresponding to tour external digits; the llrst digit 
articulating directly with the astragalus, the second digit joins one tar- 
sale, the third and fourth one, while the fifth digit is lacking. The fifth 
tarsale is })roduced like a rudiuiental metatarsal. The three interior 
digits only have uuguiform distal phalanges with corneous sheaths. [ 

Viscera. -The heart is situated in the anterior part of the body cav- 
ity, and the lungs extend about half their length posterior to it. The 
latter extend considerably cephalad of the bronchi, which enter at 
about the posterior third of their length, at right angles to the axis of 
the body. The liver is completely divided into right and left moie- 
ties, each of which sends posteriorly a process of its external portion. 
The alimentary canal is distinguished for the strong differentiation 
of the stomach, which much exceeds anything known in the Sauria. 
The cardium and pylorus are each small orifices, and the stomach has 
a fundus at either end external and caudad to each. Toward the 
pyloric fundus tlie walls are very thick with muscle. At its apex is a 
siuall diverticulum in the ^1. mississiijpiensifi. The small intestine is of 
relatively small diameter and the large intestine is large, and is not 
distinguished into colon and rectum, and has no ciecum. The kidney 
is coarsely lobate. 

The mesenteries are not so simple as in the Sauria, as they are less 
less distinct from each other, and send branches in different directions. 
The (I'sophagus has, besides the dorsal connection, connection with the 
pericardium. The lungs are connected with both, and distally with 
the cephalad surface of the liver. The liver has connection posteriorly 
with all of these viscera, which is not muscular, but which represents 
the dorsal part of the pericardium. A longitudinal fold connects the 
pericardium with the two halves of the liver and the stomach, repre- 
senting the gastrohepatic mesentery of the Sauria. From the caudad 
margin of the liver on the right side a sheet extends to the body wall, 
remaining free from the latter as far posteriorly as the kidney. A 
corresponding slieet extends from the distal aspect of the stomach on 
the right side. Both are connected with the body wall by bands and 
threads. From each lobe of the liver near the median line a sheet 
extends to the median body wall below, which is strongly muscular. 
This is regarded as homologous with the inferior portion of the dia- 
phragm of the mammals, and this with the posterior transverse hepato- 
dorsal sheet may correspond with that structure. If so, the important 
difference remains that in the alligator it includes the liver between 
its two layers, while in the mammals it is entirely superior to the liver. 

The tympanic drum is deeply set beneath the superior postorbital 
bar. It is protected by a fold of the integument which forms a fiap, 
which is sus] tended from the postorbital bar, closing the orifice like a 
lid.

than Crocodilns, no undoubted extinct species having been discovered. 
The neocene Crocodilns spencerU of England has been found to vary in 
the direction of Alligator, and on such an individual was proposed the 
A. hantoniensis, but the characters are said not to be normal. 

Species. — Three species of this genus are known. One is the North 
American; the other is found in China, and the habitat of the other is 
unknown. Their characters are as follows: 

The broadest series of dorsal scutes composed of eight scutes; four large nuchal 
scutes; upper eyelid bouy anteriorly; fingers webbed ; end of tail strongly com- 
pressed and crested A. minsiss'qjjuensis Daudin. 

The broadest transverse series of dorsal scutes composed of eight scutes ; two large 
nuchal scutes ; fingers free ; end of tail little serrated above, scarcely compressed.

Nineteen or twenty upper and as many lower teeth on each side; 
head nearly twice as long as broad; snout much depressed, broadly 
rounded at the end, with the lateral outline nearly straight; a very 
short ridge in front of the orbit; upper eyelid bony anteriorly; two 
pairs of large nuchal scutes, forming a square, separated on the median 
line, with a pair of small ones in front and another pair behind; seven- 
teen or eighteen transverse series of dorsal scutes, the broadest com- 
posed of eight scutes ; fingers hardly half webbed, outer toes about two- 
thirds webbed ; tail strongly compressed and crested posteriorly. Dark 
green or blackish above, young with yellowish cross bands, lower parts 
yellowish. 

Total length, 2 meters 20 centimeters; reaches a length of 4^ meters 
(about 16 feet). 

In young specimens, of a meter in length, the anterior parts of the 
nasal and maxillary bones present coarse, flat tuberosities, while the 
middle parts of those bones are nearly smooth. In adults the former 
regions are nearly smooth, wliile the latter are pitted, producing a 
shallow honeycombed surface. The posterior parts of the same bones

arc nearly sraootli, or feebly ridged longitudinally. The frontal, post- 
frontal, parietal, and suprateniporo-mastoid are always pitted. There 
is a low longitudinal median ridge of the frontal bone between the 
anterior parts of the orbits. The olfactory groove of the frontal is 
narrow, and their lateral walls robust and low. The posterior part of 
the surangular bone is honeycombed, while the dentary is smooth, but 
is perforated by numerous small foramina. 

The vertebrai number as follows: C, 8; D., 10 j L., 7; S., 2; C, 36. 
Thie neural spines of the cervicals are narrower auteroposteriorly than 
those of the dorsals, except that of the axis, which Is much the longest, 
but is not more elevated than the others. The hypapophysis of the sec- 
ond cervical is very low, but those of the other cervicals and of the 
anterior four dorsals are well develo])ed ; there is a low one on the fifth 
dorsal. The mutual surfaces of the centra of the second sacral and 
first caudal are flat. But tliree of the ribs articulate with the vertebral 
centra, the remainder having the capitular articulations with the 
diapophyses at increasing distances from their bases. Of the caudal 
vertebme the anterior 18 have dia])0i)hyses. The first and second have 
no chevrons, which are present on the following 21. The terminal cen- 
tra are much compressed. The last abdominal rib is much more robust 
than the others. It is similarly composed and posteriorly joins the 
pubes at their bases. The phalanges are as follows: M anus, 2-3-4-3-3; 
pes, 2-3-4-3. These details are derived from a skeleton in the museum 
of the School of Biology of the University of Pennsylvania. 

The alligator is characteristic of the Austroriparian region, ranging 
from jSTorth Carolina to the liio Grande of Texas. I have examined 
crania of individuals taken in the Nueces River, Texas, and do not find 
them to difler in any respect from tliose taken in Florida. 

As regards the range of the alligator up the Mississippi, I have 
gaii\ed the following information through my friend, Mr. Julius Hurter, 
of St. Louis, who has for many years made a study of the batrachians 
and reptiles of Missouri. He states that the oldest residents of the 
southeastern county of that State have no knowledge of the occurrence 
of the species in that locality. The most northern locality with which 
Mr. Hurter is personally acquaim ed is Rodney, Jefferson County, Miss., 
about latitude 32°. 

Dr. Hugh M. Smith,' of the United States P'ish Commission, says 
that— 

The luaternal alligator iu April or May seeks a sheltered spot on a bank and there 
builds a small mound. The foundation of the mound is of mud and grass, and on 
this she lays some eggs. She covers the eggs with another stratum of grass and jnud, 
upon which she deposits some more eggs. Thus she proceeds until she has laid from 
100 to 200 eggs. 

The eggs in the course of time are hatched by the sun, assisted by the heat which 
the decomposition of the vegetable material generates. As soon as they have 
"chipped the shell," the baby alligators are led to the water by the mother, who

provides them with food which she disgorges, showing much imxiety for theirsafety. 
At this early period of their existence they are exposed to many dangers, being a 
favorite prey of fishes and turtles. Alligators' eggs are sometimes eaten by the 
Florida crackers. The robbing of the nests for market is helping to hasten the inev- 
itable destruction of the alligator fishery, wliich has been an important and profit- 
able industry in Florida. Facts recently gathered by the Fish Commission show 
that the reptiles can not long escape practical extermination. Already they are 
l>ecoming scarce, and the price of hides has gone up. 

It is estimated that 2,500,000 alligators were killed in Florida between 1880 and 
1891. 

In 1890 about 250 pounds of alligator teeth were sold, hunters receiving from $1 
to $2 a pound for them. They are removed by burying the heads and rotting out 
the teeth. Of the best teeth, about seventy make a pound. The stuffing of alli- 
gators and the polishing of the teeth give employment to forty persons. Unfortu- 
nntely, alligators grow very slowly. At 15 years of age they are only 2 feet long. 
A 12-footer may be reasonably supposed to be 75 years old. 

The artifical propagation of alligators has been recently undertaken to supply the 
trade in Florida curiosities. 

The incubator system employed is ([uite simple. The eggs, which are about the 
size of those of a goose, are placed in boxes of sand and covered up. The boxes are 
exposed on a roof to the torrid rays of a tropical sun, and in a few days the young 
reptiles are hatched.

Ooncerniug this geuus Bouleiiger remarks : ' 

Notwithstanding all that has heen written on the specific characters of the croco- 
diles, their distinction and definition remains a matter of considerable difficulty. 
Although the extreni(3 forms, viz, C. cataphractiis and C.palustris, differ very widely, 
the passage is so comi)lcte as to render even subgeneric divisions unadvisable. The 
following key will. I hope, suffice in most cases for the exact determination of the, 
species, except with respect to newly born specimens, which can only be named by 
comparison with older examples. 

Bouleager then gives the following table of the species : 

f. Snout very slender, gavial-like, at least twice as long as broad at the base; man- 
dibular symphysis extending to the level of the sixth, seventh, or 
eighth tooth; premaxillo-maxillary suture, on the palate, prodiiced 
posteriorly. 

Nuchal scutes in two longitudinal series, continuous or subcontiuuous 
with the dorsals C. cataphractus Cuvier. 

Nuchal scutes six, four in a square with one on each side, subcoutinuous 
with the dorsals C. johnstonii Krefl't. 

Nuchal scutes six, four in a square with one on each side, widely sepa- 
rated from the dorsals C. intermedins Graves. 

II. Snout more than once and a half, and not more than twice and a one-fourth as 

long as broad at the base; mandibular symphysis extending to the 
level of the fourth or fifth tooth; premaxillo-maxillary suture, on the 
jialate, produced posteriorly. 

A. No longitudinal ridge in front of the eye; anterior nuchal scutes (post- 

occipitals) well developed. 
A longitudinal swelling or ridge along the middle of the snout. 

C. americanus Laurenti. 
A longitudinal ridge between the orbits, none on the snout. 

C. siamensis Schneider. 
No ridges on the forehead or snout C. niloticus Laurenti. 

B. A longitudinal ridge iu front of the eye; anterior nuchals usually absent. 

C. porosus Schneider. 

III. Snout not more than once and a half as long as broad at the base; mandibular 

symphysis extending to the level of the fourth or fifth tooth, premaxillo- 
maxillary suture, on the palate, transverse or curved forward. 

A. Snout without ridges. 

Dorsal shield usually composed of four longitudinal series of scutes, the 

median of which are broader than long. C. palustris Lesson. 

Dorsal shield composed of six longitudinal series of scutes in the mid- 
-» die C. rohmitns Vaillant and Grandidier. 

B. A more or less distinct oblique ridge in front of the eye. 

Scales on upper surface of limbs keeled C. rhomhifer Cuvier, 

Scales on limbs perfectly smooth C. moreletn A. Dum6rii. 

Species of this genus are abundant in the Cenozoic formations from 
tlie Eocene onward, but they become rarer in the later beds. The 
above-mentioned existing species are distributed as follows: 

Neotropica. Ethiopica. Indica.

Eighteen or nineteen upper teeth on each side. Snout variable in 
length, one ahd three-fifths to two and one-fourth as long as broad 
at the base; a median ridge or longitudinal swelling along the snout; 
niandibidar symphysis extending to the fourtli or fifth tooth; premax- 
illo-maxillary suture, on the palate, directed backwards; maxillaries 
forming a short median suture above or narrowly separated by the 
nasals. Usually four large nuchals forming a square, wath a smaller 
one on each side of the anterior j)air; the large nuchals sometimes fol- 
lowed by one or two detached pairs of smaller scutes ; usually two pairs 
of smaller nuchals in a transverse row behind the occiput. Dorsal scutes 
well separated from the nuchals, in fifteen or sixteen transverse and 
four or six longitudinal rows; the scutes of the two median rows regu- 
larly arranged, the others more or less irregular and more strongly 
keeled; sides with scattered keeled scutes. A slight web between the 
second and third fingers; outer toes extensively webbed. A serrated 
fringe on the outer edge of the leg; scales on the limbs keeled. Black- 
ish olive above, yellowish inferiorly; young pale olive, dotted and 
spotted with black. (Boulenger.) 

The largest specimen in the collection measures 3i meters. 

Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Central America, Southern Mexico, 
West Indies, Florida. 

This species varies a good deal in the number and arrangement of 
the nnchal scutes. Sjjecimens from Tehuantepec, on the west coast of 
Mexico, exhibit from two to four nuchal scuta and from two to five 
cervical. Several specimens present the irregnlarity of having scuta 
of the external dorsal series to Join on the middle line of the back, 
replacing the median row of scutes at those points.'

Mr. W, T. Hornaday originally observed this species to be au inhabi- 
tant of the seacoast, streams, and lakes of southeastern Florida,^ rang- 
ing north as far as Lake Worth, a hundred miles north of the southern 
extremity of the State. From this point Mr. Ward, of Eochester, New 
York, obtained a specimen 9 feet in length. Mr. Hornaday supposed 
these individuals to represent a species different from that of more 
southern waters, but I have been unable to detect any difference. The 
largest specimen he obtained measured 14 feet in length. 

In its preference for salt water this species differs from the alligator. 
It is said also to be more vicious in its disposition. A si)ecimen 
between 4 and 5 feet in length was once sent me by my late friend, 
Professor Poey, of Havana. I kept it tethered in a yard and observed 
its manners. It was ill-natured and not afraid to attack either by 
snapping its jaws or striking with its tail. 

A specimen of this species was sent to the National Museum from 
Mazatlan, on the coast of Sinaloa, Mexico. This is the nearest point 
to the Nearctic realm at which it has been found on the Pacific coast. 

SQUAMATA. 

1. GENERAL ANATOMY. • 

No quadratojugal (zygomatic) arch; quadrate therefore articulated 
by its proximal extremity only. No os tabulare. Paroccipital present; 
opisthotic early fused with the supramastoid, probably fused with the 
parietal. Nostrils, both external and internal, subterminal. Maxillo- 
palatines, i)alatines, and pterygoids distinct, paired; ectopterygoid 
present and distinct. Teeth on maxillary and dentary bones. Stapes 
with a long shaft, or columella, terminating in a cartilage. 

Vertebral centra proco'lons, rarely ami)liic<i'lous; caudals with chev- 
rons. Neural arches coossified with centrum, except atlas, which has 
neurapophyses separate from body and from each other; odontoid 
j)rocess distinct. Not more than two vertebra) in sacrum. Cervical 
ribs. Dorsal ribs single (i. e., tubercular) headed, articulating with 
diapophyses; one to several pairs articulating with sternum. No 
sacral ribs. No tegumentary abdominal bones. 

Scapular arch, when developed, consisting of suprascapula, scapula, 
precoracoid, coracoid, (;lavicle, and interclavicle; frequently a pro- 
scapula. The scapula is not coossified with tlie other elements. Cora- 
coid articulating with the simple idate-like sternum. Pelvic arch, 
when complete, embracing the three elements, which inclose below a 
large obturator foramen. Ilium directed backward and upward. 

Brain with large olfactory lobes, which are not as large as the hemi- 
spheres. The latter are larger than the thalami, and their ventricles 
are on the external side of their nucleus (corpus striatum), Thalami 
exposed above as well as laterally. Cerebellum small, without flocculi. 



' American Naturalist, IX, 1875, i>. 498. 



176 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Central canal of spinal cord present. The eye possesses the usual 
character of the Mouocondylia in the presence of the pecten, which 
extends from the choroidea to the sheath of the lens. It is not so 
plicate as in birds. The organ of hearing conforms to the same type 
in the absence of a helix and the presence of a lagena and sacculus. 
The sympathetic nervous system is well developed and presents the 
series of subvertebral ganglia. 

The alimentary canal is little specialized in the different parts of its 
course, but the stomach is distinguished by its greater diaujcter and 
generally more muscular walls. The diameter of the rectum generally 
exceeds that of the preceding parts of the canal. Gall bladder and 
pancreas present. Adipose bodies present. 

Heart with three chambers ; two auricles and one ventricle. The lat- 
ter gives origin to a truncus communis arteriosus, which sends off one 
or two aorta bows on each side, which combine to form a single aorta 
root on each side, which fuse into the single aorta on the middle line 
below the vertebral column. A sinus venosus. Posterior vena cava, 
formed from the renal veins and traversing the liver after receiving 
the portal vein. It is received, together with two jugulars, into the 
sinus venosus. Posterior vertebral veins running below the ribs. 

Sexes distinct. Testis and vas deferens distinct from renal ducts, 
discharging separately into cloaca. Males with two prehensile organs, 
each inclosed in a sheath, one on each side of the base of the tail. 
They are everted toward the cloaca! orifice when in use and are 
retracted by invagination by the contraction of an axial muscle. They 
are traversed by a groove, the sulcus spermaticus, which, beginning at 
the base on the inner side, winds to the apex on the outer side, uniting 
into a short, common vagina oi)ening into the cloaca from above to 
receive the male prehensile organs. Oviducts distinct. The oviduct 
consists of a tube, which, when not containing eggs, is collapsed, fall- 
ing into numerous parallel, transverse folds. These folds are held in 
place by an elastic band on each opposite border. The margin of the 
fontanelle is of delicate membrane, and it is attached to the body wall 
by a delicate fold of })eritoueum 

The integument is characteristically divided into small areas or 
scales, by confluent inflections. These are occasionally the seat of 
osseous deposit (Scincidtc, Gerrhonotidae), but this is exceptional. No 
osseous scuta, other than the cases mentioned. This description 
applies as well to the extinct Pythonomorj)ha as to the Sauria and 
Ophidia. Abdominal scales generally different from the dorsal. 

The integument of the head is divided in many types into plates of 
definite relations, which are homologous throughout the various sub- 
divisions, and even between the suborders of Sauria and Ophidia. In 
general, it may be believed that these plates have resulted from the 
fusion of scales, both because scales are the primitive covering of the 
body and are less si)ecialized than the head plates, but also because

the types of affiuity with the extinct types have scaly heads; for 
instance, the Sjyhenodon of the Tihynchocephaliau order is approached 
closely in scale characters by the Pachygloss lizard. The ]>oida*, 
among snakes, recognized as the most primitive forms, also have 
generally scaly heads and few or no plates. The scaly head also char- 
acterizes some of the higher types of snakes, as many Solenoglypha, 
as well as the degenerate Epanodonta and Oatodonta; while most of 
the degenerate Sauria have head plates, but more or less fused.

2. DISTRIBUTION AND HABITS. 

The Squamata are found iu all except the Arctic and Antarctic 
regions of the earth. Their numbers, both in species and individuals, 
increase as we approach the Tropics. They are preeminently terrestrial 
animals, and are never found far from shore, excepting certain snakes 
which live in the ocean. On land they inhabit all localities that supply 
food and shelter, whether in trees, on the surface of the earth, or 
beneath the surface, or along the shores of bodies of water. They are 
for the greater part carnivorous, but certain lizards and a very few 
snakes are herbivorous. 

The Squamata, like other reptiles, possess much muscular power, and 
above all others many of them are capable of great speed of motion. 
Many of the arboreal species climb with wonderful rapidity, and others 
get over the ground with great swiftness. Such are especially the 
Teiidffi, or swift lizards, who are almost invisible when running, and 
some of the snakes. A few lizards {Aniblyrhynchus) are good swimmers, 
while along all bodies of fresh water dwell snakes which are such 
expert swimmers that they readily capture the fishes on which they 
prey. The prehensile power of the Peropodous snakes is well known, 
enabling them to kill small and medium-sized mammals by involving 
them iu their coils. Certain of the snakes have none of the remarkable 
powers of speed, prehension, or swiftness possessed by others, but are 
protected by a formidable poisonous biting apparatus, which enables 
them to inflict mortal wounds on their prey, and which places them in 
the front rank of dangerous animals. 

The Squamata exhibit a low order of intelligence. Most of them 
give few exhibitions of it, and it is then generally in connection with 
obtaining food. They sometimes appear to recognize the person that 
feeds them, and will overcome their timidity so for as to take food from, 
the hand. I give an account, under the head of Liopeltis vernalis, of a 
ruse adopted by this species for the purpose of taking prey; and under 
Seterodon plafyrhinus, of actions apparently intended to inspire fear in 
a venomous snake with which it was confined. 

3. CLASSIFICATION. 

The Squamata are known under three princijjal modifications or sub- 
orders, as follows : 

Quadrate boue articulating with exoccipital ; parietal bones not closing the brain 
case in front; generally an epipterygoid and sternum; teeth with dentinal roots; 
phalanges with condyles Sauria. 

Quadrate bone articulating with paroccipital; parietal bones not closing brain case 
in front; epipterygoid and sternum present; teeth with osseous roots; phalanges 
truncate Pythonomorpha. 

Quadrate bone articulating with paroccipital; parietal and frontal bones closing 
brain case in front; uo epipterygoid or sternum; teeth rootless; no phalanges 
Ophidia. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 179 

Of these three suborders, the Pythonomorpha is extinct, having 
begun and ended with Cretaceous time. The Sauria and Ophidia are 
the subjects of the present work. Both begin in Cretaceous time, so 
far as our present knowledge extends, but it is at the existing geo- 
logic period of time that they present the greatest multiplication of 
individuals and species. This statement is, of course, provisional and 
dependent on future discoveries in paleontology for its verification or 
contradiction. 

The superficial characters given by systematic writers generally as 
distinguishing the Sauria and Ophidia are quite insufficient for that 
purpose. Johannes Miiller ^ first placed the distinction on a sound 
basis by showing that in the Ophidia the frontal and parietal bones 
descend to the basi-cranial axis as in no other vertebrates, thus closing 
the brain case in front, while in the Sauria this does not occur, and 
as the ali- and orbito- sphenoid bones are rudimental or wanting, the 
brain case is without osseous wall in front. Some lizards present a 
distinct approximation to the ophidian type in the strong decurvature 
of the ijarietal bones at the rides; these are the Annulati and the 
Annielloida. These groups display a similar approximation in the con- 
tinuous sutural union of the occipital and parietal elements, a condition 
universal in Ophidia and rare in Sauria. 

I have pointed out^ another point of distinction between the two 
divisions, viz, that the supratemporal ("squamosal"' olim) is present in 
the Sauria and absent in the Ophidia. As it is, however, absent in 
the Annielloida and Amphisba-nia, I have not included it in the defi- 
nition of the former suborder. This definition has not been adopted by 
those authors who erroneousl}^ regard the suspensorium of the (juad- 
rate bone in the Ophidia as identical with the sui)ratemporal of the 
lizards. I pointed out in the above essay (1871) that this element in the 
snakes is homologous with the paroccipital of the Sauria, an opinion 
which was not agreed with at that time, but which has now received tlie 
assent of various anatomists, notably Professor Baur. 

Baur and some others do not, however, agree that the element in ques- 
tion is the paroccipital, but call it squamosal and other names. I was 
led to identify it with the former element of the Testudinata, etc., by a 
consideration of its structure in the Pythonomorpha,^ where it is much 
more largely developed than in the Sauria, and where it supports the 
quadrate bone as in the Ophidia, which it does not do, or does only 
partially in a few cases, in the Sauria. I have made this more clear 
than heretofore I hope in a recent essay.^ The paroccipital bone is 
received deeply between the exoccipital and the petrosal in the Pytho- 
nomorpha in the same manner as in the Tortricine snakes, a structure 
which does not occur in the Sauria. This structure is somewhat

masked iu some genera of Pythonomorj)ha by the extension of the 
exoccipital over the paroccipital as a thin lamina on the posterior side; 
but its true relation to the petrosal can be seen on the anterior side. 
There can be no doubt that the Pythonomori)ha form a line distinct 
from the Sauria, and that their resemblances to the Varani are the 
result of a parallel evolution rather than an indication of near affinity, 
as supposed by Cuvier. 

The failure of Cuvier, Owen, Dollo, Baur, and Marsh to perceive this 
fact is due to their want of information as to what the differences 
between the Ophldia and Sauria really are. Bouleuger only has 
reached correct views on the subject, although not on account of the 
structure of the paroccipital, but on account of the character of the 
dentition and of the limbs.^ 

The third character which I have pointed out as distinguishing the 
suborders of Squamata is the difference in the mode of articulation of 
the quadrate bone with the adjacent cranial elements. In tbe Sauria 
it articulates with the exoccipital, being also in contact with the par- 
occipital and the suprateniporal. The contact with the paroccipital is 
insignificant, owing to the small size of that element; and that with 
the suprateniporal is only important where that bone is well developed. 
In many Sauria it is feeble or wanting. In the Pythonomorpha and 
Ophidia on the other hand the (quadrate articulates with the parocci- 
pital, sometimes touching the supratemporal in the former. In some 
of the degraded Oj)hidia, as the Typhlopidic and Stenostomidae, the i^ar- 
occipital is not distinct, so that the quadrate appears to rest on the exoc- 
cipital and the petrosal. It will, however, be necessary to subject these 
types to more searching investigation before it can be known that the 
paroccipital is absent. 

As exceptions to the rule in the Sauria, Boulenger has pointed out that 
the quadrate does not reach the exoccipital in the Agamid genus Ghlam,y- 
dosaurus,^ and I have found the same condition in Phrynocephalus.^ 

4. PHYLOGENY. 

From this point of view the Ophidia and Pythonomorpha must be 
traced to some type in which the paroccipital bone is less remote from 
the brain case than is seen iu the Sauria, where it has become a mere 
rudiment. Such a phylogeny would be expressed as follows. An 
investigation of the Dolichosauria of the Cretaceous might yield inter- 
esting results.

This common ancestor is a land rejitile with the peculiar character 
of the paroccipital seen in the Pythouomori)ha. Wliether it would 
enter this suborder remains to be ascertained. From it the Saurian 
type has been derived by the reduction of the paroccipital, and its wide 
remova? from the cranial wall. The ophidian order has resulted from 
an enlargement of this element, together with its exclusion from the 
cranial walls, to which it nevertheless remains adherent. Boulenger' 
suggests that the IJoIichosauria occupy this position. 

The Squamata display among Reptilia tendencies Avhich reach their 
extreme expression in the Ophidia. These are, as already pointed out, 
first, the disposition to reduction in the use of the limbs as supports of 
the body, and a consequent increasing tendency to rest the body on the 
ground when in motion; second, the increasing mobility of the suspeu- 
sorium of the mandible, permitting an increase in the gape of the 
mouth, and the consequent capacity for swallowing large bodies. 
These tendencies are seen, first, in the successive shortening of the 
limbs and reduction in the number of the digits, and finally reduction 
and abolition of the limbs themselves. It is characteristic of the entire 
suborder that the ribs have only the tubercular articulation with the 
veterbra', having lost the capitular, thus reducing the strength of the 
suspension of the viscera from the vertebral column. It thus becomes 
first comfortable, and finally necessary that the body should be sup- 
ported by the earth or object on which the animal rests, the process 
being identical with that which has taken place in the Cetacea, which 
have also lost the capitular rib articulations after long suspension of 
the body in the water. This change is, of course, completed by the 
total loss of limbs, as is seen in many Sauria and in all Ophidia. The 
freedom of the distal extremity of the quadrate bone gives mobility 
to the mandible; but this function does not reach any great develop- 
ment in the Sauria, and is but little more obvious in the inferior 
Ophidia (Angiostomata). In the Ophidia generally it acquires an 
enormous development, most of all in the highest venomous forms 
(Solenoglypha). 

5. HISTORY. 

The order Scjuamata was first correctly delimited by Merrem in 1820,^ 
who included in it only the Sauria and Ophidia. The name was pro- 
posed by OppeP in 1811, but he included in it the crocodiles. The 
character viewed by these authors as definitive was the possession of 
tegumentary scales, in contrast to the osseous carapace of the Testudi- 
nata. They were unacquainted with the various anatomical characters 
which distinguish the order from all others. The Sauria and Ophidia 
were regarded as orders by other authors, including Dumeril, in accord- 
ance with the system of Brcmgniart (1799). 

The first author to define the Squamata by anatomical characters

was Latreille. In 1825, in bis Families Natiirelles du Regue Animal, 
he separated the Squamata, under the name Squamosa, from the tor- 
toises and crocodiles, on account of the slight fixity of the quadrate 
bone, the double male intromittent organs, and the structure of the 
feet. He was followed in this after a long interval by Stannius, who 
in 1856 reviewed the Squamata under the name of Strep tostylica,' 
including in it the two orders Sauria and Ophidia. I adopted this 
name as that of a superorder in 1871,^ including in it the Sauria and 
Ophidia, and a third order, the Pythonomorpha, which I had already 
proijosed in 1869 for the mosasauroid reptiles. This arrangement was 
retained in a synopsis of the families of Vertebrata published in 1889,^ 
except that the term Squamata was employed instead of Streptostylica, 
and was applied to an order instead of a superorder. This arrangement 
is continued in the present work. Dr. Boulengcr has adopted this 
system, but added the chameleons, or Rhiptoglossa, to the list of orders, 
increasing the number to four. This change is not adopted in the pres- 
ent work. The solidarity of the order Squamata is attested by the 
reproductive system as well as by the osseous, and especially by the 
characters of the male intromittent organ, as I have recently pointed out. 

SAURIA. 
I. ANATOMY. 

1. OSTEOLOGY. 

The following summary of the osteology of the Sauria is based on 
examinations of the specimens contained in most of the museums of 
Europe and of this country. For North American forms I am princi- 
pally indebted to the United States National Museum, my private 
collection, and that of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadel- 
phia. The characters observed during my study of material in Europe, 
which I found to be of the greatest taxonomic importance, I enumerated 
in a paper which is printed in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia 
Academy for 1864, p. 224. The use then made of those characters has 
been generally accepted by subsequent writers.^ There are, however, 
many other characters whose value is of uncertain taxonomic value, 
which were not then mentioned, and which I now record. 

The first description of the osteology of the Sauria is that of Cuvier, 
which is contained in his Ossemens Fossiles.'' This is an excellent 
one, but the many types discovered since his time render it neces-

sary that a new survey of the subject shouUl be made. In 185G the 
Zootomie der Amphibien, by Stanuius, appeared. The account of the 
osteology of lizards given in this work is more complete than that of 
Cuvier, but it is incomplete in many jjoints, and is not up to the require- 
ments of the present time. The present study is made with especial 
reference to the necessities of the paleontology of the order, therefore 
the description of characters is made as specific as jiossible. The 
principal novelty will be found in the references to North American 
genera and in the descrii)tions of the hyoid aj^paratus. The descrip- 
tion of the scapular and pelvic arches in certain genera with the 
extremities degenerate or wanting, where they have not been previ- 
ously described, is contained in a separate illustrated paper, which has 
been published.' 

Skull. — The premaxillary bone is single, except in the Scincidte, Acon- 
tiida^ and some Geckonidse {Phyllurus sp.). It is very small in the 
Iguanid genus Phrynosoma, and in the Agamidie it is excluded from 
contact with the vomer by processes of the maxillaries, which meet ou 
the middle line. In the Chama'leouidfie the premaxillary is still smaller, 
the body being narrower than the superior spine, and sui)porting but 
one tooth. In the Anguidae the premaxillary is bounded posteriorly 
on each side by a foramen which is sometimes large, but is wanting 
in other families, including the Helodermidte. In Lcpidostermim it is 
principally on the inferior face of the muzzle. The nasal bones are gen- 
erally distinct, but in the Yaranidie they are fused into a single nar- 
row median element. In the ChamaBleonidtii they do not attain the 
nasal border, being cut off by the junction of the prefrontal with the 
premaxillary and maxillary bones. In the genus Feylinia the nasal 
bones are fused into a broad plate. In Lejndostenmm they are com- 
pletely cut oft' from the nasal border by the maxillary, which is broadly 
in contact with the i^remaxillary spine. In RMneiira the nasal bone 
reaches the nares, as in AmphLshcena. The frontal bones are separate 
in the Yaranidii^, Helodermid.e, Anguidjii, Scincid;e, Anelytropsidoe, 
Anniellidrt', and Ami)hisbienida', and in some GeckonidiB. They are 
coossified in some Geciionidiej in the Iguanidte, Agamidai, Xenosau- 
rida), Eublepharid;c, Chamadeonidie, and Teiida*. The parietals are 
generally fused, the only exception being the Geckonidie, Uroplatidae, 
and Xantusiidu'. Prefrontals are always present, and in Anniellida.', 
Helodermida', and Gliamadeonidai they extend posteriorly to the post- 
froutals, excluding the frontal from the orbital border. Lachrymals 
are i)res(Mit, but tliey are fused with the prefrontal in the Scincidie. 
The jugal is generally present, even when there is no postorbital arch, 
as in Geckonida^, where it is a splint; but in the Amphisbania, 
Annielloidea, and in Feylinia, the splint-like element attached to the 
maxillary extends to the pterygoid posteriorly and the prefrontal 
anteriorly, and may include the lachrymal. The jugal extends ante- 
riorly as far as the lachrymal except in the Sciucidai. The postfrontal

184 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

is wanting and in most cases is fused with the postorbital in the 
VaranidjE and Agamidjc; but in other families it is distinct, with 
sporadic cases of fusion, as in Cnemidophorus. Superciliary bones 
are present in Yaranus, Phrynosoma, and several genera of Agamidte. 
They belong to the tegumentary system, and articulate the anterior 
with the prefrontal, the posterior (absent in Varanus) with the post- 
frontorbital bone. The sujoraoccipital is undivided and forms the 
superior part of the edge of tlie foramen magnum. Its anterior bor- 
der is generally loosely articulated with the parietal, joining it by 
a rudimental or developed median gomphosis with the supraoccipital 
process. It is generally overhung by the parietal, always so when 
the parietoquadrate arches are present. It is entirely overroofed by 
tlie i^arietal in the Xantusiid;e, the two elements being connected by a 
vertical laminiform septum. It is not overhung in the Annielloidea 
and Amphisba^nia, and in these the articulation is a firm complete 
transverse union. The parietoquadrate arch consists proximally of a 
process of the parietal, which is directed outward and posteriorly, 
which may represent the supramastoid element of the primitive Coty- 
losauria. Distally this process receives an ascending process of the 
paroccipital on its inferior aspect, sometimes anteriorly, sometimes pos- 
teriorly. This arch is shortened and depressed in the Anelytropsidse 
and is absent from the Anniellid;E and Amphisbflenia. In the Chamie- 
leonidfB it is differently composed, consisting of a superior i)Osterior 
process of the supratemporal, which rises upward and reaches the 
produced apex of the undivided parietal. The supratemporal is accom- 
panied for a short distance above the quadrate by the ascending 
l^rocess of the paroccipital. The pineal foramen is present in the 
Chama?leonid;B, Agamidfe, Iguanid;e, Anolidu^ Xenosauridte, Anguidie, 
Lacertida% Yaranidte, and Scincida\ It is wanting in the Helodermidiie, 
Eublepharida), Teiida^, Anniellidic, and in the Amphisbtenia. It perfo- 
rates the i)arietal bone clear of all sutures in most of the families, but 
it is near to or on the frontoparietal suture in Iguanid^e and Anolidne, 
and is in the frontal in Dipsosanrm and the Ohaimeleonidoe. The occi- 
pital condyle is compound, consisting of portions of the exoccipitals 
and basioccipital. In many genera these segments become so thor- 
oughly coossifled at maturity as to be undistinguishable. In some of 
the Geckonida) (as Geclw, Uroplates) the occipital segment is so reduced 
as to give the appearance of two condyles. In the Amphisba^nia the 
condyle is transverse and concave at the center, leaving the lateral 
portions iirominent. 

The postorbital bone when present sends a process posteriorly to the 
supratemporal, forming the supratemporal arch. In the genera without 
this arch the postorbital may be wanting, as in Heloderma, or be rudi- 
mental, as in Anniella. In the genera whose degeneration is advanced 
the supratemporal bone is appressed to the parietal, inclosing no 
foramen supratemporale, as in Feylinia. In limbless genera of Anguidfe

tbe supratemporal touches the parietal anterior to the paroccipital, thus 
reduciug the supratemporal foramen. This occurs also in Gerrhonotus, 
Celestus, Xenosaurus^ and Xantusiidie. In Heloderma tlie supratem- 
poral is a rudiment on the external side of the base of the paroccipital. 
The remarkable ujjward production of the supratemporal in Chamcc- 
leon has been mentioned. Here this process takes the place of the 
parietoquadrate arch. The exoccipitals are produced laterally, each 
embracing, with the petrosal in front, the small paroccipital. This sus- 
tains the suiDerior extremity of the quadrate. In the snake-like genera, 
as Feylinia, Anniella, and the Amphisbienia, this lateral elongation does 
not exist. The exoccipital is suake-like, and the quadrate is sessile on 
the side of the skull. The quadrate is generally convex at the upi)er part 
of its anterior face, and its external anterior border is produced outward 
so as to embrace a longitudinal concavity or conch, with the vertical mass 
or column of the bone. This column is itself more or less concave, its 
upper extremity being produced a little backward. In the Iguanidte 
there is another concavity, internal to the column, similar to the external. 
This is much narrowed in the majority of the families, and in the Yara- 
nidaj and Helodermidie, and in Phrynosoma, Uuhlepharisj-and Celestus 
it is wanting. In Chanueleon, Afmiella, and the Amphisbienia there is 
no external conch, the quadrate being simply a rod, while in Feylinia it 
is flattened in an anteroposterior plane. The mandibular articulation is 
more or less bilobate in all except Varanus, where it is j^lane. In Gecko 
the bilobation is strongly marked, as in the Permian Theriodouta. The 
pterygoid bones extend forward from the quadrates, with which they are 
in contact in all forms except Chamccleon, toward the middle line. This 
portion is generally grooved, but in Xenosaurns it is a slender rod. They 
are received on the basipterygoid processes of the sphenoid, and then 
diverge and assume a longitudinal position without meeting on the middle 
line. They are produced in an angle or process toward the posterior 
extremity of the maxillary bone, from which they are separated by the 
ectopterygoid. The i)tery golds then join the palatines. In a few genera 
they bear a few small teeth. The palatines are separate from each other 
and from the maxillaries, but send a process outward and forward to 
the latter. They join in front each its corresponding half of the vomer. 
The internal nares are situated each between the vomer and the maxil- 
lary, and it notches more or less deeply the palatine, which forms its 
posterior border. The vomers are separate in all forms excepting 
Chamccleon, and they have various I'orms. In Geckonid;e and Anolidiie 
they are flat and fit closely together, and they have the same character 
iu many Agamida3 and Iguanidte. In a few members of these families 
[Uromastix and SauromaJm) they are divided by a groove, which 
becomes a fissure posteriorly, which is the character in most other liz- 
ards. In the A^aranid;e each vomer is produced posteriorly on each side 
this fissure to a greater distance than in other forms. The j^lanes of 
the ijalate differ much iu dillerent families and groups. Thus, the vomer 



186 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

is ou a much higher phiue than the paUitiues iii Chamii'leouidai and 
Geckonidai, the palatines curving downward to meet the pterygoids. 
The latter are generally horizontal, but in Chamceleon they are in a sub- 
vertical plane, their free rounded extremities descending and fitting on 
the inner side of the mandible. They do not quite reach the quadrate. 
lu the Agamidai, lguanidiT3, and Geckonidte the internal extremity of 
the ectopterygoid is directed inferiorly, forming a downwardly directed 
angle ou each side of the palate. In the Amphisbseuia the structure of 
the palate is much more compact than in other lizards. The i^alatines 
are in contact on the middle line and there is no palatomaxillary fora- 
men. That is, the palatine is in close contact with the maxillary, the 
ectopterygoid being, tightly wedged in between them. The pterygoids 
are in contact throughout their length with the sphenoid, and the prox- 
imal end of each is tightly wedged between the latter ami the quadrate. 
The character of the petrosal must be attended to by anyone who 
desires to understand the relations of the Sauria among themselves. 
In no member of the Sauria is the trigeminus foramen closed ante- 
riorly by bony tissue, but it is inclosed by the membrane which forms 
the anterior wall of the brain case. The petrosal is divided into two 
parts by the deep notch whose fundus forms the j)Osterior border of this 
foramen, which may be called the supra and infra foraminal portions. 
The infraforaminal portion is divided in most of the families by a longi- 
tudinal, keel-like ridge, which forms the superior border of a groove 
whose inferior wall is formed by the sphenoid. This groove is not pres- 
ent in Heloderma and is very shallow in Xenosaurus. It is wanting in 
the Anuiellidie and Amphisbicnia. In the Geckonida; it does not exist, 
nor is the petrosal notched by the foramen, while the anterior border of 
the petrosal forms a free crest which extends from above downward and 
backward. In the Chamicleouidie, Agamidie, Iguanidae, and Anolidse 
(families with papillose tongues) the supraforaminal part of the petro- 
sal is short and is bounded by a convex anterior border which marks 
the position of the anterior semicircular canal. In the Nyctisaura, 
Thecaglossa, Dii^logiossa, Leptoglossa, and Amijhisbienia (families 
with smooth or squamous tongues, except Anniella, Dij)loglossa, and 
Nyctisaura) the i^etrosal is produced beyond this curved border below 
the parietal. In many forms an outline of the semicircular canal 
which forms the boundary in the other saperfamilies may be traced, 
whence I have termed this part of the petrosal posterior to it "the 
arched body" in my former system of the Sauria.^ The petrosal is 
produced farthest beyond this arcade in the snakelike forms of the 
Anniella and Amphisbienia, reaching almost to the orbit in Lepido- 
sternum. The relation to the parietal differs, the diflerences resulting 
from the greater or less redu(;tion of the primitive supratemporal roof 
and the greater or less entrance of the parietal into the lateral wall of 
the brain case. In most of the families it is little or not decurved to

CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 187 

meet the petrosal; and in the Iguania, where it is decurved, it does not 
come in contact with the petrosal, owing to the shortness of the latter. 
In certain families where the petrosal is x)rodiiced beyond the arcade, 
and the parietal is decurved, the two elements are in contact for a 
short distance, as in the Varanidte. In the Teiidaj and Scincid* the 
contact is mainly efl'ected by a short descending process of the parie- 
tal. This process is especially elongate in the Scincidfc. The arcade 
is the anterior border of the petrosal in the Permian Theriodouta, and 
it marks the position of the anterior semicircular canal. The membra- 
nous wall of the brain case, anterior to the petrosal, contains an ossifi- 
cation which is of uncertain homology. It reaches or approaches by its 
superior extremity the frontal, and might hence be supjjosed to be the 
orbitosphenoidj but this homology is vitiated by the fact that its infe- 
rior portion passes behind the optic foramen. The latter j)osition is 
that of the alisphenoid, and so the bone is named by Parker ^ But 
there is another element, the epipterygoid, posterior to it and immedi- 
ately anterior to the petrosal, which has been sui^posed to be the true 
alisphenoid. 

Leaving this question, and adopting for the bone in question the pro- 
visional name of postoptic, I remark that it is typically triradiate, send- 
ing two branches upward and one downward. This is its character 
in Agamidae, Yarauidie, and Teiidae. The posterior superior branch is 
much reduced in many Iguanid;T3 and Lacertidie and in some Agamidae 
{Megalochilus), and it is absolutely wanting in Gerrhosaurus and 
Ghamceleon. There is no postoptic in Heloclerma. In the Khynchoce- 
phalian genus SpJienodon these two elements coexist with an orbito- 
sphenoid, lying between the optic and trigeminal foramina. The two 
together may be homologous with the mammalian alisphenoid. The 
epipterygoid is present in all Lacertilia excepting the Ohamseleonidie 
and Annulati ( Amphisbaenia). Its superior connections are quite char- 
acteristic of the different families. Inferiorly it rests on the pterygoid 
posterior to its ectopterygoid process, excepting in the Geckonidae, 
where its point of attachment is opposite to that process. In the same 
family it does not reach the parietal, but the superior extremity rests 
on the apex of the supraforaminal part of the petrosal. In the remain- 
ing families there are three modes of superior attachment. In most of 
the Iguania and Acrodonta it reaches the parietal and does not touch 
tlie short petrosal. In the other superfamilies it is in contact with the 
] tetrosal. In the Varanidie, Helodermidie, and most Anguida? it reaches 
the parietal, which does not meet it with a conspicuous descending 
process. In Scincidu' and Teiid;^; a conspicuous descending process 
meets it. In a certain number of genera of various families it does not 
quite reach the parietal. Such are Eublepharidjie, Gerrhosaurid;^, 
Anguis, Lacerta, Phrynosoma (where it rests on the arcade of the

Ill Lyriocephalus and Phrynocephahis tlie epipterygoid is very short. 

The semicircular canals perforate the supraoccipital, the exoccipltal, 
and the petrosal. The internal is in a subtransverse vertical plane, 
causing a convexity on the internal side of the supra- and exoccipitals, 
and in some types a visible rib on the superoexterual suface of the 
same. The external canal is in a horizontal i)lane and perforates the 
base of the exoccipitopetrosal suspensorium, causing a horizontal rib 
on the anterior face of the latter in some forms. The anterior is in a. 
vertical anteroi^osterior plane, and perforates principally the petrosal, 
occupying its anterior border, which forms the " arcade" in most of the 
thick- tongued superorders, but crossing the bono much behind the 
anterior border in the slender- tongued superorders and the Diploglossa. 
The fenestra ovalis is tightly closed by the disk of the stapes, which is 
continued externally as the rodlike columella. This rod is slender 
except in Anniella^wheTe it is remarkably robust. In the other AmphiS' 
btenia its tympanic extremity is somewhat thickened. The columella 
is continued externally into a cartilage,which is more or less expanded 
in the vertico-transverse plane, the distal portion always so, forming a 
vertical lamina in contact with the tympanic membrane. This is the 
epistapedial cartilage. It is frequently produced upward beyond its 
point of attachment into a suprastapedial process. The plate thus 
formed is almost separate from the proximal axial part of the cartilage 
in Heloderma} The axial portion has a descending process, the infra- 
stapedial of Parker, in Lacerta, Seloderma, but not in Uuhlepharis, 
Thecadactylus, and Phyllodactylus. 

The rami of the lower jaw are united at the symphysis by ligament 
only. The angle is a prolongation of the articular bone; it is elongate 
and siini)le, except in Anniella and Ghamceleon, where it is absent. 
The angular bone never reaches the angle, and has an anterior posi- 
tion, being sometimes fused with the articular. The relations of the 
segments of the lower jaw are very characteristic in the divisions of 
the Sauria. The splenial bone is wanting in the Chamiiileonidre, 
and is very small in the Agamidie; in other families it is well devel- 
oped. The dentary extends posteriorly on the external face of the 
ramus, as the splenial diminishes, having the greatest posterior extent 
in the two families mentioned. The coronoid is differently extended in 
a similar ratio. Thus it is extended posteriorly on the external side of 
the ramus, aud not anteriorly, in the Chamieleonidne and Agamidte; 
both forward and backward in the Geckonida^; and forward in the 
other families. The angular is absent (fused with the articular, Bou- 
lenger) in the Geckonid;e, Auolidic, AcoiitiidiB, Anelytropsida', Anniel- 
lidse, and the Annulata, and is distinct in all other families. The 
articular and suraiigular are fused in several genera of Iguanidoij and 
there are but three bones in the ramus of Xantusiaj which see. The

augular extends well smteriorly ou the interior border of the jaw in this 
order, but is diftereutly developed ou the inner and outer faces. The 
Chanmeleonidte and Agamidic again show their similarity in having this 
element chiefly exposed ou the interior side, while in other types the 
exposure is external. The Meckeliau groove is open iu the Chamio- 
leonidne, Agamidiie, and Varanidie, but is roofed over more or less com- 
pletely in all other families. 

The hyoid system is not connected with the skull except in G-eckonidse, 
Eublepharida^, and Lepidophyma, so far as I have examined them. 
Thus in Thecadactylus, Phyllodactylus, and Euhlepliaris the ceratohyal 
is continuous with a cartilage which projects from the paroccipital 
above the posterior part of the auditory meatus. In Lepidopliynia the 
free epibranchial is attached to the inferior lateral angle of the basioc- 
cipital. In forty-two genera of other families enumerated below this 
is not the case. In no genus have I discovered any connection with 
the stapedial cartilages. The hyoid system in lizards consists of a 
glossohyal which is continuous with a basihyal tract, a hypohyal 
often continuous with the basihyal tract, a ceratohyal, a lirst cerato- 
branchial, and a second ceratobranchial which is always continuous 
with the basihyal tract. There may be in addition an epibranchial, which 
belongs to the first ceratobranchial. In some genera there is a free 
epibranchial, which may be then closely approximated to the ceratohyal 
{Eiimeces, Oligosoma, Gerrhonotus), or to the second ceratobranchial 
[Lacerta, Xantusia, Lepidophyma). The only constantly ossified ele- 
ment is the first ceratobranchial. The genera and families differ in the 
presence or absence of the second ceratobranchials and epibranchials, 
and the proximity or separation of the former. In general the Varanida?, 
Anguida', Zonurid<e, Gerrhosaurida^, Scincida^, Lacertida^, and Xantu- 
siidai have ei)ibranchials, while the thick-tongued and most degraded 
types are without them. In the Teiid* the hypobranchials are nuich 
produced anteriorly beyond the bases of the ceratohyals, and there 
are no second ceratobranchials. In Anguidse the hypobranchials are 
also greatly produced forward, but carry the ceratohyals with them. 
Ceratobranchials of the second pair are also wanting in Varanid;e, 
Ilelodermida', Chama^leonida^, Anguida), Anniellida^, and Rhineiira; 
PhyUodaetylus, Thecadactylus, and Geclio, among Geckoni;e; and ^^er- 
nia, and Gongylus in Sclncidse. Ceratohyals are wanting in Chamwleon, 
A)i()uis, Anniella, and Annulata generally. In both Agamidie and 
Iguanida) the second ceratobranchials are separated from each other 
iu the depressed genera of terrestrial habits, and in close contact with 
oach other in those of arboreal habits; but they are in close contact in 
CaUisaurus and Grotapliytus, both terrestrial genera. In Calotes, 
fguana, and Anolis they act as the rim on which the gular pouch or 
fan is stretched. The characters of Saurian hyoids may be tabulated 
as follows : Most of the genera referred to are figured in Plates 111 
to VI.

Vertebral column. — Except in the families of the GeckonidiB and 
Uroplatid.T, the vertebral centra are procnelous. In the families named 
they are amphica?lons. The zygosphen articulation is present in the 
Teiidae and the larger Iguanidse, including a rudiment in CrotaiJhytus. 
In smaller Iguanidse {Sceloporus, Phrynosoma) and in Sauria generally 
this kind of articulation is wanting. In a good many families the 
caudal vertebra? are divided by a transverse fissure or suture in front 
of the middle, which often splits the base and sometimes the length of 
the diapophysis. Such a structure is seen in Iguanidai {lgi(ana, Sauro- 
malus, Sceloporus, Dipsosaurus), Anolidai, Anguidse (Celestus), Teiidai 
{Tupinamhis, Cnemidophorus), Lacertidae {Lacerta), and Scincidae 
{Gongylus, Eumeces). In Dipsosaurus, Anolis, and Lacerta the neural 
spines of the caudal vertebra? are double; in the other genera named, 
single. In Varanidae, Helodermidse, Gerrhonotus, Grotaphytus, and 
Phrynosoma, the caudal centra are undivided, and the neural spines 
are single. In Ophisaurus the centra are undivided and the neural 
spines double. The centra are excessively thin in Ophisaurus, so that 
they break more readily than they disarticulate. There are two sacral 
vertebra except in genera with the posterior limbs rudimental or 
absent. In some of these, however, especially the degenerate genera 
of the Anguida", the rudimental ilium is attached to two diapophyses 
which join each other distally. 

Intercentra are present in the cervical and caudal regions in the 
latter, supporting the chevron bones. Besides the intercentra there 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 191 

are inferior i)rocesses of tlie cervical centra in some forms, tlie hypapo- 
physes of Owen. These have been confused with the- intercentra by 
Bouleuger, and have been renamed catapophyses by Baur.' 

The lirst dorsal vertebra is that one which is first connected with the 
sternum by a luemapophysis. In genera with a well-developed sternum 
the number of vertebrae anterior to the first dorsal is eight, except in 
the yara7ius niloHcus (Cuvier) and V. (/risens, where it is nine. In the 
extinct Dolichosauria of the Cretaceous period the cervical vertebrae 
are stated by Owen to number seventeen. 

The number of ribs attached to the sternum diminishes with the 
reduction of the limbs, from the normal of four on each side to one, and 
total disconnection. A common hsemapophysis or "xiphoid rod" suc- 
ceeds these on each side, which gives attachment to two separate hoema- 
pophyses for ribs. The common lijiemapophysis is a segmentation of 
the anterior part of the fifth ha^mapophysis, and it is not distinct 
in some genera, as, Sanromalus. In Heloderma the fifth haemapo- 
physis has no sternal segment or connection, and the sixth is want- 
ing. In Varanus the fourth, fifth, and sixth are wanting. In genera 
with the two appendicular hiemaijophyses they are closely appressed 
on the middle line in the majority of the genera, but in genera of 
depressed form they are separated, often widely. They are sei)arated 
in Steuodactylus guttatus, in rhyviaturus, Crotaphytus, and Sceloporus. 
They are more widely separated in Bipsosaurus, and most widely in 
Sauromalus and Phrynosoma. Cervical libs are present in varying 
numbers, and the posterior ones are generally (piite elongate. In cer- 
tain genera and families the ribs posterior to those attached to the 
sternum have their h;emapoi)hyses fused on the middle line below, thus 
constituting a series of abdominal ribs. In the Jguauid genus Scartis- 
ens there are two such ribs. In the Auolidw there are four and five 
pairs; in the Polychroine Iguanidse there are seven to ten. In the 
Chama^leonida^ and Geckonida* there are several pairs. The ribs of 
Ijcpidosterniim are remarkable for the presence of a capitular process 
which has no distinct capitular articulation. 

Scapular arch. — The clavicle is present in all the families except the 
Chamu'leonida", and in certain genera witli degerierate fore limbs. In 
such genera it is the last portion of the scapular arch to remain, and it 
is the only element present in FeyUnia (Anelytropsidte). It is always 
osseous. The form of its proximal extremity varies in the different 
families. It is simple in the Nyctisaura, Uroplatoidea, Acrodonta, 
Iguania, Diploglossa, and Thecaglossa, and expanded and generally 
perforate in the other superfamilies where present, except in some 
degenerate genera where it is simple (see Plate II, fig. 2). In Tracliy- 
mnruH and Cophias its proximal end is dilated, but not perforate. The 
scapula varies in form from elongate to short and wide. It presents a 

'Proceedings, U. S. National Museum, XVII, 1891, p. 351. 



192 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

pioscapular process in many families aud genera. It is present in 
Ignania and JSTyctisaura, in the last named often decurved and acumi- 
nate, and in Lophuraj in Acrodonta. It is present among Leptoglossa 
in Cnemidophorus, and in some Ameivie, while in other Ameiv;e it is 
wanting. It is wanting generally in Acrodonta, Diploglossa, Theca- 
giossa, and Leptoglossa, but it is present in Gelestus striatus. It is 
wanting in Rhiptoglossa. The coracoid is extended anteriorly to the 
sternum, and it is generally deeply emarginate on its anterior interior 
border. These emarginations are closed by the procoracoid, which 
extends to the middle line, aud is only partially or not at all ossilied. 
There are two coracoid emarginations in most Iguania, exceptions being 
the terrestrial genera JJrocentrum, Scelo])orics, and Phrynosoma, and 
the Anolid.e. There are also two iu Varanidie and Teiidie. The Aga- 
midaj generally have but one, but TJromastix is an excei)tion. There 
is but one in Auguidte and Scincidae (two in Tiliqua), and none in Helo- 
dermidai and Cham?eleonidai. 

The iuterclavicle is a very characteristic element in the Sauria. 
It is wanting iu Chanutleonidie and in some genera with fore limbs 
rudimental or absent. It is a simple splint in Helodermidie and some 
degenerate genera. In other families it has a transverse limb on each 
side, which maybe anterior, producing the "anchor-shaped" form, or 
median, producing the "cruciform" type. It is anchor shaped in Acro- 
donta, Iguania, and Thecaglossa, aud cruciform in Dijdoglossa and 
Leptoglossa. In Nyctisaura it is cruciform, with the lateral processes 
wide at the base. The sternum is a broad subrhombic plate which 
articulates by its anterolateral borders with the precoracoid and cora- 
coid, and by its posterolateral borders with the ribs. In genera with 
well-developed limbs its principal differences are seen in the nature of 
its fontanelles when present. In the Agamid* there are two, aud in 
most Iguauid;e there is one. Exceptions are the genera Polychrus 
jSauromalus, and DipsosaurKs, where there is no fontauelle. There is 
none in the Anolida3. In Teiid* and Lacertidju it is present, but in Scin- 
cidpe it is mostly absent, exceptions being the North American species 
of Eumeces. The fontauelle is wanting in Geckonida^, Diploglossa, 
Helodermatoidea, Thecaglossa, and Leptoglossa, with the exceptions 
above noted. The single median fontauelle is frequently concealed by 
the median limb of the iuterclavicle. It is nearly divided in some spe- 
cies of tSceloporus. 

The pelvic arch. — It is characteristic of the Sauria that the ilium 
is directed upward and posteriorly, and that the obturator foramina 
are well developed. The latter are only separated from each other by 
ligament or cartilage, which may sometimes contain some lime salt. It 
is produced posterior to the ischia in a triangular process, aud less 
frequently into a similar one in front of the pubic symphysis. The 
pubic foramen is always present. The pectineal process is present 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 193 

except in Geckonidie, but it is rudimeutal in some forms, as Phrynosoma. 
The following- table shows the forms of the pubis in twenty- three genera 
of different families : 

I. Pubes uniting at an acute angle. 

1. Pectineal process anterior Chamaleon. 

2. Pectineal process median Calotes, Draco, 

Iguana, Dipsoaaurus, Anolis, 

Gerrhonotus, 

Tupinamhiit, Cnemidopliorus. 

3. Pectineal process near acetabulum Scincus, 

Lacerta, 
Eumeces (rudimental). 

4. No pectineal process Gonyocephalns. 

II. Pubes uniting at an obtuse or very open angle. 

1. Pectineal process median Iguana, Cyclura, Crotaphytus, 

Histiiiriis. 

2. Pectineal process near acetabulum Jgama, 

rhrynosoma, Sauromalus, Sceloporus, 

Heloderma , 

Varanus. 

3. Pectineal process uone Gecko {Phrynosoma, rudiment). 

There is a tuber ischii in all of the genera which have come under my 
observation except Varanus. In Heloderma and some other forms it is 
small. 

The anterior limb. — The humerus is much alike in all Sauria, Chamce- 
leon only presenting peculiarities. The proximal end is expanded 
nearly in one plane, and the middle portion of the flattened extremity 
forms the oval head. This is not distinctly isolated, except by the pres- 
ence of articular surface, from the greater and lesser tuberosities which 
occupy the angles of the expansion. The shaft betrays no twist. The 
distal end is chiefly occupied by the condyles; but there are epicou- 
dyles, of which the internal is the more prominent, except in Cha- 
ma'leon, where they are wanting. The condyles consist of an external 
rib and a medio-internal roller, which is generally bounded at the 
internal extremity by a tuberosity, which is, however, wanting in 
Chanmleon. The ulna articulates with the median roller, its external 
edge being beveled by the external rib. The head of the radius articu- 
lates with the external rib, having shifted from its primitive position 
on the inner side. It results from this that in pronation the radius 
crosses the ulna. There is a short olecranon, except in Ghamwleon. 
The ulna and radius have about an equal share in the carpal articula- 
tion, sometimes the ulna a little the greater. 

The constitution of the carpus is very uniform in Sauria, with 
developed anterior limbs, the principal diversity being displayed by 
the Chamffileonidiie. In all, we have in the proximal row three distinct 
elements — the radiale, intermedium, and uluare (= pisiforme), the lat- 
ter mainly external to the ulna and directed posteriorly. Distal to the 
radiale and intermedium, and between them and the carpalia of the

194 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

second row, is a single small ceutrale. There are five carpalia, each 
corresponding to a metacarpal. I have failed to find in any of the 
genera at my disposal any of the carpalia fused together or wanting. 
In Chamcvleon, on the contrary, Cuvier has shown that there is no 
ulnare, and that the centrale and carpalia are fused into a single round 
median piece, to which the metacarpals are articulated. In all the 
normal Sauria the tendons of the flexors of the digits are combined 
on the palm, and the point of junction is occupied by a large flat sesa- 
moid bone. The number of j)halanges is also remarkably uniform. 
They number in each digit, commencing with the pollex, 2-3-4-5-3. 
The sole exception in the genera with well-develoj)ed extremities is 
Chamwleon, where the numbers are 2-3-4-4-3. This genus differs also 
from other forms in the shai)es of the metacarpals. Normally they are 
cylindric and subparallel in i)osition and united in a common integu- 
ment; but in Chama'leon they are flattened, with expanded extremities, 
and divided into two bundles by a fissure, three within and two with- 
out, enabling the three inner digits to oppose the two outer round a 
branch of a tree. The number of digits in Sauria is normally 5-5, 
but reductions take place presenting variations from 4-5 to 1-1, the 
posterior limb usually displaying a lesser degree of degeneracy than 
the anterior, although not always. 

Posterior limb. — The femur differs from the humerus in having a dis- 
tinct head, which is marked off from a trochanter. The former is not 
hemispherical as in Mammalia, but is somewhat compressed, and is 
oval in section. The trochanter is on the inferior anterior side of the 
head, or iu the position of the little trochanter of the mammalian femur. 
There is no great trochanter nor third trochanter. The condyles of the 
femur are not as well defined as in the Mammalia, and the patellar 
groove is represented by a shallow concavity without lateral ridges. 
Patella none, with some exceptional rudiments, as, for example, in 
Varanus. In Chamcvleon all the prominent features of the femur are 
toned down, the trochanter being represented by a ridge. The fibula 
is more slender than the tibia, and is larger distally than proximally, 
the reverse of what obtains in the tibia. The latter has no crest. 

Like the carpus, the tarsus is very uniform in the Sauria, the sole 
important modification being exhibited by the Chamicleonidie. There 
are two fused proximal elements, which are i^robably tibiale-intermedium 
and fibulare. They are only distinct in Heloderma among North Amer- 
ican genera, but a trace of the suture is seen in Varanus. In most 
Sauria there is then but one bone of the i^roximal row, which is flat 
and wider than long. No centrale, and but two tarsalia, the third and 
fourth, the latter much the larger. The second metatarsal i^rojects 
alongside of t. iii, so as to approximate the tibiale; its head is figured 
by Cuvier as a distinct bone, but he does not describe it as such. In 
Chamwhon there is a single proximal tarsal element, which is not flat- 
tened as in other lizards, and this articulates with a single subglobular 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 105 

tarsale, from wliich the metatarsals radiate.' The phahiiiges number, 
like those of the anterior foot, 2-3-4-5-3, iu ordinary Sauria, and 
2-3-4-4-3 in Chamieleonid;e. 

2. DIGESTIVE SYSTEM. 

The alimentary canal in the Sauria is not very highly specialized into 
distinct regions. There can always be distinguished stomach and 
small and large intestines, the former by its muscular walls and the 
intestines by their respectively dift'erent diameters. The stomach is 
always simple, and is curved to the right at the pylorus, though iu 
some of the serpentiform genera the curve is very slight. The small 
intestine forms a sigmoid which forms a loop cephalad just distad of 
the liver. This sigmoid is rarely simple, but is generally plicated, fre- 
quently highly so. The large intestine may or may not be distinguished 
into colon and rectum. The latter is constricted off at its extremity 
from a cloaca, wiiich has common orifice with a short common genital 
chamber immediately above it, into which enter the oviducts, usually 
at the extremity of two papillae. 

The liver is not subdivided except at its distal border. Its form 
differs in the different superfamilies and families, and it is more elon- 
gate and originates further posterior to the heart in the serpentiform 
genera in each. The gall-bladder is always situated at or within its 
posterior border, and not at a distance from it. Sjileeu and pancreas 
present. 

3. CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. 

The heart is not situated far posteriorly in any form, not even iu the 
serpentiform. There is sometimes a second anterior aorta bow in front 
of the usual aorta root. A carofis communis issuing from the right 
aorta root. Anterior abdominal vein joining the renalis revehens near 
the posterior border of the liver, and forming with the portal vein the 
posterior cava. This vein passes through the liver, receiving numer- 
ous heiiatic veins. Two anterior cardinals (jugulars) enter the sinus 
venosus with the posterior cava. 

4. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. 

The Sauria have two lungs, excepting the Annulati, which have but 
one. These are situated behind and on each side of the alimentary 
canal opposite to that portion which immediately follows the heart, 
excepting in the Annulati, where the lung lies ventrad of the alimen- 
tary canal for part of its length at least. Trachea with or without 

' Cuvier (Ossemens Fossiles, ed. 1836, p. 98) describes a distinct tibialo and fibulare 
iu Chamaleon, and figures them (pi. 245, fig. 52). These are not represented by Bou- 
lenger ( Proc. Zool. Soc, London, 1891, p. 118). They are, in fact, not distinct tarsal 
elements, but are the epiphysis of the tibia and fibula, such as exist also in Heloderma 
and other genera. The tihiale and lihulare are fused into a single clement as in 
other Sauriaus. 



196 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

bronchi, which, when present, are usually very short, but are elongate 
in the Thecaglossa. Laryngeal cartilages only specialized as to the 
terminal one which forms a pair of shell-like arytenoids, which bound 
the rima glottidis. 

5. UROGENITAL, SYSTEM. 

Testes single, situate well anterior to the cloaca. Ovaries occupying 
a corresponding position. Oviducts transversely plicate when empty, 
with nonplicate borders, and with fontanelle a little anterior to position 
of ovaries; orifice into vagina small; vasa deferentia convolute, adher- 
ent to kidneys. Kidneys posterior, symmetrical; ureters short. Uri- 
nary bladder generally present, but rudimental in some and absent in 
a few forms, as, for instance, the Teiidse. 

The male iutromittent organ or hemipenis presents much variety of 
structure, showing some parallels to the corresponding part in the 
snakes. It is, however, rarely spinous, as is so generally the case in the 
Ophidia, the only spinous forms being, so far as I have examined, the 
American Diploglossina? and genera allied to Cophias. The higher 
Sauria have the apical parts modified as in the Ophidia by the pres- 
ence of calyculi. Such are characteristic of the Ehiptoglossa and 
Pachyglossa. The Nyctisaura possess the same feature. The Diplo- 
glossa, Helodermatoidea, and Thecaglossa have the organ flounced, the 
flounces often pocketed or repand on the margin. In the Leptoglossa 
we have lamiuje only ; in the Teiidte mostly transverse, and in the 
Scincidse mostly longitudinal. In various genera terminal papillae are 
present. The organ may be simple or bifurcate, or merely bilobate. I 
have not met with the case so common in Ophidia where the sulcus 
spermaticus is bifurcate and the organ undivided. 

The structures of the hemipenis have a constant systematic value. 
As in the Ophidia, the value differs with the character, but it varies 
from generic to superfamily. 

6. TEaUMENTARY SYSTEM. 

This includes the dermal, the mucous, and the serous structures. I 
give attention to the serous or i)eritoueal membrane, which presents a 
considerable variety of structure among the Sauria. 

A fold suspends the alimentary canal from the median dorsal line forming the 
dorsal mesentery. No other mesenteries hind the canal, except the stomach, and 
sometimes an adjacent portion of the small intestines, which have other connections. 
The liver, on the other hand, has several mesenteric connections, as follows: Its 
ventral face has usually a single sheet connecting it with the median ventral line, 
but in rare instances it is bifurcate posteriorly (Trachysaurus), or even double 
(Tiliqua). This sheet, or, one of them, is continued along to the anterior abdominal 
artery to the ventral wall, and sometimes along the gall duct to the pyloric part of 
the small intestine. Each border of the liver is concave above, in adaptation to the 
lungs, in the types where they extend so far posteriorly, which is the usual arrange- 
ment. The median portion of the liver is concave above, usually in adaptation to the 
stomach. From the left-hand ridge thus produced a sheet or mesentery extends to 
the stomach, forming the gastrohepatic mesentery. From the right-hand superior 
angle a mesentery extends to the right dorsal body wall, forming the right hepatic 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES.

mesentery. The tliree mesenteries now described are the only ones which are 
universally present which bind the liver. Tlie following sheets are present in 
various types : Generally the right hepatic and the gastrohepatic give off sheets 
to the right and left lungs respectively, constituting the right hepatopulmonary and 
gastropulmonary mesenteries. A sheet occasionally goes off from the gastrohepatic 
to the left body wall, forming the left gastro-parietal mesentery. This is frequently 
represented by a narrow baud, and occasionally, as in Dipsosaurua, it joins the 
small intestine just beyond the extremity of the gastrohepatic sheet. This is not 
reijresented on the accompanying diagram. In Heloderma a distinct sheet extends 
from the left border of the liver to the left body wall, forming the left lateral hepatic 
mesentery. In Folyclirus and Anolis the left lung, instead of being attached to the 
gastrohepatic mesentery, is attached by a sheet to the left border of the liver, form- 
ing the left hepatopulmonary mesentery. In Varanus salvator there is a short median 
gastrohepatic sheet. In Varanus, owing to the anterior position of the lungs, they 
have no hepatic or gastric connections. In no Saurian have I observed a right 
hepatopulmonary sheet, as the right hepatic mesentery takes in the right lung in 
its course. The latter extends along the apical strip of the right lobe of the liver

to the genital mesentery in many genera. In Tupinamhis, Dracwna, and some others 
the right hepatic extends as a strong sheet to the right body wall, forming, with an 
equally strong gastroparietal of the left side, a kind of diaphragm. In many genera 
the right hepatic sheet is connected with the stomach, especially at its proximal part. 
Besides the hepatic and gastric mesenteries, there are those which inclose the 
internal genitalia, the urinary bladder, and the corpora adiposa. The genital 
mesentery is sometimes quite extensively free, and is always so anteriorly, espe- 
cially where it supports the wide fontanelle of the oviduct. There is no mesentery 
of the corpora adiposn, and a pouch only in those easels where those bodies project 
freely into the abdominal cavity, as is frefjuently the case. The cystic mesentery 
is a transverse fold of the peritoneum which lines the inferior wall of the pelvic 
cavity, and which incloses th(^ urinary bladder when it is present. 

The integument of the Sauria is divided into scales of a great 
variety of structure. Some of them are ossified, and in such cases are 
traversed by canals (Scincidfe). Others are produced into acute apices, 
which are ensheathed by a very hard epidermis, which becomes formi-

dable as a liorny weapou. Ou the posterior part of tlie inferior face of 
the thigh in many genera the scales of one or rarely two rows are 
deeply fossate, and tlie fossae are occupied by a waxy plug, which i)ro- 
jects beyond the general level. The use of this substance is uncertain, 
but it is probably an important aid to the animal in maintaining its 
hold on smooth surfaces. Lizards which move on the ground rest 
much on the thighs, which are not elevated above the ground in many 
types, but serve as the principal point of contact from which they make 
their leaps. The same is true of some genera which leap among trees 
from branches and trunks. A similar secretion issues from the i)reanal 
scales in some Iguanidie {Liolaemus, etc.), and in an African Lacertid 
a rudimental structure of this character is found ou many of the abdom- 
inal scales (Poroidogaster). An approximation to this structure I have 
seen on the preanal scales of an adult male of Sceloporus horridus of 
Mexico. Here the epidermis is greatly thickened above the middle 
posterior part of the scale, so much so as to make a deep impression 
in the true skin, simulating a true preanal "pore." I suspect that 
the nature of these structures is similar to that of corns in higher 
Vertebrata. 

When the tails of lizards are fractured a cartilaginous rod is devel 
oped from the centrum of the last vertebra remaining, on which muscles 
and integument appear. The scales are not similar to those of the 
normal tail, but resemble generally those of snakes, having a rhombic 
shape. Sometimes, as in various Scincida3 and Geckonidte, a series of 
transverse plates is developed on the under side, which does not exist in 
the normal tail. According to Boulenger the new scales in Lacertidte, 
Gerrhosauridie, and scinc-like Anguidse reproduce scales of the normal 
type. This author shows that in the Teiid genus Gynmophthalmus, 
which has scincoid scales, the reproduced scales of the new tail resem- 
ble those of the chalcidiform Teiida3, which are totally different. In 
Bopasia, which has Gerrhonotid scales, those of the reproduced tail are 
scincoid.^ 

Lizards which live in sandy deserts sometimes have the lateral scales 
of the digits produced into spines. These probably aid in securing a 
good foothold in the unstable surface. Such a structure appears in the 
Geckonid genus Ftenojnis, of South Africa, in the Agamid genus Phryno- 
cephahis, in Asia, and in the Iguanid genus Uma, in IsTorth America. 
This is an interesting example of homoplassy.^ 

7. NERVOUS SYSTEM. 

The brain of Sauria may be distinguished as to external form from 
that of the Ophidia by the less posterior expansion of the i)roseuceph- 
alon, the hemispheres having about the same width jiosteriorly as the 
mesencephalon. In the Ophidia the hemispheres spread laterally 
behind so as to be wider than the mesencephalon. The rhinencephalon

CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 11)9 

is generally much more elongate than in the Ophidia, each consisting 
of a slender peduncle and distal hollow bulb. In the genus Gongylius, 
and probably in other Scincidte, the olfactory process is not longer than 
in the Ophidia. The ventricles of the mesencephala are distinct from 
each other, and these bodies are also separate from each other, except 
at the base. Tlie cerebellum (epeucephalon) does not difter materially 
from that of the Ophidia excei)t in the case of the Geckonida>. In as 
many of the genera as have been examined this region is represented 
by two commissures covering the fourth ventricle instead of one, the 
usual number in vertebrata. 

The epiphysis is large in Sauria, while it is rudimental in Ophidia. 
It extends to the superior cranial wall, and its investing membrane is 
oppressed, tympanum-like, to the parietal foramen. Its superior expan- 
sion contains a varying amount of pigment, according to the type, and 
a layer of cells, forming a cup-like structure with concavity upward. 
This structure has been supposed to be au organ of special sense allied 
to sight. It is present in various conditions in most members of the 
Sauria, but is more or less rudimentary in all. In some forms there 
is no axial nervous connection with the brain. It is not unlilvely that 
this is a remnant of an organ of special sense which was functional in 
some of the extinct Reptilia. There is a very large parietal foramen in 
the Plesiosauridic, and 1 have found it still larger in the Permian 
Cotylosaurian family of the Diadectidae. In a number of Eeptilia a 
similar median body has been discovered close by the epiphysis — the 
parepipliysis. It resembles the former, but is more rudimental. 

The sacculus endolymphaticus of the internal ear sends upward a 
branch, which differs in its extent in the different famihes. In the Geck- 
onidte it extends to the neck and terminates in a sac on either side 
behind the auditory meatus. This sac is tilled with a mass of lime 
salt similar to that which composes the otolites. This protuberance on 
the neck of these reptiles has excited not a little curiosit}', and this 
feeling is rather stimulated than allayed by the knowledge of its 
direct connection with the organ of hearing. 

II. SYSTEMATIC RELATIONS. 

From the center of multiplicity of forms of typical Sauria, we can 
pursue three series — one toward the serpents by Amphislxvna, one to 
the partially degraded type of the Geckos, and lastly through the 
highest or pachygloss series, to Ghamcvleon. 

In the first case, the prolonged development of the superior part of 
the proiitic is followed by a decurving of the parietal bcnxler, the closer 
attachment of the occipital sclerotome, and shortening of the supratera- 
poral and paroccipital. Finally the petrosal, with the pieces adjoining 
anteriorly, begin to restrict a foramen ovale, the orbitosphenoid is 
developed, and the articular and angular i)ieces of the mandible are 
represented by but one piece; the columella disappears. In the last 
direction, the petrosal is not elongate, nor is there any tendency toward 



200 REPORT OF NA.TIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

a more complete closure of the cranial cavity. The inferior wing of the 
petrosal is directed inward instead of forward; the parietal fontanelle 
does not diminish, and the jiremaxillary bone is seen to form a regu- 
larly decreasing series. The interclavicle and columella diminish in 
length and disappear, and the splenial becomes smaller and smaller to 
extinction. The subarticular strengthens the inner rather than the 
outer wall of the mandible, and the external direction of the coronoid 
is reversed. 

In approaching the Geckos, the bones of the palate are seen to be 
thinner and more expanded, and the articular piece of the mandible is 
lost. In the fnll type the ossification is of the lightest description, and 
the fascial and basement membranes often present incomplete deposits 
of bony tissue; thus the parietal and sternal fontanelles disappear. 
The parietals are not, as usual, united, and there is a diminution (in 
Vroplates nearly obliteration), of the median or basilar segment of the 
occipital condyle. There is a temi^oral ala peculiar to this suborder. 

The following is a synopsis of the prevailing characters of the 
suborders. 

The arrangement adopted in this work is in general that of my sys- 
tem published in 1864,^ but I have subordinated the divisions some- 
what differently. This consists chiefly in distributing the divisions of 
the group I then proposed under the name of Pleurodonta, and regard- 
ing them as of equal rank with the other three primary suborders — 
Pachyglossa, Nyctisaura, and Opheosauri. This distribution estab- 
lishes five additional suborders, and two new ones are added, the 
Geccovarani and the Anguisauri. The former of these is based on char- 
acters brought out by Bouleuger in his essay on the classification of 
the Sauria,^ the latter is made necessary by a different estimation of 
the characters I described in the memoir above mentioned. The num- 
ber of suborders is thus eleven, and the families they embrace number 
twenty-two. For the characters of five of these families I am indebted 
largely to Boulenger. 

As elsewhere, the orders and families of Sauria can not be arranged 
in a linear series. There are three lines whose terminal groups are the 
Chamicleontidje, the Geckonidne, and the Scincidie respectively, and 
between these most of the families can be arranged. The suborders 
and families are as follows: 

I. Petrosal not produced anterior to semicircular canal and not articulating above 
with the parietal; olfactory lobes not nnderarched. Heniiponis 
mostly calyculate. 

Digits, including metapodials, in opposing groups of two and three about a ceu- 
trale carpi and tarsi respectively ; tongue papillose, extremity 
sheathed ; no clavicles Rhiptoglossa. 

Digits all directed forward ; clavicles proximally simple; interclavicle anchor- 
shaped ; tongue papillose, not sheathed Pachyglossa.

The extiuct family of the Dolicliosauridse probably represents another 
super-family, but its characters are not well known. It is so far only 
known from the Cretaceous bed of Europe. The genus DoUchosaurus 
(Owen) is remarkable for the large number of cervical vertebrai, there 
being not less than seventeen in the series. 

III. PHYLOGENETIG KELATIONS. 

The degradational tendencies of the Sauria have been already re- 
ferred to, as especially exhibited in the reduction of the limbs. This 
has been associated with a close adhesion to a life on the ground, and 
ultimately with a life beneath the surface of the ground. Goincident- 
ally with this habit there has taken place a reduction in the eflficiency 
of the sense of sight. The eyelids have disappeared and the ejiidermis 
has become thickened over the cornea, and has ultiinately assumed the 
character of the eindermis of the other parts of the head and body. 
The corium has in some cases closed over the orbit, so that total blind- 
ness has resulted. 

These reductions are seen least in families and genera of arboreal 
habits. No member of the Ehiptoglossa, Nyctisaura, Acrodonta, or 
Iguania displays any of them. They are first seen to a limited degree 
ill the Diploglossa, while they are very common in the Leptoglossa, and 
universal in the Typhlophthalmi and Amphisbnenia. I give the follow- 
ing table which displays at once the degradational series of the limbs 
in the respective families in which it occurs. 1 also include some fusions 
of cephalic dermal plates.

204 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Comparison of Diploglossa. — The degeneracy in this series is tolerably 
consistent in the order of its progress. In none of the genera are fore 
limbs present, and in three of them hind limbs are present. Notwith- 
standing the universal absence of fore limbs, a scapular arch is always 
present. This region shows, however, successive stages of degeneracy, 
as follows: In the three genera without posterior limbs the sternum 
has costal articulations; in the other three, none. In the genera with 
costal articulations the number of the latter diminishes regularly: in 
Mancus, three; in Opheodes, two; in Pygopus, one. Of the three genera 
with costal articulations, the iuterclavicle is present in two; in one 
{Pygopus) it is wanting. In the other genera it is present in a much 
modified form and position in one genus {OpMsaurus). Clavicles and 
coracoids are osseous in all of them; but the procoracoid is osseous in 
only two genera ( Opheodes and Pygopus) ; while in the third genus with 
costal articulations {Mancus) it is cartilaginous, as in the genera with- 
out costals. The genera with costal articulations are also the only ones 
with osseous scai^ula. So we observe a certain order in the loss of 
parts. Thus, the part to disappear first is the iuterclavicle (to reaj^pear 
in OpMsaurns) ; second, costal articulations and osseous scapula; third, 
sternum, which diminishes in size until greatly reduced, as in Anguis 
and Dopasia. 

As regards the i)elvic arch, reduction of its elements precedes the loss 
of limbs. Thus, Mancus is the only genus where the pubis and ischium 
meet (or in the ischium, are connected by an osseous hypogastroid) on 
the middle line. In Opheodes, where the posterior limbs are much 
as in Mancus, these elements are separated below the pubes widely. 
In Pygopus, where the limbs are better developed than in either, the 
inferior pelvic elements are rudimental and widely separated, being 
merely processes of the ilium. In the genera without limbs ( OpMsau- 
rus with a minute rudiment) this reduction is carried still farther, the 
inferior elements not being distinguished from each other or from the 
ilium, the entire arch having a lateral ijosition. Miiller remarks of 
these parts in Pseudopus, OpMsaurus, and Anguis, that they are "zwar 
sehr iihnlich." The order of degeneracy, then, in the pelvic append- 
ages in the Diploglossa, is, first, reduction of inferior j)ieces; second, 
loss of limbs; third, fusion of all the elements into a single lateral bone. 

Comparison of the Leptoglossa. — In Chalcides we have nearly normal 
scapular and i)elvic arches, while the limbs are very much reduced, 
though not to be termed rudimental. In the next stage of reduction, 
where all the limbs are present, but rudimental, the two arches show a 
considerable degradation, which is more marked in the scapular than 
in the pelvic. The pelvic elements remain much as in Chalcides, but 
reduced in size merely. In the scapular arch the sternum loses two 
costals, and the iuterclavicle loses the transverse processes. The clavi- 
cles become simple, and the ossification of the scapula and coracoid is 
reduced in extent. In Propus, where the fore limbs are much as in 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 205 

Evesia, while the hind limbs have disappeared, the scapular arch has 
many points in common with Uve.sia. Thus, the clavicle and interclavi- 
cle are simple, and the sternum has only two costals. The scapular 
and clavicle are much better ossified. On the other hand, the pelvic 
arch displays a great reduction. In Anelyfropsis, appropriately to the 
absence of fore limbs, there is no scapular arch. The pelvic arch is 
greatly reduced; but, curiously, there appears an element which resem- 
bles a corresponding element in the snakes. This arrangement is quite 
dift'erent from anything observed in the other Leptoglossa or in the 
Diploglossa, but is not without parallel in other Sauria, to be described 
later on. 

The reduction of the scapular elements proceeds in the Leptoglossa 
on much the same lines as observed in the Diploglossa. The early sim- 
plification of the distal end of the clavicle is peculiar to the Leptoglossa 
as it is always simple in the Diploglossa. The late stages of reduction 
of the sternum seen in the limbless Diploglossa are not exhibited by 
any of the forms here described, although they probably exist, since 
we have the Anelytrojms, where the scapular arch is wanting. On the 
other hand, the extreme reduction of the pelvis seen in Propus^ where 
the ilium only remains, has not yet been observed in the Diploglossa 
without posterior limbs. 

Observations on Annulati. — The wide diversity between the pelvic 
structure in Chirotes, as compared with that of Amphishcena, emphasizes 
the evidence furnished by the scapular arch in favor of regarding it as 
representing a family distinct from the Amphisbteuidfe. Even with 
the pelvic elements of Ghirotes before us, it is difficult to be sure of 
the homology of the corresponding part in Amphishcena and Rhineura. 
It can only be one of the two inferior elements, or femur. Against the 
latter supposition, wliich is suggested by the structure of the Anely- 
tropidic, its anterior position is strong evidence. For the reason that 
it approximates closely the vent, its claim to be ischium is rather 
stronger than the supposition that it can be pubis. It is homologized 
by Fiirbringer with the iliopectineal bone of the snakes. 

General conclusions. — One conclusion is obvious, and this is that 
degeneracy of the scapular and pelvic arches follows degeneracy and 
loss of limbs, sooner or later. More special conclusions may be 
expressed as follows: 

I. Anterior limbs have disappeared more generally than the posterior 
in tlie Diploglossa. 

II. The limbs incline to degenerate and disappear more nea,r\y pari 
passu ill the Sciucida'. 

III. The anterior limbs have a tendency to persist longer in the Teiidai 
and Amphisb;enidie. Future research may not sustain this proposition. 

IV. The degeneracy in the scapular arch is delayed long after the 
degeneracy and loss of the anterior limbs. 

V. Degeneracy of the pelvic arch precedes the loss of the pelvic limb. 



206 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



VI. The Older of degeueracj' of the elements of the scapular arch is 
(l)limb; (2) iiiterclavicle (generally); (3) costal attachment; (4) sternum. 

VII. The order of disappearance of parts in the pelvis is (1) pubis 
and ischium together (generally; see Ampliishcena) ; (2) limb; (3) ilium. 

The conclusion that the rudimental condition of the arches and limbs 
is due to degeneracy is supported by paleontologic evidence, which 
shows that the ancestral orders of the Rej)tilia (Cotylosauria and 
Theromora) had well-developed limbs. Similar evidence shows that the 
Sauria and Ophidia had a common ancestor; but, as already remarked, 
whether that ancestor was a Theromor or a Ehynchocephal remains 
uncertain. 

Within the limits of the Sauria the series of affinities expresses in 
some degree the phylogenetic succession. We can express these in a 
tabular form as follows : 



Rhiptoglossa Nyctisaura Thecoglossa Leptoglossa Annul ATA 




Pachyglossa 



This phylogeny presupposes that the superfamilies in which the 
petrous bone extends in advance of the anterior semicircular canal are 
of later origin, or were derived from those, in which this is not the case. 
It must be borne in mind, however, that this difference is of very ancient 
origin, since in the Permian epoch the Cotylosauria have the petrous 
bone developed forward, and the Pelycosauria have it much abbre- 
viated. The Pythonomorpha of the Cretaceous also have the abbre- 
viated petrosal in strong contrast to the existing Thecoglossa, where 
it is produced. Nevertheless the Pachyglossa display such affinities in 
many directions that they are probably ancestral to the other super- 
families. The dentition of the Agamida^ is quite identical with that 
of many of the Rhynchocephalia, and with that of the Chameleons 
as well. It is a modification of the primitive rhizodont dentition which 
prevailed during the Permian. The pleurodont dentition is another 
modification which points to the Iguanid:e as the starting point of the 
families which also possess that type of dentition. 

The intermediary position of the Diploglossa between the thick and 
thin tongued lizards 1 pointed out in 1804, and its tendencies toward 
the Nyctisaura also are unmistakably seen in Xenosanrus. The Nycti- 
saura have degenerated in the characters of their vertebra?, for I do 
not believe this character to be of primitive origin, or to indicate that 
the superfamily is related to the Permian Pelycosauria, which have 
similar vertebrte. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 207 

The Ehiptoglossa (Chameleons) form an extremely specialized type, 
modified from the Agamid.e by loss of parts and modification of the 
feet. Their cranial characters are in some respects not a little like 
those of the Laramie Dinosauriau family of the Agathaumidie, but 
this resemblance does not indicate afBnity. Finally, the Amphisbseni- 
ans (Annulati) are a group of whose origin it is difficult to learn. They 
may have come oft" from the common ancestors of the Sauria and 
Ophidia, but their resemblances to the Annielloidea render it possible 
that their point of origin may have been later in the scale. Their den- 
tal types differ quite like those of the Pachyglossa, and it is therefore 
clear that they were not derived from a pleurodont type, but like the 
Pachyglossa developed a pleurodont type independently. The dis- 
covery by Baur of this superfamily in the American Oligocene shows 
it to have been contemporary with the Diploglossa, which I discovered 
in the same horizon. In any case the Annulati show a nearer tendency 
toward the Ophidia than any other group of the Sauria. 

IV. HISTORY. 

The suborder of Sauria was first correctly defined and distinguished 
from the other divisions of Eeptilia by Owen in 1841, under the name 
of Lacertilia. Previous to this date the division which included it was 
either too comprehensive oti account of the admission of the Loricata, 
or deficient by reason of the reference of the serpentiform lizards to the 
Ophidia. Indeed Laurenti in 1768 included lizards, crocodiles, and 
salamanders in a division which he termed Gradientia, for which reason 
this name is not available for any natural division of animals. Brog- 
niart in 1799 first proposed the term Sauria, but included the crocodiles, 
as did Daudin (1802), Dum«''ril (1800), and Oppel (1811). Merrem in 
1820 first separated the crocodiles from other reptiles under the name 
Loricata, and retained OppeFs name, Squamata, for the order as now 
generally adopted. The contents of the Squamata were, however, very 
incorrectly arranged and no progress was made in correctly distin- 
guishing the Sauria from the Ophidia. Wagler in 1830 included the 
scaled reptiles in three groups, Lacert;p, Serpentes, and Angues, 
excluding the crocodiles as Crocodili. The Angues includes both Sau- 
rian and Ophidian genera. 

In 1831 Dumeril and Bibron issued the first volume of the Erpeto- 
logie Generale. The crocodiles are included in the Sauria. In 1841 
Owen proposed a system of Keptilia based on studies of both the 
extinct and recent forms. Ue did not recognize the order Squamata, 
but regarded the lizards and snakes as representing orders, using the 
names Lacertilia and Ophidia. For the crocodiles he employed the 
name Crocodilia instead of the older Loricata. It was reserved 
for Johannes Miiller to distinguish more exactly than his predecessors 
the Sauria from tlie Ophidia, liis only error being the retention of the 
Amphisbjenia (Annulati) in the latter. He wrote in 1837, and employed 



208 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

the terms Sauria aud Ophidia for the two divisions. Stanuius iu 1856 
gave the first clear presentation of the contents of the Squamata in 
their natural relations. He embraced under the Sauria the three divi- 
sions, Amphisbienoidea, Kionocrania, and Ohamteleonida, which are 
the forms now generally included by authors in the suborder. 

As regards the contents of the suborder, Wiegmann first gave in 
the Herpetologia Mexicana an intelligible system based on structural 
characters. His work formed the basis of the later ones of Dumeril 
and Gray. The sharacters employed by these authors were, however, 
external. In 1864' the present writer published a synopsis of the 
osteological characters of the Sauria, and proposed a system based on 
them. I used the names given by previous authors for groups where, 
as is usually the case, the characters of the skeleton coincide with those 
indicated by the tegumentary structures and tongue. In 1896 I rein- 
forced these definitions by characters derived from the penial structures.^

Many other peculiarities characterize the lizards included in this 
superfamily, but they are not such as appear to me to characterize 
a division of such high rank, but to pertain rather to the definition of 
the single family which it includes. 

Some authors think that the Sauria should be primarily divided into 
three divisions : the Ohama^leonida (= Rhiptoglossa), Kionocrania (re- 
maining Sauria), and Amphisbicnia Boulenger divides the Squamata. 
into four primary divisions, of which the Rhiptoglossa forms one, and the 
others are the lizards, Pythonomorpha, and the snakes. These views 
are due to the importance attached to an aggregate of characters, each 
one of #hich can be shown to be of no wide systematic value in the 
Squamata. Thus the absence of epipterygoid characterizes forms not 
widely removed (some of the Leptoglossa) from those which possess it. 
The interclavicle is absent iu the chameleons, but it experiences great 
reduction to extinction in somo other groups. Other chat^acters will be 
mentioned under the family definition.

Boiilenger,' in enumerating these characters, includes "vomer sin- 
gle" and "a supratemporal bone presient'' as of such importance as to 
require their separation as a suborder. The character '^ vomer single" 
is, however, an error, as the "vomer" (= maxillopalatines) is paired as 
in other Sauria. What is here called vomer is the inferior spine of the 
premaxillary. The supratemporal is homologous with that found in 
nearly all other Sauria. 

But one family of Rhiptoglossa is known, as follows: 

Teeth uciodont — that is, rooted in alveoli and coossified with their walls; external 
nasal openings bounded by the prefrontal and maxillary bones only; no epiptery- 
goid; usual cranial arches present; vertebnB procoolous; a sternum; no inter- 
clavicle ; no osseous scales Cham/ELeonid^.

This family possesses numerous peculiar characters besides those of 
the superfamily to which it has been referred. Some of these are 
found also in the Agamidfe. They are as follows: 

Coronoid bone produced posteriorly on outside of ramus. 

Articular present; separate from angular. Splenial reduced, more 
frecjuently wanting. Subarticular small on outer, much prolonged on 
inner face of ramus. 

Groove from si)lenial to mental foramina not closed over Meckel's 
cartilage. 

Premaxillary nearly always separated from vomer by maxillaries. 

Pterygoids not touching body of sphenoid or reaching quadrate. 

Parietal single, receiving the gomphosis of loosely attached occipital 
segment internally. Frontals united. 

Sternum without fontanelle. 

ISTo angular process of mandible. 

Abdominal ribs present. 

The viscera present the following peculiarities : The observations are 
made on Chanuvhon hasiliscns and G.idaniceps. The liver is adjacent to 
the heart, and is compressed, so tliat the vertical diameter much exceeds 
the transverse. It is two lobed, the left lobe much smaller in every 
way than the right. The gall bladder is entirely posterior to, but 
adjacent to, the liver. The alimentary canal exhibits stomach, small

intestine, colon, and rectum. The small intestine is short and little 
plicate, and the colon is short and has a c;ecum. 

According- to Stannius, the lungs are digitate at the extremity and 
along the inner borders. Wiedersheim states that the proximal part 
of the lung is shortly divided longitudinally into three parts, each of 
which has a separate connection with the bronchus. 

The mesenteries include the usual hepato-ventral, epigastric, gastro- 
hepatic, and right hepatic, the last including the right lung. The left 
luug is included in a left hepatogastric, a feature seen in few other 
groups, notabl}^ as the Anoline Iguanida'. There is also a left hepato- 
lateral, from the liver to the left body wall, having a direction diagonal 
to the loug axis of the liver in G. basiliscus. 

The greater part of the surface of the hemipenis is coarsely calycu- 
late, generally in a transverse direction. There are remarkable papillae 
at the apex, which differ in the different forms. In the G. imrdaUs 
there is a kind of membranous apron proximad of the papillae, which 
presents an ap(;x proximad opposite to the sulcus spermaticus. In the 
G. vulgaris and G. gracilis the papill;ie are erect, laminiform, and trans- 
verse, and serrate on the edges. The principal pair have a few papillae 
in front of and behind them, and in the G. gracilis there is behind 
these, on each side, an oval body which is composed of three serrate 
laminte packed obli([uely together. In the G. gracilis the proximal 
laminie are low and have a margin of acute tubercles, and each serves 
as a collar to a much larger papilla. The latter is largely free and 
tongue-shaped, with the apex proximad, and its flat external surface is 
covered with three or four rows of conic papilla?. 

Bouleuger thus summarizes the general characters of the Chameleons: 

Tongue cylindrical, extremely extensile and projectile, sheathed at the base, club- 
shaped and viscous at the end, with au exceedingly elongate glossohyal bone. 

Tlie head usually forms a bony casque, ornate with crests or tubercles. The inter- 
orbital septum is present, and a sma 1 columella cranii distinguishable. (This is not 
the columella (epipterygoid), but the postoptic Cope.) Preniaxillary extremely 
small, edentulous (sometimes. C); orbit bony all around, the pre- and postfrontals 
often joining to form a supraorbital roof; a pair of snpranasal fontauelles, bordered 
by the nasals, the prefroutals, and the frontal; latter bone single; parietal fora- 
men, if present, pierced in the frontal; parietal single, often much narrowed and 
compressed, forming a crest, and meeting posteriorly the extremities of a pair of 
bones, the supratemporals, which on each side connect it with the scjuamosal. 
(This should be paroccipital. C.) In some species the parietal in the adult may be 
much expanded, and form a bony slab from which the supratemporals are no longer 
to be distinguished. Dentition acrodont; teeth compressed, triangular, more or less 
distinctly tricuspid. Palate toothless. Eyes large, covered by a thick granular lid 
pierced with a small central opening for the pupil. No tympanum. Body com- 
pressed; neck very short. VertebrjB proccjelian. Abdominal ribs present. Limbs 
long, raising the body. Digits arranged in bundles of two and three; in the hand . 
the inner bundle is formed of three, the outer of two digits; it is the reverse in the 
foot. Tail prehensile. Head and body covered with granules or tubercles. 

Physiologically as well as anatomically Cham;cleons stand by themselves among 
reptiles, as is evidenced by the mobility and independent action of their eyes, the 
projectility of their tongue, the slow and deliberate movement of their limbs. The

changeable hue of their skin, first noticed in them, is a i)eciili:irity shared 1)y many 
other lizards, and to an equal if not stronger degree by Calotcs. 

About one-half of the species occur in Madagascar and neighboring islan<ls, the 
other half in Africa; the common Chani;eIeon is Mediterranean, occurring in Europe, 
however, only in Andalusia; a species inhal)its Socotra, another South Arabia, and 
a third India and Ceylon.

Siebeurock ^ lias described the osteology of the Broolesia supercili- 
aris Kuhl, which he shows possesses a number of peculiarities which 
distinguish it from the species of the genus Chamwleon, and, in fact, 
from all known genera of Vertebrata. From the fourth cervical verte- 
bra to the eighteenth caudal, inclusive, the zygapophyses of each side 
are connected by a longitudinal osseous bar. This bar gives origin on 
the dorsal vertebrje to a transverse process which is above the true 
transverse process and more prominent. It is called by Siebeurock 
" accessorischer querer Fortsatz," which may be classicized into epidia- 
pophysis. Further, the prezygapophyses are connected by a bony arch 
which is fused on the middle line with the neural spine, on the dorsal 
vertebrae, from the second to the ninth, inclusive. In the cranium the 
frontal and parietal are greatly expanded. The former reaches the 
orbit, excluding the pre- and postfrontals. The parietal excludes 
the occipital from view when seen from above. There are teeth on the 
prem axillary bone. 

In the genus Ghamcvleon the prefrontals and postfrontals exclude the 
frontal from the orbit. The vertebra^ arc normal. 

In spite of the peculiarities of the Rhiptoglossa I supposed that they 
were derived from the Pachyglossa. Many of their characters are pres- 
ent in genera of the Agamidiii, leaving but few to be accounted for, as of 
later and separate origin. Of the latter kind are the peculiarities of 
the external nostrils, and metapodials. The characters of the premax- 
illary, mandibular composition and scapular arch are nearly approached 
or imitated by some of the Agamida*; and in some of the latter the 
epipterygoid becomes much abbreviated.

lous. Clavicle simple proximally. Interclavicle anchor-shaped. Pre- 
maxillary undivided. Parietal single, receiving the loosely articulated 
occipital inferiorly. Frontal not underarching olfactory lobes. Tongue 
papillose, the apex not retractile. 

As to the visceral anatomy, the following points are characteristic: 

Liver short and contracted proximally or seraipyriform, the posterior 
border more or less emarginate by one or sometimes two notches ; the 
right lobe more produced than the left, and terminating in a narrow 
strip which reaches the reproductive cells, (rail bladder partly exposed 
on the posterior margin. 

Alimentary canal* with stomach, small intestine, and rectum well 
distinguished, and also a short colon adjacent to the rectum, which 
frequently presents a short proximal csecum. Corpora adiposa free 
anteriorly. Kidneys posterior in position; a urinary bladder. Ven- 
tral mesentery extending to posterior border of liver and beyond it to 
a fold of the small intestine. 

This superfamily embraces the most vigorous branch of the order 
and includes the largest species, excepting the Thecaglossa. Its point 
of contact with the other superfamilies is through the Diploglossa, and 
especially the ZonuridjTe. In my iirst system of the Sauria I divided 
the Pachyglossa, as had been done by others, into two superfamilies, 
and associated one of them with the Chamseleonidie, and the other 
with the Lejitogloss and Diplogloss superfamilies. This was because I 
had discovered numerous osteological characters which appeared to 
justify this arrangement. It is, however, clear that, as various authors 
have shown, the ChamseleonidjTe represent a distinct superfamily. I 
am of the opinion also that the points of agreement which I have dis- 
covered in the anatomy of the acrodont and pleurodont divisions of 
the Pachyglossa are more important than the differences, and as these 
points are of the exact grade which define the superfamilies, I return 
to the system of Wagler and Pitzinger, pointing out at the same time 
the various osteological characters in which the pleurodont division 
agrees with other lizards and differs from the acrodont division. 

These two divisions or families differ as follows : 

Dentition acrodont; that is, the shanks of the teeth inclosed between two alveolar 
walls, with which they are frequently connate Agamid^. 

Dentition pleurodont ; that is, the shanks of the teeth attached laterally to the inner 
side of the single and external alveolar wall IGUANID^, 

In the Agamida3 the premaxillary bone is nearly always separated 
below posteriorly from the vomer by the intervention of the maxillaries. 
The coronoid bone is produced posteriorly and not anteriorly on the 
outside of the mandibular ramus. The splenial bone is of reduced 
size and is most frequently wanting; and the articular is much more 
developed on the inner than on the outer side of the ramus. The groove 
of Meckel's cartilage is not roofed over between the splenial and internal 
mental foramina. In all the above characters the Agamidae agree with 
the Chamneleonidte. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 213 

In the Iguauidpe, the premaxillary is very seldom sei)arated from the 
vomer on the palatal face. The coronoid bone is i)rodnced anteriorly 
and not posteriorly on the external face of the ramus. The splenial 
bone is well develo])ed, and the Meckelian is more or less roofed over. 
The angular bone is much more developed on the external than the 
internal face of the ramus. In these characters the IguanidsB agree 
with the majority of the Dijiloglossa and Leptoglossa. 

In neither family are the temporal fosste overroofed with ossification, 
nor do any of their members exhibit osteodermal plates. 

The Agamidse are restricted to the Old World. The Iguanidse inhabit 
the New World, Madagascar, and the Fiji Islands.

The following are some of the osteological characters of this family : 
Teeth in alveola, coossifled with them in adults (acrodont.) 
Premaxillary generally separated from maxillopalatines by maxilla- 
ries, small, undivided. 

Splenial small, or more frequently wanting; Meckelian groove open; 
angular and surangular distinct, the former small on outer, much pro- 
longed on inner face of ramus. Ooronoid produced posteriorly on 
external face of mandible. 

An examination of twelve genera of this family shows that the vis- 
ceral characters agree in general with those of the Iguanidte. The 
liver is bilobate posteriorly in Calotes and in Uromastix; more conspic- 
uously so in the latter, where the posterior border is deeply emargiuate. 
In Amphibolurus barhatus and MegaloehUus auritus the border is trilo- 
bate; in the former the middle lobe is more than usually distinct and 
lies superior to the right and left lobes. In these two species also the 
ventral mesentery is bifurcate to the. proximal end of the liver. In the 
A. barhatus the cystic mesentery is short, and the urinary bladder is 
rudimeutal. In MegaloehUus the small intestine is rather short. The

colon is generally present, and the caBcum is quite conspicuous in 
Draco, Stellio^ and Agama {aculeata), and less so but present in Lophura, 
Galotes, Uromastlr, and PhrynoGephalus. 

The mesenteries present the usual sheets, hepatoventral, gastrohep- 
atic, left gastropulmonary, right hepatic, which includes the right lung. 
I have noted the following modifications : In Agama colonorum the left 
gastropulmonary has become a right gastrohepatic by its continuing to 
the liver, a character observed in Ghamwleon and the Anolinae. There 
is also in this species a left hepatomarginal. In Megalochilus auritus 
there is a right hepatoventral, as in Phrynosoma, 

I have had the opportunity of examining the hemipenes of a rela- 
tively small number of species of this family. As already remarked, 
the surface is generally calyculate. I liave not found terminal papillae 
in the genera Uromastix, Agama, Liolepis, Physignathus, or Galotes. 
The general construction is, that opposite the sulcus spermaticus is a 
strong longitudinal welt. IS'ear the apex this welt becomes adherent to 
the side on which the sulcus runs, dividing the organ into two apical

portions. The sulcus bifurcates and i^asses along the base of this par- 
tition. In Liolepis there are two welts inclosing a smooth space 
between them. In Galotes oristatellus there is a lesser welt on each 
side of the ])rincipal one. In all the genera the basal part is smooth 
and it is sometimes thrown into longitudinal folds. 
Boulenger makes the following general remarks on the Agamidae : 

The cliief character by Avhich the lizards of this family are at ouce distinguished 
from their allies is the acrodont dentition. The teeth may usually be divided into 
three kiud.s, viz, incisors, canines, and molars. The latter iire more or less com- 
pressed, frequently tricuspid ; regular canine teeth are present, one or two on each 
Bide, in most of the gener.a; in Uroinastix and Aporoscelis, however, these enlarged 
teeth are absent, and the anterior lateral teeth wearing out with age, a toothless 
cutting edge is left between the molars and the incisors, which, in these two genera, 
unite in the adult to form a large single or divided cutting tooth. 

The skull is less depressed and more strongly ossified than in the preceding fam- 
ilies, and postorbital and postfronto-squamosal boue arches are well developed; ia 
Lyriocephalus, as in several Iguanoids, another arch is formed by processes of the 
pne and postfrontals which unite surrounding a large supraorbital fossa. The pre- 
maxillary is single, the nasals are double, and the frontal and parietal single; the 
pterygoids are usually widely separated and constantly toothless; the os trausver- 
sum is strongly developed; a columella crauii is present. Dermal ossifications on 
the skull are constantly absent. The fore limbs are well developed, and, except in 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 217 

SUnua, which hicks the outer toe, pontadactyle. The chivicle is not dilated, and 
the interchivicle is T-shaped or anchor-shaped, frequently small; the sternum usu- 
ally presents two fontanelles, which however, are missing in lAjHoceplialus and 
Moloch, the latter genus being especially remarkable for having the sternum divided 
longitudinally. 

The tympanum is either exposed or concealed under the skin. The eye is small 
and the pupil round ; eyelids well developed. The tongue is thick, entirely attached 
or slightly free in front, not, or but slightly, nicked anteriorly; it is more free, pro- 
tractile, and more distinctly incised in the herbivorous genera Lophura, TAolepia, 
and Uromasilx. 

Femoral and pricanal pores are absent in the majority of the genera; it is a remark- 
able fact that they exist, at least in the males, in all Australian genera but one 
{Clielosania, known .as yet from a unique specimen), whereas they are missing in 
all others except Uromastix and Liolepis. There are no sjaumetrical plates on the 
head or on the belly ; and ornamental appendages, such as crests, gular pouches, etc., 
are frequently present, either in the males only or in both sexes. The tail is usually 
long and not fragile; it is prehensile only in the genus Cophotis, and some Fhrynoce- 
phall have the curious faculty of curling upward the extremity of that organ. 




Fig. 15. 
AoAMm^. Liolepis bellii Gray. 

The digits are usually keeled inferiorly or denticulated laterally. The shape of the 
body as well as the scaling vary considerably, according to the genera, and in 
adaptation to the modes of life. Generally speaking, ground Agamoids have the 
body depressed, and arboreal compressed, but a division of the genera into terres- 
trial and arboreal, which has hitherto been almost generally accepted, must be given 
up as impracticable and unnatural. Most Agamoids are exclusively insectivorous; 
Lophura, Liolepis, and rromastix are herbi- or frugivorous, while some species of 
Jgama have a mixed diet ; again, a systematic division into insectivorous and herbiv- 
orous, as has been proposed by Theobald, would be as unsatisfactory as that into 
terrestrial and arboreal. 

Leaving out the strongly specialized genera Draco and Moloch, all the forms pass 
very gradually one into another in different directions, rendering a sharp generic 
division, and, still more, a serial arrangement, a matter of great difficulty. 

The Agamidio inhabit Africa, Asia, Australia, and Polynesia. They are most 
numerous in species as well as in genera in the Indian region. In Africa they are 
represented by only three genera, viz, Agama, AporosccUs, and in the northern parts, 
Uromastix. Four species extend slightly beyond the limits of Asia and Africa 
into southeastern Europe. They are absent from Madagascar and New Zealand. —

Osteological characters of this family are as follows : 

Teeth pleurodoiit, the roots anchylosed to the internal side of the 
premaxillary and maxillary bones. Premaxillary not cut off from max- 
illa-palatines by maxillaries. 

Splenial well developed; Meckelian groove mostly closed; angular 
little developed on inner, much on outer side of ramus; coronoid pro- 
duced anteriorly, not posteriorly, on outer face of ramus. 

Vertebra? proccBlous. 

The varieties of visceral structure in this family are not very great. 
In the especially herbivorous genera the colon is much enlarged in 
diameter, and in Iguana it is divided by numerous partial septa. The 
liver generally has but a single posterior emargination, but in Anolis, 
Microlepis, Crotaphytus, and Phrynosoma there are two incisions, thus 
producing a short median lobe. The border is variously excavated to 
accommodate the folds of the small intestine and colon. Thus in IIol- 
brooMa, Crotaphytus, Lwmanctus^ Sceloporus, TJta, and some Phrynoso- 
mata, the border is deeply concave to the right of the middle line. In 
Liocephalus, Liolamns, Callisaurus, and some Scelopori, and Phrynoso- 
mata it is deeply excavated medially. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 221 

The hepatic mesenteries conform to the general type, with certain 
exceptions to be mentioned. Thus there are no right or left lateral 
hepatic mesenteries, and but one ventral. The right hepatic supports 
the right lung. There is frequently a rudimental right lateral hepatic, 
which connects the long right apex of the liver with the right body 
wall. There is a gastrohepatic which generally spreads caudad over 
the space inclosed in the bend of the stomach. There is no left gastro- 
parietal sheet or baud. The most remarkable deviation from this type 
(which I have verified in twenty genera), is found in the Anolina. 
Here the left lung, besides its superolateral connection with the stomach, 
is connected by a special sheet with the left part of the inferior face of 
the liver, forming the left gastroheiiatic. Thus the latter organ is 
suspended by two sheets to the left side of the middle line. In genera 
where this is the case the two sheets are sometimes difficult to distin- 
guish, owing to their easy adhesion together. They may be separated 
by inserting a probe from the free caudad extremity of the lung. 

Another variation from the normal type is seen in the presence of a 
right lateral hepatic sheet in Phrynosoma and Polyehrns (in P. guttxrosus 
it is wanting in the one specimen examined). A left lateral sheet is 
present on the proximal half of the liver in Cyclura cornuta and Foly- 
chrus marmoratus. It is rudimental in Polyclirus acutirostris, and want- 
ing in P. giitturosus. There is a gastroparietal band in ('. cornuta.^ which 
is joined by the apex of the peritoneum of the corpus adiposum. 

I have examined the hemiiienis in thirty species of this family of the 
following genera : Anolis, Xqjhocercus, Polychrus, BaslUsciis, Ctenosanra, 
Cyclura, Iguana^ Corythophanes^ Sauromalus, Grotapliytus, Dipsosaurus, 
Liocephalus, Sceloporus, Callisaurus, HolhrooMa, Unyalioidcs, PorypJio- 
riis, Microlophns, Uraniscodon, and Phrynosoma. These differ in the 
bifurcation of the organ, varying from undivided {Cyclura, Iguana) to 
deeply bifurcate (A?to?is', Doryphorus, j\Iicrolop]iu,s, Uraniscodon). Other 
differences are seen in the number of the welts and their surface struc- 
ture, and the distribution and size of the calyces. Thus tlie calyces 
extend to the base in Anolis, but are confined to the apex in Crotaphy- 
tus. They exist in series only in Cyclura, Iguana, Ctenosaura, Coryth- 
oplianes, and Sauromalus. They cover most of the organ in Scelopo- 
rus and Phrynosoma. The systematic arrangement of the genera in 
accordance with the characters is as follows : 

I. Calyces always present. 

A. Three welts, oue opposite the sulcus spermaticus, aud one parallel on each 

side of it, transversely laminate. 
Ctenosaura, Cyclura, Iguana, Coryihophanes, Sauromalus, Crotaphytua. 

B. Three welts, one opposite sulcus, the others one on each side of sulcus, con- 

verging to median welt and inclosing spaces with it. Surfaces 
calyculate. 
a. Welt confluent proximad. 

Dipsosaurus, lAoceplialuN, Phrynosoma. 
aa. Welt projecting free proximad. 
Callisaurus, Uolbrookia.

D. A median, no lateral welts ; calyculate.

acx. Shortly bifurcate; calyces extending proximad of branclies.

II. No calyces or welts. 

a. Bifurcate ; surface coarsely wrinkled. 

Folyclirus. 

In the genera Gtenosaura, Cyclura, Igucma, Sauromalus, and Enyali- 
oides {laticeps) the organ is entire ; in the others it is bilobate or bifurcate. 
Boulenger makes the following observations on this family : 

The lizards of this family resemble very closely, in external as well as internal 
characters, those of the preceding, or Agamida', from which they are distinguished 
by the pleurodont dentition. The distinct heterodontism, so frequent in the latter 
family, is exhibited to a slight degree by one genus only ( Uraniscodon) ; in all others 
the teeth are subequal in size, and if, as is usually the case, the lateral ones differ 
from the front ones, the change is gradual. In all genera, save Amblyrhynchus, Cono- 
lophus, and riiymaiurus, the anterior teeth are conical; the lateral ones are also some- 
times simply conical or with obtuse crowns, but more frequently compressed and 
tricuspid; in Iguana and Cyclura cornuta the crowns are finely denticulated on the 
edge. In the above-named highly remarkable Amhlyrhynchus, Conolophus, and Fhy- 
maturus all the teeth are deeply trilobate or flower-de-luce shaped. The shafts of the 
teeth are constantly long and cylindrical and hollowed out at the base. Pterygoid 
teeth are present in many species; I have not employed this character for the dis- 
tinction of genera unless accompanied by others. Chamwleolis is one of the few 
lizards in which teeth are inserted on the j)alatiuo bone. 

The skull docs not differ in any important point from that of the Agamida-. How- 
ever, dermal cranial ossifications, as, for instance, the horn-like tubercles of Fhry- 
nosoma, may be present. A supraorbital arch, such as has been noticed in the 
Agamoid genus Lyriocephalus, Corythophanes, and I'hrynosoma. The clavicle is slen- 
der proximally, except in the genera liasilisciis and Lamanctus. The interclavicle 
is T- or anchor-shaped, except in I'hrynosoma, in which the longitudinal limit is 
absent. The sternum is frequently perforated by a fontanelle. A more or less com- 
plete system of ossified or tendinous abdominal ribs is developed in many genera, in 
some {Anolis, Polychrus, Liosaurns, etc.) to the same extent as in the Geckonidas. 

The tongue is thick and villose, entirely fixed to the floor of the mouth, or slightly 
free anteriorlj-, and not, or but feebly, nicked. The pupil of the eye is round and 
the eyelids well developed. The tympanum is distinct, except in Jlolbrookia. 

Femoral pores exist in all North American genera, and are alisent in the great 
majority of the South American. In some of the latter the males have a series of 
pores on the anterior border of the vent. When femoral pores are present in North 
American genera they are pierced in an undivided scale. 

The scaling of the head and body varies extremely, and gular appendages, crests, 
and other ornaments are not infrequent. The upper head scales are usually small, 
but in some genera assume a shield-like disposition. An enlarged scale is usually 
present, representing the interparietal of other lizards, and through fusion with 
adjacent scales sometimes acquires a remarkably large size. Following the example 
of previous authors, and for convenience, I have used the term "occipital" for this 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 223 

sliieUl, nltliough it is not homologous with that so called; but I have liad to depart 
from this rule iu dealing with tlio genus Liolwmus, in which, owing to the greater 
development of the parietals and the piesence of a true occipital, that terminology 
might have led to confusion. 

The habits of the numerous members of this family are as varied as their physiog- 
nomy. All the forms which we have observed in the Agamoids are repeated here 
save the parachute-bearing Dragons, which have no pleurodont analogues. On the 
other hand, sucli types as the Anoles, with their digital expansions, and the semi- 
marine algivorous Amhhjrhynchns are unrepresented in the acrodont series. How- 
ever, this apparent parallelism between the Agamoid and Iguanoid series of genera 
is very superficial, and there is, it appears to uie, not one form so exactly repeated 
iu both as to deserve to be united into the same genus were the character of the 
dentition, on which the family distinction i? based, not to be considered. 

The great majority of Iguanoids are iusectivorons; Ljuana, BrachijJopus, Amhly- 
rlnjnchus, ConoJojihus, ritymatHrus, Sauromahis, Basillscus, and Dijysosaurus are herbi- 
vorous, and the Ctenosaura are reported to be omnivorous. 

Mr. J. Percy Moore' states that the Liocephalus carinatus of tLe 
Bahama Islands is carnivorous, '^ not even stopi)iiig at cannibalism,'' 
while from the stomach of an individual of the same species, also from 
the Bahamas, I took parts of flowers, with seed vessels and seeds; so 
that this form also is omnivorous. 

Some species of Sceloporiis and Fhriinosoma are at i)reseut the only Iguanoids 
known to be ovoviparous. 

With the exception of two genera occurring in Madagascar and one in the Friendly 
and Fiji islands, the range of this family is restricted to the New World. — (Boulenger. ) 

Systeniatie. — The elements composing the 7uandible may be fused at 
some points in certain genera, as may be discovered under the heads of 
the osteology of each. In Anolina' the surangular is either wanting or 
is fused with the angular. On this ground I proposed at one time to 
separate this group from the remainder of the Iguanidjii as a distinct 
family, but the presence of similar variations in some genera of the 
latter makes it proper to abandon this course. 

There are three distinct subfamilies of this family, which may be dis- 
tinguished by characters of the skeleton. The first is characterized by 
the presence of numerous abdominal ribs, which do not connect with 
the sternum. This is the Anolina' of the present work, and the Gastro- 
pleura' of Wiegmanu (1834). I have fortified this character by the 
discovery of the peculiarity of the left pulmonary mesentery, above 
mentioned. In the two other subfamilies the mesenteric characters are 
identical. In the Basiliscina^ the proximal extremity of the clavicle is 
expanded and perforated, as iu the Teiidj^ and other Leptogloss types. 
In the Iguanime it is simple. These divisions may be tabulated as 
follows : 

Abdominal ribs; clavicle simple; a left hepatopulmonary mesentery Angling 

No abdominal ribs; clavicle proximally looped; no left hepatopulmonary mesen- 
tery Hasiliscix.e 

No, or very few, abdominal ribs; clavicle i>roximally simple; no left hepatopulmon- 
ary mesentery Iguanin.e

while four are found in the Central [Sceloporous, Phrynosoma, Hol- 
hrooTcia, Crotaphytus). The Pacific district includes four {Sceloporus, 
Uta, Phrynosoma, Crotaphytus) ', while the remaining genera belong to 
the Sonoran. Of these genera Phrynosoma and Sceloporus only occur 
in the Mexican district of the neotropical realm.

228 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

The nearctic representatives of 'the IguauidsB agree in possessing the 
following characters : 

Tongue thick, fleshy, mnch depressed, attached firmly to the integ- 
ument of the lower jaw, slightly free along the sides and at the tip 
only (not behind), which is sometimes free for one-fifth, sometimes 
scarcely at all; end of tongue generally slightly notched (not at all in 
AnoUs), never bifurcated, and with two oval or triangular smooth disks 
beneath the tip, varying in size with the extent of freedom, the termi- 
nal notch being between these anteriorly and deeper as these are larger; 
tongue behind with a deep, wide notch, embracing the free end of the 
larynx, which is separated from the tongue proper by a depressed 
space (entrance in the notch) ; surface of the tongue uniformly and 
firmly papillose to the end; frenum of tongue single, median, and 
fleshy. Teeth always more or less compressed and three to five cusped 
posteriorly. Scales on the body rather small, generally subrhomboidal 
and arranged in slightly oblique series, more or less imbricated, most 
distinctly so anteriorly. 

Eyelids present in all. Males distinguished from females by the 
plates behind anus larger than the rest. Scales on the back arranged 
on each side of a central dorsal series. 

The superciliary scales are imbricate in front and sometimes behind, 
except in Sauromalus and Anolis, where they are serial or segmental. 

The genera which enter the nearctic fauna may be compared as fol- 
lows. They agree in the characters enumerated in the first paragraph. 

Thighs with femoral x>ores; no preanal ones. Orifice of posterior 
nares much anterior to middle of palate. Digits more or less cylindri- 
cal; never partially expanded. Under surface of the digits generally 
in one series of transverse lamellai, but these always have four or more 
ridges, forming conspicuous longitudinal series and imparting to each 
plate a strongly anterior serrated edge. Throat without longitudinal 
fold. A median mental plate.

Antepenultimate joint of the toes flattened, expanded, and with 
imbricated transverse lamellae. Throat with a long- vertical compressed 
fold, capable of expansion into a fan; femoral pores wanting. Eoof of 
mouth deeply and broadly excavated, with a narrow furrow on its pos- 
terior half, widening behind and abruptly in front opposite the internal 
nares. Tongue thick, fleshy, triangular, rounded in front, emargiuate 
behind ; nostril above the canthus rostralis. 

The genus Anolis, as defined by Dumeril and Bibron, embraces a 
great number of species, differing widely in external characters, which 
have been made the basis of generic and subgeneric characters by vari- 
ous authors, especially by Fitzinger. In general, the species may be 
distinguished into five groups. There are, first, those that possess a 
caudal fin in the male sex; a few large species and one or two small 
ones from the West Indies. Second, species Avith compressed tail, with 
caudal crest of scales, and with smooth ventral scales; a moderate 
number of species, chiefly from the West Indies, but several from Mexico 
and Central America. Third, species with tail like the preceding, but 
with keeled ventral scales; a few species characteristically West Indian. 
Fourth, species without median superior crest of scales on the tail, 
which is more or less round ; ventral scales smooth ; numerous species 
from South America, Central America, Mexico, and a very few from the 
West Indies. Fifth, tail like the last, ventral scales keeled; the major-

ity of the species, chiefly from Central America and Mexico, but a few 
West Indian. 

The species inhabiting the United States belongs to the second sec- 
tion of the genus. In size it is intermediate. 

The species of this genus are of arboreal habits, and they abound in 
the tropical parts of America, and there only. They run with great 
rapidity on the trunks and branches of trees, and dodge the pursuer 
with great ease. Their food consists of insects, and to a large extent 
of ants. 

* The ^1. vermiculatus of Cuba is said by Poey to dive into the water 
after insects from bushes on the shore. The species of CJiamtvleolis 
have a good deal the ai)pearance of chameleons, but the posterior cranial 
arches are not so elevated. All the species have wonderful powers of 
metachrosis, in which respect they quite equal the chameleons. Within 
the genus Anolis, which embraces 120 species, there is a great range of 
size and form. Thus the species A. cuvieri and ricordii of the Antilles 
and edwardsii of Jamaica reach a foot and more in length, while the A. 
distichus does not exceed 3 inches. The species cuvieri and ricor-dii, 
with the smaller cristatellus of the Virgin Islands, are i)eculiar in the 
possession of a caudal fin in the males, which is stretched on a frame 
composed of the neural spines of the vertebne, as in the genus Basi- 
lisciis. This structure disappears so insensibly in the allied species 
that we can not sustain the genus Dactyloa Gray, proposed for such 
forms. In coloration the species display much beauty and variety. 
Thus, the A. edwardaii and cuvieri become a most vivid green under 
appropriate circumstances. The A. heliactin of Mexico is a golden 
yellow, and A. indcliellus of the Virgin Islands is also a metallic yellow. 
The A. cyanopleurus of Cuba is a brilliant blue, as is also the Haytiau 
A. ccdestinus. A. loysianus is of a kaolin white at times. The large A. 
insignis of Costa Eica displays delicate dove and fawn colors, mingled 
with more brilliant tints. The fans of the males are generally marked 
with pink, purple, blue, or golden spots. 

Osteology. — The following osteological description is taken principally 
from the A. caroliuensis, but other species which I have examined do 
not differ from it. 

Premaxillary with long superior spine, and no inferior spine, but a 
notch. Nasals distinct, separated by premaxillary spine. Frontal and 
parietal bones each undivided, the pineal foramen on the coronal suture. 
Prefrontal large, not extending over orbit; lachrymal narrow, in con- 
tact Avithjugal. Postfroutal small, distinct; i^ostorbital large. Supra- 
temporal slender, forming the greater part of the supratemporal arch, 
its anterior extremity in contact with the postorbital and ])ostorbital 
process of jugal bones. Paroccipital small; parietoquadrate arch well 
developed. Supraoccipital loosely attached, coossitied Avith exoccipital. 

The frontal bone is grooved on the median line below. The post- 
optics are within the epipterygoids, and are curved, inclosing a subcir- 



232 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

cular space, and have a short external branch. The epipterygoid 
leaves the pterygoid behind the ectopterygoid process, and articulates 
with the parietal, passing some distance in front of the petrosal. The 
petrosal is very short above; the subforaminal process is distinct, and 
the inferior groove looks outward as well as downward. Quadrate with 
wide external conch and no internal conch. Stapes not deeply sunk; 
columella slender. The vomers are flat and elongate, and are not sep- 
arated by a groove. The palatines are broad and flat, and the maxillo- 
palatlne foramen is small. The pterygoids are broad and flat in front, 
and are then abruptly contracted from the outside to a narrow poste- 
rior part. This curves outward from the long basipterygoid processes 
to the quadrate. The ectopterygoids are short and are deflected at the 
X)roximal extremity. Presphenoid long and rodlike. Occipital condyle 
convex, simple, without exoccipital divisions. 

The mandible has marked peculiarities. The Meckelian groove is 
closed, and the splenial bone, if present, is minute. I do not detect it 
in the A. varolinensis. There is a fossa on the inside of the ramus at 
the base of the coronoid. The latter bone is developed much anterior 
to its apex on the external face, and not posteriorly. The dentary is 
produced far i^osterior to the coronoid. The angular and articular are 
fused, and the angle is rather short and has an internal angular pro- 
jection [XipJiocercus valenciennii, Anolis equestris, A. marmoratiis, A. 
caroJinensis). 

The hyoid apparatus has the extreme development seen in all the 
lizards with a gular compressed pouch or fan. That is, the cerato- 
branchials of the second pair are closely appressed and produced to a 
great length. First pair of ceratobranchials and ceratohyals simple, 
the latter attached to the extremities of the moderately developed 
hypohyals. 

The scaijular arch conforms to the Iguanid type. There is a pro- 
scapula well above the coracoid, and a single coracoid notch. The 
sternum has a small median fontanelle which is reached by the long 
posterior limb of the interclavicle. Two ribs attached to each side of 
sternum, and three to each of the slender, closely appressed xiphoid 
rods. There are five x^airs of abdominal ribs in Anolis carolinensis^ and 
four, five, and six in other species. 

The vertebra- have no zyosphen nor elongate diapophyses. There are 
eight cervical vertebrae, of which only the last four have ribs, all of 
which have simple heads, the last two being elongate and reaching to 
the plane of the sternum. 

The caudal vertebrtie have no supplementary dividing suture, and 
there is but one neural spine. The chevron bones are attached at the 
extremity of the centrum. 

The pubes unite at an acute angle, and have well -developed pectineal 
process at the middle of their length. The ischia have a prominent tuber. 

The premaxillary and anterior maxillary teeth are simple; the others 
are tricuspid.

internally, and riuiniug forward distinctly between the nostrils, Nos- 
trils more superior tbaii lateral; inside of the canthus rostralis, which 
extends nearly to end of snout. Cephalic plates all longitudinally 
rugose or carinated. Xo crest on back or tail. Tail rounded. Scales 
on body and sides small, paved, slightly angular, and about equal; 
those of belly larger, oval, carinated. Large scales of the leg confined 
chietiy to the anterior surfaces. 

Color green or brown above, whitish beneath. Cheeks with a long 
dusky spot. Upi^er parts sometimes blotched with dusky, as also occa- 
sionally the inside of legs. Chin with three dotted lines on each side 
interrupted anteriorly. 

Head very large, forming nearly or quite one-third of the distance 
from suout to anus; much depressed and pyramidal; the sides plane, 
straight, and convergiug to near the rounded tip, and perpendicular to 
the j)lane upper surface. The width is about one-half the length to 
tlie ear. JTostrils entirely superior and internal to the canthus rostralis, 
opposite the junction of the first and st^cond labial. Upper surface of 
head with ten ridges more conspicuous with age, which begin as a 
posterior and inner border to the supraorbital region, wider a little in 
front of this, and then converge until they meet between the nostrils. 
All the plates on the head large and longitudinally wrinkled. The 
cephalic ridges are composed each of about twelve plates, which, with a 
few intermediate ones, are the largest on the head. The supraorbital 
space exhibits five or six large plates in two series (the inner largest) 
and bordered internally by one row, externally by thirteen or fourteen of 
small tubercular jilates. The canthus rostralis is formed by six sharp, 
long, imbricated plates; the side of the head below this to the labials is 
longitudinally excavated, the space occupied behind by five rows of 
nearly equal plates. The rostral is very broad, but low. There are 10 
long, low, upper labials and about 11 lower; there is no median plate at 
the end of the lower jaw. The lower labials are margined by several 
series of elongated narrow plates, three or four anteriorly and a larger 
number behind, the third larger than the rest. All the other plates 
on the under surface of the head are small, elongated, tubercular, and 
paved. The scales are all small and nearly uniform on the back and 
sides, where they are tubercular, rounded, slightly carinated, but not 
imbricated. The belly scales are larger, more imbricated and rhom- 
boidal, more carinated. The scales on the legs resemble those of the 
sides, except on the anterior faces when the limbs are folded and drawn 
up, where the scales are larger, imbricated, carinated, and acute. The 
scales on the tail are larger, strongly carinate, and in whorls. It is 
about twice the head and body, compressed and much attenuated, 
with a central series of larger scales along the upper edge. The hind 
leg brought forward reaches to the lower jaw; the hind foot is two- 
thirds the head, and is contained about four times in the head and 
body. It is about equal to the fore leg from the elbow. The fifth hind

toe is uot quite as long as the second: the Iree portion of the longest 
is less than half the head. There are no crests along the dorsal line. 
There is a conspicuous longitudinal fold or tlap of skin beginning 
about the middle of the chin and extending back sometimes over the 
entire chest. 

I find a good deal of apparent variation in the proportions of the 
head, which sometimes seems to be shorter and broader than as 
described. I am, however, unable, with the series in hand, to find 
any other characters to correspond. As far as I can judge, the form 
with broader head is most abundant among specimens from the Mis- 
sissippi Valley, those from the Atlantic States and Florida being as 
described above. 

In the alcoholic specimen the color varies from light green to gray or 
brownish olive; greenish white beneath, sometimes brassy or bronzed, 
and palest about the pubic region. The edge of the upper jaw is 
whitish, the space behind the eye (sometimes before it) blackish. Be- 
neath the head are several faint longitudinal lines (two or three on 
each side) of elongated spots, usually obsolete on the tip of the chin. 

Sometimes there is an indistinct olivaceous yellow tinge along the 
back 5 the upper surfaces spotted with black, especially along this yel- 
lowish region. 

Dumeril and Bibron find no difference between the common Anolis 
of the Southern United States and one inhabiting Cuba, beyond the 
brighter colors and the absence of the dusky patch on the temples. 
On comparing pretty large series, however, I find that the cephalic 
plates of the Cuban animal are smoother and more regular, especially 
those on the side; the head more truncate anteriorly; the nostril 
apparently farther back; the scales on the fore part of back and, to a 
less extent, the body generally decidedly larger. The dilation of the 
toes is also more conspicuous. The cheeks, as stated, are without the 
brown patch. 

The Anolis caroUnensis is distributed from the Bio Grande to Flor- 
ida, inclusive, and extends as far north as Kinston, ISTorth Carolina. 
It is, moreover, common in the Bahama Islands and Cuba, where it 
reaches a size rather superior to what is usual in the United States. 

The following notes as to the food, habits, and color changes of Anolis 
jryixcipalis were made by Rev. S. Lockwood, who had a specimen under 
observation for a number of months.' 

It was observed that Anolis did not fancy beetles, but was fond of 
diptera or Hies, while an occjasional spider was taken with a relish. In 
capturing its prey, which was i)ut alive into the fern case where the 
lizard was confined, the whole process was direct and neatly done, and 
the food secured without a bit of leaf or straw. Its cast-off skin, shed 
several times in one summer, was also invariably eaten, and even the 
bits that fell between the plants were carefully picked up. 



'Americau Ntituialist, X, 1876, p. 4.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



Its two extremes of color are a deep, warm, bronzy brown aud a pale 
but bright pea green. Throughout the day, although occasionally 
playing with diverse colors, it was for the most i^art brown, and this, 
too, although walking or nestling ainong green leaves. At night, when 
suspended, head up, from the posts at the corners of the fern case, it 
was invariably found to be a bright green. 

Its change of color while basking in the sun is given in the foUow- 
ing language: 

Now begins that wondorfnl play of colors. It appears first in tLe normal bronze 
brown of tlie back. Literally they are lively colors, snch are the moving changes, 
as the folds of the skin, especially those on the neck, catch the sunlight. That deep 
umber is now mellowing into a yellowish brown. A minute more and it has a bronze, 
coppery tint. Now it runs into an olive green; anon, a leek green; at hist, a pale 
but bright pea green. Through all this color transformation there is on the back 
a medial line extending from head to tail which is always of a hue paler than all 
the rest. As to the under parts, the customary ashiness is all gone. It is white, 
not glaring, but soft. I think the tiny scales are set a little on edge, thus giving 
the white the aspect of frosted silver. Over the green of the back is a bloom, so 
that it looks like frosted green. 'J he toj) of the fiat head doggedly retains its dark, 
normal brown. * "^ * In ordinary repose the eyelids are pale brown, but these 
organs are equally susceptible of color change. Not only will they run rapidly 
through the whole scale, but the positive ccdors will be spread in decided and rapid 
contrast. These winking lids emulate the gems. Now a palish brown, they are 
smoky topazes. Instantly they become green emeralds, and, quicker than one can 
write, flash into the peculiar blue of the turquoise. 

The delicate markings of very dark brown on the back and sides, 
made up of straight lines, zigzags, and chevrons, are constant, never 
changing their color. 

Only twice during the summer did Mr. Lockwood's specimen exhibit 
the phenomena of inflating its throat. Then the colors of the dewlap 
were very fine, ending in a perfect flame of intense scarlet. 

When the first sharp days of October set in, the lizard selected a 
hummock of dry sphagnum in the fern case, and with its nose worked 
a hole something after the manner of a toad while making its hole. 
This burrow was utilized for a sleeping place, and was occupied also on 
cold, dark days.

The genus Ctenosaura includes species of large size, which inhabit 
the forests of the Central American region. In other parts of Neotro- 
pica they are unknown. In the West Indian region their place is taken 
by the genus Gyclura, while Iguana ranges almost tlie entire realm. 
One species enters the extreme limit of Nearctica, at the southern part 
of the Lower Californian Peninsula, and one occupies the Plateau to 
southern Arizona. 

The species are powerful and active, and can make a good defense 
when necessary by the use of their small sharp teeth and of their 
spinous tail. This organ is armed with rings of spinous scales, which 
are very acute, and which inflict considerable wounds when driven 
against the naked surface of the skin. In the smallest species, the 
C. quinquecarinata, the spines are especially large and are fewer in 
number than the other species, the form approaching the allied genus, 
Cacliryx Cope. In the latter, of which the species are also Central 
American, the tail is abbreviated so as to be si)inous to the end. In 
Ctenosaura the spines terminate a considerable distance cephalad of 
the distal part of the long slender tail. 

These reptiles are valued as food by the natives of Central America, 
where they, like other large tree lizards, are called Iguanas.

This species was known to De Blainville as long ago as 1835, and he 
gives a figure of it. He and Bocourt, in his fine work on the reptiles 
of Mexico, regarded it as the Lacerta acanthura of Shaw.^ This can 
not be correct, as Shaw distinctly states that the dorsal crest of his 
species extends to the rump. It is probably one of the species of the 
next section (II) of the genus, but whicli one I am unable to ascertain. 

CTENOSAURA MULTISPINIS Cope. . 

Ctenosaura multispinis Cope, Proc, American Philosophical Society, XXIII, 1885, 
p. 267. 

Head elongate, flat above, muzzle narrowed; nostril in the second 
third of the length to the orbit. Three scales on canthus rostralis, each 
deeper than long. Seven flat scales across muzzle between anterior 
angles of orbits. Two rows between supraorbital series. Scales above 
temporal muscles ratlier large, weakly keeled. Five series of infralabial 
plates, not separated by smaller ones. Dorsal crest rather elevated 
in adult, terminating at the rump. Median caudal crest composed of 
conical scales, beginning above the posterior margin of the femora. 
Tail cylindrical at base, covered by whorls of prominent scales with 
conical points which project strongly and which are separated by one 
row of smaller flat scales on the upper half of the tail. On the inferior 
side of the tail the whorl rows are separated by two intervening rows, 
which are just like them, having a keel and a mucronate apex. Beyond 
the middle of the length (end lost) the tail is strongly compressed, but 
whether this due to shriveling on drying 1 am not sure. Median series 
of spinous scales uninterrupted. The abdominal scales are larger than 
the dorsal, which are longer than the lateral scales; all are subquad- 
rate, and none are keeled. 

Seven femoral i^ores. Color, above and below, black. 

Measurements. — Length from end of muzzle to vent, -J55 mm. ; length to 
line of axilla, 125 mm. ; length to line of auricular meatus, 62 mm. ; width

meatus, 35 mm. ; leiiytb of auterior limb, 93 mm. ; length of anterior foot, 
37 mm. ; length of posterior limb, 150 mm. ; length of posterior foot, 76 mm. 

I have before me two stuffed specimens of this species, a large one 
and probably adult, and a smaller and younger one, which I described 
above. This is No 201 of Sumichrast's collection, and was procured by 
him at Dondoniingvillo, in the State of Oaxaca, and sent to the Smith 
souian Institution. The other specimen was obtained near Batopilas, 
Chihuahua, by Mr. Edward Wilkinson, and was recorded by me as 
Gyclura acanthura in the catalogue of his collection.' It agrees with 
the t3'pe specimen in having the distal two-thirds of the tail strongly 
compressed. The dorsal crest is much less elevated, probably owing 
to its younger age. The colors are paler, the prevailing tint being light 
brown with indistinct darker brown cross bands. More recently a 
specimen was sent to the U.S. National Museum from Xogales, a town 
which stands on the line between Arizona and Chihuahua. The species 
is clearly to be included in the area of the Columbian Realm. 

I find a specimen of this species, enumerated as Yar. B of Cte>iosaHra 
acanthura by liouleuger.'^

esting peculiarities wliicli constitute difference from Crotaphytiis, to 
which its general appearance suggests affinity. 

Premaxillary bone with elongate superior spine and posterior emar- 
gination of inferior face. Nasals large, distinct, not shortened in front, 
since the nostrils open forward. Frontal narrow, entire, grooved on 
the middle line below, its posterior region pierced by the pineal foramen, 
which is entirely anterior to the coronal suture (D. dorsalis). Suj)ra- 
occipital loosely articulated anteriorly, and not distinct from exoccip- 
itals. Prefrontals large, not extending over orbit; lachrymal smaller, 
touched by jugal. Postfrontal small, distinct from the large postorbital. 
The latter articulates extensively with both the jugal and supratem- 
poral. Paroccipital small. Parietoquadrate arch well elevated. The 
vomers together as broad as long, not produced posteriorly, with a 
median fossa. Palatine flat, with a short maxillary process; pterygoid 
flat in front, concave on the inner side behind for contact with the long 
basipterygoid process. Ectopterygoid decurved at its inner extremity. 
Quadrate with a narrow internal and a wide external conch. Postoptic 
ah open sigmoid, reaching frontal above, with a median expansion with 
rudiment of posterior limb. Petrosal very short above; subforaminal 
portion prominent, with gi wide inferior groove looking downward. 
Epipterygoid leaving pterygoid behind ectopterygoid process, and 
reaching parietal without contact with petrosal. Presphenoid rudi- 
mental; sphenoid and basioccipital united, and with prominent lateral 
edges. Occipital condyle with exoccipital elements feebly distinguislied. 

In the mandible the Meckelian groove is completely curved. The 
coronoid has little horizontal extent, and that is principally anteriorly 
on the external side. The surangular and articular are fused together, 
and the splenial is small. The dentary extends as far posteriorly as 
the posterior border of the coronoid. The angle is prominent, flattened 
so as to be horizontal, and has an internal angle. 

The scapula has a large j^roscapula directed upward, and the coracoid 
has one emargination, which is large. The sternum has a narrow 
median fontanelle which is not covered by the interclavicle. There are 
four pairs of ribs articulated to the sternum, and two continue into the 
approximated xiphoid rods. The ribs reach the sacrum. 

Vertebra? with a zygosphen articulation. Eight cervical vertebnii, 
the anterior with a compressed hypapophysis, which soon becomes a 
keel, which is absent on the eighth cervical and all following vertebne. 
Four anterior vertebra? without ribs; seventh and eighth with long 
ribs. Diai)ophyses very short, excejit in the caudal region, where they 
are present for half its length, increasing in length to the base, where 
they are quite elongate. Chevron bones intercentral. Neural spines 
of dorsal region low; of caudal region rather elevated, oblique, and 
preceded by a compressed vertical iirominence or anterior neural spine. 
The centra are transversely segmented just in front of the diapophysis, 
except in the anterior part ol the series. 

The angle of junction of the pubes is nearly right, and the i)ectineal

process is median, short, and deourved. The iscliia have a long, com- 
mon suture, and are deflected downward, meeting at less than a right 
angle. Tuber a prominent angle. The ilium presents a short subacute 
angle, representing the crista. There is a deep posterior notch of the 
acetabulum. 

In Dipsosaurus dorsaUs all the teeth on the maxillary bone are tri- 
cuspidate; those on the premaxillary are mostly simple, but one or two 
external ones show a rudimental lateral cusp. 

In the only known species the colon is well developed, and the small 
intestine is elongate. Its habits are herbivorous, as I have taken 
remains of flowers from their stomachs.

Head small, scarcely as wide as the neck, or more than half the 
length of hind foot; rather longer than broad; muzzle blunt: forehead 
sloping very rapidly. A single gular fold. The scales on the chin 
large, granular, and nearly even. A conspicuous ridge on the back 
from head to middle of tail, formed of a single series of scales larger

than elsewhere, each scale conspicuously keeled. The other scales 
above about equal, slightly reticulated and diamond-shaped, each one 
with a slight keel. Scales on the belly similar, but larger; those on the 
sides smaller than either. Scales on the tail keeled, on the belly 
smooth. Tail compressed; about twice as long as the body. Auditory 
aperture vertically elongated, with the anterior edge dentated. Infra- 
orbital chin composed chiefly of one single horizontal plate. Femoral 
pores distinct in the adult male. 

Head very short, not one- fifth the length from snont to anus. Hind 
foot not quite two-fifths this length. Tail twice as long. It is readily 
fractured, differing in this respect from the species of Grotaphytus, where 
it is" quite tough. 

General color in alcohol brownish yellow, the sides and legs marked 
with lines of brownish red, which anastomose to a greater or less extent 
and inclose rounded or polygonal yellowish blotches, which are less 
distinct on the back; the under part generally yellowish; the tail with 
an alternation of nearly equal yellowish and brownish rings interrupted 
below. 

In young specimens there are two blackish spots above each shoulder. 
The side of the head is barred vertically with bluish, the chin and 
throat faintly blotched with the same. The orbits are dusky, with a 
yellow bar at each end of the eye. 

This species ranges from Cape St. Lucas along the gulf coast of 
Lower California to the Colorado and Mohave deserts. To the east it 
extends at least as far as the Colorado River, but how far beyond is 
not known. Its northern range is indicated below. 

In regard to the habits of Dipsosaiirus dorsalis, Dr. Merriam remarks^ 
as follows : 

This remarkable lizard is more strictly limited to the torrid Lower Sonorau Zone 
thau any other species, not excepting the gridiron-tail {CalUsaiu-iis ventralis). It 
ranges across the Lower Sonoran deserts of the Great liasin from the Mohave Desert 
and Death Valley to the Great Bend of the Colorado River, and thence northerly in 
eastern Nevada through the lower part of the valleys of the Virgin and Muddy, 
always keeping within the Larrea belt. In western Nevada it reaches its northern 
limit in the Amargosa Desert, and was not found in Oasis Valley or Indian Spring 
Valley. In the northwest arm of Death Valley it does not range northward beyond 
Grapevine Canyon, and in Owens Valley was not found much north of the lake. It 
is a strict vegetarian, feeding on buds and flowers, which it devours in large quan- 
tities. No insects were found in any of the stomachs examined; some contained 
beautiful bouquets of the yellow blossoms of Acacia, the orange ^ralvastrum, the 
rich i^urple Dalea, and the mesquite {Prosoim juUjlora) ; others contained leaves only.

246 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Tongue arrow-shaped, slightly notched at tip; where it is free as at the 
sides, the tip beneath with two ovate disks. Palatine teeth. Cheek 
teeth compressed, with three-lobed crown behind; conical anteriorly; 
the bases apparently in a shallow groove ; the space between the bases 
of the teeth tilled up partly with bone. 

Osteology. — The skeletons of the two most abundant species are before 
me, namely, the C.coUaris Holbrook and G. unslizenii Bairdand-Girard, 
The following description includes both, and if any differences between 
the two exist, they are mentioned. 

The premaxillary has a long spine above and a concave border behind 
on the palate, from which projects forward a pair of juxtaposed proc- 
esses which together form a button-like process which has an anterior 
free border. The nasals are wide and shortened by the removal of 
their anterior border on account of the large size and partly vertical 
direction of the nostrils. Frontal single, narrow ; pineal foramen touch- 
ing coronal suture, in the frontal bone in (J. collaris and in the parietal 
in C. unslizenii. Prefrontal large, with a prominent preocular boss, not 
extending posteriorly over the orbit. Lachrymal small, in line with and 
touching the jugal. Postfrontal wanting; its place taken by a process 
of the frontal. Postorbital large, uniting exteriorly with jugal and 
supratemporal. Parietoquadrate arch elevated; supraoccipital bone 
loosely articulated, not distinct from exoccipital. Quadrate with rather 
flat conchs, the external the larger, and with straight external border. 
Postoptics not reaching frontal, curved, with short posterior branch. 
Petrosal with prominent subforaminal jiortion, which has an open groove 
looking downward. Vomers short and wide, not sej)arated by a groove. 
Palatines flat, with short maxillary process. Pterygoids rather nar- 
rowed by the large palatine foramina; posterior part grooved and 
receiving basipterygoid processes. Ectopterygoids depressed inter- 
nally. Epipterygoid originating behind ectopterygoid process, and 
reaching parietal without contact with petrosal. Presphenoid rudi- 
mental; sphenoid and basioccipital confluent. Occipital condyle j/lain, 
with exoccipital elements not distinct. The fenestra ovalis and foramen 
of eighth nerve sunk in deep fossie. 

In the mandible the terminal part of Meckel's cartilage is exposed. 
The coronoid has no extension on the external face, and extends a short 
distance forward on the inner face. The splenial is rather elongate, 
and extends anterior to the splenial foramen. The dentary extends to 
the line of the posterior border of the coronoid above and of its ante- 
rior border blow. In old individuals the surangular and articular are 
fused. The angle is pinched, and sends inward a horizontal process 
similar to its posterior process. 

In the hyoid apparatus the ceratobranchials of the second pair are 
closely appressed, thus supporting a median gular angle. The hypo- 
hyals are moderately long, and they join by their extremities the cera- 
tohyals, which have no expansions and are of only moderate length. 



CROrODILlANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 247 

The scapula has a well-dev^'loped proscapula, and thoie aio two deej) 
eiiiargiuatious of the coracoid. The steiiiuiu has a narrow lougitudiiial 
median fontanelle in the G. colkiris, and uo I'outauelle in C. wisUzenii 
(one specimen of each examined). There are four ribs articulating 
directly with the sternum on each side, and two by means of each 
xiphoid rod. The latter are not closely appressed as in some, nor so 
widely separated as in other Iguanidie. 

Vertebrae without zygosphenal articulation, but the prezygapophyseal 
faces concave. Cervical vertebr;c eight, the anterior five vertebra?, with 
six free intercentra in C. wisUzenii and four vertebric wdth live inter- 
centra in G. collaris; anterior three vertebric without ribs in both 
species. The neural spines are very low on the dorsal vertebrae, and 
are a little more elevated on the caudals. The latter have a pro- 
jecting keel toward the anterior jiart in the G. wisUzenii (wanting 
in G. eoUaris), which represents the anterior neural spine of IHpso 
sauru.H dorsaUs. The centra in GrotaphytuH are not segmented. Dia- 
pophyses are present, but are nowhere long. Short ribs extend to the 
sacrum. 

The teeth are tricuspid, but in the two species examined the lateral 
cusps are rudimental. Anterolateral and incisor teeth simple, subequal. 
The pubes luiite at an exceedingly open angle, and the ])ectiueal proc- 
ess is submedian. Tuber ischii prominent, a small angle, or crista ilii. 
Acetabulum entire posteriorly. 

The principal characters in which the skeleton of the Grotaphi/tus 
differs from Bipsosaurus are the following: Nasal bones shortened in 
front; no postfrontals ; pineal foramen connected with coronal suture; 
Meckelian canal i)artlyopeu; two notches of coracoid; xiphoid rods 
not appressed ; no zygosphen; caudal centra not divided; acetabulum 
not deeply notched. 

There is a small median posterior lobe of the liver. The left lobe is 
larger than usual in this family, so as to cause a deep excavation of the 
posterior border. The colon is not so large as in Bipsofiaurus, and there 
is no c;ecum. The small intestine is rather long. 

The species of this genus are insectivorous. 1 have taken fragments 
of grasshoppers from the stomachs of both G. coUarin and G. ivisUzenii. 

Interorbital scales in one or two rows ; other scales above bead larger. Under 
surface of fore and hind feet with the scales large, carinattMl, and niuerouate. Infra- 
orbital chain in a series or six or eight sube(|uai scales. 

Scales on the gular fold equal to those below the fore legs. General color greenish 
or grayish: the back thickly spotted with whitish (in alcoholic specimens; red 
perhaps in life). A double black collar on each side the neck. Cliin bluish or 
green, reticulated with yellowish. Young with the large rounded or sub- 
polygonal' dark blotches in an ashy ground; the back and tail marked with 

transverse bars of whitish C. collaris. 

Scales on the gular fold much smaller than those between the fore legs. General 
color above grayish, with a hexagonal reticulation of lighter. The interstices 
here and there abruptly dark brown, a trace only of a black collar on the neck 
in a single specimen. Chin and throat reticulated. No light spots .C.reticulatus.

luterorbitiil scales iu three or four rows (rarely in two rows). Other scales on 
head above small. Infraorbital chain composed of a single large plate, with one or 
two small ones at each end. Ifnder surface of feet with small and generally almost 
smooth scales. 

Scales ougular fold as large as those between the fore legs. General color brownish 
yellow, with large, dark, rounded spots, the intervals usually sprinkled or dotted 
with red (whitish in spirits) ; the tail and generally the back with a succession 
of transverse light bands. The chain broadly streaked longtudiually with 
bluish, without any trace of reticulation. The light dots sometimes wanting, 
and, to a greater or less extent, the dark spots; the ground color then being

and front of head. Of these there are two rows (sometimes one row) 



CROCODILIAN.S, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES, 241) 

between tlie middle orbits, and about seven between their anterior 
extremities; about six between the nostrils. Infraorbital i)lates nearly 
equal in a chain of about eight. Scales on anterior border of ear sub- 
acutely tubercular, i)rominent. Sometimes two scales of the suborbital 
series are fused, as in the specimen figured. Scales of gular fold as 
large as those between the forelegs. Scales on belly subhexagoual and 
imbricated; on the back smaller, rounded, tubercular, and not larger 
along the median line. Femoral pores about twenty-two. Scales on the 
under surfjice of hands and feet larger, cons|)icuously carinated and 
mucronate; on the hinder part of the tail moderately so; elsewhere 
the scales smooth. Upper parts of a variable shade of dark green or 
bluish; the thighs, back, and sides marked pretty regularly and 
closely with rounded or oblong light s})ots, which on the lower part 
of back and tail above exhibit a tendency to traimverse light bands. 
The upper part and sides of head, the tibia, and tail marked with 
similar dark spots. Two half rings of black, extending across the 
back between the insertion of the fore legs, each bordered bj'- yellow- 
ish. Under parts yellowish-white, tinged in specimens with greenish, 
especially between the fore legs; the chin and throat green or blue (some- 
times nearly black), and <]uite regularly reticulated with yellowish. 

The double black half collars are very constant; sometimes the 
anterior is interrupted above and the branches extended forward; this 
also seen sometimes in the posterior one. Both begin on the shoulders, 
and are seldom, if ever, connected below. 

The colors of this species vary exceedingly. In life the light spots, 
especially in young specimens, are of various shades of red, orange, 
yellow, white. In the young the light dorsal spots exhibit a great tend 
ency to arrangement in transverse bands, more or less continuous. The 
embryonic coloration appears to be a reticulation on the back and sides 
of grayish or light ashy, the meshes rather large, and inclosing black- 
ish rounded, scarcely polygonal spaces, arranged transversely; the 
back, with a succession of whitish (or perhaps reddish) bars at inter- 
vals. Of these there are about ten from head to tail, while on the tail 
they are much closer and even more regular, forming some forty to fifty 
half rings. The black collars, and the blue and yellowish reticulations 
on the chin are very distinctly marked. The light caudal rings are 
scarcely ever visible in the adult (where, on the contrary, the darker 
interspaces become more prominent) and but rarely the light dorsal 
bands; the light reticulation of the back becomes broken up with 
the light spots already mentioned. 

Sometimes the ground color is much lighter than that described, the 
under parts being quite puie whitish in alcohol, the upper light ashy 
olive. 

In one specimen (Cat. No. 1^721), the throat, upper part of breast, and 
the flanks are indigo black, very strongly marked. The tail appears 
unusually compressed. 



250 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, J89S. 

Cat. No. 2732, froui Cliihuabua, has a series of large rounded dark 
spots ou each side behind tlie fore leg, and the supraorbital plates are 
flatter than usual. Cat. No. 2768, from the Colorado Eiver, also shows 
the spots to less extent, but there is not the same difference iu the 
orbital plates. The specimens are not in sufficiently good condition to 
furnish satisfactory indications on other points. 

I)r. Stejneger has pointed out ' that specimens of this species from 
the Sonorau region always possess two series of frontal scales, while 
those from the Central region and the Texan district present generally 
but one row. He states, also, that the specimens which enter the former 
category have smaller supraocular scales, a narrower head, and a longer 
muzzle. He regards these as belonging to another species, which he 
calls G. haileyi. He observes, further, that "there can be no doubt that 
both forms are subsi^ecies of the same species, but whether the form 
now named for the first time should receive a trinomial appellation or 
not is quite another thing, depending, according to the code of zoolog- 
ical nomenclature adopted by the American Ornithologists' Union, 
which I adhere to in all my writings, on whether the two forms are now 
known to intergrade or not." Stejneger then goes on to observe that, 
" In the collection before me there are a few specimens which present 
features which at first sight might seem to indicate intergradation," 
and he points out three specimens of an intermediate character so far 
as regards the character of the frontal scales. 

My examination of the series in the national collection has convinced 
me of two things — first, that the differences observed by J>r. Stejneger 
exist, and are mainly characteristic of distinct geographical areas, and, 
second, that the transitions are so numerous that a distinct specific 
appellation is not practicable, and that even a distinct subspecific 
name is of doubtful utility. In arranging the specimens I set apart 
three lots — first, those presenting two rows of frontal scales ((7. haileyi) ; 
second, those with one row, and, third, those bottles which contain 
specimens, mostly from the same localities, of both kinds. Of the first 
lot there are thirty-six specimens, in the second twenty-two, and in the 
third twenty-two. The proportion of specimens which do not show geo- 
graphical limitation of range, it will be observed, is equal to those of the 
typical C. collar is, which do so.' Let us now analyze the characters of 
these two lots. In lot second, six specimens exhibit two rows ; eleven 
have one scale only which crosses the frontal region; four have two 
scales which cross, and one has three scales. In lot thiid (C collaris 
typical), four have one scale across the entire frontal bone; seventeen 
have two scales, and one has three scales so extending. It seems, then, 
of specimens in which the series of two scales is interrupted, that in 
fifteen one scale crosses the frontal space; in twenty-one two scales 
cross, and two have three scales crossing. Thus we find that the char- 
acter of the frontal scales is variable, since there are fifteen specimens

CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES.

intermediate between the two forms to thirty-six typical of the one, 
and twenty-four of the other. The bottles in which s]>ecimens of dif- 
ferent character occur are Cat. Nos. 2715, 2725, 8468, 8465, 12762, and 
are from near the Canadian River; from Santa Fe, New Mexico; the Kio 
Grande, Texas, etc., mostly localities intermediate between the ranges 
of the two forms. In my own collection, in three specimens from Fort 
Worth, in Texas, all the interorbital scales are divided but one in 
one, and all are divided in three specimens. In three, from near San 
Antonio, two scales cross in one specimen, one crosses in one, and none 
in one. 

The superorbitals are rather large in typical forms of the G, collarls 
from the central region, as stated by Stejneger, but variability is seen in 
these specimens quite as often as occurs in the frontal scaled. The same 
form has the widest head, but this character is still less constant than 
the others, the Sonoran form presenting the greatest variations in this 
respect. 

I found this species common in the rocks and open woods of the 
plateau country from near San Antonio to Mason County, north of 
Llano Kiver, or as far as my observation extended. In the northern 
part of the State, according to Boll, it first begins to be abundant near 
Weatherford, longitude 97° 50', and extends westward. This gentle- 
man has never seen it in the cretaceous region of Fort Worth and Dallas. 
I found it abundant in rocky ground along the eastern front of the Llano 
Estacado as far north as Miami and northward to Fort Supply, Okla- 
homa. In the east it extends north to southwest Missouri in the Ozark 
region ; also in northwest Nevada as far north as Pyramid Lake. Dr. 
J. L. Wortman obtained it for me on the Rruneau Eiver, in southern 
Idaho, its most northern station yet known. It runs very swiftly, carry- 
ing the tail over its back, like Holhrookia texana and various other 
iguanian lizards. In its manners it is j^erhaps the most pugnacious of 
our lizards, opening its mouth when cornered, and biting savagely. Its 
sharp teeth can do no more than slightly cut the skin.

Dr. C. H. Merriiim' gives the following iiccoimt of the habits of 
CrotaphytUH collar is : 

The "ring-necked" lizard does not inhabit the Larrea belt of the Lower Sonoran 
zone, but is sonimon in suitable places in the Upper Sonoran, whence it descends a 
short distance into the Grayia belt. It lives among rocks, frequently in canyons, and 
is commonest in the desert ranges. In the Panamint Mountains, California, it was 
found in Surprise Canyon, in Emigrant Canyon, just above the Larrea (altitude, 1,400 
meters, or 4, GOO feet). In the White Mountains it was secured in the canyon leading 
from Deep Spring Valley up over the pass (altitude, 1,700 meters, or 5,600 feet), and 
also high up on the west slope, always among rocks, and Mr. Nelson collected it in 
the Argus Mountains and in Coso Valley. In Nevada it was rather common on the 
west slope of the Charleston Mountains below Mountain Sj>ring, and was found also 
in Oa.sia Valley, at Quartz Spring, at the west part of the Desert Mountains (altitude, 
1,520 meters, or 5,000 feet) ; Utah (altitude, 1,830 to 2,040 meters, or 0,000 to 6,700 f«et), 
and in the upper part of Pahranagat Valley. 

In Utah a very dark form was found in company with a black Ibrm of Sceloporus 
iiseriuiiis on the black lava rock in Diamond Valley, between St. (Jeorge and the 
Upper Santa Clara crossing.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



The Crotaphytus collaris ranges from southern Missouri throuj^h ceu- 
tral Kansas to northern Nevada as its northern hmit; to Texas, as far as 
the mouth of the Rio Grande; to the city of Chihuahua and to south- 
eastern California, to the Sierra Nevada, beyond which it has not yet 
been found. Stejneger,^ remarks as to its distribution in this direc- 
tion: 

In spite of tbe fact that this species, in certain localities at least, ascends the 
mountains as high as 5,600 feet, it does not occur anywhere within the interior valley 
of California, nor does it pass heyond the San Bernardino range; in fjict, it does not 
seem to reach the coast anywhere; it is evidently an inland desert form.

External characters those of G. collaris as to width of head, large 
size of plates, division of suborbitals into a series of or 8 nearly e(]|ual 
plates. The scales on the chin and throat, however, are much smaller, 
those on the gular fold scarcely imbricated, and considerably less than 
those between the fore legs, instead of the same size, as in C. collaris 
and icislizemi. Scales on the inferior surface of legs carinated; 
mucronate rather smaller than in C. collaris. Scales of the head, and 
especially those on the border of the auditory meatus, less tubercular 
than in C. collaris; hence no serrate on border. 

General color in spirits, brownish gray; entire upj)er and outer sur- 
faces of head, body, limbs, and tail covered by a network of light ash.

the meshes quite regularly hexagonal, covering eight to twelve scales 
in width, and here and there abruptly dark brown, instead of the pale 
ground color. The chin with somewhat similar reticulati(ms in one 
specimen, in another the web coarser. The rest of the under parts 
throughout are yellowish. In a female specimen with inconspicuous 
femoral pores there is no trace of a collar on the neck as in collaris. 
In a male with the pores very large and black there is a dull blackish 
collar on the throat passing around the sides of the neck, but inter- 
rnpted above the middle of throat is bluish. There are no indications 
whatever of white spots, as in collaris. 

This species is quite similar in form to the C. collaris, but differs in 
the smaller gular and less prominent auricular scales. Its coloration 
is entirely different, lacking the double interrupted collar on the neck 
and the white spots. Any approach to the reticulation described is 
never seen iu collaris, except in very young specimens, and then much 
more irregular and combined with transverse light bands not found in 
reticulatus. 

This handsome species continues rare, the four specimens below 
mentioned being the only ones that have come under my observation.

Head narrow; its width scarcely two-thirds the distance from snout 
to ear. Supraorbital x)lates only moderately smaller than those in the 
middle and front of head. Of these plates there are three or four series 
between the middle of the orbit and eleven or twelve between their 
anterior extremities. Infraorbital chain composed of one long i)late, 
and one or two short ones at either end, about eight between the nos-

trils. Scales on belly subhexagonal ; ou the back smaller, rounded, 
tubercular, and not larger along the middle line. Scales of gular fold 
as large as those between the fore legs. Femoral pores about 18. 
Scales on the under surface of the feet hard and smaller; only obso- 
letely carinated or quite smooth; on the dorsal surface of the tail 
behind obsoletely keeled; elsewhere smooth. T.ail about twice the 
body; hind foot about two-fifths the body; no dark collar; general 
color a brownish yellow, with rather obsolete circular and pretty large 
blotches distributed pretty uniformly over the back and sides of head 
and body and exposed surfaces of the legs, the interspaces finely dot- 
ted with yellowish (on single scales). The tail is ringed alternately 
with brown and yellowish, the brown rings forming two blotches on each

side, generally separated narrowly above (sometimes confluent), but 
more or less confluent obsoletely below. The under parts are yellow- 
ish, the chin with broad longitudinal stripes of obsolete bluish (not 
reticulations). 

Sometimes the whitest dots are disposed so as to constitute an indis- 
tinct reticulation with the large rounded blotches in the meshes. There 
are generally two dorsal series of these blotches much larger than the 
others. There are usually more or less faint traces of transverse light 
bars on the back, especially toward the base of the tail, and sometimes 
on the flanks; in young specimens distinctly traceablfe as far as the 
head. 

In younger specimens, the light spotted reticulation is more continu-

ous, and in fact confluent. It is then generally of an ashy gray color 
(in alcohol), embracing large dark rounded or oval spots. Sometimes the 
ground color is ashy, with distant rounded spots. The yellow transverse 
bauds are very conspicuous, eight or ten from head to tail, and about 
forty on the tail. The supraorbital region is generally faintly margined 
internally with yellowish. An external margin extends to the nos- 
trils. There is a yellow band across the snout anterior to the nostrils 
and continuous with a yellow edge of the upper lip; this sends back a 
short branch between the nostrils. There is also a short yellow line 
from behind the eye. The chin is always streaked longitudinally with 
bluish. 

With a large series of specimens before me I must confess my inability 
to separate the C. gambelii of Baird and Girard from wisUzenii, the sup- 
posed diiferences not being constant. The absence of the light spots 
was the chief character of the type specimen, the greater size of the 
scales being due to its larger dimensions than the type of wisUzenii. 

The Grotaphytus fasciatus of Hallowell (type No. 2736) is precisely 
identical with the gambelii type, having very conspicuous transverse 
bauds. The white dots of typical wisUzenii, however, are very distinct. 

Dr. Stejneger has separated those individuals from California as a 
distinct species under the name of C. silus.^ The sole defiuition given 
is the following: 

"Similar to C. widizenii, but with the snout much sliorter and more truncate in 
profile; greatest width of head equal to or greater than distance from nostril to ear 
opening; distance between nostril and inner anterior orbital angle considerably less 
than vertical diameter of ear opening."' 

Were the above characters constant they would not alone character- 
ize a species of lizard, and examination of the series in the national 
collection shows that they are not constant nor correlated with any 
other character. I tind a more reliable peculiarity of the Pacilic repre- 
sentatives of the C. wisUzenii to be the character of the scales of the 
palm and sole, in which it resembles the two species already' described, 
C. coUaris and C reticulaius. This character, however, fades out and 
grades into the typical condition, even in Californian individuals. Thus 
specimens with palm and solar scales keeled are Cat. Nos. 8157, U581, 
11757, 11790, and 12GG3. The keels are not so strong in Cat. Nos. 2685, 
2717, and 2722. They are wanting in Cat. Nos. 8032 and 14195 ; all from 
the Pacitic region. Specimens taken by myself near Pyramid Lake, 
Nevada, have the subdigital scales keeled and mucronate. The ground 
color is dark, and it is crossed by light orange crossbars, which inclose 
subquadrate areas. In one specimen these areas tend to be broken up 
into large oval spots. In the type of C. cojjei, from the southern part 
of Lower California, the subdigital lamelhe are equally cariuate aud 
mucronate, and the quadrate color areas consist of from six to nine 
round spots.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



We Lave here, tbeu, a tendency to tbe formation of a race, Avliicli is 
not sufiticiently pronounced to liave produced a subspecies. 

The Crotaphytus uyislizenii belongs to tbe fauna of the Great Basin 
division of tbe central region, ranging into tbe northern part of the 
Souoran and into tbe southern part of the Pacific. 1 found it common 
as far north as Pyramid Lake, in northwest Nevada, and Dr. Wortman 
sent me specimens from the Bruneau River, in southwest Idaho. It 
does not range nearly so far east as tbe C. collaris, not passing, so far 
as known at present, tbe Pecos River of Texas. 

This is a very active species, and is more or less carnivorous in its 
habits. I took from the stomach of one a fully grown Ufa stanshuriana.

Remarks. 



• Toung. 

As to the food of tliis species Dr. Stejueger remarks: 

The ferocity and greed of this species is well illustrated by several of the .speci- 
mens caught. Thus the stomach of a young male (No. 18291) was found to contain 
two full-grown lizards, Uia stanhitriana, while an adult female (No. 18276) whfen 
opened gave up one full-grown horned toad, Phrynosoma platyrhinos, besides rem- 
nants of a grown specimen of her own species. 

The habits of Crotaphytus wislizenii are giveu by Dr. Merriam' as 
follows : 

The leopard lizard is abundant in most, if not all, of the Lower Sonorau deserts 
of the Great Basin, from southern California eastward across southern Nevada to 
Arizona and southAvestorn ITtah. While properly belonging to the lower Sonoran 
zone, it ranges up a, certain distance into the Upper Sonoran, occurring farther 
north and higher on the mountain sides than eitlier CalUsaurua or DipsoauMvus, and 
usually a little higher even than Cnemidophorus. 

It was found in abundance in all of the Lower Sonoran deserts traversed, from the 
Mohave Desert, Panamint and Death valleys, Ash Meadows, the Amargosa Desert, 
Indian Spring, Pahrump, and Vegas valleys to the Great Bend of the Colorado, and 
thence northerly through the valleys of the Virgin and Muddy, across the north- 
west corner of Arizona to the Santa Clara Valley in Utah, and Pahranagat and 
Meadow Creek valleys in Nevada. The upper limit of its range was not reached except 
in a few places, as indicated by the following localities. It was abundant through 
Antelope Valley, at the extreme west end of the Mohave Desert, ranging thence 
northerly through the wash or open canyon leading to Tchachapi Valley. (It was 
not seen in Tehachapi Valley, which is not strange, as a sharp, cold wind blew the 
only day we were there.) It ranges completely over Walker Pass (altitude of divide 
1, 550 meters, or 5,100 feet) and is common in Owens Valley, ranging as far north at 
least as Bishop Creek, and as high as 1,980 meters (6,500 feet) along the west slope 
of the White and Inyo mountains (opposite Big Pine). On the east side of the White 
Mountains it is common in Deep Spring and Fish Lake valleys, and was found on the 



' North American Fauna, No. 7, 1893, p. 167. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 261 

northwest slope of Moimt iMagrnder (below Pigeon Spring) as high as 1,980 meters 
(6,500 feet). It was seen at the same elevation in Tule Canyon, but does not reach the 
Mount Magruder plateau (altitude about 2,450 meters, or 8,000 feet). Coming up 
through Grapevine Canyon from the northwest arm of Death A'ailey it spreads over 
Sarcobatus Flat, and asceuds the south slope of Gold Mountain a little higher than the 
creosote bush (Larrca), which stops at about 1,640 meters (or .5,400 feet) on the most 
favorable southwest exposures. It is common in Oasis Valley (coining in from botli 
Sarcobatus Flat and the Amargosa Desert), and doubtless ranges over most of the 
Ralston Desert. It was found on the Desert, Timpahute, and Pahranagat mountains, 
as well as the intervening deserts, and on Pahroc Plain, aud thence easterly across 
Meadow Creek Valley and the Juniper Mountain plateau (along the boundary between 
Nevada and Utah) to the Escalaute Desert in Utah, and thence southerly through 
the sage brush to Mountain Meadows and the Santa Clara Valley. It was common 
on the Argus and Pananiiut mountains, and on the latter was taken as high as 1,610 
meters (5,300 feet) near wild Rose Spring, and may range higher. 

Croiaphytus wisUzenii, in company with two other Great Basin lizards (Ciiemido- 
2)liorus tigris aud Ula stanshuriana), two desert birds {Harporhynclms lecontei and 
CampylorhyuchHS hrinnieicapilJiif<), the antelope or white-tailed squirrel {Spermophi- 
liis leucurus), aud a number of desert plants (among which may be mentioned the 
tree yucca, Yucca arhorescens, Tetradymia spinosa, T. comosa, Lyciiim andersoni, L. 
cooperi, Hyinenoclea salsola, JJriogonitm fasciculatum, and Ephedra nevadensis) passes 
over the low summit of Walker Pass (altitude 1,550 meters, or 5,100 feet), and 
descends westerly to Kern Valley on the west slope of the Sierra. From Kern Val- 
ley Croiaphytus wislisenii ranges southward to Havilah, if not to Walker Basin. 

The leopard lizard is cliiefly a vegetarian, feeding on the blossoms and leaves of 
plants ; but is also carnivorous, devouring the smaller lizards, horned toads, and even 
its own kind, besides large numbers of insects, as determined by the examination of 
many stomachs. In the Argus Range Dr. Fisher surprised <me in the act of swal- 
lowing a scaly lizard (,SceIoporus) two-thirds its own size. 

In many lizards, as well known, the male assumes a special coloration during the 
breeding season. The present species is a notable exception, the male remaining 
the same, while the female undergoes a remarkable change. The whole under sur- 
face aud sides of the tail become deep salmon or even salmon red, and the sides of the 
body assume the same color, either uniformly or in blotches. The red markings on 
the sides usually begin as spots, which soon unite to form transverse stripes. The 
central part of the back is not affected by the change, aud the dark markings on the 
sides remain distinct. None were seen in this condition until May 20, when the first 
red one was found on Pahroc Plain, Nevada, but dozens were seen afterwards in 
Pahranagat Valley, Indian Spring Valley, the Amargosa Desert, Tule Canyon, and 
numerous other localities. The change does not take place till late in tlie develop- 
ment of the egg. Many pairs were observed in copulation in Diamond and the Upper 
Santa Clara valleys, ITtah, and thence northward to Mountain Meadows and the 
Escalante Desert, and westerly across the Juniper Mountains to Meadow Creek Val- 
ley from May 17 to 19, but no trace of the red coloration had appeared. The red 
individuals were always found to contain large eggs, generally measuring from 12 
to 15 mm. in length, with the coriaceous shell already formed.

aucl imbricated and iiearlj^ equal. Tail conical, shorter tlian the body, 
with very short whorls. Claws very thick and strong, anterior much 
larger. Ears not concealed. Nostrils superolateral, in line with can- 
thus rostralis. Tongue fleshy, with ten inferior terminal oval sessile 
pads. Palatine teeth distinct. Palate scarcely scooped out between 
j)Osterior nares, which are farther back than in Crotaphytus. Posterior 
teeth (especially lower) with five lobes; anterior almost to very end of 
jaw, with three. 

This genus is allied to Uta, and an approach to it is made by the JJta 
thalassina Cope. 

The following description of the osteology of this genus is based on 
a skeleton of the S. ater, belonging to the U. S. National Museum. 

The premaxilliary has a long spine above and a transverse posterior 
border below with the anteriorly directed button process. The nasals 
are well develoi^ed and distinct in spite of the large size of the nares. 
Frontal entire, rather narrow, grooved on the middle line below, and 
including pineal foramen, which touches the coronal suture. Parietals 
divided, perhaps abnormally in specimen, Supraoccipital loosely 
attached, but fused with exoccipitals. Prefrontals large, not extend- 
ing over orbits; lachrymals small, in contact with jugal. Postfroutal 
distinct, small. Apex of i)Ostorbital cartilaginous, inferior face in long 
contact with jugal and supratemporal. Paroccipital not large; parie- 
toquadrate arch well separated from exoccipital. Postoptic not reach- 
ing frontal, superior extremity expanded backward and forward. 
Petrosal very short above, prolonged below, inferior groove looking 
laterally. Fenestra ovalis and foramen nervi octavi sunk in deep fosste. 
Vomers entirely separated from maxillaries, not produced, but sepa- 
rated by a groove behind. Palatines with a short maxillary process. 
Palatine foramen moderate; pterygoids divaricating from each other 
outward. Ectopterygoid produced downward at the posterointernal 
angle. Pterygoids grooved from basipterygoids backward on internal 
side. Quadrate with two conchs, the internal one flat. The epistape- 
dial cartilage is largely ossified. 

Presphenoid a slender rod; sphenoid and basioccipital confluent. 
Occipital condyle with exoccipital elements slightly marked above. 

In the mandible Meckel's cartilage is completely inclosed. The 
splenial is produced biit little beyond the splenial foramen. Coronoid 
extended a little anteriorly at base on external face of ramus, and a 
little farther on the inner side. Dentary extending as far back as 
coronoid. Articular and surangular distinct. 

The premaxillary and anterior maxillary teeth are simple; the other 
maxillaries have two or three denticles anteriorly and one posteriorly. 
In the dentary bone the teeth (except in front) have two denticles on 
each edge. 

The hyoid apparatus displays a pair of parallel but separate second 
ceratobrauchials about half as long as the first ceratobranchials. Cera-

tobyals slightly expanded i)roximally, articulated at end of moderately 
long hypoliyals. 

The vertebric display a zygosphenal articulation. Five cervicals dis- 
play free intercentra, and four of them have no ribs. Eibs extending 
to sacrum. The two sacral centra and diapophyses are distinct, but 
the second diapophysis has a median longitudinal groove. Caudal 
centra of the distal half of the tail segmented, and possessed for the 
middle of the length of double diapophyses, between which the fissure 
passes. Diapophyses long on basal third of tail. Neural spines low 
everywhere; on the caudal vertebrai they stand at the posterior end, 
and send a keel to the anterior end, where it is elevated into a low 
anterior spine. Chevron l)ones intercentral. Four sternal ribs and 
two from the xiphoid rod. 

Scapula very short, with a large superior proscapula. Coracoid with 
two notches. Sternum wide and emarginate posteriorly, spreading the 
xiphoid rods far apart. Xo fontanelle. 

Pelvis with the pubis transverse and the pectineal process external. 
Ischia rather slender, with a short symphysis, and each with a long 
tuberosity. 

This genus is remarkable for the combination of characters it dis- 
plays. The zygosphenal articulation allies it to Dipsosaurus and the 
larger Iguanid.e, but the separated ceratobranchials, and the wide 
sternum are like that of the Phryuosomas, with the exception of the 
fontanelles. The transverse pubes have a similar significance. 

Of the habits of the species of Sauromalns, Dr. Stejneger remarks:' 

It Las long been suspected that these lizards live on vegetable food, in fact, Dr. 
Streets' statement {loc. cU.) as to the nature of their excreta' made it almost certain; 
but, to remove all doubt, I had the stomach of one of the large specimens (collected 
by Mr. Townsend) opened, and Prof. W. B. Barrows, of the U. S. Department of Agri- 
culture, had the kindness to submit the contents to one of the experts in that line 
for examination. He reports that the contents are exclusively vegetable and that 
the numerous seeds are those of a malvaceous plant, probably Sphceralcea Jiastiilata. 

Two species of this genus are known, which differ as follows: 

Nuchal scales spiny, the largest almost as large as largest preauricular spines; dorsal 
scales ending posteriorly in a long obtuse spine; dorsal scale rows average 16 to 
a head length; number of ventral scale rows from gnlar fold to anus averages 
118; number of scales round thickest part of tail averages 50; femoral pores, 
12-15; larger average length, 510 mm. (Stejneger) S.hispidus. 

Nuchal scales tubercular or smooth, none of them half as large as largest preauric- 
ular spines; dorsal scales squarish, smooth, without spine; dorsal scale rows 
average 32 to a head length; number of ventral scale rows from gular fold to 
anus averages 165; number of scales round thickest part of tail averages 76; 
femoral pores, 15-18; size medium, length 314 mm. (Stejneger) S.ater.

though in life they are said to be " marked with one, two, or three 
large, rounded, or irregular grayish blotches somewhere on their body."' 
In addition to the type si)ecimen I have before me three others nearly 
as large, collected by Mr. Charles H, Townsend in the same locality.

This enormous lizard is closely allied to the much smaller species 
which inhabits the arid regions on the mainland to the north of the 
Gulf of California, namely, Sanromahis atcr, with wlii(!h it has been 
confounded, but is readily distinguished by the characters given in the 
above diagnosis. In order to better emphasize the differences I here- 
with give the corresponding diagnosis of the old species. 

In all probability the young of Sauromalus hls2)i<liis is much less 
spiny than the old ones, but the scales would be much larger than in 
corresponding specimens of JS. ater and their number consequently 
smaller. (Stejneger.)

Body very stout and form heavy; belly large; limbs (including claws) 
stout, short, and thick ; tail scarcely larger than body, very much thick- 
ened and depressed at base. 

Top and sides of the head covered with nearly equal subhexagonal 
tubercular scales, only a little smaller on the supraorbital region and 
cheeks. Orbits bounded inferiorly by a chain of about ten nearly eipial 
scales. Ear conspicuous, its anterior edge dentate. About twenty

rows of scales along a broad median si^ace of the back inncli larger 
tliau more laterally 5 those on the nape as large as those on the top of 
the head; they are imbricated and angularly tubercnlated, but not 
carinate. The scales on the sides of body and beneath from chin to 
anus are excessively minute, almost like shagreen, and arranged in 
quincunx. The scales, limbs, and upper and lateral surfaces of the tail 
faintly carinate. Femoral pores filled with a greenish mass. No anal 
plates. 

Width of head nearly equal to the distance from the nose to ear. 

In the young the general color is olive green, absolutely marbled 
with dusky (or else dusky, spotted with olive green), with five broad 
transverse bars between the head and tail. These bars are composed 
of single red and yellow scales intermixed, and are vscarcely distinguish- 
able. The tail is black, with three or four broad rings of yellow, dotted 
with red; much more distinct than the dorsal bars. The under parts 
are pea green, dotted with black points, the chin and between the fore 
legs with red. With increasing age these bars disappear to a greater 
or less degree until the general color above is reddish olive obscurely 
reticulated with darker; the sides and beneath dotted with black, with 
an occasional light dot on the back. 

This species differs from those of Grotapliytus in the very heavy, squat 
form (equal to that of many Phrynosomas), and short limbs and tail. 
The ventral scales and those along the middle of the back are much 
larger than those more lateral, and all those beneath are much smaller. 
The anterior margin of the ear is strongly dentate instead of only 
crenate. There are no larger post- anal plates. 

From Dipsoscmrus (JorsaJis it is known by the obese proportions, 
the absence of the single line of keeled scales on the back, and the 
absence of carination on the upper scales generally. The tail is 
depressed at the base, not compressed. The belly and gular scales are 
excessively minute instead of quite large. 

Dr. Stejneger gives the following table of details and measurements:

Dr. Stejneger remarks as to the distribution of this species: 

Beyond rather vague statements as to the general distribution of tbe present 
species very little exact information in regard to its range lias been published. It 
is evident that tbe localities from which the expedition brought home its speci- 
mens — almost four times as many as in any museum before — form the center of the 
geographical range of the "chuck-walla." From here it extends soutlnvard along 
the Colorado River for an unknown distance, ranging westward into the Colorado 
Desert, and eastward ahmg the Gila into Arizona. Dr. Merriam has now, for the 
first time, definitely demonstrated its occurrence in southern Nevada and south- 
western Utah. 

The habits of Sauromalus ater are described as follows by Dr. Mer- 
riam in his report on the results of the Death A^ alley expedition : 

The "chuck-walla," by which name this remarkable lizard is universally known 
to both Indians and whites (except the Mormons), inhabits many of the Lower 
Sonorau Desert ranges in the southern part of the Great Basin from the Mohave and 
Colorado deserts easterly across southern Nevada to Arizona, and north to the south- 
western corner of Utah. It is the largest lizard of the desert region except the Gila 
Monster (/jfe/oderma), which only slightly exceeds it in size. The broad body is black 
or blackish, and the large blunt tail is usually marbled with white or entirely 
white. It was generally found on lava or other dark rocks with which its coloration 
harmonizes. It is a vegetarian, feeding entirely, so far as our observations go, on 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 269 

the buds aud flowers of i)limts, with the additiou sometiiiiuB of a few leaves. It ia 
much prized bj" the Pauamint Indians as an article of food. A number were eaten 
by members of our expedition, and the flesh was reported to be tender aud palatable. 

Specimeus were secured by the Death Valley expedition in the Pana- 
miut Range, the Amargosa Canyon, on a lava knoll on the west side of 
Pahrump Valley, California, and in the Lower Santa Clara Valley in 
Utah. In the latter locality they are common both along the canyon of 
the Lower Santa Clara and among the red sandstone cliffs near the 
village of St. George, and are called " alligators " by the Mormons. Dr. 
Fisher found them in considerable numbers in the Argus Eange, west 
of Panamint Valley, and examined a number of stomachs, in which he 
found the following plants (either howers or foliage, or both): Dalca 
fremoiiUi, Leptosyne higelovii, Amsinckia tessellata, Lotusj jSphct'ralcea 
mum'oaua, and Eiihedra viridis.

Another variety is darker above, varied with red, and with few or no 
light spots on the back, which has, besides, two distinct series of dorsal 
blotches from head to tail. 

The head is much depressed, nearly as broad as long; the muzzle 
wide and rounded. The width is equal to distance from snout to end 
of large occipital plate. The labials and rostrals form a projecting 
horizontal shelf; the series distinctly visible from above. They are 



CKOCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES, 271 

imbricated oblique, as in the allied genera IloJhroolia. There are seven 
large oblique upper labials. The i)lates margining the lower labials 
behind are decidedly larger than those on the cheeks. There are about 
180 oblicjue series of scales from head to above anus, arranged in rather 
irregular oblique series. The tail is rather longer than the body, much 
depressed and flattened to the extreme tij), and tapering regularly from 
near the base. The hind feet are nearly or quite half the head and body, 
the free portion of longest toe nearly twice the length of cephalic plates. 
There are 14 or 15 femoral pores. 

The colors and markings of this species are quite similar to those of 
Holbroolia texana. The ground color in the type si>ecimen is a pale 
yellowish gray, with ten series of dull blotches on the lower part of the 
back, becoming confluent on the tail and encircling this as a series of five 
or six rings, which are intensely black beneath. The five more anterior 
ones are blotches beneath, not spots. The most of the back and sides 
is uniformly and rather finely marked with apijroximated rounded 
lighter spots. The legs are banded transversely with dusky. The 
under parts are yellowish white; the whole posterior face of the thigh 
similar, with a distinct stripe of dark plumbeous, bounded above by a 
yellowish line, part of the ground color. In Holbroolia this line is 
bordered immediately above by the ashy gray of the upper ground 
color. 

In the male there is a blue i)atch on each .side of the belly (sep- 
arated by twelve or fourteen scales) and not extending on the colored 
part of the sides. In this are situated two indigo-black patches on each 
side; subtriangular, broadest and truncate at the base inferiorly, and 
running obliipiely forward and uj^ward. The hinder one (the largest) 
has the posterior and inferior angle extended backward, so as to consti- 
tute a kind of crescent, with the aiitero-inferior face an obtuse isosceles 
angle, the i)ostero-superior a regular concavity. These two marks on 
each side occupy about the middle of the space between the fore and 
hind legs. The anterior runs rather farther up on the sides than the 

posterior. 

Oat. No. 4121 differs in having the ground color darker; the back with 
ten series of distinct dorsal blotches, about ten from head to above anus. 
The light spots are scarcely appreciable above, more so on the sides, 
where they show traces of having been reddish. The posterior augle 
of the hinder black blotch is much extended, reaching nearly to the 
groin and much longer than the anterior angle. The head beneath is 
light plumbeous and, with the jaws, varied with bluish. 

In life it is probable that there is a good deal of red on the sides and 
back. 

The female lacks the blue on the side of belly, and but faint indica- 
tion, if any, of the black marks. There is a tendency to a series of dusky 
subquadratic blotches on the sides, more than in the male, and extend- 
ing along the side of the tail. There are in some specimens oblique

bars oil each side of the cbiu and oue or two ou the side of the neck 
next to the shoulder. 

The description of Callisaurus draconoides by Blainville is too incom- 
plete to permit us to determine if it is identical with C. ventralis of 
Hallowell. The back is indicated as transversely banded, and the 
sides of the belly as with three spots, which scarcely applies to the 
ventrcais. The numerous specimens in the U. S. National Museum from 
Cape St. Lucas and La Paz enable us to determine it as the same. 

In external form and general apj)earance this species is so very 
similar to Holhroolcia texana as not to require any very elaborate 
descrii^tion. The most prominent points of distinction are seen in the 
excessively lengthened feet and distinct external auditory aperture. 
This is narrow, elliptical, and vertical; the borders smooth, or Avith a 
faint crenation anteriorly. The dentate processes of the lower eyelid 
are longer than in HolbrooMa; the plates on the chin smaller, as also 
the imbricated scales ou the anterior edge of the humerus. The scales 
on the sides are rather more rounded and paved, as well as a little 
smaller than those of the back. The feet are excessively lengthened; 
the hind foot very nearly or quite half the head and body; the toes 
very slender. The claws are all much longer, straighter, and more 
compressed than in Molbrookia texana. 

Three varieties or subspecies of the Callisaurus draconoides may be 
recognized, but they are not aufiSciently constant to be entitled to per- 
manent rank. They are represented, respectively, by specimens from 
the southern part of the peninsula of Lower California, from the 
northern part of the same, and from the southern part of Arizona. 
They are characterized as follows : 

I. A band of granular scales before as well as behind scales of collar. .Super- 
ciliary scales smaller, separated on the middle line; smaller scales before ear; 
collar scales pointed behind; three black lateral spots; legs shorter; wrist 

and hind foot not reaching end of muzzle C. d. draconoides. 

II. A baud of granular scales behind collar only. Superciliary scales equal froutals 
and in contact on middle line; larger scales before ear; legs longer; wrist 

beyond muzzle, hind foot mostly so C d. fjaljhii (Cope). 

III. No granular bands on throat. Small scales before ear; collar scales not pointed 
behind; two black spots on sides, the posterior proloniicd backward; feet 
long; wrist to beyond muzzle, hind foot equal or beyond muzzle.. C. d. ventralis.

In liis report oil tlie Eeptiles of the Death Valley Expedition Dr. 
Stejneger remarks, " It can be asserted with confidence that Callisaurus 
draconoides vcntraUs does not occur anywhere within the interior val- 
ley of California, not even in AValker basin. Not is there aiiy evidence 
to show that it occurs anywhere southwest of the San Bernardino 
range, within the boundary of the State of California." 

Dr. Merriam ^ gives the following descrijition of the habits of Calli- 
saurus draconoides ventralis : 

The gridiron-tailed lizard is the most characteristic reptiJe of the Lower Soiioran 
deserts of soutberu California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, and Arizona, 
whore it is almost universally distributed and very much more abundant than any 
other species. It iuhabits the open deserts and runs with great swiftness over 
the sand and gravel beds, carrying its tail curled up over its back as if afraid to 
let it touch the hot surface of the earth. It starts off at full speed, as if fired from 
a cannon, and sto^is with equal suddenness, thus escaping or eluding its enemies, 
the coyotes, hawks, and larger lizards. When running it moves so swiftly that the 
eye has difficulty in following, and when at rest its colors harmonize so well with 



' North American Fauna, No. 7, 1893, p. 171.

those of the desert that it can hardly be seen. The basal half of its tail is trans- 
versely barred nnderneath, and the bars are broad and distinct, suggesting the name 
here applied to the species in lieu of a better one. During the breeding season the 
males develop a conspicuous j)atch of metallic greenish-blue on the sides of the 
body and have the power of inflating a pinkish sac under the chin. 

The attitude of this lizard when at rest differs from that of most others, in that 
the knees and elbows stand out at right angles from the body, and are elevated to 
such a degree that they nearly reach the plane of the back. Like many other spe- 




cies, it has an odd habit of performing a singular gynmastic exercise, consisting in 
rapidly dropping and elevating the body with the knees held stiff at right angles to 
the trunk. 

This species feeds on insects and the blossoms and leaves of plants in about equal 
proportion ; at h)ast such was the case in the large number whose stomachs were 
examined. 

The gridiron-tailed lizard is common throughout the Mohave Desert proper, but 
docs not reach the extreme western end of the desert in Antelope \alley. which, 
owing to its greater altitude, passes out of the Lower Sonoran zone. It was last

seen in this direction .ibont 10 miles east of Liebre ranch. In tbo Avasb leading 
from the ]\Iobave Desert to Tebachapi Valley it was seen np to 1,030 meters (3,400 
feet) and may rauj^e higher. It is common in the Lower Sonorau zone at the 
south end of Owens Valley, and ranges np on the warm cost side of the valley as 
far as Big Pine. It is common throughout Panamint and Death valleys and in the 
Amargosa Desert. In Nevada it inhabits the deserts of the southern part of the 
State, from Ash Meadows easterly across Pahrump and Vegas valleys to the Great 
Bend of the Colorado, where it is very common, and ranges north through the val- 
leys of the Virgin and Lower Muddy (where it is abundant) to Pahranagat and 
Meadow Creek valleys. In western Nevada it comes through Graiievine Canyon 
(from the northwest arm of Death Valley), ranges easterly over Sarcobatus Flat, 
and ascends the warm south slope of Gold Mountain, with Larrea, to about 1,640 
meters (5,400 feet). In Utah it is common in the Lower Santa Clara Valley, but 
does not range up into the sagebrush or Upper Sonoran zone of the ujiper part of 
the valley. 

In Desert Valley, just east of the Pahroc Mountains, a form of this species was 
found which seems to be subspecihcally distinct from the ordinary type. It is much 
shorter and broader, with a shorter tail, and is bluish gray in color. It may be the 
same as the animal inhabiting the desert at Pyramid Lake, Nevada, which point is 
about 2- farther north than Desert Valley, though in the same zoological subzone, 
for the low altitude of a series of narrow and irregular deserts in western Nevada 
carries this zone much farther north than elsewhere. These specimens suggest the 
existence of a form peculiar to the upper division (or Graijia belt) of the Lower 
Sonoran zone, CaUisaitrua reniralis proper being closely restricted to the lower divi- 
sion (or Larrea belt) of the same zone.

A gular fold. Femoral pores present, pierced in an undivided scale. 
Superciliary scale tectiform. Ears exposed. Occipital small. N^ostrils 
superior, within the canthus rostralis. Upper labials oblique, angular. 
Tongue scarcely notched at the end; attached almost to the very tip. 
Cheek teeth tricuspid. Claws long, acute, with an internal excavation 
which produces a sharp edge, the base inclosed in a sheath of two large 
scales. A fringe of free scales on each side of some of the digits and 
on the external side of the sole. 

This interesting genus differs from CalHsaurus in the lateral instead 
of vertical direction of its claws, and in the presence of fringes on the 
borders of its digits and soles. The latter character occurs elsewhere 
in the Gecconian genus Ptenopus (Gray), which inhabits the deserts 
of South Africa, and in Phrynocephalus, a genus of Agamidjc which 
inhabits the deserts of Asia. As the genus Uma is also found in deserts 
it is ])robable that this structure has a direct relation to the mode of 
life of the animal. It is probably, like its allies, a swift runner, but 
rapid progress in the sand is very difficult. The long fringes of stiff 
scales aid the lizard materially in maintaining a foothold by their pene- 
trating the sand. It is interesting to iiud this structure present in two 
genera of such widely diverse affinity and habitat. I append a figure 
of the foot of the Ptoiopiis [jarnilns, taken from a specimen for the 
opportunity of studying which I am indebted to Dr. Alexander

elsewhere. The phites in the loreal region between the can thus rostralis 
and the labials in eight or nine rows; the labials, though imbricated, 
are little oblique, and have the outer edge flattened and vertical instead 
ofcarinated. Tlie pectinated processes of the lower eyelid are veiy 
large and close. The lower labials are margined internally by several 
series of llattened plates much larger than those on the middle line of 
chin, and larger than those on the cheeks, which diminish above. Tlie 
scales are excessively minute above, without appreciable difference in 
size. They are generally much as in Holhroolda and Cidlisanrus^ except 
that on the anteiior face of the humerus is one series of large, and three 
or four of rather smaller, scales conspicuously larger than those adja- 
cent to them. The scales anterior to the femoral pores are abruptly 
smaller than those on the anterior edge of the thigh, 
and scarcely larger than those behind the pores. 
Tlierc are seventeen or eighteen femoral pores. 

The body of this species is depressed, the head 
very broad and depressed, the profile plane ante- 
riorly, though sloping rapidly. The muzzle is more 
pointed than in the species of Callisaurns. The 
ear is narrow and vertical and concealed, excei>t 
for a short space below, by a fringe of three or four 
large flattened triangular scales situated on the 
extreme anterior edge of the aperture, with four or

Head from above. flie Central line of the breast are smaller than those 
nearer the shoulders.

The legs are long, the hind foot about two-fifths 
the head and body; the free portion of hind toe 
about as long as the cephalic plates. The forefingers are unequal ; the 
claws very long. The tail is evidently depressed to the leit; probably 
as long as body. 

The color of this species is a light pea-green above, marked uni- 
formly above by small spots of darker green, apparently arranged in 
ten series. Interspersed with these are a few whitish spots, which may 
perhaps be a lighter border behind of the green ones. The under jmrts 
are white, a single rounded black spot being visible on the extreme 
edge of the belly on either side, equidistant between fore and hind legs. 
The chin is marked sharply with a few oblique spots of light blue; the 
middle of the throat with more ' transverse ones of blue-black. The 
tail is broken off, and it is impossible to say whether there are any 
rings or black bands below. 

In general form this lizard differs much more from Callisaurus ven- 
tralis than the latter does from Rolbroolia texana. The former has a 
distinct ear opening, with the tympanic membrane very near the sur-

face, instead of being concealed, as in Ilolhroolia texana. The greater 
length of feet is specific rather than generic. 

The difference from CaJUsanriis vcntralis is seen first in the ear, which 
is deeper and concealed above by a fringe of large scales, wanting in 
the other. There are also several series of small tnbercles to the large 
plates of the cheeks, instead of the aural aperture being immediately 
behind these. From botli GaJUsaurus ventralis and Holhroolda ie.rana 
it differs in the nnich smaller and more numerous plates of the sui)ra- 
orbital regions ; the two well-defined rows of plates intervening between 
these, instead of only one indistinct one; the equality of the lateral and 
median plates in the snout frontal region; the absence of carina exter- 
nally on the upx)er labials, or at least their more vertical sides; the 
inequality of the middle and lateral scales on the breast; the abrupt 
difference in size of the scale on the under surface and anterior edge 
of humerus and femur (especially the latter), instead of a gentle gra- 
dation. The femoral pores are more numerous; the large occipital plate 
smaller and more encircled by small plates. Other differences would 
doubtless be appreciable in a larger specimen.

This sj)ecies is represented in the collections of the U. S. National 
Museum by ten specimens, of which five are adult, one half-grown and 
four young. The description of the squamation already given in the 
case of the V. scoparia applies in the main to this species, but there are 
many important differences, which I proceed to enumerate. 

The dorsal scales are very small and round, and not transversely 
diamond-shaped; in a specimen where the head and body measures 93 
mm., three and a half measure a millimeter, transversely. The large 
scales of the front of the humerus and femur are abrui^tly contrasted 
with the smaller ones of the inferior faces of the same regions, instead 
of graduating into them, as in the case in the IL scoparia. Thus there 
are fifteen rows of small scales anterior to the femoral pores, instead of 
only five or six, as in U. scoparia. The femoral pores number from 24 
to 28. In two specimens they are 24-24; in one, (?)-24; in two, 25-25; 
in one, 2G-27; in one, 27-28, and in one, 27-(?). This irregularity has 
no relation to age, as the young do not differ from the adults in this 
respect. The number of loreal rows of scales do not differ in the speci- 
mens, and the supraorbital scales are also uniformly less numerous than 
in the U. notata, numbering eleven and twelve rows. There is one well-

developed ro^y between the long .suborbital scale aud tlie superior 
labials and a few granular scales above it in two of the specimens, 
instead of the two well-developed rows in the U. scGparia. The end 
scales of the suborbital series are somewhat variable in number and 
character, but there is usually but one keeled scale posterior to the 
long median scale in place of the three of the TJ. scoparia. The feet are 
of about the same length as in the U. scoparia, measuring one-third the 
length of the head and body, or less; and they are thus distinctly 
shorter than in the U. notata. The claws of the manus are not exca- 
vated nearly so far proximad nor so deeply as in the U. scoparia, nor 
are thej^ twisted so that the edges are directed outward, as in the latter. 
In coloration this species differs widely from the U. scoparia. On the

gular region, instead of the two conspicuous transverse black crescents, 
there are longitudinal narrow blackish lines. There are six or seven 
black spots on the distal half of the under side of the tail, of which 
the anterior are small and transverse, the i^osterior longer and covering 
the entire inferior surface. The black lateral spot is large and is entirely 
inferior; its outline varies from subcircular to subquadrate. The color 
of the superior surfaces differs from that of the XL scoparia, in that the 
black ground remains in the form of longitudinal lines, of which there 
are ten or eleven. The interspaces are broken up into discoidal spaces 
of light yellowish-brown, their isolation being most complete near the 
middle line. Each discoidal space has a rusty or rufous central spot 
in place of the black spot of the TJ. scoparia, and it is therefore less dis-

tiiict tliiiii ill the latter. Oii the sides of the neck aud body and on the 
superior aspect of the tail the black is broken up into small spots. 

In the young the discoid areas are not well outlined, and the central 
spots are not distinct and are blackish. The ground-color tends to run 
more into irregular longitudinal lines. The paler color appears rather 
as the ground, aud it is pea-green • rather than the brownish yellow of 
the adult. 

On the posterior faces of both femur and tibia, proximad, there is a 
patch of enlarged keeled scales, with the keels and their mucronate 
apices directed upu-ard. On the lower anterior border of the humerus 
a row of enlarged scales presents produced apices, which are recurved, 
forming a serrate line, most prominent near the elbow. 

The tail is very wide and is much depressed for some distance from 
the base, and only the terminal i)art is cylindric. Along the widened 
portion the lateral scales are imbricate, and have recurved apices, 
giving a rough appearance. The median superior scales are like the 
dorsals, smooth, not imbricate, and rounded.

UMA INORNATA Cope. 
Uma inornata Copr, American Naturalist, XXIX, 1895, p. 939. 

Specimen Cat. No. 10500 represents perhaps a fourth species, which 
agrees in most respects with the U. ritfopunctata, but differs in the num- 
ber of femoral pores and in coloration; is immature and about the size 
of the one which served as the type of the U. notata of Uaird. It was 
caught on the Colorado Desert of San Diego County, California, at a 
distance of from 100 to 140 miles south of the Mohave Desert of Ari- 
zona where the type of the U. notata was taken. 

In the character of its coloration it resembles the U. notata and the 
young of the U. rufopunctata, except in the absence of the conspicuous 
black spot on each side of the belly, which is present in every individual 
of this genus hitherto discovered. \n its squaiuation it resembles 
rather the TJ. rnfopunctata than the U. notata, aud like it, unlike the

latter, it lias a short liiud foot, wliicb is only one-third the length of the 
head and body. It agrees with the same species in the reduced num- 
ber of loreal and supraorbital scales, and the larger number of small 
scales on the inferior face of the femur. There are seven black spots 
on the inferior side of the tail, the anterior smaller than the posterior.

General form depressed. Prebrachial region rather elongate; poste- 
rior part of abdomen expanded posteriorly. Tail of medium length, 
depressed throughout, and very wide for the basal half, equaling at its 
base the width at the groin. The fore limb extended posteriorly just 
reaches the groin; the end of the longest toe of the hind limb when 
extended reaches the posterior border of the orbit. The length from 
the extremity of the muzzle to the axilla equals the length from the

latter to the posterior border of the femur. Tlic upper lip has a sub- 
acute median angle whicli projects beyond the lower lip. The profile 
descends in a nearly straight line to the depressed and slightly promi- 
nent border of the muzzle. The fifth finger extends a little beyond 
the extremity of the first, and the extremity of the fifth toe marks a 
])oiiit between the extremities of the first and second. 

There are thirty-two femoral pores in a continuous line and a second 
series immediately posterior to it, in which we can count fifteen addi- 
tional pores. Of these, ten near the middle of the series are consecutive. 

There are two roAvs of rather small frontal scales which posteriorly 
follow the orbital border, and are separated from the rather small occii)- 
ital by two rows of smaller scales. There are about eleven rows of 
scales on the supraorbital region, which are smaller than the frontals, 
excepting three rows inside the center of the region. The scales on 
the muzzle are larger, nine rows intervening between the canthal rows 
at the middle. Four rows between the nostrils. Canthal row consist- 
ing of one long and one small scale, the latter below the nostril. Six 
loreal rows. Six infraorbital plates, the third below the orbit and 
much longer than the others, and, like them, keeled. Three supercilia- 
ries in front of and three posterior to the median or key scale. Supe- 
rior labials oblicpie, over]api)ing each other forward above and obtusely 
keeled longitudinally. Scales of the quadrate region rather small. 
Auricular meatus protected by six elongate free scales which spring 
from the anterior border. The meatus is about equal in vertical diam- 
eter to the eye slit. Inferior labial scales smooth, in contact below 
with a series of infralabials which exceed them in size, which become 
posteriorly several rows. Gular scales small, a little larger at the mid- 
dle of the throat. All the scales of the head smooth. 

The dorsal scales are small, smooth, smaller than those of the belly, 
and transversely diamond-shaped. The scales of the inferior surface 
are smooth, and are arranged in open chevrons with the angle forward. 
The greater number are parallelogrammic, but the anterior are regu- 
larly diamond-shaped. Those of the anterior pectoral region are 
reduced in size, and are smaller than those of the posterior gular 
region. The latter are similar to the edge of the collar, except four 
scales in the middle, which are a little larger. Collar with uniform 
border. There are some longitudinal folds on the side of the neck, but 
as the specimen has been somewhat dried, it is not certain whether 
they are present in life. The scales on the anterior faces of the 
humerus and femur are enlarged and their acute apices are free and 
more or less recurved. They graduate into the other scales on the 
humerus, which are rather larger than those of the dorsal region. On 
the femur they graduate into those of the inferior side, which are larger 
than those of the dorsum, but are separated rather abruptly from those 
of the superior face, which equal those of the dorsum. The scales of 
the tibia are about cijual to those of the belly. A few rows on the 



284 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

iuteiual border are keeled and have tlieir elongate apices directed 
upward. With this exception the scales of the limbs are not keeled. 

The inferior scales of the digits are not keeled or conspicuously 
augulated. The lateral rows are produced into free flat spinous proc- 
esses on the three middle fingers, and ou the adjacent (inner) side of 
tlie fifth. On the toes the fringes are conspicuous on the third and 
fourth, and are wanting on the first and flftli toes. On the second they 
arc present, but less elongate on the side next tlie third, and on tlie 
inner side are only present near the extremity. They extend ou the 
external border of the sole to near the base of the fiftli digit. The ter- 
minal exterior scale is much enlarged and folds over the inner edge of 
the basal lialf of the claw. It is obliquely truncated, distally present- 
ing a prominent angle at the internal corner, which is pinched and 
acute. The superior scale in like manner enfolds the external edge of 
the unguis, and lias a pinched external border which terminates in an 
acute apex. The two form a conspicuous basal slieath. The inferior 
plate is longitudinally ridged, while the superior is smooth. Each 
ungual slieath is excavated for tlie distal half of its internal inferior 
surface, giving a thin, sliarj) interior edge to the claw. 

Measurements. — Total length, 217 mm.; length to vent, 100 mm.; 
length to line of axilliB, 47 mm.; length to collar, 30 mm.; length to 
line of anterior border of ear, 21 mm. ; length of anterior limb, 45 mm. ; 
length of anterior foot, 17 mm.; length of posterior limb, from groin, 
77 mm.; length of tibia, 27 mm.; length of posterior foot, 30 mm;; 
width of head at auricular meatus, 10 mm.; width at shoulders, 23 mm.; 
width of base of tail, 18 miii. 

The ground color of the upper regions is black, and of the lower, 
apparently white. The dorsal region is covered with disciform round 
spots of white (or jjossibly yellow or red in life), whose borders nearly 
or in some places quite touch. In the center of each disk is a black 
spot. The pattern resembles that of the pieces of a buttonmaker's 
refuse. On the neck and occiput the pale disks become confluent, and 
the superior surface of the head, from the posterior border of the orbits 
forward is a uniform dirty white. On the ends the pale disks are con- 
fluent, leaving series of rather numerous small black spots. On the 
upper surface of the tail the disks are confluent longitudinall}^, leaving 
some longitudinal black lines. The greater part of the tail is pale, and 
is very indistinctly marked. The limbs are pale, with minute black 
specks on the superior aspect of the humerus and femur. On the 
throat is a black crescent, with the horns turned anteriorly and termi- 
nating below the external meatus of the ear. Posterior to this is another 
black crescent of greater transverse extent, whose horns terminate 
between those of the anterior crescent and the auditorymeatus. Sides 
of head and neck black spotted. Inferior surfaces unspotted, with the 
following excei)tions: On each side, halfway bet Aveen axilla and groin, 
a large subround black spot. On the inferior surface of the tail, on the

distal third, four black spots. The anterior is round, and the others 
increase in length to the fourth, which is elongate. 

This species, the most peculiarly marked lizard of North America, 
differs in numerous respects from its congener, the Uma notata, with 
which I at one time identified it. Thus, the number of femoral pores is 
more than twice as great; the labial plates are keeled; the digits and 
claws are shorter, and the latter are not excavated fartln^r proximally ; 
the transition from the small to the large scales of the humerus and 
femur is gradual and not abrupt; the fringes of the borders of the eye- 
lids are of equal length, the inferior not being longer, as in U. notata; 
and finally, the fringes of the digits and sole are longer in the U. 
acoparia than in the U. no fata.

far as Kansas inclusive. It is abunxlant in Texas, but is wanting from 
the Pacific and Lower Californian districts, where its i)lace is suiJidied 
by Callisaurus. The species are not numerous, and are as follows:

Hind feet lengthened, nearly half the head and body. Femoral pores 
sixteen or seventeen. Color above, olive gray. The back with ten series 
of dorsal rounded blotches, which on the tail become rings ; black below, 
although frequently only obsoletely indicated. Posterior half of sides

witli two black crescents, widening below; the posterior doable its own 
width from the groin, from which sometimes springs a third. The 
interstices and borders lighter than the gronnd color on the sides 
above; below and on the belly blue. Chin mottled with blue and Avhite. 
Sides anterior to the crescent spotted with whitish. Thighs with a 
plumbeous stripe behind. 

In this species the scales of the entire back are rather larger than 
those on the sides for a width of at least twenty scales. The number 
in a line from occiput to above anus is at least one hundred and sixty. 
The hind foot is rather more than two-fifths the head and body; the 
free portion of hind toe one and one-half times the head. There are 
seven upper labials on each side. The tail is very mnch depressed to 
the tip. 

The upper parts of this species are of an olivaceous or reddish gray. 
The back Avith the series of nine or ten small, dusky rounded blotches, 
sometimes very obsolete; continued on the upper surface of the tail as 
a single series of uudulating or somewhat W-shai^ed bars. All these 
marks are suffused behind with a lighter tint than the ground color. 
In the posterior half of each side are three parallel black crescents, 
extending from back to belly, the convexity posterior; the extremities of 
opposite ones separated above and below by ten or twelve scales; of 
these the posterior starts from the groin and is (£uite indistinct; the two 
others are widest inferiorly (where they are truncate), and taper almost 
to a point on the back. The borders and intervals of these crescents 
are generally yellowish, lighter than the ground color. Anterior to the 
crescents the sides are conspicuously and quite uniformly marked with 
rounded, yellowish spots, almost in a network of the ground color; 
they sometimes have a darker areola. The under parts are yellowish, 
suffused with greenish on the sides of belly (especially about the black 
marks) and sometimes across it. The head has sometimes a greenish 
or light i)lumbeous tinge; the under part of the head is faintly blue, 
varied with yellowish. The under surface of tlie tail shows from three 
to eight conspicuous, transverse, large bluish or black spots in contin- 
uation of rings encircling the tail, which are quite indistinct above and 
laterally. The posterior surface of the thigh shows a broad, longitudi- 
nal plumbeous strii)e, and below it a yellowish one, cutting off a second 
fainter lead-colored one, sometimes wanting. 

The rings around the tail are more indistinct laterally than above. 

The female has a series of plumbeous blotches along the sides, nearly 
as broad as high, subcresceutic, with the tips truncate and close. 
There are two oval spots on the side of the belly, and in its white 
ground, just below two of the lateral blotches mentioned. 

Sometimes there is a trace of an additional crescent (or even two) 
anteriiU' to the others. This, however, is only ftiiutly indicated; is not 
continuous, and does not extend on the belly. 



288 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1.S98. 

Professor liaird (listing iiislied a llolbrooJda affinis as distinct from 
the H. texana. but I find the following note in liis manuscrix^t: 

The diiference between the typical II. texana autl the supposed species II. affinia 
will he fouud indicated, as far as I have been able to appreciate them, under th(5 
latter head. I must confess, however, a very groat difficulty in assigning many 
specimens to one rather than to another of these species. 

He then defines the typical H. texana as follows : 

Legs rather short, the hind foot little more than cue-third length of head and 
body; femoral pores, twelve or thirteen. Above olive gray, with ten dorsal series of 
rounded dusky blotches, which on the tail behind anus become six or eight rings, 
intensely black below. Posterior half of sides with ten long crescents widening 
below, the posterior twice its width from the groin; the interspace and border lighter 
on the sides above, but below and on the belly blue. .Sides anterior to the crescent 
s^iotted Avith whitish. Chin strongly mottled with blue and white; thigh behind 
with a longitudinal plumbeous stripe; a black spot on shoulder, and one or two 
behind it on humerus. Female with the lateral crescents ^replaced by oval spots. 

In some specimens of H. texana (Cat. ISTo. 20(39) there is a tendency to 
a continuation of the lateral crescent in a series of rapidly diminishing, 
broad, sub(iuadrate, plumbeous, crescentic blotches close together, of 
which four may be counted to above insertion of hind legs, continued 
as broad stripe ahnost halfway along the side of tail. This is more 
evident in females than males. 

The HolbrooMa a^nis is defined as follows : 

This species differs from S. iexana in several points, chief among 
theoi the larger size of the dorsal scales and the greater length of limbs. 
Those in H. texana are scarcely larger on the back than on the sides; 
and the arrangement into oblique series can hardly be observed. There 
are about one hundred and seventy-five of the scales from head to above 
anus. In IT. affinis there are one hundred and fifty scales in the same 
distance; larger and more regularly rhomboidal. The free portion of 
tlie hind toe in texana is only about li the length of the head above 
from snout to end of occiput, and equal to the length from snout to end 
of jaws or of large lateral plates on the cheeks. In H, affinis this is 
one and one-half times the length of head and one and one-fourth or 
one and one third times length of side of jaw. The scales on the upper 
face of the thigh appear more abruptly sumller than the anterior ones 
in texana than in affinis. 

There aj^pears to be little difference in coloration. The bands beneath 
the tail appear more distinct in H. texana, more tinged with the blue of 
sides and chin deeper. The crescents on the sides are farther back in 
JI. affimis; the posteriors are separated from the groin only by its own 
width, instead of twice this amount. The edge of the anterior crescent 
in texana. reaches about two-fifths from fore to hind leg, instead oXouly 
about one-third, as in affinis. H, texana exhibits no trace of a third cres- 
cent springing from the groin. It, however, has a conspicuous black 
spot on the shoulder, with one or two behind it on the anterior face of 
humerus, very indistinctly seen in specimens of H. affinis.

It is, however, evident that there is really but one species, as many 
specimens are so strictly intermediate as to render it very difficult to 
say where they should be assigned. In the largest individuals, however, 
the average of characters as assigned is generally preserved. 

This lizard is the characteristically abundant form of western Texas. 
I found it in the iirst plateau country to the heads of the Medina and 
Upper Llano. Mr. Boll states that it does not range east of Fort 
Worth, in northern Texas. I did not observe it in the low country of 
Washington County, It evidently belongs to the plateau fauna. It 
runs with great rapidity, with its tail generally curved upward, dis- 
playing the black spots on the lower side. It prefers rocky ground, 
and does not ascend trees under ordinary circumstances. 

Holbroolda texana ranges over part of the Sonoran subregion at 
least. I have taken it at Lake Valley, New Mexico, and E. Wilkinson 
at the city of Chihuahua. The western limit of its range has not been 
determined.

Scales on back very small. Not appreciably larger than those on 

sides. Head flattened; plane from middle of orbit to snout, narrow; 

longer than broad. Ilind foot two-fifths the head and body; free 

part of largest toe considerably longer than cephalic plates. Temporal 

plates large, few in number; fully equal to those margining under 

labials behind. Upper labials seven. 

Above olive or ashy gray or green, with dorsal blotches, color gener- 
ally similar to those of H. macidata, but the lateral spots (in anterior 
half of sides) are more elongated vertically, and extend into the gray 
of the sides. They are scarcely visible from below. 

Holbroolda propimiua is easily distinguished from other species of the 
genus. The tail is slender, cylindric, and longer than the head and 
body; the hind foot is elongate, being two-fifths the length of the head

and body. Ten or more supraorbital scuta ; plates of muzzle flat; labials 
exceedingly narrow, live in number, followed by a flat one. Femoral 
pores 16-18. A pair of blue spots on the side; none under the tail. 

This species, in addition to the general characters of the type H. 
maculata, diflers in the excessive minuteness of the dorsal scales, which 
can scarcely be counted, even with a good lens. The head is more 
elongated and quite plane from above the end of the eye, instead of 
slightly convex. Its width reaches only from the end of snout to mid- 
dle of occipital, instead of behind it. There are seven oblique upper 
labials instead of six. The legs are all much longer; thus the hind 
foot is decidedly more than two-fifths the head and body instead of 
only one third or even less (two-sevenths). The free portion of hind

toe reaches far behind the occipital plate from snout, instead of only to 
about its middle. The plates on lower jaw margining the under labials 
are smaller, those on the temples fewer and larger, the two series being 
about equal; in H. maculata the case is reversed, and the upper plates 
are smaller and more numerous. 

The coloration is much the same. The indigo-black patches on the 
sides, however, are much more lengthened, forming short, oblique cres- 
cents, running up into the gray of the sides, the convexity anterior. 
They are about four times as long as wide, instead of mere oval blotches. 
There is very frequently a third, more posterior and less distinct, one. 
The female has quite a decided light stripe between the fore and hind 
legs, the lateral bars more vertical, shorter, and less distinct.

The posterior edge of the hinder blotch is just liulf way between the 
fore and hind leys. 

Specimens from the lower Eio Grande differ from the types from near 
Indianola in lighter colors, less conspicuous mottling on chin, and still 
flatter and more depressed head. Tiie cephalic plates are more flat- 
tened and less pyramidal; the tail longer. 

I did not observe the H. propinqua in any part of Texas visited by 
myself. Mr. Marnock finds it abundant near Helotes, and I'rofessor 
Baird's types came from south of San Antonio. It is doubtless a 
southwestern species.

Scales on back rather large, wider for 6 or 8 scales, then more later- 
ally; about 125 from head to anus; head broad, very short and convex; 
the lateral profile of upper part gently or rapidly convex to the mouth. 
Upper labials six; temporal plates smaller than those on the side of 
chin. Hind toe about one-third the head and body; free portion of its 
longest toe equal to length of cephalic plates. 

Above olive or ashy gray or green with sometimes a dorsal series of sub- 
([uadrate dark blotches into lighter areola. Beneath white, the tail 
beneath without bands. A whitish stripe from eye along the sides 
below the dorsal blotches. A second less distinct from mouth in line 
with lower edge of colored sides. Both sometimes broken up into small 
spots also seem more or less thickly on sides and above. Two oval 
indigo-black spots in anterior half of each side scarcely visible from 
below. 

There are four subspecies of this species, which difter as follows: 

I. Snout more pointed; anterior supralabials narrower; muzzle plates smaller. 
Under surface of tail black spotted ; no black spots on sides ; dorsal spots large, 

transverse, yellow bordered, digitate posteriorly If. m. lacerata. 

Spots absent or rarely present on inferior side of tail; two small ones on each 
side; dorsal spots small H. m. maculata. 



292 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



II. Snout shorter; anterior supralabials broad, prominent; muzzle plates larger. 
Dorsal spots distinct, back not yellow speckled; lateral spots posterior and 

inferi(tr H. m. approximana. 

Dorsal spots obscure or wanting, back yellow speckled U. m. fJarilenta, 

These subspecies have definite geographical ranges. The H. m. 
?rtcera/rt belongs to central Texas; the H. m. mac u lata to the central 
district generally and northern Texas. H. m. apjn'ojcimans is the Sono- 
ran representative; while H. m. flavilenta is found in western New 
Mexico and Arizona, excepting the desert region of the extreme south, 
according to Stejneger.'

roimdod 1 )y minute tubercles ; scales of muzzle tubercular. Labials less 
elongate, five oblique, one Hat; femoral pores lii-13; no blue spots on the 
sides; transverse blue spots on the inferior side of the tail. Color light 
brown, with six pairs of transverse dark-brown bars between the scapu- 
lar region and groin, which extend downward and backward on the 
abdomen. Their posterior border is serrate oi- digitate, and edged with 
yellowish, producing a variegated pattern. The inner part of the spots 
is frequently cut entirely off. The spots are continned on the ui)per 
side of the tail, and there are six irregular longitudinal brown bars on 
the neck. A brown band across supraorbital regions, and spot on upi)er 
surface of muzzle. Limbs brown cross-banded. A pale band on infe- 
rior part of side, which is crossed by the ends of the lateral spots. 
Below this are five or six small dark spots, sometimes obsolete. Total 
length, 99 mm.; to collar, 15 mm.; to vent, 56 mm. This is a short- 
legged species allied to the H. maculata, but with longer tail and very 
different coloration. As compared with the variety of H. maculata, 
above described, the labial scuta are shorter and less oblique, resem- 
bling more nearly those of H. te.vana. In coloration it differs from the 
H. maculata in a point not above mentioned. The dorsal ground color 
is everywhere the same, a rich yellowish brown. In the H. maculata 
the median dorsal region is paler, and the sides of the back are of a 
dark shade, which connects the spots as by a wide band. 

The most northern locality for the IIolbrooMa lacerata with which I 
am acquainted is in Erath County, west of the Upper Brazos. Mr. Boll 
found it rather abundantly there and in Comanche County. Southward 
it has been found by Mr. Marnock on the Guadalupe Eiver in Kendall 
or Comal County. It thus belongs to the first plateau fauna, and is not 
widely distributed. 

The specimens above mentioned do not exhibit lateral spots, but they 
are present on the following specimens, which have been received by 
the Smithsonian Institution :

HOLBROOKIA MACULATA MACULATA Girard. 

In this subspecies the body is moderately stout and depressed; 
much more so in the females. The head is broad and short, as wide as 
long, pointed anteriorly to the broad and rounded muzzle. The lateral 
outline of the head is very convex posteriorly, then slopes from the 
middle to the head nearly in a straight line to the line of the mouth.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



The bead above is covered by small polyhedral or i)yramidal plates, 
except oil the supraorbital region. The occipital plate is large and 
polygonal, the edges are raised, and it has also a central tubercle; it 
is situated in the midst of small plates, of which there are two series 
to the supraorbitals. There are two small vertical plates in line, but 
anterior to these there is no regular arrangement, the most symmetrical 
specimen showing one plate in the center of a circle of seven others, 
and then four median in line to rostral. There are, however, three 
series of hexagonal plates above the eye parallel to the inner border of 
small plates; anterior to which the plates on the supraorbital region 
are smaller than elsewhere on the upper surface of head. The eyelids 
are granular, with a series of longer flat plates along the edge. The

loral and supralabials are small and tubercular. The nostrils are supe- 
rior, situated in a single plate, except anteriorly, but closely surrounded 
by others which appear to form their outer border. 

The scales of the back and sides are all excessively small, almost 
granular. Those on the central line of the back for six or eight scales 
being rather larger (by an insensible gradation) than the others, and 
are quite distinctly but obtusely carinated ; the lateral scales around the 
base of the tail are all similar to the dorsal. The scales immediately back 
of the head are smaller than elsewhere on the back. About one hundred 
and twenty-five scales can be counted, as nearly as may be, from head to 
above arms. The belly scales are rhomboidal, decidedly larger than any 
of the dorsal; they are rhomboidal and smooth. Those in front of arms 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 295 

are largest. The plates on the side of the chiu (one row anteriorly, three 
behind), margining the lower labials are hexagonal, paved, and much 
larger thau the intervening ones, as are also those on the temples. 
There are two transverse folds on the throat, the covered portions of 
which are lined with smaller scales, the narrow space between the two 
being covered with large rhomboidal scales like those on the breast. 
The scales between the fore legs are perhaps larger than those on the 
belly ; those covering the shoulder considerably so. All the scales on the 
body are arranged in quincunx, except on the belly and beneath the 
tail, where they are in transverse series of small, nearly square, alter- 
nating plates. The scales on the under and inner surface of the hind 
leg are larger than elsewhere, especially on the tibia. Those on the 
shoulder and inside of forearm are also large. The male has two plates 
behind the arms not seen in the female. The femoral pores are distinct. 

In the alcoholic specimen the upper parts are ashy gray. On 
each side the back is a series of U-shaped blotches, the convexity 
posterior; sometimes angular or emarginate behind; some 8 or 10 
pairs from head to above anus. Those blotches anteriorly are some- 
what obsolete or not filled up; they are bordered behind (sometimes all 
round) by a light yellowish suffusion or spotting, lighter than the 
ground color. In some specimens there is a narrow, horizontal, light 
line from the orbital region above the arms and below the edge of the 
dorsal blotches fading out on the sides. This sometimes forms the 
dividing line between another lateral series of blotches corresponding 
with the dorsal; this series is, however, generally obsolete or else 
broken up with obscure mottling, the posterior boixler of light suffu- 
sion or spottings indicating the position of the blotches. The sides 
occasionally show minute points of whitish. The dorsal blotches are 
continued in two series on the thickened portion of the tail; the atten- 
uated portion, however, is usually i)lain gray. The under i^arts are 
yellowish white. The Jaws with transverse bars of plain bluish, con- 
tinued obliquely backward on the under surface of the head, which is 
variously mottled with the same. On each side below and adjacent to 
the outer edge of the belly are two very distinct indigo-black blotches 
with a suffusion of bluish around them. These are rather elongated 
transversely, placed one in advance of the other, and both situated in 
the posterior extremity of the anterior half of the region from fore to 
hind legs. They do not extend up the side as far as the lower lateral 
dusiy blotches. 

In some specimens there is a decided indication of a second light 
stripe on the side of the neck, continuous with the light edge of the 
upper jaw and extending, with several interruptions, to the arm. 
The upper surface of the limbs is transversely banded with dusky. 
The posterior surface of the thigh is without conspicuous marking. 

The female differs very little, if at all, in color, although possibly the 
markings above are more obsolete. 



296 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



There is sometimes, but very rarely, a third spot on the sides behind 
the others; as also a trace of a light yellowish line on the flanks, 
extending between the legs. 

The hind feet are short, being barely more than one-third tlie dis- 
tance from snout to arm, the free portion of longest toe not reaching 
from snout to end of large occipital. 

Specimens from western Texas are larger and much sprinkled, some- 
times all over, with small rounded white spots, the dark blotches even 
being at times entirely wanting. The ground color in these, as from all 
localities, varies from dark to light ashy, with sometimes even a tinge 
of reddish brown. Some of these more Southern and Western speci- 
mens (Oat. jSTos. 2813, 2771, etc.) seem to have the upper labial and radial 
plates projecting more horizontally all round, so as to form a kind of rim 
or shelf. In fact, it is quite possible that Cat. No. 2813 may belong to a 
species different from any here described. Compared with types from 
the Platte, the plates of the head above are larger, those on the anterior 
portion of the supraorbital space being nearly equal to those between 
the orbits, instead of conspicuously smaller. The head is narrower, 
more pointed, and less convex; the scales on the cheek and inside of 
the thighs larger and more equal ; the legs and tail longer. If not 
distinct, this may at any rate be considered as a variety. 

I did not observe this species in the parts of Texas I examined, but 
a variety of it with a longer tail than the usual form was obtained from 
Mr. Boll, who probably took it near Dallas. Its characters are: Tail 
slender, cylindric, a little longer than body; hind foot less than one- 
third head and body. Eight or ten supraorbital scuta; scales of muzzle 
tubercular; labials very narrow, five; femoral pores thirteen. A pair 
of blue spots on the side; none under the tail. West of Dallas, Messrs. 
Boll and Isaac obtained this species from Weatherford to Fort Concho, 
and Mr. Isaac sent it from the Wichita country. Professor Baird 
records it as found between San Antonio and El Paso.

HOLBROOKIA MACULATA APPROXIMANS Baird. 

Holhroohi maculata approximans Baiiid, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1858, p. 
253.— BOCOURT, Miss. Sci. Mex., 1874, p. 163. 

Body squat, depressed. Tail shorter than body. General form of 
H. maculata. Head swollen, as broad as long; i^rofile very convex. 
Upper labials, six. Large plates on temples, smaller than those mar- 
gining lower labials behind, the labials thickening. Scales rather 
large; about one hundred and thirty from head to above anus; largest 
in middle of back. Femoral pores about thirteen. 

Above ashy brown. Back with ten dorsal (and sometimes an obscure 
lateral) series of nearly equidistant angulated blotches, seven to ten 
from head to above anus, and continued above the tail, the lower 
surface of which is plain. Sides and sometimes fore part of back 
rather thickly crowded with whitish spots. No indications of light lines 
on sides of neck and back. Beneath whitish; the sides of the belly 
with a light blue patch, in which are situated ten transversely elon- 
gated indigo-black blotches, which do not extend into the dark part of 
the sides and are entirely visible from below. The middle line of the 
sides falls between the ten blotches. Faint traces of a third more pos- 
terior are occasionally visible. Female with the indigo blotches and 
blue patches less prominent. 

This subspecies is most similar to H. m. maculata, but is considerably 
larger and has the head wider, still more convex. The scales are rather 
larger. The feet are of about the same proportional length. The spots 
on the back are quite distinct, with a light areola. Behind they are 
irregularly U - or W-shaped. There is a decided indication in most speci-

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



mens of a second lateral series on each side. There is no indication of 
the ten lateral light stripes on the side, nor of the pale stripe along the 
back separating the dorsal blotches. The sides and back are more 
regularly spotted with whitish. The jaws are banded transversely 
with bluish, which passes obliquely backward on the chin. 

The most striking differences from its allies seen is the much more 
backward position of the two indigo-blue blotches and their inferior 
situation on the sides and in the whitish of the belly, and not on the 
sides of the body, partly in the brownish. They are also completely 
enveloped in the blue patch instead of having only an occasional slight 
suffusion of the same. They are almost entirely, instead of very 
slightly, visible from below.

Lake Valley, New Mexico. 

Collection of E. D. Cope. 

This subspecies differs from the typical form in having larger preuasal 
scales separated l)y only two flat scales in front, instead of four tuber- 
cular ones, and in having only four flat scales between the nostrils 
above, instead of six tubercular ones, and in having the scales of the 
front flatter. The spots are obscure or entirely wanting; when present 
they are more numerous than in the var. maculata, there being eight 
between axilla and groin, instead of six. The sides and dorsal lateral 
regions are thickly marked with small yellow spots. 

This form was established on two specimens from Lake Valley, in 
southern New Mexico. Dr. Stejneger has since recorded it from south- 
ern and western Arizona.

A large interparietal, and the plates on rostrum and above orbits 
large and rather regular. Scales on sides small, granular; those on 
back imbricated, angular. Digits pectinate below. Femoral pores. 
Tail long. Ears distinct. A well-marked gular fold of large scales. 
Sides of neck folded; upper labials square; plane externally, not im- 
bricate. A long infraorbital; nostrils lateral, subterminal. Tongue 
scarcely emarginate; lip slightly free with distinct pallets beneath. 
No palatines. Posterior teeth only tricuspid. 

The i^recediug diagnosis is intended to define a well-marked group of 
diminutive North American Saurians, which would be taken for Scelo- 
porus but for their very small dorsal scales and the sharp constriction, 
or fold, on the lower throat with a band of scales larger than those 
anterior or posterior to it. The i)lates on the head are nearly as regular 
as in Sceloporus. It is easily known, by the presence of external ears, 
from Holbroolia, which has a similar fold on the throat, and which has 
also the lateral folds of neck and body less distinct, or almost wanting. 

There are three well-marked sections in this group; one with the 
dorsal scales very small, and only gradually larger than those on the 
sides, and another with four to six central series of very large cari- 
nated scales, those on either side abruptly smaller and tuberculate. 
The tyjDe species, U. stansburiana, belongs to the first; U. ornata to 
the second division. Dr. Hallowell has proposed a genus Urosaurus 
for the latter division based on a second sj)ecies, U. graciosus. The 
gradation from this species, however, to the TJ. stanshuriana through 
U. schottii and ornata is so very gentle that it is very difficult to draw 
the line. In all external characters there is little difterence between 
U. stanshuriana and ornata, except in the character of the dorsal scales, 
the proportions of tail and body and other features being almost pre- 
cisely the same. U. ornata and graciosa, on the other hand, agree per- 
fectly in the character of the dorsal scales, and yet differ widely in 
proportions and shape of head, body, and tail. 

The species of Uta differ as follows : 

A. Dorsal scales small, smootb, nearly uniform in size. Caudal scales small, smootb, 
not spinous. Collar not denticulate. Tail depressed; no blue on 
belly. (Large species.) 
Median dorsal scales a little larger tban lateral dorsals; body stout, depressed; 

green, witb tliree dorsal black crossbars V. thalassina Cope. 

Similar to U. thalansina, but "witb bind limb much sborter, snout shorter and 
more truncate, and four black transverse dorsal bars."

The geuus Uta belongs to the Nearctic Fauna, only two species 
{U. hicarinata and F. auriculata) extending beyond its limits. In the 
Nearctic Fauna it is nearly restricted to the Sonorau district. It does 
not occur in the Eastern nor Austroriparian, and one species only 
ranges from the Sonoran into the Pacific ( U. stanshuriana). One 
species is confined to the St. Lucas region ( U. thalassina), and another 
i-auges from that center to the Pacific ( U. nigricauda). From the 
iSonoran two species range into the Great Basin, U. stanshuriana and 
U. graciosa, the former of them extending- far northward. One species, 
V. mearnsiiy is found near the south border of California, while two 
others belong to different jjarts of the peninsula of Lower California 
{U. repens and V. parviscutata). The f7. attricwZato is from the Revilla- 
gigedo Islands, a region Avhose faunal relation is doubtful, but is prob- 
ably with the iSTeotropical Realm.

Form much depressed. Median dorsal scales larger, smooth, gradu- 
ating into the lateral, smaller than those of the abdomen, not sepa- 
rated by median smaller ones. Abdominal scales nearly rectangular, 
in transverse series. Brachial scales a little larger, more imbricate,

less than twice the length of the head and body. Total length, 533 mm. ; 
tail, 450 mm. ; body, 135 mm. ; from collar to end of muzzle, 56 mm. 

Color above sea green; a narrow black cross band separates the 
nuchal from the dorsal region; a broader black band, which presents a 
convexity anteriorly, crosses the latter anterior to its middle. Between 
these some indistinct undulatory bands, three similar on the posterior 
dorsal region, followed by numerous caudal annuli, which become very 
broad. Beneath, bluish green, darkest on the gular region; tail and

regarded by Boulenger as the type of a distinct genus, on account of 
the smaller pholidosis of the tail. The XT. mearnsii furnishes such a 
complete transition to the other forms of the genus that this course 
does not seem to be necessary.

This species is evidently quite near to the IJ. thalassina. I only- 
know it from the description above cited, which I quote below : 

The head is broad, short, and depressed. The snout is short and truncate. The 
nostrils are large, superior, and much nearer to the end of the snout than to the 
orbit. The ear opening is large, and has an anterior denticulation of three pointed 
scales. The head scales are smooth and slightly convex anteriorly. The rostral is

very broad and low, with a median superior projection. The frontal is transversely 
divided. The largest supraoculars are separated from the frontals, frontoparietals, 
and parietals by two scries of small plates. The interparietal is very large. There 
are five superior and seven inferior labials to below the middle of the eye. There 
are several series of enlarged sublabials. The gular region is covered with small 
grannies, which are slightly largest centrally. There is a weak anterior gular fold, 
followed by a strong posterior fold. The latter is covered with small subgrannlar 
plates, the largest of which, on its edge, are about equal in size to the first scales 
on th(> chest. The back and sides are covered with round granules, which are larger 
medially than laterally. The tail is somewhat depressed and expaiuled at its base, 
and is covered with whorls of small weakly keeled scales. The scales on the

anterior surfaces of the limbs are large and weakly keeled. The ventral plates are 
larger than the caudals. The color above is dull grayish olive, with four distinct 
anterior and three fainter posterior transverse black bands. The tail is similarly 
barred with dusky. The throat is brownish, marked with blackish centrally. The 
chest and abdomen are white, clouded with slate.

Stejueger's description of this well-marked species is so full that I 
quote it at length : 

Description of the type. — Female. Head moderately depressed, snout narrow ; can- 
thns rostralia well marked; nostrils rather large, almost superior, much nearer to 
the tip of the snout than to the orbit; ear opening large, with four very long, tri- 
angular, pointed scales and three smaller ones in front; head shields smooth; frontal 
divided transversely; about eight of the posterior supraorbital scales enlarged, one 
being ijarticularly large, these separated from the froiitals by a single series of 
granules; superciliaries, particularly the anterior ones, very long and narrow; a 
very long and narrow infraorbital; occipital as large as ear opening; supralabials 
six, and, like rostral, very wide and low; infralabials scarcely higher, hut consider- 
ably narrower; scales on throat small, rounded, smooth, those on the middle and 
near the edge of the gular fold somewhat larger; only one transverse gular folfl, 
not denticulated; sides of neck strongly folded; scales on back and sides rather 
large, rounded and convex granules, those on lower surface of body larger, flat, 
hexagonal; limbs with enlarged, keeled scales, and rather long, the anterior when 
pressed to the side reaching to the insertion of the thigh, the posterior when 
stretched forward reaching to the orbit; twenty femoral pores on each side; tail 
depressed at base, slender, its length more than one and three-fourths that of head 
and body, covered with rings of rather large scales which, on the upper surface and 
the sides, are jjrovided with a very strong keel ending in a projecting spine. 

Color above olive, more brownish on head and tail, with irregular dusky, nearly 
blackish, cross bands; lighter spots, or marblings, on the interspaces; a very dis- 
tinctly marked, straight, and intensely black band from shoulder to shoulder across 
the back; limbs irregularly cross-banded with dusky; basal two-thirds of tail pale 
brownish olive with wide black crossbars, terminal third uniformly blackish ; under 
surface greenish white, bluish on flanks, with lighter dots ; chin and throat with a 
network of bluish gray. 

Diniensiona. — Total length, 229 mm. ; head and body, 79 mm. ; tail, 150 mm. ; fore 
limb, 37 mm. ; hind limb, 61 mm. 

Variation. — In addition to the type, Dr. Mearns's collection contains sis other 
specimens, which fully establish the characters of the species. The individual varia- 
tion is comparatively slight, and but few deviations from the above description of 
the type are noticed. In some specimens there seems to Ite a slight anterior gular 
fold, but it is not marked by any difference in the scutellatiou. In one specimen the 
frontal is not divided transversely, but in about one-half the large supraoculars are 
separated from the frontal by a double row of grannies. Other discrepancies will be 
noticed in the list of si»ecimens given below. 

The males have enlarged postanal scales. 

The individual dirterences of coloration consist mainly in the outline and intensity 
of the dusky crossbars, while the black collar is equally distinct in all. 

The sexes are alike in color, except that the blue flank patch is somewhat darker 
and wider in tlie males. 

Compariaon with Uta ihalasai)) a.— Although closely allied to Uta thalassina, 
described in 1863 by Professor Cope from specimens collected at Cape St. Lucas, the 
))re8ent species differs in many essential points, most of which have been indicated 
in the diagnosis. 

In addition to these it may l)c remarked that the granules on the back are larger 
in rta meanisii, but that the ventral scales are smaller; it lacks the well-defined 
anterior gular fold of U, thalassina; the legs and tail are comparatively longer, and 
the femoral pores are more numerous; each of the latter, moreover, is bordered 
behind by two granules, while in I', thalassina there are three. The last-mentioned 
species appears also to be nuich the larger, as the specimens collected by Dr. Mearns 
seem to be quite adult. 

The most striking diflference, however, are the long preauricular spines and the

largo, strongly kcelod and spinous caudal scales of Ula mearnsi, together with the 
absence of the two posterior dorsal hlack hands so characteristic of U. thalassina.' 

Geographical distribution. — Dr. Mearns found this species "extremely plentiful" 
among the rocks on the eastern slope of the Coast Range of California, near the Mexi- 
can boundary line, from the lowest water in the canyon at the base to the summit. So 
far this is the only locality where it is known to have been taken. I would suggest, 
however, that it was most probably this species which Mr. Lockington has recorded 
from Ensenada, Todos Santos Bay, LoAver California, 75 miles southeast of San 
Diego' as Uta ihalasstna.

In describing this species Dr. Stejueger remarks: 

The accidental nature of reptile collecting is well illustrated by the discovery of 
this very con.spiciious and distinct species in a region which has been visited before 
by some of our best collectors. 

The trenchant character of the distinctions between the present species and its 
nearest ally inhabiting the Cape St. Lucas region emphasizes the gap between the 
Cape region proper and the rest of the Lower California peninsula. 

This discovery, moreover, is quite imjiortant, inasmuch as it bridges over the 
supposed difference between Vta thalassina and the other species of the genus Uta. 
Boulenger, in 1885, established the genus Petrosanrits for that species because of its 
small caudal scales, the smoothness of the dorsal granules, and the absence of den- 
ticulation on the border of the i>osterior gular fold. The present species, however, 
has the caudal scales large, keeled, and spinose, in fact, exactly as in the typical 
species of the genus Uta; the dorsal scales are larger, more convex, nearly tuber- 
cular on the sides, thus approaching the other Utas, while the question of denticu- 
lation to the collar is one essentially of degree only. However, the species which I 
am dedicating to its discoverer. Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. A., naturalist of the Inter- 
national Boundary Commission (United States and Mexico), is undoubtedly nearly 
related to U. thalassina and more so than to any of the other species of the genus.

Above (lark green, with two dorsal series of cresceiitic dusky blotches, 
bordered by light blue dots, the blotches sometimes obscure and the 
blue dots irregularly scattered and mixed with black ones. Two light 
stripes on each side the neck and body, sometimes broken up into 
rounded spots, the lower especially where they are often elongated, 
forming transverse bars. The interspace of these are light lines, some- 
times plain dusky, sometimes spotted with black and light blue.

with small scales, but easily distinguished at the first glance by a well-

marked gular fold. This is very closely pressed to the subjacent skin, 
the internal surface lined with very small scales. On the edge of the 
fold a single series of about fourteen scales considerably larger than those 
immediately before them or on those on the breast, about equal. There 
arc slight indications of one or two constrictions anterior to the first, 
but they do not form regular folds, and there is no marked difference 
in the size of the scales. There is also a lateral fold or cavity on each 
side of the neck, lined with smaller scales, as in Sceloporus, but less dis- 
tinct. The dorsal scales are tubercular or granular, subliexagonal, 
becoming gradually smaller on the sides; abruptly much smaller in the 
groin. They are without spines above, and barely imbricated. On the 
sides they are plain tubercular and almost paved. They are arranged 
in rather oblique series. The belly scales are flat, subrhomboidal; in 



308 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

nearly trausverse but slightly oblique series, and considerably larger 
than those on the back. The scales on the tail are verticillate, strongly 
carinated except below, and abruptly much larger than those on the 
rump or back. The scales on the thigh are about equal except on the ' 
posterior surface, where they become abruptly smaller. They diminish 
very gradually below from the anterior edge to the femoral pores. All 
the scales on the legs are strongly carinate, except on the inferior sur- 
faces. There are fifteen femoral pores. 

The plates of the head are quite regularly arranged and large, some- 
what as in Sceloporus. There is a large occipital encircled laterally and 
behind by one or two series of plates which are larger than those on 
the nape. It is separated an tero- laterally from the supraorbital region 
by two plates on each side, the anterior in contact or separated by a very 
small median one. These are in contact with a single interorbital ver- 
tical, followed by another. 

The arrangement beginning with the verticils is I, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, and 
4 internasals. The third set of 3 sometimes has the median divided 
transversely, and there is usually an additional very small exterior 
plate. The nostrils are superior, large, and rounded ; in one plate with 
narrow margin and surrounded, except externally, by small ones. All 
these plates are somewhat depressed, pyramidal, or raised in the 
middle, sometimes conspicuously so, but they are not wrinkled. The 
sui)raorbital region shows an inner series of small plates, then a series 
of large transverse smooth plates with a smaller one in its concavity; 
exterior to these are two series of very small plates and the anterior 
extremity of the supraorbits is filled with a confused mixture of the 
same. The loral region is filled with three or four large angular plates; 
the upper labials are five or six, long and narrow, not conspicuously 
imbricated, and rounded externally; they are bordered above by one 
series of plates, above which is a second shorter one. The lower labials 
are very similar to the upper, and bordered internally behind by three 
rows of plates mucii larger than those on the chin, the innermost alone 
running forward to the mental plate, and much larger than the rest. 
The remaining plates on the chin are rounded and larger than those on 
the back. The cheeks are covered with tubercles as large as the dor- 
sal scales; there are six or seven much larger behind, where they are 
separated by a few small ones from the ear. This is small, rounded, 
and i)artly covered by a series of two or three long-pointed triangular 
scales on the anterior border. The limbs are short and stout; the hind 
foot about one-third the head and body, the claws very short and blunt. 
Tlie tail is rather longer than the body, tapering gently throughout; 
depressed to near the end, which is cylindrical and much attenuated. 

The general color above and on the sides is a dark, greenish-olive, 
varied with small blue spots on single scales, and with larger black 
dots interspersed more sparsely. There is in reality a serial arrange- 
ment of two rows of U-shaped dark blotches on the back, punctate

laterally and heliiiid with blue. A faint light greenish line from the 
eye and another from the angle of the mouth embrace between them 
on the sides a dark stripe, quite continuous in some specimens and 
darker than the ground color; they are sometimes very distinct on the 
tail. The under parts are greenish- white; sometimes strongly greenish, 
varied with paler, and with a brassy luster. The jaws are banded 
transversly with blue and yellowish, extending obliquely backward on 
each side of the chin. In the male is a distinct rounded black spot, 
encircled by a yellowish border, situated in the olive of either side and 
in the posterior portion of the anterior third of the space between fore 
and hind legs. This is less distinct in the female. The legs are banded 
above. The under surface of tail is without markings. 

In some specimens there is a tendency to a second large black spot 
on each side of the neck, "* 

In nearly all the more Western specimens of this species, as in Cat. Ko. 
4122 from the Colorado River, there are certain differences from the types 
Cat. No. 2753, Thus the dorsal scales become gradually larger from the 
head along the rump to the tail, instead of having the rump scales like 
those of the back, and both abruptly smaller than those on the tail. 
Along the middle of the back the scales are all carinated, showing about 
20 longitudinal ridges. Over this space the scales become gradually 
smaller from the central line, then on the sides they change quite 
abruptly to smaller, more tubercular, and ecarinate ones, smaller in the 
groin and above the arm. There are twelve or fourteen ridges on the 
rump between the hind legs, instead of sixteen or twentj^ in U. stans- 
huriana. The scales on the lower part of back and rump are quite as 
large and even larger than those on the belly, not smaller. 

The colors are quite similar; the upper part dark green, spotted with 
lighter. Few dorsal series of blotches. The under parts are blue iu 
very old specimens; the chin darker; the lateral black spot very 
conspicuous. 

The sides are frequently quite uniformly dark green, with a series of 
light vertical bars behind the lateral black spot. In Cat. No. 2753 there 
are two black bars across the nape. In this variety there is an evident 
ap])roach to the peculiar characters of Uta ornata. 

This species is abundant in the entire region between the Rocky 
Mountains and the Sierra Nevada, I have taken it as far north as 
Summer Lake in central Oregon, north of which I have no record of 
its existence. It inhabits rocky places, especially the basaltic cliff's so 
common in the Great Basin, and delights in the hot sun. It is very 
active in its movements. 

Dr, Merriam, in his report on the results of the Death Valley Expe- 
dition, makes the following remarks concerning the distribution- of this 
species : 

This tiny brown-shouldered lizard is common over nearly the whole of the desert 
region traversed by the expedition from California to Utah and Arizona, and occurs 
also on the west slope of the Sierra Nevada, as the subjoined list of localities shows.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



Whether the form inhabiting the upper San Joaquin Valley is identical with that 
from the tleserts remains to be seen. 

Uta stansbitriana is common throughout the Mohave Desert, ranging westward to 
the extreme west end of Antelope Valley and down through the Canada de las Uvas 
to old Fort Tejon. It ranges also over Wallcer Pass and down into Kern Valley. It 
is common in Owens Valley and thence easterly in the Coso Mountains, Panamint 
Valley and Mountains, Death Valley, the Amargosa Deseit, Ash Meadows, Pahrump 
and Vegas valleys, and at the Great Bend of the Colorado, whence it ranges north- 
erly in the valleys of the Virgin and Muddy to the Santa Clara Valley in south- 
western Utah,, and the Pahranagat Valley, Nevada. In western Nevada it was not 
found north of Sarcobatus Flat.

Similar to typical U. stansburiana and with the, same dorsal lepidosis, the scales 
being small, tuberciilato, and not carinatod for their entire length, but much larger 
and with longer fore legs, the tips of which when adpressed reach to or beyond the 
insertion of the thigh; scales on edge of collar much smaller; large prefrontals, 
about twice as large as the largest supraoculars; number of femoral pores about 17; 
about thirty dorsals in a head length ; color (in alcohol) above, uniform bluish drab, 
with numerous small whitish dots, two to three scales large, sprinkled over the bcTdy^ 
and no dusky markings whatever ; dark-blue blotch behind axilla present, though 
rather indistinct.

enlarged scales, or tubercles, those on the dorsolateral fold being- 
scarcely perceptibly larger than the other dorsal granules; nor are 
there any pointed tubercles or clusters of tubercles on the neck. In 
addition to these characters the carinatiou of the enlarged dorsals is 
rather feeble. As in typical U. ornata, the hind legs are short and the

Cat. No. 2760, U.S.N.M. 

This species has much the same form and general characters of U. 
stansburiana,the principal ditiereiice being in the character of the dorsal 
scale. These in the type are all very minute, but carinated, diminish- 
ing gently toward the sides. In U. ornata there is a dorsal series of 
three or four very large carinated scales, beginning near the head and 
running to the tail for an average width of half the head. These are 
not very regular, varying much in size at different points, sometimes 
with small ones inteicalated. On either side of this the scales are 
abruptly very small and granular, becoming smaller to the lower part 
of the sides, where they are much as in stanshuriana. The folds of 
skin on the neck and back generally have a series of larger scales 



316 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

along their sumiuit, esi)ecially oji the dorsal fokls, distant about the 
width of the head, where the larger scales occur at intervals. The 
scales on the tibial joint are larger and more angulated than in the 
other. The hind feet are short, not one- third the head and body; the 
hind feet are shorter, the fingers considerably longer than in stanshu- 
riana. The head is broad; the width equal to the distance from snout 
to middle of occipital, the free portion of long hind toe a little less. 

The tail is a little longer than the body, or possibly longer, as it has 
been renewed ; depressed or trigonal at base, then cylindrical or even 
a little compressed. The femoral pores are about eleven in number. 

The scales on the chin are quite small and rounded or paved, 
decidedly smaller than the imbricated rhomboidal scales of the space 
between the gular folds. 

The folds of skin, where they can be made out, apj^ear to run in 
the following manner: The longest starts in a line with the edge of the 
head above and a short distance behind the head, running back to the 
upper edge of the insertion of the thigh. This is crowned at intervals 
by large scales. The second begins on the lower j^art of the sides, just 
back of the axilla, and after rising a little runs back nearly to the 
groin parallel with the upper fold. This likewise shows occasional 
larger scales. The fold crossing the throat and shoulders anteriorly 
is continued a little obliquely backward to the upper or dorsal fold. 
Anterior to this, another fold begins on either side the throat and 
extends half way round the side of the neck, where it covers the gular 
cavity seen here and in Sceloporus. Here it meets a short fold running 
downwards from the upper border of the ear (continued behind to 
the first transverse fold), and from this point of intersection there pro- 
ceed two folds across to the upper or dorsal one, united below. A sec- 
ond short fold runs from the lower edge of the ear back to the second 
transverse fold. 

This species is of a brownish gray above; each side of the back with 
a series of transverse narrow bars of black, with a light grayish areola 
and varying in shape, sometimes a meniscus, sometimes bifurcating. 
There are usually two short longitudinal stripes on the nape. From 
the shoulder usually runs a dark line perpendicularly to the back, and 
sending a short branch abruptly forward at a right angle and in line 
with the ventral stripes. The under parts are white, in the male the 
chin is greenish, and on each side the belly, nearly meeting centrally, 
is an elongated x^atch of light greenish or bluish as in Sceloporus. 

Variety linearis. — Among the specimens before me are several (as Cat. 
No. 2759), which, with the general characters of Uta ornata, have instead 
of the transverse bands a trace of four dorsal black lines, interrupted 
at irregular intervals, and thus broken up into sections from an eighth 
of an inch to an inch. One of these on either side borders the large 
scales, the other runs along the raised lateral fold. There is the usual 
blackish bar in front of the shoulder forming a kind of interrupted 
collar. There are a few light spots on the side.

A single specimeu obtained in middle Utah in 1872. In 1873 and 
1871 the species was fonnd to be quite numerous in Colorado, Arizona, 
and New Mexico, frequenting rocky places and exceedingly hard to 
catch. Color of throat, yellowish orange; of abdomen, white, ranging 
to greenish olive. The general coloration depends much upon the color 
of the rock upon which they are found.

No. 3, 1890, p. 108. 

Head broad, short, depressed. Two regular series of large dorsal 
scales on each side the back, with two others much smaller between 
them along the median line. Tail about one and a half or one and 
three-fourths times the length of head and body. 

.Vbove dark or light brownish gray. Sides with broad transverse 
bands of blackish, sometimes bifurcating above. Sides of neck with a 
more distinct and linear band. Sides of belly in male blue, spotted 
with white. 

Stejneger remarks^ that this species differs from the U. ornata in 
the greater length of its legs, as well as in scale characters. Thus 
he says in the U. ornata the hind leg is shorter than the distance 
betsveen the vent and the collar, while in the U. symmetrica this length 
is equal to or greater than that dimension. In four specimens of TTtas

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



in my private collection from Sonora the dorsal scales are precisely 
those of the U. symmetrica^ but the posterior legs are shorter thau the 
distance between the vent in collar in all of them. 

The difference in the regularity of the dorsal scales in specimens from 
Texas and Utah and California (as Cat. No. 2742) is so strongly marked 
that I am inclined to separate them as a decided variety, if not as a 
good species. The coloration is much the same. 

They have the fine set scales above smaller and more regular. The 
dorsal plates are in four pretty regular series from near head to tail,

embracing along their median line two series of smaller ones, making 
six in all. Sometimes the median small scales are in greater number. 
The plates on the cheeks and chin appear more minute. 

The head is very broad; the width reaching to the posterior extrem- 
ity of the occipital. The tail is from one and one-half to two times the 
leng,th of head and body. The coloration is very much the same; the 
ground tint above darker. 

Cat. No. 4275 from the San Francisco Metropolitan National Museum 
has the scales on the back quite uniform and regular, much as in 
U. gracoisa.

UTA SCHOTTII Baird. 
Via schottii Baird, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1858, p. 253. 

Head pointed ; narrow and nearly as high as wide. Dorsal scales in 
two regular series along either side of the median line, which is occupied 
by two or three rows of smaller ones. Tail probably twice the body. 

General color, nearly black; brownish below. Sides with broad, 
dark bands; upper parts spotted thickly with light blue, especially on 
the back. The sides of the tail with bands of the same. Sides of 
belly in male blue, with white spots; chin blue. 

In this species the head is elongated and iwinted, compressed and 
narrow, nearly or quite as deep as broad. The plates on the occiput 
on either side of the large median one are unusually large, much more 
than in Z'. ornata and tubercular. In front of the two verticals (1, 1) 
the plates are 2, 3, 3 and 4 to the two large internasals. The nostrils 
are quite oblique, though within the canthiis rostralis. There are four 
rows of supraorbital ])lates exclusive of the inner margin. The scales 
in the middle of the chest are much smaller than in its exterior. The 
lateral folds ai)pear as in ornata. The solitary i)lates in the upper lateral 
fold seem unusually large. The dorsal large scales are in two very 
regular sei-ies on either side of the median line (making four), and 
inclose an interval filled with two or three rows of ihuch smaller, 
though irregular carinated scales. The large scales appear much 
larger than in allied species. The tail is broken off, but is probably 
about twice the head and body. 

The general pattern of coloration is much as in allied species, except 
that the ground color api)ears nearly black all over. On the back, 
however, the transverse darker bars may be traced, and there exhibit 
a tendency to unite on the back. The upper parts and sides of body 



320 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

aud limbs are dotted with well-defined blue spots, most abundant along 
tbe back. There are blue bands on the sides aud blue spots on the 
back of such portion of the tail as still remains. The whole under 
surface of the head is blue; darkest on the point of the chin. The 
sides of the belly (and even the central portion) are dusky bluish, the 
blue deepest anteriorly; the whole under part with light bluish spots. 
The remaining under parts are of a dark pepper and salt mixture. 

Although not much reliance can be placed on the rostral plates as 
furnishing characters, yet in the single specimen of the present species 
there are but four in the series behind the internasals, instead of the 
five or six on the others. The occipital plates on each side the median 
one are much larger than usual. The head is elongated and narrow, 
but nearly or quite as deep a-s wide, differing in its narrowness from 
ornata and in its depth from graciosa. The dorsal scales are unusually 
large; they agree with U. symmetrica in the distinctness of the series 
on each side, inclosing smaller ones between, but are considerably 
larger. 

The colors are much darker than in others, and the light blue spots 
above and on sides of tail appear peculiar to it. 

I have been unable to find the typical specimen of this species, and 
the above description is taken from Professor Baird's manuscript. No 
other specimens have been correctly identified with it, those given in 
Yarrow's check list being the U. stansburiana.

Back with two series of large carinated scales, forming on each side 
of the vertebral line a slightly raised keel, which begins at a level 
with the shoulders and is i)rolonged on the tail. Irregular black spots, 
longer than broad, are scattered over the body, which form, on a ground 
of a greenish-yellow, a partial collar on the neck, and on the tail nar- 
row half-rings, regularly spaced. Legs and toes crossed by spots of 
the same color. 

Trunk slightly depressed; limbs feeble, especially the front ones. 
Tail rather long and robust. Head small, muzzle short, pointed, and 
flat; nostrils round, each opened in a plate of similar shape and slightly 
projecting; rostral plate triangular, a little raised, but equaling in size 
the space comprised between the external borders of the nostrils; two 
pairs of internasal scales; prefrontal region with scaly sheets, rather 
large and polygonal; frontal plate pentagonal, slightly wider in front 
than behind, in contact at the posterior edge with the two fronto- 
parietals which border the interparietal in front; this latter is quite 
wide, rather broader than long, equaling in breadth one-third the length 
of the head; it is bordered on each side by two parietals, and posteri-

orly by three very siujiU scales; supraocular scales equal in size, partic- 
ularly iu the female, four iu number, broader than long, and surrounded 
by scutella more numerous iu front than ou the other sides. The edge 
of the muzzle protected by two scales with i^rojecting keel, followed by 
two overhauging scales, slightly elongated; a long narrow scutellum 
forms almost the entire suborbital arch ; on each lip there are five or 
six pairs of plates; the npper ones are surmounted by another row of 
scales just a little smaller. Mental plate i)entagonal, as wide as it is 
high, having an acute angle behind; and followed on each of the jaws 
by rather large scutella, which gradually diminish in size as they recede. 
Auricular opening large, with the anterior border furnished with small

conical scaies, forming a feebly-toothed structure. Under the neck 
there is a granulated pavement separated from the larger and imbri- 
cated scales of the chest by the two transverse folds of the neck; the 
scales of the posterior part of this region are better developed and 
termituite in points; on the sides of the neck there are wrinkles edged 
with little tubercles, forming longitudinal ridges, originating back of 
the ear, one of which is prolonged underneath the arm. Trunk lightly 
depressed, covered above and on the sides with small scales, almost 
round, slightly convex, not imbricated, and among which the keeled 
scales show like small tubercular elevations; scales of the abdomen 
rather large, smooth, and imbricated. Tail longer than the head and

body, wborled irregularly above and regularly below, presenting every-' 
where the large scales imbricated and keeled. Limbs short, the length 
of the tibia scarcely equaling the space comprised between the end of the 
muzzle and the exterior border of the occipital plate; the front of the 
arms and thighs and the external part of tlie legs furnished with keeled 
and imbricated scales, nearly as large as those of the tail; the granu- 
lations resemble those of the flanks protecting the back of the thighs. 
The feet are covered above and below with small keeled scales. Eleven 
or twelve pores on each thigh. Male with two large glossy scales 
behind the arms. 

Measurements. — Total length of male, 140 mm. ; length of head above, 
125 mm.; length of head below, taken from chin to pectoral fold, 17 
mm.; length of head at the level of the temples, 11 mm.; length from 
pectoral fold to arms, 38 mm.; length of tail, 83 mm.; length of tibia, 
115 mm. 

General color, a greenish gray, with limbs and tail shaded with red- 
dish brown; a black stripe forming a collar passes across the neck; 
traces of the same color cross the head, back, and flanks; the limbs, 
toes, and tail equally crossed by small brown bands. Inferior regions 
tinted yellow lightly stippled with brown ; males have the entire abdom- 
inal region a bluislj gray, a mode of coloration approaching that seen 
in animals of the same sex belonging to the genus Scelojwrus. 

This species occurs throughout Mexico, as far north as the city of 
Chihuahua, where it was obtained by Mr. Edward Wilkinson.

This small species is abundant in Lower California. Van Deuburgh, 
who has seen many of them, says: 

There is a very great amount of variation iu the size, shape, and number of the 
head plates, even the frontal being sometimes divided transversely. The largest 
dorsal scales are along the median line. They are replaced, sometimes gradually 
and sometimes abruptly, by granules on the sides. Seventeen to twenty-four of the 
largest dorsals are equal to the length of the head to the posterior edge of the inter-

purietal (occipital) plate. The ventral scales are larger than the dorsals and per- 
fectly smooth. The caudals are the largest of all and are very strongly keeled and 
mncronate. The number of femoral pores varies from nine to thirteen. The color 
of the throats of the males varies from canary yellow to deep Chinese orange. 

This species was referred to by Professor Baird as Uta ornata.^

From Van Deuburfth. 

The followiug is the description given by Mr. Van Denburgh in the 
publication above cited: 

Two specimens of Uta from Lower California, while manifestly related to U. iiU/ri- 
cauda, as shown by the presence of a single fiontal, the general style of the dorsal 
lepidosis, and the coloration, differ so much from that species (by the small size of 
the dorsal scales, the very gradual change from the largest dorsal scales to the gran- 
ular laterals, the blue instead of orange gular patch in the male) as to make their 
separation imperative. 

A single frontal; four large supraoculars; one large and two small projecting 
scales on the anterior border of the ear. The largest dorsal scales are along the 
median line, on each side of which they become gradually smaller, until a granular 
form is assumed, at a distance varying from four to seven rows of scales from the 
median -line. Thirty-four of the largest dorsal scales equal the length of the shielded 
part of the head. A slight dermal fold extends from above the thigh to near the 
upper end of the oval ear opening. There is a strong gular fold, edgecl with rounded 
scales, which are slightly larger than those just in front. The dorsal and posterior

surfaces of tlio tliighs and the posterior surfaces of the arms are finely granular. 
The other portions of the limbs are covered with scales, which are smooth on the ven- 
tral surfaces of the thighs, legs, arms, and forearms, but keeled elsewhere. Scales 
on ventral parts of body smooth. Scales on back of tail much larger than those 
below, both strongly keeled. Femoral pores, fourteen on the left side, thirteen on 
the right. Enlarged postanal plates present. 

Color sooty black, slightly paler below. Back with a few irregularly scattered 
light spots, and with nine pairs of faintly marked vertebral bars of a deeper black. 
Chest and belly indigo; chin and throat azure; pre- and post-anal regions' tinged 
with azure. 

Length of head aud body, 45 mm ; of tail, 84 mm. ; of hind leg, 31 mm. ; of 
fore leg, 21 mm. ; of hind foot, 13 ram. ; of shielded part of head, 10 mm. ; of head to 
posterior border of ear, 11 mm. Depth of head, 6 mm. ; its greatest width, 8 mm. 

Adult male (Type, No. 1221, Leland Stanford Junior University Museum, collected 
by J. M. Stowell, in the San Pedro Martir Mountains, Lower California, June 20 or 21, 
1893). 

Adult female (No. 1222, Leland Stanford Junior University Museum, collected by 
J. M. Stowell in the San Pedro Martir Mountains, Lower California, June 20 or 21, 
1893). Differs from male in having thirty-two instead of thirty-four dorsal scales 
equal to the shielded part of head, and in having fifteen femoral pores. The general 
color is slaty gray, almost white below. Back with dark markings, as in male. A 
gular patch of lemon yellow. 

This species approximates Section C of the genus in the increased 
number and smaller size of the dorsal scales. The larger dorsal scales 
are, however, far less numerous than in U. stanshuriana and U.palmerii, 
there being only eight to fourteen rows, as compared with twice as 
many in the latter. The blue colors also ally it to Section D. 

The name applied to this species by Mr. Van Denburgh being a 
hybrid, I am compelled to modify it so as to express what the discov- 
erer and namer of the species intended to express.

About one-third the body and head very slender; excessively elon- 
gated tail. Head depressed, rather broader than deep; additional 
plates on the rostrum. Large dorsal scales in about six quite regular 
and equal series, not embracing much smaller ones. 

Color above light ashy gray, Avith sometimes a reddish tinge. On 
each side a series of narrow, transverse, dusky bars, sometimes widen- 
ing above; a more distinct band on each side the neck. Beneatli white, 
veined with short, mottled, grayish lines. Male with the sides of belly 
blue, spotted with whitisli. 

The body of this species is very slender, the tail much elongated and 
greatly attenuated, being about ten and a half times the head and body. 
This is cylindrical at base, but soon becomes decidedly compressed, 
the section being vertically elliptical to near the tip, where it is more 
rounded again.

PEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



The head is narrow and high; the Midth equal to the distance from 
snout to beginning of large occipital, or three- fifths the length of lower 
jaw. The snout is rather pointed. The occipital is margined behind 
by three or four irregular series of small plates, larger than those on 
the nape. There are two lateral occipitals, which are displaced by a 
linear extension from the occipital in contact with the first vertical. 
The order of succession of cephalic plates, beginning with the first ver- 
tical, is 1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 6, and ten large internasals besides the ten behind 
each nasal. The nasal [)late is free, as in Uta ornata, the rim projecting 
beyond the encircling plates. The nostrils are oval, and longitudinal, 
instead of oblique. There are two rows of very small plates on the 
inner margin of the supraorbital region, as in other Utas, one sometimes 
wanting aiiit'ri)r]y. There are three series of large transverse plates,

diminishing successively in width and length from the innermost, which 
is largest. Exterior to all is another smaller series within the angular 
imbricated plates on the extreme edge. 

The neck is comparativel}' smooth, with but few folds. There is little 
or no indication of any constriction anterior to the fold on the lower 
part of the throat, and the lateral pit is very faintly indicated. The 
large carinated rhomboid al scales on the back are in about six series 
of nearly uniform width, and without any conspicuously smaller ones 
interspersed either irregularly or along the central line of the back. 
The scales on either side of this central series (occupying about half 
the width of the head) are abruptly much smaller, but show an occa- 
sional larger scale along the crest of the lateral folds of skin (separated 
by about the width of the head). The legs are rather long, though the

hind foot is not one tliiid the head and body. The, free part of longest 
toe reaches to the end of hirge occipital from the snout. The claws are 
short. 

The prevailing color of this species above is a light yellowish gray or 
ash, occasionally with a pale reddish tinge. The sides (to the belly) 
are marked transversely with narrow well-defined blackish lines or 
vertical bars, those of o])posite sides separated along the back by the 
central three or four largo scales, and their upper end sometimes ex- 
tended with short longitudinal lines. There is an occasional tendency 
to anastomoses of adjacent lines. Six or eight of these lines may be 
counted between the legs and anterior to the forearm. Starting on 
the shoulder is another, more distinct, forming a distinct cervical lat- 
eral band. There is a pale border to some of these bars, especially to 
the cervical one. The shoulder shows the dark lines. On the sides 
and back of the neck and sides of the head are numerous alternating- 
faint white and brown longitudinal lines. The under parts, including 
the vent, are whitish, quite conspicuously marked with small s[)Ots and 
short, generally longitudinal, lines of dark gray, formed by minute dots 
on the scales. In the male there is a large light-blue patch on each 
side of the belly extending from fore to hind leg, becoming more 
intense anteriorly, the two separated on the middle line by from one 
to three rows of scales. These patches and the adjacent sides are 
distinctly and closely spotted with white, arranged so systematically 
as posteriorly to have the ai)pearance of occupying the meshes of a 
network of ])lumbeous gray, tinged more or less with blue. There is 
little or no trace of blue on the chin, where the gray lines exhibit a 
tendency to anastomoses. There are indistinct transverse bands on 
the tail (interrupted below). The legs are also banded transversely. 

The female lacks the blue of the belly, and exhibits an interrupted 
dusky stripe on the sides, in continuation of one beginning back of 
the eye and running along the upper edge of the ear. 

There is little difference in form between this species and ornattij 
except in the more elongated body and longer tail. The lengthening of 
the head is accompanied by an increase in the number of cephalic plates. 
Thus the occipitals are more extensively margined behind, having two 
or three more of small plates instead of one. There is also a greater 
number anterior to the central verticals, although these vary a good 
deal. There are, in general, where the symmetry of arrangement is 
in-eserved, five transverse series to the internasals (which make six). 
Some si)ecimeus, however, are scarcely different from ornata in this 
respect. The tail is nuich longer, being two and one-half times instead 
of one and one-half times the head and body. The dorsal large scales 
are more regular, having no small ones interspersed. 

The colors are lighter; the lateral bands narrower; the blue of the 
belly better defined and ligliter, also more conspicuously spotted with 
white behind.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



Concerning the distribution of Uta graciosa, Stejneger in liis report 
on the reptiles of the Death Valley Expedition, states: 

The knowu rauge of this well-named species has been considerably extended by 
the few specimens brought home by Dr. Merriam, inasmuch as it carries it into 
Nevada, the first record for that State. 

Uta graciosa has a very peculiar and considerably restricted distribution, for the 
only definite localities so far recorded show it to be an inhabitant of a narrow strip 
of country on both sides of the Colorado River, probably from its niouth up to the 
beginning of the Great Canyon, and, as now shown, some distance up the Virgin 
River. 

Dr. Merriam in the same publication remarks: 

This slender and agile lizard was not seen in any of the deserts of southern Cali- 
fornia or Nevada, except in extreme eastern Nevada, where it was common at the 
Great Bend of the Colorado; thence northward it was found in a few places iu the 
valley of the Virgin as far north as the Mormon town of Buukerviile, a few miles 
from the northwestern corner of Arizona. It was never seen on the open desert but 
usually on mesquite trees and the faces of clifts, over which it moves with grace and 
agility.

LYSOPTYCHUS Cope. 
Lyaoptyvhus Cope, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XI, 1888, p. 397. 

A loose fold across the throat formed by the conjunction of the pre- 
humeral folds, as in Ctcnosanra, not closely folded nor bordered Avith 
enlarged scales. Femoral i)ores; no preanal pores. No dorsal crest. 
Tympanic disk exposed. 

This genus is intermediate between Seelojwrus and Uta. The loose 
dermal neck-fold, like that of some of the larger genera of Iguanida% 
is not found in the former. The tightly adherent collar of Ufa might 
have been developed from a Sveloporus through a LysopUjchHs. 

But one si)ecies of this genus is knowu.

LYSOPTYCHUS LATERALIS Cope. 



LysoptycUus lateralis Cope, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XI, 1888, p. 397. 

Integument of side of neck thrown into numerous folds. The most 
l)rominent is continuous Avith the collar fold, and it sends out two folds 
forward to the tympanic meatus. A second fold is concentric witli the 
humerus at its anterior base; its superior x)art is ijrominent and longi- 
tudinal, and continues to the fold in front of it. Tail round. 

The scales of the sides are smaller than those of the belly, which are 
smaller than those of the back. The latter are rather small, counting 
seventeen longitudinal rows between the small -lateral scales of the

scapular regions. The keels of the dorsal scales are in parallel lines. 
Scales of the tail subequal, strongly keeled, except below. Fifteen 
femoral pores. Two postanal plates. 

Interparietal plate large, subround; parietals small, subpyriform, 
one fifth as large as the interparietal. Five or six transverse supra- 
orbital plates, separated from the i'rontals by one row and from the 
superciliaries by two rows of scales. Frontal divided transversely, 
the anterior part divided longitudinally. These plates are ])receded 
by two plates, and these by three in transverse relation; two large 
internasals separated from the rostral by two small scales. All the 
scales of the head smooth. 

Color above brown, with laint traces of small darker brown spots. 
Sides blackish, the prominent parts of the folds of the neck paler.

Anterior border of meiitus auditoriiis paler. A large blue i)atch on 
each side of the belly extending from axilla to groin, and not meeting 
its fellow on the middle line. Throat yellowish, faintly reticulated 
with blue. Posterior face of femur with a light band, bordered by 
dark above and below. A black spot on side over scapula.

No gular constriction ; one lateral fold on the neck. Femoral jjores. 
Scales all imbricated; rhomboidal, rather verticillate on tail; above 
generally carinated. Head above with regular plates. Superciliary 
plates imbricate toward a median keystone scale; labials not imbricate. 
Ears distinct. Nostrils superior within thecanthusrostralis. Tongue 
fleshy; arrow-shaped; rounded at tip; broadly adherent, except at end, 
where are two triangular disks beneath. No palatine teeth. Cheek 
teeth compressed, the summit 3-lobed. Tail rounded, very brittle. 

The genus Sceloporus consists of terrestrial, and therefore depressed 
thoracopleurous Iguanida^, with flat scales and distinct parietal scuta, 
and femoral pores, without preanal pores and gular, dermal fold, or 
collar. Its especial habitat is Mexico and Central America, the south- 
western parts of the United States and California. A single species 
ranges over the entire eastern district of the Neartic Realm. Outside 
of the districts named it does not occur. 

Osteology. — As a basis for an examination of the osteology of this 
genus I have before me two skeletons of the 8. undtilatus und one of the 
S. spinosiis, from the U. S. National Museum. 

The premaxillary bone has a long superior spine, and is truncate on 
the palatal face, and has the button-like process. The nostrils are par- 
tially vertical, so that the nasals are a little shortened in front. Tbe 
latter are rather large and are distinct. The frontal is simple and nar- 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 331 

row and is strongly grooved on the middle line below. The parietal is 
short and wide, and is perforated by a large pineal foramen, which 
touches the coronal suture. Parietoquadrate arch distinct. Supra- 
occipital broadly but loosely attached, confluent with exoccipitals. 
Prefrontals large, not reaching postfrontals above; lachrymal small 
and joining jugal. Postfrontal a small splint; postorbital large, exten- 
sively in contact with jugal and supratemporal. Paroccipital small. 
Vomers short, divaricate, and separated by a deep notch behind. Pal- 
atine with the vomerine process longer than the maxillary; palatine 
foramen large. Palatines and pterygoids well separated from each 
other on the middle line; ectopterygoid deflected at its internal extremity. 
Basipterygoids developed. Quadrate with two conchs, the internal the 
narrower. Presphenoid rudimental ; sphenoid and basioccipital coossi- 
tied ; descending lateral processes of the latter strongly developed. The 
supraforaminal part of the petrosal is very short; the infraforaminal 
portion is produced beyond it and is nearly horizontal in position. The 
foramen of eighth nerve is at the bottom of a fossa. Epipterygoid rest- 
ing on ]>terygoid much posterior co ectopterygoid and reaching parietal 
without touching petrosal. Occipital condyle not subdivided by 
grooves. 

The hyoid system includes a pair of well-separated, short, second 
ceratobranchials, and rather long and slender first ceratobranchials and 
ceratohyals, which have no expansions. Hypobranchials moderate, 
supporting ceratohyals at extremities. 

Mandible with Meckel's cartilage exposed at the distal part. Coro- 
uoid not horizontally produced on external face. Articular and sur- 
angular united. Splenial moderately elongate; dentary extending 
behind coronoid on external face and deeply notched. Angle short, 
hdrizontal, with short internal angle. Five cervicals with intercentra 
in S. uudulatus and six in S. spinosus; three without ribs in both. Ribs 
extending to sacrum. Sacral centra not coossifled. Sacral diapophyses 
coossitied distally; the second with a posterior free angle distally. 
Caudal diapophyses well developed at base of tail. From about the 
eighth caudal the centra are segmented in front of the middle. 

Scapula with proscapular process ; coracoid with one notch. Sternum 
with a very large fontanelle. Two ribs join the sternal plate; one 
comes off the base of the xiphoid rod, and two articulate with the latter; 
total, five pairs. The ilium has a small angulus crista^ and the aceta- 
bulum is not emargiuate behind. The pubes are nearly transverse, and 
tlie pectineal angle is external. The ischia are rather slender, and the 
tuber is an angle. 

The middle and posterior teeth are feebly tridentate; the others are 
simple. 

Viscera. — The liver is deeply emarginate posteriorly, and the left lobe 
is larger than in many other genera of Iguanida". There is a distinct 
colon. Tlie mesenteries are of the type most common in Sauria with 
the exception that there are commonly two hepatoventral sheets. 



332 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

The hemipeiiis is bifurcate, and lias a strong welt opposite to tlie 
sulcus spermaticus. The surface of the organ including the welt is 
covered with a rather close honeycomb structure without the interrup- 
tions seen in the genera more nearly allied to Iguana, etc. 

Reproduction. — The males are generally more brilliantly colored, and 
larger than the females. The latter are generally oviparous, but the 
species 8. viviparus of the warmer parts of Mexico is viviparous. 

The species agree in possessing the following external characters: 
Head, depressed, tetrahedral, rather broad ; behind the forehead, sloping. 
Canthus rostralis continued nearly to the end of the snout; the nostrils 
superior; plates on the top of head large, not many in number, and quite 
symmetrically arranged. The supraorbital region, with one or two cen- 
tral series of large transverse plates, bordered internally by one, exter- 
nally by one or two series of small plates independently of the elongated, 
angular ones forming the extreme edge of this region or jiart of the 
canthus rostralis. There is a large occipital, with a smaller on either 
side, sometimes with a line of two or three. Next comes two plates 
between the orbit, sometimes with a smaller interposed, sometimes dis- 
placed by the occipital. Next a vertical, followed by a second, which is 
sometimes divided into two lateral. Then come two plates, then three, 
then four to the nasal plates, with four between them. An additional 
rostral median jilate is sometimes inserted, around which are grouped 
four or five scales; this involves a difl'erent arrangement of the remain- 
ing ones. The nostrils themselves are rounded and situated in the 
center of a single nasal plate. 

There is no fold on the throat, the scales there being like those on 
the breast. There is, however, an oblique fold of skin on each side the 
neck covered with large scales and overlying a pit lined with fine gran- 
ular scales*and usually harboring Acari. 

All the scales on the body are ovate, imbricate, and generally strongly 
carinated, except below. The upper ones generally have a prominent 
spine behind, and the edges are more or less denticulated, rarely even. 
The scales of under surface are usually notched or emarginate between. 
They are sometimes faintly carinated, with those on the inside of tibia. 
The relative proportions of scales on different parts of the body varies 
considerably Avith the species. 

The ears are distinct, usually with a serrated margin anteriorly. 
There are eight to twenty femoral pores, but no anal ones. The male 
has two or more large concave plates just behind the anus, which are 
wanting in the female. 

The color varies with the species, though there is generally a light 
lateral stripe (sometimes two) on each side. The back is marked with 
transverse dark lines or with blotches. The males have a blue blotch 
on the under surface and on the sides of belly. 

The species are rather numerous. Since Wiegmann described the 
most abundant of the Mexican species, synopses have been published 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 333 

by DuiiK'ril aud Bibroii, Bocourt and myself. Bocourt has published 
also, in the Report of the Mission Scientitique of Mexico, most admi- 
rable plates of many of the species. I have given a synopsis of the 
species,^ twenty nine in number. The material which has furnished 
the basis of the ijresent work is largely the property of the U. S. 
National Museum at Washington. It has been furnished by the follow- 
ing naturalists: Messrs. Riotte, Van Patten, Hague, Berendt, Sumich- 
rast, Xantus, Sartorius, Duges, Potts, and Major. On my own part, I 
have received specimens from Messrs. Duges, Hoege, Ferrari-Perez, 
Yillada, Herrera, and Beriiad. To all of these gentlemen I wish to 
extend my thanks for their kind attention in the matter. 

The distinction of many of the species of this genus is not accom- 
Ijlished without difticulty. 1 recommend it as an excellent ]}iece de 
rhistance for those persons who do not believe in the doctrine of deriva- 
tion of species. There are some characters, it is true, which are not 
subject to such variation as to be embarrassing. Such are the greater 
or less number of femoral j)ores, and the granular lateral scales of some 
of the species. The carination and wrinkling of the head scales is fre- 
quently a valid character, but is especially unreliable in the 8. undulatns, 
and one or two other species. The size of the dorsal scales varies in 
most of the species; the number entering a head length varying two to 
three in the large-scaled spaces, and three or four in the small scaled 
ones. The division of the supraocular plates into two or more rows is 
constant in a few species only; in others it is variable, notably in the« 
S. torquatus. The longitudinal division of the anterior frontal is con- 
stant in the S. variahilis, S. siniferus, and /S'. squamosum, but is i)resent 
or absent indifferently in several others. The number of sui^raoculars 
in the principal row may be four or five in most of the species. 

The greatest difiBculty is experienced in distinguishing the North 
American species. They are much fewer in number than has been rep- 
resented to be the case, and the few that are admissible do not present 
the strong characteristics that most of those of more southern regions 
do. The S. undulaina has an almost continental distribution in North 
America, within the range of temperate and subtropical climates. 

The arrangement of numerous species of the genus into groups is a 
matter of much ditlficulty, owing to their gentle gradations of form and 
the sometimes slight difference in color. The number and arrangement 
of the supraorbital plates and the verticals furnish good characters, 
though sometimes varying somewhat in the species. The arrangement 
of the cervical jilates can not be relied on entirely for specific charac- 
ters, although the average is much the same in the species. 

While the species of Sceloporus possess brilliant colors, these are gen- 
erally on the inferior surfaces and are therefore concealed. The throat 
and sides of the belly are usually of some shade of blue (sometimes 
purple), while the dorsal regions are, in a majority of species, different 



'Proceedings of the Aiuericau Philosophical Society for 1885, p. 400. 



334 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

sliades of brown, although in some (as S. malachiUcus) this region also 
is of some shade of green or blue. 

When the animal raises the head, as it habitually does, the brilliant 
colors of the throat are visible, but those of the sides are much less 
apparent. All these colors are most conspicuous in the males, and in 
many species they are absent from the females. They are to be regarded 
as secondary sexual characters, and are i)robably visible to the females 
at the time of copulation, since the inferior surfaces of the sexes are 
then in juxtaposition. 

The species of Sceloporus are conspicuous objects wherever one travels 
in the southern United States and Mexico. In the eastern district of 
Nearctica the 8. undnlatus is seen running on fences and walls. In 
Texas the 8. spinosus runs up trees with great activity, dodging the 
pursuer behind branches, with good result to himself. In southern 
Texas and in Mexico 8. torquatus is constantly seen on the vertical 
faces of rocks that so frequently border the highways, hiding in fissures 
from enemies, and often attracting the attention of the most careless 
observer. Throughout Mexico the 8. micro! epidotus runs over the hori- 
zontal rock surfaces and stone walls, where it finds concealment. So 
the 8. scalaris haunts the soil and sand, and hides in holes that are 
always convenient. 

Thirty-four species are known to me, and are distinguished in the 
following analytical table. About half of them belong to Nearctica and 
half to the Central American region of Neotropica. None are found 
elsewhere. In Costa Eica at one extremity of the distribution there is 
but one species {8. malachiUcus)^ and there is but one in the eastern 
region of Nearctica (^S". undulatus).

Tlie ffenus Sceloporus in Nearctica belongs especially to the Sonoran 
rey ion. jS^o species has a range exclusively outside of that region iu any 
other part of iSTearctica, with the possible exception of a species or two 
iu Lower California and the S. tkayerU iu southwest Texas. S. tor- 
<iu(itns, S.spinosus, S. rariahilis, and 8. scalaris are not Sonoran species, 
but they are Mexicans which pass over our borders. From the Sonoran 
ceuter S. undulatus radiates in one form or another all over the conti- 
nent south of the Canadian district. 8. graciosus ranges the whole 
length of the Great Basin, and 8. clarMi, in its forms 8. Heidi and 8, 
zo.steromus, into and to the end of the Lower Californian Peninsula. 
The only possible exception to the above statement is the 8. orcuttii, 
which is found near the coast in southern California, and with a few 
other species of reptiles characterizes a limited district, whose distinct- 
ness is so far uncertain. In Xearctica the distribution of this genus is 
closely similar to that of Cnemidophoriis. 

The geographical distribution of the species, so far as now known, is 

as follows:

In this tabic is shown a gradual transition of specific distribution from 
the north to the south of the Central American region, some species 
being common to two districts. The same is true of the regions of tlie 
Nearctic realm, and were the divisions of the latter determined by the 
species of Sceloporus they would have no greater value than those of 
the Central American region of the Neotropical. They are, however, 
distinguished by differences in the distribution of other types of ani- 
mals, and are of much greater significance than the divisions of tlie 
Central American region. 

Several species of the genus inhabit the adjacent areas of both 
Faunae. Thus 8. grammicus and S. microlepidoius occur in both the 
Tierra Teniplada (i?. nearctica) and Tierra Caliente {R. neotropica) of Mex- 
ico. The »S'. variabilis and S. torqiiatus extend from the eastern Tierra 
Caliente a short distance into Texas, and these species should perhaps 
be omitted from our fauna. The *S'. spinosus appears to be a full member 
of both of the great Fauna?, extending from tlie State of Puebla as far 
as Florida. The distribution of the *S'. (jraciosus is still more anomalous. 
It belongs to the central desert region of the F. nearctica as far north 
as Oregon, but I have seen specimens which I can not distinguish from 
it from near Jalapa, which is well south in the Tierra Templada of 
Vera Cruz. The proper geographical location of the 8. thaycrii Baird 
and Girard and 8. heterolepis Boulenger is yet uncertain.

Sceleporus intermedins A. DuGi^s, La Naturaleza, Mexique, IV, 1876, p. 29, pi. I, 
figs. 21-32. 
A rather large species with the body depressed. Upper cephalic 
plates smooth. Two scutella on the upper border of each angular ridge 
of the muzzle. Supraocular scales relatively small, a very little wider 
than long. On the anterior edge of the auricular border are flat 
scales a little wider than those in front. Scales on the back of average 
dimensions, obtuse, and feebly carinated; nine to twelve of these scales 
equal the length of the upper surface of the head. Scales on the flanks 
just a little smaller; those of the belly one-third smaller than those of 
the back. Tail covered with scales much larger than those on the back. 
Thirteen to tifteen femoral pores. Upper part of the body shaded from 
olive to dark umber, with a brown scapular collar border on the front 
edge witli yellow. The males have the breast yellow and the sides of 
the abdomen blue. 

Head relatively short, depressed, and wide through the temples; its 
length is a little less than oue-tifth the distance from the chin to the 
anus. Seven polygonal prefrontal plates, the two anterior ones being 
much smaller than the others; two froutal plates; the first, rather large, 
is wide in front and slightly concave; the second is smaller, hexagonal, 
and is in contact at the posterior angle with the anterior angle of the 
occipital plate. This, in turn, somewhat larger, is narrow in front, having 
the lateral borders parallel, and is in contact, right and left, with a 



342 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

frouto parietal aud a temporal scute. Supraocular scales jjolygoual, in 
two or three longitudinal rows, surrounded by scutella; those of the 
internal row are relatively large and are wider than long. Labial 
scales rectangular, eight above and ten below; above the upper ones 
there are one or two series of elongated, x)rojecting scales. Auditory 
meatus bordered anteriorly with iiat scales, wide and pointed, larger 
even than the keeled scales which border them in front. Scales of the 
neck and back short, obtuse, with the keel not prolonged and the notch 
indistinct; they are arranged in from forty- four to forty-eight oblique 
rows, which converge posteriorly on the posterior dorsal region, from 
the nape of the neck to the level of the posterior part of the thighs. The 
scales on the flanks have the keel prolonged in a point, obliquely directed 
from below. Tail rather long, depressed at the base, but rounded for 
the rest of its length, covered with high-keeled scales, one- fourth larger 
than the dorsal ones, forming transverse rows throughout nearly the 
entire length. Legs short, covered with scales resembling those on the 
upper part of the trunk, but a little smaller. Length of tibia scarcely 
greater than that of the upper surface of the head. Scales of the 
chest and belly one-third larger than the dorsals, not showing any hol- 
lowing out on their free borders. Femoral pores large, from thirteen 
to fifteen under each thigh. In the males there are two large concave 
scales behind the anus, generally separated from each other by two 
scutella. 

Measurements. — Total length of the largest specimen, 190 mm. ; length 
of head from the end of the muzzle to the i^osterior border of the occipi- 
tal plate, 15.5 mm,; width of head through the temples, 17 mm.; length 
of trunk from chin to anus, SO mm.; length of tail, 110 mm.; length of 
tibia, 17 mm. 

Color of upper part of body burnt umber, varied with olive, with a 
black spot in front of the arm and a brown scai)ular collar bordered on 
its front edge with yellow. On the middle dorsal region there is a 
double series of small, dark spots very close together; irregular black 
spots on the sides form oblique lines extending from the front over the 
flanks; brown bands cross the legs and tail. The males have the 
throat blue, with dark lines directed obliquely inward. The sides of 
the abdomen are also blue, and this color patch is bordered on the 
inner side with black from the armpit to the groin, from which point 
the same tint extends over the under side of the thighs. Breast yellow, 
spotted with gray; median abdominal region yellowish white, as is also 
the rest of the under side. The females resemble the males in respect 
to the superior regions, but have their under i)arts yellow and the 
throat rayed with blue. 

Sceloporus dugesU resembles, at first sight, two distinct species — 
Sceloporus torquatus, characterized by very large dorsal scales, and 
Sceloporus fjrammknis, with the same scales relatively small. But this 
resemblance is only apparent and is due to a similarity of coloration

aiul to the scaimlar collar loiiud oii all three species. Sceloporns (lu<ienii 
is distinguished by the characters given above and principally by the 
small dorsal scales, which are wide, obtuse, without serrations, and 
with the keel not terminating in a point. It is most nearly allied to 
the Sceloporus oraatns Baird, with which it agrees in the form of the 
scales and in the coloration, but the scales in the former appear to be 
suKillei and the blue of the belly lacks the bn id black border.

with a series of black or bluish lines, which converge posteriorly on a 
paler or deeper yellow ground. Top of the head bright chestnut-red; 
the (bntanelle white or pink, surrounded by a pale area. In females 
the head is brown above, excei)t the parietal spot; the lateral stripe is 
obsolete, and the blue marks of the sides of the abdomen are replaced 
by brown.

Supraorbitals as in S. torquatns poinsettii, except that the inner cres- 
cent of large plates embraces that exterior to it in its convexity. Only 
one median cephalic plate, but a second probably suppressed. The por- 
-tiou of hind toe about five-sevenths the cephalic plates. Scales small; 
dorsal scales narrow ; the outlines rounded, though rhomboidal; dis- 
tinctly carinated, but without free spine or lateral denticulations; 
lower scales scarcely emarginated. Dorsal scales equal to those on the 
rump, which are abruptly much smaller than those on the tail; not

larger than those on the sides. Abont sixty-four series from head to 
tail, or about forty-six from cervical fokl ; femoral pores about twelve. 

Color above dark green, becoming nearly black on the middle of 
back. A conspicuous nuchal black collar, margined before and behind, 
and banded transversely above with yellowish green: back spotted 
with the same; head angular, rather i)ointed, but rounded at the end. 
The first median plate sujjpressed, the second very large. Four rows 
of plates on the supraorbital region; cephalic plates smooth; scales on 
the body quite small, there being at least sixty around the middle of the 
body. A few only of the lower scales are notched. The under surface 
of tibia and post anal region are smooth. The hind feet are short, the 
free portion of length not reaching from snout to beginning of occipital 
plate. The tail is much thickened, decidedly wider behind the anus 
than at its root. 

There is a broad black collar, which, beginning on and in front of the 
shoulders, crosses the nape, where it is ten scales long. It is bordered 
before and behind by yellowish green (the posterior band crossing the 
shoulders) and crossed centrally above by a transverse bar of the same. 
From this collar to above the anus, along the middle of the back, are 
eight or ten indistinct transverse dotted bars of light yellowish green, 
with smaller and more irregular ones on the sides. The under parts 
are greenish white; the head beneath and the sides of belly blue. 

This species, with the general appearance of S. torquatns, is readily 
distinguished by the much smaller scales, without denticulation above. 
Of these there are more than 00 oblique rows from head to tail, instead 
of only about 40. 

It differs from *S'. formosus in the smaller scales, and the presence of 
light margins to the cervical collar and of light spots on the back.

Each scale of the upper surface of the body is marked by a light 
spot, which was some brilliant shade, probably yellow, during life. 
Behind the interscapular region and on the tail they are light blue; top 
of head and neck bluish black, the latter inclosed in a rectangular area,

bounded by a light band from eacli squamosal region. Sides of neck 
with a broad black collar, bluish black; the collar with a light poste- 
rior border above ; the dark color extending over the shoulder, the sides 
of the head, and the throat. A light band above the upper labials and 
a i)arallel one below the inferior labials. 

A very handsome species, allied to the iS. torquatus, iS. ornatus, etc., 
resembling in a slight degree iS./ormosus, but is quite distinct, as the 
following diagnosis will show. 

The distinctive characters of these species are as follows : 

S. jarrovii. — Parietals 2; scales* hi vertebral line from occiput to opposite groin, 39. 
Dorsal scales all with yellow ciMiters ; two light bands on side of neck, the iijjper 
from the cje and continuous with the anterior border of the collar, the lower com- 
mencing at tlie muzzle; nape black. 

N. ornatus — Parietal single; scales to opposite groin, 50; above black, with two 
or more longitudinal rows of irregular light spots; no bands on side of neck; nape 
spotted. 

Dedicated to Dr. H. (J. Yarrow, the surgeon and zoologist of the expedition for 
"Explorations West of the One-hundredth Meridian." 

This handsome species has been found so far only in Arizona.

SCELOPORUS TORQUATUS PEALE AND GREENE. 

X g. 

Cat. No. 71-22, U.S.N.M. 

Color dark green above, with a neutral black collar bordered before 
and behind by light yellowish green, this anteriorly interrupted by 
black. Middle of back and nape spotted with light greenish. Beneath 
yellowish. Male with chin and sides of belly blue. 

The most difficult problems to settle in the genus Sceloporus are the 
limits of the species S. torquatus and JS. undulatus. With considerable 
material and the experience of Mr. Bocourt before me, I do not feel that 
I can make more than a contribution to the qxiestion as regards the 
8. torquatus. The collection of individuals I include under that name 



CROCODILTANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 349 

eiubraces some with one row of large supraocular plates, and some with 
two; some Avith mucronate, and others with eutire dorsal scales in 
numbers varying from twenty-five to thirty-five between occiput and 
groin; specimens with the anterior collar border divided and those 
where it is entire, and those with blue and those with gray throat and 
cliin. In the following synopsis of varieties I indicate the localities 
where they are derived. 

I. One row of large supraocular scales. 

Dorsal scales not mucronat*' ; collar border not interrupted. 

(From .Jalapa.) »*?• f- torqnatHS. 

IT. Two rows of large supraocular plates. 

Dorsal scales not mucronate; collar border not interrupted; nowhere blue. 

S. t.poinsettli. 
(Four from S. W. Texas, Coin-, and two from uncertain Mexican localities.) 
Dorsal scales not mucronate; collar with anterior border divided; back dark 
spotted, sometimes with light borders; chin, throat, and sides blue. 

S. 1. cjianogeni/s. 
(Seven from Monterey, Nuevo Leon, Cope.) 
Dorsal scales strongly mucronate; anterior collar border divided, and forming 
two yellow spots on nape; sides blue; chin and throat not blue. 

S. i. mucronatiis. 
(Four from Vera Cruz, Sartorius.) 
Dorsal scales strongly mucronate, a little smaller (eight eiinaliug head); collar 
very slightly interrupted, borders very pale ; green sides and narrow inferior 

collar blue ; chin and throat not blue S. i.formosus. 

Four from Jalapa, Montis de Oca. 

As in S. t. ciianogenys, but scales smaller ; 8-10 in head ; smaller S.t. minor. 

Two specimens from Dtiges, ? locality. 

Finally, the second form described under ^S*. niehoiof/a.ster may consti- 
tute another variety approaching the 8. t. iorqnatuH., but with the ante- 
rior collar border interrupted as in S. t. cyanogenys, and the back 
s])otted as in S. t. formosus. 

Should the interruption of the collar seen in the 8. serrifer prove to 
be an inconstant character, that form must be regarded as subordinate 
to the ;S'. torquatus, entering Section I, but related to the S. t. inucronatus. 
Should the anterior canthal scale appear in the IS. melanof/aster, uothiug 
but color will distinguish it from the *S'. /. torqttatus, but the strongly 
nnicronate scales, and the very different color, which is, however, 
weakened in importance by the S. t. cyanof/enys with its blue chin and 
throat. 

The definition of the ^S'. /. torquatus is taken from the type of Peale 
and Greene, which is, however, in the Museum of the Philadelphia 
Academy. It is correctly identified and figured by l>ocourt. 

Boulenger in the Catalogue of the Lizards in the British Museum 
regards the 8. t. formosus as a distinct species, and the S. melanogasfer 
and S./errariperezi as varieties of the 8. torquatus. He nnites the var. 
cyanogenys with the war. poinsettii. 

The 8. t. poinsettii is the only form which has been found within the 
limits of the United States. The 8. t. cyanogenys is found so near to 



350 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

our bouiulary that it is not uulikelj^ to be found within our limits. 
Indeed, I am not sure that I did not see this animal on the rocky banks 
of the Eio Grande at Laredo, Texas, in 1885.

SCELOPORCS TORliUATUS POINSETTII I'.AIKl) AND (JlRARD. 

Texas. 

Cst. No. 9920, II.S.N.M. 

Sceloporus poinsettii. — A very large occipital, the encircling plates 
small, and the middle cephalic plates generally not regular. Supraor- 
bitals and anterior cephalic plates as in S. iorquatus (the former in five 
series). Free portion of hind toe scarcely three-fifths the length of 
cephalic ])lates. Scale on back very broad, semicircular; along the 
middle very obsoletely carinated, and all without spine, but denticu- 
lated freely, as are the inferior scales. The more lateral dorsal scales 
more distinctly carinate and spinous. Dorsal scales a little larger than 
those on rump, but scarcely narrower than the caudal. Inferior tibial 
scales smooth. Thirty-two oblique rows of scales from head to tail, 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 351 

of which about twenty-two are from the cervical fohl. Femoral pores, 
eleveu. 

Above yellowish green, with a well-marked neutral black collar, 
margined before and behind by yellowish. Back with transverse bars 
of dusky, forming distinct half rings on the tail. 

l»ody stout, thickened; much depressed. Head scarcely wider than 
the neck. Tail cylindrical, except at the base, where it is much 
depressed; its under surface flattened; its length about li times that 
of head and body. Occipital plate large, nearly square; its width 
equal to the distance between the outer borders of the nostrils. Supra- 
orbital plates rather irregular, in two series of large, bordered inter- 
nally by one row and externally by one or two of smaller (making four or 
five), exclusive of those forming the extreme edge. Infraorbital series 
formed of five or six plates, of which the horizontal one is twice as 
large as that anterior to it. 

Scales on the body very large, spinous and crestless. Those on the 
back are twice as wide as those on the belly; rather broader than 
long; subcircular or subhexagonal and very thin. These are smooth 
on the under surftice, except beneath the feet, but decidedly carinated on 
the sides and above, most especially on the tail. Those along the middle 
of the back (ten or twelve) rows are either very obsoletely carinated 
(as in Cat. Nos. 2952, 2933) or not at all. All the scales on the upper 
surface of the back and tail are denticulated; a larger tooth or spine 
in the center, and usually two or three on each side. On the back the 
central spine is but little longer than the lateral, owing to the trunca- 
tion of the scale; on the tail, however, it is much longer, the scale very 
acute. There are about fourteen <piite distinct femoral pores. 

There are about forty-eight rows of scales encircling the body at the 
thickest part. Of these about seventeen are on the back, as nearly as 
can be estimated. At a distance from the anus equal to that from the 
nose to the hinder edge of occipital plate the tail is encircled by thirteen 
rows of scales. 

In alcohol the color of this species is yellowish, with about seven 
transverse, broad, dusky bands above from head to opposite anus and 
as many thence to tip of tail. There are also traces of two or three on 
top of head; of these the one which extends between the shoulders is 
very distinct, crescentic in shape, and continuously black. The others 
are only faintly indicated by dusky sides to the scales. In the male 
the chin or space beneath the head is blue, and there is an elongated 
blue patch on each flank, margined internally and behind by black, 
more extended in the groin. The two patches are separated on the belly 
by about ten scales; they are very indistinct anteriorly. The remain- 
ing under parts are plain yellow. A supposed female (Cat. I^o. 29526) 
has a trace of blue on chin, but none on the flanks. 

In a specimen (Cat. No. 2955) the black collar on the neck above is 
extended across the throat. The dark dorsal bands are confined to the 



352 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

central region for a width of some six scales, where the scales are more 
continuously colored than in Cat. No. 29o2. Some of these scales have 
a tinge of green. The black cervical collar above is margined before 
and behind by a lighter shade of the ground color; as in Cat. No. 2952, 
there is one dusky band on the nape. The scales on the supraorbital 
region are more broken up and tubercular; the occipital plate narrower. 
The blue or green of the sides has no black margin anteriorly or exter- 
nally. It extends nearly to the axillae. 

In some specimens the chin is spotted with blackish. In many the 
scales on the chin and sides are yellowish, but when removed the sub- 
jacent skin is seen to be bluish. 

In Cat. No. 2960 the ground color on the back is greenish, with an occa- 
sional yellowish scale; the blotches and cervical crescent, as described. 
The chin is greenish, with a longitudinal line of yellowish; the lateral 
region spotted with the same. There are obsolete bands of lighter on 
the back between the dusky portions. 

This species is very similar to S. torquatus Wiegmann in general 
appearance and character, but differs in several appreciable points. The 
plates on top of head are much more irregular. Then there is no sym- 
metrical lateral occipital, although there is a plate larger than the others 
adjacent to it. The .second series of three plates is entirely broken u]} 
into irregular small ones; the more anterior ones are jiretty much the 
same in both. The supraorbital plates are much more irregular and 
tubercular, the central ones smaller. There is no tangible diflerence in 
the infraorbital series. The plates on the temporal region, between the 
eye and ear, and those on the under surface of feet are considerably 
larger. The fingers and toes are shorter. The scales on the middle of 
the back are flatter, more membranaceous, more truncate behind, and 
much less connected — in fact, usually smooth. 

The color differs in being yellowish above instead of green; the dor- 
sal blotches and the large blue patch on the flank, are more distinct. 
The black collar is more crescentic or rounder behind than V-shaped, 
and lacks the distinct process separating the yellowish anterior margin. 
The light markings anterior to the collar and its margin are in the form 
of transverse bands, not spots. 

The largest of its genus found in Texas, this species has nearly the 
range of the S. spinosus. I found it very abundant in the first plateau 
region as far as the upper waters of the Guadalupe, It differs in its 
habits from the 8. spinosus, being exclusively a dweller in rocks. It 
maybe seen at any time running over the limestone clifi's of the plateau 
region, to which its light colors present but little contrast. The relation 
between its color and habitat is quite as striking as in the S. spinosus.

longer than broad. Frontal and frontoparietal broad; former longer, 
undivided, l^ivided frontonasals and internasals in contact; supra- 
orbitals in contact with both marginals and superciliary ridge, four on 
each side. Three pairs infralabials, transverse, the anterior barely in 
contact. Three bordering scales of car, not larger than those preced- 
ing. End of nui/zle to ear, 2.3 mm. ; ear to vent, 80 mm. ; length of tail, 
75 mm.; length of anterior extremity, 17 mm.; posterior, 14.7 mm.; hind

the back. Top of head red, below whitish, sides faintly blue tinged. 
Females brown-olive, with a ])aler dorsolateral band. Throat, a broad 
band to shoulders and sides of abdomen blue. 

This species is especially characterized by the small number of its 
femoral pores. It differs further from the S. spinosus and agrees Avith 
the species of the tS. clarldi group in the absence of small scales 
between the supraoculars and frontoparietals.

SCELOPORUS ORCUTTII Stejneger. 

Scvloporns orcidtii Ste.jnegek, North American Fauna, No. 7, 1893; p. 181, pi. i, 
lig. 4. 

Dorsal and lateral scales large, subequal; ventral scales a little 
smaller. Femoral pores, 13-15. Head scales smooth ; frontal not lon- 
gitudinally divided; two parietals on each side. 

Scales rounded, not keeled, the border serrate with a moderately 
prominent, Hat median point. Caudal scales with longer and recurved 
points. Scales of inferior surfaces notched; those of the limbs above 
keeled and mucronate, below little notched or entire. Dorsal scales 
in parallel rows; of sides oblique upward and backward. Two scales 
on the canthus rostralis. One row of transverse scales above the 
orbit, which are separated from the frontals forward by one row of 
small scales, but are in contact with the froutoijarietals and parie- 
tals. Two parietals; the anterior rhomboidal, the posterior transverse.

Seven dorsal scales in a head length, and twelve ventrals. Eighteen 
scales between groin and humerus, and nine scales from above middle 
of humerus to interparietal i)late. Four superior labial i^lates, the last 
very narrow, and separated from the orbit by two lows of scales and a 
narrow suborbital plate. A series of long, mucronate, chaffy scales in 
front of the auricular meatus, which is followed by large chafity scales, 
of which the posterior row overhangs a pocket which is lined with 
granular scales. Limbs and digits rather short and robust, the longest 
toe of the oppressed hind limb reaching the front of the auricular 
meatus.

fore limb, 41 mm.; length of fore foot, 10 mm.; length of hind limb, 
63 mm.; length of hind foot, 30 mm. 

The coloration of tliis species is peculiar and striking. The ground 
on the middle dorsal region is browu, and on the sides blackish. In 
smaller specimens there are transverse rows of whitish scales which

give ;i cross-buuded result; the tail is blackish, and the inferior sur- 
faces are light bluish. In adults the colors are more brilliant. The 
median dorsal scales have a blue spot at the base and a reddish spot 
at each margin. On the laterals three or four spots are present, but 
they may be blue, green, or reddish, giving on some scales an ocel- 
lated effect, the whole being quite kaleidoscopic. The head, limbs, 
and tail are dark blue, as are all the inferior surfaces excepting an 
obscure paler space connecting the axilhe. 

This species is nearly related to the aS'. clarkii Baird and Girard, but 
differs in the presence of two i)arietal plates on each side, in the absence 
of keelson the scales, and in the coloration. The posterior parietal plates 
articulate with the interparietal, and are not entirely posterior, as rep- 
resented in Dr. Stejneger's otherwise excellent figures. The character 
of the coloration is very handsome in adults and is unique in the genus. 

In its geographical range the 8. orcuttii is restricted to southwest 
California in the mountainous region near the coast. It is named for 
Mr. C. E. Orcutt. a well-known naturalist of San Diego.

into blue on sides and throat. Chin light green. P>rachiuni black in 
front. In younger specinuMis the prebrachial spot often does not con- 
nect with the lateral abdominal band. 

A large species to be compared with the S. clarlii, which is foun<l in 
Texas and Arizona. The latter has a shorter prefrontal plate, greater 
size, and different coloration. 

In two specimens received since the above descri]>tion was written 
(Cat. No. 11071) the entire inferior surfaces, excepting the cliin, gular 
region, tail, tibia", and feet, are bluish black.

Cepbalic plates very large and regular; only one series of five large, 
transverse, supraorbital plates, bordered internally and externally by 
very small ones, the internal border wanting behind. Lateral occipi- 
tals nearly as large as middle cephalic plates; otherwise much as in 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 359 

S. torquatiis, excei)t that there are two single verticals. Free portion 
of longest toe nearly equal to the cephalic i)lates, reaching from muzzle 
to middle of occipital. Scales on back strongly carinated and acutely 
pointed, with a conspicuous, but not entirely free, spine. Two or three 
distinct lateral denticulations. Belly scales notched. No conspicuous 
difference in size between scales of back, rump, and tail above ; the first, 
however, larger than those on sides. Scales smooth on the inside of 
tibia. About thirty-two oblique rows of scales from head to tail, 
twenty-two from cervical fold. Femoral pores, fourteen or fifteen. 

Color, yellowish green, with a distinct, cervical, black collar, broadly 
interrupted above and continued below across the throat; not mar- 
gined. Back with dull, obscure, transverse bars and a series of dusky 
spots beneath a rather lighter lateral line. 

In this species the head is scarcely wider than the neck. The wide 
space between the true marginal series of plates is occupied by one 
series of five, broad, short plates. Of these, the two posterior are in 
immediate contact with the occipitals; the others cut off from the 
median ones. The other plates which occupy the remaining j)ortion of 
the head are arranged as follows : Beginning with the posterior, or occi- 
pitals, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, and perhaps 2, 2 smaller ones, to the nostrils, 
although this space is sometimes much broken up. The occipitals are 
large; the two of the second row are separated by the contact of the 
middle one of first row and the third; the two of the fifth row likewise 
separated by the contact of fourth and middle fifth. The infraorbital 
chain is composed chiefly of one large horizontal plate. The temporal 
scales are large, about six series intervening between the orbital chain 
and the ear. 

All the upper and lateral scales, as well as those on the under sur- 
face of the feet, are strongly carinated; the carina extended into a con- 
spicuous spinous point. Those on both upper and under surface 
herein, besides ending in a point, have the posterior edge denticulated 
on each side of this, seen even on the chin. 

The general color of this species in the alcoholic specimen is a yellow- 
ish olive above, with a series of transverse but obsolete dusky bars, of 
which there are perhaps ten from the cervical collar to above the anus 
and continued to the tip of tail. These appear to be separated by 
rather lighter intervalsand themselves to be almost broken up into about 
four blotches. There is a slight indication of a V-shaped blackish-green 
collar on the side of the neck, just against the shoulder; but this is 
interrupted on the back, the branches running out to a point. Below, 
it is continued across the throat as a dusky green baud, and the sides 
of the chin being of the same color, they bound a triangular blue spot 
beneath the head. There is also a blue patch on each side the belly, 
extending from fore to hind legs and scarcely separated on the median 
line. It appears to be rather darker internally and behind. 

A specimen (Oat. Xo. 21)(;4) in better condition than the type (Cat. No. 



360 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

2940a) differs mainly iu having the cephalic plates of the first and third 
series and the fourth and sixtli separated by second and tifth. The 
upper parts show the four series of blotches above, about seven from 
the collar to above anus. They are arranged in two series of rounded 
blackish spots close together along the back, occui^ying a breadth of 
some six scales; then an interval of two or three rows lighter than the 
ground color; then a lateral series of rounded blotches, or two or three 
rows. They are all (]uite obsolete, however. The black, interrupted 
half collar on the hinder part of the neck is indicated above by an 
obsolete, dusky band. The center only of the chin is blue, the space 
covered by blackish green iu Cat. No. 2940a being here only greenish 
white. The ventral blue patches are only indicated behind, very 
slightly internally. The groin is much marked with blackish. 

A specimen of this vSpecies sent me from San Bernardino, California, 
by my friend, Mr. J. S. Lippincott, has six brown cross-bands on the 
body, and a vertical prehumeral brown band which nearly meets the 
corresponding one on the other side. These bands are broadly yellow- 
bordered posteriorly, and are continued with the yellow borders as 
oblique bars on the sides to the belly. The individual is a female. 

This species is readily distinguished from >S'. torquatus and iHnnsetUi 
by the large plates in the su])raocular region and other peculiarities 
about the head. The dark dorsal bars, instead of being continuous, are 
broken up into ibur blotches. The cervical collar is greatly interrui)ted 
above. The blue patch on the belly is much closer, the blue of chin is 
more restricted, and usually encircled by dusky greenish. 

Dr. Stejneger regards' the »9. maf/isfer of llallowell as a s]>ecies dis- 
tinct from the /S'. clarkii. The only characters which he gives are the 
longer preauricular scales of the former and the presence of dusky 
cross-markings on the forearm and hand. He gives figures of the heads 
of the two supposed species, but the differences there shown do not, 
in my opinion, warrant the recognition of the ^S. magistcr as distinct. 
According to Jouy, who observed the species in life, the two forms 
are distinguishable by their colors, and they have different habitats, 
the one being found only on high ground, and being shy and agile, and 
the other living on low ground and climbing trees, and being sluggish 
and fearless. Stejneger believes these forms to have different distribu- 
tions; thus, the aS'. magistcr inhabits the deserts of southern California, 
Nevada, and southwestern Utah, while the ^. elarJcii inhabits south- 
eastern Arizona and an unknown distance into Mexico. Tliey occur 
together near Tuscon, Arizona. These forms do not seem to me to be 
worthy of distinction as subspecies.

Dr. Merriam, in bis report upon the results of the Death Yalley expe- 
dition, gives the habits of this sj)ecies as follows: 

The large scaly liz.ir<l known as Sceloporus darldi {magister) is a lower Souorau 
species, ranging across the southern deserts aud desert ranges of the Great Basin 
from California to Arizona and southwestern Utah. Unlike most of the lizards 
inhabiting the same region, it does not run about on the open desert, but lives on 
the tree yuccas, the ruins of stone, or adobe dwellings, the nests of wood rats, and 
other objects that afford it shelter and protection. At the mouth of Beaverdam 
Creek, in northwestern Arizona, it was common among cottonwood logs and dead 
leaves. In Pahrauagat Valley it was abundant about the ruins of stone houses and 
along the faces of cliffs. In the Mohave Desert aud other localities it is common on 
the tree yuccas, where it was often found on the very sunnuits oi the highest branches, 
and where it was rather wary and difficult of capture without a gvin. 

In California it occurs throughout the Mohave Desert, ranging as far west as the 
tree yuccas in Antelope Valley and Walker Pass, aud thence easterly in Owens Val- 
ley, Borax Flat, and the Argus aud Panamint mountains. 

In Nevada it was found on the Grapevine Mountains, in Ash Meadows, in Pah- 
rump Valley, at the foot of the Charleston Mountaius, in Vegas and Indian Springs 



CROCODILTANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 3^3 

valleys, in Pahrauajiat Mountains and Valley, at the Great IJcnil in tlie Colorado 
River, and in tho valley of the Yirt^in. 

In Arizona it was abnndant at tho point where Beaverdam Creek joins the Virgin. 

In Utah it was common in the lower Santa Clara or St. George Valley. 

Sceloimrus darkil {ma<jister) is a mixed feeder, both insects and flowers being found 
in the stomach examined. At the Great Bend of the Colorado, Nevada, and at St. 
George, Utah, stomachs were opened that contained insects only. One from the 
latter locality contained a large goldsmith beetle. 

Mr. J. Van Denburgh describes some Scelopori from Lower California 
as a distinct species under the name of *S'. licldi. The figures lie gives 
represent a smaller form than the true S. elarlcii, and one that is differ- 
ently colored. Study of both the plates and description however fails 
to reveal any other character by which it differs from that species. I 
therefore for the present regard it as a local race. I append Mr. Van 
Denburgh's description : 

The head is considerably depressed, with rounded snout. There are two scales on 
the canthus rostralis. The nostrils are large, almost superior, and nearer to the end 
of the snout than to the orbit. The ear opening is very large, almost vertical, and 
with a strong anterior denticulation of six pointed scales. The head shields are 
smooth and somewhat convex. The supraoculars are very broad. The superciliaries 
are very long, narrow, and strongly imbricate. There are two series of small, and 
one of large, sublabial plates, bordered below by the large,imbricate, bicuspid gulars. 
There is a strong fold on each side of the neck. The dorsal scales are slightly 
smaller than the caudals, strojigly keeled, very strongly mucronate, and with serrate 
edges. The lateral scales are similar to, but smaller than the dorsals, arranged in 
oblique series, and graduating into the dorsals and ventrals. The veutrals are much 
smaller than the dorsals, smooth, and bi- or tri-cuspid. The caudals are very strongly 
keeled and mucronate. The posterior surface of the thigh is covered with large, 
pointed, keeled scales. There are fifteen femoral pores. Male, with enlarged post- 
anal plates. There are thirty-three dorsal scales between the intei'parietal plate 
and tho base of tho tail. 

The back and sides are olive brown, many of the scales having central markings 
of deep blue or green. A narrow lino of verdigris green runs along each side from 
the eye to the base of the tail. IJelow this, a narrower similarly colored line runs 
from the ear to a point a short distance above and behind the axilla. A patch in 
front of the shoulder, the central part of tiie belly, and the autorior and lower sur- 
faces of the thigh are black, which color gradually fades into the cyanine blue of 
the sides of the belly. The throat is olive gray with greenish-white lines which 
converge to a point midway between the neck pouches. The tail is brown suffused 
with canii^anula bine and beryl green toward its base. 

Snout to vent, 74 mm. ; fore limb, 37 mm. ; tail, 105 mm. ; shielded part of head, 
15 mm. ; hind limb, 51 mm."; base of fifth to end of fourth toe, 22 mm. 

There is v(5ry little variation in color, either individual, sc-xual, or in accordance 
with age. One nialo from Mirallores has a single large blue ])atch on the throat, 
through which the ordinarily wliitish lines show as lines of }»aler blue. 

Tills species may be easily distiiiguislied from S. consohriini.s by its larger scales on 
the back of the thigh; from aS'. hiseriatus by its larger scales on tho border of the 
ear and the l)ack of tho thigh; from S. orcutiii by its snuiller and much rougher 
dorsals; and from S. maijister and S. costeromiis by its smaller and more sharply 
nuicronate scales. It ditfers from ail tlieso in coloration. 

IVlr. A'an Denburgh gives the following list of localities from which 
he obtained specimens of S. licldi: Sau Jose del Cabo, Lower (Cali- 
fornia: Corral de Piedras, Sierra el Taste, Lower California; Miraflores, 
Lower California; Sierra San Lazaro, Lower California.

One series of four or five, sometimes six, large transverse supraorbitals, 
with occasionally two or three smaller external ones, bordered internally | 
and externally by a row of small ones, the former completely continuous, 
occasionally a few smaller plates. Cephalic plates large, with two single ' 
verticals, scales on bade very large, and bristling, acutely pointed; 
strongly car in ated, with a i)roininent spine, but the two or three lateral

deiiti(5ulati()ns indistinct. No couspicuous ditterence in width of scales 
on back, riunp, and tail, the first mentioned much larger, their lateral 
scales about thirty-three oblique rows from head to tail, ten for cervical 
fold. Scales ou inside of tibia and behind arms obsoletely carinated. 
Free portion of hind toe as long as, or eveii longer, than cephalic plates. 
Femoral pores about thirteen. 

Color above greenish-yellow, with a series of dark transverse dorsal 
bands, not interrupted centrally on five rows of scales, a faint light 
lateral stripe beneath which are a few dusky blotches. Male with very 
little blue on the chin and sides of belly and a longitudinal blackish 
patch in point of shoulder. 

The body of this species is stout, tapering from the middle to the 
head, which is scarcely as broad as, or not broader than, the neck. Inner 
orbital plates completely cutting off" the large, supraorbital plates from 
those along the middle line of the head; sometimes there is an irregular 
indication of a smaller external series in a few plates. The cephalic 
plates are arranged as follows, beginning with the occipital: 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 
o, Avith perhai)S three more to the plates surrounding the nostrils, these 
exclusive of the plates along the lateral ridge of the head. The lateral 
occipital plates are nearly as large as the median, Avhich is nearly or 
quite in contact with that of the third series, separating the two of the 
second row. The plates of the sixth series are large and nearly equal. 
In one specimen (Cat. No. 2901?;) there is a third or median small plate 
in the second and fifth series. 

Scales not quite so erect on the tail as in some other species. Dorsal 
scales acute, broader than long. Those below are angular, but denticu- 
lated and smooth. The number of rows can not be readily made out, 
but there appear to be about forty around the body in the thickest part. 
There are, however, but tive rows on the middle of back, in a space the 
breadth of the head. 

The ground color of this species is a dull, light, olivaceous green 
(sometimes yellow). On the middle of the dorsal surface is a series of 
transverse bars, eight or nine in number, from head to above arms, and 
continued on the tail. These are sometimes shar[)ly defined and black, 
sometimes obsolete, and occupy five roM's of scales, covering only the 
inner half of the outer of these. On each side of these blotches is a clear, 
light stripe about oiui row and two half rows wide, best defined above 
the fore legs, where the light stripe is succeeded by a dusky longitudi- 
nal one, which in the males is sometimes strongly defined. Posterior 
to this the dorsal blotches are continued obsoletely and narrowly across 
on the sides. There is a black patch across the insertion of the fore leg 
in the male. The legs are barred transversely with yellowish and dusky, 
and in addition have various longitudinal lines of dusky on the outer 
surface, especially on humerus and tibia. The scales beneath, too, 
often show short (sometimes lengthened) longitudinal, well-defined 
blackish lines, the ground color being greenish-yellow or yellowish.

each scale ofteu with a central line of lighter. There appears to be no 
blue on the chin, and that on the flanks is very faintly defined. There 
is not the slightest trace of a cervical collar, although sometimes a 
black patch on the shoulder. 

Sometimes the dorsal bands are quite close together, with but little 
lighter interval. In Cat. No. 2935 the sides, between tbe fore and hind 
legs, are blue, changing to blackish internally, where there is a light 
interval of about six rows of scales. The color does not reach the groin. 

This species has somewhat the appearance of Sceloporus clarMi, but

is readily distinguishable. The large supraorbitals are bounded com- 
pletely internally by a row of small plates, cutting them off from con- 
tact with tbe first two series, as in clarlcii. The scales on the bade are 
very much larger, and are disproportionately larger than those below. 
The coloration is entirely different. There is no blotch or interrupted 
collar on the side of the neck nor blue on the chin; the bauds of tbe 
back are more transverse and continuous over five rows of scales, instead 
of being each in ten blotches. In high-plumaged males there is a black 
longitudinal patcli extending from the insertion of the arm to the bare 
space under the lateral fold, scarcely united to the blackish band

immediately above the arm. This sometimes has a few bhio scales 
anterior to it, but there are none on the chiu. The aS'. s2nnostis grows 
to twice the bulk of the S. nndulatus, which is its nearest ally in the 
genus. 

Dr. Stejneger ' thiuks that the form above described is not the true 
S. spinosus Wieginann, which, he says, has fewer femoral pores and is 
an inhabitant of Mexico. I have not been able to detect any such dif- 
ference in the specimens at my disposal. 

Sceloporu.s sjnnosus y^'iegninjui is abundant in southwestern and west- 
ern Texas, as far north as the heads of the Medina and Guadalupe. I 
did not see it on the Llano. There are specimens in Mr. Boll's Dallas 
collections, but this gentleman informs me that it is very rare so far east. 
It ranges in north Texas chiefly west of Fort Worth. This lizard is 
especially arboreal, always ascending the trunks of trees when pur- 
sued. In this situation its somber colors afford it concealment. These 
are of different shades of brown without the brilliant blue and other 
colors of the two species of the genus already named. The range of 
this species extends as far east as Pensacola, Florida, whence Baird 
obtained the type of his 8. floridanns.

Cephalic plates smooth or longitudinally rugose, especially ante- 
riorly, and laterally. Supraorbital region with one crescentic series of 
five or six large, transverse plates, embracing a short series of three or 
four additional outer and inner series of small plates in its concavity. 
Two frontal plates, one before the other, the anterior undivided, usually 
with a third anterior and adjacent one so arranged as to be surrounded 
by four plates." Free part of longest hind toe equal to the length of 
cephalic jdates. Scales of back and rump about eijual, smaller than 
those near base of tail. Lateral scales smaller than dorsal. Dorsal 
scales angular i^ointed, well carinated, with conspicuous spines, and the 
lateral denticulations indistinct. The belly scales smooth and strongly 
emarginated. The scales or inside of tibia distally and behind anus 
decidedly carinated. Femoral pores about fourteen. There are about 
forty-one oblicjue rows of scales from head to tail, about twenty-three 
from cervical fold. 

Color above, brownish olive to green. An indistinct or obsolete light

SCELOPOKUS UNDULATUS UNDULATUS Latreille. 

Sceloporus undulatus undulatns Cope, Check List Batr. Rept. N. Amer., 1875, p. 48. 
Sceloporus undulatm Baird, LT. S. Pacific R. R. Reports, X; Whipple's Report, 
Reptiles, p. 37. 

This species is of rather small size, plates on the anterior portion of 
head above, with a teudeucy to being rugose carinate, the more i)oste- 
rior with a slight trace of the same. Smaller supraocular scales sqami- 
form or imbricate and carinate. The neck is constricted and nar- 
rower than the head. The plates of tlie head exhibit a considerable 
amount of variation, so that it is difficult to say what is the true for- 
mula of arrangement. There is, however, always a complete line of 
small scales along the inner edge of the supraorbital space separating 
the larger plates from those along the central line of the head. The 
most common plan, beginning with the parietals, is 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3. The 
middle parietal is considerably larger than the lateral, and is generally 
separated from the third single plate by the two of the second series. 
(Sometimes each of the latter is divided into two, one before the other, 
the anterior pair in contact, the posterior separated by the middle occi- 
pital. The fifth series of the plates has frequently (perhaps almost 
always) a third median, much smaller one. The sixth series sometimes 
has five plates transversely, exclusive of those on the lateral edge of 
the head. Anterior to the sixth series is another of three, five, or 
more small plates, separating it from those around the nostrils. 

It is difficult to determine the number of scales encircling the body, 
owing to the obliquity of the rows on the sides, those on the back and 
belly being longitudinal. There are, as nearly as can be ascertained, 
about forty-four series, and about forty along the back from occiput to 
above anus. The scales on the back are all acute, and strongly cari- 
natedaud spinous behind, with one or two rather obsolete den ticulations 
on each side. As usual, the belly scales, though denticulate, are smooth. 
There are about seven scales from the orbit to the ear. There are about 
thirteen well-defined femoral pores. The feet appear to be lengthened; 
the free part of longest hind toe equal to the head to end of occipitals. 

This species is of a brownish olive or gray above. There is a central 
dorsal i^ortion covering about ten dorsal rows, margined by a line of 
still lighter. On each side of the back, from head to anus, are eight or 
ten narrow, rather undulating V-shaped dark angular bands, the angle 
anterior and situated in the edge of this light dorsal portion. The 
inner legs of these angles sometimes nearly meet on the back, forming 
undulating Vs with the angle behind. The space on the back, imme- 
diately behind the dark bands, is generally lighter than the ground 
color, especially in the light lateral stripe. In the female the outer legs 
of the lateral V-marks are pretty distinctly visible. In the male they 
are generally (not always) obliterated by a nearly continuous dusky 
band, Avhich extends from the black in front of the shoulder to the 
groin; the axilla, however, uucolored, as also a narrow lateral line from 



CROCODILIANiS, LIZARDS, AND f?NAKES. 371 

it to the insertiou of the hind leg. The male also has the eutire under 
surface of the head black, with a large blue patch behind. The throat 
and sides of neck, from the lateral fold to and along the anterior face 
of the arm, are black. There is a large blue patch on each side of the 
belly from (but not in) the axilla? to the groin. This is black internally, 
where the shape is elliptical, the two of opposite sides separated when 
nearest by about two scales. In the groin the color is chiefly black, 
and this sometimes covers the whole anterior surface of the thigh and 
the preanal region. The black along the belly is sometimes confluent 
with that anterior to the arm, but there is usually an interruption con- 
necting the grayish of the thoracic region with that of the inner surface 
of the arm, and i)rodu(dug a distinct cross. The scales on the under 
surface, where not colored as described, are white, finely punctate with 
black, producing a grayish appearance. This mottling is sometimes 
aggregated into distinct short lines, most conspicuous in the female. 
The head has some transverse dark lines above. 

In the female the sides sometimes appear spotted with whitish, from the 
tips, single scales being of this color. There is occasionally a trace of blue 
on the chin and sides, and generally of black at the insertion of the arm. 

The shade of coloration varies considerably, l)eing sometimes so dark 
as entirely to obscure the markings. The tip of the chin in the ntale 
is sometimes greenish white when not very highly colored; in fact, this 
is most generally the case. 

Many specimens exhibit a series of dusky lines about the»head, among 
them two or three crossing the upper part, the median one opposite the 
center of the eyes. There are also usually two lines backward from the 
posterior canthus, one directed toward the occiput, the other crossing 
the upper end of the car and confluent with the dusky of the sides. 

Professor Baird distinguished the Pacific slope representatives of 
this species as a species under the name of S. oecidentalis Baird. He 
states the difference from Eastern specimens to be as follows: 

The first positive difference is seeu in the greater roughness of the dorsal and lat- 
eral scales, owing to the greater prominence of the keels of each scale. Each scale 
is more elongated and pointed owing to the greater prominence and haikward exten- 
sion of the mncro, and the edges on each side the spine have two distinct serrations 
instead of scarcely any. On the other hand, however, the belly scales are many 
entirely without notch, and this where present is always very slight or obsolete, 
while in undulatus one or more are seen distinct and angular in every scale; a dif- 
ference which appears to be constant consists in the entire smoothness of the scales 
on the inner or under surface of the tibial joint, and those on the under surface of 
the tail for a distance behind the anus nearly equal to the length of the head. The 
posterior edge of these scales is angular or truncate, without any mucro, and with 
or without a median notch. In S. undulatus the scales on the under side of the tibia 
are all distinctly carinated, mucronated, and with lateral notches, those behind the 
anus being similarly constituted except one or two first rows. The plates under 
the cliiii are decidedly smaller and more numeroiis. Those on the back appear 
smaller likewise. 

The colors are so very similar that with the materials before nie I can scarcely 
indicate any constant difference. The colors appear rather darker, and the legs of

the V-shaped marks are more thickened except at the extreme angle, so as to have 
somewhat the appearance of being broken np into two series of blotches on each side, 
the upper leg of the V separated from the lower by the light line and thickened 
so as to appear somewhat triangular. 

I do uot find the characters above mentioned to be sufficiently con- 
stant to warrant the recognition of these Pacific forms as either species 
or subspecies, although I formerly' recognized them as Sceloporus

undulatus thayerii, a name which is i^roperly applicable to a Texan 
form. 

Professor Baird also di.stinguished a long-legged race from southern 
California under the specific name of S. longipes Baird. I do not find 
this character constant enough to warrant such recognition. Professor 
Baird describes it as follows : 

Hind foot and fore leg from elbow contained about two and a half times in the 
total length of head and body, the entire hind leg longer than the body alone, and

extondetl forward, reaching almost or quite to the eye. Free portion of longest toe 
longer than the cephalic plates. Tail one and a half times the head and body. 
Femoral pores very distinct and large. Scales on inside of femur and on helly 
smooth. General characters of form and coloration as in S. undnlatns. 

The general characters of this forEi are much as ascribed in S. occi- 
dentalism the most striking difference consisting in the much longer 
limbs, appreciable on the sliglitest comparison. It attains a considera- 
bly larger size, and the coloration is more vivid beneath, the blue of 
chin and sides more extended. The femoral pores are much more con- 
spicuous. Its range is different, being confined to southern California 
or to tlie inountaiuous interior, while the otlier belongs to the northern 
coast region and to Oregon and Washington. 

A form from Arizona is described by Stejueger, under the name 8. 
elonyatus, as having very elongate hind legs and tail. The hind leg 
measures 52 mm., while the body measures GO mm. The leg is therefore 
not so long as in the longipes form. It does not differ otherwise from 
the S. undulatuH. 

The Scehporiis undulatus, or " Fence lizard," as it is commonly called, 
is abundant in dry and wild regions iu the Alleghenian and Carolinian 
districts of the Eastern region, It is usually seen running on fences, 
logs, or trunks of trees with great activity, alternating with periods of 
watching of the iutruder on his haunts. It is very expert in dodging 
round the bodies on which it rests, defying for a long time attempts 
to capture it. 

Prof. O. P. Hay' writes as follows about the habits of this species: 

These little animals are extremely active, and thej- are able to run with great 
swiftness. Holbrook says that they are often found under the bark of decaying 
trees. It chooses also old fences as its basking places. It is given to climbing trees 
in search of insects and for safety from ])ursuers. De Kay states that when irritated 
in confinement they elevate their spinous scales in such a manner as to present a 
very formidable appearance. They are perfectly harmless, although they are often 
regarded as venomous. De Kay further states that they are able to alter their colors, 
the back assuming an azure tint. 

The eggs are said to ho laid in the sand, probably in little groups. They are 
deposited about .June 1, and are hatched about July 10. The eggs are long and nar- 
row, are covered with a tough coat, and are without any calcareous material. The 
eggs weighs about 20 grains. They are abandoned to their fate, but when the 
young are Iiatched they are treated with the utmost gentleness by all the adult.s.

SCELOPORUS UNDULATUS TRISTICHUS Cope. 

Sceloporus tristichus Copk, Report U. S. Expl. Surv. W. lOOtli Mer., Zoology, V, 
1875, p. 571. 

Scales of the liead smootli ; supraorbitals in only three rows ; a median 
series of transverse plates bounded by a roM^ of small ones internally 

and externally; frontal di- 
vided transversely; interpa- 
rietal wide as long; parietals 
undivided ; scales in forty 
rows from head to base of 
tail, well keeled and strongly 
raucronate, a little larger than 
its lateral, which about equal 
the ventral ; four preauricular 
free scales; a granular patch 
behind lateral fold of neck; 
when the short hind legs are 
extended forward, the end of 
the external toe reaches the 
axilla and the longest toe 
reaches the prehumeral 
pocket; femoral pores, six- 
teen. Color light olive-brown, 
with a pale lateral band on 
each side, separated by seven 
rows of scales. This dorsal 
space is crossed by undulat- 
ing, narrow, black cross bands, 
which are interrupted in the middle and pale-bordered behind ; a brown 
baud from the eye to the middle of the side, where it is broken into 
spots; legs and feet black-speckled; some black longitudinal lines on 
posterior face of thigh; blue of the sides well separated below; a sub-

round bhickisb-blue spot on each side the throat. This subspecies is 
about the size of the S. u. consobrinus, but it rather resembles in color 
the >S'. u. undulatns. It has only one occipital plate on each side, and the 
arrangement of the supraocular plates is unlike that of any other sj^ecies. 
Posteriorly the large transverse supraoculars are only separated from 
the superciliaries by a single series of lanceolate scales like the super- 
ciliaries. For their anterior half they are separated from this lanceo- 
late series by two or three wider scales, forming a single row. There 
are two to three rows of rounded scales in the same position in the *S^. u. 
vndiilattis and S. u. consobriuKS. In the former subspecies from both 
coasts there are two rows of scales between the suborbital plate and 
the suj)erior labials. In the 8. u. tristichus there is only one such row, 
which consists of lanceolate scales. Thus this form ditfers from the S. 
tmdulafvs in a direction the opposite of the S. Mseriatiis. 

As to colorations, there are eight cross bands between the groin and 
axilla, while in the 8. u. undulatus from both coasts there are five or six. 

Measurements. — Total length, 132 mm.; length to vent, 59 ram.; 
length to axilla (axial), 27 mm.; length to ear (a"ial), 14 mm.; length 
of fore leg, 24 mm.; length of fore foot, 11 mm.; length of hind leg, 
37 mm. ; length of hind foot, 18 mm. 

This form diilers considerably in appearance from the 8. undulatus, 
but as it is represented by but one specimen it may turn out to be a 
variety of that widely distributed species.

central single plates, with a third more anterior, surrounded by five 
others, tlie plates all smooth. Occipital large, with two or three plates

denticulatious, the belly scales decidedly notched. Scales in inside of 
femur and behind anus smooth. There are about forty-one oblique 
series from head to above anus; about thirty from the lateral cervical 
folds. 

General color above, yellowish olive, with two well-defined narrow 
lines separated by about eight scales, and a broad median dorsal stripe 
of the ground color. Between each lateral and the dorsal stripe is a 
series of well-marked oblique short lines about two scales wide. A

dusky lateral stripe, with a yellowish one below it; a short horizcHital 
line on tbe shoulder ; beneath yellowish ; tail without bands ; sometimes 
a row of dusky blotches above. Male with two confluent bluish spots 
on each side tbe chin. Side of belly bluish ; cephalic plates somewhat 
as in ;S'. thayeri. 

The prevailing color of this species is an olivaceous yellow, seldom 
greenish. On each side are two unusually well-defined stripes of clear 
yellow, the upper especially, which begins a little above the lateral

fold aud runs back to the tail, which api^ears entirely without adjacent 
bars. It occupies a width of two half scales, the innermost of opposite 
sides separated on the back by a width of six scales (sometimes seven!), 
the outermost separated by about three rows from the lower lateral 
stripe, which is bordered below by dusky, the under parts being yel- 
lowish. Between the lateral light lines is a dusky stripe, quite dark in 
adult males, though spotted with yellowish and really commencing 
behind the eye as a narrow line. Along the central line of the back is 
a broad stripe of the ground color, without blotches, and four rows of 
scales wide, and the interval between this space and the lateral stripes 
(one and two half scales) is crossed obliquely by a succession of about 
ten oblique dusky bars, from head to above anus. These bars are 
really the thickened inner legs of V-shaped marks, the outer legs in the 
dusky lateral stripe, but more or less obscured there, and sometimes 
quite indistinct on the back. In the male there is a dull patch of bluish 
on each side of the belly, but no black border. The dusky stripe below 
the lower lateral line, however, runs on to the anterior face of the thigh. 
The blue patches are separated on the belly by a wide interval. There 
is a blue patch, sometimes confluent and suffused with black, on each 
side of the chin. There is a short blackish line from the lateral fold to 
the shoulder, and several transverse ones across the top of head. 

The general impression of color at a distance is that of a yellow-olive 
sheen, with two lateral yellowish stripes and three dusky ones (the 
upper a series of blotches), with a broad uncolored stripe down the mid- 
dle of the back. There is no tendency to a meeting of the dorsal 
blotches, nor are there any bands on the tail. 

This form appears to me to be rather a race of the S. tindulatus than 
a distinct species. I at one time supposed it to be characterized by the 
presence of two parietal plates on each side, but I lind, on examining 
larger material, that this character is entirely exceptional. In fact, there 
is iio material difference in the i>lates of the head between this species 
and undulatns, except that they are smoother. The scales of the hind 
leg and undersurface of tail are, however, much smoother. The most 
appreciable difference is in color, the latter never having the sharply 
defined yellow lines on each side, nor the broad nnblotched stripe on 
the back. The tail of eonsobrinus also is always without blotches, except 
occasionally on the median line. The blue marks on the belly and chin 
are less intense. 

The smoothness of the scales ou the inside of the hind leg must be 
relied on in many cases to distinguish the species from S. thaycri (of 
much the same size) when the lateral markings are obscure. Even in 
this case, however, the light dorsal interval will generally be found 
well defined, and the tail without lateral, if any, blotches. 

Specimens from the Upper Colorado region, Cat. Nos. 4360-4362, differ 
in some respects from the type, with an approximation to S. iindKlatus. 

This lizard is found all over Texas and is very variable in its charac-

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



ters. It always lias about tweuty-eight transverse series of keeled uni- 
mucronate scales between the interscapula and interfemoral regions, and 
tlie lateral scales are not larger than the ventral. The head scales are 
smooth. There may be three or two rows of supraorbitals between the 
internal and superciliary scales. The colors are often brilliant, especially 
n specimens from near San Antonio, where the sides of the neck and 
head are often of a bright rufous and the tail reddish and yellowish- 
brown at the base. It is very abundant from Dallas west to Fort 
Concho, and southwest to San Antonio, and in the iirst plateau region 
to the head of the Medina River. It is found on the ground, but 
always takes refuge in trees, running on and around the limbs with 
great agility. 

According to Stejneger' this species is common in the cedar belt of 
the San Francisco Mountain plateau in Arizona.

Supraorbitals in oue series of five large transverse plates, margined 
internally by one series and externally by two of smaller hexagonal 
ones within the superciliaries. Cephalic plates hirge, regular, smooth. 
Free portion of longe.st hind toe equal to the length of cephalic plates 
above. Xo decided difference in breadth of scales on back, rump, or 
tail above; the first, however, decidedly larger than those on sides. 
Dorsal scales angular, but the edges rather rounded, with moderate 
carination, very slight spine, and almost no lateral denticulation; the 
belly scales scarcely or not at all notched. Scales on inside of tibia 
smooth, without mucro. Femoral pores 14-16. About tifty oblique 
series of dorsal scales ; thirty-five firm gular fold. Femoral pores about 
twenty. 

Above olivaceous gray (green to blue in life), with the dorsal series 
of rounded blotches, bordered behind with lighter gray. No cervical 
collar, but one or two small spots on shoulder. Chin and sides of male 
faintly blue. 

Head large and broad. Plates 3 (occipital), 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, and 4 to 
the four interuasals. Lateral parietals large. External two rows of 
supraoculars fiat and smooth, hexagonal, and truncate posteriorly. 
Only one row external to the last one or two large supraoculars. Five 
acuminate free scales bounding auricular meatus in front. 

The scales are small, there being but about fifty oblique series from

head above to tail, and about sixty-five around the body. They become 
smaller from the back to the sides, where they scarcely if at all exceed 
the belly scales. Abdominal and gular scales slightly notched at apex. 
The extended hind leg reaches to the orbit. 

The ground color of this species above is a light olivaceous-gray with 
ten dorsal series of about ten round blotches, bordered behind by a 
lighter shade of the ground color. These blotches are three or four 
scales wide. There are faint indications of a lateral series of the same 
spots, but without any intervening light line. The hinder part of the 
thigh shows two blackish lines. There is a small blackish spot on the 
shoulder and another above it, but no indication of a collar. This

region and that of the groin show a few light yellowish spots. The 
sides of the belly and the under surface of the head are blue, the latter 
with the blue posterior, and anteriorly with a median light line and 
scattered spots. In old males the throat, middle of belly, and inferior 
side of femur may be black. 

This species is quite well marked, and is not likely to be confounded 
with any others from the West, excepting, perhaps, 8. undulatns. In 
this it differs in the larger size and the smoother and smaller scales, as 
well as in the plates of head, and the hexagonal shape and SDioothness 
of the smaller supraoculars. Its limbs are longer, greatly exceeding in 
this respect S. undiilatus.

This is the Great Basin species of the iS. undulatus oToiip, ranging- as 
far southeast as San J>ernar(lino, California. It is the handsomest of 
them, but displays great variety in the coloration, which, however, 
always displays green on the upper surfaces, and freijuently blue. I 
have taken it in the San Francisco Mountains, southwestern Utah, and 
Summer Lake, Oregon, which is the most northern locality known to 
me. In the .specimen from the latter locality there is a row of turcinoise 
blue spots on each side of the back. 

In regard to the distribution of this si)ecies, Br. Merriam, in the 
report on the results of the Death Valley expedition, remarks as fol- 
lows : 

Sceloporus hiseriatns is ouc of the few lizards inhabitinif both the desert ranges of 
the Great Basin and the interior valley of California. Specimens were obtained at 
frequent intervals all the way from the Upper San Joaquin Valley, in California, to 
the Upper Santa Clara Valley, in Utah, about 10 miles northwest of St. George. On 
the east side of the Great Divide, in California, it was obtained on the Panamint, 
Argus, Coso, White, and Inyo mountains, and at the east foot of the Sierra, in 
Owens Valley (on Independence; Creek). On the west side of the Great Divide it 
was common on the west slope of Walker Pass, and thence down into Kern Valley 
to the neighborhood of Kernville, and southerly along the west slope of the Sierra 
to Havilah and Walker Basin, and northerly to Three Rivers. It was common also 
in the Canada de las Uvas and in the Upper San Joaquin A^ alley, where specimens 
were collected on the Charleston Mountains (near Mountain Spring), on Mount 
Magruder, in the Juniper Mountains, and in the Grapevine Mountains. 

A black form (having the belly intensely blue-black) was found on black lava rock 
in Diamond Valley, Utah; on the Charleston Mountains (near Mountain Spring), 
Nevada, where if was found both on rocks and on juniper trees, and on the White 
Mountain.s, near the eastern boundary of California. In the latter locality it was. 
common on the summit of the Divide, near the road between Deej) Spring and Owens 
valleys, where it was Irequently seen on and among light-colored rocks, which made 
it unusually conspicuous. It is entirely possible, however, that this very striking 
contrast is a protection, causing the lizard to resemble the dark cracks in the rocks 
when viewed from' above by passing hawks.

side of the back, separated by six or .seven scales only; between these 
two series of dark blotches. I\lale with a continuous, well-marked black 
stripe on the sides, from above the arm, and a blue patch on each s^ide

posterior half of chin, sometimes (not always) confluent internally, each 
one with another always distinct one of blue. 

Tiiis species has a close resembhviice to S. undKlatus, and sometimes 
is distinguished with great diiliculty. The interparietal is larger, the 
parietals smaller, and two on each side instead of one. The scales are 
more strongly cariimted. The light stripes on each side the back are 
near together, being separated by an interval of only six or eight scales 
instead of ten. The black lateral stripe is much more distinct. There 
is a greatei- interval between the blue patches on the belly. The blue

ou tlie cliiii is in two patches instead- of one, as is more generally the 
case (though not always) in undulatus. The size appears considerably 
less. The dorsal markings are more in the shape of triangular blotches, 
as in the form 8. occidentidh, than in nndulatiug narrow lines. 

The lack of distinct yellow lines and the presence of the lateral 
black stripe, with the carination of inferior tibial and postanal scales, 
will distinguish it from S. u. consohrinm. This form is, so far as known, 
restricted to southwestern Texas. It is peculiar in the genus in the 
carination and acumination of the ventral scales, and in the same 
character of the scales on the inferior surface of the tibia. The 
scales external to the largo series of supraoculars are less numerous 
than the species of this section, approaching very nearly to the type 

of 8. iristichus.

Supraorbital region with a large crescent of transverse plates (much 
broken anteriorly) with a second smaller in its convexity. Two more 
external rows and an internal, making five in all. Cephalic i^lates 
smooth. Two middle verticals. Occipitals with a row of small, smooth 
plates behind. Free portion of hind toe reaching to middle of occipital. 
Dorsal and lateral scales equal, acute, rather spinous; about fifty rows 
of scales from head to tail. Femoral pores about fifteen. 

Olive gray with two light lines on each side; scales wide, not mar-

gated blackish crescents on each side the back. A vertical black 
line from dusky lateral bar on neck to shoulder, with a whitish one 
behind it. A bluish spot above insertion of arms. Two black lines 
ou posterior face of tibia. Chin in male marbled w^ith blue; sides with 
a blue patch separated below by seven or eight rows of scales. 

Lateral gular flap very small, almost wanting; only indicated by the

small size of scales in the subjacent cavity. Occipital plate very large, 
subtriangular or pentagonal, broader than long, with three lateral 
plates, all quite small. The series of cephalic plates is occipital, 1, 1, 2, 3, 
and two or three smaller series to the nostrils. All are perfectly 
smooth. The supraorbital region shows one interuiil series of small 
I)lates, then a series of six or seven moderately broad ones, then two 
rather confused smaller series within the angular plates at the extreme 
outer edge. 

The scales on the body are all small, there being, as far as can be 
ascertained, about fifty encircling the body at the thickest part. In a 
male about fifteen rows nuiy be counted in the middle of the back in a 
space equal to the head in width; in a distended female only eleven. 
The scales on the tail are wider than those on the back. The scales

on the back are but little wider than those on the belly, certainly not 
one and a half times as wide. They are acute, conspicuously keeled, 
and mucronate behind, but with only slight indication of lateral notches, 
and that only close to the median point. The belly scales are very 
rarely notched, generally angular, but sometimes a little truncate. 
Those on the inside of the tibia and between the anal region are 
smooth. There are about fifteen femoral pores. 

The ground color of this species is brownish; olivaceous above, with 
two conspicuous yellowish stripes on each side, the two inclosing a 
rather darker stripe, and the lower with a narrow interrupted dusky 
line below- it. On each side are two series of U-shaped or crescentic 
dusky blotches, one between the light stripes, tlie other above the 
upper one. They are separated on the back by a plain grayish line, 
equal to the width of two (sometimes three) scales. They really begin

at the head as vstripes, one behind the middle of the eye, the other in a 
line with the suborbital plates, but above the shoulder they break up into 
the crescentic blotches, of which there are nine or ten, to above anus. 
These blotches are formed by a U of black, the convexity behind, and 
the legs filled up by darker olive than elsewhere. They are bordered 
behind by narrow yellowish crescents, running into the lateral stripes. 
There is around black spot immediately above the insertion of the arm 
on a line with the lowermost dark stripe, and a short perpendicular bar 
from the median dusky stripe on the neck to the shoulder; in the male 
running along the anterior face of the arm, but always separated from 
the black spot mentioned. There are two well-defined black lines on 
the posterior face of the thigh. The legs are barred with dusky, each 
bar bordered behind by yellowish. The under parts are yellowish 
white, the chin coarsely marbled or reticulated with bluish, sometimes 
greenish white. The tail is decidedly banded and blotched. 

The male has an oblong blue patch on each side tlie belly, extending 
from (but not in) axilla to groin. The median light interspace is linear 
and about six scales wide. The upper series of blotches is contained in 
a width of about two and two half scales; the upper light line is about 
one and two half scales. 

In some larger si)ecimens from the upper Missouri (Cat. No. -888) the 
dark crescents are more obsolete, and the blue on the side of belly is 
much darker internally, almost black, but does not extend on the anterior 
face of the thigh. In one specimen only, which appears to be very old 
and highly colored (Cat. No. 2842), the whole under surface of the femur 
•is blackish, this color extending forward from the inner edge of the blue 
ventral blotches to the breast, separated there by a narrow light space 
from a blackish band across the throat. The space in front of the 
shoulder is black, with a white spot. The under surface of the head is 
blue, speckled with whitish, and faintly blotched with black. 

The typical specimens of S. gracilis (Cat. No. 3063), from Oregon, I 
can not distinguish from those of S. graciosus except by the more obso- 
lete nature of the markings. They appear rather more slender, but 
this may be owing to having been preserved in too strong alcohol. A 
specimen from upper Pitt River (Cat. No. 2832) appears precisely like 
Cat. No. 2888 fromuj^per Missouri; like them, having the blotches less 
distinct than in the type specimens. » 

This species, though quite similar to 8. scalar is of Wiegmann, is 
readily distinguished, with other features, by the smoothness of the 
cephalic plates, and by the definite direction of the scales of the sides 
of the body. 

This is a pretty species, which is especially abundant in the Great 
Basin region. The most northern locality of its range with which I am 
acquainted is Summer Lake, Oregon, where I caught specimens. Stej- 
neger records it from the Painted Desert, Arizona, I have observed a 
slight variety of it from near the city of Jalapa, Mexico, in the collec- 
tion of the Comision Geographica et Exploiadora of Mexico,

The followin*^ account of the liabits of Siwlo^Mrus {/raciosns is given 
by Dr. Merriaui in his report upon the results of the Death Valley 
expedition : 

This species, wliicli is ;i characteristic iulial)itaut of the Upper Soiioraii aud transi- 
tion zones in northern Nevada, eastern Orej^on, and. Idaho, was very abundant on the- 
sage-covered plateau of Mount JIagnuler at an altitude of 2,450 meters (8,000 feet); 
in the sage ])lains on top of the White and Inyo mountains near the boundary between 
California and Nevada; and on the east slope of the Sierra Nevada west of Owens 
Valley (at 2, 150 meters, or 8,000 feet). It was common also among the sage and juni- 
per on the Juniper Mountains, along the boundary between Nevada and Utah. 

Sccloponin f/raciosus is geuerallj' found in company with such Transition zone spe- 
cies as the sage thrasher (fh-oscopfes moiitaniis), Brewer's sparrow (Sjnsclla breicerii), 
the Nevada sage sparrow {Amph'ispiza helli neradcnsis), the sage-plains chipmunk

SCELOPORUS VANDENBURGIANUS Cope. 
Sceloporus vandenhurgiamis Cope, Americiiu Naturalist, XXX, 1896, p. 834. 

This is a small species with small scales and very dark colors. There 
is not much difference in the sizes of the dorsal, lateral, and ventral 
scales. Forty-five rows may be counted between the occiput and a line 
connecting the groins, and twelve in a head length. Between the groin 
and axilla thirty-five scales may be counted to an axillary area of smaller 
and smooth scales. The dorsal and lateral scales are keeled and mucro- 
nate; those of the inferior surfaces smooth and mostly feebly notched. 
Caudal scales strongly keeled and mucronate, and larger than dorsals. 
Two parietals on each side, the anterior the larger, and extending to 
the narrow marginal supraocular row, so that there is only one frouto-

parietal on each side. A third parietal external to the other two. The 
frontal is not longitndinally divided. There is one series of six large 
supraoculars, separated from the frontals and frontoparietals all round 
by a series of small scales. External to the large supraoculars is a 
series of four much smaller ])olygonal flat scales much as in S. hiseriatus. 
Between these and the superciliaries is one row of still smaller scales 
(with an extra scale or two). Two scales on the canthus rostralis. 
Head scales all smooth. Six large free auricular scales. A single ver- 
tical prehumeral fold, inclosing a pocket of granular scales. Temporal 
scales keeled. 

The extended hind leg reaches to the auricular meatus. Femoral 
pores 16. Male with postanal plates. 

Color of adult male dark-green above, with faint traces of a paler 
strii)e on each side of the back and of a few darker spots on each side 
of the middle line. Inferior surfaces dark blue, with a pale line in the

I have seen of this species only one specimen, which is an adult male. 
The colors of the female may be expected to be somewhat lighter. I 
have dedicated it to Mr. John Vau Denburgh, of San Francisco, au 
able writer on herpetological subjects.

A small species with an arched profile. Supracephalic plates keeled, 
arranged as in S. scalaris, each canlhus rostralis having two roof- 
shaped scutes; supraocular scales subhexagoual, in three rows, those 
of the internal row scarcely wider than long. The two froutals creased 
with a furrow; the i)osterior, nearly as large as the anterior, is articu- 
lated behind, along the shorter side, with the occipital i)late. The 
latter, as wide as it is long, narrow in front, is bordered right and left 
by one or two frontoparietals and one parietal scute; behind, its outline 
is subround, showing in the middle a hollow in which is inclosed a small 
nuchal scale, a little larger than those on the upper part of the neck. 
Labial scales rectangular, eight above and ten below ; above the upper 
ones there are two longitudinal series of lengthened scales. Anterior 
border of the ear bordered with scutella smaller than those which pre- 
cede them. Dorsal scales not notched, rhomboidal, strongly keeled, 
sharply pointed, forming thirty-eight oblique series, from the nape of 
the neck to the posterior borderof the thighs, eight longitudinal to the 
level of the shoulders, and twelve in the trunk region; eight of these 
scales equal the length of the top of the head; ventral scales and 
those of the sides rather small, the latter feebly notched, forming by the 
Junction of their keels longitudinal lines parallel to those on the upper 
surface of the body. Tail scales smaller than those on the body, except 



392 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, ISflS. 

at tlie base, where tlioy nre of the same dimensions. Tibia not quite so 
long- as the shielded part of the head. The femoral pores, less distinct 
in the female, number seventeen to eighteen under each thigh, and 
almost merge together at the interfemoral region. 

Measurements. — Total length of specimen, 104 mm.; length of upper 
surface of head, 9 mm.; length of head at the level of the temples, 
85 mm.; length of body from chin to anus, 44 mm.; length of tail, 
60 mm.; length of tibia, 9 mm. 

Ul^per surfaces of the body olive green, mixed with a- coppery reddish 
brown; two indistinct bands extend along each side of the body; 
between each two there are traces of black dots. Lower surfaces bright 
yellow. 

Says Bocourt: "Wiegmann's type of this species is a female of small size, resem- 
bling Sceloporus scalaris in the following particulars : (1) arrangement of siipra- 
cepbalic ])lates; (2) scales on the sides have the cariua' directed backward, forming 
bj' contact longitudinal lines jiarallel to those of the dorsal scales ; (3) femoral i)ores 
merge together in the interfemoral region. There are some details, however, of no 
great specific value, which distinguish Sceloporus aneiis from its relatives; head and 
limbs relatively short; scales of the upper jiart of the body rather large, and the 
coloration differs markedly in some respects." 

According to Duges, the Sceloporus wneus is characteristic of the 
Texcocan district of the plateau. He records it from Guanajuato, 
Silos, Tupataro, Lamora, and Chilcota.

Head shields smooth or slightly rugose, anterior frontal not divided; 
a series of feebly dilated transverse supraoculars, a series of large 
scales external to them; two canthal scales; occipital a little broader 
than long; parietals very small, usually one pair on each side; ante- 
rior border of ear leebly denticulated. Dorsal scales larger than veu- 
trals, strongly keeled, not, or but slightly, mucronate, not serrate, in 
forty-five transverse rows between interscapular and sacral regions, 
forming oblique series; forty-five to fifty scales between the occipital 
shield and the base of the tail ; twelve to fifteen scales correspond to the 
length of the shielded part of the head; lateral scales keeled, directed 
obliquely upward, gradually merging into the dorsals and ventrals; 
latter smooth, mostly entire; forty-six to fifty scales round the middle

Cephalic plates generally smooth, arrauged very nearly as they are 
8. variabilis Wiegmann. Prefrontal scales ronnded; two roof-shaped 
scales on each acanthus rostralis; occipital plate bordered posteriorly 
by a row of thick scales a little larger than those on the anterior part 
of the neck; supraoculars arranged in three longitudinal rows, some- 
times in four or five, making a region of hexagonal scales rather wider 
than long; anterior border of the auditory meatus having a serrated 
structure, formed by flat-pointed scutella, slightly larger than those 
immediately preceding; scales on the back small, rhomboidal and 
keeled, arranged in from sixty-six to seventy-nine oblique rows extend- 
ing from the luipe of the neck to a line joining the posterior borders of 
the thighs; eighteen to twenty-one of the scales equals the length of 
the upper surface of the head; ventral scales and those of the flanks a 
trifle smaller; the keels of these latter scales are directed obliquely 
upward; tail covered with scutella, strongly keeled, as large again as 
those on the back; fifteen to twenty-two pores under each thigh. 

Upper parts of the body olive green, with a very narrow collar and 
bands of striped brown, giving a mottled appearance to the flanks. 
On the lateral part of the belly the males have two longitudinal black 
bauds, very close together, bordered on the outside with blue. The 
collar region is sometimes crossed with black; throat a blue gray, 
thickly dotted with small, black spots. 

Measurements. — Total length, 140 mm.; length of head from the end 
of muzzle to the posterior border of the occipital plate, 14 mm. ; width 
of head at the temples, 15 mm.; length of trunk from chin to anus, 61 
mm.; length of tail, 79 mm.; lenth of tibia, 15 mm. 

Sceloporus microlepidotus, regarded by Wiegmann in Isis as a variety 
of 8. grammicus, ditters from it only iu having the dorsal scales smaller; 
but as these are variable in size in both cases, it is very difficult to 
distinguish always the species. 

The 8. microlepidotus is abundant on the Mexican plateau, ranging 
north to Guanajuato, where it has been taken by Dr. Dug^s.

series; dorsal scales without mucro or denticulation; belly scales entire; 
about eighty-two series of scales from head to tail. Free i)ortion of 
hind foot shorter than cephalic j)lates, in male longer than in female. 
Femoral pores about eighteen or twenty. 

Above greenish olive, irregularly varied with small dusky blotches, 
with indistinct border behind lighter than ground color. Two lateral 
stripes separated by about eighteen rows of scales. Side of neck and 
body dark indigo; an oblique whitish stripe on sides from groin; a 
perpendicular bar above the shoulder and several light blotches on 
and in front of shoulder, circumscribing a subcircular indigo patch 
with a central blotcli. Sides of jaws with blue and whitish bars 
extending round on the chin obliquely backward. Female almost 
plain greenish blue; whitish beneath. 

This species, among those with the smallest dorsal scales, is also one 
of small dimensions. The head is dei)ressed, rather pointed, but 
rounded at the tip, and the distance from snout to end of occipitals is 



396 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

If the width above. The hind feet are leugtheiied, the free i>ortion of 
longest toe being equal to or hmger than the head above. The cephalic 
plates are all perfectly smooth, the anterior ones finely punctured round 
the circumference. The frontal is longitudinally divided. The inter- 
parietal is large and subquadrate or pentagonal and pointed anteriorly. 
There are two or three parietals on each side and a pair in contact 
anterior to this, then 1, 2, 3, 3 with three others to the plates surrounding 
the nostrils Avith four suf)ranasals. The j)lates on the snout are so 
disposed anterior to the single internasal as to form a pentagon of five 
around a smaller. There are six transverse supraocular plates, with 
one internal and two external series, the latter sometimes indistinct. 

The scales on the body are all very small, at least eighty or more 
encircling the body. They are not very acute, distinctly keeled above 
and on sides, Avith moderate scarcely projecting mucro. No lateral 
denticulations can be observed; the belly scales, however, are faintly 
notched. The scales on the «ides are much smaller than those on the 
back, especially on the side of neck and above shoulders, where they 
are almost paved and tubercular, not imbricate. 

The upper parts in the male are greenish olive, mottled irregularly 
with small blackish blotches, in which no serial arrangement can be 
observed. On each side of the back is a light-greenish line, the two sep- 
arated by about eighteen rows of scales, exhibiting as many lines of 
carination nearly parallel to each other. Below this there is no distinct 
oblique serial arrangement of carinated scales, except midway between 
fore and hind legs. The sides immediately below the light stripe are 
abruptly bluish black, bordered posteriorly below by a well-defined 
white stripe passing obliquely upward and forward from the groin half 
way to the axilla, and then broken up the rest of the distance into a 
series of obsolete light mottlings and sj^ots. Below this light space is 
an indigo patch on each side of the belly, quite obsolete and indistinct 
centrally and interiorly, where there is an interval of eight or ten 
scales and no black inner margin, as in variahilis. The sides of the 
neck are deep indigo, with a distinct whitish band from the lateral 
stripe peri)endicular to the insertion of the arm. Anterior to this is 
an angular light sj)ot on the center of an indigo subcircular patch, 
bounded above and behind by the light lines mentioned, below by one 
or two yellowish spots. Anteriorly the sides of the neck are mottled 
with light spots and a yellowish horizontal line from the gape of the 
mouth. The sides of the jaws are crossed iierpendicularly by five or 
six narrow light lines, which, on the chin, pass obliquely backward, so 
as, with their fellows, to form a series of indistinct and interrupted Vs, 
the intervals being blue. On the point of the chin, however, the whit- 
ish predominates. The posterior face of the thigh (covered with paved 
scales) is indigo, with a light stripe. The legs are banded transversely 
with dusky bluish. 

This is the most highly varied of all the North American Scelopori, 



CKOCODILIANy, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES,

ami is very ditilicult to describe. It differs in coloration from its nearest 
ally, S. marmoratus, by the absence of serial arrangem<!nt of dorsal 
blotches; by the decided -shaped arrangement of the blue on the 
chin and the lines on the Jaws; the white line on the Hanks; the greater 
separation of the ])atches on the belly, and the absence of a dark 
inner border to them. The form differs very materially. 

A young specimen (Cat. No. 2731a) has a more decided serial arrange 
ment of larger and more quadrate dorsal blotches, and there is an 
indication of a dark blue patch on the throat, with a transverse whitish 
band connecting tiie yellowish i)atch on the shoulder. 

In the four female specimens before me (Cat. No. 2743) the general 
color is of a light bluish; greenish olive above, and whitish beneath. 
There is a faint trace of ten dorsal rows of small cresceutic blotches, 
and of a lateral light line, with a dusky stripe along the sides, but this 
is very indefinite. There is no decided indication of the usual blotches 
or lines about the shoulder. 

This species is readily distinguished from most of its allies with 
small scales by the smoothness of the cephalic x)lates and the marked 
inferiority in size of the lateral to the dorsal plates. Those on the side 
of the neck and body for some distance behind the slioulders are almost 
like fine tubercles, not imbricated nor carinated. 

I have referred Cat. No, 2739, males and females, to this species, 
although there is an unusual difference in color for the sexes of the same 
species and the hind toes are shorter. In coloration this is one of the 
handsomest of the genus.

• This species is of a dark olive-gieeu color, with a light greenish- white 
line on each side, separated by fourteen or fifteen rows of scales. 
Between these are two series of snbcjuadrate or dark blotches, separated 
by a faint dorsal greenish line, the blotches bordered behind by branches 
from the upper lateral stripe. Below the light lateral line is a blue-black 
stripe beginning narrowly back of the eye and widening on the sides, 
its lower edge not sharply defined. In the male there is a well-defined 
elongated black ellipse on each side the belly; those of opposite sides 
very nearly in contact and the upper i)art wanting or diflused in the 
dusky of the sides. This anteriorly runs into a large, intensely black 
l)atch in and above the axilla and extending along the posterior face of 
the arm; ^posteriorly it reaches the groin, but does not extend on the 
femur. The central portion of the ellipse is whitish, with a violet 
shade in the alcoholic si^ecimen. There is a well-defined narrow yellow 
line running perpendicularly from the lateral stripe to the insertion of 
the arm above. The under parts are whitish, irregularly dotted with 
blue-black, most so on the chin, which appears speckled with whitish. 
There is a trace of a short white line on the cheek in line with the gape 
of mouth. 

In the series before me there are no females from the same localities 
with the males. Those referred to the same si)ecies are what Dr. Hallo- 
well and Baird and Girard have called S. scalaris of Wagler. These 
are similar in general character, but lack the ventral elliptical marks 
and the distinct lateral black band. There is, however, the same short, 
light line at tlie shoulder, perpendicular to but not confluent with the 
lateral light stripe. 

It maybe proper to state that the specimen on which the description 
has been based (Cat. No. 2889) has rather a blunter snout than the 
others and the scales on the back appear rather smaller, but I can find 
no other characters of importance. 

This species ranges throughout the damjjer parts of eastern and 
southern Mexico, and in southwestern Texas as far north as the lati- 
tude of San Antonio. The locality "Salt Lake" of the Smithsonian 
record, as given below, is probably incorrect. Stejneger was the first 
to discover that this species is the iV. dclicatissimns of Hallowell; and 
both Hallowell and Baird and Girard had regarded other examples of it 
as the S. scalaris. 

The S. variabilis is i)robably named on account of the wide difierence 
in color between the males and females. It is one of the handsomest 
species of the genus.

General i^laii of supraorbitals as in 8. nndulatus, the outer central 
series of supraorbital plates small. The cephalic jjlates anteriorly and 
laterally rugose. Two internasals and four postnasals. Two frontals. 
Legs very short; proportion of longest toe about three-fourths the 
cephalic plates. Dorsal, rump, and caudal scales about equal, rather 
larger than the lateral, the former elongated, acutely pointed, with 
moderate spine, and one lateral denticulation. Inside of tibia and 
behind anus smooth. Femoral pores twelve. About forty-four oblique 
rows of scales from occiput to tail; thirty from cervical fold. 

Olive gray, with a narrow line of white on each side the back, on the 
center of a row of scales, the rest of which is black, these lines sep- 
arated by six rows of scales. Back with a central gray line. Two rows 
of elongated dusky crescents on the back, about thirteen from head to 
tail, margined behind by lighter. Two other series less distinct iu each 
side, separated by a broken light line. Two small dark spots on and 
above the shoulder. 

Cat. Xo. 2SS4. This species has rather a slender head, its length being- 
one and a half times the width. The large subcordate occipital has three 
smaller ones on each side. The cephalic plates are 7, 1, 1, 2, 3, and 4 to 
those immediately posterior to the single nasal plate, six in number. 
All are remarkably symmetrical iu arrangement. The seven occipital 
may perhaps be considered as five and two, the latter separated by 
the large occipital. The last- men tinned series of four is composed of 
two inner very large, and a lateral small. All are distinctly but mod- 
erately rugose transversely.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



The lateral gular folds are quite moderate. The scales above are 
remarkable for being louger than broad. They are thus very acute- 
angle<l, decidedly keeled, and sharp, but with little or no projecting 
niucro. They are notched on each side tiie point above, very few of 
them on the belly, more on the chin. There are about thirty-nine or 
forty scales encircling the thickest part of the body. The legs are very 
short; the hind feet only about one and one-fourth times the head from 
snout to end of occipital plates. The scales on the inside of tibia and 
behind anus are smooth. There are about fourteen femoral pores. 

The colors resemble much those of S. graciosus. The ground color 
above is olivaceous gray. There is a well defined and narrow line of

yellowish white on each side the back, beginning distinctly on llie 
temples in a line with the superciliary ridge. This occupies Ihe center 
only of a single row of scales, the outer portion of which, and to a cer- 
tain extent the inner also, is traversed by a well-marked line of black. 
These lines are separated on the back by six rows of scales. A cen- 
tral light, ashy stripe one and two half scales wide traverses the back, 
and on each side of these is a series of U shaped blotches (about fif- 
teen from head to above anus), bordered externally by the light lines. 
There is a second series of U's on the side, bounded below by a second 
interrupted yellow line on the adjacent half rows, the upper one being 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKEH^. 403 

the tbird from that travcised by the first mentioned yellow line. There 
are even obscure indications of a third lateral series of dark blotches 
below this last line. On the back, where most distinct, the U-m;irks 
(the convexity behind) have their outline black, bordered l)eliind l)y 
whitish (ou the tips of scales), the interior lilled up first by olive brown 
and then by tirayer. The lateral series are somewhat similar, the 
lower light Tine being formed by light borders to adjacent U-shaped 
blotches of the second and third series. There is a V-shaped mark on 
the occipital region, the angle anterior, and another behind the nos- 
trils, with an intervening blotch and a transverse bar on the supercili- 
ary region. There is a short line above the insertion of the arm and 
another on the shoulder below it, but no trace of a short perpendicular 
line. The under parts are uniform whitish. The specimen is a female 
and laclvs the blue of the chin and sides. 

This species has the general appearance of S. graciosus, but has the 
scales above much larger and more elongated. The upper light yellow 
lines are narrower and more sliarply defined, being on one row of scales, 
separated by six or seven scales, instead of on one and two halves, sep- 
arated by inne or ten. The U-iuarks are better defined. There is uo 
trace of the short perpendicular black bar in front of the shoulder and 
little of the two on the posterior face of the thigh. The U-marks on 
the head are peculiar. The head is narrower; the plates anteriorly 
more symmetrical, and decidedly wrinkled instead of small. The feet 
are much shorter. 

From ^'. consohrinus it differs in the U-shai)ed marks on the back, the 
very narrow light lines on the middle of one row instead of on the adja- 
cent edges of two, the rugose plates of the head, the weak feet, the 
elongated thin scales.

404 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Tympanum more or less distinct. Body depressed, without dorsal 
crest; dorsal lepidosis heterogeneous. Head covered with small scales, 
bordered posteriorly by osseous spines. A transverse gnlar fold. Dig- 
its with keeled lamelhc inferiorly. Femoral pores. Tail short. Lateral 
teeth subconical or indistinctly tricuspid; no pterygoid teeth. A large 
sternal fontanelle. No abdominal ribs. 

This peculiar genus ranges over the Central, Pacific, and Souorau 
districts of Nearctica, and the political State of Mexico. It represents 
the extreme of the terrestrial habit in the Iguanidte, corresponding in 
this respect to Phynocephalus and Moloch among tlie Agamidte. The 
latter it resembles in the horny processes of the skull and hetero- 
geneous pholidosis, flat and spinous scales being mixed. The body is 
very flat, and this form can be increased at the will of the animal by 
the extension or abduction of the ribs which extend the abdominal 
border. In defense the muzzle is depressed and the horns elevated, as 
in Mammalia with posterior horns ; the back is also arched. Some of 
the species are said to eject a bloody fluid from the eyes at such a time, 
but this I have not observed. In life their horns constitute their only 
defense, as they possess no speed. They are, however, abundant in 
the dry regions of the southwest, where enemies are few, and where 
they can take refuge beneath the formidable spines of the Agaves aud 
Yuccas, and the prickles of the Opuntias. They can not be an attract- 
ive mouthful to snakes, and I once saw a dead rattlesnake with the 
horns of a Phrynosoma which it had swallowed penetrating the neck 
through the upper integument, one on each side of the vertebral col- 
umn. In confinement Phrynosomas can seldom be induced to eat, and 
they frequently lay eggs. 

Osteology. — The following account of the osteology is derived from the 
skeletons of three species, P. douglassii, P. cornntnni, and P. coronattm. 
The description applies equally to each of these species unless otherwise 
stated : 

The i)remaxillary has a very short alveolar portion which does not 
bound the nostrils below (or very little, P. coronatxm). It has a supe- 
rior spine and concave palatal border. The nasals are distinct and are 
excavated in front by the large narial openings. The frontal is single, 
is much narrowed in front by the prefrontals, but extends transversely 
posterior to the orbits, where it sends forward an acute process in the 
superciliary angle. The prefrontal is large and extends posteriorly to 
or beyond the middle of the supraorbital border. It sends posteriorly 
an acute superciliary process, which meets that of the frontal from 
behind, over the eye in P. cornutum; does not quite meet it in P. core 
7iatum, and fails to meet it by a longer interval in P. douglassii. The 
lachrymal is small and is not reached by the anterior angle of the jugal. 
The parietal is broad and short, and the pineal foramen pierces it at 
the coronal suture. Its lateral border is very little decurved to meet 
the petrosal. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 405 

■ Its strong ijarietoqiiadrate arcli supports a horn or tuberosity, and 
iiu most of the species the middle of the posterior border supports 
the same. The occipital is broadly articulated with the parietal in P. 
donglassii and P. coronatnm; in the former loosely, in the latter closely. 
In P. coniutum it aifords a narrow but firm support for the parietal. 
Paroccipital small, visible from behind. The postfrontal is visible as a 
^rudiment in P. douglas.sii, but it is apparently coossified in the other 
two species. Tlie postorbital is slender, expanding below for union 
{with jugal and supratemporal. The former bears two sharp tuberosi- 
ties in P. coronafKm, and the supratemporal two. In P. cornutum there 
is none on the jugal, but there are three on the supratemporal; and in 
\\P. douglmsii the arrangement is similar. Owing to the inferior posi- 
tion of the supratemporal, the quadrate is oblique forward and down- 
ward. It presents one conch, the external. The vomers are short, and 
are separated from each other for the posterior half or more of their 
:leugth by a hiatus, which continues posteriorly of about equal width 
[between the palatine and pterygoid pairs. The latter are short, wide, 
'and flat, and the palatine foramen is small; least and oval in P. coro- 
\natum; small and round in P. cornutum; larger and elongate in P. 
\douglassii. The ectopterygoid is decurved at its inner extremity. The 
presphenoid is wanting, and the suture between the sphenoid and the 
;basioccipital is persistent. The supraforaminal part of the petrosal is 
ivery short, and the infraforaminal part is not much produced, and has 
'a wide inferior groove. The epipterygoid originates behind the ecto- 
'pterygoid process, and has the peculiarity among Iguanid;e of not reach- 
ing the parietal, but of resting on the anterior border of the petrosal. 
The occipital condyle shows traces of its tripartite composition. The 
postoptic is curved and simple and does not reach the frontal bone. 
The latter is grooved on the middle line below. 

I The groove of Meckel's cartilage is open throughout in P. cornutum 
|md P. coronatum and distally only in P. douglassii. The coronoid is 
'lot produced liorizontally on the external face of the mandible, and the 
ilentary is not i)roduced beyond its posterior border. This element has 
|i reflected inferior border in the P. cornutum which is acutely dentate 
Posterior to the middle, characters absent from P. coronatum and P. 
'douglassii. In P. douglassii the surangular is not coossified with the 
'irticular, while it is so united in the other two species. The angle is 
lihort, and is directed downward and obliquely inward. 

The basihyal is wide and is ossified, and the second ceratobranchials 
ire very short and widely separated. The hypohyals are short and 
larry the ceratohyls on their extremities. ISTo expansions of lateral 
ilements. 

The vertebra; have no zygosphen articulation, but the prezygapophy- 
ical facet is carried upon the side of the neurapoi)hysis at an angle with 
he usual position. This furnishes the initial step in the production of 
1. zygosjihen. I find five cervical intercentra in J', cornutum and P. 



406 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

coronatum, and six in P. douglassii, exclusive of the iiitercentriim of the 
atlas, which has no hyi)apophysis. Ribs extend to the sacraui,and are 
attached to very short diapophyses. The two sacral diapophyses are 
separated by a wide fissure in the P. coronatum and P. douglassii, but 
are closely appressed in P. cornutum. On one side of the skeleton of 
P. douglassii the last lumbar vertebra carries, abnormally, a third sacral 
diapophysivS which reaches the ilium. Proximal part of caudal verte- 
brae with long- diapophyses. Caudal centra not segmented. Chevron 
bones intercentral, not uniting distally. Neural spines everywhere very 
low, those of the caudal vertebrte single. 

The suprascapula is exceptionally elongate, and the scapula is of 
moderate length and has a proscapular process. The coracoid has one 
emargination. The interclavicle is remarkable for the shortness of its 
posterior limb, which is shorter than the transverse limb in P. cornutum 
and P. douglassii, and equal to it in P. coronatum. The sternum has a 
very large fontanelle which approaches the jiosterior border. In P. 
coronatum and P. douglassii three ribs articulate with the sternum, but 
in P. cornutum two only in my skeleton. The xiphoid rods are widely 
separated, and carry but one rib. 

The ilium has a short angulus cristm, and the acetabulum is entire. 
The pubis and ischium are slender and transverse in position, and 
approach nearly at their symphyses, which are connected by a short, 
narrow cartilage. The pectineal process is obsolete, while the tuber 
ischii is a prominent angle. 

Two peculiarities especially distinguish this genus among Iguanidse: 
First, the connection of the epipterygoid with the petrosal, and, second, 
the absence of symphysis of the chevron bones. The characters of the 
sternum are an extreme of what is seen in Sceloporus. 

Viscera. — The distinction between the large and small intestine is 
well marked, and there is a large colon, which is set off from the rectum 
by a strong constriction. The liver is large, and extends farther i)0S- 
teriorly than in any genus of Iguanidie. The left lobe is larger than 
in any other genus, extending in most species as for posteriorly as the 
much narrower right lobe. The posterior border is deeply excavated 
between them. The mesenteries are of the usual type, except that 
there is a right hepatoventral in addition to the usual one. It has a 
position so far to the right side as to be as well termed a hepatolateral. 
The usual hepatoventral, in consequence of the elongation of the left 
lobe of the liver, which it follows, extends to or nearly to the trans- 
verse or cystic mesenteric fold. 

The penis in P. asio is short, and terminates glans-like, in which the 
rims of opposite sides turn inward toward the obtuse apex on one 
side. As they turn inward they become separated from the remainder 
of the glans by a groove, which becomes deep and defines a median lobe 
between them, which forms the apex of the organ. The grooves do not 
continue on the side opposite to that on which they originate. The 
surface of the organ is deeply longitudinally plicate, but at the apex

of both lateral and mediau lobes the plicit* iuosculate, formiug a tripe-

These si)ecies may be also grouped as follows, by consideration of 
certain characters of the sqnamation : 

I. Several subrictal projecting plates; temporal row of conic plates not continued 
to bplow orbit. I^argc dorsal scales without rosette at l)ase. Two occipital 
horns. Femoral pores in the interior of scuta. 

P. orbicularc; P. doiitjlassii; P. boucardii; P. braconnierii. 



408 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

II. Ono large subrictal projectiug jilate; temporal row of couic, plates continued to 
below orbit; dorsal scales witbout basal I'osette. Femoral pores on borders of 
scuta. Two occipital horns P. coronatum; P. cerroense; P. hIainviUei. 

III. No subrictal prominent scale; temporal row not continued to below orbit; four 
occipital horns; large dorsal scales generally without rosette; femoral pores in 
interior of scuta P. solare. 

IV. No subrictal prominent scale; temporal cones not continued to below orbit; 
large dorsal scales with basal rosette; one occipital horn; femoral pores at mar- 
gins of scuta /'. cornutum; P. asio; P. taurus. 

The attempt lias been made to define more than one genus from the 
characters presented by the above species. One of the characters 
viewed as indicating this result is the varying position of the nostrils 
as regards the canthus rostralis. On this basis the P. coronatum 
might be as readily referred to one division as the other, as it is in this 
respect exactly intermediate. Such a division would violate the affini- 
ties expressed in the second table. This is, however, not an insuperable 
objection, as allied genera not infrequently possess parallel series of 
species. 

The largest species is the southwest Mexican P. asio. It is remark- 
able for the reduction of its temporal horns to two on each side, and 
the large size of its superciliary horns, which equal the posterior tem- 
poral and occipital in length. The P. taurus, from southeastern Mexico, 
is remarkable for the presence of only one temporal spine, which is 
very large, and the abortion of all the other spines, of which the occip- 
ital are represented by rudiments. Eleven species are known, three 
being restricted to the tropical parts of Mexico, namely, P. asio, P. 
taiirus, and P. hraconnierii. 

Habits. — Under the head of Phrynosoma doufflassii, Dr. Stejneger' 
thus writes of the metachrosis, which is so observable in this genus: 

Much has been written in regard to the perfection with which these animals 
"imitate" the color of the ground on which they live, and our own observations 
fully verilied the statement that they afford one of the most striking examples of 
protective mimicry. 

In the cedar and pine belts of the San Francisco Mountain the dark color of the 
soil and stones covering the surface is closely matched by the ground color of the 
Phrynosomas, while the greenish gray and orange colored markings, which some- 
what irregularly adorn their backs, are perfect imitations of the lichens covering the 
rocks and pebbles among which these odd-looking creatures live. Near the rim of 
the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, on the other hand, the ground is covered with 
small pebbles of variously colored sandstone, ranging from a clayey white to brick 
red and dark brown, and the specimen which I collected there (No. 15721) is such a 
faithful reproduction of the surroundings that it would undoubtedly have remained 
undetected had it not been moving. Even more remarkable are the specimens which 
Dr. Merriam collected in the black lava belt, east and northeast of the mountain. 
One of these (No. 15815) was brought to camp aliv(^, enabling me to make the fol- 
lowing description of the fresh colors: "Ground color of upper side, including head, 
satiny black; light markings on median third of body dull 'Naples yellow,' abruptly 
changing into the yellow ocher of those on the sides; tips of most lateral spines 

'North American Fauna, No. 3, 1890, p. 114. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 409 

white; tips of largest cephalic spines marbled w'.th ochei*; underside yellowish

Outline of head from above, parabolic; profile of muzzle descending 
steeply and convex to a projecting lip border. Temporal region wide, 
but not especially expanded. Nostril iu the line of the canthus ros- 
tralis. Horns represented by conical protuberances on each side. 
Three temporals and one occipital, of which the occipital is about as 
prominent as the second temporal and less so than the third temporal. 
Occipitals widely separated at base. The temporal row of scales is 
continued to below the orbit, but the latter are not prominent. Scales 
of vertex convex, rugose; occipital and two posterior to it, with one 
within and adjoining the posterior superciliary, a little larger than the 
others. Six posterior inferior labials enlarged, the most posterior with 
produced angles, forming a series of subrictals. One series of enlarged 
infralabials, which are not so prominent and do not extend as far pos- 
teriorly as the subrictals. Two short oblique rows of conic scales on 
the side of the neck, tlie superior the longer. Two large scales in ver- 
tical relation behind nasal, and separated from it by a row of smaller 
scales. A small keystone superciliary. Gular scales rounded, smooth. 

Median dorsal scales flat, keeled, of irregular sizes, but not so large 
as in the species of the cornntum or coroiKdiim groui)S. Lateral dorsal 
scales rounded, smaller, but not so small as in the coronatum group. 
The large isolated keeled scales are less conspicuous than in the other 
gi'oups and are in about four rows on each side. They are not sur- 
rounded by a rosette at base. A single series of moderately elongate- 
closely placed marginal scales, commencing anterior to the groin and 



410 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898, 



terniiiiatiug above posterior to the axilla. A single ])romiuent scale 
above the Immeriis. A series of conic scales on each side of the tail, 
which are not so prominent as the large keeled sj)inous scales which 
project from among the flat ones of its superior surface. Superior face 
of arm and cubitus covered with large acute keeled scales; of leg and 
thigh with smaller scales, among which large prominent keeled and 
spinous scales are mingled. Scales of inferior surfaces smooth, except 
those of the distal part of the cubitus, the distal half of the tail, and 
of the palms and soles, which are keeled. Lateral digital scales not 
produced. 

Tlie legs are shorter than in any other North American species, the 
posterior ones when extended reaching barely three-fourths the dis- 
tance to the axilla. The tail varies in length in the subspecies from 
about twice the head in the tyj^ical form to more than three times in 
the subspecies hernandesii. Femoral pores, sixteen on each thigh, the 
series approaching but not meeting on the middle line. 

Measurements. — Total length, 111 mm. ; length to vent, 80 mm. ; length 
to gular fold, 19 mm. ; length of head with occipital horn, 19 mm. ; length 
of head without a horn, 17 mm.; width at temporal region, 23 mm.; 
length of fore leg, 32 mm.; length of fore foot, 11 mm.; length of hind 
leg, 40 mm.; length of hind foot, 19 mm. 

The ground color of the superior surface of this species is variable 
and under the control of the animal in a large degree. It may be pale, 
ashy, brown, reddish, or nearly black. There is no distinct vertebral 
stripe. There is a large dark nuchal spot on each side and three double 
dorsal spots on each side of the body. These spots may be separate 
or fused, in the latter case forming a cross baud with posterior bilobate 
outline. They are ill defined anteriorly, but posteriorly they are well 
defined, and frequently have a i^ale or even bright colored border. 
Tail and limbs obscurely cross-banded above; head uniform brown. 
Inferior surfaces uniform cream-colored, unspotted, except on the gular 
region, where small black spots are frequently i)resent. The small 
cranial horns are frequently pink. 

This species has much the most northern range of all the Phrynoso- 
mas, inhabiting Oregon, parts of Washington, and Montana. To the 
eastward it extends into Montana, Nebraska, and Kansas, and to the 
south to Soccoro, New Mexico, and middle Arizona. It does not occur 
in Texas, so far as known. It is thus especially characteristic of the 
central region and the northern i)art of the Pacific. Within this range 
it ijresents three modifications. Specimens from the northern Pacific 
region are of smaller size than those from the Central region, and the tail 
is short ; a larger brighter-colored and also short-tailed form from the 
deserts of the great basin, and a larger and long-tailed form from the 
Rocky Mountain region and eastward. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 411 

Dr. Elliott Cones thus describes the habits of this species as observed 
by him : ' 

Like other 8i>t>cies of the same gouus, this Phry)iosoma is slow of foot and readily 
captured; it makes au interesting pet to one foiul of observing the traits of lower 
animals. It may readily be secured by a thread tied behind its " horns," and in 
this state of partial liberty its habits may be studied to advantage. It is one of the 
most inort'ensive and amiable of reptiles, though some of the largest and boldest 
individuals sometimes make a slight demonstration in self-defense by biting weakly. 
It usually submits at once without remonstrance. When handled, it has a way of 
making itself perfectly flat, when, closing its eyes, it will simulate death in this 
collapsed state. Under some circumstances it will swell up the body prodigiously 
till it assumes a nearly spherical shape. It has a sly way of watching for a chauce 
to escape by bolting away when it thinks Itself unobserved, and a still nuire curious 
knack of burying itself in sand or other loose soil. This is accomplished by a grad- 
ual lateral and forward insinuating wriggling of the body, with the muzzle pointed 
downward and the limbs drawn close to the sides. A few moments suffice for its 
disajipearance. A certain slight means of defense which the "horns" may some- 
times afi'ord is shown by the use they are pnt to wheu the animal is irritated by 
poking with a finger or bit of a stick; then the head is lowered, the horns set for- 
ward, the back arched up, and the whole attitude becomes ludicrously like that of 
abull in miniainre. The horned lizards show special aversion to dogs. On approach 
of one they raise themselves to the full length of the legs, puff out the body, open 
the mouth, and hiss audibly, altogether presenting quite a formidable front. Their 
food, iu confinement and otherwise, consists chiefly of flies and other insects, which 
they capture by a quick thrust of the flesby tongue, lubricated with viscid saliva. 
I have not observed the time of coition nor the period of gestation, but most of the 
females are found pregnant in July, and the youug appear in great uumbers in 
August. The male is usually smaller thau the female and of slenderer form. 

The varieties of this species have been distinguished by Girard as 
species, and they have been thus defined by Stejneger:^ 

Size small ; horns rudimental; tail short; colors obscure P. d.doitglassii. 

Size larger; median horns directed posteriorly; tail longer; body more spinous; 

colors obscure P. d. Iteniandczii. 

Size largest ; median horns directed upward; colors more brilliant. . /'. d. ornatisvimum. 

An examination of a large series of specimens shows that the above 
characters define races which do not seem to me to be sufficiently dis- 
tinct to represent subspecies. Thus the direction of the occipital horns 
is not constantly associated with other characters, and the length of 
the tail of some specimens and of P. d. oniatissimnm is equal to that of 
some individuals of P. d. hcrnandesL

observable are : The rather shorter muzzle, which is entirely vertical in 
profile; the smaller scales above the canthus of the mouth and tempo- 
ral bones, the less prominence of the posterior superciliary angle, and 
the nmch reduced size. 

On the elevated land which represents the Sierra Nevada Eange, 
between Warners Lake and Goose Lake, in the basaltic region near 
the former, I found a peculiar variety of this species. The horns arc

even more rudimentary than in the usual form, but are all represented. 
The prominent scales of the back are smaller and less prominent. In 
some of the specimens the head is sliorter relatively to the body. The 
color is an iron-rust brown, with darker lateral spots, each with a small 
posterior yellow border. Individuals are abundant; some of those taken 
are full of eggs. All are much smaller than P. doufjlassii hernandc.si. 
This form is confined to the northern part of the Pacific district.

In tliis form the " temporal" (supratemporal) region is produced far- 
ther i)osteriorly than in the typical examples of /*. d. heriiandesi, so that 
the occipital emargination is deeper. Theyoimj;- present the form char- 
acteristic of the latter species ; however, this character may be associated 
with long-tailed specimens of obscure coloration. The tail of the female

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



of the P. d. ornatissimum is very short, but in the male it is sometimes 
more than half the length of the head and body, as in P. hernandesi. 
The typical coloration consists of dark -brown spots surrounded by a 
yellow border on the dorsal region, but the yellow border may be 
visible on the posterior side of the spot, as in P. hernandesi. The spots 
may also extend to the sides, as in that form I do not find the differ- 
ences in the form of the head to be constant, although in typical forms 
that of the P. d. ornatissimum is more obtuse than in the P. d. hernandesi.

figs. 4, 4a; Pt. 3, 1874, p. 225. 

Head, thick; wider than long. Cephalic spiues of moderate length; 
those of the occiput directed obliquely upward, a little more prolonged 
backward than the longest ones of the temporal region. Numerous 
occipital tubercles. Trihedral scales of the body projecting. Abdom- 
inal scales smooth. Head with top relatively narrow, not equal half 
its greatest length ; the contour from the end of the muzzle to the super- 
ciliary angle a little curved oblique line. Inframaxillary scutella rec- 
tangular, a little smaller than the post«rior sublabials; one conical, 
pyramidal scale at the junction of the lips; nostrils pierced on the pro- 
longed superciliary ridge; auricular o])ening bordered anteriorly with 
small projecting scales; occipital plate distinct, oval, and followed by 
numerous conical scales; upper part of the body bristling with project- 
ing trihedral tubercles. Eleven to fourteen pores on the inner side of 
the thigh; tail about two-fifths the length of the animal and character- 
ized in the males by a little greater length, a thicker base, and by two 
postanal scales somewhat larger than the others. A fringe around the 
l)eriphery of the ab<lomen formed of twenty-six or twenty-seven large 
trihedral, subpyramidal scales; four similar scales over each arm; length 
of tibia equal to the distance between the end of the snout and the 
beginning of the occipital spines; scales of the belly and the under- 
side of tlu^ tail smooth; those of the throat feebly keeled. 

Ground color ocher yellow, with four brown spots extending on both 
sides of the vertebral line; the one on the neck large and rounded, the 
three others, on the trunk, subrectangular, with bright yellow poste- 
rior borders; legs and tail crossed by similar brown bands; head and 
cephalic spines sienna brown. Underside yellowish, with rounded 
blackish spots scattered far apart.

characters: Interorbital space narrower; occipital spines implanted 
obliquely; occipital tubercles smaller, and consequently more numer- 
ous; trihedral scales of all parts of the body more bristling; and the 
gular scales feebly keeled and not eutirely smooth. (Bocourt.) 

The erect direction of the occipital spines of this species distiuguishes 
it from the others of the orhiculare group. 

No specimens of the Phrynosoma houcardii are in the U. S. National 
Museum. M. Bocourt's specimens came from the "Plateau of Mexico," 
without further specification of locality.

Outline of muzzle from above broadly rounded ; in profile abruptly 
descending without conspicuous angle with front, nor prominent lip 
border. Nostrils presenting anteriorly only, the nasal plates sepa- 
rated by a row of scales from the series of the can thus rostralis, which 
pass externally to them. Temporal region considerably expanded. 
Posterior superciliary angle produced horizontally. Four occipital 
horns of subequal length, the external pair slightly divergent, and all 
directed backward 45°. Each horn depressed, and with the basal por- 
tions marked with flat tubercles. Only three prominent temporal 
scales, and all of these produced into horns, which are flat and recurved 
to the acute tips. The posterior, which is the longest, is not equal to 
the external occipital. Temporal row of scales not produced to below 
the orbit, but a row of protuberant scales above it reaches the same 
point. Scales of top of head flat, tubercular. Two transverse rows 
of conic scales, of four scales each, posterior to the occipital, the exter- 
nal of the posterior row the largest. No angle or row of larger scales 
connecting the posterior superciliaries. A well-developed keystone 
plate. Infralabials eight on each side, all prominent except tlie ante- 
rior three, the seventh largest and as long as the anterior temporal 
spine, the eighth smaller and spiuiform. No subrictal. Enlarged 
gulars in a single row, with acute apices, the posterior not enlarged. 
Two rows of spines on the side of the neck, the superior shorter and 
more bunchy. 

Dorsal scales flat, the median much larger than the lateral, keeled, 
and with small, round tubercles on the plane portions. Four spaced 
rows of larger keeled scales on each side of the middle line, those of 
the external rows much smaller than those of the median. These 
extremities are scarcely free, but those of the penultimate row are 
most prominent, especially anteriorly, where the external row is 
wanting. Lateral fringe continued to above humerus from groin, its

are keeked and mucronate. Colhir serrate except at middle. The hind 
lej? extended falls short of the axilla. The tail is rather long, exceed- 
ing by a little twice the length of the head without the horns. First 
and fifth toes of equal length on both extremities. Femoral pores 
eleven to fifteen on each side, the rows continuous on the median line, 
or nearly so. 

Aleasnremcnts (Sonora). — Total length, 140 mm.; length to vent, 89 
mm.; length to gular fold, 10.5 mm.; length of head Avith horns, 32 mm.; 
length of head without horns, 22 mm.; Width of head at temporal 
region, 19 mm.; length of fore leg, 40 mm.; length of fore foot, 12 mm.; 
length of hind leg, 49 mm.; length of hind foot, 20 mm. 

General (;olor above light brown; median line pale; lateral nuchal 
spots present, obscure; three or four pairs of blackish blotches on each 
side of the median line, which are of irregular outline, concave for- 
ward, and not fused into transverse bands; tail and limbs with broad, 
brown cross bands; inferior surfaces immaculate; head light brown, 
horns paler. 

This species occupies an isolated position in the genus for several 
reasons. The presence of four equally developed occipital horns instead 
of the two which characterize all the other species, the continuity of 
the femoral pore series across the middle line, and the tuberculation 
of the scales are the principal ones. The squamation is like that of 
the coronation group, but in the short series of scales ending in the 
temporal horns it is more like the cornutum group, with which it 
also agrees in the matters of iufralabials and inferior gular scales. 

Specimens of this species display some noteworthy differences. In 
two Arizona individuals the temporal and occipital horns are in a 
single slightly curved plane. In the specimen from Sonora, above 
described, the second and third (posterior) temporals are on a dis- 
tinctly lower plane. In Cat. No. 161, also from Sonora, these horns are 
depressed, but less so. In Cat. No. 8437, from Arizona, the series of 
femoral pores are separated on the middle line by four rows of scales, 
and the pores number on one side eighteen and on the other twenty. In 
Cat. No. 17179, from Tucson, the series include twenty pores each, and 
are separated by one scale on the nnddle line. In my Sonoran indi- 
vidual but one scale separates the adjacent pores of opposite rows, and 
the latter contain 11-12 pores. In Cat. No. 101 each row contains seven- 
teen pores, and five rows separate them at the middle. In Cat. No. 8437 
there is on each side of the superior side of the tail, beyond the base, a 
tetrahedral conic scale looking directly upward, which is wanting in the 
Sonoran specimen. In Cat. No. 8437 one has seven and the other eight 
large iufralabials; there are seven in the Sonoran individual. Cat. No. 
17179 has seven on one side and eight on the other. No other differ- 
ences are observable. 

The Plirynosoma solare is restricted to the Sonoran region. It has

Mr. Van Denburgh gives Las Animas Bay, Lower California, as a 
locality from which he has seen a specimen. 

It is with regret that I adopt for this species the name of Gray in 
preference to that of Girard. The description of Gray is unworthy of 
the name, being only a line in length, and may apply to this or to some 
unknown species so far as its terms go. Moreover, he evidently did not 
regard it as a good species, but placed his specimen under the head of 
P. hlainvillei, as belonging to that species. An examination of the 
specimen in the British Museum, showed me that it is to an example of 
the P. regale, that the name P. solare applies, and as technically one line 
is a description, I am compelled to side this time with the pettifoggers, 
and adopt it.

Outline of muzzle from above narrowed elliptic; in profile descend- 
ing obliquely and not separated from frontal plane by a distinct angle. 
Nostrils directed as much laterally as forward, in line with canthus 
rostralis. Posterior superciliary angle little produced. Temporal 
region moderately expanded, terminating in a straight horn nearly as 
long as the occipital, and diverging outward. Occipital horn elongate, 
straight, slightly divergent, depressed in section, and, like all the other 
horns, finely grooved longitudinally. Infralabial plates with prominent 
angles from the first, the median longer than the i)osterior, which are 
small, except the very last, which is a conical spine. Between the 
shorter scales the last inferior labial is developed into a large, flat, tri-

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



iiugular spine, the iufrarictal. The conic spine above mentioned is as 
much opposite to this plate as to the infrahibials. On the neck two 
short fokls, one above and posterior to the other, with three conic spines 
on each. Three rows of enlarged gular scales on each side of the mid- 
dle line, with conic apices directed externally; those of the external 
row the largest, and followed by a few smaller spines on the gular fold. 
Scales of top of head convex and obscurely roughened ; a transverse 




series of four conic scales in front of the base of th3 occipital horns, 
and a similar one between the bases of the latter. Anterior and pos- 
terior superciliary plates in contact, with a small '< keystone " below 
their opposed apices. 

Dorsal pholidosis irregular. Medially the scales are flat and keeled, 
but they become much smaller and graniform laterally, where they are 
separated by smaller granules. A band of smaller flat scales, down 
the vertebral line, bounded by larger scales on each side. External to 
these there are four rows of well-separated, large, keeled scales, with 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 425 

free apices directed posteriorly, without a circle of scales around their 
bases. A marginal fringe of flat lanceolate scales, extending from 
anterior to tlie groin to above the shoulder, and a lower marginal series 
of much smaller scales along the middle part of the lateral border. 
Between the superior row and the larger dorsal scales are several lon- 
gitudinal folds, surmounted each with a series of oval keeled scales 
larger than those that surround them. Superior surfaces of fore limb 
with large keeled mncronate scales, mixed with a few of smaller size. 
Upper surface of posterior limb with small scales, and scattered large 
keeled spinous scales. Tail with a lateral fringe of large, flat, lanceo- 
late scales to near the extremity; the superior surface with irregular 
pholidosis of flat keeled scales, some with projecting apices. Scales 
of all the inferior surfaces smooth, except those of the humerus and 
tibia, which are weakly keeled. Keeled scales of front of humerus not 
continued across the middle line. 

Extended hind leg reaching to axilla or middle of humerus. Tail 
a little over twice as long as head without horns. Femoral pores 
fifteen in each row, which is separated from the opposite one by a wide 
interspace. 

Measurements (San Diego, California). — Total length, 147 mm. ; length 
to vent, 92 mm.; length to gular fold, 20 mm.; length of head with 
occipital horn, 32 mm.; length of head without occipital horn, 22 mm,; 
width of head at temporal region, 23 mm.; length of fore leg, 43 mm.; 
length of fore foot, 26 mm.; length of hind leg, 57 mm.; length of hind 
fitot, 23 mm. 

Color above light brown ; head light-yellowish brown, without darker 
markings. Temporal spines light red or pink, occipital horns mahog- 
any brown, with reddish apices; the ridges darker than the grooves. 
Lateral nuchal brown spots large, well sej)arated. Between these and 
the groin on each side three dusky brown bilobate cross bands, 
obscurely defined anteriorly; in young specimens with imperfect pos- 
terior light border. Inferior surface of limbs and tail with a few obscure 
crossbars. Inferior surfaces immaculate, except a few obscure dusky 
spots on the abdomen in some individuals. 

This species inhabits the southern part of the Pacific district, that 
is, California south of San Francisco Bay, and the upper part of the 
peninsula of Lower California, at least as far south as San Thomas 
(Van Denburgh). In the northern part of the Pacific district its place 
is taken by the P. douf/lassii. No other species occupies the range of 
the F. hlainvillei. 

Mr. Van Denburgh states that specimens from the northern part of 
this range have the head scales less convex and more rugose than in 
those from the southern ])()rtion of it, and he proposes to regard the 
former as a distinct species, under the name of P. frontale. No other 
character is advanced by Mr. Van Denburgh, so that specific distinct- 
ness can scarcely be admitted. Perhaps a race is indicated, Irs value 
appears, however, to be problematical, as specimens in my possession 



42G REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

from Sail Diego, in the extreme soutli, have the bead scales strongly 
rugose, althougli convex. 

Mr. Vau Denbiirgli points out that this species differs from the P. 
coronatum in the presence of a spine behind the subrictal scale, a char- 
acter which I find to be quite constant. I may add that the P. coro- 
natum is more horny as to the peripheral parts of the skull. There are 
four horns of the temporal series, of which the anterior is below the 
eye. In P. blainvillei this scale is little or not larger than the one that 
succeeds it. In P. hlai7ivillei a postorbital row of scales is very pro- 
tuberant, and not so in P. coronatum. In P. hlamvillei there is but one 
row of scales in the marginal fringe of the tail, while there are two in 
P. coronatum. 

Habits. — Dr. Stejneger states that it is to P. blainvillei that the pub- 
lished accounts about ejecting blood from the eyes should be credited, 
and one of the specimens in the collection brought home (Cat. No. 18452) 
is the offender who gave rise to Dr. O. P. Hay's entertaining article' on 
this subject. It transpired afterwards that this specimen had been sent 
me [Stejneger] alive for the very reason that it had been ejecting blood 
repeatedly when caught. The letter from Mr. Bailey accompanying the 
Sl)ecimen turned u^i long after Dr. Hay's experience with the animal, and 
it is to the following effect: 

Kernville, Cal., July 11, 1S91. 
Deah Sir: I caught a horned toad to-day that very much surprised Dr. Fisher 
and myself by squirting blood from its eyes. It was on smooth ground and not in 
brush or weeds. I caught it with my hand and just got my fingers on its tail as it 
ran. On taking it in my hand a little jet of blood spurted from one eye a distance 
of 15 inches and spattered on my shoulder. Turning it over to examine the eye, 
another stream spurted from the other eye. This he did four or five times from both 
eyes until my hands, clothes, and guu were sprinkled over with fine drops of bright 
red blood. I put it in a bag and carried it to camp, where, about four hours later, I 
showed it to Dr. Fisher, when it spurted three more streams from its eyes. One of 
the same species that I caught July 2 evidently did the same, as I found its head 
covered with blood when I caught it, but supposed it was injured in the weeds. It 
seems so strange that I send the horned toad to you alive. 

Vernon Bailey. 

The specimen upon its arrival was handled a great deal, but gave 
no evidence of its blood-squirting tendencies until the beginning of 
August, when it resented Dr. Hay's handling it somewhat roughly in 
the manner related. In order to give the entire history of this animal, 
I reprint Dr. Hay's account as follows : 

About tiie 1st of August it was shedding its outer skin, and the process appeared 
to be a difficult one, since the skin was dried and adhered closely. One day it 
occurred to me that it miglit facilitate matters if I should give the animal a wetting; 
so, taking it up, I carried it to a wash basin of water near by and suddenly tossed 
the lizard into the water. Tlie first surprise was probably experienced by the rimj- 
vosoma, but the next surprise was my own, for on one side of the basin there sud- 
denly appeared a number of spots of red fluid, which resembled blood. ... A 
microscope was soon procured and au examination was made, whicii immediately 
showed that the matter ejected was reallv blood.

The afTalr now bociimo very intcrc^ling. .Fust where the blood came from I couUl 
not (U'torinino with eertaiiity, the whole thing having happened so suddenly and 
unexpectedly ; yet the appe.-iranco seemed to indicate that the blood came from the 
region about one of the eyes. There appeared to be a considerable quantity of the 
blood, since on the sides of the A'essel and on the wall near it I counted ninety of 
the little splotches. A consultation was had with Dr. Stejneger the next day with 
regard to the projiriety of dashing tho* animal into the water again to discover, if 
possible, where the blood came from. It was thought, liowever, that such blood 
lettiugs must be somewhat exliausting, and that it would be better to allow the 
animal a day to recuperate. While talking, I picked up the lizard and was liolding 
it between my thumb and middle linger and stroking its horns with my forefinger. 
All at once a quantity of blood was thrown out against my fingers, and a portion of 
it ran down on the animal's neck ; and this blood came directly out of the right eye. 
It was shot backward and a]ipeared to issue from the outer canthus. It was impos- 
sible to determine just how much there was of the blood, but it seemed there must 
have been a (juarter of a teaspoonful. I went so far as to taste a small quantity of 
it, but all that I could detect was a slight musky llavor.

occipital and divergent in direction. Occipital lioru straight, acute, 
divergent, slightly grooved at base, directed posteriorly at an angle of 
•15°. Scales of front fiat, rugose, large; those of supraocular series in 
contact. jSTo angle connecting superciliary angles. Four conic scales 
in a transverse series in front of occiput; a median occipital conic 
scale. Ko prominent scales between the temporal series and the orbit. 
Only live infralabials on each side, the last prominent and anterior 
to the line of the larger subrictal. A conic scale or spine in the line of 
the infralabials, behind the subrictal. Three rows of enlarged gulars 
on each side, the external conic and acute, and continued to the gular 
fold. Behind the line of the tympanic meatus two longitudinal rows 
of scales, the inferior of two spiniform, the superior of five or six simply 
conic. 

Five to eight rows of rtat-keeled scales on the median dorsal region; 
some of which, forming an irregular row on each side, are much larger 
than the others. External to these the scales are rounded and much 
smaller, and are separated by granules. On each side of the middle 
line are three rows (including the one above mentioned) of large, 
prominent-keeled scales, well separated from each other. A single 
series of free lanceolate scales forms a lateral fringe, w^hich begins 
in front of the groin and returns to above the humerus, with an inter- 
ruption above the axilla. Below this the scales are granular, and then 
gradually enlarge into the ventrals, which are smooth and about as 
large as the median dorsals. Superior sides of humerus and cubitus 
covered with large keeled scales; femur and tibia above with small, 
flat scales mixed with large accuminate ones. Tail with two series of 
lateral marginal conic scales, the superior row sparse. Scales of supe- 
rior surface of tail heterogeneous, but no produced cones. Scales of 
inferior surfaces of limbs smooth, except those of palm and sole, which 
are keeled. Lateral digital scales not produced. 

The extended hind limb falls considerably short of the axilla. The 
tail is between once and twice the length of the head without horns. 
Femoral pores 17 or 18 in each series, which are well separated on the 
middle line. 

McasKrements (Cat. :^o. 11977).— Total length, 112 mm. ; length to vent, 
85 mm.; length to gular fold, 17 mm.; length to base of occipital horn, 
17 mm.; length to end of occipital horn, 23.5 mm.; width at temporal 
region, 21.5 mm.; length of fore leg, 31 mm.; length of fore foot, 11 
mm.; length of hind leg, 40 mm.; length of hind foot, 19 mm. 

Ground color brownish ashen, paler on the limbs and tail. A large 
brown lateral nuchal spot, and three irregular cross bands on the back, 
the third at the groin. Each crosa band displays a deep notch poste- 
riorly, and the external j)ortiou extends posteriorly. Joining the one 
behind it, causing the flanks to be entirely brown. No distinct cross 
bands on limbs and tail; snout and muzzle brown; occipital horns 
mahogany. Inferior surfaces cream colored, with a few indistinct dusky 
spots on the abdomen.

As already sliowu, this species is au ally of the P. coronatum and 
P. hlainvillei, between which it stands in some respects, while it adds 
some characters of its own. Of the latter kind are the absence of the 
inferior lateral fringe, the cylindric horns, and the continnation of 
the enlarged gnlars to the gular fold. It agrees with the P. hlainvillei 
in the presence of a spine behind the snbrictal, the absence of a prom- 
inent row of tubercles behind the orbit, in the small size of the inter- 
occipital scale, and the straightness of the occipital horns. It agrees 
with the P. coronatum in the suborbital cone, the double fringe of the 
tail, and the flat head scales. But one specimen of this species is 
known. It was brought from Cerros Island, which is off the west 
coast of Lower California, at about the middle of its length.

The nostrils are pierced in the lines joining the superciliary ridges 
with the end of the snout. There are several longitudinal series of 
large, pointed, gular scales, the exterior of which are continued back 
upon the gular folds. There is a series of line, very large, pointed sub 
labial plates. The head spines are very large. There are four tem- 
porals, one occipital, and one postorbital on each side, and one large 
interoccipital. Occasionally small spines are developed between the 
temporals. Below the rictus is a broad spine, usually without any, but 
sometimes with a very small spine behind it. There is a row of four or 
five spinose scales in front of the occipital spines. The other head 
scales, with few exceptions, are flat aud rugose, usually with irregular

ridges riuliatiiig from near the center of each scale. There are two 
gronps of spines on eacli side of the neck, the lower larger. The tail 
is bordered with a single row of lateral spines and bears a group of 
smaller ones behind the insertion of the thigh. There are two series 
of periphero-abdominal spines, the lower shorter than the upper and 
formed of smaller spines. The scales on the chest are sometimes 
faintly keeled. Those on the abdomen and basal part of the tail are 
smooth ; on the terminal part of tail, keeled. The tymi)anum is naked. 
There are from sixteen to twenty-two femoro-preanal pores. The males 
have enlarged postanal plates. The tails of the females are shorter 
than the distance from the axilla to the front of the thigh, but those of 
the male are considerably longer than this distance. The young of

both sexes have short tails. The color above is brownish, yellowish, 
or grayish, darker laterally. There is a large brown patch on ea<;h 
side of the neck, and a series of three more or less distinct brown bars 
on each side of the back. These bars are light-bordered posteriorly. 
The tail is transversely banded with brown. The belly is often dotted 
or blotched with brown or black. All these markings are more distinct 
in the young. The larger dorsal tubercles are often tipped with orange- 
rufous, and those on each side of the median line have seal-brown or 
black keels. The occipital si>ines are ribbed with very dark brown. 
The temples are yellow tinged with rufous. In very young individuals 
the scales of the vertex are grayish or yellowish-white, with a few 
minute brown or l)lack spots. These spots, which are on the raised 
portions of the scales, become more numerous as the animals increase

Phrynosoma coronatum was first described from a specimen collected 
by Botta iu "California." It has since been recorded from Cape St. 
Lucas and La Paz. The specimens enumerated below show that it 
ranges far north of the limits of the "Cape Region."

with rather smoke brown cross-bands. Inferior surfaces cream color, 
sometimes with small scattered dusky spots. 

The range of this species exceeds that of any other rhrynosomo. It 
extends from Dallas, Texas, on the east to Chihualiua, inclusive, on the 
the west, and from the Gulf of Mexico on the south to southern Kan- 
sas and Colorado on the north. It does not occur on the Pacific slope. 
It is very common in Texas and south to Monterey, Mexico, and in 
New Mexico as far north as Taos. Like other species of the genus, it 
loves dry places and sunshine. It has a habit of running in roads, 
where a good many aie killed in ruts, yet a larger number climb out 
and escape, to the surprise of the traveler, who thinks they are doomed 
to death. They are favorites as pets, and if they will eat, live a con- 
siderable time in confinement. They not infrequently, however, starve 
themselves to death, though their cai)acity to live without Ibod is mar- 
velous. The horns of this species are more acute than those of any of 
the others, which makes it more dangerous as an article of diet for 
snakes. I once found a dead snake with the occipital horns of this 
species i)rotruding on opposite sides of the vertebral column near the 
head. 

A specimen with smooth abdominal scales was the basis of the nom 
iual si)ecies P. plani/rons.

ANOTA Hallowell. 

. Jnota Hallowell, Proc, Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 18.52, p. 182. — Bocourt, Mission 
Sci. Hex., Kept., 1874, p. 230. 
Doliosaurus Girard, U. S. Expl. Exp. (Cli. Wilkes), Horpet., 1858, p. 407. 

This genus only differs from Phrynosoma in tbe concealment of the 
tympanic drum by the integument, which is scaly. Girard has pro- 
posed another name for it on the ground that Anota is preoccupied. 
But this is not the case, as such names as Anotia, Anotus, etc., cannot 
be regarded as identical with Anota, 

Four species are known to me, which differ as follows: 

I. No marginal abdominal fringe of elongated scales. 

a. No enlarged gnlar scales. 

h. Nostrils above or within the canthus rostralis. 

Horns moderate; i)osterior temporal about equal to occipital ; enlarged 
dorsal scales not prominent; veutrals smooth; small. J. modts^a Girard. 

II. One series of elongate marginal abdomiual scales. 
a. No enlarged gular scales. 

Occipital horns with acute tubercle at external base; head scales much 
divided; twelve labials to middle of eye; caudal fringe coarse; cross- 
spotted A. calidiarum Cope. 

III. Two .series of elongate marginal abdominal scnlos (the inferior wanting pos- 

teriorly). 
a. No enlarged gular scales. 

i. Nostrils within canthus rostralis. 

Tyiiii)anum scidy ; horns well developed; infralabiala prominent; large 
dorsals not prominent ; veutrals smooth J . goodei .Stejueger.

aa. Enlarged giilar scales iu'esi'iit. 
b. Nares -withiu canthus rostralis. 

Horus shorter; tail less depressed, with coarse lateral fringe; median 

dorsal scales irregular; cross-spotted J. platyrhina Girard. 

Horns longer; tail flattened, with fine lateral fringe; median dorsal 
scales in two parallel rows; a median brown dorsal stripe, no cross 
hars A. maccallii Hallo well. 

The last-named three species resemble ea(;h other more nearly than 
they do the A. modesta. They agree in having the spinous scale with 
its basal circle above the humerus more conspicuously developed, and 
in the enlargement of those scales of the head posterior to the parietal. 
The lateral scales of the digits are also more elongate and i^romiuent. 
Their femoral pores are at the margin of the large scale, the smaller 
posterior ones forming a half rosette. In the .1. modcsta they are 
mostly pierced within the border of the large scale, and rarely in a 
rosette.

The smallest of the species. Head broadly rounded; muzzle very 
obtuse, the profile descending steeply from a transverse angle above 
the nostrils. Temporal regions expanded, supporting a series of acumi-

uate tubeicles from below the trout of the orbit, of which the posterior 
only is distinctly a horn. It is directed posteriorly, having usually the 
same direction and length of the occipital. One short acute occipital 
horn on each side; nointeroccipital. Posterior superciliary plate angu- 
lar, but not promiuent. Infralabials increasing regularly in size to the 
posterior, which are not very prominent. Gular scales equal. A strong 
prehumeral fold, in front of which is a fossa, and in front of this a 
semicircular fold convex backward with a few larger tubercles on its 
border. Cephalic scales rugose with points and ridges. Supraorbitals 
partly separated by a single row of scales. Central supraoculars equal 
supraorbitals. Anterior and posterior superciliaries separated by two 
scales. 

Dorsal scales of irregular sizes, the median keeled. On each side of 
the middle line four rows of widely separated transversely oval scales, 
with a longitudinal keel and apex slightly raised above the general 
level, and with a few large scales (smaller than those just mentioned) 
at their bases, which do not form complete annuli. These large scales 
alternate in their respective rows, though not regularly, and a few flat 
scales of intermediate size are scattered between them. Scales of 
superior surfaces of limbs of irregular sizes, keeled, and larger than 
those of inferior surfaces, which are smooth except on the tibia, where 
they are keeled. Scales of inferior surfaces of head and body smooth. 

The hind limb appressed to the side reaches to or nearly to the 
shoulder. The tail is swollen at the base and then contracts abruptly, 
the remainder being slender and compressed cylindric. Its pholido- 
sis is irregular, but it has no lateral fringe. Femoral pores forming a 
continuous series across the belly, and numbering from ten to twelve on 
each side of the middle line. 

Measnreme^its (Cat. No. 8316). — Total length, 95 mm.; length to vent, 
55 mm.; length to gular fold, 15 mm.; length of head above to end of 
occipital horn, 18.5 mm. ; length of head above base of occipital horn, 
13.5 mm. ; greatest temporal width of head, 21 mm. ; length of fore leg, 
29 mm.; length of fore foot, 10 mm.; length of hind leg, 35 mm; length 
of hind foot, 15 mm. 

In life the color of this species is a light yellowish brown, sometimes 
with a shade of pink. A blackish spot begins on each side of the 
nape and extends round to a point anterior to the humerus. There is 
sometimes a sooty shade on each side from the middle to the groin. A 
small blackish spot behind the vent on the middle line, and frequently 
a similar spot on each side of the anterior border of the vent. There 
are no dorsal spots or crossbais, but the tail is indistinctly annulate 
with blackish. Under surfaces pale yellowish, immaculate, except the 
gular region, which is generally indistinctly dusky spotted. 

This small species ranges from western Texas to Arizona and Chi- 
huahua, inclusive. General Pope sent it from the head waters of the 
Colorado, on the eastern side of the Llano Estacado, and I traced it

from this [)oiiit as far north as (Jhirendon, which is on the licad waters 
of the Red River. L found it common in southwestern Kew INIexico, 
and Potts obtained it from soutli of the city of Cliihuahua. Its western 
limit has not been ascertained. 

In Its habits this species resembles other horned lizards, delighting 
in bright sunshine, in diy and rocky ground, and in eiuleavoring to 
l)rotect itself with its sharp horns when caught.

the grouud scales are smaller, flat, and nut keeled. Tliey are inter- 
rupted by a few keeled scales. Besides these there is a number of rows 
of larger keeled scales, wliich are free ]>osteriorly and are surrounded 
by a rosette at the l)ase. The least i)r()miueut are those near the mid- 
dle line; Just external to these are the largest. They diminish in size 
toward tlie lateral borders. There are large keeled scales on the 
shoulder. This tract divides, the wider baud extending on the jiosterior 
face of the humerus; the narrower, only one scale wide, extending on 
the anterior side io the elbow. The scales of the external side are of 
mixed sizes, and are larger than those of the internal side. The s(;ales 
of the external face of the femur and tibia are like those of the dorsal 
region. Tail subround, bordered by a fringe of rather widely spaced 
conic scales. 

Head scales moderately rough, tending to i)resent a single tubercle 
larger than the others ; scales of inferior surfaces smooth. The extended 
bind leg reaches to the humerus. Femoral ])ores G-8, in a rosette.

This species is nearest to the A. platyrhina Girard, from which it 
differs in various respects. The general i)roportions of all the parts 
and the colorntion are about as in that species, the difference chiefly 
appearing in the squamation and the horns. The scales of the head are 
much more subdivided, and the presence of accessory horns is unique in 
the genus. The simplicity of the lateral fringe is also characteristic, 
as is also the rndimental character of the rosette on the neck.

pi. II, tig. 3. 

AltUoiigli larger than the A. modesta, this is one of the smaller spe 
cies. The horns are well developed, and the temporal region is 
expanded and produced on each side, resembling in this resi)ect tlu- 
A. maccaUii. Three temporal plates especially prominent, the last 
developed into a horn which equals the occipital in length. Like the 
occipitals they are divergent, and not parallel, as is the case in A. 
modesta. Posterior superciliary angle prominent, but not produced. 
Three last infralabials prominently angulate, the last produced, and

not followed by a spine. On the side of the neck two longitudinal 
folds, one above the other, each supporting a row of spinous scales. 
Muzzle concavely truncate, descending steeply from a transverse inter- 
preorbital angle Scales of top of head rugose. Supraorbitals partly 
or quite separated by a single row of scales; anterior and posterior 
superciliaries in contact. Gulars subequal. 

Dorsal scales unequal, the lateral smallest, the largest median keeled. 
Five or six rows of distant scales much larger than the rest on each 
side of the median line, their ai)ices moderately prominent. The scales 
of the single row forming the lateral fringe are very prominent and 
acute. Scales of inferior surfaces smooth, except those of the tibia 
and feet, which are keeled; those of the belly about equal to those of

the middle of the back. Tail witU a lateral fringe of pointed scales 
like those of the sides; the pholidosis of the superior surface irregular 
but without spines. 

The extended hind limb reaches nearly to the posterior border of the 
orbit. The fifth toe equals or is shorter than the first. Femoral pores 
8-10, not extended across the belly. Tail tapering, de^jressed through- 
out, 2.5 times as long as head to base of occipital horns. 

Measurements (Cat. No. 85G7). — Total length, 115 mm. ; length to vent, 
12 mm.; length to gular fold, IS mm.; length to end of occipital horn, 
20 mm.; length to base of occipital horn, W mm.; width at temporal 
horns, 22 mm.; length of fore leg, 30 mm.; length of fore foot, 12 mm.; 
length of hind leg, 47 mm.; length of hind foot, 19 mm. 

In alcohol this species is graj' above and white below. A blackish 
spot on each side of the nape, and three pairs of blackish spots about 
the bases of the large scales on the dorsal region. On each side of 
these the large scales have a blackish shade at the base, forming a 
chain like row of s[)ots parallel with the convex lateral outline. Tail 
with dusky cross lines above. Inferior surfaces immaculate. 

But two specimens of this species are known, and these, in accordance 
with their desert habitat, are of pallid colors. It is related most nearly to 
the A. maccallii, and may be distinguished by the absence of the large 
row of lateral gular scales, the more expanded temporal region, the rela- 
tively shorter horns, and the generally more slender jiroportions,

at temporal spines, 21 mm.; length of fore leg, 35 mm.; length of fore 
foot, 16 mm.; leugtli of hind leg, 48 mm.; length of hind foot, 20 mm. 

In life the ground color of the dorsal region is a ])inkish gray or 
grayish cream color, and this is marked with blackish, as follows: A 
large spot on each side of the nape, which may or may not be fused 
near the occiput, and which do not reach the humeri. From three to 
five chevrons directed posteriorly along the lines of the larger scales, 
well defined posteriorly only, and with the external extremities turned 
backward. These marks may become obsolt te on the posterior part 
of the back, especially in old animals. Limbs distantly, tail rather 
closely, cross banded with dusky. Inferior surfaces immaculate cream 
color, with sometimes a few dusky specks posteriorly and on the femora. 
The head above yellowish or reddish brown and without color marks. 

There is sometimes a shallow fissure in the scaling in the position of 
the tympanic membrane in this species, but I have never seen that 
membrane exposed in even a rudimentary manner. This may, how- 
ever, rarely be the case, but no specimen has been seen, so far as I am 
aware, with a distinct tympanic disk. 

This is the Great liasiu horned lizard, and is not found outside of its 
limits. It ranges from southeastern California to northern Nevada and 
southern Idaho. From the latter State Dr. J. L. Wortinan sent mo a 
specimen from the Bruneau River. I found it abundant near Pyramid 
Lake, Nevada, and at the west foot of the San Iraucisco Mountains, 
in southwestern Utah. Its <'olors are the most pleasing in the genus. 

The stomach of an individual i'rom northwestern Nevada was filled 
with bodies and fragments of the large red ant which abounds in that 
region, which Dr. McCook identifies as the Pogonomyrmex occidcntalis. 
Besides these there was a grasshopi)er, a rentntoma-\\ke hemipter, a 
small beetle, and several insect larvjc. The ant is evidently its princi- 
pal food, and there is no scarcity of them in that arid region. Tlieir 
sting is very severe, and the Anota must be proof against it to a degree 
much superior to that possessed by the (to him) gigantic mammal, man. 

Dr. Stejneger remarks of this species as observed by the Death Val- 
ley exploring expedition : 

Anota plat jirhina inhabits the Lower Sonorau deserts of the Great Basin from Cali- 
fornia to Utah and ranges up a sliort distantte into the Upper Sonoran. lu Califctruia 
it Avas found in greater or less abundance in the Mohave Desert, in Owens, Coso, 
Panainiut, Death, Jlesquite, and Deep Spring valleys, and in the Argus, Funeral, 
and Panamint mountains (up to 1,740 meters or 5,700 feet on west slope northwest 
of Wild Rose Sjjring). In Nevada it was abundant in Sarcobatus Flat, the Amar- 
gosa Desert, Ash Meadows. Indian Spring, Fahrunip, Yegas, Pahranagat, and Meadow 
Creek valleys, and the valley of the Virgin and IVIuddy. In the northwestern cor- 
ner of Arizona it was very abundant about the mouth of Beavcrdam Creek and 
thence up on the west slope of the Beaverdam Mountains. In Utah it was common 
in the Santa Clara Valley ranging up through the sage brush to Diamond Valley 
and Mountain Meadows. 

At Ash Meadows in the Amargosa Desert a very white form was found liviu"- on 
the white alkali soil.

Of this rare species, since the discovery of tbe type, the U. S. National 
Museum has received a male, a female, and a young one from the Colo- 
rado Desert of southeastern California. It is a very distinct species, 
and is so far known from a limited range only. 

There are two lateral series of spiniform scales, of which the inferior 
is shorter at both extremities than the superior, the latter extendiug 
about three-quarters the length from the axilla to the groin. The 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 449 

enlarged lateral giilar .scales are not very conspicuous, and form a short 
series. The occipital liorns are long and acute. The internal temporals 
are half as long, and the external temporals are as long as the internal. 
They are directed nearly transver.sely, while the internal temporals are 
directed at an angle of 45°, and the occipitals more nearly i)osteriorly. 
The tail is broad and flat, and i.s bordered on each side by a fringe of 
rather closely placed spinous scales. Femoral pores numerous, in 
undivided scales. ><o accessory horns. Nares anterior. 

The iufralabial scales have anteriorly prominent angles, and are pro- 
duced into short horns posteriorly. The scales of the head arc larger 
than in most other species, and they are obscurely rugose to nearly 
smooth. Tliere are five scales in a transverse row between the cau- 
thals on the anterior frontal angle. Of these the laterals are quite 
small, and the median three larger than in any other species, especially 
those on each side of the median. Supraoculars from two and three in 
a crossrow behind to four in front. Posterior superciliary angle not 
much jiroduced, the penultimate superciliary scale not prominent nor 
even angular. Middle parietal region convex and not separated from 
the temi)oral region by an angle. Superior labials nine and ten to 
below the middle of the eye, forming a serrate border except anteriorly. 
In the temporal series of scales the one adjacent to the external tem- 
l>oral horn is very prominent, and the two anterior to it have apical 
angles. 

The lateral cervical scales which are in line with the enlarged gidars 
(at a considerable distance) are only two or three in number, instead 
of forming the usual series, while the lateral cervical rosette above them 
is represented by a series of five or six large scales with basals. The 
ground scales of the back are flat, smooth, of various sizes, and gener- 
ally broader than long. The eidarged scales are broader than long, 
keeled, and, except to a limited extent in one row, not free ])osteri()rly. 
There is a row of the smaller of the keeled scales on each side of the mid- 
dle line, which is quite regular. The largest scales form a widely spaced 
row just external to the.se. The other keeled scales diminish in size 
exteriuiUy, and they do not form regular rows. They become more 
conic externally. Humerus aiul forearm covered with large keeled 
scales with free apices, except iuferiorly. Scales of femur and tibia 
keeled and of diverse sizes, except on the concealed surfaces, where they 
are smaller, though generally similar. Scales of inferior surfaces 
smooth, except on the thorax, where they are faintly keeled and gradu- 
ate into those of the humerus. 

Extended hind leg reaching the axilla in female, or to the front of the 
humerus in male. Femoral pores 21-21 in the male, 18-17 in the female, 
in undivided scales. In the male there are 3-3 additional pores on an 
adjacent row of scales. Lateral S(!ales of the toes produced, nujst on 
the external sides.

mm.; Avidth of head (greatest), 25 mm.; width of head between super- 
ciliary angles, 13 mm.; width of body at middle, 31 mm. 

The color above is light at^hen, in the male with an orange tinge, 
which was no doubt much more distinct in the living than in the alco- 
holic specimen. A narrow median brown line extends from tbe parietal 
foramen to the rump. On each side of this are two rows of round 
brown spots or ocelli, as they have a pale interior and a brown central 
dot. These form three transverse rows, the anterior behind the axilhe 
and the posterior just anterior to the groin. The four longitudinal 
series are continued on the tail, where they are arranged transversely. 
Horns pale in the female, orange in the male. Head unspotted; limbs 
with obscure cross bands; inferior surfaces unspotted, except a short 
black line at the position of the omphalomeseraic fissure. The colora 
tion is peculiar in the absence of the lateral cervical spots. There is 
no trace in the female, and a faint longitudinal shade well posterior to 
the head only in. the male. 

This peculiar species inhabits the Colorado Desert; it presents the 
usual character of desert species in its well-developed cranial spines. 
The scales, on the other hand, do not display this character, as they are 
less spinous than those of anj^ other species, either of this genus or of 
Phrynosoma.

Petrosal bone produced anterior to anterior semicircular canal, and 
not articulating above with the edge of the parietal. Clavicle expanded 
proximally. Olfactory lobes underarched by frontal bone. Epiptery- 
goid present. Hemipenis calyculate. Teeth pleurodont. 

The visceral characters of this superfamily resemble those of the 
Pachyglossa. There is a colon which mostly i)resents a caecum, but the 
latter I did not find in Sphwrodactyhis. The right lobe of the liver is 
much produced, and the prolongation sends a process backward, Avhich 
1 have only observed elsewhere in the Lacertida'. I found no corpus 
adiposum in Thecadactylus, PhyllodacUjlus, Ooiiatodes, or iSphcvrodac-

notatus I observed the exceptioniU character of a distinct digitifortn 
lobe of the liver on the left side, which partly embraces the stomach. 
There are two families of this superfaniily. 

Vertebra- iirocrelous ; pariotal bones united Eublephakid^e. 

Vertebra' amphicci'lous ; parietal bones separate Gekconid/K. 

These families are found in the warmer regions of both continents. 
The species which they include are of insectivorous habits. I have 
been able to examine the mesenteries in relatively few genera of the 
superfamily. I find the structure to be of the type most frequent in 
the Sauria; that is, a single hepato ventral; a single gastrohepatic; a 
left gastro})ulmouary, and a right hepatic, which embraces the right 
lung. 

This superfamily is most nearly allied to the Diploglossa in its pro- 
duced petrosal and papillose tongue. The form of the petrosal is very 
different, and the underarched frontals are very rare in that group, 
while the expanded clavicles are like those of the Leptoglossa in.

Coronoid bone produced anteriorly and posteriorly on external side 
of ramus. Surangulai' wanting. Angular largely developed exteriorly, 
not interiorly. Splenial elongate; ^leckel's cartilage covered between 
the splenial and internal mental foramina. Premaxillary broad, in 
contact with vomer. Pterygoids not touching sphenoid. Frontal 
arching under olfactory lobes. Parietal bones distinct: attachment of 
occipital segment very open; gomphosis internal. Petrosal with ante- 
rior vertico-obli(iue ring; superior plate produced beyond anterior semi- 
circular canal, forming abutnuMit for columella. Postorbital osseous 
bars incomplete. Tongue i)apillose, no part retractile. 

I have examined the hemii)enis in the genera Thecadactylux, PUitydac- 
ti/liis, J'hyUodactylKs, and (hjmnodavtylus. In these this organ is short 
and wide, approi)riately to the fragility of the tail at a point Just beyond 
the base. It is also more or less deeply divided into two branches. 
The entire surface is calyculate, generally minutely. In Thecadaciylns 
each fork has three strong welts. In PlatydactyJus there is a welt 
opposite the sulcus, which is very large in /'. (vgyptiavm, and divides,

sending a half iuto each branch, lu Gymnodactylus pulchellus the welts 
are not so heavy; below the bifurcation is a welt which incloses a cir- 
cular area, which is incomplete proximad. 

Boulenger gives the following interesting general account of this 
family : 

The skull i^ generally much depressed, and its bones are thin. The nasals remain 
distinct; the frontal is either single or with distinct suture; the jugal is rudimen- 
tary, the orbit not being bound posteriorly by a bony arch ; the supratemporal arch 
is likewise absent; the i)terygoids are widely separated and devoid of teeth, aud 
columella crauii is present. The mandible contains only live bones, the angular 
and articular being coalesced; the dentition belongs to the pleurodont type; the 
teeth are small, numerous, closely set, with long, slendir, cylindrical shaft and 
obtuse i^oint; the new teeth hollow out the base of the old ones. Only in a few 
instances does the derm of the head coalesce with the skull, and a supraorbital bone 
is present only in a few species of Tarentola. Both pairs of limbs are constautly 
well developed and pentadactyle. The clavicle is dilated and perforated proxi- 
mally, and the interclavicle is subrhomboidal, or of a shape intermediate between 
that and the cruciform. The vertebne are biconcave; the ribs are long, aud so pro- 
longed as to form more or less ossified hoops across the whole of the abdominal 
region. 

The digits vary considerably, and afford excellent characters for systematic 
arrangement. Some Geckos (living in barren regions) have the digits similar to 
those of many Agamoids, i. e., they are subcylindi-ical or feebly depressed, aud fre- 
quently keeled iuferiorly or denticulated laterally ; other forms with uondilateil digits 
have them angularly bent at the articulations and provided with strong claws; but 
the greater number have the whole or part of the digits dilated into adhesive organs 
with symmetrical plates or lamelhe iuferiorly, the arrangement of which varies con- 
siderably. Then, also, the claw may be retractile, either between some of the 
lamelhe or into a special sheath. Membranes may unite the digits, but the web 
serves only for the purpose of obtaining a greater adhesive surface, and never for 
swimming, none of the Geckos entering the water. 

The body is generally more or less depressed, aud may be bordered by cutaneous 
expansions, the object of which appears to be, in most cases, the same as that of the 
iuterdigital membrane; but in the curious genus I'tycliozoon, in which the lateral 
membranes attain the greatest development, they act as a ])arachute. The tail pre- 
sents almost every possible shape from the leaf-like tail of Gymnodactyhis platnrus 
aud the grotesque rudimentary tail of Xephrarns to the slender, rat-like tail of 
Agamura and the compressed crested tail of Pristurus. This organ is, except in 
Agamura, extremely fragile and rapidly reproduced, in which case, however, it gen- 
erally assumes an abnormal shape and lepidosis. In some forms the tail proves to 
be prehensile, a faculty which is i)0ssessed by few lizards other than the Chameleons; 
and I am induced to believe that a careful examination of the Geckos, when alive, 
will show this character to be not unfrequent. 

The eye is generally large and with vertical pupil, which, when contracted 
strongly, is frequently denticulated or assumes the shape of two superposed rhombs; 
some diurnal forms have the eye smaller aud the pupil circular. The eye is exposed 
as ill snakes, covered by a transparent lid under which it moves freely, the valvular 
lids being rudimentary; in ^FAnrosaurns, however, there are connivent movable 
lids, and in Ptenopus the upper lid is sufficiently developed to cover the eye nearly 
completely. 

Ihe tympanum is more or less exposed, except in Teratolepia, in which genus it 
appears to be completely concealed under tlie scales. The tongue is fleshy, moder- 
ately elongate, very feebly incised anteriorly, and capable of protrusion out of the 
mouth. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND HNAKES. 453 

The teguments are nearly always soft and consist generally of granules or tuber- 
cules on the dorsal surface, of small imbricated cycloid or hexagonal scales on the 
ventral surface. Some Geckos are entirely covered with scales of the latter descrip- 
tion, which attain their highest development in Teratoscincua, Teratolepis, and 
Gevkolepifi. 

The habits of the Geckos are highly interesting and deserve special atteution, as 
butfew observations have been made on them. Some inhabit arid regions, sometimes 
burrowing in the sand; others are arboreal, living on shrubs or in woods, concealing 
themselves under stones or under the bark of trees during the daytime; others live 
on rocks; others have become the commensals of man, and they again may be divided 
into two groups — those living inside, those living outside houses. Most are noc- 
turnal, but some are diurnal. Colonel Tytler, in a very interesting paper on the 
habits of Geckos, observes that, "although several species of Geckos may inhaltit 
the same locality, yet, as a general rule, they keep sejiarate and aloof from each 
other; for instance, in a house the dark cellars may be the resort of one species, the 
roof of another, and crevices in a wall may be exclusively occupied by a third 
species. However, at night they issue forth in quest of insects, and may be found 
mixed up together in the same spot; but on the slightest disturbance, or when they 
have done f(;ediug, they return hurriedly to their particular hiding places."' 

Many Geckos utter sounds, probably produced chiefly by a movement of the 
tongue against the palate, and in which yecko, chuvko, fockee. or something similar is 
distinctly audible. A. Smith says that a South-African sand Gecko (Ptenoptis 
garruhis) utters during the day a sharp sound somewhat like chick, chick; and he 
adds that the number thus occupied is at times so great, and the noise so disagree- 
able, as to cause the traveler to change his quarters. 

The eggs are round and with a hard shell. Ovoviviparism has not been observed 
in this family. Males are generally distinguished from females by a larger si/e, the 
swelling of the base of the tail, and the presence of femoral or pra-anal pores, which 
are constantly absent in the latter. 

The Geckonidie are represented in the hotter parts of all the regions of the world. 
They are most numerous in the Indian and Australian regions.

southeast, the former from the Mexican district and the latter from the 
West Indian district of the Neotropical llealm.

Digits all dilated at their extremity into a disk, which is perfectly 
smooth beneath, with a median furrow, all provided with distinct claws. 

The phyllodactyles are easily known by the smoothness below of 
their digital disks and the distinct claws. Other characters, according 
to Dnnu'ril and Bibron, are the vertical pupil, the nostrils flared at the 
extremity of the snout, no second range of plates bordering the lower 
labials; the digits with transverse divisions beneath, posterior to the 
dilated portion. 

O^teoloyy. — In their osteology the species of this genus conform 
strictly to the Geckonid type as already described. I have before me 
the skeleton of P. tubercuJosus, from which the following description is 
derived: The pi-emaxillary is single and has a long superior spine; 
inferiorly it has the posterior border emarginate. Nasals elongate, dis- 
tinct, emargiuate posteriorly for the frontal. Frontal single, rather 
narrow, completely underarching olfactory lobes. Parietals distinct, 
wide, without pineal foramen, lying rather closely on sui)raoccipital, 
sending backward the parietoquadrate arch, which incloses a small 
foramen with the exoccipital. Supraoccipital distinguished fiom exoc- 
cipital by suture. Prefrontal narrow, forming thepreorbital border to 
the middle above; no lachrymal; jugal represented by a splint which 
extends from the prefrontal to the extremity of the maxillary on the 
superior surface of the latter. Postfrontal a rather wide V-shaped bone, 
its longest limb extending posteriorly more than halfway to the base 
of the parietoquadrate arch. No postorbital. Quadrate with a single 
large, concave, external conch. Paroccipital in the usual position, 
splint-like. 

Vomers in close contact throughout, with a common convex posterior 
border; an external longitudinal convexity of the inferior surface, and 
a groove on each side of the median suture, which divides a keel. Pala- 
tines short and wide, and with a longer vomerine than maxillary proc- 
ess, and curving downward below the level of the vomers. Narial 
orifices fissure-like except posteriorly and anteriorly, the external bor- 
der with a dentate process of the maxillary bone directed posteriorly near 
the middle. Pterygoids much exj^anded anteriorly, forming with the 
ectopterygoids and palatines a thin plate, which closes up the palatine 
foramen; contracting rather rapidly posteriorly to the subcylindric rod- 



CROCODILIAXS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 457 

like portion. Epipterygoid extending from the pterygoid at the basi- 
pterygoid process, and resting on tbe apex of the petrosal. Latter 
produced above anterior to semicircular canal; tbe anterior border con- 
tinued into a crest which runs posteriorly above tbe trigeminal foramen. 
This terminates at the down-looking crest of the subforaminal portion, 
which bounds externally a wide down-looking groove. Basipterygoid 
j)ro(;esses long. Sphenoid distinct from basioccipital. Occipital con- 
dyle subequally divided into three parts, two prominent exoccipitals 
and a contracted basioccipital. The result is an apparently double 
condyle. 

Mandible with the Meckelian groove closed, and with the splenial 
small and but little produced beyond the splenial foramen. Coronoid 
produced a little horizontally at the base. Angular not distinct; surau- 
gular and articular distinct. Angle simple, direct, spoon-shaped, with 
superior concavity. 1 have observed the following peculiarities in the 
otic and hyoid regions. There is no infrastapedial cartilage, and the 
suprastapedial and epistapedial cartilages are continuous. The hyoid 
system is characterized by the fact that the ceratohyal is attached to 
the paroccipital, which carries a cartilage on its extremity. There is a 
short second ceratobranchial, and no free epibranchial. 

Vertebra' amphicoelous, Intercentra present throughout the verte- 
bral column, continued into chevrons on the caudal region. Cervical 
ribs widened and truncate at extremities. In the specimen described 
the diapophyses of the second sacral vertebra are deeply longitudinally 
grooved on the inferior side so as to be nearly split. Diapophyses of 
anterior caudals elongate. Neural spines distin(;t but low throughout 
the column. In the scapular arch I note the following peculiarities. 
There is no proscapula, and the clavicle is much enlarged, and is per- 
forate at the median extremity. The interclavicle is cruciform, with the 
angles tilled up so as to have concave borders. It is coossified with the 
clavicle in P. tuberculatus, and extends but a little way posteriorly on 
tbe sternum. The coracoid has one large foramen. The sternum has 
no fontanelle. There are four luemapophyses attached to the sternum 
on each side; and two to each of the slender closely approximated 
xiphoid rods. There are several very slender abdominal ribs. 

The ilium has no angulns crista; and the acetabulum is entire. The 
pubes join at a little less than a right angle, and the jtectineal processes 
are short and a little posterior to the middle. Pubes uniting at less 
than a right angle below, with the tuberosities distal. 

The most distinctive feature of the skeleton of this genus is the pres- 
ence of intercentra throughout the vertebral column, a point in which 
it resembles the extinct Theromora of the Permian epoch.

species from Africa and Madagascar, five from Australia and adjacent 
islands, and one from the islands of the Mediterranean Sea west of 
Italy. P. galapagomsis and P. leei are natives of the Galapagos

The nostril is situated in tlie middle of one ])late Avith a narrow rim, 
wliicli is encircled by live others, instead of being a mere pit between 
in the angle of four plates, one of them the first labial. The scales are 
in\u'h finer on the back and coarser on the belly. The liinl)S are shorter. 
The central line of scales beneath the toes is wider and less angular. 
The hook on tlie side of the base of the tail is represented in the type 
by numerous smaller scales. Above, light brownish or reddish yellow, 
with a series of transverse blotches of darker on each side (about eight 
or ten). A few seen on the tail. Beneath, uniform whitish. 

Head and body much depressed; the neck somewhat contracted. 
The ears are small and cresceutic. The eyes are very large; the eye- 
lids annular and apparently not capable of covering the eye. The 
bony ring of the sclerotica is composed of many plates, as in birds. The 
nostrils are small, very far forward, 
and situated so close to the low ros- 
tral as to appear partly excavated in 
it. Thej^ are placed just above the 
junction of the rostral and first labial, 
with ten plates between them and 
touching the rostral. Behind them 
and against these internasals is an- 
otlier plate, smaller than the latter; 
another tubercular plate still smaller 
and lil<e the others behind it com- 
pletes the border. The head is in- 
jured so that the labial plates can 
not be readily distinguished, but 
there are apparently eight or nine up- 
per, the posterior becoming smaller 
and four or five lower, becoming- 
smaller behind and then changing to 
a double series of tubercles. The 
end of the lower jaw is formed by 

a large, long i)late, acutely angular behind, with a large subpentagonal 
arc between it and the first labial. Behind this the plates become 
subhexagonal and diminish gradually in size to the general average, 
occupying a patch extending as far as opi)Osite the fourth lower labial 
and bordered behind and laterally by small plates. Those 'bordering 
the lower labials are not much larger than those on the back part of the 
chin, similar ones covering the upper part of the head, as far as to the 
posterior borders of the orbit. The rest of the head above, the back 
and sides, witli the throat, are covered with small, approximated gran- 
ules, with much larger conical or trihedral ones interspersed. Of these 
the back exhibits about ten regular series, five large ones on each side 
of the median line, with an additional row of smaller ones on each flank. 
The belly is comi)letely and regularly covered with smooth subhexago- 
nal scales arranged in (piincunx, although but little imbricated. Of

these there are about 31 or 32 in au oblique series across the belly. 
They extend from the throat to the tail and quite similar ones are to be 
seen on the entire inferior surface of the hind legs and the anterior of 
the front legs; the latter more convex. 

The upper surfaces of the legs are like the back, but the tubercles 
are less regular. The posterior face of the arm and femur over the 
sides, except above, are covered with uniform small scales, those on the 
femur being abruptly smaller behind than inferiorly. 

The legs are short, the hinder especially. The digits are all nearly 
equal, increasing in length from the first to the third, which is about 
equal to the fourth and fifth. They are connected at the base by a 
web. They are depressed, their under surface with a series of short, 
transverse, rather tubercular lamell;^, and they terminate in a flattened 
obcordate or subquadrate expansion, which is perfectly smooth and flat 
beneath, with'a central longitudinal groove, and emarginate or cordate 
at the end, to receive the point of the sharp, apparently retractile, claw. 

The tail is cylindrical, thickened, but attenuated at the end, and not 
quite as long as the head and body; it is contracted at the base and 
covered pretty regularly with small scales in indistinct whorls, and about 
as large as those on the belly. The under surface, however, is occupied 
by a series of broad transverse plates, beginning a short distance 
behind the anus. On the upper surface, too, are four rows of the large 
tubercles, continued from the arch, on as many slight ridges, separated 
by furrows, the central of which is the largest. The tubercles of each 
series are separated by an interval of about three of the smaller scales. 
On each side the base of the tail and above the anus is an oblique series 
of three spinous tubercles. There are two exposed cavities behind the 
anus (containing the penes?), but there are no femoral or preanal pores. 

This specimen sufficiently resembles the species described by Wieg- 
mann to belong to it, except that the ventral scales are smooth, not 
carinated, and uniform, not mixed with smaller ones.

the pupil; six inferior, to the same point, the last two very small, the 
first larger than the second, extensively in conta(;t with the first pair 
of mental plates, which bound the symphyseal posteriorly. Each of 
the former is bounded by tlirec smaller, and these are succeeded by a 
few rows which diminish in size. Terminal disks with straight outlines.

Mr. Van Denburgh,' of San Fran- 
cisco, who has seen more specimens 
of this species than any other per- 
son, thus writes of the variations in 
its coloration : 

There is great variation iu the colora- 
tion of the bead and back. In some speci- 
mens it is pale gray or <ieain.y white, 
while in others the prevailing tint is a dark 
seal-brown. There are, however, some 
fairly constant markings brighter in 
young than iu old individuals, but appar- 
ently subject like the ground cok)r, though 
to a less extent, to moditication, in accord- 
ance with the amount of light, or perhaps 
in obedience to the will of the animal. 
These markings are of a deeper seal-brown 
than the ground color of the darkest indi- 
viduals. A line originates on the second labial plate and, passing through the eye 
and the upper ear-opcniug, runs for some distance along the neck. The upper surface 
of the head is blotched and spotted, as are also the limbs. The tail has about nine 
crossbars on its upper surface. All the lower surfaces are creamy white, slightly 
tinged with brown iu the darkest specimens. The scales are everywhere minutely 
punctnlated over with dark brpwn.

Digits subcylindrical, without claws; expanded at their extremity 
into subcircular pads; smooth, and not grooved beneath. 

The Spha^rodactyles are easily distinguished from the Phyllodactyles 
by the absence of any median groove on the surface of the terminal 
disks of the digits. They differ in other points of organization, though 
more nearly related to them thau to the other Geckonidas 

The species described by Dumeril and Bibron all appear to have the 
scales of the dorsal surface small, granular, or else with those along 
the middle of back smaller than the layer on either side. The single 
one inhabiting the United States (Key West), on the contrary, has the 
scales of the upper surface large, equal, strongly carinated, and larger 
than the ventral. The S. richardsonii of Gray has the same character, 
but differs in coloration.

Scales on back and sides large, equal, strongly carinated and acute; 
those* on belly rather smaller, smooth, hexagonal. Tail cylindrical. 
The head is about half the body alone; the tail equal to both together. 
The hind leg is contained about two and two-thirds times in head and 
body; the hind foot about times. The upper parts are light-brownish 
yellow, covered ratber distantly, but cpiite uniformly, with small circnlar 
spots of reddish brown, conspicuously so on the whole head ; scarcely 
seen on the belly; on the breast they almost seem arranged in regular 
lines. Head broad and acutely pointed, depressed; width about two- 
thirds the length to ear. Rostral consisting of a large triangular plate 
forming the entire end of the muzzle. The nostril opening in its 
po.sterior margin over the junction of the first labial, bordered above 
by a slight shell. Behind the rostral are two triangular plates meeting 
internally by an acute angle, and coming by the antero-exterior angle 
in contact with the lateial rostral. There are three large upper labials, 
the first largest, the second between this and the third; posteriorly 
are two or three much smaller. There is a very large mental plate like 
the rostral, and forming the end of the jaw; on each side of this is one 
very large lower labial corresponding to the first and second upper; 
then two smaller ones. There ate no ])lates under the lower labials 
larger than those on the chin. There is a shallow depression in the

hinder part ul' the rostral, divided longitudinally by a sliallow groove, 
and possibly indicating a fusion with an intcrnasal or nasal plate. The 
eyes are very large and much exposed; the eyelids appear to be 
annular, the lower entering completely within the orbital cavity. The 
ears are very small and circular. 

The head and upper part of neck, except as described, are covered 
with uniform tubercles, which become a little larger anteriorly. The 
upper parts and sides of body are covered with (piite large, imbricated, 
acute, angular, and strongly carinated scales, of which there appear to 
be about thirty across back and sides. On the belly the scales are a 
little smaller, hexagonal, and smooth — about twenty in an oblique 
series. About lifteen ridges maybe counted above between the hind legs. 
The scales in front of the pubes are coarser, thicker, and more tubercular 
than more anteriorly. The scales above and behind the fore leg, on the 
side of the neck, in front of the hind leg, and on the posterior face of

fore leg and of thigh are small, even, and granular, like those back of 
the head. The upper and outer surfaces of the legs are covered Avith 
large, acute, carinated scales. The tail is cylindrical, as long as body 
(alive), constricted at base, and finely whorled, the scales in under sur- 
face broader. There are no pores about the anus nor spines at the 
base of tail, as far as can be perceived. The legs are short, the digits 
broad, depressed, and without any claws, each one expanded at the end 
into a plain circular snbliemispherical depressed pad, plane on the 
under surface; the digits anterior to this transversely lamellated. 

This species iu its large and strongly carinated scales, about of equal 
size, differs widely from all those described by Dunn-ril and Bibron, but 
approaches the >S. richardsoitii of Gray.' The colors, however, are 
entirely different. 

Specimens from Chiba collected by Charles Wright are very similar 
in character generally, but appear to have a more slender head and

more obtuse muzzle, with larger plates above it. The coloration is the 
same in some, but in others the head. There is a dusky line along the 
top of head, and three from behind the eye, a middle one, broadest, 
passing above the ear, an inferior passing below it, and a short one 
above the rest. The line on top of the head bifurcates at the occiput 
and with the others is continued indistinctly along the body. There is 
also a line from nose to eye.

Except in the procoelian vertebrie and the single parietal bone, the 
skeleton is similar to that of the preceding family, to which the Euble- 
pharid;e are affined. The teguments are also very similar, and of a soft 
kind, the upper surfaces are covered with small scales or granules, 
which are usually intermixed with enlarged tubercles, and the lower 
surface of the body with small cycloid imbricated scales. The skin 
of the head is free from the skull. The eyes are moderately large, 
with elliptico-vertical pupil, and are protected by thick, movable, con- 
nivent lids. The nostril is rather large, directed slightly upward, 
though lateral, and separated from the rostral and labial ijlates. The 
tympanum is exposed. The limbs are weak and the digits short and 
cylindrical; they are all provided with a small, sharp, retractile claw 
which, in Coleonyx, is entirely concealed iuamuch-developed, compressed 
sheath; this sheath, which differs only in size according to the genera, 
is composed of two lateral plates, the superior suture of which is cov- 
ered by a third narrower one, a structure which we have already met 
with in the Geckoid geuus ^^luroscvurus. As in the Geckos, the tail is 
extremely fragile. Males have preanal pores, forming an angular series. 

Three species are natives of Central America, one of the southern 
parts of the United States, two of southern Asia, and one of West 
Africa; the genus Euhlepharis occurs in America as well as in Asia. 
This extraordinary distribution seems to indicate that the few repre- 
sentatives of this small family are the remnants of some ancient, more 
generally dispersed group; it nevertheless remains a matter of wonder 
how forms now so widely separated have retained so great a resem- 
blance, not only in structure but also in the pattern of coloration.

Belly covered with regular small hexagonal scales; rest of body and 
head (except on edges of mouth) covered with small regular granules, 
sometimes mixed with larger scales. Jaws each margined with a single 
series of labial plates, the granules maigining these a little larger. 
Eyelids much developed; pupil vertical. External ear distinct. A 
short spine at each side of the base of the tail. Tail cylindrical all 
round, with very short whorls of small square plates constricted at base. 
Digits conical, not dilated; denticulated along the edges beneath with 
two or three series of transverse tubercles, the central largest and 
lamellar. Claws very small, not retractile, partially concealed by two 
lateral and one superior scale. First digit not opposable to the others. 
No crests or folds of skin. Skin of body very loose. Xo palatine teeth. 
Jaw teeth straight, conical-truncate, and pleurodont. Hind feet shorter 
than tibia. Male with i)reanal pores. 

Dr. Bouleuger' distinguishes the E. elef/ans Gray, of Mexico and 
Central America, as the type of a distinct genus Coleonyx, following 
Gray, on the ground that the claws are completely concealed in the 
latter. I find the characters of the E. elegans and the E. varietjatus 
to be identical in this respect, and so can not separate them generically. 

Anatomi/. — Owing to the isolated i)osition of this genus, its osteology 
is worthy of especial attention. The premaxillary is undivided, and 
has a long superior spine, but no inferior spine. The nasals are distinct. 
Tlie frontals are coossifled, and the interorbital space is very narrow. 
The parietals are coossilicd, and there is no pineal foramen. The 
supraoccipital is loosely articulated anteriorly, but is coossified with 
theexoccipitals. No lachrymal bone; prefrontal large, but not reaching 
far posteriorly over orbit. Postfrontal small, crescentic ; no postorbital. 
No postorbital or supratemporal arches. Parietoquadrate arch de-

pressed; paroccipital lying over the i)arietal at tlie inferior extremity. 
Nojugal bone. No orbitosplienoid; the olfactory lobes inclosed below 
by the frontal bone. Petrosal produced beyond semicircularcanalatthe 
superior anterior angle, and without the oblique crest such as is char- 
acteristic of the Geckonidfe. A subforaminal projection and groove, 
the external wall of the groove as prominent downward as the internal, 
so that the groove is open interiorly. Vomers swollen, separated for 
most of their length by a deep groove. Palatines short and wide, 
sending a postnarial process to the maxillary. Pterygoids broad and 
flat in front, narrower i)osteriorly, with a short ectopterygoid Avithotit 
descending angle, inclosing a maxillopalatine foramen. Basipterygoids 
elongate. Sphenoid and basioccipital distinct; the latter distinct also 
from exoccipitals. Occijiital condyle convex, without exoccipital por- 
tion. Epipterygoid oblique, articulating below posterior to ectoptery- 
goid process of pterygoid and above with petrosal only. Quadrate 
straight, oblique, with a single conch, which is external to the rod-like 
axis; condyle euiarginate. In the mandible the angular bone is small 
but distinct, and the coronoid is j)roduced much farther anteriorly 
than posteriorly on the external face of the ramus. The dentary 
extends to about opposite the middle of the coronoid on the external 
face of the ramus. The spleuial extends posteriorly but not anteriorly. 
The Meckelian groove closed. In the hyoid apparatus all the elements 
are x>resent, including a pair of elongate second ceratobranchials. 
There is a free process of the ceratohyal anterior to its junction with 
the hypohyal. 

The scapular arch is much like that of the Geckonidfe. The clavicle 
is expanded and jierforate proximally. The interclavicle is subcruci- 
form, with the limbs connected by laminate expansion. There is a 
small proscapula which is connected at its apex with the epicoracoid. 
Coracoid with one large emargination. Sternum without fontanelle, 
supporting three ribs and a xiphoid rod, which supports but one rib. 
No abdominal ribs. 

The hemipenis is closely similar to that of the Geckonida*. It is short 
and deeply bifurcate. It has a single i)rominent welt. The surface of 
this is smooth, but the remainder of the surface is calyculate.

rostrum with a few brown blotches. Edges of eyelids and whole under 
surfaces opaque white. 

Body everywhere ^except on the belly) covered with perfectly uni- 
form, excessivelj^ minute, rounded tubercles or granular scales, much 
too small to be appreciable hy the naked eye; they are, however, rather 
suialler on the head all round. The lateral granules change gradually 
on the belly to rhombic, imbricated, cariiiated scales, arranged regularly 
in quiiu'unx and Itecoming a little larger to the center. They begin on 
the lower part of the throat and cover the under surface of the hind 
legs: th.ey are a little larger than elsewhere between the insertion of 
the hijul legs. The tail is occupied by a succession of short whorls of 
nearly eipial square scales as large as those on the belly, the inferior 
ones largest. The ear opens abruptly as an oval deep cavity. There 
are no palatine teeth. The 
only plates on the head 
consist of those margining 
tbe jaws, consisting of a 
large, nearly equal rostral 
and mental and about 
labials (upper and lower 
each ), the posterior smaller. 
These are margined by 
scales rather larger than 
the average of those on 
the head. The annular 
nostril is in the center of a 
sujall plate with narrow 
edges, placed above the 
junction of the rostral and 
the first labial. It is mar- 
gined behind by two rather 
square i)lates, and anteri- 
orly hy a long, narrow one 
api)lied against the rostral. The orbits are large, the eyelids Nery full, 
continuous, and uniform with the supra- and infraorbital region. Each 
has a series of narrow quadrate i)lates on its edge. 

The toes have no lateral pallets, but are conical, tapering to the 
claws, although depressed and slightly denticulated laterally. Beneath 
they are covered with transverse tubercles arranged in two or three 
longitudiiml series, the central widest. The claws are very small, 
quite straight, slender, and apparently not retractile; they are scarcely 
visible in a sheath of scales. The fingers are long and nearly eijual, 
the first and fifth reaching opposite the same point — the penultimate 
articulation of the third. The fourth toe is longest; the third and 
second successively shorter by about a daw; tlie fifth about eipial to 
the first and much shorter than second. The hind foot is about as long

as the tibia. On each side of the base of the tail is a short depressed 
spine carved a little upward and forward like a spur: and just behind 
the anus, but exterior to it, and almost covered by the anal flap, are 
two quite large ones, frilled with a membranous substance. 

A second series of specimens (Cat. No. 3213), probably the males of the 
preceding, from Camp Yuma, differs from that just described' in having 
a series of well-defined preanal pores in the centers of six or seven large 
circular scales between the centers of insertion of hind legs. The pits 
behind the anus appear tilled with erectile tissue, probably the penis, 
as the space behind is much swollen or subglobular, with a median 
longitndinal depression and a deep constriction behind it, beyond 
which the tail with the larger scales begins at a distance of about 
twenty one-hundredths of an inch from the anus. This is very differ- 
ent from the majority of lizards where the tail comes close up to the 
anal slit. 

It may be that the specimens with preanal pores (Cat. No. 3213) are 
really of a different species from the typical ones without them. The 
central row of tubercles beneath the toes is wider and niore transversely 
lamellar tlian in the type specimen. 

The head is large and broad; convex above and ovate; the width 
about two thirds the length. It is contained (from snout to ear) a little 
more than four times in head and body. The hind legs extended for- 
ward twice; reach nearly to the eye, and are contained about two and 
one half times in head and body. The hind foot alone is contained six 
times in head and body. 

The color in Cat. No. 3217 is a light brownish yellow above, with small 
rounded reddish-brown blotches irregularly distributed. The edges of 
the eyelids, the nostrils, the tip of rostral, a spot in front of the orbital 
region, and ten spots on each side of upper jaw are white; tiie rest of 
upper labials and tip of rostrum reddish brown, like the dorsal blotches. 
The under parts are opaque silvery white. 

In another series which appears identical with the preceding, though 
of smaller size, the ground color is brownish yellow, but the back is 
crossed by six or seven broad bars of olivaceous brown, about equal to 
each other and to their interspaces. These are continued on the tail 
as five or six rings interrupted below, tiie borders considerably darker 
than the centers. The most anterior bar covers the whole head behind 
the eye. The anterior portion of the head likewise is quite similar, 
with a U-shaped light mark above the anterior corner of the eye (the 
concavity anterior), a square spot in the rostral and one around and 
behind the nostril. The labials are yellowish, with a dusky spot on 
the end of the lower jaw and another crossing both jaws at about the 
fourth and fifth labials. The chin is slightly blotched.

This very pretty lizard is the only species of the Eublepharidte thus 
far found in Texas. Both the banded and spotted forms occur. I 
found both rather abundant in the rocky hills of the first j)lateau 
northwest of San Antonio, but did not observe it in that region north 
of that point either on the Gnadalupe or Llano rivers. It is found in 
holes under stones toward evening, and generally in pairs — a peculiarity 
I have not observed in any other lizard.' Its manners are also peculiar. 
It carries its thick tail coiled vertically on one side of its back, like the 
spitz dog. Its movements are quick bnt feeble, and its short legs for- 
bid the speed of other lizards. Euhlepharis has large, thick eyelids, 
and as their movement in winking is slower than in other lizards the 
physiognomy is quite peculiar. When handled this species chirrups 
and squeals feebly like a singing mouse. One specimen which I took 
was about to shed its skin, so I i>laced it in ajar to observe the process. 
This took place in the night, for next morning it was so clean and its 
color so bright that it looked as thongh gotten up for some special occa- 
sion. As no trace of the skin could be found, I suppose that it ate it, 
after the manner of the Batrachia. In life the colors are very elegant; 
the pale crossbands are citron yellow and the brown ones bright chest- 
nut. The inferior surfaces and all i)arts of the limbs are flesh or rose 
color.

Geekonidce, part of most authors. 

Uroplatidw Boulenger, Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist. (5), XIV, 1884, p. 119. 

The Ibllowiug description is from Boulenger: 

Tongue moderately elongate, simply papillose, slightly nicked anteriorly. Denti- 
tion strictly ideurodont; teeth numerous, small, obtusely conical, with long cylin- 
drical shafts. No pterygoid teeth. Skull thin, much depressed. A rather strong 
ligamentous postorbital arch; no fronto-squamosal arch; premaxillary single; nasal 
single; frontal single; parietals two. Vertebric amphiccelian ; abdominal ribs. 
Limbs well developed. Clavicles slender, not dilated proximally; interclavicle 
minute. Skin of head free from skull; teguments soft, granular, and tubercular. 

This family contains a single genus, the aberrant Uroplates of Madagascar, which 
combines with a Geckoid structure a peculiar sternal apparatus aud the union of 
the nasal bones. 

This family is allied to the Geckonidae in its separate parietals, amphi- 
ccelous vertcbrse, and reduced postorbital border and bar. The undi- 
lated clavicles, however, justify Bouleuger's separation of it from that 
family, and the fusion of the nasal bones emphasize the distinction. 
It includes but one genus, which is characterized as follows: 
Digits depressed, more or less webbed, with very small equal scales interiorly, the 

extremity strongly dilated, with two diverging series of lamelhs inferiorly ; all 

the digits clawed, the claw retractile in the anterior notch of the distal expansion. 

Body covered with small juxtaposed scales. Pupil vertical. No eyelids. Ear 

opening distinct. No prteanal nor femoral pores Uroplates Gray. 

This genus includes three species, which are confined to Madagascar.

Characters of the skeleton in this family are the following: 

Premaxillary single, in contact with inaxillopalatiiies. Splenial 
bone well developed, MeckeFs groove expo.sed; coronoid prodnced 
anteriorly and not posteriorly on external face of ramus ; angular lit- 
tle developed on inner, much developed on outer side of ramus; den- 
tary not produced posteriorly. Supratemporal fossa not roofed by 
ossitication. Nasal bones coossified. 

The visceral characters of Varanus, the only genus of the family, 
aie unlike those of other genera of lizards. The heart and liver 
occupy a more ijosterior position than usual, the heart being much fur- 
ther posterior to the sternum than any other family, and adjacent to 
the liver. The lungs do not partake in this peculiarity, since they 
begin a considerable distance anterior to the heart and terminate 
opposite the proximal extremity of the liver, instead of lying on either 
side oj that organ and coterminous with it, which is the position in 
other Sauria. 

Tlie trachea bifurcates well cephalad of the lungs, presenting nuich 
longer bronchi than any other type. The aorta roots in like manner 
make their posterior curvature anterior to the usual position. The 
liver is bilobate at both extremities, but the right lobe is much pro- 
duced distally into a striplike process, as in most other Sauria. The 
gall-bladder is on the superior side of the liver within the posterior 
border, and is not visible from below. The aliincntary canal is of mod- 
erate length, and the small intestine is well specialized from the stom- 
ach. There is no dilatation constricted off as a colon. Urinary bladder 
and corpora adiposa present. The latter do not i)roject freely into the 
C(elom, but lie between the peritoneum and the body walls. 

The peritoneal folds have the following distribution: There are two 
gastrohepatio sheets, but the right is much shorter caudad than the 
left. There is no sheet connecting the left lobe of the liver with the 
body wall nor are there any connecting the distal border of the liver 
with either body wall. A sheet, however, connects the right border of 
the liver with the body wall. At the middle of the hepatic border 
this sheet is single, but at the cephalad and caudad extremities it is 
double, producing funnel-shaped sacs which open toward each other. 
Ventral mesentery single, and not extending beyond liver, A strong- 
sheet of peritoneum connects the pericardium with the body wall on 
each side. 

The great ease with which the peritoneum is separated from the 
body walls in Varan us has led authors to make some curious state- 
ments. Thus Giinther says ' that the corpora adiposa are inclosed in a 



'TIio Anatomy o( Reytnia ocellalu, Vtoc. Zool. Soc. Loudon, Febriiary-Manh, 1861. 



472 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

separate sac of the " peritoueum." They occupy the usual position out- 
side of tbe peritoneum, and as they do not project freely into the body 
cavity, can not be «iaid to occupy separate sacs. In lizards where tbey 
do project into the crelom they do occupy iiouches of peritoneum. 
Beddard^ does not regard the ventral i^eritoneum as such, but thiuks 
it to be distinct from it, calling it the " horizontal membrane." But it 
has all the relations of the ventral peritoneum of other lizards, and I 
believe it to be truly such. It is very loosely attached to the muscular 
walls by connective tissue. 

In Varanns salvator the hemipenis is furnished with transverse 
flounces, which are longitudinally ribbed, except at the thin edge. The 
folds form a chevron directed distad. Apex smooth. In V. arenarius 
the apex is smooth, and on the base are longitudinal series of acute 
papillte. In V. grisctis the organ is entirely smooth in a specimen 
examined, but I do not know whether this condition is normal. 

Boulenger remarks of the Varanidae as follows: 

Tongue smooth, A'ery long and slender, bifid, retractile into a sheath at the base. 
Teeth large, dilated at the base, which is fixed to the inner side of the jaws. Pal- 
ate toothless. Premaxillary single, narrowed, and much prolonged posteriorly; 
nasal bones coalesced and narrow; two frontals; a single parietal; a supraorbital 
bone ; postorbital arch incomplete ; a bony supratemporal arch ; pterygoids and pala- 
tines widely separated; infraorbital fossa bounded by the pterygoid, palatine, and 
transvtirse bone, the maxillary being exchided. 

The characters of the genus Varanus are as follows : 

No dermal cranial ossifications; head covered with small polygonal scales. Eyelids 
well developed; ear-opening distinct. Limbs well developed; clavicle slender; 
interclavicle anchor-shaped. Dorsal scales roundish, juxtaposed, surrounded by 
rings of minute granules; ventral scales squarish, arranged in cross rows. No 
femoral or preanal pores. Tongue sheathed at base. Tail very long. A single 
genus confined to the Old World and Australia, and forming a perfectly isolated 
group I 'araniis Merrem 

In the mandible, Meckel's cartilage is not overroofed by the spleuial 
bone. The dentary is not produced far posteriorly on the external side. 
The surangular bone is distinct. The symphysis mandible is not 
closely fitted, but is more or less free. 

The genus Varanus includes, according to Boulenger, 28 species. 
None of these are of small size, and some of them reach a length of 
6 feet. 

HELODERMATOIDEA. 

Helodtrmatoidea Gill, Smithsonian Report fur 1885, 188G, p. 800.

and i)alatines widely separated; infraorbital fossa bounded by the 
pterygoid, palatine, transverse bone, and maxillary. Head with bony 
tubercles. Eyelids well developed. Limbs well developed; chivicle

Several descriptions of the skull and parts of the skeleton of Helo- 
derma have been i)ublished, but all of them are seriously defective in 
not taking into account certain of the characters which are essential to 
a true understanding of the taxonomic position of the genus. For the 
following description I have before me two skeletons of the //. suspec- 
trum belonging to the U. S. National Museum.

terior border abruptly emarginate to receive an anterior process of the 
vomers. The latter are very elongate, in contact for the anterior two- 
thirds of their length, but widely divaricating posteriorly ; thin inferior 
surface convex in transverse sections; narial fossa? very large, the ante- 
rior extremity much narrowed. Palatine bones wider than long, the 
vomerine and palatine limbs subequal; palatine foramen very small, 
longitudinal; pterygoid narrowed anterior to basipterygoid processes, 
the anterior portion expanding gradually from behind; no pterygoid 
teeth; ectopterygoid ilat; nasals narrow, encroached on each side 
of the middle by the elongate nostrils and with very slight contact 
with the prefrontals; frontals distinct from each other, wide; inferior 
plates oblique, in contact below, thus inclosing the olfactory lobes; 
parietal undivided, expanded laterally and without pineal foramen; 
supraoccipital scarcely in contact with parietal, which overhangs it; 
parietoquadrate arch very distinct, wide, its distal portion in front 
consisting of the large paroccipital; exoccipitals suturally distinct from 
both supra- ana basi-occipital; facial ])lateof maxillary a ery large; pre- 
frontals elongate, extending over the orbit to meet the postfrontals ; 
lachrymal small, scarcely touching prefrontal, bounding the large lach- 
rymal foramen anteriorly and in contact with jugal. The latter is an L- 
shaped bone, the subvertical limb reaching thei)ostfrontal; postfrontal 
rather large, irregularly subtriangular; no postorhital ; supratemporal a 
vertically triangular rudiment at the anterior base of the paroccipital; 
quadrate with one, an extero posterior, conch; presphenoid cartilagi- 
nous; sphenoid and basioccipital distinct, not expanded laterally, the 
lateral descending tuberosities of the latter well defined; a large con- 
dylar foramen divided by an internal partition ; occipital condyle dis- 
tinctly tripartite; the pterygoid originates opposite the basipterygoids 
and touches both the petrosal and parietal, the latter sending down a 
slight lateral ridge. The subforami'nal portion of the petrosal is not 
as long as the supraforaminal part and has a mere trace of a groove 
on its external side. 

In the mandibile the groove of Meckel's cartilage is open throughout. 
The coronoid bone is extended in both directions on the inner side 
and anteriorly only on the external side. The dentary is short, not 
extending behind the anterior suture of the coronoid; spleuial rather 
elevated, extending anterior to splenial foramen ; surangular and artic- 
ular distinct; angle narrowed, directed gently inward. 

The hyoid apparatus is simple. No second ceratobrauchials ; the first 
simple osseous. Ceratohyal much curved, returning posteriorly on 
itself anteriorly to meet the extremity of the rather short hypohyal. 
Basihyal not wide. 

There are only two ossified intercentra of the cervical vertebr*, and 
there are no hypapophyses. Atlas and two cervicals only without ribs. 
No zygosphene; prezygaspophysial surface simple. The two sacral 
centra and diapophyses are not coossified. Caudal centra not seg-

mented, fiiruishecl with short diapophyses, (chevron bones, aud neural 
spiues to near the end of the series; the last-named standing at the 
posterior border of the neural arch. Chevrons attached at posterior 
eud of centrum, completely developed. Xeural spines of cervical ver- 
tebrjB moderate; those of lumbar region low. 

Suprascapula short, wide; scapula short without proscapula; cora- 
coid without eniargiuation; epicoracoid large. Sternum with a small 
anterior foiitanelle and a posterior emargination and an unossifled line 
connecting the two; a groove diverges from the fontanelle on each side 
parallel to the coracoid border. Four sternal ribs on each side and no 
xiphoid rod. All the ribs with short, cartilaginous, free htemapophyses. 

Ilium slender, without amjulus crista'; acetabulum not emargiuate. 
Pubis subtransverse; pectineal process small, external. Ischium rather 
wide, tubev an angle oidy. 

The teeth have been frecpiently described, owing to their seeming 
adaptation to act as venom conduits to the wound they can inflict. 
They are pleurddont and attached by a very obliqiie base rather than 
by the side. The crown is conic and compressed acutely at the tip. 
The anterior face is marked by a deep groove which runs external to 
the nnddle line. It is formed by the rolling inward of the external 
layer of the crown over the anterior face of the tooth, at the base, the 
roll being less and less distinct upward. 

The mesenteries of Heloderma are characteristic. There is a single 
hepatoventral, and the gastrohepatic has the usual position. The right 
hepatic goes to the right side of the stomach, becoming a right gastro- 
hepatic, and does not extend to the dorsal peritoneum, a character in 
which it is unique in the Sauria. Posterior to the middle of the liver 
they unite on the middle line as in the Teiida'. The lungs are attached 
to the adjacent i)arts of the gastric peritoneum bj^ separate sheets, the 
right and left gastropulmonary. Besides these there is a strong sheet 
on each side extending from the suix'rior side of the liver near the 
border to the body wall, forming the right and left hepatolateral. The 
right hepatolateral does not extend along the right border of the liver 
beyond thecephalad half. The right gastrohepatic extends along the 
elongate right process of the liver to the genital fold of the peritoneum, 
aud the apex of the liver sends a recurrent sheet backward, which 
forms with the former a funnel-shaped passage. This recurrent sheet 
might be regarded as a caudad he})atolateral. Dr. Shufeldt states' 
that Heloderma possesses the free ventral i)eritoneum found in Varanus; 
but this is not the case, as this structure is the usual one. 

The peritoneum forms a transverse fold at the posterior part of the 
corpora adiposa, supporting the urinary bladder, and forming the 
cystic mesentery. It is but loosely attached to the corpora adiposa, 
which do not project freely from the body wall, and hence have no 
special peritoneal pouch. They are elongate and coarsely subdivided.

476 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

The two aorta roots extend considerably anterior to tbe heart before 
turning posteriorly ; the right root receives near its origin the common 
carotid, which soon thereafter divides into the right and left carotid. 
The right and left bronchi are distinct, but not elongate. The lungs 
are of subequal length; they are filled with coarse cells for about two- 
thirds their length. 

The liver extends cephalad to the heart by its left lobe, the right 
falling a little short. The entire organ is large and elongate, the right 
lobe extending considerably beyond the left, but not terminating in a 
narrow strip, as in many Pachyglossa. The gall-bladder looks down- 
ward through a round foramen of the liver, between its two distal 
lobes, which are joined candad to it. The alimentary canal includes an 
elongate stomach, followed by a rather elongate small intestine, which 
passes gradually into a moderately large rectum. The muscular walls 
of the stomach are not thick. The kidneys are rather wide, and about 
two-thirds of their length is within the pelvic cavity, the remaining 
third projecting anteriorly to it. 

The hemipenis is undivided. Opposite to the sulcus spermaticus is 
a welt, which is smooth ; between it and the sulcus are coarse plicate 
transverse folds, which extend to the apex of the organ. 

There are two species of this genus, which differ as follows: 

Pterygo- palatine teeth present ; tail equal or longer than body ; head and neck about 
half body; fore limbs to orbit; predominating color, black H. liorridnm. 

No pterygo-palatine teeth ; tail two-thirds body ; bead and neck one-third body ; fore 
limb to orbit ; predominating color, yellow H. suspectum. 

The Heloderma horridum Wiegmann has been brought from western 
Mexico, from Presidio on the north to as far south as the Isthmus of 
Tehuantepec. It has not been brought from eastern Mexico, so far as 
I am aware. The H. suspectum Cope is restricted to southern Arizona 
and New Mexico, so that a wide interval intervenes between the ranges 
of the two species.

width of the brown rings, wliich are almost separated into two by an 
imperfect bar beneath and a series of four round spots on each side 
above, colored like the interspaces and involving four to six tubercles. 
One of these rings above the shoulders crosses the forearm. Another 
passes above the arms and across the middle of the thigh. The rest of 
the legs, with the entire head and throat, are black, except at the top 
of head behind the eyes, which is yellow. The tail, including the tip, 
shows four black rings and three yellow ones. 

This regular arrangement of pattern on the body is appreciable only 
in the young. With increasing age the rings become broken up, and 
the pattern becomes an irregular, coarse reticulation of blackish, 
embracing the yellow tubercles, one or more looking like differently 
colored beads. The yellow predominates in some S])ecimeus, the black 
in others. The head is always black, with its yellow parietal patch. 
• Form clumsy and very heavy; head much broader than the neck, 
much depressed and flat above, the sides vertical and approaching each 
other anteriorly at an acute angle, but the muzzle broad and rounded. 

The animal is covered everywhere except below with large tubercles, 
about the size of grains of No. 6 shot, each with a bony nucleus. 
These are subhemispherical, but generally somewhat calyptrate, exhib- 
iting a blunted apex which is directed a little backward. Most of these 
exhibit a series of circular ridges and furrows parallel with the base of 
the tubercle. These vary in number, never extend to the apex of the 
tubercle, and are generally confined to the base. 

These tubercles are arranged in regular series, which run obliquely 
backward from a shallow furrow along the back (irom behind the shoul- 
ders to the tail) to the sides. They are, however, set in a frame of 
much smaller tubercular scales, generally in single series, sometimes 
more crowded. This framework constitutes a quite regularly hexag- 
onal tessellation, with the rounded large tubercle set in the middle of 
each piece. Besides the obliquely longitudinal arrangement of the 
large tubercles, they may be traced in a more transverse one of fifteen 
or sixteen on each side. 

On the belly and beneath the tail the tubercles change to quadrate 
and nearly square tessellated ])lates, close together and without inter- 
vening smaller ones. These also exhibit a tendency to arrangement in 
reference to a median line. They are placed in transverse series, corre- 
sponding in number Avith tliose of the sides and back, the change from 
one to the other not being very strongly marked. There are about 
twenty-five across the belly, and about sixty series from the end of the 
throat to the groin, with five or six more in the pubic region, where the 
plates are more irregular, the anal slit bordered by two median ones 
larger than the rest. The tail shows about fifty-five whorls of tuber- 
cles and plates corres))onding with those on the body. It is very thick 
and blunt, subtetrahedral, and widening a little from the base to the 
middle. 



CKOCOUILIANS, LIZARDS, AND KNAKES. 479 

The legs are covered with tubercles much as on the back, but smaller, 
and iu places more depressed, especially on the under surface of the 
hind leg and the upper of the forearm. They are still smaller and 
more distant on the posteiior face of the liumerus. 

The tubercles on the top of the head are larger than those on the 
back, and compacted, without the intervening small ones, giving some- 
what of a hexagonal shape. Tliey become larger to the tip of snout 
and are quite similar on the cheeks. The nostrils are terminal, lateral, 
large, and semicircular, the chord vertical and anterior, formed by 
two nearly square plates, one above the other. The rostral is about 
half as high as long, nearly (juadrangular or depressed pentagonal. 
On each side of it is one labial of equal height, succeeded by twelve 
others, the first four or five of which have a second series above them. 
The mental plate is as wide as the rostral. There are about twelve 
labials on each side of this. There are four median i)airs of large sub- 
quadrate plates behind the mental, and four or five smaller, more hex- 
agonal series between these and the labial. The rest of the under 
surface of the head is covered with regular elongated ovoidal tubercles, 
half as large as those on the back, but without intervening smaller 
ones. 

The ears are vertical or a little oblique, quite large, though not very 
conspicuous. The eyes are small, the eyelids short, very thick, and 
covered with tubercles, one series above and two below. Although 
the entire head is covered with tubercles, there may be traced a series 
of about six behind and below the eye, with a continuation of four 
more quadrate ones to the nostril. 

The legs are short and stout, the hinder scarcely, if any, longer than 
the anterior. The feet are all five-toed, with conspicuous claws. The 
fore feet are decidedly larger and broader, with consideiably longer 
claws than the hinder ones. All the digits exhibit inferiorly a series 
of transverse, imbricated, coarse lamelhc. The fingers are nearly of 
equal length, the claws of first and fifth reaching as far as bases of 
those of second, third, and fourth. The toes are more unecpial; the 
third and fourth about equal, the second claw reaching the base of the 
third, tlie fifth that of second, the first that of fifth. 

The teeth of Ilcloderina are acrodont, or on the summit of elevations 
of the bones bearing them. They are long, conical, acute, slightly 
recurved, and all have a conspicuous furrow on the anterior face from 
the base to tip, apparently formed by the folding together of a triangular 
plate. I can detect no evidence of any poison glands. The teeth are 
few iu number, distant, eight or ten on each side of each jaw, and 
though long are so much embedded in the fleshy gums as to exhibit 
only the points. They are confined to the anteiior part of the jaws, and 
do not come as far back as the jwsterior nares. The palate is deeply 
but broadly excavated, the pterygoid bones are prominent, and in one 
specimen bear a single conical tooth. 



480 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, ^98. 

The tongue is thick and fleshy; arrow-shaped or oblong cordate; the 
base deeply emarginate with rounded lobes, the tip thin, flattened, and 
bifid for about one-fifth the whole length. Posteriorly it is covered by 
coarse papillie or short filaments; on the terminal half these are much 
shorter, lower, and more compact, while the ends of the bifid tip are 
smooth. The tongue is attached firmly along its middle (though per- 
haps narrowly) for the basal two-thirds, the terminal portion being 
free, smooth beneath, and divided by a median furrow, the portion 
covering the bifid tip rather distinct and ovate. 

The skin of the tail is very rough and continuous, so that it holds 
together the vertebrae very firmly and does not allow the tail to break. 
A specimen has the tail partly decomposed, and } et the tough skin 
keeps all the vertebras together. 

The description of Meloderma suspeetum, as given above, differs in 
some important points from that of Wiegmann's of the H. horriduni, 
A conspicuous difference of the external features is seen in the small 
tubercles encircling the large ones, said by Wiegmaun to be wanting 
and forming the basis of subfamily distinction from the Varanidte. 
These tubercles, though small and containing no bony center like the 
large ones, are yet very appteciable. The large tubercles are more 
widely separated in his figure than in nature, owing, doubtless, to the 
skin being stretched, which would at the same time eradicate the small 
basal intermediate tubercles. The tail is given as equal to the body 
instead of half the head and body, and is also more attenuated. It is 
said to have five yellow rings instead of four. The head is entirely 
black. These characters are confirmed by three si)ecimens sent by 
Mr. F. Sumichrast from Tehuantepec, Mexico, all stuffed skins, and 
which served as the basis of comparison when I distinguished this 
species from the H. horrid urn. 

I find the following characters to be constant: When specimens of 
the two species with identical body length are compared the tail of the 
H. suspeetum is seen to be about two-thirds the length of that of the 
H. Jiorridum, and the muzzle of the H. suspeetum reaches only to the front 
of the orbit of the H. hor-riduni. The forefoot reaches to the nostril in 
the H. suspeetum and to the orbit in the H. horridum. The scales on 
the head of the H. horridum are larger than those on the H. suspeetum, 
especially posterior to the orbit; but, as the head is longer in the former, 
the number counted between the orbit and the ear is equal in the two 
species. In counting across the head from one angle of the mouth to 
the other I find 21 scales in the H. suspeetum and 17 in the H. horriduni. 
In the latter I count 44 crossrows of abdominal scales; in the former 
52. The ground color in the H. horridum is black, and yellow marks 
are sparse. In the JI. suspeetum the yellow is more conspicuous than 
the black on the head and on the belly, and is equally so on the upper 
surfaces of the body and tail. The dimensions of the two species are 
about the same. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARD8, AND SNAKES. 481 

Uoulenjier ' further adds the iollowing differences between the two: 

lu the //. sitspectiim tlie oral i)ortion of the preniaxillarj is narrower, and its 
asceudiiig iuteriiarial bar wider tlian in ihe If. liorridiwi. Eight or nine x)remaxil- 
lary teeth are present in H. horridiim and only six in H. suspecttim. Dr. Shufeldt, 
liowev(!r, represents eight teeth in the latter species, but his figure showing all the 
teeth as of the same si/.e looks very diagrammatic. The postorbital arch is more 
slender in U. suspecium. Palatine and pterygoid teeth appear to be constantly 
absent in H. suspectum, whereas they are present in both slvulls of H. horridnm 
examined by me, as well as in those described by Trosehel and by Kaup 

1 remark on these statements, that in two crania of //. .sunpeetum 
before me there are no pterygoid or palatine teeth, except that in one 
there are two rudiments on the palatine of one side and one rudiment on 
the other. In both there are alveoli for eight premaxillary teeth, and 
in both only one of these is unoccupied by a tooth. In both the pre- 
maxillary spine is wide at the base, as described by Boulenger for 
the H. suspectum, but in both it is long, as described by him for the 
H. horridum. 

Ilahifs. — It has been shown that the bite of the Helodcrma suspecium 
is, under favorable circumstances, poisonous. P^xperiments tried at or 
near Tucson, Arizona, by Dr. Irwin, United States Army, in 1862-G3, 
did not demonstrate this fact, as fowls bitten by the Heloilerma did not 
die. Dr. K. W. Shufeldt was bitten by a specimen at the Smithsonian 
Institution, Washington, and he describes his symptoms in a paper 
published in the American Naturalist. 

The results were not serious nor diflerent from such as result from 
any lacerated wound. Experiments made by Drs. S. Weir Mitchell and 
Edward F. Eeichert, of the University of Pennsylvania, showed that 
the saliva injected into the body is speedily fatal to pigeons and fowls. 

The history of observations as to the venomous characteristics of 
this species is thus given by Dr. II. W. Shufeldt:- 

At the present writing the wide variance of opinion in these premises is truly 
remarkable, for some of our most distinguished investigators still disagree in the 
matter, and those, too, who have made the most exhaustive examinations of the 
saliva of this reptile. 

As long ago as 1857, .John Edward Gray, of the British Museum, in referring to 
Necturus, said, "I know of no other instance of a batrachiau having this structure 
of its teeth, nor do I know of any instance, except in the Mexican li/ard called 
Hcloderina horridum, in which all the teeth are uniformly furnished with a basal 
cavity and foramen, and this lizard is said to be noxious; but tlie fact has not been 
distinctly proved." 

Prof. E. I). Cope, who first clearly characterized this reptile ami gave it its pres- 
ent name of Ilelodenna suspectum, has stated that "though the lizards of this genus 
could not be ])roved to indict a poisonous bite, yet the salivary glaiuls of the lower 
jaw were emptied by an etfereut duct which issued at the base of each tooth, and in 
such a way tliat the saliva would bo couveyed into the wound by the deep groove 
of the crown." 

Then several j'ears passed before much else was published upon this special topic

482 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

of the life liistory of the Helodcrma, when Suuiichrast, a well-known naturalist 
resident in Mexico, stated it as his opinion that it was the exception that small 
mammals died from the hite of this saurian. 

Soon after there appeared an editorial in the American Naturalist (1882, ji. 842) 
referring to the experiments of Ur. Irwin, of the Army, which went to prove that 
the bite of the Heloderm was comparatively harndess; but it added, further, that a 
specimen in the Zoological Garden of London had bitten a frog and a guinea pig, 
both of which had died in a few moments. Still, the editor of the Naturalist Avas of 
the opinion that "this might happen if this large lizard was not poisonous, and 
there is room for more careful experiments as to its venomous qualities." 

In the same year no less distinguished an authority than Dr. Giinther, of the 
British Museum, comes forward and states that there can be no doubt as to the poi- 
sonous nature of the bite of II clod erm a horridiim, and cites numerous cases to supi)ort 
his views; and Dr. Sclater, the secretary of the Zoological Society of London, 
apparently entertained a similar opinion, as did also the eudnent herpetologist, Mr. 
Boulenger, of the British Museum. 

During the same year the present writer, who was at that time connected with the 
department of reptiles at the U. S. National Museum, was severely bitten by an 
infuriated adult specimen of Heloderma suspectum, and although much pain and grave 
symptoms at once supervened, the results passed entirely away in a few days with 
barely any treatment. I published a short account of it at the time. Again, before 
the year closed. Sir Josejih Fayrer brought forth some evidence, deduced from 
experiments, that went to show the poisonous nature of the bite of a Heloderm. 

Early in 1883, however, the matter seemed to be definitely settled for good and 
all, through the results obtained by the very celebrated experiments of those two 
distinguished physicians of Philadelphia, Dr. S. Weir Mitchell and Dr. Edward T. 
Keichert. After a most carefully conducted series of experiments with the saliva 
taken from living Ilelodcrms, these authorities were prepared to say that it possessed 
properties of an extremely venomous nature, killing pigeons and small mammnls a 
few moments after they had received an injection of it hypodermically. 

Five years now elapsed with hardly a printed word appearing anywhere upon the 
question of the poisonous or nonpoisonous qualities of the saliva of one of these 
suspected reptiles. Then there appeared an account of the somewhat remarkable 
series of experiments made with the saliva of living Heloderms by Dr. H. C. Yarrow 
at the U. S. National Museum, Dr. Yarrow at the time being honorary curator of the 
department of reptiles in that institution. This investigator's methods of procedure 
were rather different from those adopted by Mitchell and Reichert, but apparently 
they were conducted with equal care, and, strange to say, led to an entirely differ- 
ent result. Some eight or nine exjieriments upon chickens and rabbits went to 
prove that hypodermic injections of the saliva and bites of angry Heloderms were 
by no means fatal to those animals, and practically they always recovered from the 
effects of the same. After presenting the steps of his linal trial, this author con- 
cludes his account with the following remarks: "This experiment would seem to 
show that a large amount of the Heloderm saliva can be inserted into the tissues 
without producing any harm, and it is still a mystery to the writer how Dr. Mitchell 
and Dr. Reichert obtained entirely different results. Were it not for the well-known 
accuracy and carefulness of Dr. Mitchell, it might be supposed jiossibly that the 
hypodermic syringe used in his experiments contained a certain amount of Croialua 
or cobra venom, but under the circumstances such a hypothesis is entirely untena- 
ble." The following year Dr. Mitchell still adhered to his original opinion, aad 
undoubtedly does at the present time. 

Mr. Samuel Garman, of the Museum of Comparative Zoology of Harvard Univer- 
sity, next made some very interesting experiments by allowing large and vigorous 
Heloderms to bite the shaved legs of kittens, and here again these feline victims 
refused to succumb to the effects of the wounds. , 



CROCODILIAN^, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES.

Very evidently the last word upon this subject has not yet been said, and opinions 
are very much divided, a host of supporters appearing upon either side. 

In confinement, as in nature, the Heloderma suspectum is sluggish in 
its movements. It is not especially timid, and opens its mouth and 
ejects air in bursts from its lungs at the intruder. Some individuals 
will seize a stick presented to them and hold on tenaciously. Its breath 
is fetid, which adds to the forbidding character of the animal. A 
specimen sent me by Dr. J. G. Gibson from St. Thomas, Arizona, became 
rather tame, and showed a liking for having the top of its head 
scratched with a stick. It showed more than* usual interest in passing 
events, raising itself on its fore feet and elevating its head as though 
listening. Like most of the individuals kept in confinement it ate 
readily of raw eggs, lapping them up with the protrusile smooth extrem- 
ity of the tongue. They also drink water by inserting the nose into 
the lluid. In climbing up steep places it utilizes its robust tail as a 
support, and a very slight hold with the powerful claws of the fore feet 
is sufficient to enable it to raise itself. 

It is not uncommon in the dry and desert regions of southern Ari- 
zona. I have heard of its occurrence in the adjacent regions of New 
Mexico, but did not meet with it myself on any of several visits I paid 
to that country. Dr. Stejneger reports that the Death Valley explor- 
ing expedition obtained a specimen from the Virgin Kiver in southern 
Nevada. Dr. Merriam was told by the Mormons that the species occurs 
in the Lower Santa Clara Valley in southwestern Utah, but it is rare.

484 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

DIPLOGLOSSA. 

Diploglossa COPK, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phihi., 1864, p. 227; Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 
No. 32, 1887, p. 25. 

Petrous bone produced anterior to anterior semicircular canal. Clav- 
icle simple proximally. Interclavicle cruciform (with exceptions in 
degenerate forms). Premaxillary undivided. Mandibular elements 
distinct; dentary not produced far posteriorly. Tongue papillose, the 
apex smooth and generally retractile into papillose portion. 

This superfamily occupies a position between tlie Pachyglossa and 
Leptoglossa, having tbe tongue and clavicle of the former, and the 
interclavicle and petrous bone of the latter. Its composition is some- 
what heterogeneous, since the Zonurid;c differ in some respects from 
the other families. 

The following' characters of the visceral anatomy are common to all 
the families except the Zonuridie: 

Alimentary canal with a stomach and elongate rectum only differen- 
tiated. Liver very elongate, usually two lobed posteriorly, the right 
lobe a little longer. Gall-bladder located at the apex of the fissure 
separating the lobes or proximad to it, exposed ififeriorly, or only covered 
by thin tissue. Corpus adiposum not projecting freely into the body- 
cavity (except Zonuridai). 

Peculiar modifications are exhibited by the snake-like genera, which 
do not, however, invalidate the preceding definitions. In Pseudopns, 
Ophisaurus, JJopasia, and Anguis, together with Celestus and Diplo- 
glossHs [monotropis) which are not snake-like, the left lung is shorter 
than the right. The liver is greatly elongated in the four genera first 
named above, and in Ophisaurus {ventralis) the left lobe is absent. In 
the other snake like genera it is present, but shorter than the right. 
In Pseudopus, OpMsaurus, and Anguis the ventral mesentery extends 
to the rectum. It has a similar extent in Dopasia, but seems to be 
interrupted. In lacertiform Diploglossa the ventral mesentery is sim- 
ple and terminates at the liver or a little beyond it. 

Zonurus differs in several respects from other Diploglossa. The liver 
is trilobate posteriorly, but the gall-bladder has the inferior exposure 
normal to the superfamily. The corpora adiposa project freely into the 
body-cavity, which is not the case in other Diploglossa. 

In Xenosaurus grandis and Celestus stenurus the kidneys are larger 
than in species of other genera examined. 

As already remarked, the hemipenis in this suiierfamily is trans- 
versely laminate or flounced, and is never calyculate. The structures 
differ much in detail. Thus in some of the Anguida? the organ 
possesses osseous spines, which is unusual in Sauria, although general 
in Ophidia. In the Xenosauridas it is remarkably papillose. In none 
of the genera are the laminae delicate and thin as in the Teiidse, but 
they are thick and frequently wrinkled or pocketed. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 485 

Four families are referable to tlie Dlploglossa, which are defined as 
follows. The position of the Pygopodidte is somewhat uncertain : 

I. Apex of tongue not retractile. 

Cranial arches present; interclavicle cruciform; orbit bounded by frontal bone; 
corpus adiijosum projecting freely into body-cavity Zonukid.e 

Cranial arches absent; interclavicle rudimental are wanting; iirefrontal and 
postfrontal united above orbit; articular, angular, and surangular bones not 
distinct Pygopodid.k 

II. Apex of tongue retractile. Corpus adiposum entirely adherent. 

Cranial arches present; no inferior frontal arch; interclat^icle cruciform; teeth 
nleiirodont; osteodermal plates AxGUiD.K 

Cranial arches present; no inferior frontal arch ; interclavicle cruciform ; teeth 
pleurodont ; no osteodernial plates Xenosaurid.e 

The families of Section I are Old World, the Zonuridae belonging to 
the Ethiopian zoological realm, and the Pygopodidic to the Australian. 
The remaining families are Xew World, except that among Auguidie 
three genera belong to the palaearctic realm.

Tongue short, villose, scarcely protractile, entire or very feebly nicked at the end. 
Dentition pleurodont; teeth numerous, small, with long cylindrical shafts, hollowed 
out at the base. Palate toothless. Postorbital and frontosquamosal arches bony; 
snpratemporal fossa loofed over by dermo-osslfication ; pr;pmaxillary, frontal, and 
parietal single; nasals distinct; iialatinesand pterygoids widely separated mediallj-, 
both bordering the infraorbital fossa; head with dermal bony shields. Clavicle 
slender, not dilated proximally; interclavicle cruciform; sternum without fonta- 
nelle. No abdominal ribs. Head symmetrically shielded. Eyelids well developed. 
Scales on the body, if not granular, arranged in transverse series. Osteodermal 
plates present in one genus, but devoid of distinct tubules. 

Like the preceding, this family has ])oint8 of resemblance with the Iguanida' and 
with the Anguidie. From the former it is distinguished bj^ the cranial dermal ossi- 
fications and the cruciform interclavicle," from the latter by the tongue, which, like 
that of the Iguanida', is not divisible into an anterior and a posterior part, the 
Cttdodont dentition, and the structure of the bony plates of the body when present. 
(Boulenger.) 

Six genera are known, inhabiting South and tropical Africa and 
Madagascar.

SYNOPSIS OF THE GENERA. 

I. Limbs well developed. 

A. Back with osteodermal plates. 

Dorsal scales large Zoniirns Merrem. 

AA. Back without osteodermal plates. 

Dorsal lepidosis heterogeneous Psetidoeordylus Smith. 

Dorsal lepidosis uniformly granular Platysaurus Smith. 

II. Limbs rudimentary, body serpentiform ; scales lanceolate, keeled. 

Limbs present; digits 5-5 Cricochalcis Wiegmann. 

Limbs present, undivided Chamasanra Schneider. 

No fore limbs ; hind limbs undivided Mancus Cope. 

The mesenteries in the geuus Zonurus are of the usual type. There 
are one hepatoventral, a gastrohepatic, a left gastropulmonary, and a 
right hepatic, which incloses the right lung. 

The hemipeuis I have only seen in the Zonurus cordylus. It is short 
and swollen so that the spiral structure is accentuated. There is a rigid 
welt opposite the sulcus, which leaves a triangular space at one side 
proximad which is finely calyculate. On the opposite side of the welt 
distad is a wide space with radiating lamina; from a smooth center. 
The presence of calyculi noted is exceptional in the Diploglossa, and 
Indicates approximation to the Pachyglossa as far as it goes. 

The arches and limbs of the degenerate species Mancus maerolepiSy 
from Katal, have the following characters: Scapular and pelvic arches 
both present. Anterior limbs, none; posterior limb, an externally 
undivided rudiment. 

ScajJidar arch. — All the elements present. Sternum supporting three 
haemal ribs on each side, deeply emarginate so as to be horseshoe- 
shaped, with a short posterior prolongation; each branch cartilaginous 
anteriorly. Suprascapula cartilaginous. Scapula and coracoid con- 
fluent, osseous; procoracoid cartilage. Interclavicle cruciform, with 
long posterior axis. 

Pelvic arch. — All the elements present, but small and slender. Ilium 
attached to the distally confluent diapophyses of two vertebnie. Pubes 
slender, in contact anteriorly. Ischia directed anteriorly, not forming 
a symphysis, but separated by a median osseous element, which, fol- 
lowing Baur, I call the hypogastroid bone. This is produced anteriorly 
as a cartilage, which joins the pubes, and posteriorly as a median simple 
cartilaginous rod. 

Posterior limb. — This is about as long as the pubis and half the ilium. 
It consists of a femur, distinct but closely apposed tibia and fibula, 
about three-fifths the lengtli of the femur, and a simple conical tarsal.

According to Bouleuger — 

Tlie promaxillary is single, narrowed, and much produced posteriorly between tlie 
nasals, in the long-suoiiled lAalls (juite as much as in the Varan idte ; the nasals are 
distinct; the frontal is single; the pr;c- and postfrontals ai'e in contact, separating 
the frontal from the orbit; the parietals remain distinct, except in LiaUs; the jugal 
is rudimentary, tliere being no postorbital arch; a postfrontosquamosal arch is also 
absent; the pterygoids are widely separated and toothless. The mandible contains 
only four bones, the angular, supra-angular, and articular having coalesced. The 
dentition is pleurodont. The teeth are small, numerous, and closely set; in Lialis 
they are recurved posteriorly, very acute, and swollen at the base, thus resembling 
those of the Varanidic, whilst in the other genera they do not diverge from the 
normal pleurodont type, being obtusely pointed and with long cylindrical shafts. 
The skin of the head is quite free from the cranial ossification and there are no supra- 
orbital bones. The serpentiform body is destitute of functional limbs ; the fore limb 
is entirely absent, while the hind pair is visible externally as a scaly flap, most 
developed in Py(jopus, in which the bones of the limb may be felt more or less dis- 
tinctly ; when the skin is removed in Fygopus the foot with five ossified toes is seen 
most plainly, especially in the males; the ischium appears externally us a small spur 
on each side behind the anal cleft. The sternal apparatus exists in a rudimentary 
state. The tail is long and fragile. The eyes are rather small, with elliptico- 
vertical or subelliptical pupil, and not protected by movable lids. The ear is either 
exposed or concealed under the scales. The tongue is fleshy, papillose, elongate, 
more or less fully incised anteriorly, and extensible. The body is covered with 
roundish imbricate scales and the head is more or less regularly plated. Pr:eanal 
pores are frequently present.

only; supporting two lucmal ribs at its i)osterior extremity. Clavicles 
long, slender, extended well anteriorly, simple and in contact distally. 
Coracoid, precoracoid, and scapula, osseous, confluent. Goracoid carti- 
lage not reaching precoracoid. 

Pelvic arch. — Ilium elongate, proximal half horizontal, parallel with 
three vertebra:^; distal i)ortion decurved and confluent with pubis and 
ischium. Latter elements both rudimental, widely separated on the 
median line. Hypogastroid cartilage represented by a slender rod 
extending posteriorly on each side from the position of the acetabulum. 
Perhaps these cartilages represent the ischia, but they are possibly 
present with ischia in Oplieocles. 

Posterior limb. — This consists of femur, tibia, and fibula, and four 
metatarsals, all inclosed in a common integument. It is about as long 
as the ilium. 

My observations on this genus agree with those of Fiirbringer

Boulenger's description is as follows: 

The tongue is comjjosed of two distinct portions — a principal posterior, thick, 
covered with villiform papillae; and a small anterior, thin, emarginate, covered with 
lepidoid imbricate papilla", extensible and more or less retractile into a sheath 
formed by a transverse fold at the anterior extremity of the villose portion. This 
retractility of the distal part of the tongue appears to be constant, though more 
accentuated in some species than in others; but it should be borne in mind that 
when the tongue is fully extended, every trace of the transverse fold or sheath dis- 
appears, which accounts for the seeming exceptions presented by spirit specimens 
in that condition. 

The dentition varies from the strictly pleurodont tubercular teeth of I'seudopus 
apns and some THpIoglossi, through the conical teeth of the majority of species, to 
the curved fangs of Angnis. The dentition of the latter has no other equivalent but 
that of Uelodcrma, to which it bears considerable resemblance; and Leydig has even 
discovered the presence of a slight groove along the anterior surface of the teeth 
which appears to be homologous -with the anterior groove of the poisonous lizard's 
fangs; the teeth of Anguis are likewise remarkable for the comparatively feeble 
attachment to the jaws, as in Reloderma and the snakes. The new teeth do not hol- 
low out the base of the old ones, but originate between them. The palate is either 
toothless, or teeth may be developed on the pterygoids or even on the palatines and 
vomers (Ojyhisaurns). 

The skull belongs to the normal Saurian type. The premaxillary is single; 
nasals distinct; frontal single in Ge/T/iono/«s, double in the other genera; parietal 
single; palatines and pterygoids well separated along the medial line; infraorbital 
fossa bounded by the palatine, pterygoid, transverse bone, and maxillary. Dermal 
cranial ossifications are present, which roof over the supratemporal fossa. The limbs

may be more or less doveloped, or eutirely absent externally, in which case, how- 
ever, the rndiinents of the pectoral and pelvic arches are always present. The 
clavicle is slender, and the iuterclaviclc, in the species with well-developed limbs, 
crnciforni. Abdominal ribs are absent. 

The body is protected by b:)ny plates nnderlying the scales, which are imbricate 
and snbequal. Those ])lates are provided with a system of fine tubules, as in the 
Scincida;, which differ from those of the latter family in bein^f arranged irregularly 
or forming radiating or arl)orcsccnt figures. The licad shields present this jiecul- 
iarity, that an occipital or azygous posterior shield is constantly present, a character 
which ditferentiates the Angnida; from most of the Scincida-. 

These lizards are terrestrial. Jw^Hisisovoviviparous. They are most almndantly 
represented in Central America (Gcrrhonotus) and the West Indies (Celestas); a 
few species occur in North and South America; two in Europe and the borders of 
the Mediterranean, and one in the Himalayas and Burma. 

This family I constructed from fragments of the old Zonurid* aud 
Scincidii?, agreeing with Peters in referring the Old World representa- 
tives of the former to the Lacertidse and tliose of the New to the neigh- 
borhood of Heloderma. From the Scincid.ie I have taken the New 
World Diploglossina?, finding them possessed of the same i)eculiar char- 
acters which associate Pscudopus with Gerrhonotus and Heloderma. 
The families represented by these types do not possess the dilated 
maxillary laminti^ of the Scincida'. 

There are four subgroups among the genera of Anguidie, namely: 
Ophisaurin.'e, with the anterior limb of the mesosternum very short or 
wanting, the dorsal s<;alesin crossrows and a lateral fold; genera Dopa- 
sia, Pseudojms, OphisauruSj and Opheodes. Anguiniie, with shortened 
mesosternum and no lateral fold ; Opheodes and Angnis. Diploglossin;ie, 
without lateral fold, with elongate anterior limb of mesosternum and 
quincuneial scales, containing Onida,Panolopus, Sauresia, DipJof/lossus, 
MicroJepis, and Celestus. (In I), monoiropis Peters I have observed an 
apparent exception to the rule of the retractility of the end of the 
tongue in this tribe.) Finally, in the preceding groups there is a large 
foramen which connects the nasal meatus with the anterior part of the 
pfilate on each side in the premaxillary bone, which is wanting in the 
Gerrhonotina', and there are dermal shields on the parietal and occip- 
ital regions, which are represented by scales in the Oerrhonotina'. 

The hemipenis presents well-marked characters, which distinguish 
the genera and perhaps the subfamilies. In Celestus the extremity car- 
ries an osseous spicule of relatively large size. Distad of the flounces 
are inore ((!. stenitrus) or less {C. hadius) numerous longitudinal series 
of recurved osseous spines, which are longer near the sulcus spermati- 
cus. In C. sfenxrus the flounces are apiculate at regular intervals. 
Organ undivided. In the (lerrhonotina' the flounces are cupped and 
continue to the apex without spines; in Barissia and Gerrhonotus the 
organ is bifurcate; in Elgaria simple. In .Ajjflr?^?.? a welt on each side 
of the sulcus has tubercular cross ridges, and the remainder of the sur- 
face is marked with oblique folds with tubercular margins, tbrming a 
chevron which is directed distad. In Pseiidopus opus the organ is not 
symmetrical. Opposite the sulcus is a low, broad, smooth welt, and on 



490 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

each side the sulcus is margined by a thin welt or lip. This is coarsely 
plicate transversely, the plica? extending to the welt. On the other side 
the transverse pliciB terminate at a band of tine longitudinal folds. In 
Ophisaurus the organ is undivided, and there is a welt with one edge 
and the proximal end free. It is covered with robust papilhe. 
The genera are otherwise characterized as follows: 

I. A premaxillary foramen; no lateral fold; anterior limb of interclavicle short. 

Anguinie. 

Rudimental posterior limbs (fpheodes VViigler. 

No rudiments of limbs Arujuis Linmeus.

notus, Mesaspis, Barissia. 

Palearctic genera: Anguis, Psendopus. 
Paleotropical genera: Dopasia.

I have examined the osteology of three exotic serpentiform genera,

liorly, and is recurved at tlie anterior apex, to c.outiniie as tiie slender 
procoracoid cartilage. 

Pelvic arch. — Three elements (used into one, as in the preceding 
genera, the distal elements forming a suboval plate; the ilium a short, 
curved rod, articulating proximally with a siugle robust diapophysis of 
a single vetebra. The whole structure is entirely lateral. 

Ohservations. — Dumeril and lUbron commit an erroj- in their figure of 
the Anguis fragilis, in representing the pelvic elements as meeting on 
the middle line below, which is far from being the case. Fiirbringer's 
figures are much more accurate. 

Opiieodes striatus iSpix. Partially described by Miiller,' imperfectly 
figured by Dumeril and Bibron,*^ and well described and ligured by 
Fiirbringer.-' South America. 

Scapular and pelvic arches present; no anterior limbs; posterior 
limbs present, rudimental. 

Scapular arch. — All the elements present; clavicles well developed; 
distally simple. Interclavicle aj>proximated to them, anchor-shaped, 
with very short posterior axis, which is widely separated from the 
sternum. Scapula, coracoid, and precoraeoid, osseous, confluent; no 
coracoid cartilage. Precoraeoid cartilage a slender rod, wedged be- 
tween the interclavicle and the clavicle. Sternum subtriangular, with 
shallow anterior notch, supporting two haemal ribs on each side. 

Pelvic arch. — All the elements present, the pubis and ischium not in 
contact on the median line. Ilium articulating below its middle with 
the confluent diapophyses of two vertebrje. Pubis about as long as 
ilium, the distal half rodlike, and separated from its fellow by a space 
equal to its length. It termimites in a short cartilaginous rod, which 
is directed forward ( ? epigastroid cartilage). The ischium is trans- 
verse in position, and somewhat expanded distally, sending forward a 
membranous sheet to the pubis. Posteriorly it gives origin to a car- 
tilaginous rod (liypogastroid) which speedily joins its fellow, and con- 
tinues with it as a double median cartilage, terminating acutely. This 
cartilage resembles that already described in Pygopus, where, how- 
ever, the two do not meet on the middle line. 

Posterior limb. — This is a little longer than the ilium. It consists of 
femur, tibia and fibula about two-thirds as long, and tarsal and meta- 
tarsal elements, all closely adherent. The former are three in number 
and the latter two. 

Observations. — In the figure by Dumeril and Bibron of the scapular 
arch the precoraeoid is omitted. The pelvis has been drawn from a 
dried specimen where the inferior arches have been divided and the 
lateral elements widely separated. The cartilages are not represented.

492 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Scapular arch. — luterclavicle wanting; clavicles present, osseous, 
meeting medially. Scapula cartilaginous; coracoid osseous. A large 
coracoid cartilage, which is continued proximally into the short and 
narrow precoracoid cartilage. Sternum without rib connections, of a 
transversely crescentic form, the convexity anterior, with some ossific 
deposit at the middle, on each side of the median line. 

Pelvic arch. — The three elements fused into a single piece, of which 
the ilium forms a slender proximal part and the distal elements an 
oval plate, concave anteriorly and convex posteriorly; the whole 
entirely lateral in position, and having a general resemblance to the 
corresponding parts of Ophisaiirus. Ilium short, its proximal extremity 
in contact with a very robust diapoi)hysis of a single vertebra. 

Observations. — The absence of the interclavicle Justifies the retention 
of the genus Dopasia Gray as distinct from Ophisaurus. I have 
examined two skeletons of the T). f/racilis and a half dozen of those 
of 0. ventralis. 

The characters of Ophisaurus are pointed out under that genus. 

The viscera do not display any exceptional features, except as to the 
serpentiform genera referred to under tlie head of Diploglossa. The 
mesenteries are of the typical character, modified in Ophisaurus by 
the reduction of the left lung. The hepato ventral sheet is very near 
the left margin of the liver in Pseudopus apus, and the gastrohepatic 
and right hepatic are near together when slack. 

OPHISAURUS Daudin.

Hyalinus Merrem, Tent. Amphib., 1820, j). 79. 

Body serpentiform, without external trace of limbs. A deep lateral 
groove from near head to anus. Scales hard, bony, in transverse 
series. An external ear, and scaly eyelids. Nostrils lateral, in a single 
plate. Tongue arrow-shaped, notched, and flat anteriorly, where it is free 
for about half its length. Palatine teeth. Tail much longer than body. 

The genus Ophisaurus is similar to the Gerrhonoti in essential charac- 
ters, but differs in the absence of limbs. The fold on each side is 
occupied by a soft skin which connects the dorsal and the ventral sheets 
of plates, the latter folding or lapping over the upper and concealing 
its lower edge. The plates on the body are quadrate and arranged in 
transverse series, the dorsal and ventral not corresponding in size and 
separated, as stated. On the tail the scales are in whorls, or bony rings, 
between which fractures occur very readily. 

In this genus the skeleton resembles in many respects GerrhonoUis, 
while presenting some important differences, which will be indicated 
below. Premaxillary with elongate spine above, and concave palatal 
margin interrupted by a short posteriorly produced angle on the middle

Hue. The nasals are elongate and distinct from each other. The frontal 
is narrow and double; its inferior lateral plates converge below, but 
are separated by a wide fissure. The i^arietal is rather elongate, and 
the pineal foramen is near its middle. The parieto-quadrate arches are 
horizontal, but well elevated above the occipital. The supraoccipital 
is so loosely articulated as not to touch the parietal, and it is separated 
by suture from the exoccipitals. The prefrontal is rather small and is 
not protuberant; it is not produced on the superior orbital border. 
The facial plate of the maxillary is large, and forms most of the lateral 
boundary of the nasals. The lachrymal is small and is barely reached 
by the narrow jugals. Postfrontal distinct, triradiate, the inferior 
limb shortest, the superior in contact equally, one with the frontal and 
one with the parietal. Infratemporal splint-like, very little in contact 
withjugal, separated by a narrow, slit from parietal, and entering for 
a considerable distance into the parieto-quadrate arch. Paroccipital 
exhibiting a narrow wedge from behind. Quadrate a deeply excavated 
external conch and a trace of the internal. Vomers elongate, each 
traversed by an elevated median keel; posterior ends separated by a 
deep notch, continuous with the rather narrow space which separates 
the palatines and the anterior part of the pterygoid. Narial fissure 
narrow, a portion cut off anteriorly as a small foramen by a lateral 
expansion of the vomer. A rather large foramen between maxillary 
and premaxillary. Maxillary process of palatine a little longer than 
vomerine process. Palatine foramen large; palatine bones rather nar- 
row. Pterygoids rather narrow, the contraction of the external border 
gradual. Ectopterygoid not decurved proximally. Sphenoid and 
basioccipital coossified ; lateral processes of latter compressed, concave 
posteriorly. Occipital condyle small, its tripartite composition faintly 
indicated. Epipterygoid arising just in front of basipterygoid, not 
reaching i^arietal, but resting on supraforaminal part of petrosal, which 
is longer than the infraforaminal jirocess. Tlie latter possesses a shal- 
low canal, which is presented externally behind. 

In the mandible Meckel's cartilage is concealed, except distally on 
the inferior face of the ramus. The external face of the coronoid is 
produced anteriorly only, and the dentary is produ(!ed posteriorly very 
little behind the line of its anterior angle. Angular mostly external; 
splenial elongate; articular and surangular fused on the external face 
of the ramus. The angle is horizontal, short, and rounded. 

The hyoid apparatus is characterized by the absence of second cera- 
tobranchials and free epibranchials. The first ceratobranchials are 
rather short. The hypobranchials are rather long, and the ceratohyals 
project a little beyond their extremity. The middle of the length of 
the ceratohyals is membranous. 

Scapular arch. — All the elements present, but more or less rudimental. 
Clavicles well developed, simple, and nearly meeting distally. Scapula 
cartilaginous, coracoid osseous, with a large cartilage which is pvo-

duced anteriorly and is continuous with the small cartilaginous procora- 
coid. Interclavicle posterior to the coracoid cartilages and overlapping 
the anterior border of the sternum; its anterior axis very short, the 
posterior still shorter. Sternum transverse, subcrescentic, cartilagi- 
nous, not supporting any ribs. 

In the cervical vertebne the odontoid process is sliort, and is coos- 
sified. There are six intercentra; the sixth low, the rest rather promi- 
nent. All the cervicals have ribs, except the axis and third. No zygo- 
spbene; prezysapopliysial faces not reflected on neural arch. Diapo- 
physes very short; neural spines moderately elevated, especially on 
cervical and caudal regions. On the latter they are rather narrow and 
stand at the posterior border of the neural arch, looking backward. 
At the anterior border is a second short spinous neural spine, which 
looks forward. A gap, which is roofed by membrane, separates the 
anterior from the i^osterior borders of the neural arches. The centrum 
is not segmented, but breaks very readily immediately behind the cup 
and in front of the diapophyses. Chevron bones coossified with the 
middles of the centra, and not interceutral. The centra, except at the 
ball-and-socket articulations, are quite as attenuated as the neural 
arches, whence their great fragility. 

Pelcic arch. — Ilium short, proximally in contact with a single ver- 
tebra, distaliy confluent with the rudimental pubis and ischium, which 
form together an oval plate, entirely lateral in position. 

Posterior limb. — This is an undivided short rod of cartilage, which is 
loosely articulated to the posterior concavity of the pelvic element, 
thus marking the position of the acetabulum. All the teeth simple and 
with acuminate apex. 

Besides the peculiarities resulting from the reduction of the extremi- 
ties, this genus differs from Gerrhonotun as follows: The presence of 
maxillopremaxillary foramen; the isolation of the anterior part of the 
posterior narial fissure as a foramen; the coossification of tlie sphenoid 
and basioccipital bones. The nonsegmentation of the caudal centra; 
the presence of two neural spines on them, and the very peculiar 
chevron bones. 

But one species of this genus is known. Boulenger unites the genera 
Pseiidopus, Hyalosaurus, and Bopasia with it; but Pseudopus and Hya- 
losaurus have posterior limbs, and I have shown that Dopasia has no 
interclavicle.^ Hyalosaurus also has the auricular meatus closed.

There is a large and broad oblong frontal plate, and behind it a pen- 
tagonal interparietal, bordered by an elongate parietal plate on each side. 
The interfrontouasal is half as long as the frontal. There are two

frontoparietals which are in contact with the fonrth sdpraocular plate. 
There are two series of plates, supraorbitals and superciliaries, along 
the edge of the head, above the eye. The eyelids are distinct, the lower 
well covered with scales. There are two pairs of interuasals and a 



496 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

series of three more plates (one azygoua) between them and the rostral. 
The nostril perforates a single small nasal plate. The space between 
this and the eye is occupied by two rows of five plates, with two other 
rows in a line above these posteriorly. Labials either bordering orbit, 
or more frequently separated by one or two rows of scales. Ten upper 
labials. Ears a short longitudinal closed slit or foramen of varying 
size in line between the mouth and lateral groove. 

There are sixteen longitudinal series of plates in the dorsal sheet, 
the outer on each side the narrower, and ten in the ventral, the outer 
narrower; 126 in series from head to tail. The central six rows on the 
back have a distinct though blunt cariiiation, almost inappreciable on 
the next rows; the rest of the lateral and all the ventral perfectly 
smooth. Tail very long. Seven or eight i)reanal scales, a little larger 
than the abdominal. 

The color in most specimens from the Atlantic States is a very dark, 
greenish olive above; x)Osterior border (in the corners) of each scale, with 
two bluish or greenish white rounded spots. The central line of each 
series, especially where traversed by the ridge, is darker than the 
ground color and not spotted. The under parts are plain greenish 
white. The top and sides of the liead are spotted like the back. 

A few Atlantic specimens have the central eight or nine rows of 
scales brownish or olivaceous yellow, the checkeis or tessellation of 
the first variety showing through either irregularly or as transverse 
bands of black spotted with white. In many specimens three stripes 
above the fold on each side may be indistinctly outlined, while in otliers 
the three stripes may be perfectly distinct. Tliese may be reduced to 
two or even one stripe, and occasionally traces of a fourth may be 
present. With these may or may not be associated a median dorsal 
stripe. 

There are considerable variations in the sqiiamation of this species. 
The most usual is that which concerns the contact of the interfronto- 
nasal with the frontal. This contact is rarely wide, is frequently 
narrow, and less frequently does not exist, the prefrontals being in con- 
tact on the middle line. I exbibit this and the presence of two inter- 
frontonasals in the following table: 

I. Oue iuterfroutonasal. 

A. Iiit(;rfroutonasal broadlj' ia coutact with frontal; Cat. No. 15537 (a), half-

Nos. 14142 (2 spec); 5322, 15537 (b) adult; 12783, 13809, 4985, 9360. 

C. No contact between frontal and iuterfrontonasal; Cat. Nos. 32i)l, 20811, 9358 

(young), 15537 (c) adult; 5731 half-grown; 5130, 16949, 10584. 

II. Two intorfrontonasals, anterior and posterior. 

Anterior interfrontouasal fused with right posterior intornasal; Cat. No. 10584. 
Anterior interfroutonasal distinct, Cat. No. 21359. 

The degree of the carination of the scales varies considerably, but it 
is generally more conspicuous in the young than in the adult. Usually a

tow of scales separates the labials from the eye, and sometimes there 
are t\v:o rows. In the type of the var. sulcatm one labial enters the eye 
border, and in Cat. No. Iil359 two labials enter it. 
The color varieties may be i)resented in the following form: 

I. Lateral scales of the body with sjiots. 

A. Dorsal scales spotted like laterals ; Cat. Nos. 9350, 9358, aud 208n.

C. Spots OQ three lateral rows; a median dorsal stripe, connected with lateral 

spots by cross-bauds; Cat. No. 5322.

complete dorsal cross-bands in a specimen from Gotha, Orange County, 
Florida.

J. One lateral stripe and oue dorsal; Cat. No. 10584. 
K. One lateral stripe and no dorsal ; Cat. No. 21359. 

Besides the stripes mentioned nuder II, there is sometimes a feeble 
one on the superior row of abdominal scales. Many specimens also 
have vertical pale bars with a dark posterior border on the side of the 
body from the ear for a varying but not long distance posteriorly. Such 
are Cat. Nos. 8978, 3201 , 5129, 9357, 0073, 5089, 6419, 51 35, 5138, 5130, 92C0, 
12754, 12783, 13G85. 

It now remains to be ascertained what indications these variations 
in squamation and coloration present of specilic or subspecific value. 
In the first place, it is to be observed that the greater number of indi- 
viduals are grouped into two color types, which are marked in the above 
list by the letters B and I, or the checkered and the striped patterns, 
respectively. Do any other characters accord with these conspicuous 
color varieties? I quoted on a former occasion the manuscript remark 
of Professor Baird that the western variety of this species has but 14 
rows of scales, as distinguished f.om the eastern type with 10 rows, 
and that he called the former by the subspecific name of attcnuaius^ 
I might have added that Professor Baird in his manuscript regarded 
the striped form as predominatingly western and the checkered type 
as eastern. Dr. Boulenger - has adopted this form as a distinct !~pe-

cies, giving as a further definition that the ear opening is not larger 
than the nostril, while in the 0. ventralis it is muoh larger. 

An examination of the localities from which the color varieties above 
mentioned were derived shows that no well-defined specimens of the 
checkered variety have been sent from west of the Mississippi River, 
and that all from that region are striped. It shows, also, that the 
striped coloration occurs also east of the Mississippi in Illinois, North 
Carolina, South Carolina, and that it is abundant in Florida. It also 
shows that the striped form is not characterized by a smaller number of 
scales than the checkered form, nor do the trans-Mississippians have 
even generally 14 rows of scales. Thus, I find in Cat. No. 93G0, from 
Kansas, IG rows; Cat. No. 4985, Arkansas, 16 rows; Cat. No. 3201, south- 
western Texas, 16 rows; Wichita, Texas, E. D. Cope, 14 rows; Dallas, 
Texas, E. D. Cope, 16 rows. The size of the auricular meatus is very 
variable. I have seen it as small as the nostril in only one specimen, 
and that is Cat. No. 10584, from Clearwater, Florida, of the striped

variety, and with 16 rows of scales. In some specimens it is nearly as 
long as the eye slit; in many others it is only half as long, etc. 

I do not find the subspecies attenuatns Baird, or species, according 
to Boulenger, to be well founded. The subspecies sulcatus Cope, from 
Dallas, Texas, stands on no better foundation. The interfrontonasal 
is broadly in contact with the frontal, but this character occurs in a 
good many others, both checkered and striped, and is variable in speci- 
mens from the same locality (Cat. No. 15537). The second row of super- 
ciliary scales is represented by a half row in many specimens, and the 
one labial plate in the orbit is matched by Cat. No. 10584 from Clear- 
water, Florida. The carination of the scales is greater than usual, but 
the specimen is young and would have become, with age, as smooth as 
some of those before me. 

The only specimen which diverges widely enough from the type to 
require mention is Cat. No. 21359, which is, however, approached by 
Cat. No. 14724. 

I give a more detailed description of an individual of the striped type. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARD8, AND SNAKES. 499 

Body slender, contained two and one-third times in tlie tail; dorsal 
scales in fourteen longitudinal series; ventral in ten; and one hundred 
and twenty from head to anus. The carination of the dorsal scales is 
conliued chiefly to the two median rows, although it is obsoletely visi- 
ble on ten rows on each side of these. There is a conspicuous broad, 
but shallow groove along the back between these ten median cariuse. 
Tlie head is very narrow, as high as broad. 

The ground color is a light olive green, or greenish gray above, with 
a median and five lateral (on each side) nearly equal stripes of dark 
brown (or sides brown with four narrow white lines). The median 
occupies the space between the dorsal carinte. Then comes an olive 
strii)e of If rows, and then a brown stripe. For the rest of the lateral 
series there is a narrow, well-defined stripe of whitish in the central 
fifth; tlie space between these lines is brown. These markings are 
equally distinct on the tail, which has the stripes continued a little 
below the level of those on the sides, though continuous with those 
above the lateral groove. Near the head the dusky lateral stripes are 
divided transversely by whitish lines, the sides of the head checkered 
likewise. The under parts are greenish white. 

The predominance of the fourteen rows of scales in the lineated 
Western glass snake, in distinction from the sixteen of the mere check- 
ered eastern form, appears to be well marked, at least in large specimens. 
This is the case with Cat. No. 3193, from St. Louis, and a small one from 
Knoxville, Tennessee, differing only in having the clay-colored strij)e, 
on each side the dorsal brown one, 2| instead of If scales wide. The 
latter was associated with a large one of the Atlantic type, with six- 
teen series of scales. 

I did not observe this species in southwestern Texas, but obtained 
it from near Dallas. The specimens are of the Western variety, with 
only fourteen rows of dorsal scuta, or the subspecies attenuatus of 
Baird. A specimen from the same locality is similar in tlie characters 
named, but is remarkable for the strong carination of its superior 
Scales. The carina) are elevated on the ten median rows, so as to leave 
sulci between them. On the posterior part of the body the keels extend 
to the lateral rows, and on the tail even to the inferior surface. There 
are only ten superior labial scuta, and no postparietals. The infracan- 
thal row extends over the eye, giving three rows between the latter 
and the frontal plate. I am not sure that these characters are con- 
stant, so I note this form under the varietal name of sulcatus. It is 
described from a half-grown animal. 

The osteology of this species has been described by Miiller,' Dumeril 
and Bibron,^ Cope-' (scapular arch in i)art), Fiirbringer,^ and Shufeldt.^

and Bibron is very defective in proportious. The posterior limb rudi- 
meut is not shown in tlie pelvic arch. This is figured by Slmfeldt,' 
but he omits the interclavicle from the scapular arch. The pelvic 
elements and limb are well figured by Miiller.- Fiirbringer's descrip- 
tion is good, but he overlooks the rudimeutal femur. 

This "glass snake" is a rapacious feeder, living principally on the 
numerous Arthropoda which abound in the regions it inhabits. I took 
from the stomach of a specimen from Florida three ground spiders 
C? Lycosa sp.), a grasshopper, a cricket, a cockroach, a coleopterous and 
a lepidopterous larva, and a small snail. Its large intestine was packed 
with the fragments of coleoptera. It feeds readily in confinement, 
taking insects from the hand. If the insect is not promptly given up 
to it when seized, it will pull and struggle to secure it, as a dog will 
try to get a stick away from the hand of his master.

OPHISAURUS VENTRALIS COMPRESSUS Cope. 

This subspecies is fomided on a single individual, Oat. Xo. 21359, from 
the coast of South Carolina. Were it not for the existence of a few 
specimens in a few respects intermediate between this form and the 
ordinary one, there could be no doubt of its full specific distinctness. 
Its characters are so peculiar that the least that can be accorded it is 
the rank of subspecies. 

In the first place, the typical and only specimen has two interfrontona- 
sal plates, one anterior to the other. This character is partly developed 
in only one other specimen. Cat. ISTo. 10581, from Florida. Two labial 
plates border the orbit below. These are separated by one or two rows 
from the orbit in all the 
si^ecimens except in the 
type of the var. sulca- 
tus from Dallas, Texas, 
Avhere one labial enters 
the orbit. A marked 
peculiarity is the com 
piession of the head, 
body, and tail. The 
body is higher than 
wide, and the dorsal 
surface is narrow roof- 
shaped. The tail is 
more prominent on the 
middle line below tlian 
on the dorsal line, al- 
though the latter has 
not the flat character of 
other individuals. In 
fact this compression is 
absolutely unique in the 
genus, the typical va- 
riety being flat-backed 
throughout the length. 
Another peculiarity of 
this specimen is the narrowness of the caudal scales, which are longer 
than wide, conspicuously so beyond the basal region. They are as 
wide as long, or even wider in the ordinary variety. The scales of 
the upper surfaces are in fourteen rows, of which only twelve are visi- 
ble above the lateral fold. They are angulate roof-shaped, and are not 
keeled. There are only two rows of scales between the canthal row 
and the superior labials; in the ordinary form there are three. The 
prefrontals are broadly in mutual contact, as in a few other specimens, 
as Cat. Ko. 10584. The auricuhir fissure is about two-thirds the length 
of the eye fissure.

Measurements. — Total length, 6GS mm.; head and body, 185 mm.; to 
angle of mouth, 18 mm. 

The coloration is also peculiar, as already pointed out in the color 
table, this specimen being the only example of group K. The ground 
color of the anterior half of the body above the lateral fold with the 
head above the mouth is black; each scale, except some of those of the 
vertebral line, with one or more white centers, No vertical bands ante- 
riorly; cephalic plates with white spots on thin borders. From the 
middle of the length of the body the black rapidly fades to brown, and 
the light spots disappear, while the edges of the scales are paler than 
their centers. About the middle third of the length of the body a 
black stripe appears, which covers the adjacent halves of the third 
and fourth rows of scales above the lateral fold, and extends thence 
with sharply defined borders to near the end of the tail. Below this 
band the color is uniform straw colored. Belly, throat, and chin the 
same. 

The only specimen which resembles this one in color is Oat. No. 
10581, from Florida, already mentioned, which has one lateral stripe. 
But it has also a median dorsal stripe, and the anterior half of the 
body and head are straw colored, as in the striped forms generally. 

It is only the existence of Cat. No. 10581 that has restrained me from 
regarding the form compressus as a distinct species. And that speci- 
men has the normal form of body and tail and of scales. It is possible 
that that specimen is a hybrid between the two subspecies compressus 
and ventralis.

Cehstus Gray, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., II, 1837, p. 288; Cat. Liz. Brit. Mus., 1st 

ed., 1845, p. 117.— Cope, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Pliila., 1868, p. 123.

No lateral tegumentary fold. Digits 5-5. Prefrontal and inter- 
frontonasal plates fused. 

This genus is regarded as not distinct from Diploglossus by some 
authors. In the latter the iuterfrontoiiasal and the two prefrontals 
are not united, and the character is, in my estimation, amply sufficient 
to separate it from Celestus. The latter is related to it as Mesaspis is 
to Gerrohonotus, and both these genera exhibit the first stage of the 
fusion of cephalic plates which terminates in the simple condition seen 
in Anniella and other genera.

The greater number of species of this geuus is West Indian, and no 
species has been found in continental South America. Three species 
occur in Central America, one of them, C. emieagrammus Cope, on the 
southern borders of the Mexican Plateau, and thus coming within the 
scope of this work; and two, C. hilohatus O'Shaughnessy, and C. cijano- 
chloris Cope,' in the high mountains of Costa llica. This genus is one 
of the few which occur in both the West Indian and Central American 
regions. The genus ])i2)IoglossHs occurs in tropical South America and 
in southern Central America.

Dorsal scales striated, not keeled. Rostral not quite so wide as the 
genial. Interfroutouasal large, irregularly jientagonal. Frontal louger 
than wide. Frontoparietals present. Nasal scute in contact with the 
rostral. Two postnasals superposed. Two or three loreals, the anterior 
often obliquely divided. A i)reocular. A snbocular. Maxillary teeth 
with trilobate crowns. Trunk encircled with thirty-two to thirty-eight 
longitudinal series of scales, averaging thirty-six at the middle of the 
body. This species, like Diploglossus Mlohatus, has the limbs well 
developed. It differs from that species in many particulars, especially 
in the shape of the cephalic plates. 

Length of head from the end of the muzzle to the posterior border of 
the occipital jdate equals about twelve dorsal scales, and is one-seventh 
of the distance between the chin and the cloaca. The second pair of 
supranasals (or prefrontonasals) are large and directed obliquely out- 
ward. The interfrou to nasal is wider than it is long and articulates 
with the posterior concave border of the frontal. Frontal relatively 
long, narrower in front than behind. Five supraoculars, of which the 
second is wide in front and is in contact along that side with the inter- 
froutouasal. The nasal, somewhat lengthened, is pierced posteriorly. 
Postnasals small, quadrilateral, and superposed. Of the three loreals, 
the middle one, when present, is the largest, and is pushed upward on 
the muzzle, extending above the canthus rostralis and rarely reaching 
the labials. Postloreal square, followed by a small median preocular. 
Finally, the subocular represents a very long rectangle. The supra- 
labials, ten on each side, of which the seventh and eighth, not so deep 
as the others, support the subocular scute; the ninth is small and pen- 
tagonal; the tenth, still smaller but similar in outline, is succeeded by 
scutella similar to those on the cheek, which extend to the ear. Eight 
pairs of inferior labials. Rostral not quite so large as the genial. The 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 505 

postgenial precedes three pairs of submaxillary ])lates, first pair of 
Avhicli are in contact along their internal sides, 

Tiie trunk is depressed, of medium length, covered with scales, 
which form thirty-four longitudinal series; the median dorsal series is 
composed of seventy-seven scutella, counting from the nape of the 
neck to the posterior level of the thighs. Scales on the under surface 
of the body smooth, but those on the back and sides are striated, hav- 
ing sixteen strife. Preanals are i)olygonal, not exceeding in size the 
ones which ])recede them. Scales of the normal region of the tail sim- 
ilar to those on the body; those on reproduced portions are distinctly 
keeled, forming by contact long prominent lines. Limbs relatively well 
develoi)ed; length of arm to the end of the middle finger more than 
one-third longer than the head. Toes of unequal length, the fifth of 
each foot being the longest. 

MeafiurcmcntH. — Total length, 204 mm.; length of body fi'om chin to 
anus, 112 mm.; length of tail, 92 mm.; length of head from the end of 
the muzzle to the posterior border of the occipital, IC mm.; length of 
head from the end of the muzzle to the anterior border of the ear, 17 
mm. ; length of head to the level of the temples, 13 mm. ; length of arm 
to the extremity of the middle finger, 23 mm.; length of leg to the 
extremity of the longest toe, 30 mm. 

General tint olive yellow; three wide, longitudinal, brown bands 
extend along the back and sides, the middle one, beginning at the 
muzzle to the anterior part of the tail, is distinguished from the two 
lateral by narrow lines of golden yellow, or, in young specimens, blue; 
its width comprises nine series of scales, each of which has the central 
longitiulinal line. The lateral bands are thickly strewn on the neck 
and Hanks with small yellow circular spots rimmed with dark violet, the 
elVect being that of a black and yellow trellis. The dorsal scales have 
their borders brown. The cheeks and lower surfaces of the body are 
briglit yellow, exccjjt tlie throat, which is of a pale tint of the same color. 

Six specimens of this species are before me, all from the Orizaban 
district of the Toltecan subregion, except one from Costa Rica. (See 
chapter on geographical distribution.) All have two i)reloreals, one 
above the other, except one. In one of the former the supraloreal 
extends down to the superior labial plates between the pre-and post- 
loreals on one side only, an evident anomaly. In the specimen with but 
one i)reloreal I proposed the species C. chalyha'us. This specimen has 
apparently fewer longitudinal rows of scales than the others, but I find 
that the apparent number of scales depends on the locality in which 
they are counted. Thus the type of D. cJudyhaus has thirty-four rows 
on the posterior part of the body and forty on the anterior jiart. Other 
specimens display the same character. This explains the discrepancies 
in the figures given by authors. This species was first described from 
a young example from Jalapa in the museum of the Philadelphia 
Academy. Specimens in the museums of Loudon and Paris are from 
the plateau of Guatemala.

Scales of body in compact dorsal aud ventral sheets, separated by a 
lateral Interval of soft skin, and arranged in transverse series; those 
of the tail in bony rings or whorls. Throat \Yithout fold ; external ears 
distinct; head above ^vith rather regular plates. Limbs weak, short; 
anterior scarcely smaller than posterior, all with five digits terminated 
by short claws nearly concealed by a sheath of two scales. ISTostrils 
lateral ; no femoral pores. 

Osteology. — A skeleton of the G. mulUcarinatus from the U. S. National 
Museum furnishes the material for the osteology of this genus. 

The premaxillary has a well-developed spine and a truncate palatal 
border. Its alveolar border is short, and it forms but a small part of 
the inferior uarial border. Nasal bones not short in front, rather nar- 
rowed by the maxillary and prefrontals on each side. Frontal narrow, 
single, partly inclosing olfactory lobes of the brain below, but the 
incurved lateral walls not touching. Parietal with small pineal fora- 
men far behind coronal suture. Supraoccipital loosely articulated, and 
separated by suture from exoccipitals. Prefrontal not tuberiferous, 
produced posterior to middle of supraorbital border. Postfrontal cres- 
centic, equally united with frontal and ])arietal. Postorbital splint- 
shaped, with very slight contact with the jugal, and long contact with 
the supratemporal. Jugal slender, reaching anteriorly the small lach- 
rymal. Paroccipital narrowly exposed posteriorly, well produced 
upward on the distinct parietoquadrate arch. Quadrate with one 
deeply excavated conch, whicli is external. Vomers in close apposition 
in front, separated by a fissure posteriorly; the anterior portion exca- 
vated medially. Palatines descending from the plane of the vomers; 
the vomerine and maxillary processes about equal; main plate rather 
narrow. Palatine foramen large. Pterygoid contracting gradually into 
posterior slender portion; basipterygoid well developed. Presphenoid 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 507 

wanting. Sphenoid and basioccipital separated by suture; descending 
tuberosities of the latter strong, compressed. Epipterygoid originating 
below opposite basii)terygoid ; above resting on anterior process of 
petrosal, and toucliiug parietal Just behind au obtuse descending angle 
of the decurved border of the same. Subforaminal portion of petrosal 
shorter than supraforaminal portion, inclosing a very narrow down- 
looking groove. Basioccipital and exoccipitals coossified; condyle 
small, simple. 

Meckel's canal closed except distally, where it is open on the under 
side of the ramus. Corouoid developed anteriorly on external face of 
ramus, the dentary not reaching behind its anterior border. Splenial 
elongate, partly external; angular mostly external; surangular con- 
fluent w ith articular. Angle horizontal, incurved, with rounded border 
and concave superior surface. 

Hyoid apparatus displays no second and rather short first ceratobran- 
chials. Hypohyal rather long, the ceratohyal extending a little beyond 
its extremity, and widened at the posterior third. A free epibranchial, 
which has a bifurcate anterior extremity at that of the ceratohyal, and 
extends posteriorly but little behind the ceratobranchial. 

Five cervical intercentra, and two cervicals besides atlas without ribs. 
The odontoid is coossitied with the axis. Eibs extend to sacrum. 
Sacral diapophyses distinct from each other. Dorsal vertebra? without 
zygosphen, prezygapophyseal facets not continued on neural arch. 
Caudal diapophyses present; centraof middle region segmented through 
tliem ; chevron bones intercentral. Neural spines low, higher on caudal 
region. 

Suprascapula much larger than scapula; no proscapula. One large 
coracoid notch. Sternum without fontanelle, with three ribs and two 
attached to xiplioid rod. 

Ilium without prominent angulus crisUe; acetabulum entire; j)ubes 
uniting at an acute angle; pectineal angle medium. Ischia with promi- 
nent tuber. 

The detailed common characters of this genus will be found more 
fully among the si^ecific description. The chief peculiarity is in the fold 
or strip of soft skin on each side, usually covered by the overlapping of 
the lower sheet on the upper. The dorsal scales are arranged in trans- 
verse series on each side, which pass a little obliquely backward on 
the back, so as to meet at an obtuse angle and not always evenly. The 
Scales of the tail are in thick bony rings, easily separating, so that it is 
very rare to see a specimen which has not lost its tail and had it repro- 
duced. In this case the indications of length afforded by the stump 
are very uncertain, and have given rise to grave errors in framing spe- 
cific characters. It is probable that in none is it less than one and one- 
half or one and three-fourth times the head and body. 

In the North American species there are always twelve longitudinal 
rows of ventral scales, and fourteen to sixteen dorsal; the latter usually 



508 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

cariiiuted. The trausverse series on each side vaiy from thirty-nine to 
fifty-two. The head plates are quite symmetrical; their general char- 
acter will be found detailed under G. muUicarinatiis. The variations are 
in the size of the large median frontal and of the outer nasals; the 
number of the postnasals, whether two, three, or four; and the outer 
row of supraorbitals, whether three or two. 

Young individuals are much more brilliantly colored than adults and 
have a more distinct color pattern of alternating light and dark cross- 
bars. On young individuals were proposed the species G. cceruleus and 
G. webbii. The colors fade out with maturity in most of the species, 
becoming shades of olive or brown with lateral bars, or if brilliant 
colors are retained as in G. gramineus and G. auritus, the crossbars 
disappear. 

There is considerable irregularity in the scales of the head in some 
of the species, which renders it necessary to analyze closely their 
homologies. Between the prefrontals and the internasals on each side 
of the median or interfrontonasal plate there may be one, two, or three 
plates. When there is one, it generally meets its mate of the opposite 
side in front of the interfrontonasal. This plate is the prefrontonasal. 
Sometimes, as G. auritus or G. liocephalus, there may be another pair of 
prefrontonasals, which mayor may not meet in front of the interfronto- 
nasal. In addition to these there may be another, generally smaller, 
plate, which lies between the interfrontonasal and loreal on each side, 
which I call the lateral prefrontonasal. This never meets its mate of 
the other side, but is sometimes fused on one or the other side with the 
prefrontonasal. On the side of the muzzle there may be one or two 
scales between the nasal and internasal, the supranasals. Posterior to 
the nasal there may be one or two plates in contact with it, one above 
the other, the postnasals. Immediately in front of the eyes there are 
two lilates, one above and one below, the preoculars, which may rarely 
be fused. Between these and the postn;isals^or nasals when postnasals 
are absent, is one or two plates, the anterior and posterior loreals. 
When there is but one plate between the nasal and the postloreal, it is 
sometimes difficult to determine whether it is the preloreal or the post- 
nasal. In the case of G. burnettii I do not know which it is. It is 
probably preloreal, since in the allied G. multicarinatus the inferior post- 
nasal is sometimes wanting. 

The typical characters of the head ijlates are important as definitive 
of the species, but their variations render it necessary to rely on other 
characters. The Sonoran and Western forms are more difficult to dis- 
tinguish than the Toltecan. I append the following key, which will 
aid in their determination :

Above, bright pea green, each transverse series of scales blackish at 
the base and yellowish at the tips ; rugosities of all scales black. Below, 
pale green, with a reddish tint in some, gular region and lower jaw 
yellow, abruptly separated from the green of the neck; eyelids yellow. 

Measurements. — Length of head and body, 105 mm.; length of head, 
inclusive of postoccijDital plate, 27 mm. ; width of head at temporal 
region, 23 mm.; length to axilla, 44 mm.; length of fore leg, 32 mm.; 
length of fore foot, 13 mm.; length of hind leg, 40 mm.; length of hind 
foot, 19 mm.: total length of smaller specimen, with tail, 215 mm.; 
length of tail of small specimen, 130 mm. 

This species has been found so far only in the elevated forests of the 
region about the volcano of Orizaba or Citlaltepetl. Its coloration is 
handsome, and is calculated to conceal it in forest vegetation. The 
same style of coloration characterizes the Gerrhonotus auritv^ Cope, 
which inhabits similar situations on the plateau of Guatemala. While 
referring to this species I correct an error into which Boulenger has 
inadveiteutly fallen in describing this species. He distinguishes it 
from the Barissia Jimbriata Cope, which resembles it in the elongate 
yellow preauricular processes, by the presence of " three pairs of shields 
between the frontal and the rostral," while the B. Jimhriata has "four 
l)airs of shields." Now the 6'. auritus has four i)airs of shields between 
the frontal and the rostral plates, and in my original description I 
stated that the second pair of internasals is divided — that is, there are 
two pairs of prefrontonasals. These, with the internasals, are exclusive 
of the prefrontals.

border of the tympanum fiirnislied with flat or slightly convex scales. 
Oue pair of prefrontonasals and two small supranasals. Nine to ten 
pairs of supi^ilabials. Mental divided. Dorsal scales larger than the 
veutrals and slightly swollen longitudinally. Lateral fold inconspicu- 
ous. Tail of medium length. General color greenish yellow, with wide 
black transverse bands. 

Head flat above, depressed in the occipital region, covered with 
scales having the surface finely rugose; length from the end of the 
muzzle to the middle of the auricular opening equaling seven or eight 
rows of dorsal scales, and entering four and one-third times into the 
space comprised between the chin and the anus. Muzzle short, having 
two internasal scutes and two small supranasals; the two internasals 
are in contact in front with the rostral, and on each side with the first 
supralabial; the two prefrontonasals, of much larger dimension, are 
hexagonal; the interfroutonasal, which is smaller, is quadrilateral and 
is in contact in front with the two preceding, and behind with the pre- 
frontals. The supranasals, very small, are situated oue to the right, 
the other to the left, between the preceding scutes and the nasal scale. 
The i)refrontals are hexagonal and are smaller than the prefrontonasals. 
The frontal is relatively short, obtusely angled in front, with a sharp 
XDOsterior angle, which is truncate at the extremity by the interparietal, 
which is rather large, and is in contact in front with the frontal and 
the frontoparietal, on each side with a large parietal, and behind with 
three very narrow occipitals. The latter are followed by two rows of 
convex nuchal scales. Each of the supraocular demicircles is protected 
by eight projecting scales (five large and three exceedingly small) and 
is bordered exteriorly by a series of fine superciliary scales, of which 
the first is more developed than the others. Nostril pierced in the 
posterior part of the nasal plate; this latter is subrectangular and is in 
contact before with one of the internasals; above with the supranasal 
and upi)er nasoloreal, below with the first two supralabial plates, and 
behind with the inferior postnasal. 

The loreal scutellum is rhomboidal and rests on a part of the third 
and fourth supralabial; the second loreal is large and irregularly hex- 
agonal; the preocular is subquadrilateral and precedes two suboculars. 
There are nine or ten supralabials; the first seven or eight are ([uadri- 
lateral, the following, rather higher, is pentagonal, and the last, a long 
one, has a sharp angle directed backward; the nine pairs of inferior 
labials are well developed. Aperture of the ear triangular, overhung 
by the projecting temporals, and bordered in front by three or four 
small convex scales and behind by Sfaly grains. Mental divided and 
succeeded on the right and left by four plates ; those of the first pair 
in contact on their inner borders, and the outer borders of all separated 
from the inferior labials by one row of scales. The throat scales are 
flat and closely resemble those on the breast; on the sides of the neck 
they are tubercular; but the region above, between the ear and arm, is

covered with line grauuhilious. Lateiiil folds well uuirked, each start- 
iug- ill front of the arm and ttrmiiiatiiig at the side of the cloaca. 
Dorsal scales subqnadrilateral, surmounted by a slight longitudinal 
ridge, forming thirteen or fourteen longitudinal series and twenty-five 
to twenty seveu transverse ones from the nape of the neck to the pos- 
terior border of tbe thighs; the cervical series contain but four scales, 
and not six, as in G. tccniatns. The ventral plates are quite small, and 
form fourteen longitudinal series at the middle of the trunk. Cloaca 
bordered with four scales, slightly larger than those which precede 
them. Tail one third longer than the head and trunk, encircled with 
twenty-six whorls of scales. Limbs similar to those of G. tceuiatus, 
both in dimensions and scaling. 

Measurements. — Total length, 250 mm.; length of head from end of 
muzzle to the middle of ear, 23 mm.; length of head to border of 
temples, 18 mm.; length of body from chin to anus, 111 mm.; length 
of tail, 139 mm.; length of arm to the extremity of the middle finger, 
20 mm.; length of leg to the extremity of the longest toe, 32 mm. 

General tint, a greenish yellow; on the neck and trunk are six trans- 
verse black bands, very wide on the upper parts, and narrow on the 
sides where thej* Join and disappear on the belly. On the tail the 
bands are very wide above, and becon:e faint, narrow lines on the under 
side. The top of the head is ocher yellow, but the small, tlexible pro- 
tuberances on the scales are dark brown. The sides of the neck, from 
the temporal region to the junction of the arm, are black; there are 
small black spots on the supralabials, another spot, starting behind 
the eye, extending oblicpiely backward and downward. Lower sur- 
faces of the body yellow, and the bases of the abdominal scales 
blackish, 

M. Bocourt distinguishes this species from G. ttviiiatus by the fol- 
lowing peculiarities: The temporal and nuchal plates are more piomi- 
neiit, and present the appearance of grains of maize; the lateral scales 
of the neck and throat are larger and tubercular, while on the reginn 
above, from the ear to the junction of the arm, the scales are small and 
granular; linally, the first cervical series is composed of four elevated 
scales, and not six Hat ones, (iiinther distinguishes it from the G. 
gramineus, with which Bocourt confounded it, by the following charac- 
ters: The sides of the neck arecov<,'red with large irregular scales, sep- 
arated from the nuchal scales by a naked span, with few granules; no 
granular scales in the lateral fold; dorsal scales considerably smaller, 
that is, in more numerous rows; ventrals smaller and more numerous. 

Bocourt received this species from Mount Orizaba, where Sumi- 
chrast found it at an elevation of 3,000 meters. He also reports it from 
Oaxaca, whence also (iiinther has it. No specimens contained in the 
U. !S. National iMuseum.

Head flat on top; wide behind and covered in the temporal regions 
with convex scales. Nasal scute separated from the rostral. Upper 
edge of the tympanum bordered with granular scales. One pair of 
prefrontonasal plates, a pair of internasals, and a supranasal. Eleven 
or twelve pairs of supralabials. Mental divided. Dorsal scales show- 
ing a slight longitudinal swelling, and larger than the ventral plates. 
Lateral fold small. Tail of medium length. Color greenish gray, with 
transverse bands of dark green. 

Head rounded in the temporal region and covered with finely rugose 
scales; length to the middle of the auricular opening equal to eight 
dorsal scales, and entering four times and a half into the space from 
the chin to the anus. Muzzle covered with seven scales; the two inter- 
nasals in contact with each other and anteriorly with the rostral and 
on each side with the first supralabial. The prefrontonasal is larger 
and is hexagonal. The interfrontonasal is eijually large, and is hex- 
agonal and in contact T^ith six plates; in front with the prefrontonasals, 
behind with the two prefrontals, and on each side with the upper loreal 
jdate, which in this species is recurved on the upper border of the 
muzzle. The supranasal is rectangular in outline, and is placed to the 
right and left above the nasal scute; the prefrontals are irregularly 
hexagonal, and each of them articulates behind with the frontal; the 
latter is relatively short, is obtuse-angled in front and sharply so at 
the back, with the point truncate and in contact with a narrow lozenge- 
shaped interparietal. The latter is in contact with six scutes; in front 
with the preceding and with two frontoparietals, on each side with a 
large parietal, and behind with the occipital. The occipital is in con- 
tact, right and left, with a postparietal scale, and is followed by two 
ranks of nuchal scales. There are five supraocular plates, which 
embrace three or four smaller scales between themselves and the sui)er- 
ciliaries. The temples are prominent and are covered with convex 
scales. Nostril opening pierced at the jjosterior part of the nasal 
plate; the latter in contact anteriorly with the first labial plate and 
wi;h the internasal; above with a small supranasal, below with the 
second supralabial, and behind with two small superposed nasoloreals. 
These latter are in front of one loreal or two superposed, of which the 
toi) one is the smaller and is recurved on the upper face of the muz- 
zle; the freno-ocular is large and irregularly hexagonal; the lower 
side, rather narrow, rests on the fifth supralabial; the subquadrilateral

preocular is followed by three small subociilars. There are eleven or 
twelve supralabials; the first uine quadrilateral; the sixth, which is 
the highest, in contact with the preocular; and the three last larger 
and pentagonal. Auricular opening triangular, overhung by the tem- 
poral region and bordered in front and above by granular scales. 
Inferior labials in nine pairs; mental divided and followed on the 
right and left by four submaxillary jilates arranged as in G. deppii 
and separated from the inferior labials by a row of longitudinal scales. 
The throat is covered with scales similar to those on the breast; those 
on the sides are smaller, and the region between the ear and the arm 
is covered with granular scales. Lateral fold slightly indicated, com- 
mencing on each side in front of the arm and ending at the cloaca. 
Dorsal scales subquadrilateral, with a slight longitudinal swelling, and 
forming fifteen longitudinal series, and from twenty-eight to twenty- 
nine transverse ones from the nape of the neck to the posterior border 
of the thighs; the cervical series are composed of six scales. Abdomi- 
nal plates small, constituting twelve longitudinal rows; the anal 
region is bordered with six scales, of which the lateral ones are very 
small. Tail a little longer than the body and head and with eighty- 
five rings of smooth scales. Limbs relatively h)nger than those of G. 
deppii, but covered with similar scales. Claws short and hooked. 

Mea,sureinent,s. — Total length of type specimen, figured by Wiegmann, 
L'lG mm.; length of head, from end of muzzle to middle of car, 20 mm.; 
width of head at the borders of the temples, 10 mm.; length of body, 
from chin to anus, 88 mm.; length of tail, 128 mm,; length of arm, to 
the end of the middle finger, 24 mm.; length of leg, to the end of the 
longest toe, 28 mm. 

iSTeck and trunk a bright green with seven transverse brown bands, 
which are a little wider on the vertebral region than on the sides. 
The tail has fifteen bands of the same color. The upper surface of 
the head shows the color deepened to a greenish gray, and the tem- 
ples are crossed obliquely by a black band. The inferior regions are 
yellow. 

M. Bocourt, from whom the preceding description is mainly taken, 
remarks concerning this species '-that in general appearance it resem- 
bles greatly G. deppii, from which, however, it is distinguished by the 
following characters: (1) Dorsal scales are not so large, somewhat 
swollen, constituting fourteen and not eleven longitudinal, less con- 
verging series; (2) two loreals, the upper slightly recurved on the 
muzzle; (8) different coloration, especially less brilliant." 

A single specimen from Orizaba in the national collection agrees in 
every respect with the description of Bocourt except in the number of 
dorsal scales. Of these there are twenty-five transverse series and 
seventeen longitudinal. i\s the inferior row is composed of two scales 
to each single scale of a cross-row, perhaps they should not be counted; 
which leaves fifteen longitudinal rows. Tiiere is no superior loreal as in

This handsome species is widely distributed in eastern and central 
Mexico, where it is represented by three well-marked subspecies, which 
may yet come to be regarded as true species. A fourth subspecies is 
found in western Texas, which differs less widely from the typical form. 
The characters of these subspecies are as follows : 

One preocular, two loreals, posterior cauthal descending to labials. Legs separated 
by length of hind leg. Belly immaculate ; tail shorter G. I. ventralis. 

No preoculars, two loreals, posterior canthal descending to labials. Tail moderate; 
extended legs separated by length of forearm ; brown above, with ten cross bands; 
belly black spotted G. I. Uocephalus. 

Two preoculars, three loreals, not separated by the single posterior canthal ; pre- 
nasal in contact with first labial. Tail 2.75 times head aud body; exteuded limbs 
separated by length of humerus; red, with ten light cross bands V-shaped back- 
ward ; belly black spotted 0. I. ojihiurus. 

Three loreals, posterior canthal divided, each half corresponding to a loreal; pre- 
nasal separated from contact with first labial; tail twice head and body. Light 
olive, with seven or eight dark cross-bars; below yellowish marbled with olive. 

G. I. infernalis.

Body rather slender, very small, considerably depressed. Tail twice 
the head and body. Hind leg from knee equal to the head to ear. 
Dorsal scales in sixteen longitudinal and fifty-one oblique series; sixty- 
seven from chin to anus; tail with 127 whorls. Eight central or median 
dorsal rows of scales ob- 
tusely and faintly cari- 
nated (very obsoletely on 
the outer rows); central 
two or three rows on the 
tail similar; all the other 
scales perfectly smooth. 
Xasal plate applied only 
against the second labial 
and separated from the 
rostral. Three supple- 
mentary plates between 
rostral and internasal; 
the frontal hexagonal en- 
circled by six plates. 
Four postnasal, the up 
per posterior very large 
and superior. Four lore- 
als instead of one. 

Above light olive, with 
seven or eight obscure 
bars of darker, bordered 
before or behind with 
bars of the ground color, 
edged faintly with whit- 
ish. Beneath yellowish, 
marbled coarsely with 
olive. Head plain. Tail nearly uniform reddish olive. 

The single specimen of this subspecies exhibits peculiarities of cephalic 
plates which, if constant, will at once separate it from all other known 
North American Gerrhonoti. The head is depressed, running forward to 
an acute point; pyramidal; the length two-thirds the width, which is 
five-sevenths the length to ear, which in turn is rather more than one- 
fifth (about two-ninths) the head and body. The moutli is unusually 
pointed aud depressed. The dilference in the cephalic plates from those

518 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

of G. multicarinatus appear to be caused by the development of three 
additional plates just back of the rostral, aud the unusual size and more 
superior position of the upper posterior postnasal. The three supple- 
mentary rostral plates are all in contact anteriorly with the rostral; the 
median largest, separating the anterior pair of internasals, and in con- 
tact behind with the two posterior internasals which are in apposition. 
The lateral supplementary plate separates the nasal entirely from con- 
tact with the rostral and the first labial, the nasal being restricted to the 
second labial. The posterior pair of internasals is large; longer than 
broad; bounded externally by the displaced anterior iuteruasal and the 
upper first postnasal. The upper second postnasal is very large and on 
the canthus rostralis; almost entirely on the upper surface of the head. 
The frontal is hexagonal and encircled by six plates, in front by the pos- 
terior internasals, laterally by the upper posterior postnasal (as large as 
the lower), and behind by the j)Ostfrontals; of these the latter are 
rather largest, the others nearly equal. The usually single loreal is 
replaced by four small plates, the anterior upper largest; the posterior 
upper smallest; the two lower square, equals and forming a kind of bor- 
der to the upper labials. There are nine labials to the i)osterior infra- 
orbital, instead of eight. The supraorbital plates are five and three. 

The general color above is a dull, light greenish or true olive, with 
about seven obscure bands across the back and sides between head 
and tail, covering a width of some two scales. On the sides some of 
the scales adjacent to these dusky bars (not always the posterior ones) 
are edged with dull clayey whitish. The tail is scarcely varied anteri- 
orly, only there are some traces of the whitish edges. The under parts 
are light yellowish, obscurely marbled with the ground color of the 
back. The head is entirely uniform olive, exce])t below. 

The lateral blotches are somewhat peculiarly constituted. The pat- 
tern is as if there were one vertical row of scales of a plain dark brown, 
and another behind this of the lighter ground color edged with whitish, 
the two then broken midway and the lower half transposed, so that on 
one row the lower scales are whitish, the upper brown; while in that 
posterior to it the lower are brown, the upper whitish; the succession 
below being thus white and brown, and above brown and white. The 
perfectly plain intervals cover about four rows. 

This lizard occurs throughout the first plateau country of Texas from 
the Kio Grande to the Red River. It has been found on the Helotes 
Creek by Mr. Marnock, aud in Wichita County by Mr. Boll. I did not 
see it living; it is rather rare, and is said to inhabit rocky places. 
There is no evidence of its occurrence outside of Texas in the United 
States. It is not known to occur within the proper limits of the 
Sonoran subregion, but is common in the Tampican subregion of the 
Centra] American region of the neotropical realm. It must be regarded 
as an invader from that realm, but it ranges much farther north than 
any of the other forms of that launa.

Body sleuder, very small, much depressed. Tail two and one-fifth 
times the head and body. Dorsal scales in fourteen longitudinal and 
fifty-eight oblique series; sixty-two from chin to anus. Tail with 131 
whorls. Scales all entirely 
smooth, or the middle dor- 
sal rows with a very blunt 
obsolete carination. Frontal 
plate rhomboidal ; large, sep- 
arating the internasals from 
the ]>ostfrontals. Two pairs 
of internasals and two of 
postnasals. Supraorbitals 
in scales of 5 and 3. lliiid 
leg from knee equal to dis- 
tance from snout to ear, 
which is one- fifth the head

Ground color light yellow-

broad bars (three scales 
wide) edged behind with 
black, having a wliitish mar- 
gin posteriorly. Tail with 
thirty half rings of the 
same, changing behind into 

blotches. Sides with narrow black bars, on a light ground, 
greenish white, each scale si)Otted with blackish. 

The frontal plate of this species is smaller than in many others of 
the section, although it separates the posterior internasals from the 
postfrontals, the gap between them filled u[) by the upper i)osterior 
postnasal. It is (piite probable, however, that occasionally the pos- 
terior internasals and the postfrontals may come into actual contact, as 
the former are considerably longer than in G. nudficarinatus. I do not 
perceive any other special peculiarities in the cephalic plates. The

head is poiuted and depressed; the height scarcely two-thirds the 
width, which is rather more than two-thirds the head to the ear. The 
tibial joint is very short; all the limbs unusually feeble; the fore legs 
extended forward do not reach to the eye, while in G. muUicarinatus it 
reaches to the nostrils. 

The upper parts are of a light yellowish olive; the back with about 
ten transverse broad bars covering two or three rows of scales; the 
tail with about twenty-nine or thirty of the same. These are of a darker, 
more reddish olive than the ground color, suffused with brownish black 
behind, less conspicuously in front and the interval spotted with dark 
brown. They are margined posteriorly (on the edges of scales) with 
clayey white. Several of those along the middle of the back are 
broken above and the branches displaced or alternating. On the sides 
the posterior black border of the dorsal bars with their whitish edging 
is continued down to the fold on a single scale. There is almost nothing 
of this, however, on the side of the tail, except a slight shade of the 
lighter portion. The sides of the same are marked alternately with seven 
or eight olive and white spots, the former edged before and behind with 
black. The plates of the head above are blotched with dark brown. 
There is no trace of a dusky wash along the sides. The under parts 
are olivaceons white, each scale, except along the middle of chin and 
throat, with a black spot. 

Dr. Boulenger identifies this species with the G. {Elgaria) JdngiiGYAy

species' as having six or eight median dorsal series of scales, keeled, 
which is not the case with the G. nohilis.

Two pairs of internasals and two of postnasals, the hinder pair 
sometimes fused into one. Frontal separatin^f widely tlie postfroutals 
and internasals. Sni)raorbitals in two series of live and three. Head 
very broad and swollen behind, where tbe width is more than two-thirds 
length to ear. Hind feet from knee equal or a little greater than this 
distance. Tail two and one fourth to two and one-half times the head 
and body (iu Cat. No. 3102a). 

Dorsal scales in fourteen transverse and forty-seven to fifty longitu- 
dinal series. Scales all i)rominently carinated, the carina' equidistautj 
scales on anterior as well as upper face of limbs showing more or less 
carination, as also the sides of the tail. 

Color above yellowish brown or gray, with a series of ten to fourteen 
blackish rings, continued quite distinctly across the back, and spotted 
bcliind with white even in the median region. 

This is a variable species, so much so as to have given rise to a 
number of synonyms. It was first described from a young specimen 
by Wiegnumn as G. cwndeus, a name wliich is absolutely erroneous as 
applied to the species in general. Another young individual gave rise 
to the synonym G. webJni Baird. 

In this species the body is cylindrical or subquadrate, rather 
depressed J the belly flattened. There is a decided constriction at 
the neck; the head as wide as the body, a little broader than high; 
the width two-thirds the distance from muzzle to ear, which again is 
two ninths the head and body. The tail is excessively lengthened, two 
and one-third times the head and body, though frequently much shorter 
owing to the breaking off and reproduction in a stump of the tail. This 
is shaped like the body, thcmgh less depressed ; and without the soft 
skin of the sides, though with a shallow groove. The feet are short 
and feeble. 

On each side the body is a fold or strip of soft skin paved at inter- 
vals with small oval scales, with still smaller ones between them, 
especially on the sides. This begins at tbe ear and extends backward 
to the root of the tail, the legs being implanted in it. On the sides it

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 





is about one-fifth tbe width of the belly sheet and is generally con- 
cealed by the folding of the latter over the sides of the dorsal. The 
two lateral strips of soft skin separate a dorsal and ventral sheet or 
plate which are very stifl" and firm, the former rather broader than tbe 
latter. The scales on the sheets are arranged in transverse series, the 
dorsal, however, with a slightly backward direction on the median line. 
The scales on the tail are regularly whorled. 

The ])lates on the head are large and regular. There is a long nar- 
row vertical, concave on each side, wider behind (where it is truncated 

and three sided) than before, 
where it is two sided and obtuse 
angled. There are two jjost- 
frontals, a frontal, and two pairs 
of short, broad internasal j^lates 
to the rostral. The frontal is 
broad, rhomboidal, truncate lat- 
erally, and separates evenly the 
postfrontals and intern asals. 
There is a large inner supra- 
orbital series of five plates, with 
a smaller of three in its external 
concavity. It is bordered exter- 
nally on the upper edge of the 
head by six plates. The nos- 
trils are lateral in a single plate 
next to the first and second 
labials, with two small plates 
behind it, succeeded by a third 
postnasal, in most specimens 
divided into two; next comes a 
large loreal and a smaller ante- 
orbital to the eye. There are 
ten upper labials and nine or 
ten lower. The infraorbitals are 
two; the postorbitals in two 
successive series of three and 
four small plates; then comes four vertical series to the ear. There 
are three median occipital plates in line with the vertical (sometimes 
only two), anterior largest, and three plates on either side larger than 
the rest. The distinction between plates of head and neck is, how- 
ever, very slightly marked. Above it may be known by the transition 
from the single occipital plate to the double dorsal series. There is a 
very slight tendency only to imbrication in the cephalic plate. 

The scales in the dorsal sheet are all conspicuously carinated, the 
upper ones very obtusely mucronate. There are fourteen ridges and 
rows of scales on the dorsal plate, all the scales quite equal in size,

CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 523 

about forty-eight from occiput to above anus. There is no median dor- 
sal ridge or row of scales, the scales forming an even number. There 
are about one hundred and thirty-six series of whorls or scales on the 
tail, all carinated except on the under surface. On the belly sheet are 
twelve series of scales, which are about as wide, but rather shorter 
than the dorsal, and consequently the whorls not continuous all around 
the body as they are on the tail. There are about sixty-three series 
of scales from the chin to the anus, about nineteen or twenty of them 
belonging to chin and throat. The lower labials are margined inter- 
nally by a series of wider plates, and these again by a series three 
times their width. 

The legs are weak and covered with overlapping scales, those on the 
inner surlace smaller. The posterior surface of the thighs and humerus 
is like that of the lateral fold. The scales on the upper and anterior 
surface of the legs are carinate; those in the soles are smooth and 
tubercular. The digits on each foot are all unequal except the third 
and fourth, which are nearly equal and longest. The hind leg is but 
little longer than the fore; the forefoot about two-thirds the hinder. 

The scales are all hard and bony plates, very firm and distinct, covered 
by a thin epidermis. 

The cephalic plates are quite smooth in the young. With age they 
become wrinkled longitudinally, and the posterior extremities more 
angular, elongated, and imbricate. The upper parts are barred with a 
succession of reddish, black, and pale yellowish rings in such a manner 
as to render it difBcult to say what is the ground color. There are 
about twelve narrow black rings on a single whorl from head to tail 
(and thirty-six or more on the tail). Each is bordered behind by grayish 
or yellowish white, usually on the edges of the same scale. These rings 
of black and white, though usually only the width of a single whorl, 
are not entirely regular, passing sometimes from one whorl to another. 
Anterior to the black the color is sometimes quite deep red, some- 
times light brown, passing gradually forward to the next ring into 
light olive gray. The under parts are light greenish olive, the edge of 
the scales paler. 

The red of the dorsal intervals usually fades in a whorl to a shade 
of brownish olive. The light edging to the black often tinges the base 
of the scales behind it and has much the character of specks of thick 
white-lead paint. 

The supposed differences between this species and JiJ. scincicauda dis- 
appear on comparison of a large series of specimens. Some from Mon- 
terey, California, agree with the types in the very thick head, but the 
coloration being perhaps more like that of the types of the supposed 
G. scincicauda. 

The common Gerrhonotus of northern California is very closely 
related to that found at San Diego, and although a comparison of a 
large series conveys a general impression of difference, they are not capa- 



524 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



ble of exact and intelligible definition. The northern form, on the whole, 
is smaller, with a shorter tail, and decidedly more slender head and 
bod3\ The scales are snraller, as shown by an average of 51 in a series 
instead of 47. They are less prominently carinated, especially on the 
arms and legs. 

The color appears to differ in the more indistinct dorsal bands, which 
are usnally more or less effaced along the back, where they also lack 
the distinct white specks bordering the black behind. 

The form called G. grandis is distinguished from the types of G. multi- 
carinatus by its greater smoothness, the absence of white spots on the 
back, and the more uniform oliv^e-brown color. 

It is smoother than the types of G. scineicauda, the hind legs a little 
longer, the scales smaller, the frontal shorter, the tail apparently 
longer. The coloration is very different, being of a uniform clear brown 
olive, with dusky bars shading gradually into paler below, and sharply 
spotted on the sides with white. It is not, however, distinguishable, in 
my opinion, from the typical forms either as species or subsjiecies. 

A specimen from Fort Tejon (Oat. No. 4129) differs quite decidedly 
from the types in having the head and body narrower and more elon- 
gated; the head to ear is not one fifth the head and body. The width 
of the head is not t<vo-thirds the distance from snout to ear, which is 
one fifth the head and body. There are 52 scales in a line from occiput 
to above anus, and 03 from chin to anus. The ridges of the scales on 
the sides are quite obsolete; those on the legs perfectly smooth, exce[»t 
a few faint indications on the upper edge. The legs are very feeble, 
the distance from the knee to the end of toes being equal to that from 
snout to ear; from elbow to end of claw is four-fifths this distance. 
There are about thirteen bands from head to anus. The bands on the 
back are more distinct and a good deal spotted behind with white. 

The geographical range of the Gcrrhonotus multwannatus is the 
Pacific district from Pnget Sound to San Diego, Calilbrnia, and as far as 
the southern extremity of the Lower Californian peninsula. According 
to Mr. T. S. Palmer, the present form is confined to the chaparral belt. 
Stejneger is of the opinion that the Cape St. Lucas form is specifically 
distinct from the Californian, but I have not been able to substantiate 
the difference. He uses for the latter the name G. scineicauda Skilton.

GERRHONOTUS MULTICARINATUS PALMERII Stejneger. 

(ierrhonotus mnlticaiinatiis jjalmerii SxE.iNKtiKU, North American Fauna, No. 7, 
Pt. 2, 1893, p. 196. 

Dr, Stejueger describes this species as follows: 

Similar to G. scincicauda, but body much les.s elongated and coloration above 
essentially difterent, being, according to ago and sex, either uniform dark olive 
brown with numerous black and white dots on the sides, or pale bluish drab clouded 
with numerous ill-defined and irregular blotches of brownish drab, blot<hes not 
arranged in cross bands. 



526 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



The geueral aspect of this form i.s strikingly (lift'eieut from all the other Califor- 
uian Cerrhonoti, and this difference is equally well marked in tbe youngest specimen 
and in the oldest. I have l)efore me a nearly unbroken series of ten specimens, from 
a very young one, with a body only 40""" long, up to the dark old males, and none 
of them can for an instant be mistaken for the typical G. scincicauda from the lower 
valleys. The whole figure is shorter and more thick set, and the broad and rather 
distant cross bands on the back are conspicuously abrupt, the coloration being 
either uniform dark or else an ill-defined, often obscure, 'pepper-and-salt' mixture. 
Only in one specimen (No. 18612) is there a more definite arrangement of the light 
and dark spots, but these ill-defined cross bands are much more numerous than in 
G. scincicauda, being about fifteen on the back (between anterior and posterior 
limbs) as against nine to teu in the latter. A similar pattern may also be traced in 
the youngest specimen referred to (No. 18613), with a similar result. 

Most of the Gerrkonoti brought home by the Death Valley expedition belong to 
this form, of which there is no specimen in the Museum collection from any definite 
and undoubted locality before, and all the specimens of the exi)editiou were col- 
lected in a comparatively small area near the headwaters of the Kern, Kings, and 
Kaweah rivers, at an altitude of from about 7,000 to 9,000 feet above the sea. 

It might seem strange that there should be no name available among the many 
defunct synonyms of Californian Gerrkonoti by which to distinguish this form, but 
the fact seems to be that most of the specimens so far brought to the notice of 
herpetologists have been collected in the lower altitudes, while the present form 
seems to be restricted to the higher altitudes of the Sierra. 

Habitat. — High elevations of western slope of southern [only?] Siena 
Nevada.

from snout to ear, which is one-fifth the head and body. There are 
forty-seven scales from head to above anus; rather more slightly cari- 
nated on the sides than above. There are fourteen dorsal rows of

scales, but a fifteenth is seen at intervals along the doi-sal line, and 
there should really be a sixteenth. The cheek scales are smooth, those 
on the upper edge of the legs taintly carinated. The surface of the 
head is slightly arched or convex; the plates not very smooth. The 
four internasals are large, in two rows, which are as long as broad. 
The frontal is very small, rhomboidal; completely embraced between 
the postfrontals behind and the posterior row of internasals before, 
which are in contact, a very peculiar feature. There are but two 
postnasals and a large loreal. The hinder feet from knee are equal 
to distance from snout to ear; the forefeet from elbow are a little 
less. 

The ground color is a light greenish gray or ash, with a series of 
about twelve vertical black bars, spotted with white, on each side, 
the bar the width of a single scale, but sometimes passing from one to 
another. A dorsal span of about six scales in width is without bars, 
but with a series of thirteen or fourteen subquadrate dark blotches, not

quite teu scales wide and one long. The legs are faintly blotched; the 
head very slightly. 

The peculiarities of this species are its very small interfrontonasals, 
two postnasals only, the indication of a fifteenth dorsal row of scales, 
the greenish-ash color, without transverse dorsal bands, and with the 
blackish instead of white dorsal series. 

In the type specimen (Cat. No. 4132) there are forty-eight rows of 
scales on sixteen transverse series. The interparietal is very small 
and elongate rhomboidal. The frontal is rather larger, but its general 
characters the same. 

A series of teu specimens from Fort Point, near Sau Francisco, difler. 
slightly, though probably the same as E. formosa. They are rougher 
and more sharply carinated on the back. The head is nearly as deep 
as broad; the width, however, scarcely two thirds the length (thus nar- 
rower). The legs are short; the anterior from the elbow about three- 
fourths the distance from snout to ear, or decidedly less than in the 
type; the hinder from knee about equal to this distance. The snout 
to ear is about two-ninths in the head and body, or a little longer in 
proportion. 

The interparietal is narrow, lozenge shaped. The interfrontouasal, 
thongh large, is embraced between or encircled by the two postliontals 
and the two post-iuternasals, which are long. Anterior to the frontal 
is a smaller median plate in contact with it and the rostral, and sepa- 
rating the anterior internasals; this, however, is probably not regular. 
If constant it will establish the species. There are two small post- 
nasals and three large outer supraorbitals, besides the five on the 
external edge, as in the type. 

There are sixteen dorsal series of scales, all about of equal width, and 
the scales in the upper edge of the soft fold just below this are decidedly 
larger than those of the others. The dorsal ridges are all very distinct 
and well defined, most conspicuous on the back, where they almost 
form a mucro. The scales on the upper part of the cheeks and those 
on the back and sides of neck are distinctly carinated, as are those ou 
the upper edge of the limbs and on the tail, except on the lower surface. 

There are about fifty-one scales from occiput to tail and sixty-two 
from chin to anus. This is an appreciably greater number than in the 
type, and is worthy of consideration. 

The ground colors in this are of an olivaceous reddish gray. There 
is a dorsal stripe of six and two half scales wide, lighter than the ground 
color, becoming still lighter, turning almost into a white stripe exter- 
nally. On each side below this light space are about fourteen approx- 
imately vertical but rather broken black bars, sharply margined behind 
with white, each a single scale in width. On the back, and connecting 
these lateral bars, is a series of fifteen transverse dusky ones, slightly 
concave anteriorly, but rather irregular. The suborbitals are black, 
edged below with white; the labials are black and white. The under 
parts are greenish white. There is no white whatever on the back.

This variety is readily distinguishable from E.principis by the much 
rougher scales, aud the equality of the lower lateral scales to those 
above them, as well as by its more compressed body, two postnasals, 
and the white edges to the lateral scales. It is very similar to the 
type specimens of E.forniosa, having the sixteen rows of scales above 
and the two postnasals. The chief difference is in a greater number 
ot scales in a dorsal series (51), narrower head and shorter fore legs, and 
the ground color brownish olive instead of greenish ash, with a series 
of fifteen transverse dorsal bars instead of thirteen or fourteen spots. 

In his report of the Deatlr Valley expedition, Dr. Stejneger states 
that — 

This form is only distantly related to G. mtdticarinatus, but very closely to (i. prin- 
ciph, so close, in fact, that I believe that the name of the latter will become reduced 
to a trinomiual when the geographical distribution of the two forms shall have been 
ascertained in all its details. G, burnettii is now known to occur along the coast at 
least from Monterey to Humboldt Bay. How far inland it extends its range, and 
how and where it meets or grades into G. principis is as yet undeterminable. One 
thing is certain, however, and that is, that the range of G. burnettii and G. muUicari- 
natus overlap considerably, and in this fact alone I see suflScient proof of their spe- 
cific distinctness. The differences between them are certainly due neither to sexual, 
nor to seasonal, nor to individual variation, great as the latter is in the Gerrhonoti.

Body niucli depressed and uimsually smooth. Head much depressed, 
the depth about three-fourths the width, or less, the width more than 
two thirds the distance from su out to ear; occipital lo/.enge-shaped; 
vertical lengthened; frontal small, completely embraced by the post- 
frontals and post-internasals in contact and of about equal size. Two 
l)airs of postnasals. Inner large supraorbitals usually four, embracing 
two in their concavity, not three. Fore legs from elbow rather less, 
hinder from knee rather more, than the distance from snout to ear, 
which is from one fourth to one-fifth the head and body. The tail is 
not quite twice the latter distance. There are sixteen longitudinal rows 
of dorsal scales, the lowest about half that adjacent to it. There are 
about 48 scales from head to tail above, 55 from chin to anus. The 
scales are everywhere remarkably smooth ; the carination quite inap- 
preciable on the back, though 
each scale is slightly and obso- 
letely keeled. On the sides 
this does not extend to the 
posterior edge, and it is want- 
ing on the lowest row. All the 
plates of the head and neck, 
as well as of the limbs, are 
smooth or with an inappreci- 
able trace of carination. 

This species is distinguished 
from G. burnettii likewise, by 
having sixteen rows of scales 
above, by the possession of 
four postnasals (although some- 
times the two upper are fused 
intoonelongone,leavingthree) 
instead of two. This length- 
ens the muzzle, which is more 
depressed. There are only two 
outer supraorbitals instead of three. The lower row of lateral scales 
is only half as large as the next instead of nearly equal to it. The 
carination is much more obsolete, being entirely wanting in the back of 
the neck, and in some other regions distinctly keeled in G. burnettii. 
The body is much more depressed. 

This species is of a light reddish, olive brown, the sides for about 
four or five rows of scales blotched with dusky, nearly black above, 
and not constituting distinct regular vertical bars; the remnant of a 
continuous lateral stripe from the snout, and least effaced above. 
The back has an irregular median series of rounded dusky blotches, 
sprinkled more distantly elsewhere. There are traces of sixteen or 
eighteen of the lateral and dorsal dark blotches. The under parts are 
yellowish white, with a tinge of greenish. The edges of the cephalic

Head shields swollen. Ear aperture bordered in front by two or three 
small scales and behind with granular ones. Nasal sei^arated from the 
rostral. Four prefrontouasal and two internasals. A single nasoloreal. 
No loreal. Dorsal scales imbricated and strongly keeled, a little larger 
than the ventral plates. Lateral fold strong. Tail medium length. 
Body with or without brown transverse bands in the male: two narrow 
longitudinal yellow lines on the back of the female. 

Head-plates separated by strong grooves, causing inequality of the 
surface. Length from end of muzzle to middle of ear equal to ten trans- 
verse series of dorsal scales, and entering four and one-half times into 
the space between the chin and anus. The muzzle supports two inter- 
nasals, relatively well developed, situated to the right and left above 
the nasal, and two large prefrontonasals, which are convex and longer 
than wide, and truncate posteriorly. These plates are followed by two 
l)retVontals which are angulate posteriorly, and which form a longi- 
tudinal furrow, where they meet, along the median line on top of the 
muzzle. Frontal flat and with the posterior angle truncated ; the inter- 
parietal also flat, and with the frontal depressed so that the surround-

ing scales are prominent. The occipital scute is in contact with seven 
obtusely keeled scales; in front with the parietal and the two inter- 
parietals, on each side with an accessory occipital, and behind with two 
roof-shaped nuchal scales. Each of the subocular regions contains 
seven plates of uneciual dimensions, with four sui)erci]iary plates on the 
exterior border. Nostril pierced in the medioposterior i)art of the nasal 
plate, which is in contact in front with the interuasal, and above with 
the superior postnasal; posteriorly Avith the inferior postnasal, and 
below with the two first supralabials. A large loreal scute which is 
wider above than below, and articulates in front with the postnasals, 
above with one of the prefroutonasals, with a prefrontal and with a 
supraocular; behind with the preocular, and on the basal side, which is 
narrow, with a part of the fourth supralabial. The preocular, much 
smaller than the loreal, is irregularly quadrilateral; is followed by two 
or three subocular scutes, the last one of which is generall}' very long. 
Ten supralabials; the first seven subquadrilateral, the two following 
pentagonal, and the last one, well developed as to length, terminates 
in a point. Cheek scales angular and flat. Ear-aperture triangular, 
bordered in front with two or three small convex scales, and behind 
with scaly grains. The postgenial scute is sometimes simple, but more 
frequently it is divided and followed by four pairs of large submaxillary 
plates; the first pair of these only are in contact on their inner sides; 
tbe other are separated on their external borders from the inferior 
labials by a row of scales. Lateral fold strong, having scaly grains 
similar to those on the sides of the neck; it begins beneath the ear and 
ends at the side of the cloaca. 

Dorsal scales large and subrhomboidal ; they form twelve to fourteen 
longitudinal series, and thirty-five to thirty-seven transverse ones from 
tbe auditory aperture to the posterior border of the thighs; in the dor- 
sal region they are strongly keeled, and more or less prolonged to a 
point, and the keels united form six prominent lines. On the flanks 
these scales are smooth or slightly rounded ; the first transverse series 
on the neck is composed of eight scales roughly keeled. The ventral 
plates are shorter, forming twelve longitudinal rows. Tail rounded 
quadrangular at base, rounded the rest of its length, very tapering at 
the end, and much longer than the head and trunk combined; it is 
encircled, when complete, by one hundred whorls of keeled scales, the 
keels forming prominent lines. Anus bordered with four scutella. 
Scales of the upper part of the anterior limbs larger than those on the 
underside; the reverse is found on the posterior limbs; toes covered 
above and below with well-developed scutella: claws short and hooked. 
Total length of a type specimen with perfect tail, according to Deppe, 
177 mm.; from chin to anus, 87 mm.; tail, 90 mm. 

Measurements. — Total length, 3;i0 mm.; length of head from end of 
muzzle to the middle of oar, 2G mm.; width of head at the borders of 
the temples, 18 mm.; length of body from chin to anus, 120 mm.;

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



length of tail, 210 mm.; length of arm to the end of the middle fiuyer, 
29 mm.; length of leg to the end of the longest toe, 35 mm. 

The two type specimens sent to M. Bocourt by Professor Peters are 
olivaceous above and greenish gray on the sides; they present no trace 
of transverse or longitudinal bands. Head dotted with j'ellowish white 
points, which cut the posterior or lateral edges of the scales. This light 
color is also seen on the lips and on the subocular region. Lower sur 
faces pale yellow, shaded to a greenish tint on the throat and on the 
sides of the belly. 

Professor Duges ' gives the following color variations of this species: 

The typical coloration is brown above and yellow below, with the skhi of the lat- 
eral fold jiale greenish. Varying from this type, the lateral region above the fold 
becomes striped with brown-green or drab, a lighter band above a darker one. The 
color of the fold may be cross-banded with darker, and the dorsal region marked 
with transverse or rounded brown spots on a greenish on yellowish ground. Or the 
dorsal region may be uniform brown with pale blue spots, each with a dark blue 
center, and the fold band bo blue spotted. The last pattern indicates the var. lichen- 
igerus (G. lichenigei-us Wiegmann). According to Dugfes there may be either one or 
two loreals. 

Duges says that this species is less vivacious and irascible than the 
G. Uocephalus, but that when it bites, it does so with much force. It is 
readily domesticated; then comes to take its food from the fingers. It 
eats all kinds of living insects, and swallows them by movements of the 
throat muscles like those made by snakes. " I have seen it," he says, 
" eat full-grown Scelopori of the species 8. scalaris and S. grammicus, 
occupying about ten minutes in the operation. The country people 
believe them to be poisonous, an opinion which it is unnecessary to 
contradict; but I know from repeated experiences that when they bite 
they draw blood, and they do not easily let go." 

Duges further remarks that in the valley of Mexico the Barissia 
imbricata is found about the acequias, but in the State of Guanajuato 
it only occurs in the mountains, where the winter is tolerably severe. 
It is also found in the Orizaban district, as Mr. W. S. Blatchley^ states 
that he found it at an elevation of 11,000 feet on Mount Orizaba, and 
I have three specimens from Lacuatipan, Hidalgo from Dr. Santiago 
Bernard. According to Duges it is also found in Michoacan.

Ihtrrisfiia levkoUis SriciNKciEK, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XIII, 18110, p. 184. 

The following is Dr. Stejneger's descrii^tiou of this sijecies: 

No azygos prefrout;il; three pairs of shields between the frontal and the rostral; 
prefrontals not in contact with loreal; no projecting scales above the ear; one large 
upper postorbital and two minute lower ones ; forty-six transverse vows of dorsal 
scales between the head and the base of the tail, and sixteen longitudinal rows ; head 
shields swollen. Head narrow, snout long, pointed ; head shields swollen ; two pairs 
of internasals, the posterior in contact with anterior supraocular; one pair of pre- 
frontals; nasal separated from rostral; a supranasal; a postnasal; a loreal, pentago- 
nal, not higher than wide, and separated from prefrontals ; a preorbital ; two 
suborl)ital8, the posterior very long ; one very large upper postorbital and two minute 
lower ones; ten and twelve supralabials; sides of neck covered with granular 
scales; lateral fold, commencing below the ear opening; nuchal scales not keeled, 
in ten longitudinal rows; dorsal scales of medium size, in sixteen longitudinal rows,

the four median obtusely keeled, the next two on each side with the keels still less 
pr;mounced and the remainder smooth; forty-six transverse dorsal rows; ventrals 
smaller than dorsals, in twelve longitudinal rows; [tail reproduced]. 

Color (in alcohol) above uniform " tawny-olive" with interrupted transverse bands 
of black dots on tlie sides, the scales with the dots being margined posteriorly, more 
or less distinctly, with whitish ; under side dull pale clay-color, with irregular black 
dots on flanks and throat. 

Measurements. — From snout to vent, 121 mm.; from snout to ear 
opening, 27 mm.; from snout to fore limb, 38 mm.; from axilla to groin, 
67 mm. ; greatest width of head, 18 mm. ; fore limb, 27 mm. ; hind limb, 
■^4 mm. 

Unfortunately, the exact locality where the type of this species was 
collected is not known; all that the record book contains is "Mexican 
Boundary." It was evidently obtained by one of the surveying parties 
of the United States and Mexican Boundary, but the original number

haviug- become obliterated, it was reentered in 1877 aud the original 
label— or what remained of it — destroyed. 

The present species belongs to the same group as the foregoing, hav- 
iug "three pairs of shields between the frontal and the rostral," or in 
other words, "two pairs of internasal scuta." It differs from B. imhri- 
cata, however, in the greater number of dorsal rows, both longitudinal 
and transverse; in the obsolete carination of the dorsal scales; in the 
exclusion of the loreal from the prefrontals; in the smaller size and 
greater number of the temporals, and in the narrower and more elon- 
gated shape of the head. It has the sixteen longitudinal rows of 
dorsals in common with B.planifrons Bocourt, but the head shields are 
swollen aud the other characters which separate it from B. imhricata 
also distinguish it from B. -planifrons. B. rudicoUis is still farther 
removed by the low number of the transverse dorsal rows, the strong 
carination of the nuchal shields, and the contact of the nasal with the 
rostral. 

A Barissia olivacea was described by Baird in 1858^ as North Ameri- 
can, but Stejneger shows that the locality is uncertain, and that it is 
the B. imhricata Wiegmann of Mexico.

Dorsal scales very obtusely keeled or smooth ; lateral scales smooth. 
Lateral fold conspicuous. Nasal separated from the rostral. Frontal 
preceded by two plates, as is the case in most of the species. Six inter- 
nasorostrals. No supranasals or loreals. Genial entire. Loreal ocular 
in contact with the sublabials. Tympanum encircled by small convex 
scales. Tail of medium length. Upper surface of body a greenish 
brown. Sides numerously streaked with black. Lower surfaces dark 
green sjjotted with yellow. 

Head relatively short, wide behind, arched above, and covered with 
smooth scales ; length from the end of the muzzle to the ear, equal to 
twelve or thirteen transverse series of dorsal scales and enteriag four 
and one-half times into the space between the chin and arms. Supra- 
nasals small, separated in my specimen by a small azygous plate, which 
is not present in Bocourt's specimens. There are two pairs of prefronto- 
nasals on the top of the muzzle; the first pair are small, aud in the 
specimen sent to M. Bocourt by Professor Peters, these two scales are 
abnormally spaced from each other, and from their position could easily

be mistaken for the suprauasals, which are still smaller. Those of the 
third pair are more developed, are almost of the dimeusions of the 
prefrontals in Bocourt's specimen, but smaller in mine. The latter are 
pentagonal and articulate with the anterior angle of the frontal. The 
frontal is larger behind than before, equal in length to the distance from 
its anterior extremity to the end of the muzzle. The interparietal 
large and elongate-hexagonal, in contact with the abbreviated point 
of the preceding scale, and with the two frontoparietals; on each side 
with a parietal, and behind with the occipital, which in turn borders on 
the right and left with a postparietal larger than itself. Next to the 
occipital are two rows of very small nuchal scales smilar to those on 
the neck. Each supraocular region has five or six largo plates, which 
embrace two or three smaller ones externally, which are bordered exte- 
riorly by five superciliary plates. Nostril opening wide, situated in the 
posterior part of the nasal, Avhich is subrectangular; this plate is in 
contact anteriorly with the supranasal scute, and above with that of 
the lirst prefrontonasal; below with the two first supralabials and 
behind with the two superposed nasoloreals; loreal either single or 
double, a larger above a smaller. The loreals are followed by one large 
hexagonal preocular; next come three suboculars, the latter well devel- 
oped as to length. There are ten supralabial plates; the first seven 
are quadrilateral; of these the third, the fourth, and the fifth are the 
highest; the eighth and ninth are pentagonal, and the tenth ends in 
an acute angle; four pairs of inferior labials; the cheek scales are 
smooth, imbricated, and polygonal. The ear aperture is triangular and 
surrounded by granular scutella. Genial undivided and is followed, 
on the right and left, by three large, smooth, submaxillary plates; 
those of the first pair are in contact with each other on the internal 
side, and all are separated on the opposite side from the inferior labials 
by a row of scales. 

Lateral fold beginning under the eye and ending at the side of the 
cloaca; the scales on the side of the neck are granular. The cervical 
and dorsal scales are subrhomboid and of medium size; they constitute 
fourteen longitudinal series and fifteen transverse from the nape of the 
neck to the posterior border of the thighs; those of the vertebral 
region are obtusely keeled or smooth, while those on the sides are 
smooth. Yeutral plates of very nearly the same dimensions, subquad- 
rilateral, with a bowed posterior border, forming twelve longitudinal 
and forty-two transverse rows from the level of the arm to the anus, 
which is bordered by four scutella. Tail with fifty-seven whorls of 
scales, upper caudal scales more strongly keeled than those of the 
dorsals. Limbs short; the anterior ones covered above with flat scales 
and underneath with granular ones. The toes are protected above and 
below by a series of scaly plates; the claws are short and curved.

Upper partof body is bronze green; head spotted with black on top; 
three black longitudinal bands on the back, of which the middle one is 
the widest and extends to the middle of the tail (these bands may be 
represented by series of brown spots); flanks and sides of neck with 
vertical black bars or a black network inclosing greenish-white dots; a 
streak of the same color on each side of the head on a black ground 
color; tbis line begins at the nostril, passes beneath the eye, crosses 
the cheek, and fades out on the side of the neck in the midst of spots 
of the same color, or it may be wanting on the cheek; lower surfaces 
datk green, with numerous small, angular, yellowish-white spots. The 
specimen sent to M. Bocourt by Professor Peters has the breast light 
green, with numerous greenish-black spots, some of Avhich are as large 
as those on the belly and tail. 

Concerning this species, M. Bocourt remarks: " 6r. antauges closely 
resembles G. (Mesaspis) moreletii in the shape of the head and the color- 
ation of the upper surfaces. It differs from the two other sj^ecies here 
described, in the presence of an anterior dorsal plate, agreeing in this 
respect with the (/. Jimhriata."

Xenosauridm Boui.enger, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. (5), XIV, 1884; Cat. Liz. Brit. 
Mus., 2d ed., II, 1885, p. 250. 

Boulenger's description is as follows: 

Tongue short, villose, witli a narrow feebly incised, rebractile anterior part covered 
with flat pipilLi;. Dentition strictly pleurodont; teeth numerous, small, with long 
cylindrical shafts, the laterals with obtusely bi- or tricuspid crowns; the new teeth 
originate between the bases of the old ones. Palate toothless. Postorbital and 
frontosquamosal arches bony ; supratemporal fossa not roofed over by bone ; premax- 
illary, frontal, and parietal single; nasals distinct; palatines and pterygoids widely 
separated medially, both bordering the infraorbital fossa; a supraorbital bone. 
Limbs well developed. Clavicle slender, not dilated proximally; iuterclavicle 
T-shaped; sternum without fontanelle. 

The unique genus, of which the preceding description is given, constitutes a con- 
necting link between the Iguanida' and the Anguida). Its affinity to the former is 
shown by the T-shaped clavicle, the absence of symmetrical bony shields on the

bead, and of osteodoiiiial plates on the bo<ly; to the latter by tlie stiuctuie of the 
tougue, the teetb not hollowed out at the base, and the widely separated palatine* 
bones. 

In Xenosaurus the alimeutary canal presents nothing exceptional. 
There is no distinct colon, and hence no cfficnm. The liver is elongate 
as in other Diploglossa, and the gall bladder is proximad to the margin, 
and is just visible from below. The corpora adiposa do not project 
freely into the body cavity. The kidneys are large. The mesenteries 
are of the normal tyi^e. 

The hemipenis of Xenosaurus is quite peculiar. There are no calyc- 
uli or flounces. There is a prominent fold with pectinate edge on each 
side of the sulcus spermaticus, which incloses a pyriform area. This is 
divided in the middle by a longitudinal fold, which represents the welt 
opposite the sulcus of various other genera, and its distal end terminates 
in a free papilla. From the apex there depend two large divergent 
club-shaped papill;^, which have a series of points along the adjacent 
sides. There is a small papilla at the base between them. The 
arrangement has a remote resemblance to that seen in the Chamcdeon 
'pardalis, and is unlike anything found in the other Diploglossa. 

The following are the characters of the only known genus : 

No abdominal ribs. Head covered with small tubercular scales, which coalesce 
with the skull. Eyelids well developed. Tympanum covered with scales. Body 
depressed, covered above with granular scales intermixed with tubercles, inferiorly 
with cross rows of squarish juxtaposed scales; no bony plates. Digits well devel- 
oped, with sharp, curved claws. No femoral pores. Tail round. . Xenosaurus Peters. 

But one species of this genus is known, the Xenosaurus grandis Gray, 
a rather small Mexican lizard. The genus Exostinus Cope from the 
White Eiver bed of Colorado resembles this one, so far as known, and 
may enter the same family.

Superior plate of petrous bone produced anterior to the anterior semi- 
circular canal. Clavicles proximally dilated, usually perforated. Inter- 
clavicle cruciform (with exceptions in degenerate forms). Frontal bone 
not underarching olfactory lobes. Postorbital and supratemporal 
arches present. Surface of tongue squamous or plicate, not papillose. 
Hemipenis never calyculate. 

In addition to the above definitive characters, the following are gen- 
eral, but with actual or possible exceptions. Surangular and angular 
bones distinct from each other. 

Meckel's cartilage inclosed. Premaxillary not bounded behind by a 
foramen on each side of the inferior plate. 

As regards the visceral anatomy, it may be said that the corpus 



540 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

adiposuui is present and free, except in certain Scincidse, where it is 
wanting. The urinarj^ bladder is present, except in Teiidae, where it 
is wanting. 

A colon is rarely present, and the alimentary canal is not very elon- 
gate. The liver has usually but one or two notches behind, but there 
are modifications to be mentioned under the heads of the respective 
families. It is not elongate, except in serpentiform types. The ventral 
mesentery extends as far as the liver, and sometimes a short distance 
beyond. The transverse or cystic mesentery is present. 

The families differ as follows: 

I. Surangular bone distinct (mostly lacertiform). 

a. One premaxillary bone. 
fj. No urinary bladder. 

Parietal bones coossified; temporal fossa not roofed with bone; no 

osteodermal plates 15. Teiidae. 

/3f3. A urinary bladder. 

Parietal bones distinct; temporal fossse with a bony roof; no osteo- 
dermal plates 16. Xantusiid/E 

Parietals united; temporal fossse overroofed: no osteodermal plates 

17. Lacertid^. 
Parietals united ; temporal fossae roofed ; osteodermal plates. 

18. Gerrhosaurid^. 
aa. Two premaxillary bones. 

Parietals united; temporal fossse roofed ; osteodermal plates. .19. Scincid^. 

II. Surangular bone not distinct (serpeutiform). 

Two premaxillary bones; occipital" segment closely united with parietal; col-* 
umella and arches present; eye distinct 20. Acontiid.e. 

Two premaxillary bones; no columella; no arches; eyes concealed by integu- 
ment 21. DiBAMID.E. 

One premaxillary bone; occipital segment loosely attached; columella present; 
no arches; eye concealed by the integument 22. AnelytropiDjE. 

Of these families the Xantusiidse and Teiidse are confined to the New 
World and the Lacertida? and Gerrhosauridae to the Old World. The 
Scincidae are cosmopolitan, abounding most in the warmer parts of the 
South.

like imbricate papillae on the distal extremity. Dentition strictly pleu. 
rodout. Postorbital and supratemporal arches bony, strong, the supra- 
temporal fossa roofed over by the cranial bones; pra^maxillary single; 
nasals, frontals, and parietals two; palatines in contact with each other 
anteriorly and with the maxillary and ectopterygoid, there being no

infraorbital fossa. Limbs well developed. Clavicle dilated, loop-shaped 
proximally : interclaviele T-shaped. No abdominal ribs. Head covered 
with symmetrical shields, without dermal ossificatious. Body granular 
or tubercular above, plated inferiorly. No movable eyelids. 

The hemipenis is bifurcate in Xantusia, and is shortened, as in many 
Geckonidiie, appropriately to the fragile tail. There is a welt on each 
side of the sulcus spermaticus, which follows a short spiral direction. 
Opposite to the sulcus are two short thick welts, which have the direc- 
tion of parts of consecutive threads of a screw. All of the welts are 
deeply cross folded. 

The position of this family in the system has been discussed by M. 
Bocourt' and myself.- I associated the genera Xantusia Baird, Lepido- 
phi/ma Dumeril, and Cricosaura Peters, and stated that I was not able to 
distinguish them from the family Lacertidce. M. Bocourt places these 
genera in the family " Trachydermi," which also includes Heloderma 
Wiegmann. This family is divided by M. Bocourt into two subfamilies, 
the Glyphodonti for Heloderma^ and the Aglyphodonti for the th.ee 
genera named, together with Xenosaiirus Peters. Previously to this-' I 
had examined and compared the osteology of the Heloderma and XenO- 
saurus. On account of the differences in the form of the mesosternum 
and in some other points, I regard Xenosaurus as the type of a peculiar 
family to be placed with the Helodermidce in the tribe Diploglossa. 
Xantitsia, Lepidophyma, and Cricosaura are, on the other hand, not 
Diploglossa, but are Leptoglossa. They are allied to the Lacertidte, 
and especially to the Asiatic Ophiops, which is, like them, without eye- 
lids. The character of the tongue is, like that of the Ecpleopidie, uni- 
formly squamous, and has no resemblance to that of the Diploglossa. 
The characters of the scapular arch are those of tlie Leptoglossa. The 
clavicle is loop-shaped proximally and the mesosternum is cruciform in 
Lepidophyma and Xantusia. I have not been able to examine Crico- 
saura as to these points. In my paper first mentioned I stated that 
these genera have distinct parietal bones. I think that they should, 
on this account, be distinguished from the Lacertidie, where they are 
coossified. 

The genera of Xantusiidiii are the iollowing : 

I. One frontal and one frontonasal plates. 

Superciliary scales, none ; pupil round Lepidophyma Dumeril. 

Superciliaries present ; pupil verti cal Xantusia Baird. 

II. One frontal, two frontonasals. Pupil erect.

Each of these genera includes but one species, excepting Xantusia, 
which embraces two. All belong to the Pacitic and Sonoran districts, 
except Lepidophymai which occurs in the Central American (Mexican). 

In addition to the characters which I have previously given, Mr. 
Boulenger states' that the sternum is without fontanelle. I find the 
hyoid apparatus has characters somewhat similar to those of the 
LacertidiB. The ceratohyals and second ceratobranchials are both 
present and there is a well developed free epibranchial. Its proximal 
end overlaps the distal end of the second ceratobranchial. It passes 
around the extremity of the first ceratobranchial and extends forward. 
In Lepidophyma it has the jjeculiarity, which I have not seen in any 
other lizard, of being inserted on the lateral process of the basioccipital. 
In Xantusia riversiana it terminates before reaching this point. In 
Lepidophyma it displays a concave expansion as it passes the extremity 
of the first ceratobranchial, in which lies the helicoid cartilaginous 
extremity of the latter. In neither genus are the hypohyals prolonged 
with the ceratohyals, as in Anguidse, nor beyond them as in the Teiidie. 

The stapedial disk in Lepidophyma is not sunk in a canal, as in the 
Iguanidse and some other Sauria. The columella is slender, and termi- 
nates in the interstapedial cartilage. This supports an oblique carti- 
laginous rod, one end of which (suprastapedial) is attached to the 
osseous wall above, and the other longer one (epistapedial) is in contact 
by a flat surface of its extremity with the membranum tympani. 

The remarkable characters of the skull in Xantusia are described 
under the head of that genus. Bocourt^ represents a i)robably similar 
structure in Lepidophyma. 

Xantusia and Jjepidophyma agree in their visceral characters. The 
corpus adiposum is small and projects freely into the abdominal cavity. 
The alimentary canal is distinguished into stomach, small intestines, 
and rectum only, the latter elongate. The posterior border of the liver 
has a small middle lobe; right lobe moderately produced. Lungs equal. 
Mesenteries normal. 

The contents of the stomach of a Xantusia riversiana include vege- 
table remains, and fragments of hymenopterous and coleopterous 
insects, showing a mixed diet.

uudivided scale. Three folds on the throat, the anterior connectinj^ 
the ears inferiorly and encircling the head. Pupil vertical ; no eyelids. 
Digits 5-5. 

Teeth pleurodont, tricuspid; about ten uj)i)er maxillary, nine pala- 
tine. Roof of mouth extended backward as far as angle of mouth and 
ending in a W-shaped outline, the central angular notch behind. This 
is due to dermal flaps extending from the palatine bones, which over- 
lap on the middle line. Tongue thick, fleshy, depressed, and oval, 
entirely attached behind and by a central band, the terminal two-fifths 
free, and slightly notched, the base entire. On the basal third of the 
tongue above are two obli(iue series of wrinkles converging anteriorly; 
these soon become finer and closer, the anterior portion being covered 
with short, compact, depressed, scale-like papillae 

Osteologi/. — iMy knowledge of the osteology of this genns is derived 
from the X. rivers i((n<(, specimens of which I owe to my friend, Br. J. J. 
Rivers, of Oakland, California. 

The premaxillary has an elongate spine above and a nearly trans- 
verse posterior border below. Nasals well developed, distinct. Frontal 
single, grooved below. Parietal single, without pineal foramen, pro- 
duced posteriorly so as to overhang the occipital bone and foramen 
magnum, being connected with the former by a median keel, which it 
sends downward. The supraoccipital is siibhorizontal and is not 
articulated in the usual way with the parietal, having only the median 
contact above mentioned. It is coossified with the exoccipitals. The 
prefrontal is small and is not produced far over the orbit. Lachrymal 
absent. Jugal with the superposterior limb expanded. Postfrontal 
and postorbital fused into a triangular bone, which bounds the parietal 
externally, thus, with the supratemporal, roofing over the temporal 
fossa. Supratemporal in contact throughout with tlie j^arietal, except 
where separated by the narrow splint of a paroccipital. Quadrate with 
one, a large external conch. Vomers closely juxtaposed throughout, 
coossified anteriorly, the median portion of the two elements with an 
excavation. Narial orifices nearly closed, except posteriorly, where the 
vomerine process of the palatine overarches them. The latter are in 
contact in front, but soon spread apart. Maxillary processes rather 
shorter than vomerine, depressed below them. Pterygoids narrow 
throughout, not wider than palatines, their posterior part with a groove 
which looks upward and inward. Basi])terygoids overlapping their 
entire internal face. Ectopterygoids wide, reducing the palatine fora- 
men to a mere' slit; with a considerable contact with the palatine, and 
a recurved portion in contact with the extremity of the maxillary; the 
internal extremity depressed. No presphenoid; sphenoid separated by 
suture from basioccipital, whose lateral processes are com])ressed and 
decurved. The postoptic bone seems to be wanting. The petrosal is 
well produced beyond the semicircular canal, and is equally jjroduced 
below the trigeminal foramen, where it Joins a backward directed i)roc- 
ess of the basipterygoid. The groove below it is well delined and looks 



544 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

downward. The epipterygoid rises at the basipterygoid and rests on 
the anterior border of the petrosal and the posterior border of the well- 
marked descending process of the parietal. Fenestra ovalis not sunk 
in the fundus of a fossa. 

The mandible is remarkable in having but three bones. The articular, 
angular, and suraugular are coossified, and the spleuial and dentary. 
The coronoid has little horizontal jiroduction on the outside of the ramus, 
and the angle of the dentary extends considerably posterior to it. The 
Meckelian groove is entirely closed. 

The hyoid apparatus is described under the head of the genus 
XantKsia. 

There is no zygosphen. There are six cervical intercentra besides 
that of the atlas. The cervical ribs begin on the fourth vertebra. 
Four of these ribs are of peculiar form, being expanded and truncate 
at the extremity so as to be somewhat fan-shaped. Neural sj)ines 
rather low on the cervical and caudal regions, and lower on the dorsal 
vertebr*. Caudal vertebrte segmented toward the anterior part, the 
fissure passing through the middle of the diapophyses. Neural spine 
single, oblique, posterior ; chevron bones normal. 

Suprascapula short and wide ; scapula without proscapula. Coracoid 
with one notch; sternum without fontanelle. Interclavicle with mod- 
erate posterior limb. Sternal ribs three; xiphoid rods not juxtaposed, 
supporting two ribs. No abdominal ribs. 

Pubes meeting at about a right angle; pectineal angles near the 
middle, decurved. Pubis with tuber exterior. Ilium without augulus 
cristas; acetabulum entire. 

The teeth have compressed tridentate crowns; those of the premaxil- 
lary bone are not conic, but have also compressed crowns, where traces 
of denticles are sometimes apparent. 

The remarkable features in the osteology of this genus are (1) the 
peculiar relations between the parietal and supraoccipital bones, which 
resemble the structure seen in a sea turtle; (2) the wide ectopterygoid; 
(3) the absence of lachrymal ; (4) the presence of only three mandibular 
elements. The affinities are a mixture of those of the Lacertid:p- and 
Scincidse; the large postfrontal bones; the descending processes of the 
parietals, and the form of the pubes, resembling the corresponding parts 
in the latter family. The expanded cervical ribs resemble those of the 
Geckonid genus Phyllodactylus. The relations of the parietal and 
occipital bones are quite different from those found in the Lacertidai 
and Anguida' {Gerrhonotus, Celestus, Ophisaurus), where the temporal 
fossa' are also roofed over. In these forms the contact is normal, that 
is, by the elevated median portion of the anterior border of the occipital. 

Three species of this genus have come under my observation. They 
may be distinguished by the following characters: 
fSniall; limbs short, barely overlapping where appressed to the sides. Tail short, 

eijiial from vent to angle of month ; one row of supraocular scales; one parietal 

on each side. Color, light brown with dark brown speckles X. vigilla Baird.

The hind leg extended twice forward reaches to the first gular fold, 
and is contained about two and three-fourth times in head and body, 
the head four and one-half times; the hind foot from heel nearly six 
times. The claws are all very small; the digits covered beneath by a 
series of transverse and imbricating plates. 

The color above generally is a dull brownish yellow varied with small 
blackish spots on single tubercles. The young specimens exhibit a yel- 
lowish vermiculation on a brown 
ground distinctly seen on the 
sides of body, neck, and head.

are two more, making four yel- 
low lines on the nape. The cat. no. 19J, u.s.x.m. 
under parts are whitish. 

In this species the head is short and covered above by a small num- 
ber of very large plates. It is bounded behind by a constriction which 
borders the posterior extremity of the large occipital plates, i)asses 
through the ears, i)ast the end of the lower jaw and across the throat, 
thus completely separating the neck from the head. The head is short, 
broad, pyramidal, and quadrangular; the sides nearly vertical; the 
rostrum rather pointed, its upper outline convex. There is a very large 
hexagonal interparietal plate (the largest on the head), behind which 
are two other irregularly pentagonal postparietals side by side, applied 
against the two posterior faces. The oblique lateral borders are in 
contact with an elongated pentagonal plate, and the anterior with two 
adjacent subtriangular parietal plates, the long sides nearly equal. 
These cover the whole supraorbital space, are in contact behind only 
with the interparietal and parietal plates, excepting a very small one, 
po-stero externally. The plate which represents the frontal is rhom- 
boidal, broader than long, the lateral corners truncated and in contact 
with the supraoculars. This, with the frontoparietals, completely

tills the iuterorbital space, bordered externally by six small square 
supraoculars. Next comes a pair of prefrontals shaped like the fronto 
parietals, but only half the size; then a small regularly hexagonal 
frontonasal, tlie two anterior faces of which are in contact with a pair 
of internasals, which connect with the rostral, which is entirely ter- 
minal and not at all visible from above. The superior plates form ;i 
regular succession of plates in pairs and single, four of the former 
and three of the latter, or 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, the anterior median being 
bordered on either side by the postnasal. The rostral plate is low, 
wide, nearly linear, Avith eight labials on either side. The nostrils are 
small, terminal or lateral, and placed over the junction of rostral and 
labial or in the corners of the rostral, labial, internasal, and nasal (in the 
anteroinferior corner of the latter). There is a large pentagonal post 
nasal, higher than broad, articulating above with the frontal and post- 
frontal. The loreal is large and separated from the orbit by two small 
plates, the lower subcircular and over the junction of the third and 
fourth labial. The orbit is completely surrounded by a circle of small 
plates, of which six are superior, six i)osterior and inferior, and three 
or four anterior. There is a large central mental, with seven labials on 
each side. The labials are bordered internally by tive plates, the 
anterior three much broader than the labials, and filling u^) tlie end of 
the lower jaw, except a median plate connecting the second on either 
side. 

The eyes are large, the i)upil elliptical and vertical. A membranous 
circle, with the edges crimped, seems to represent eyelids. This is 
however, apparently not protractile and is wanting above. 

The auricular openings are vertical, elongated, and directed upward 
and backward. It has a border anteriorly of six or eight small 
tubercles, less than those which cover the cheeks anterior to it. 

The back and sides are covered with small, close, bead-like tubercles 
arranged in transverse series. They are rather elongated and alternate- 
in adjacent rows. There are about forty in a series across the back. 
The chin and throat, to the first fold, are similar but more rounded. 
The two throat folds are close together, the plates in their interval 
rounded, but smaller than elsewhere, the space between them covered 
with four series of square plates increasing successively to the hinder 
one, which, however, is not as large as those on the breast. The under 
parts from the hinder fold to the anus are covered with regular square 
plates in ten longitudinal series, raised to twelve by a lateral more 
irregular and rather smaller row on each side. These plates do not 
alternate in successive rows, but form longitudinal series, these 
twenty-eight transverse series from throat to thighs and three on the 
pubis of two each increasing progressively in size until those bordering 
the anus are much larger than on the belly. Tlie tail is encircled by 
about seventy Avhorls of scales which lengthen behind; they are com- 
posed of square plates, the upper more convex from side to side.

The legs are rather short, covered with tubercles like those on the 
back except on the upper surface of the humerus and the anterior oC 
the forearm and thigh and under surfa(!e of tibia, which are co\ered 
with large plates. The femoral pores, nine or ten in number, are not 
conspicuous. The digits are short; the fourth hind toe not much longer 
than the third; its free portion only half the head from snout to oar. 

In his report on the reptiles of the Death Valley expedition, Dr. 
Stejneger remarks: 

Two additioual specimens are now before us, one collected by Dr. Fisher at Hes- 
})eria, on the south side of the Mohave Desert, on January 4, 1891, while Mr. I'alnicr 
secured the other on February 24, in Pahrump Valley, Nevada, thus extending the 
range of the species nearly 200 miles eastward. The type locality, Fort Tejon, is in 
an open canon — the celebrated Canada de las Uvas of the early exploring exi)edi- 
tions — connecting the west end of the Mohave Desert with the San Joaquin Valley. 
The fauna and flora of this canon present a mixture of Mohave Desert and interior 
valley forms. 

In all probability this species is more or less nocturnal in habits, which may 
account for the scarcity of specimens collected. 

Both specimens are somewhat larger than the largest of the types, and, judging 
from the condition of the femoral pores, I take them to be adults. 

There appears to be some slight variation in the shape of the individual liead 
shields and in the shape of the head, the Death Valley expedition specimens having 
it somewhat more elongate; but the differences are not greater tliau between the 
type specimens themselves. 

Mr. J. Van Deuburgh ' states further that — 
X vigilis is the most abundant lizard in the territory it has chosen for its home. It 
seems to be peculiarly dependent upon the presence of tree yuccas. A glance at Dr. 
Merriam's map (N. Amer. Fauna, No. 7, map 5,1893) shows that these weird i>lau(s 
grow in each of the localities from which the species has been recorded, viz: Fort 
Tejon in the Canada do las Uvas, and Hesperia, in California, and in the Pahinmp 
Valley in Nevada. 

Dr. C. II. Gilbert and the writer collected specimens near Mojave, and found a 
portion of a cast skiu at Victor, California, in November, 1893. In September of the 
following year the writer found this species common at Mojave and Hesperia, and 
secured a single specimen near Cabazou on the eastern slope of San Gorgonio Pass, 
California. The first three of these localities are situated in the great Yucca arhores- 
cens belt, which extends along the southwestern edge of the Mojave Desert. The 
last is in a small and apparently isolated grove of smaller tree yuccas, seemingly of 
another species. 

Habits. — These observations were made in the neighborhood of Mojave, California, 
November 4, 1893. About a mile from the station there is a considerable forest of 
Yucca ayhoresccns. The many trees and wind-l)rokeu branches which lie decaying 
on the ground afford a home to numerous colonies of white ants, scorpions, vicious- 
looking black spiders, and several species of beetles. In a deep crack of one of 
these branches a small lizard was discovered, which, when caught, proved to be a 
young Xantunia rujilis. Probably it had not yet learned how to hide from the day, 
for I have never seen another undisturbed individual. 

The key to their home once discovered, the collection of a large series of these 
lizards was merely a matter of physical exertion. Every fourth or fiftli stem that 
was examined gave up its Xanfiisia, and, in one instance, as many as were ])reviou8ly 
known to collections were found under a single tree. 

Most of the lizards wore fouiul between the bark and the ground, but many had

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



hidden iu tlie thick flusters of dead leaves, from which it was very difficult to dis- 
lodge them. Wheu tirst exposed to the light, they were dark colored, and seemed 
dazzled for a inoinent, during which they made no attempt to escape. They were 
not at all sluggish, however, and if not caught immediately, made for the nearest 
cover as fa.«t as their very short legs would permit. This cover was often the col- 
lector, and the little lizards either hid under his shoes or climbed his legs, sometimes 
even reaching his shoulders. They showed no desire to enter the numerous holes iu 
the ground about them, or to escape by burrowiug. Put into a glass bottle they 
became very light colored in a few minutes, but began to turn dark again immedi- 
ately after sundown. Young specimens wc^re numerous, and remained dark longer 
than adults. Many fragments of cast skins were found, but never a whole skin in 
one place. The stomachs of several individuals contained the wings of some small 
dipterous insect, the elytra of a little brown beetle, and some very small white 
bodies which resembled spiders' eggs. 

Several specimens were taken alive to the Leland Stanford Junior University and 
kept for some months in a large glass jar in which some fine sand and pieces of wood 
and bark had been placed. At first they ventured out from their retreat only at 
dusk unless disturbed, but after a few days they seemed to become more restless, 
and, urged perhaps by hunger, showed themselves many times each day. At night, 
when they were always more active, they often climbed to the top of a piece of 
yucca stem placed upright in the middle of their cage. No desire to burrow was 
observed. All declined to show any intei'est in the small beetles aud dies, both 
dead aud living, which were placed iu the jar, and finally became greatly emaciated. 
They were chloroformed in March, 1894. 

A second note dated Mojave, California, September 17-18, 1894, is as 

follows : 

As it was not practicable to learn by actual investigation whether or not A", rigilis 
hid, during the day, among the thick-growing leaves of the living yuccas, the localities 
examined in 1893, still clearly marked by the displaced rubbish, were again searched 
with great care. The fact that very few specimens were now secured in this previ- 
ously worked area, while the species was very common just outside its limits, is evi- 
dence that the speciuiens found on the ground under the dead branches were in their 
true diurnal home, and not mere stragglers from the living yuccas. 

The speciuiens were all caught alive and put into a large glass bottle, but were 
soon killed by the heat, although care was taken to keep them iu the shade as nuxch 
as possible. Count was kept as the lizards were put in the l)ottle, ;ind showed later 
that several more were taken out than were put in. This may have Iteen due to a 
mistake in the record, but was more probably caused by the birth of young after 
capture. The adults were afterwards carefully examined, and three were found to 
contain young, showing that the species is ovoviparous. One of the three contained 
two fetuses; the others have one each. These fetal sjiecimeus are about the size 
of the young found under the dead branches.

XANTUSIA PICTA Cope. 

Xanhtsia picta Cope, American Naturalist, 189;"), pp. SoO, 939. 

As already uoted in the analytical table of species of Xantusia, this 
species is of more slender ])roportions than the two other members of 
the genns; its limbs and tail are mnch longer, so that its habitats are 
probably different from theirs. There are numerous minor differences 
in the squaination, and the head is much flatter than in either of the 
other species, as well as somewhat wider. In its coloration it is remark- 
ably different, being- much more elegant than the others. Its scutal 
characters ally it with the A', vigilis rather than with the A', river siana. 

Head very much flattened and broad behind; body and proximal 
half of the tail flat, distal half of the latter cylindric. The tail tapers 
gradually from the base, and is not swollen as in the other species. It 
is twice the length of the body. Extended hind limb reaching to 
shoulder; extended fore limb reaching anterior border of orbit. The

digits are not very elongate; the flrst finger is shorter than the flfLh, 
and the second toe extends farther distad than the fifth, which extends 
a little beyond the flrst. Claws well protruded from their sheaths. 

The head scuta are a good deal like those of the X. vigilis. The inter- 
nasal is rectangular, and is a little wider than long; the frontonasals are 
longer than wide and have considerable mutual (contact. The frontal 
is wider than long, as is each of the occipitals. External to the pari- 
etals is a series of four or five smaller scuta, of which the lirst two are 
in contact with the supraoculars One nasal, two loreals, the posterior 
larger than the anterior, and two small preoculars. Eye resting 
directly on superior labials. There are six of the latter on each side, 
and a seventh scale is separated from the mouth border by smaller 
scales. The fifth ami sixth bound the orbit. In the X. vigilis there 
are seven and eight scales on the mouth border; the fifth is immediately 
below the eye, from which it is separated by a series of minute scales. 
A large symphyseal, and only four- inferior labials in contact with the 
lip border: a fifth separated from it by scales. The third and fourth are

separated by the large tliiid iufralabial, which reachcis the lip border. 
I do not remember any other lizard in which this occurs. In X. vigilis 
there are five inferior labials in an uninterrupted series, the flftli sepa- 
rated from the lip border by a scale. Infralabials six on each side, the 
anterior three larger than the posterior three; the anterior pair in con- 
tact on the middle line, the others separate. The auricular meatus is 
nearly as large as the orbit, and has no processes on its anterior border. 

The dorsal and lateral scales are subround, smooth, and in trans- 
verse series. They are subequal and measure about 0.33 mm. The 
abdominal scales are much larger, are subquadrate and in transverse 
rows. Each row includes fourteen (in the largest sixteen) scales. In 
X. vigilis there are twelve and fourteen. Femoral pores ten (six and 
seven in X. vigilis). Ten large scales in the gular collar. Preanals in 
three series; two narrow series of four scales each in front, and a pair of 
very large scales behind, each bounded by a much smaller scale at the 
posterior outer angle. Scales of limbs rather uniform, larger on the 
external surfaces, largest on the anterior and inferior faces, where they 
nearly equal those of the belly, but have rounded borders. 

Measurements. — Total length (tail complete), 124 mm. ; length to vent, 
50 mm,; total length to axilla, 23 mm.; total length to collar, 18 mm.; 
total length to meatus auditorius, 11 mm. Length of fore leg from 
axilla, 17 mm. ; of fore foot, 6.5 mm. Length of hind leg from groin, 25 
mm.; of hind foot, 10 mm. 

Ground color, light pinkish-gray. This is overlaid by two dorsolat- 
eral rows of large purj)lish-brown spots which are only separated by 
narrow lines of the ground. The tail is marked by two similar rows 
of smaller and more widely separated spots. Hind limbs closely, fore 
limbs sparsely spotted. Head plates purplish-brown, with pale borders. 
Inferior surfaces uniform yellowish. 

I have seen but one specimen of this species. It was sent me by Dr. 
J. H. Rivers, of the University of California, to whom I am also under 
obligations for the first specimens of the species next to be described. 
Dr. Rivers states that the former specimen was taken at Tejon Pass, in 
southern California. 

XANTUSIA RIVERSIANA Cope. 

Xantusia rirersiana Cope, American Naturalist, 1879, p. 801; Proc. Acad. Nat.

RiVEKs, American Naturalist, 1889, p. 1100. 

The scales of the dorsal and lateral regions are rather coarsely and 
uniforudy granular. The abdominal scales are quadrate, and are in 
sixteen longitudinal and thirty-two transverse rows. The preaual 
scales are in three transverse rows, the anterior two of four scales, 
with the median pair in both much enlarged, and the posterior row of 
six scales. Scales of the gular region fiat and hexagonal, one row on 
the gular fold a little larger, and e(iual to the anterior gulars. Scales

of the iiiitcrior aspects of the fore leg aud feiiiui- larger than the 
others; those of the tibia small, aud those of the posterior face of the 
feiimr still smaller. Scales of the tail in whorls of equal width. The 
scales of equal size aud all couvex in cross section, but not keeled. 
None of the scales of the body or limbs keeled. 

The nostril is situated in a small scute at the junction of the sutures 
which separate the internasal, rostral, first labial, and first loreal scuta. 
Three loreals, increasing 
in size posteriorly. A cir- 
cle of scales surrounds 
the eye, of which the supe- 
rior, or superciliary, are 
the largest. Tlie latter are 
separated by one row of 
scales from the parietal, 
frontoparietal, and frontal 
on each side. The fronto- 
nasal is nearly square. 
The internasals are con- 
siderably in contact. The 
frontal is hexagonal, and 
is broader than long. The 
interparietal is as large as 
each parietal. It is longer 
than wide, and notches the 
contact of the frontopari- 
etals. The occipitals are 
large and quadrate. A sin- 
gle large temporal bounds 
the parietals and occipital, 
and it is followed by two 
small scuta, which are in 
contact with the occipital. 
A triangular plate inter- 
venes between the occip- 
ital aud parietal. There 
are eight scales on the 
ui»per lip. Of these the 

fifth is the largest, and is i)art of an annulus which begins with two 
small scales at the posterior loreal and terminates at the seventh scale, 
opposite the middle of the pupil posteriorly. The posterior labials are 
small and are separated by nine rows of still smaller scales fron) the 
large temporal. No larg'e auricular scales. The eye is rather large, 
and its diameter is contained in the length of muzzle in front of it 1.75 
times. Tiie vertical diameter of the auricular meatus is a little less. 

The first digits ot' both extremities are verv short. The second of

tlie i)es is very little longer tbau tbe liftb. All the uugues are acute 
aud are moderately curved. The hiud legs are remarkably short, not 
exceeding the fore legs. Extended forwards the extremity of the fourth 
digit reaches the elbow of the appressed fore leg. Femoral pores twelve 
on each side; no anal pores. The tail is not long, aud its form is com- 
pressed, with a Hat inferior surface. The section is a triangle, higher 
than wide, with the apex narrowly truncate. 

The color is light-brown, with dark umber-brown spots on the supe- 
rior surface. These spots form, in general, one median and two lateral 
rows, but as their forms are very irregular this order is obscure. The 
median dorsals are the largest, and they send branches laterally aud 
anteroposteriorly, so that the result is rather confused. Dark-brown 
bands cross the muzzle on the frontonasal plates aud on the frontal, 
and form a wide U from the frontoparietals passing around the poste- 
rior edge of the occipitals. Sides of head with rather large brown 
spots. Inferior surfaces with minute brown spots, which are least 
numerous on the middle line. Tail with irregular pale spots. 

Measurements. — Total length, 118 mm.; length to posterior edge of 
occipital plates, 16.2 mm. ; length to axilla, 29 mm. ; length to groiu, 55 
mm.; length to vent, (JO mm.; width between orbits above, 7 mm.; 
width at temples, 11.5 mm.; length of forelimb, 17 mm.; length of 
manus, 8 mm.; length of hind limb, 23 mm.; length of pes, 11 mm.; 
length of tibia, 7 mm. 

The species which has given occasion for the above discussion is 
several times as large as the type X. vigilis Baird, and has a different 
coloration. The digits are shorter. The typical specimen was found 
by Dr. J. G. Cooper, zoologist of the State Geological Survey of Cali- 
fornia, and was placed in the collections of the University of California, 
where I saw it. It was kindly lent me for examination by the authori- 
ties of the university. The locality from which the speciuien was 
obtained is San Mcolas Island, one of the Santa Barbara group, coast 
of California. Subsequently, three specimens were obtained from San 
Clemente Island, California, by the naturalists of the Albatross. 

The latter display some differences from the typical specimen, as well 
as among themselves. They all have the temporal plate transversely 
divided, two into three plates and one into two, the anterior the largest. 
In the two smaller specimens the occipitals are divided into two equal 
parts by an oblique suture. In the largest specimen one occipital is 
undivided, as in the type, and the other is about half divided anteriorly 
by an incomplete groove. The character of the two rows of supraorbi- 
tal scales is present in all. The largest specimen is double the size of 
the largest of the X mgilis known. Without the tail, which is injured, 
the length is 85 mm.; length to axilla, 38 mm.; to meatus auditor ius, 
19 mm. 

Three speciuiens from the Santa Barbara Islands were subsequently 
sent me by Dr. Rivers. In all of tliem the temporals are divided, gen-

erally into three scuta, ofwiiich tlie iiiitciioi- is the lar.ner. The total 
length of one of them (tail perfect) is 107 mm. The head plates become, 
in the adults, somewhat corrugated.

ZABLEPSIS Cope. 

Zahlepsis Cope, American Naturalist, 1895, p. 758. 

Pupil erect. The pairs of scuta on the muzzle, the middle pair being 
the divided frontonasals. Frontal undivided; superciliaries present. 
Frontoparietals in contact on the middle line: the occipitals separated 
by an interoccipital. 

The scuta of Xantusiida?, like those of many of the Leptogloss fami- 
lies, are a definite quantity, and very characteristic. I have hence 
proposed to separate this form generically from Xantusia, since it 
differs in the division of the frontonasal and the presence of an inter- 
occipital. The latter plate is only found on this genus in the Xantu- 
siidfc. 

But one species is known, and it inhabits southern California.

Zablepsis henshavii Cope, Auier. Naturalist, August, 1895, p. 758. 
Xantusia lienshawi Stk.inegek, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XVI, ]>. 467. 

Dr. Stejneger's brief description of this s])ecies is as follows: 

Like Xantusia lutjilis it has but one series of superciliaries (or supraoculars), while 
X. liversiuna has two. It is longer and slenderer than the latter, and is more de- 
pressed than either. The color differs from both in being blackish-browu on the 
upper surface irregularly marbled with cream-colored lines which on the tail incline 
toward forming cross bands; under side whitish; scales on back small, uniform, flat 
tubercles; ventral scales in fourteen longitudinal and thirty-three transverse rows, 
preanal scales in three transverse rows, the two median posterior scales being the 
largest; about ten femoral pores on each side. Total length, 148 mm.; length to 
])08terior edge of occipital ])lates, 13 mm.; length to vent, 05 nmi. 

Direct comparison of the type specimens wShows that this species is 
quite nearly allied to the Xantusia picta. It resembles it in the i)ropor- 
tious of the tail and in the flattened head and body. There are a good 
many coincidences in the details of structure, as in the size of the dor- 
sal and ventral scales, and in tlie number of femoral pores. The color-

iition alone would not distinguisli tlic two as species, although 
strikingly different. The differences are, however, important. First, 
the generic characters of two internasals, and an interoccipital plate. 
Second, the hind limb is materially shorter, since when extended it 
only reaches the elbow of the forelimb. Third, the third infralabial 
is not so large, and does not reach the labial border. There are five 
inferior labials reaching that margin instead of four. The third (last) 
pair of preanal plates is not so disi)roportionately large. As points of 
minor importance may be added the ])resence of two wide scales 
between the second pair of infralabials instead of one; and the fact 
that the dark color of the superior surfaces appears on the sides of the 
throat and abdomen, and on the inferior side of the tail, which it does 
not in the A', picta.

Concerning this species Mr. J. Van Benburgh remarks that at Witch 
Creek, San Diego County, California, it lives among the numerous 
granite bowlders, and comes out into the narrower crevices between 
them a few minutes before dark. It is, therefore, practicable to hunt 
for it only about fifteen or twenty minutes each day. If a bit of string 
or a straw be introduced into the domain of one of these lizards it will 
often be seized, the reptile apparently mistaking it for an insect.^

I only kuow this interesting species from the description and figure 
given by Mr. Van Denburgh, which I liere transcribe. The eye is very 
small, without lids, and with vertical pupil. Tbe nostrils are pierced 
at tbe junction of the rostral, internasal, first superior labial, and first 
loreal plates. There are 3 loreals, increasing in size posteriorly. 
There are 2 internasals. The 2 frontonasals are separated by the inter- 
frontonasal, which is in contact also with the 2 frontal plates. The 
other head plates are 2 frontoparietals, 2 parietals, 2 large occipitals, 
and 1 interparietal. The eye is surrounded by a ring of small scales,

of which the superciliaries are largest. This ring is separated from 
the third loreal by 2 small scales. There are 8 superior and 8 inferior 
hibials. The anterior border of the ear is slightly denticulate. The 
ventral plates are arranged in 32 transverse and 10 or 12 longitudinal 
series. The caudal scales are smooth, convex, and in whorls of about 
equal length. The back and sides are covered with smooth convex 
granules of about uniform size. There are 8 and femoral pores. The 
gular regions are covered with smooth, flattened, subhexagonal gran- 
ules, which are slightly larger than those on the back and sides. 

The color above is dark brownish clay dotted with black on single 
granules. A pale yellowish line, two granules wide, runs posteriorly 
from each occipital plate, but is soon lost on the back to reappear over 
the thigh. 

Measurements. — Length to vent (about), 39 mm. ; tail (about), 38 mm. ;

The following description, with slight modifications, is from Boulenger : 

The tongue is flat, more or less elongate, ending in two long smooth points, the 
greater part of its surface covered with rhomboidal, imbricate scale-like papilhe ; 
iu Alopoylossa, these scale-like papilhe are replaced by oblique plicio, as in Xautus- 
siidiK and the Lacertoid genus Tachydromus. In a few genera the tongue is particu- 
larly long and narrow at the base, which is retractile into a sheath ; in the others 
the tongue is bicuspid posteriorly; the whole organ, when the distal points are 
close together, being arrow-headed. 

The teeth vary considerably, but are constantly to be distinguished from those of 
the analogous family Lacertidiu iu not being hollow at the base, the new teeth 
developing iu small sockets at the base of the old ones. In some of the higher 
forms (Tupinambis, Dracaena, Tei us), the lateral teeth are inserted almost on the 
parapet of the Jaws, so that, in fact, they might be termed acrodont; this dentition 
is, like that of the "pleurodonf Amphisbaiuoids, truly intermediate between the 
acrodont and pleurodont. In the other forms the teeth are attached more distinctly 
to the inner side of the jaws and there is a basal shaft. The priemaxillary teeth are 
constantly conical ; the laterals may be conical, bicuspid, tricuspid, obtuse, or molar- 
like (adult Tupinambis), or enormous oval crushers {Draccena); the bicuspid teeth

may lie oitlier compressed longitudin.illy, or perpi-udiciilarly to the jaws {Dicrodon, 
Teius). Pterygoid tcetli are but seldom present, and if so, but feebly developed. 

In the most highly develojied forma the skull presents the typical Lacertilian or 
L'ionocrauian structure; but as we approach the Chakidine forms the skull becomes 
more depressed, the vacuity between the ante and jjostorbital ]»ortion,s and conse- 
quently the interorbital septum become much reduced, the arches weaker, and at 
last we have in Ophiognomon a skull where the pterygoids are largely in contact 
with the sphenoid, the arches are very weak, the columella is so reduced as to bo 
hardly distinguishable, and the whole skull forms an almost continuous solid mass. 

The premaxillary boue is single, the nasals double, the frontal and parietal sin- 
gle; a small supraorbital bone exists in some Ameivas; the palatines are in contact 
anteriorly; the maxillarj'is excluded from the inl'raorbital fossa, which is bounded 
by the palatine, pterygoid, and transverse bone, as in Varanus. The headshields are 
always free from the cranial ossification, a character which separates sharply this 
family from the Old- World Lacertidte. 

Limbs or their rudiments are present; the degradation begins with i'rof<oj>oroM.y, 
which has very short limbs, but with five well-developed clawed digits; the limbs 
are still more reduced in size in Scolecosaurus, and the digital formula is incomplete, 
although claws are still present; in Cophias and OpMoanomon digits are either 
entirely lost or reduced to bud-like rudiments; and in Propiif: the pelvic limbs have 
altogether disappeared. The clavicle is dilated and perforated proxinially ; how- 
ever. Cope mentions Tretioscinvus and Scolecosaurus as forming exceptions, having a- 
simple clavicle; the interclavicle is cruciform. 

I have already noted a peculiarity in the visceral anatomy of this 
family, in the absence of tlie urinary bladder. Tbis structure is 
alleged by sucb authors as Stannius to be present in all Sauria. I 
have Ibund no trace of it in the genera Tupiiiamhis, Braccvna, Ameiva, 
CneinidophoruK, Centropyx, Gymnoplitlialmus, and Callopistes. In all 
these genera the kidneys have a peculiar form, being expanded trans- 
versely for the anterior half of their length, and then tapering poste- 
riorly to a point. In this respect they differ from any family of lizards 
known to me. 

The alimentary canal presents the usual three parts, stomach, small 
intestine, and rectum, with terminal rectal cloaca. There is no especially 
distinguished colon except in Callopistes. In JJracccna a portion of the 
canal immediately succeeding the stomach is constricted off from the 
small intestine for a moderate distance. In Callopistes there is a short 
wide colon without cjiecum. The liver is not elongate, and has only 
one posterior notch. Recurved lobe of the right lobe inconspicuous or 
wanting. The ventral mesentery extends beyond tlie liver to a part 
of the small intestine. 

The mesenteric attachments of the liver are very characteristic in the 
Teiida'. There is but one suspensor, a median gastrohepatic, but tbis 
bifurcates above the middle of the organ and each half diverges, and 
adhering to the caudal margin, extends to the lateral inferior body wall, 
on each side. In Tupinamhis these sheets are united on the median 
line for a distance posterior to the liver. The lungs are each attached 
to the stomach by a'^eparate sheet. The left hepato-parietal sheet is 
always present in tbis family, but the right one is feeble in some genera 
and is easily ruptured, as, for instance, in Cnemidophorus. 1 have

examined the geuera Dracama, Tupinamhis, Callopistes, Ameiva, Gnemi- 
do2)horus, Centropyx, Tejus, Anadia, and Oreosaurus. 

I have examined the anatomy of Propus Cope, the most degraded 
and seipeutiform type of the family, in order to ascertain whether it 
exhibits any affinity to the Annnlati, as supposed by Boulenger, and 
to which it has a strong external resemblance. As the anterior limbs 
only are present, and these are without digits, this genus is even less 
lacertiform than the Annulate Bipes, so far as external appearance is 
concerned. 

Propus has very slender postorbital and supratemporal arches, and 
the paroccipital bone is represented by a relatively rather large nodule 
between the quadrate, the exoccipital and the supramastoid process of 
the parietal. The last-named process is rather short and, like the rest 
of the parietal, is closely applied to the occipital, slightly overlapping 
the latter. The epipterygoid is present, and is in contact with the 
strongly decurved angular lateral margin of the parietal and the 
anterior border of the superior plate of the petrosal. The trigemnial 
notch is as usual in lizards, and the cranial wall anterior to the petrosal 
is membranous. The stapes is very large and its columella is a mere 
tuberosity. 

Scapular and pelvic arches present; anterior limbs only, and these 
minute. 

Scapular arch. — All the elements present, but the sternum represented 
by a narrow longitudinal cartilage, and the interclavicle without lateral 
processes. Clavicle osseous, distally simple; suprascapula cartilagi- 
nous ; scapula and coracoid osseous. Coracoid deeply twice emarginate, 
the emarginations occupied by the coracoid cartilage. Sternum with 
two costal articulations. Fore limbs consisting of humerus and rudi- 
mental ulno-radius. 

Pelvic arch. — This consists of a simple slender costiform bone, directed 
downwards and forwards from the diapophysis of a single vertebra. It 
is homologous wholly or in part with the ilium. 

The lungs are in the position normal to lizards, posterior to (above) 
the alimentary canal.' The left is very much shorter than the right, 
and though bound to the latter by connective tissues is not fused with 
it except at the proximal extremity, and it has no separate bronchus. 
The small intestine is only moderately complex, and there is a short 
but conspicuous caecum at its entrance into the large intestine. The 
liver begins well posterior to the heart, is slender, and has a very 
small left lobe, and a long and narrow right lobe. The gall-bladder has 
the usual position between the two. Kidneys elongate, posterior, 
symmetrical. 

The above characters show that there is not as mutih resemblance to 
the Annnlati in the serpeutiform Teiidae, as there <ip in the Annielloidea, 
which see. 

Two or three types may be observed in the structure of the hemipenis, 

' This is also the case in the jillieil genus Anisocloninni, wterc the digits are 4-X. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZAliDS, AND SNAKES. 559 

but 1 have not bad access to suftu;ient material to euable me to refer 
all tbe genera to the one or tbe otber. In tbe typical members, as the 
genera Dracwno, Tnpinambis, Ameiva, Cncmidophoru.s, and Ccntropi/x, 
the pattern consists of numerous delicate, imbricate, transverse laniiiue, 
which are closely api)lied to each other. Oj^posite the sulcus all the 
genera display a welt, which has free borders. These are entire in Dra- 
c(vn(i, and pectinate in Ameiva and Cncmidophorus. Between these and 
the borders of the sulcus is a rounded welt on each side. The laminaj 
are at first sublongitudinal, diverging proximad from sulcus; on tlie first 
welt they turn sharply distad; between this and the welt they make a 
second chevron, turning proximad. Proximad of the medium welt these 
laminte meet, forming a curve or chevron turned proximad. In Cnemi 
dophnrtiti there is one less chevron. In this genus and Ameiva there is 
a strong fleshy papilla at the apex of each tract between the welt and 
sulcus. 

A modification is seen in Centropyx (pelviceps). Here there is a nar- 
row welt opposite the sulcus. On each side of the sulcus a prominent 
welt diverges from it proximad and approaches the proximal end of the 
median welt, so as to inclose a space with it. It is transversely plicate, 
and the inclosed space on each side the median welt has the delicate 
transverse lamination characteristic of the Teiida\ What is entirely 
peculiar is the presence at the apex of each of the laminate spaces of 
a large patch of acute flexible papilla?. 

The plan is the same in the Anadia bogotensis, but the details are 
quite ditterent. The organ is bifurcate. A strong welt opposite the 
sulcus is divided into five longitudinal folds, which are crimped trans- 
versely. The space between this and the sulcus is marked with folds 
which diverge distad from the welt and become longitudinal, and are 
transversely crimped. In the longitudinal direction of the plicie this 
genus diflers from true Teiida?, and it is likely that I]c2)Ieopus and other 
allied genera are similar. 

In a third type represented by Heteroclonium bicolor a welt bounds 
the sulcus on each side. The space between these is marked by a few 
feeble cross folds, and the borders support a single series of closely 
placed recurved spines. Genera allied to Cophias are likely to pre- 
sent this structure. 

According to Boulenger — 

The Teiiil;!' comprise a large uumber of species, all of which are inhabitants of the 
New World, which show great variety of form and scaling. The Teiidio with Lacer- 
toid and Varanoid a])pearance pass, througli Crocodilurus and NetisHcnrus, into the 
Cercosaurs (to which the latter is nearer on account of its separated nasal plates, 
although placed hitherto with the true Teioids). We have, then, several diverging 
series, the two principal being: Toward Heterodactylus through Arthrosaura, and. 
toward Cophias through Proctoporus. On the other hand, Cophias resembles Hetero- 
dactylus in the position of the nostril, and the latter genus leads us through Pero- 
dactylus to the skink-like genera, such as Iphisa and (i ymnophthalmus, which all agree 
with Heterodactiiliis in the rudimentary condition (or absence) of the inner linger. 
Tlie genera difter as follows: The system adopted is a modification of 
that of Boulenger, but is as yet in a very tentative stage.

The aeconipaiiyiiis table liivestlie geograpliic distribution of the gen- 
era of tbe Teiidie. From this tbe wide distribution of the genus Cnemi- 
dnphorus. and the almost equally wide distribution of the genus Ameivn, 
may be learned. The poverty of the Nearctic Realm is also appar- 
ent, while the richness of the Brazilian and Colombian regions is 
exhibited. The distribution of some of the genera entered in these 
li>ts is not sufliciently well known to make their phice clear. While 
some genera are found in both regions, there is some doubt about otliers 
which ai)pear in both lists, and which have been found in the moun- 
tainous regions of the Andes. It is probable that there is a special 
zoological district in these elevated regions, but whether it is a branch 
of the Colombian or Brazilian district, or distinct from both, is not now 
determinable. Some of the Colombian forms range into Panama and 
Costa Eica.

Verticaria sericea Van Denburgh, Proc. Cal. Acad. Sci., 1895, p. 132, pi. xii. 

The nostrils are in the large anterior nasal plates, which meet on top 
on the snout. The posterior nasal forms sutures with the anterior 
nasal, first and second labials, loreal,]jrefrontal, and frontonasal plates. 
The loreal is in contact with the second, third, and fourth labials, first 
subocular, pieocular, first superciliary, first supraocular, prefrontal, 
and posterior nasal. There are three supraoculars, the first is in con- 
tact with the first and second superciliaries, loreal, prefrontal, frontal, 
and second supraocular; the second is in contact with the frontal; the 
third is separated from the frontal and the frontoparietal by aseries of 
granules. The interparietal is very narrow. There is a series of occip- 
ital plates. There are five superior and six inferior labials to below 
the middle of the eye. The ear opening is not denticulated. The sub- 
labials are separated from the iufralabials by granules. The anterior

gulars are rather large and abruptly separated from the small poste- 
rior gulars. The scales on the collar are very small, largest centrally, 
smaller on edge. The ventral plates are arranged in eight longitudi- 
nal and thirty ti'ansverse rows. The back is covered with small, 
equal-sized granules. The conical tail is provided with scales arranged 
in whorls. The upper caudals have strong diagonal keels, but the 
lower are smooth. There are sixteen femoral pores. The hind limb is 
longer than the distance between the arms and the line of separation 
of the anterior and posterior gulars. 

The back is clove brown, dotted with gray on single granules pos- 
teriorly, with a median bluish- white line which bifurcates on the neck 
about a fourth of an inch behind the occipital plates. There are two 
similar lines on each side; the first originating on the superciliaries

nostril and ending on the thigh. The ground color of the sides is much 
paler than in V. hyperythra, being pale sejiia. The general tint of the 
tail is hair brown above, pale blue below. The ventral and sublabial 
plates, the chin, gular region, and collar are all pale blue.

of a rosette of scales. 

This genus embra(;es many species of the Neotropical realm, exclu- 
sive of the West Indian region, where it is replaced by Ameica. Five 
species enter the Nearctic realm, and all but one of these are restricted 
to the Sonoran region. This one, C. sexlineatus Liiinteus, ranges the 
entire Nearctic, excepting the Hudsonian and Alleghenian districts, 
and the northern parts of the Central and Californian. 

Osteology. — For characters of the skeleton 1 have three individuals 
of the G. tessellatus from my own, and one of the G. sexlineatus from the 
national collection. The alveolar portion of the premaxillary is promi- 
nent, and is marked off from that of the maxillary bone by a shallow 
emargination on each side. The superior spine is long, and the palatal 
border is deeply emargiuate to receive the narrow anterior production 
of the vomers. The nasals are distinct and rather elongate, although 
encroached on in front by the enlarged nostrils. The frontal is single 
and is rather narrow. The parietal is without pineal foramen in the 
adult. The ])arieto(iuadrate arch is well elevated, and is braced below 
by the small paroccipital. The supraoccipital is in close contact with 
the parietal by its middle portion, and it is distinct from the exoccipital 
by suture. The prefrontal does not extend above the orbit; the lach- 
rymal is smaller, but rather large, and forms a suture with the jugal. 
The postfront;\l is wanting, being fused with the i^ostorbital. The 
latter is produced downward and has a longer suture with the supra- 
temi)oral than with the narrow jugal. The quadrate has an external 
conch only. The vomers are elongate and are in contact throughout, 
but each is swollen on the middle line so that they are divided by a 
groove along their common suture. The narial fissure is long and nar- 
row, and is contracted anteriorly, and then enlarged foramen like at 
the anterior extiemity. The vomerine branch of the palatines is longer 
than the maxillary branch; the pterygoid branch is not very wide, and 
the palatine foramen is of moderate size. The ectopterygoid is rather 
wide and has an anterior suture with the palatine bone as well as with 
the maxillary; it is deflected posteriorly. Pterygoid moderately 
expanded anteriorly and contracting gradually; the posterior portion 
but slightly grooved, and attached to the basipterygoid process by its 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 567 

entire width, and not by the groove only. Presphenoid rndimental; 
si)lienoi(l distinguished from basioccipital by suture; the latter with 
descending compressed lateral processes. Petrosal with a short pre- 
seinichciilar process, and a long subforamiual process; the latter ])re- 
senting an open groove downward. Inferior face of frontal grooved, 
jmstoptic not reaching frontal, triradiate, the two superior limbs shorter 
than the inferior. Epipterygoid arising opposite ecto])terygoid and in 
contact with a descending lateral process of the parietal and not touch- 
ing petrosal. 

The hyoid apparatus is distinguished, like that of other Teiida% by the 
great prolongation of the liypohyals anterior to the i)oint of atta(;liinent 
of the ceratohyals. No second ceratobranchials or free ei)ibrancliials. 

In the mandible the Meckelian groove is closed except at the distal 
portion. The coronoid is produced far anteriorly and not at all poste- 
riorly on the external face, and the dentary does not extend niu<;b 
beyond thetootb line. Surangular distinct; angle horizontal, expanded, 
aiid forming an angle inwards. A distinct masseteric fossa, bounded 
below by the angular. Splenial elongate, extending far anterior to the 
splenial foiamen. 

Teeth with the crowns moderately compressed and unequally bicuspid ; 
those of premaxillary and adjacent part of maxillary bone and corre- 
sponding part of mandible, simple. 

Dorsal vertebrae with zygosphen. In both C. tessellatus and C. .sexlin- 
eatus there are live cervical intercentra besides that of the atlas, and 
the first rib is on the third or fourth vertebra. Two sacral dia{>oi)hyses, 
both robust. Xeural spines distinct, moderate, highest in the caudal 
series; ribs exte.nling to sacrum. Diapophyses very short except in 
caudal region, where they extend for a considerable part of the length, 
originating posterior to the middle of the centrum. On the distal part 
of the caudal series there is an additional short spine like diapophysis 
in front of the normal one, and the centrum is segmented between the 
two. The segmentation disappears anteriorly with the disappearance 
of thisprediapophysis. Chevrons intercentral. 

The suprascapula is of moderate dimensions and extends to the 
summit of tiie neural spine. Scapula elongate, and with a large pro- 
scapula. Coracoid with two deep notches. lnter(;lavicle with a very 
long median limb, which is wide at the base and which covers an elon- 
gate oval median fontanelle. Three sternal ribs, and two attached to 
the xii)h()id rod. 

Ilium with a ])rominent anc/ulus crista'. Acetabulum entire; pubis 
directed anteriorly at an acute angle, with median pectineal angle. 
Ischia directed vertically downward, with angulus tuberosns, and pre- 
and post ischiadic acuminate cartilages. 

It is remarkable that in the large species of the allied genus Tupi- 
nambis the j)roscapular process is wanting.

Ill this genus as in others, some characters which are constant in 
one species are inconstant in another. The presence or absence of the 
sixth iufralabial, and of the frenoorbital plates, are of this nature. 
The number of femoral pores varies within a small range in all of the 
forms. Anomalies in the division of the head plates are rare, but 
sometimes occur in these genus. Such are the fusion of the symphys- 
eal and postsymphyseal plates, the presence of an additional labial 
plate, etc. 

The discrimination of the I^orth American species of this genus is 
the most difficult problem in our herpetology. Nowhere are subspecies 
more clearly defined than in Gnemidophorus, that is, definable geograj^h- 
ical forms, which are not always true to their characters. 

The color markings ditfer in the same individual at different ages, and 
the age at which the adult coloration is assumed differs in different locali- 
ties. Some of the species, as for example, Cneniidophorus sexlineatus, 
never abandon the coloration of the young of other species and subspe- 
cies. The same condition is characteristic of the C. deppei of ^Mexico, the 
C. lemniscatns of Brazil, and other species. The i)rocess of color modifi- 
cation is, as I have pointed out,' as follows: The young are longitudi- 
nally striped from two to four stripes on each side of the middle line. 
With increasing age, light spots appear between the stripes in the dark 
interspaces. In a later stage these spots increase in transverse diame- 
ter, breaking up the dark bands into spots. In some of the forms 
these dark spots extend themselves transversely and unite with each 
other, forming black cross-stripes of greater or less length. Thus we 
have before us the process by which a longitudinally strijied coloration 
is transformed into a transversely striped one.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



The large nuuiber of specimens of C. tessellatus and G. gularis in the 
U. S. JS^ational Museum collection show that the breaking up of the 
striped coloration appears first at the posterior part of the dorsal i egion 
(that is, the sacral and lumbar). The confluence of the spots appears 
there first; and finally {C.gularis semi/asciatus), where the color mark- 
ings disappear, leaving a uniform hue, this also api)ears first at the 
posterior i)art of the body. In the C. tessellatus ruMdus the dark spots 
disappear first on the anterior regions. 

The species of Cnemidophorus inhabit dry open ground where they 
can observe their insect prey and watch their enemies. From the lat- 
ter they escape by the extreme rapidity of their movements, which 
renders it difiicult to follow them with the eye, to which they appear as 
a streak flying over the ground. For this reason they are popularly 
known as " swifts." They are nevertheless frequently caught and eaten 
by snakes. 

Of the species enumerated in the synopsis above given, eight are 
not found in the Nearctic realm. Thus €. guttatiis and C. dcppei are 
restricted to the Central American district, and C. cspeutii to certain 
islands of the eastern coast of Central America. C. murinus and G. 
nigricolor belong to the northern parts of South America, and G. ocelli- 
fer, G. Incertoides, and G. lonfjicauda to the southern parts of that conti- 
nent. G. leumiscatuH inhabits tropical South America east of the Andes.

The largest species of the geuus, equaling many of the Ameivas in 
dimensions. Plates of the collar graduating anteriorly into the poste- 
rior gular, the series (concave anteriorly in the middle, leaving smaller 
scales on the margin. Anterior gulars abruptly hirger, the median 
largest. Xostril in nasorostral; superorbitals four, frontoparietals 
separated. Interparietal (in adult) nearly as broad as long; parietals 
large. Infralabials five. I'reanals in four transverse series, the pos- 
terior two containing six. Tibials four, femorals seven, abdominals 
eight, antebrachials (often an unreliable character) lour, brachials seven- 
rowed. Dorsal scales minute. Above olive-brown, with three brown 
bands on each side, which are as wide as the intervals between them, and 
are so broken by si)ots of the gr.)und-col()r as to resemble series of con- 
fluent brown variations. Posterior extremities coarsely reticulate with 
the same color. Superior surface of tail and gular region blackish 
varied; abdominal shields black tipped. Under suiface of tail and 
hinder extremities yellow. Upijer surface crossbarred, so as to appear 
annulate in some specimens. 

Differs from the C ie.sseUatus, its nearest ally, in its smaller and 
more numerous preanal plates, its smaller dorsal scales, and broader 
light bands, as well as in its superior size.

This species varies in the number of its anal ])lates, some specimens 
having fewer than others. The brachial i)lates also vary in number 
from six to eight rows. Two young .specimens (Cat. No. 12{).")8), in which 
the umbilical fissure is still open, are about as large as the adult G. 
sexlineatns. They have a median dorsal light stripe, and two on each 
side on a blackish ground. Each of the two dark bands thus inoduced 
is marked by two rows of pale spots. In this they differ from the 
spotted striped forms of the C. icsscllatus and C. gntiatus^ which have 
but one series of such s])ots. The femur and tibia are crossbarred, and 
the former is not marked with a longitudinal stripe behind.

collar with smaller often granular scales. Four supraorbital scales, 
tlie posterior smaller than tlie others. These are separated from both 
the superciliaries and the frontal and frontoparietal by granular scales 
whose extension anteriorly diflfers in different individuals. Fronto- 
parietals as large as the parietals, truncate in front. Interparietal 
longer than broad, longer than each parietal. The latter undivided. 
A transverse series of small plates bound the parietals and inter- 
parietals posteriorly. Frenal plate longer than postnasal. One row of 
scuta in front of orbit and below orbit, separating the latter from the 
superior labials. Superior labials five to below middle of orbit, the 
fifth acuminate posteriorly. Infralabials five. 

Brachial scales in four to eight longitudinal rows (rarely five) counted 
at the middle, continuous with antebrachials, which are in three rows 
(rarely two). Post-antebrachials small, uniform. Femoral plates in 
seven to nine rows (counted at middle and to the line of pores) and 
tibial plates in three longitudinal rows. Femoral pores varying from 
nineteen to twenty-one in number. 

Color varying from olivaceous black to olivaceous brown, which is 
marked by light yellow or orange longitudinal stripes or spots on the 
dark ground, or reversed by black spots on a light ground. The head 
is unspotted and unstriped, except occasional maculations of the gular 
region. Belly from yellowish to black or spotted. Limbs crossbarred 
or spotted, and not distinctly striped posteriorly. 

The size varies from a length of head and body of 86 mm. to 102 mm. 
In the former the total length is 260 mm.; in the latter, 350 mm. For 
more detailed measurements see under the respective subspecies. 

This species ranges over the Sonoran and Lower Californian regions 
and the Pacific, nearly to the northern boundary of California. Its 
distribution is somewhat coincident with that of the Eutcenia elegans 
(omitting the Kooky Mountains proper), and its eastern border is over- 
lapped by the range of the eastern C. sexlmeatus. The range of varia- 
tions of color seen in the C. tessellatus is about the same as that seen 
in the C. gularis, although, with a few exceptions, the subspecies of 
the two may be distinguished from each other by color characteristics 
without examining the scale characters. The parallelism is, however, 
very close, and shows the same line of modifications. I refer more 
especially to these under the head of C. yularis. 

The subspecies of the C. tessellatus are five, as follows : 

I. BracLial scales 4-5 rows; feinorals 6-7 rows. 

Blackish olive above, with a median dorsal paler stripe, and three similar stripes 
on each side ; belly and throat unspotted C. /. pcrplexus. 

Two pale stripes on each side only, the interspaces pale spotted, and frequently 
broken up into black or olive spots so as to destroy their integrity ; generally 
sparsely black spotted below C. t. tessellatus. 

No stripes, \>\\t 12-14 longitudinal series of pale spots on an olivaceous ground, 
more or less confluent; hind legs with numerous pale spots; thorax, collar, 
and more or less of throat black C. t. melanoateihus.

No stripes; ground color dove brown, with three rows of more or less obsolete 
black spots on the back and vertical black bars on the sides; abdominal 
plates pale, black edged; hands and inferior faces of hind legs and tail red; 
larger C. t. ruiidus. 

III. Brachial scales 7-8 rows; femorals in 8-9 rows.

longer than the postnasal, and there is no frenoorbital. The first pair 
of infralabials are in contact on the median line throughout their length. 
Besides these there a; e four infralabials on each side, which are sepa- 
rated from the inferior labials by tour plates on each side, which are 
preceded by a few granules. Tiiere are four rows of brachial and 
three rows of antebrachial scuta (only two rows at the middle of tlie 
forearm). The femorals are in seven rows, the second from the front 
the largest. The tibials are in three rows, the front the largest. There 
are three large anal plates, two posterior and followed by a granular 
space anterior to the vent. The edge of the collar is granular, and the 
granules form a triangular area with the apex forward. On each side 
of this the scales are about as large as those on the middle of the throat 
between the jaws. The extremity of the fourth toe of the extended 
hind limb reaches to halfway between the humerus and the ear. Fem- 
oral pores 19 on each side. 

MeamremenU. — Total length, 2G0 mm.; length of head and body, 86 
mm.; length of head to angle of jaws, 22 mm.; to edge of collar, 26 
mm.; to axilla, 31 mm.; length of forearm from axilla, 27 mm.; length 
of fore foot, 11 mm.; length of hind leg, 58 mm.; length of hind foot, 
30 mm.; width of head behind orbit, 10 mm. 

The color has already been mainly described. The thigh and tibia 
are longitudinally marbled with dark olive on a pale olive ground. 
Head, fore limbs, and tail unspotted. 

The specimen described is the largest obtained, and it is probably 
adult. Its colors are rather obsolete, while those of three younger 
specimens are as strongly contrasted as in the young of any other form. 
Among all the striped forms of the C. tesfieUatus, this one is distin- 
guished bj^ the presence of seven stripes and no spots. It is, so far 
as yet known, confined to the valley of the Kio Grande Kiver.

A specimen in the museum of the school of biology of the University 
of Pennsylvania, of about the size of the type above described, agrees 
in all important respects with it, with the fidlowing exceptions: The 
second and third iiifralabial plates are in contact with the labials and 
not separated by plates, although some minute granules are iJiesent. 
There are six rows of brachial plates at the middle of the humerus and 
three of antebrachials. The light and dark stripes present a strong 
contrast of color, the former being rosy and the latter pure black. 
The third black stripe on each side is broken into approximated

blocks. The lateral abdominal plates are black at the base, leaving a 
light stripe below the inferior black one, not well defined below. This 
gives the appeaiance of fonr light stripes on each side instead of three. 
Four black spots between orbit and ear, and a few on i)osterior labials 
and front of orbit. Legs strii)ed and reticnlate with black on a i»ale 
ground. I add that there are ID femoral i)ores, and that the extended 
hind leg reaches the front border of the auricular meatus. 

This form approximates this subspecies to the C. t. iessellaius. The

The scale characters of this subspecies are much like those of the 
C. t. perplexus. The interparietal i)late is generally laiger, exceeding 
the parietals, and being nearly as wide in front as it is long. The first 
pair of infralabials is separated by scales ])Osteriorly. The larger scales 
of the mesoptychium extend all the way across it, and they are pre- 
ceded by a considerable tract of small scales, which are in turn pre- 
ceded by the large gulars rather abruptly. The brachial scales are in 
four rows and the antebrachials in three. The feniorals are in seven 
(rarely six or eight) and the tibials in three. Femoral pores from 19 
to 21, The hind limb extended, reaches the tympanic meatus with 
the end of the longest toe. The anal plates are four to six in number — 
two posterior and two arranged anteroposteriorly in front of them. 

Measurements. — Tolal length, 335 mm.; length of head and body to 
vent, lOli mm.; length of head to angle of mandible, -0 mm.; length to 
collar, 35 mm.; length to axilla, 42 mm.; length of foreleg, 34 mm.; 
length of forefoot, 1<> mm.; length of hind leg, 73 mm.; length of hind 
foot, 37 mm. 

The adult differs from the young in color, and its colors may be best 
understood by reference to the latter. In this stage the ground color 
of the back and sides is black or blackish olive, and it is traversed by 
two light-yellowish stripes on each side. One of these starts at the 
occipital plate and the other at the superciliary angle. The lateral

stripe, which extends from above the auricular meatus in the G. t. per- 
plexus, is here wanting. There is sometimes a trace of a median dorsal 
stripe, but generally not. Faint longitudinal lines are sometimes pres- 
ent between the stripes mentioned. On the sides below the external 
stripe are three series of more or less longitudinal spots, which outline 
three stripes ; but they are not connected, excepting sometimes in tbe 
transverse direction. This stage represents the C. gracilis Baird and 
Girard. 

In maturer specimens rounded spots appear between the longitudinal 
stripes, and the lateral spots become connected transversely, so as to

leave the dark ground color in the form of irregular transverse bars 
(Cat. Nos. 3017, 4970, 15619). In some specimens tbe median dorsal 
stripe is distinct, and is even divided into two (Cat. No. 11978). Such 
specimens have six stripes, very close together, and only the external 
pair on each side are homologous of those of the C. sexUneatns and G. 
gtdaris. In tbe majority of adult specimens the light spots expand 
transversely and produce an emargination on one side or the other of

the black grouud, or cut it into sectious or spots by expanding in both 
directions. In the former case the dark stripes become irregular or 
undulate in outline. This is their usual condition on tlie anterior part of 
the body. On the posterior part of the body the dark ground is usually 
broken into spots. In the type specimen of the (J. tigris Baird and 
Girard, the breaking up of the black intervals has not been completed, 
although the specimen is of full size. In typical specimens this part

of the body is marked by three longitudinal rows of transverse black 
spots. The upper surface of the tail is generally marked with brown^ 
spots, sometimes rather large, but in other specimens confined to the 
keels of the scales. In some they are wanting. 

In the last modification the traces of stripes have almost or quite 
disappeared. The upi)er pair are first to be interrupted by transverse 
and oblique extensions of the irregularly shaped black spots, and the 
inferior stripes are finally interrupted and lost in the same manner.

Thus, iu Cat. Nos. 8633 and 3048tt, the spots are transversely confluent in 
every direction, leaving only irregular areas of the white color, now 
become the ground. These approach nearest to the G. t. variolosus Cope 
and represent the C. marmoraUis of Baird and Girard. In the type of 
that supposed species a trace of the inferior stripe remains on each 
side. The end of the fourth toe of the extended posterior foot reaches

the meatus auditorius, and there are twenty femoral pores on each side. 
The length of the head and body is 85 mm. ; in Cat. No. 8633 it is 
100 mm. 

The habits of Cnemidophorus tessellatus tigris are referred to by 
Dr. Merriam in his report on the Death Valley expedition, as follows: 

The whip-tail lizard is nearly as commou as the gridiron tail in much of the area 
traversed, but is not so strictly confined to the Lower Sonoran Zone, ranging up a

short distance into Ihe Upper Sonorau, aud consequently reaching some valleys in 
which the former species is al)sent. In this respect it resembles the leopard lizard 
{Crotaphytus wlzltzenH ), with which it is usually found. It lives on the open desert 
and runs with great rapidity when alarmed. 

Ill California it is abundant in the Mohave Desert, where it ranges 
westward through Antelope Valley to the Canada de las Uvas (changing 
to subspecies undulatns), aud southward in the wash leading from near 
Gorman station toward Peru Creek, in the Sierra Liebrc. In the open 
cafion leading up to Tehachapi Valley froni the Mohave Desert it ranges 
all the way to the summit of the pass (at Cameron) and probably 
throughout Tehacha])i Valley also, but was not seen there because of a 
severe cold wind, which lasted all day at the time we passed through. 
It ranges up from the Mohave Desert over Walker Pass and down on 
the west slope to the valley of Kern River, where it changes to sub- 
species nndulatus. It is common in Owens Valley, and ranges thence 
up on the warm, west slope of the Inyo and White Mountains to 2,130 
meters (7,000 feet) or higher, opposite Big Pine; and is tolerably com- 
mon also in Deep Spring Valley. It is common in Panamint, Death, 
and Mesquite Valleys, ranging from the latter through Grapevine Canon 
to Sarcobatus Flat. In Nevada it is common in the Amargosa, Pah- 
rump, and Vegas Valleys, at the Bend of the Colorado, in the valleys 
of the Virgin and Muddy, and reaches Oasis, Pahranagat, Desert, aud 
Meadow Creek Valleys, and from the latter ranges up among the juni- 
pers on the west slope of the Juniper Mountains, to an altitude of 1,980 
meters (6,500 feet). In Utah it is common in the Lower Santa Clara 
Valley, and thence ranges northward to the Upper Santa Clara Cross- 
ing, but disappears before reaching Mountain Meadows. 

The food of Cneniidophorus tigris consists of grasshoppers and other 
insects; no leaves or flowers were found in the numerous stomachs 
examined. 

Hallowell in describing this subspecies as C. nndulatus recognized the 
difference between it and the C. t. perplexus, remarking that the present 
form has but two light stripes on each side. 

This form ranges the Sonoran region to Utah inclusive, and extends 
to the northern part of California.

elevated. Brachial scales in five, antebrachials in three rows. Fem- 
orals in seven, tibials in three rows. Hind leg- extended reaching 
auditory meatus in front. Femoral pores 20-22. 

Measurements. — Total length, 315 mm.; length to angle of mandible, 
25 mm.; length to edge of collar, 29 mm.; length to axilla, 35 mm.; 
length to vent, 8i> mm. ; length of fore limb, 32 mm. ; length of fore foot, 
14mm.; length of hind leg, 63 mm.; length of hind foot, 34 mm. 

The general appearance of the coloration of this species is that of a 
multitude of rather small grayish-yellow spots closely ])laced on a 
ground of grayish olive. These may be counted as forming from four- 
teen to sixteen rows between the abdominal plates of one side and 
those of the other along the back. There are several black ci escentic 
spots from the axilla posteriorly. The hind limbs and the posterior 
side of the fore limb are spotted like the back. Thorax and collar, and 
more or less of the gular region, black. Belly scales with black bases. 
Tail uni color above and below, the distal three-quarters of the inferior 
surface black. A black spot in front of the meatus auditorius, and 
another below the posterior border of the orbit. A few shades on side 
of head; top of head uniform olive. In one of the specimens the spots 
on the middle dorsal region are obsolete, the result being a grayish 
olive hue. 

The coloration of this subspecies is something like that of the C. 
variolosus, but that is another species. The interparietal plate is nar- 
rower than in the C. t. tessellatus, and the black breast and gular region 
are not seen in it. 

A number of young specimens accompany the two adults described. 
They have two narrow stripes on each side of the middle line, and the 
spaces between them contain each a row of pale spots. The thorax is 
not black. These resemble the young of C. t. tessellatus {G. gracilis) 
but the latter has brighter colors, and when the spaces between the 
stripes contain marks they are delicate longitudinal lines (Cat. No. 3034, 
type of C. gracilis). 

This form is only known from the Colorado River of Arizona.

flat scales. Iiifralabials 5, with two large scales posteriorly above the 
last two. Gular scales medially rather large, twice or thrice as large 
as the laterals, and eciualiiig those of the mesoptychiiiui. The latter 
are of moderate size, and are in several transverse series, the posterior 
smaller at the sides, but not granular. Keels of caudal scales in con- 
tinuous lines; femoral pores 20-:il. 

Old specimens black above and below, except the hind legs, palms, 
and median line of tail below. The superior face of the hind leg is 
dark olive, closely variegated with light olive. The posterior face of 
the femur is yellowish, with three black longitudinal stripes; the infe- 
rior, which runs along the posterior edge of the femoral pores, is 
narrow, and sometimes wanting; and the superior pale stripe is some- 
times imperfect. In younger specimens of adult size seven narrow, 
regular stripes a little paler than the ground color may be seen, three 
on each side of a median vertebral one. The interspaces are obscurely 
pale, spotted. The inferior stripe extends from the groin to the axilla. 
In such specimens the coloration of other regions is like that of the 
adult. Accompanying these is a smaller and probably younger speci- 
men, which nevertheless contains two eggs which have very much the 
color of the C. sexUneatus. There are seven olive stripes on a black 
ground, not so bright as on the species named. The under surfaces are 
white, except the mesoptychium and sides of throat, which are dusky. 
The limbs are black above, the cubitus with two longitudinal stripes 
behind, and the thigh with two yellow stripes and a yellow space below 
posteriorly. Superior face of thigh with two more or less interrupted 
longitudinal stripes; lower leg with three. No spots in the spaces 
between dorsal stripes.

This form resembles most the G. t. melanostethus, but the coloration 
is different in several respects. The uniform black color of the adults 
is unknown in the latter, and the striping of the legs, especially of the 
hind legs in the adult, is equally a peculiarity of the present form. 
The possession of 6 stripes instead of 4, or 3 on each side of the median 
line, alters this form to the C. t. perplexus rather than to the C. t. 
melanostethus. 

Of the specimens 2 present the adult coloration, 3 of equal size 
with the adults the obscurely striped, and 1, the smallest, the distinctly 
striped.

A form very much like this subspecies has been named C. martyris 
by Stejneger.^ The two known specimens differ from the C. t. melano- 
stethtts in their smaller size and in the extension of the black over the 
entire inferior surface. It is doubtful whether it can be regarded as a 
subspecies. It is from the island of San Martir, Gulf of California.

This elegant form is represented in the national collection by seven 
individuals, of which three are adult. To the usual characters of the 
species it adds some others. Thus the scales are rather finer, being 
less than 0.5 mm. in diameter. The femoral scales are more numerous. 
Femoral pores twenty- two. Small scales of collar border not granular. 

There are three parietals, and the longest toe reaches the auricular 
meatus. There are the usual three anals, with one in front of the

median, which is, with the latter, bounded by a few scales on the sides. 
Median gular scales rather coarse, and abruptly contrasted with the 
posterior gulars in a transverse line. Loreal longer than high. Small 
scales above anterior canthus of eye numerous and rather prominent. 
The keels of the caudal scales are prominent, and, except at the base of 
the tail, in continuous lines. 

The color of the upper surfaces in the adult is a dove brown. This is 
marked on the back by three series of transverse black spots, which are 
well separated from each other. In one specimen the spots are very 
narrow; in another they are nearly obsolete on the anterior part of the 
back. On the sides similar black spots are more or less confluent 
into vertical black stripes. The head and fore legs are uniform brown 
above; the hind limbs have on a similar ground narrow blackish cross- 
bars, sometimes indistinct. Tail pale brown above, with olive and 
brown spots. Inferior surfaces straw-colored tinged with green, and 
varied with black and red. The abdominal scuta are black bordered, 
and the throat is black spotted, sometimes strongly, sometimes faintly. 
The palms and sometimes the entire inferior surface of the anus is 
a bright vermilion. Posterior and inferior sides of femora, inferior 
aspect of tibia, and inferior side and distal half of tail bright vermilion. 

The young specimens have traces of six longitudinal stripes of an 
olivaceous or light-brown color, and the spaces between them are cross- 
barred with black and olive, as in the C. (jularu tnariariim, which this 
form closely resembles at this stage. The black spots become more 
distinct with age, and the interspaces blend completely with the 
stripes, so that the latter are ultimately completely lost in a common 
ground color. The femora are reticulated with black on an orange 
ground above. The black and red of the inferior surfaces are not so 
pronounced as in the adult. 

Measurements. — Total length, 340 mm.; length to posterior edge of 
ear, 24 mm.; length to collar, 34 mm.; length to vent, 100 mm.; length 
of fore limb, 35 mm.; length of hind limb, 72 mm.; length of hind foot,

C. t. rubidus, but they graduate into them. The extended hind leg 
reaches to the orbit. In two larger specimens there are six plates of

the iiifralabial row, and in two smaller but five. Four large anals, two 
on the middle line in front of the marginal pair. These four are sur- 
rounded by a series of smaller plates as far as the vent. Scales of the 
t^ul with the keels slightly oblique throughout. The i)eculiarity of the 
subspecies is seen in the large number of rows of brachial scales (7-8 
rows), and femoral scales (8-9 rows). The former are not quite con- 
stant, however, one of the smaller specimens having but six rows. 
Femoral pores 20-22. The scales are smaller than is usual in G. tessel- 
laius, measuring 0.33 mm. and 0.25 mm. in diameter. 
The color is generally of the C. tesseUatus tessellatus type, but the

black ground color is more persistent. The light stripes are most broken 
up posteriorly, aud the communicating pale cross spots are widest and 
most numerous. On the sides the pale spots are of irregular shapes, 
being both longitudinal and transverse on a black ground. Belly black 
and light olive in varying proportions. Gular region and collar with 
transverse black spots or bands. Fore limbs black with light olive 
spots; hind limbs brown with blackish reticulation. Tail brown above, 
black-spotted below. 

I took a specimen which differs in no respect from this subspecies 
on the road between Eeno and Pyramid Lake in western Nevada. The 
only difference is in the coloration, since the black between the stripes 
is comjiletely cut up into short transverse bars not wider than the light- 
brown intersi)aces.

CNEMIDOPHORUS TESSELLATUS VARIOLOSUS Cope. 

Cnemidophorns tessellatus variolosus Cope, Trans. Amer. Phil. Soc, 1892, p. 39, 
pi. VIII, fig. 6. 

This species exhibits the general scale characters of the G. tessellatus, 
but possesses some peculiarities. The interparietal plate is twice as large 
as either parietal. Infralabials five. The scales of the brachium and 
of the femur are smaller and more numerous than in the C. tessellatus. 
There are six rows of the former, four being the usual number in the 
latter species; and eight of the latter, six or seven being the usual 
number. Brachial rows three; tibials three. Anal scuta with the 
lateral scales rather larger than usual, giving four large and six small 
ones in all. Femoral pores more numerous, twenty-five on each side. 
This species is especially characterized by the length of the hind leg, 
which reaches, when extended, to the postnasal plate, instead of to the 
meatus auditorius only. The scales of the mesoi 'tychium extend all the 
way across, and are not interrupted at the middle by the smaller ones 
as in the C. t. perplexus. The marginal scales are smaller. Posterior 
gular scales are smaller, bounded in front by the larger scales of the 
anterior gular region.

ground of the su])erior surfaces is marked with numerous ratiier small 
yellowish oval spots. Those of the sides are irregularly disposed, but 
those of the superior surfaces are arranged in six more or less irregu- 
lar series. Of these the two extermil ou each side correspond with the 
two external stripes of the young of the C. te-ssclUtlns. Ou the nape the 
series lose their regularity, and on the nape region they are more fre- 
quently transverse. The hind legs are olivaceous, marked with numer- 
ous irregular oval yellow spots. Xo stripe on the posterior face of the 
femur. Head without spots or stripes. Gular region dark olive ; thorax 
blackish : belly yellowish, the scales with black bases. Tail olive with 
scales above yellowish at the base, brownish beyond; below brown 
except the basal fourth, which is yellowish with black spots on most of 
the scales. Posterior limbs with oval yellowish spots ou an olivaceous 
ground. Femur not stri])ed behind. 

This species resembles the C. maxhnus in the increased number of 
its femoral pores and femoral and brachial scales, but is distinguished 
by its much longer hind leg, spotted coloration and much smaller size.

stripes of the same tint on each side. The external three of these are 
homologous with those of the G. tessellatus perplexus and the C. sex- 
lineatus, and the additional five are median and equidistant from the 
other stripes and from each other. There are no spots on any part of 
the body, head, tail, or limbs. 

This si^ecies diifers from the young specimens of the ('. tessellatus of 
equal size, in the small number of its ff.moral pores, and in the absence 
of spots on the hind limbs and sides, as well as in the additional pair 
of median longitudinal stripes. The single known specimen is appar- 
ently adult, and is about equal in size to a half-grown C. iesselatiis, and 
smaller than the C. variolosus.

tbe orbit aud passes over tlie tympanum; the next begins above the 
anterior border of the orbit aud marlcs the external borders of the supra- 
orbital plates. The next issues from a parietal plate. Anteriorly the 
black interspaces have a few small spots; posteriorly they become 
undulate through lateral emarginatious, and more posteriorly the first 
and second stripes are broken up into quadrate spots, the third remain- 
ing unbroken. The hind legs are very indistinctly marbled on an olive- 
gray ground. The fore legs are coarsely reticulated with black on an 
olive ground. The lateral dark stripes extend to the orbit, and there 
is a blackish shade on the side of the muzzle, just below the canthus 
rostralis. Lower surfaces everywhere yellowish unspotted, except a 
few black specks on the inferior labials and sides of the gular region. 
Tail olive above, yellowish below. 

This species belongs to the C. sexUneatus series, as indicated by the 
scales of its collar, but it has the coarse scales of the G. te.sselhitus. Its 
six infralabial scales are found only in the former series. Its colora- 
tion resembles in some degree the stage of the C. tesseUattis tessellatus, 
called by Baird and Girard C. tigris, but it has seven stripes instead of 
four, aud the lateral stripes are broken up aud not the median, as is 
the case in the latter. It also differs from the latter in the marking of 
the fore leg and nearly uniform coloration of the hiud leg, the reverse 
being the case in the C. tessellatus. The striping of the head is also not 
seen in the latter. The head is also narrower in proportion to its length. 

This, perhaps the handsomest species of the genus, is represented in 
the collection by au adult female only.

pores varying in number from 15 to 17. Principal anal scuta three — two 
marginal, the thiid anterior. The longest toe of the extended hind leg 
reaches to the anterior border of the meatus auditorius. 

The head is rather short, compressed at the sides, and rounded at the 
snout in profile. The front plate is large and pentagonal, broad before 
and narrower behind. On each side there are two large, irregular

rlioaiboidal su[)eri()r orbital plates, wliicli supply the place of bony- 
orbits, in front of which is Ji smaller plate, reaching to the fronto-nasal, 
and II still smaller plate behind them. On the outer margin of these 
are two series of small scales, beyond which is a row of seven narrow, 
elongated plates that form the superior margin of the orbit; the fronto- 
nasal plates are regularly jjeutagonal, broadest externally; the inter- 
frontonasal broad transversely, rounded before and acute.-augled be- 
hind; the nasals are quadrilateral, rather elongated, meeting in the 
mesial line above; the opening for the nostril is in its most inferior 
part, near the postnasal plate, which is triangular, with its basis below 
and apex above and prolonged. The frontoparietal, interparietal, and 
parietal plates are nearly all of the same size; the two fronto parietals 
are truncate in front. The interparietal is longer than wide and par- 
allelogramic in form; with the jiarietals, it is bounded posteriorly by 
small plates, of wliich there are several series behind. There are three 
inferior orbital plates, placed nearly in a row; the central is quadrilat- 
eral, elongated, and narrow; the two others are very small. There is 
a single loreal plate, pentagonal and large, ascending to the plane of the 
forehead. The upper jaw is covered at its inferior margin with a row 
of five small, square, labial plates; the anterior only is trigonal and 
smallest. There are two series of plates to the lower jaw, the inferior 
largest, and consisting of five jDlates, of which those of the anterior pair 
are in contact with each other. The eyes are rather small, with a 
dusky pupil and a golden iris; the inner margins of the eyelids are bor- 
dered with a very narrow band of bright yellow; the membrane of the 
tympanum is apparent and of a i)alish white color; the entrance to it 
is round and of large size. The body is elongated and covered on the 
back and sides with minute scales, which measure .33 mm. in diameter 
in the adult. The scales of the abdomen are large and arranged in 
eight rows, of which those nearest the middle are largest. The tail is 
very long, perfectly cylindrical, and covered with verticillated scales, 
carinated above and smooth below. The vent is transverse and has in 
front three large scales, placed in a triangle, two posterior to the other 
and witli smaller scales behind. 

The anterior extremities are well developed, rounded, covered above 
at the shoulder with five to six rows of large scales, and with two rows 
still larger and a smaHer row on the front of the forearm ; their inferior 
surface is granulated. The fingers are scaled to the root of the nails, 
which are short, small, delicate, and (uirved. The posterior extremities 
are twice the size of the anterior; the thigh above is covered with 
granulations, and below with six or seven rows of large scales ; the leg is 
covered like the thigh, but there are three rows of still larger scales 
below; the tarsus is granulated on its inferior, and has two rows of scales 
on its superior surface. The fourth toe is very long, and the first and fifth 
are subequal; all are armed with short, small, curved claws. There is 
a range of from 15 to 17 femoral pores under the thigh. 



596 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

The head is dusky browu; the upper jaw bluish white; the lower 
nearly of a silver-white color. Along the back extends, from the occi- 
put to the tail, a i)urple or brownish band, on each side of which are 
three yellow or golden longitudinal lines; of these, the superior is the 
palest and shortest; it begins at the parietal plate and terminates at 
the tail; the other lines are much longer and brighter, the upper one 
beginning above the orbit and extending to the middle of the tail; the 
lower line begins below the eye and runs above the tympanum, along 
the tlauks to the anterior part of the thigh ; a shorter and more indis- 
tinct line extends from the angle of the mouth, below the tympanum, 
to the shoulder; the spaces between these longitudinal bands are jet- 
black. The throat is silver-white, and the abdomen of a shining bluish- 
white color. The upper surface of the tail is nearly similar in color to 
the back, but appears much rougher from the verticillated scales; its 
inferior surface is whitish. There are two longitudinal lines ou each 
side of the tail; the superior one is continuous with the central yellow 
longitudinal line of the back, and terminates about the middle of the 
tail; the inferior line is paler, it begins back of the thigh, runs nearly 
to the extremity of the tail, and seems to divide the upper or darker 
portion from the inferior or whiter part. 

The anterior as well as the posterior extremities are brownish above 
and bluish-white below, and along the posterior part of the thigh runs 
a whitish line continuous with the inferior longitudinal line of the tail, 
bordered by darker above and below. 

Measurements. — A specimen from Piney Point, Marj'^land (Cat. I^o. 
925G). Total length, 235 mm.; length to angle of mandible, 18 mm.; 
length to collar, 21 mm. ; length to axilla, 27 mm. ; length to vent, 70 mm. ; 
length of forelimb, 21 mm.; length of forefoot, mm.: length of hind 
leg, 50 mm.; length of hind foot, 28 mm; width of head at front of 
tympana, 10 mm. 

This is one of the smallest species, and it retains the young type of 
coloration everywhere. It is also distinguished by its short and high 
muzzle and the absence of postautebrachial scales. It covers the 
Austroriparian region of the Nearctic realm and the Eastern as far as 
the range of the Carolinian district, extending to Maryland and Dela- 
ware, but not Xew Jersey. In the Central region it reaches north to 
the Sand Hills of the Loup Fork Eiver of Nebraska. The only diffi- 
culty in defining it is found in specimens from the region which is also 
inhabited by the C. gularis. In Texas, New ]Mexico, and Arizona the 
species merge into each other. If we refer s[)ecimens with fewer than 
eighteen femoral pores and no spots between the stripes or on the sides 
to the C. sexUneaius, we find that in certain specimens from the region 
in question the postautebrachial scales are larger than in eastern 
specimens, though not so large as in the true C. [/ularis. iSuch are 
Cat. Xos. 4800,8159, 118;3!», and 14787. In another series the postaute- 
brachial scales are equally intermediate in size and there are no spots,

but the femoral pores are iii enlarged numbers. Such are Cat. Xos. 
4788, 11885, 14219, aud ir)(i07. From these we pass easily to the true 
G. s. gnlaris, with large postantebrachials and spotted spaces.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



It is seen by tbe above table that the most northwestern locality for 
this form is tlie Sand Hills of the Loup Fork Eiver of Nebraska (Cat. 
No. 3144). Next to it in the same region is Cat. No. 5090 from the 
Eepublican Eiver, in northern Kansas.

This species is represented by two forms, which difl'er, so far as 
appears, in coloration only. The one is found in western Texas, the 
other in southern and Lower California. They differ as follows : 

Eight rows of black spots above and on the sides ; belly and throat little or not 

black spotted C.g. f/rahamii 

Nine rows of black spots above ; belly and gular region black spotted. C. g. siejnegerii

ceeding- from the parietal and superciliary scales. At the scapular 
region the black spaces are broken iuto square spots, forming three 
longitudinal series, one median. The other black spaces form trans- 
verse bars on the sides, and they are sometimes united above, forming 
inverted Vs. They tend to fuse with the dorsal series posteriorly, and 
in one of the types this is completed, thus forming irregular black 
cross bars. The superior surfaces of both limbs are black, with large 
yellow spots, Superior dark band extending as shades on the supra- 
orbital plates. A pale light stripe from orbit over meatus auditorius. 
Gular region unspotted. Black spots covering, or on the base onl}^ of, 
some of the lateral abdominal scuta. Tail with two or three rows of 
dark spots on an olive ground above; below unspotted. Posterior face 
of femur with yellow spots separated by vertical dark lines. 

But two specimens of this form are contained in the U. S. National 
Museum, the original types of Baird and Girard. In one of these there 
are six infralabial scuta on both sides, and in the other there are but 
five on one side. On the other side there are spaces for six, but two 
are fused into one, so that I believe that six is the normal number for 
this subspecies as it is for the others. Two other specimens were 
obtained by Mr. W. L. Black, of the geological survey of Texas, at 
Tule Canyon on the Staked Plain. They differ only from the presence 
of a median dorsal zigzag light stripe. 

Baird's figure represents this handsome form very well.

CNEMIDOPHORUS GRAHAMII STEJNEGERII Van Denburgh. 
Cnemidophorus stejnegeri Van Denburgii, Proc. Cal. Acad. Sci., IV, 1894, p. 300. 
The following description is by Van Denburgh : 

Adnlt male (Type No. 1861, Leland Stanford .Tiinior University Mnsenm, collected 
by J. M. Stowell between San Rafael and Ensenada, Lower California, .Tune 8, 1893). 
Nostril anterior to uasal sutnre; 3 parietals, 2 frontoparietals, 1 8n])raornlars, (5 
siiperciliaries; nasal not reachini^ second superior labial ; postnasal in contact with 
both first and second superior labials. Posterior ijjnlar scales rather larg'e, abruptly 
separated from the verj' large and convex anterior gulars. ^ Plates of collar very 
large, but smaller along its edge. Ventral plates in eight longitudinal rows. Back, 
neck, and upper surfaces of limbs covered with very small, smooth, convex gran- 
nies. Five rows of brachial plates ; three rows of antebrachials ; no post-antebrachial 
plates. Femoral rows in seven rows. Twenty and twenty-two femoral pores. Scales 
on tail large, oblique, slightly pointed, and with strong diagonal keels. 

Color above yellowish-brown posteriorly, becoming grayish toward head, paler 
on sides, with nine longitudinal rows of very irregular black spots. Upper surface 
of limbs similarly marked. Plack markings on sides of head and neck and on gular 
region large and well defined. Lower surfaces creamy white, maculated with black.

£ra6i<a<.— Northwestern Lower Califoruia and Sau Diego County, California. 

Twelve other specimens collected by Mr. Stowell at the type locality at San Telmo 
and in the foothills of the San Pedro Martir Mountains, Lower California, do not 
differ from the type in any important particular. The number of femoral pores 
varies from nineteen to twenty-five, of brachial plates from four to five rows, and of 
antebrachials from two to three rows. 

Forty-one specimens from San Diego County, California (collected in Santa Ysabel, 
Clogstous, and Hemet valleys; at San Jacinto and in the Julian Mountains, by 
Messrs. Hyatt and Stoddard), are essentially like those from Lower California but 
average slightly paler in general coloration. 

Cnemidophori from northern Lower California and from San Diego County, Cal- 
ifornia, iiresent much the general appearance of C. iigrls undulatus (Hallowell). 
They difl"er from that form in having the dorsal scales smaller, the gular scales and 
the scales on the collar larger, and in the presence of large and well-defined black 
spots on the gular region. From C. tigris B. & G. they differ by character of the 
scales as above indicated, by the absence of the slate-colored suffusion on the gular 
regions, and by the well-defined black markings on the side of the head. 

The form does not appear to be very different from the C.graJiamii 
grahamii, but the collar scales are somewhat differently arranged, and 
the color is somewhat different. Mr. Van Denburgh has shown the 
characters to be constant in a large number of individuals.

Cnemidophorus guttatus Hallowell, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1854, p. 192. 

This species is allied to the C. sexlineatus, but is distinguished by the 
presence of post-antebrachiai plates, the more numerous femoral pores 
and the longer muzzle. It is very variable as to size and color, but the 
dark spaces between the light stripes are always marked, interrupted 
or completely broken up by light spots or spaces, except in the young. 
The color variations are similar to those already mentioned under the 
head of the C. tessellatus, but they are more numerous. Specimens from 
western Texas come nearest in character to the C. sexlineatus. It takes 
the place of that species throughout Mexico, also replacing the C. 
tesseUatus in the drier parts of that country. Besides the characters 
already cited, this species differs from the C. tesseUatus in its liner 
scales. These measure from .25 to .33 mm. in diameter, while those of 
the C. tesseUatus measure .5 mm.; but this character does not always 
hold good.

variations follows quite closely those pointed out by European authors 
to exist in the Lacerta mnrnlis. These have been made the subjects of 
especial study by Professor Kimer, of Tiibingen, from whose paper- I

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



There are some color forms in the Lacerta miiralis which are not 
repeated in the North American Cneraidophori, particularly those 
which result in a strong contrast between the dorsal colors as a whole 
and the darker lateral colors as a band. The color variety, No. G, of 
the Cneniidophori is not reported by Elmer as occurring in the Lacerta 
muralis.

tinguish it from tlie C. sexUneatus, while the six longitudinal stripes 
on a (lark iirouiul have the same origins and terminations as in that 
species. The only difference in the squaniatioii is seen in the presence 
of one or two rows of large scutes on the posterior face of the forearm. 
Accompanying this character is a larger number of femoral pores, which 
range from eighteen to twenty-two, averaging about twenty, as against 
sixteen and seventeen of the eastern form. Specimens having such 
characters generally have a single series of light spots in the dark 
spaces between the longitudinal stripes, which are not confluent with 
the light stripes, and which do not therefore break up the dark stripes 
into spots. The majority of such specimens have light spots on the 
sides below the inferior stripe. In some smaller specimens, presuma- 
bly females and young, all the spots are wanting. In this subspecies 
the frenoocular jdate occasionally ai)pears. The general proportions are 
as in C. s. se.vlineatiis, the longest toe of the extended hind leg reaching 
to the front of the meatus auditorius. The size of adults exceeds a 
little that of the eastern form, a specimen from Arizona (Cat. No. 5020) 
measuring 100 mm. from the end of the snout to the vent. This is, 
however, larger than the average. 

This form is found in western Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, and 
in Mexico as far south as Chihuahua and Monterey. 

Certain specimens agree in all respects with this subspecies, except 
in the possession of a smaller number of femoral pores. Such are Cat. 
Nos. 3055. 3022, 3000, 3010, 3071, 1871, and 9247. Cat. No. 3022 includes 
five specimens, which present the typical characters of the subspecies, 
but add a peculiarity, in which they all agree, namely, the possession 
of six infralabial plates, thus approaching the C. grahamii. The males 
have the thoratdc region black and the abdominal scales more or less 
margined with the same color. The same color character appears in 
a few other specimens, and in Cat. No. 15C04 there are six infralabials 
on one side.

This form resembles the C. s. sexlineatns more than any other, but 
always possesses the postantebrachial plates and more numerous femo- 
ral pores, which range from eighteen to twenty-two. Occasional speci- 
mens are, however, intermediate between the two. Its range is the 
Sonoran region. 

Under this subspecies must be placed four of the series of forms 
which I described in my paper on the reptilia of Chihuahua as sub- 
species of the C. sexlineatns ' in the following language, two of the 
forms (IS'os. 5, 6) being the C. g. scalaris Cope: 

1. Six longitudinal narrow stripes with unspotted interspaces.. C. g. gularis (young). 

2. Six stripes as above, tbe dark interspaces with small white spots. . C. g. gularis vcrus. 

3. Six stripes as above, wider and very obscure ; small obscure spots, 

C. g. gularis ohsoJetiis. 

4. Six stripes as above, but wider, and the spots enlarged so as to be continent occa- 

sionally with the light stripes 

"Of the above forms all are numerously represented in the collec- 
tion. The modiflcation of the color pattern described is not entirely 
due to age, as some of the largest specimens belong to Nos. 2 and 3. 
Nevertheless small specimens predominate in the No. 1, and No. 4 pre- 
sents a good many small specimens." The specimens enumerated are 
as follows : ^ 

Subspecies No. 1; Cat. Nos. 14,236-41-49-69; 14,305. 
Subspecies No. 2; Cat. Nos. 14,231-41,305-308. 
Subspecies No. 3; Cat. Nos. 14,231-50-308. 
Subspecies No. 4; Cat. Nos. 14,241-50-302-5. 

These forms are not sexual, as several of them include both sexes. 

Not having been fully persuaded of the distinction between the 
C. fessellatus and C. sexUneaius series, I used the name G. s. tigris for a 
''Sixth subspecies" of the above table. The name was, however, mis- 
applied, although the color pattern is identical with that of the C. tes- 
sellatus tigris Baird and Girard, with the exception that there are 
traces of six stripes instead of only four. The smaller specimens

referred to, the C. s. sexlineatus, difler from that subspecies in baviug 
well -developed postantebrachial scales. 

Tlie gradation in the color characters given is complete, so that no 
subdivision into subspecies can be made. The case is exactly i)arallel 
with that of C. tessellatus tessellatus, except that there are here no indi- 
viduals with the stripes entirely obliterated and complete transverse 
stripes posteriorly. (Such specimens are the C. (j. scalaru ; see below.) 
The femoral pores are generally eighteen, but some have sixteen, sev- 
enteen, and twenty. In eleven of the specimens now before me seven 
have five infralabials and four have six. These numbers do not coin- 
cide with the color types. 

Like other members of this genus this subspecies is extremely active 
in life. They are not easily caught by a single person, and I have spent 
considerable time in endeavoring to get near them on tlie staked i^lains 
of Texas, They play hide and seek for a time, and then take refuge in 
the hole of some fossorial mammal.

long; frenoocular plate generally wanting. Brachial scales small, in 
eight rows; antebrachials in three; postantebrachials in two or three 
rows. Femorals in eight rows. The three large anal plates are bounded 
by several small plates laterally and in front. Femoral pores nineteen ; 
in one eighteen, and in one seventeen. Longest toe of extended pos- 
terior leg reaching to front of auricular meatus. First and fifth toes 
measuring opposite to each other. 

Ground color pale, on the sides jiosteriorly light rosy orange. The 
dark color only remains as narrow transverse black stripes which do not 
cross the middle line, which is occupied by a longitudinal series of spots. 
This is due to the fact that in the adults the black ground is completely 
broken up by the transverse extensions of the light stripes, which are 
quite traceable in the young. In some specimens the black spots do 
not fuse on the sides into transverse stripes (Cat, No. 14302). All the 
dark markings fade out on the limbs and sacral region, leaving a gray 
ground (in alcohol) which is marked with rosy orange spots. The lat- 
eral ventral plates and all tliose of the thorax with the posterior or 
concealed face of the anterior leg, are black or blackish in the adult.

ornamental of the genus. It is well distinguished from the C. grahamii 
in color characters, as well as iu the presence of the well-developed 
postantebrachial scales. In the C. gularis it corresponds exactly in

has the light spots much less numerous, especially on the legs, and they 
are never continent into transverse bars. The femoral pores are more

Scales of tbe collar moderate, subequal, in four or five rows; mar- 
ginal scales equal to the others. Mesoptychial scales considerably 
smaller than the gular scales, which are large, aud extend from one 
ramus to the other. Scales of the back rounded, not i)rominent, small, 
measuring .33 mm. Supraorbital plates wider than long, except the 
anterior, and not separated from the frontaparietals by scales. Inter-

parietal large, not twice as long as wide; parietals sub triangular, as 
wide as the interparietals, but much shorter. Frontoparietals remark- 
able for tlieir small size and from their terminating each in an angle 
anteriorly, which receive between them the posterior apex of the frontal. 
They are smaller than the parietals, which are smaller than in other 
species. Infralabial plates six on each side, the last one small; the 
first pair separated at the posterior angle. Brachial scales in six rows ; 
antebrachials in four. Femorals in seven, tibials in three rows. 
Femoral pores 21. The hind limb extended reaches to the posterior 
border of the orbit. 

Measurements.— Size, medium. Length of head and body (tail in- 
jured), 81 mm.; length to angle of mandible, 22 mm.; to edge of collar, 
26 mm.; to axilla, 31 mm.; of fore limb, 26 mm,; of fore foot, 14 mm.; 
of hind leg, 60 mm. ; of hind foot, 32 mm. 

Ground color above anteriorly black, posteriorly olive. This is 
marked by six narrow lines of a paler olive, which represent the lines 
of the C. sexlineatus, with an additional median dorsal one. These 
fade out or become very indistinct on the lumbar and sacral regions. 
The interspaces, black anteriorly, are marked at first by small olive 
spots, but these enlarging, break up the black ground into spots, but 
these fade out on the middle of the length. The superior surfaces of 
the limbs and tail are olive, the latter unspotted; the hind limbs 
faintly spotted with paler above and posteriorly, and the forearm retic- 
ulated with black posteriorly. The dorsal stripes, except the three 
median, extend as far as the orbit. Eest of head olivaceous. Lower 
surface of body bluish olivaceous. Lower surface of head, limbs, and 
tail, yellow; the first named with a bluish transverse patch across the 
gular region. 

This subspecies has various peculiarities. It differs from the other 
members of the C. sexlineatus series iu the larger numbers and more 
equal size of the scales of the gular fold, approaching in this way the 
C. tessellatus, but not agreeing with it, since the marginal scales are not 
smaller. It differs from all the species in the small size of the interpari- 
etal and i)arietal plates. Its posterior legs are longer than in any species 
except the G. variolosus. No species has four rows (or three at the 
narrowest part) of antebrachial scales; the usual number being two to 
three ; and the femorals are more numerous than in the C. g. gular is. The 
coloration is also quite distinctive. But one specimen is known, and 
that is from southwestern Texas. The discovery of other specimens 
will determine whether this is or is not a true species. In the obsoles- 
cence of the color pattern posteriorly it resembles the C. g. semi/asciatus, 
which follows.

three large ones with eight to ten smaller ones on the sides and in front. 
The hind leg a little short, the longest toe when extended not reaching 
the meatns auditorius by the diameter of the latter. 

Measurements. — Total length, 300 mm. ; length to angle of mandible, 
25 mm.; length to collar, 32 mm; leugth to axilla, 42 mm.; length to 
vent, 100 mm. ; length of fore limb, 30 mm. ; length of fore foot, 13 mm. ; 
length of hind leg, 64 mm. ; of hind foot, 35 mm. 

The color is uniform olivaceous above and below, with the following- 
black marks: There are three rows of black spots on each side of the 
middle line above; the superior small, subquadrate, the second larger 
and transverse, the inferior forming short crossbars. The superior row 
extends from the interscapular region to the middle of the leugth of the 
back; the second row extends further, and the inferior row extends 
nearly to the groin. Limbs, head, belly, and tail unspotted. 

But two specimens are known to me. In Cat. No. 3033 the black spots 
are smaller and are restricted to the anterior fourth of the length of 
the body, being most distinct in front of the scapular region. Here 
traces of the original six stripes are visible between the spots. 

This form has various peculiarities which entitle it to be regarded as 
a subspecies, and possibly as a species. 

It is possible that it may be demonstrated that C. sericeus is estab- 
lished on a female of this species with abnormally reduced frontoparie- 
tal plates. The coloration is much like that of specimen Cat. No. 3033,

ciliares; a freuo-orbital ; two fronto-parietals; scales on middle of eyelid slightly 
enlarged, hexagonal; nasal in contact with second upjier labial, postnasal and 
second upper labial being separated; posterior gular scales small, abruptly sepa- 
rated from the anterior, the line of demarkation between them being emphasized 
by the two rows nearest the latter being markedly smaller than the rest of the 
posterior ones; plates of the collar rather large, in several rows, the marginal larg- 
est; dorsal granules smooth, rather large; ventral plates in eight longitudinal and 
thirty-one transverse rows. Two large preanals, wider tlian high, the posterior

continuous with bnichials, in two rows, the outer one hardly larger; granules along 
posterior edge of under side ol' forearm but slightly enlarged. Five rows of femorals, 
outer largest; tibials in three rows, outer largest. Ui)per and lateral caudal scales 
slightly oblifiue, rather strongly keeled, and pointed posteriorly. Color above dark 
brown, with six longitudinal light lines and a median clay-colored band of the same 
shade as the top of the head; two light longitudinal lines on fore limbs and three 
on hind limbs; under side whitish, more or less suffused with bluish, especially ou 
the flanks. 

For dimensions, see table below. 

In addition to the type, there arcs four other specimens which agree with it in all 
essential points; two of them have thirteen femoral i)ore8, while two have only 
twelve; two have thirty-three rows of veutrals, one has thirty-one, and one thirty; 
three have three antebrachial rows, and in these the outer is by far the largest ; two 
have only four femoral rows. lu other respects the specimens are nearly identical.

G12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

He also adds the following remarks: 

Of all our North American Cuemidopbori this seems to be the most distinct species, 
Cnemidophorus ( Vcrtkaria) luipenjthriis not even excepted. As will be seen from im 
enumeration of the characters by which it differs from them all, viz: The peculiar 
relations of the nasals and anterior labials, the arrangement of the preanals, the 
low number of femoral pores, twelve to thirteen, brachials in three subequal rows, 
femorals in only four to five rows. Of these the first-mentioned character seems 
even to be unique in the genus, as I have seen no mention of it in the descriptions 
of extralimital species, and after a careful examination of about three hundred 
specimens of the various North American forms, I can find no approach to the con- 
dition which is 80 characteristic of the present species, in all five specimens of 
which it is equally well pronounced. The low number of femoral pores is also well 
worth noting, inasmuch as it entirely destroys the usefulness of one of the sections 
of Boulenger's key to the species (Cat. Liz. Brit. Mus., II, pp. 360 and 361), relied upon 
to separate the South American species, C. occUifer and niultiUneatus, from the other 
species with eight longitudinal rows of ventral plates and the nostrils ojiening in 
the nasal. The fusion of the two posterior preanals into one wide transversal plate 
seems to be another good character. It is true that this state of affairs is occasion- 
ally seen in specimens of C. sexUneatus or its numerous subspecies, but the occur- 
rence is rare, hardly reaching 2 per cent in the enormous series examined by me, 
while in the Cerros Island species it is normal, since found equally well represented 
in all live specimens.

Dentition strictly pleurodont, the teeth hollow at the base; lateral teeth 
bicuspid or tricuspid; pterygoids frequently toothed. Premaxillary 
bone single; nasal and frontal double; parietal single; postorbital and

ijuxtaposed or imbricate, usually smaller tliau the veutrals, which form 
longitudinal and transverse series. (Bouleuger.) 

I have only had opportunity to examine the visceral anatomy of the 
genera Tachi/droDtiis, Laccrta, and EremidH. These possess a urinary 
bladder and a corpus adiposum, which projects freely into the abdomi- 
nal cavity. The alimentary canal displays no colon. The liver is not 
elongate, and exhibits a small middle (third) lobe of the posterior 
border. Its right lobe exhibits a recurved lobe from its extremity, 
which points posteriorly next the body wall. The mesenteries are of 
the usual or normal type of the order. 

They inhabit Europe, Asia, and Africa; are absent from Madagascar, 
and most abundantly represented in Africa, with but few in the East 
Indies. 

1 have examined the hemipenis in the genera Lacerta, AcantJw- 
iJactylKSj and Laiastia. They are bifurcate or bilobate. Vn each divi- 
sion and proximad to it is an oval area with transverse laminre and 
surrou)ided by a welt. In Aeanthodactyhis one of the areas is marked 
by longitudinal folds.

Boulenger describes this family as follows : 

Tongue moderately elongate, bifid posteriorly, free and very feebly nicked ante- 
riorly, covered with inbricate scales like papilhe or oblique plic:e converging 
anteriorly towards the median line. Dentition pleurodont; teeth closely set, with 
long cylindrical shafts, hollow at the base, with conical or bicuspid crowns. Ptery- 
goid teeth often present. Skull in every respect similar to that of the Lacertidre, 
with dermal ossification roofing over the supratemporal fossje. Limbs well developed 
or rudimentary. Clavicle dilated and loof-shaped proximally; interclavicle cruci- 
form. Tail Jong and fragile. Head with symmetrical shields. Body with squarish 
or rhomboidal imbricate scales, which often form regular longitudinal and trans- 
verse series; it is besides protected by osteodermal plates, underlying the scales, 
which show a system of longitudinal tubules intersecting a transverse one, as in the 
Scincidw; this structure iisually more distinct on the ventral plates than on the 
thicker and rougher dorsal ones. A lateral fold with granular scales, similar to that 
of Gerrhonotus, is present in all genera except Tracheloptyclius, which in its scaling 
more resembles the Seines. 

Femoral pores constantly present. Eyelids well developed. Tym- 
panum distinct. 

In tlie liemipenis in Gerrhosaurus nigroUneatus, there are on the distal 
third, three welts opposite the sulcus, the median larger, all finely 
cross folded. Between one of these and the sulcus is a tract of coarse 
papilla"; between the other and the sulcus the surface is smooth. 

This family is exactly intermediate between the Lacertidce (single 
premaxillary, femoral pores) and the Scincidcv (presence and structure 
of the dermal bony idates). It is strictly African, its headquarters 
being South Africa and Madagascar, and extending northward to the 
southern limit of Sahara.

Boulenger's description is as follows: 

Tongue moderately long, free and feebly nicked in front, covered with imbricate 
scale-like papillte. Dentition pleurodont, teeth conical, bicuspid, or with spheroidal 
or compressed crowns; the now teeth hollow out the base of the old ones. Pterygoid 
teeth may be present. 

Prtemaxilliary bones two, sometimes ineompletelj' separated; nasal double; fron- 
tal single or double; parietal single; postorbital and postfrontotemporal arches 
complete, osseous; interorbital septurn and columella cranii well developed; infra- 
orbital fossa present, bounded by the maxillary, the transverse bone, the palatine, 
and often also by the pterygoid. Skull with bony dermal ])lates overroofiug the 
suprateniporal fossa. 

Limbs present or absent ; pectoral and pelvic arches constantly present. Clavicle 
dilated and usually perforated proximally, interclavicle cruciform. Ossified abdom- 
inal ribs are absent. 

Body protected by bony plates underlying the scales, which are cycloid- 
hexagonal, rarely rhomboidal, imbricate, arranged quincuncially. These plates 
provided with symmetrical tubules, which usually consist of a transverse one anas- 
tomosing with several longitudinal ones. Head covered with aymmetrical shields; 
an azygos occipital is rarely present. Pupil round. Eyelids well developed. No 
femoral pores. 

Scincoids are cosmopolitan, the bulk occurring in Australia, the islands of the 
Pacific, the East Indies, and Africa; they are comparatively very poorly represented 
in South America. As far as wo know at present, all species are ovoviviparous. 
Adaptations to every mode of life, save aquatic and aerial occur. 

This family presents considerable variety in the details of the strnc- 
ture of the viscera. In such genera without interuasal plates as I have

bad opportimity to dissect, 1 have found no corpus adiposum, while this 
structure is well developed on the forms with suprauasal plates. In 
serpeiitiforin types, here as in the Anguidie, the liver is situated more 
posterior to the heart, being- separated from it by an interspace, which 
is not present in the strictly lacertiform types. I have only found a 
colon in three types, the Australian Egernia major, a pea green lAole- 
pisma from some part of the Australian realm, and a GhalcuJcs lineafufi 
from Morocco. The Trdchysaurus rur/osus of Australia is remarkable 
for the shortness and large diameter of its alimentary canal, the diame- 
ter being similar all the way through, and the course being a simple sig- 
moid. In all other genera there is a small intestine distinct from the 
stomach and rectum, which is more or less plicated in its course. 

The characteristics which I have observed may be tabulated as 
follows: 

I. No corpus adiposum. 

A, No small iiiteHtine; liver tliree-lobed. 

Middle lobe of liver superior to the others and produced into a long strip. 

Tracliysanriis. 
AA. A plicate small intestine. 
a. No colon. 

Liver adjacent to heart, two-lobed, right h)be little produced.

Liver moderately posterior to heart; three-lobed, the right lobe pro- 
duced Liolepisma {laferah). 

Liver well posterior to heart; liver two-lobed; right lobe produced; 

small intestine short, with only one fold of sigmoid Siaphos.^ 

aa. A colon (short and wide). 

Liver adjacent to heart, two-lobed ])osteriorly, right much prolonged. 

Liolepisma (green sp.), KgcrniaJ' 

II. Corpus adiposum pros^'ut, adherent to body wall. 
A. A plicated small intestine. 

a. A colon. 

Ashortciccum; liver well posterior to heart, the right lobe much larger 
than the left ; right lung longer than left Cltalcides.*^ 

III. Corpus adiposum free from the bodj^ wall. 

A. A plicated small intestine; no colon ; liver two-lobed posteriorly. 

Lungs ecpial ; right lobe of liver moderate; small intestine sinuous. .EumecesJ 

Lungs equal ; small intestine large and little sinuous Euprepcs.* 

Left lung or both lungs short ; small intestine contracted and short . . Mahuia.^ 
The genera without corpus adiposum are inhabitants of the Austral- 
ian zoological reabn, excepting the Central American Mocoa assata, and 
the North and Central American Liolepisma laterale.

CKOCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 617 

I have examined the heiiii penis in Tradtysdiinis, Lcpidothyris {fer- 
nandi), Enprepes (carinatus), Eumeces and Mahuia. Tliey are smooth 
and with more or less numerous longitudinal folds, excepting in Trachji- 
saunis. Here the laminae diverge from the suleus proxiniad and turn 
to a horizontal direction, meeting opposite the sulcus in a chevron 
directed distad. In Euprepis carinafKN and Eumeces obsoletits some of 
the plic.e are cross ribbed. In Lepidothi/yis fernandi the organ is 
shortly bifurcate, and each division has a membranous welt next the 
adjacent division. 

1 have examined the arches and limbs of the Chalcides lineatus with 
the following results:' 

Scapular and pelvic arches present. Limbs of both pairs present, 
very short, with digits 3-3. 

Scapular arch. — All the elements present, and presenting the true 
characters of the Leptoglossa, namely, clavicles distally dilated and per- 
forate, and interclavicle cruciform. The scapula and coracoid are fused 
and osseous. The coracoid cartilage incloses a coracoid foramen, and 
coraco precoracuid foramen with the cartilaginous precoracoid. Supra- 
scapula large, cartilaginous. Sternum well developed, with cartilagi- 
nous borders, no foramen, and four costal articulations. 

Feh'ic arch. — All tlie elements present, but slender; the inferior 
arches directed anteriorly; the pubes in contact distally. The ischia 
are separated by a narrow membrane, which extends forward to the 
pubic symphysis. The ilium stands nearly vertical, its inferior portion 
articulating with the distally fused extremities of the diapophyses of 
two vertebrte. Except in the slenderness of its parts, the pelvis is like 
that of Scincida^ with well developed limbs. 

Fiirbringer represents only three sternocostal articulations in the 
C. tridactylxs. 

The food of the species of Scincida^ is principally insects. One 
exception to this is a i)ea-green species of Liolepisnia from Australasia 
from whose alimentary canal I took some seeds resembling cherry 
stones. 

The Evesia monodacti/Ia Gray, from Ceylon, which is allied to Acontias, 
I found to present the following characters of the arches and limbs: 

Scapular and i)elvic arches present. Anterior and i>osterior limbs 
present, external, very rndimental, and undivided. 

Scapular arch. — All tlie elements i)rescnt. Sternum cartilaginous, 
with two costals; chivicles osseous, i)r()ximally simple. Interclavicle 
a simple, longitudinal, bony splint. Scapula and coracoid distinct; 
oidy ossified on their posterior borders. Coracoid and precoracoid 
cartilages not distinct, nor inclosing any fontanelles. Anterior limb 
consisting of a humerus with a minute cubital segment. 

Pelric arch. — Elements ])resent subequal; the inferior directed for- 
ward, meeting on the middle line, without longitudinal connection. 



Journal of Morphology, 1892, p. 236. 



618 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Ilium directed slightly forward and upward, and articulating by its 
proximal extremity with the fused distal extremities of the diapo- 
physes of two vertebra?. Posterior limb exactly like the anterior, that 
is, consisting of a proximal element (femur) and a distal rudimental 
segment. 

Fiirbringer' describes and figures the shoulder and pelvic girdles 
of Acontias meleagris and A. plumbeus. The shoulder girdles consist 
of simple elements supposed to represent scapula?, fused or not on 
the middle line, the median portion of which, in the A. plumheus, it 
is suggested, may be clavicles. The pelvic girdles consist, in both 
species, of a simple element on each side, consisting of ilium (joined 
to vertebra?) and supposed pubis. My examination of Evesia shows 
the impropriety of combining that genus with Acontias^ as has been 
done by Boulenger. 

As in other families, in the serpentiform types the liver and stomach 
occupy a position caudad to the lungs, and so the latter do not appear 
in the mesenteric connections of the former; as, for instance, Siajyhos. 
The mesenteries are the usual ones, but one peculiarity is very fre- 
quent, though not universal in the family. The hepatoventral sheet is 
generally divided into two, a right and a left sheet, next the liver, 
forming a pocket, which opens caudad. In the Tiliqua scincoides the 
two sheets only unite at the cephalic end of the liver, remaining sepa- 
rate throughout. 

Dr. Boulenger remarks as to this family: 

I have met with great difficulty in arranging the genera of this family. The 
majority of the characters hitherto employed for the distinction of genera, such as 
the degree of development of the limbs, the jiresence or absence of a transparent 
disc in the lower eyelid, the presence or absence of keels on scales, etc., are in many 
cases not even of specific value. I have therefore used certain characters which 
hitherto have been neglected, but which, I am convinced, afford a firmer basis for a 
natural arrangement. The artificial nature of an arrangement based on the degree 
of the development of the liml)8 has been pointed out by others. In a family like 
the Scincoids, in which the limbs are undergoing a process of abortion, this charac- 
ter must be abandoned as one expressing relationship bj^ itself. And I trust that 
the arrangement of the species in one or more series within a genus, passing from 
forms with well developed pentadactyle limbs and lacertiform physiognomy to such 
as have rudimentary limbs, or even none at all, marks a great improvement upon 
the artificial classifications in use down to the present day. 

I am not prepared to admit that the above remarks of Dr. Boulenger 
have more than au application to the cases where the development of 
the limbs and digits is irregular in the same species. This has not 
been shown to be the case more frequently than we expected to find in 
all other zoological characters, and particularly those which we call 
generic. It is indeed precisely the grades of characters expressed by 
the last structural modification of parts that the generic nomenclature 
is created to record. So long as the characters are constant then it is 
necessary to designate them by generic terms, and I have therefore

Nostril pierced iu the nasal plate. Palatine bones in contact on the 
median line of the palate. Tympanum not covered with integument. 
Pterygoid bones in contact on the middle line. Eyelids movable; 
digits with nouretractile claws. Supranasal plates wanting. Lower 
eyelid with a transparent disk; two frontoparietal plates; digits 5-5. 

This genus embraces twenty-eight species, all of which are referred 
to Lygosoma, Section IV, iu Bouleuger's Catalogue of the Lizards in 
the British Museum. Of these, five are from New Zealand ; five are 
from Australia and adjacent islands; four are from the Pacific islands 
and New Guinea; three are from the Philippines; six are from India; 
one from the Mauritius; two from West Africa; and one, the species 
described below, is from North America, and, according to Boulenger, 
from China. South America and (excepting China) the temperate parts 
of Asia and Europe are not. possessed of any species of Liolepisma. 

The genus is markedly diflferent from Eumeces in the absence of 
internasals, the frontal coming broadly in contact with the rostral as 
well as the nasals. The palate has a triangular notch running to a 
point instead of being more linear and hollowed anteriorly. There are 
no pterygoid teeth as in Eumeces. The tongue appears flatter and 
more extensible at the tip.

body. The hind legs applied twice forward reach halfway between 
arm aud ear; contained three times in head and body. Fifth hind toe 
shorter than second. Free portion of longest toe half the head. 

Upper iVciTts of head aud body uniform reddish olive, sometimes 
bronzed or greenish for a width of about six rows ol" scales. This on 
the edges changes indistinctly to a light Hue, which appears to be ou 
the adjacent edges of two rows of scales. Immediately below this is a 
blackish lateral stripe from the nose and through the eye about If 
scales wide, with or without a white line below it, and below the sides 
are striped alternately with dusky and lighter. Under parts yellowish 
white with faint lines along the adjacent edge 
of scales. Tail sometimes greenish or pale livid 
beneath. 

The color varies above to a considerable extent, 
and sometimes (including the top of head) is 
irregularly spotted with blackish. The upper 
lateral dusky stripe is well defined above, some- 
times very faint below. The alternating dark 
and light lines are sometimes quite uniform 
dusky or dusky, dotted with lighter by the break- 
ing up of the light lines. The scales beneath ^'?- ^-^■

scales sometimes quite distinct. Sometimes cat. xo. 4971, u.s.n.m. 

there are faint traces of light Ihies along the 

centers of the dorsal rows of scales. There may generally be detected 
two light lines below the dark lateral baud 1 to If scales apart, after which 
each row of scales is light along the center and finely mottled externally. 

The lower edge of the larger lateral dusky stripe is frequently efl'aced. 
The dark spots on the dorsal surface sometimes exhibit a tendency to 
linear arrangement in two series. 

I can not distinguish Texas specimens from more Eastern ones, though 
it is possible that, if the outlines of the scales and plates were more 
distinct, characteristic features might be found. The lateral black 
stripes are perhaps better defined aud the arrangement of the dorsal 
dark specks into ten series more marke<l. 

Cat. No. 3152, from Arkansas, collected by I)r. Woodhouse, difiers in 
having the broad dorsal band divided into three, a central darker cover- 
ing four rows of scales and two lateral lighter two-thirds as wide. The 
central strii)e is darker externally and rather more so along the center, 
and may almost be considered as formed of lines, or three lines, the 
breaking of which may l)e considered as producing the dots found in 
some specimens, and as illustrating the primary pattern of coloration 
(two dark lines along the middle of the back, two rows of scales apart). 

This species ranges over the Austroriparian region, extending into 
the Carohnian district of the Eastern as far as liurlington County, Xew

Nostril pierced iti the nasal plate. Palatine and pterygoid bones 
separated on the median line of the palate, the latter with teeth. Supra- 
nasal plates i)resent. Limbs pentadactyle, the digits not denticu- 
lated laterally. 

The preceding characters define a natural genus. The following are 
also common to the species: The nostrils are lateral. The postnasals 
vary. There are either one or two; if the latter, one may be directly 
above the other, or the second may be both behind and above the first. 
The head is covered with ossified plates concealing the muscles and 
with an external epidermis. The tongue is thick, elongate, cordate or 
arrow shaped, slightly notched anteriorly, and quite homogeneously 
squamous throughout. The flap covering the anus is margined behind 
by two large plates, with smaller ones on either side. 

Osteology. — For the determination of the skeletal characters of this 
genus I have skeletons of the i^\ obsoletus and U. quinquelineatus from 
the national collection. 

The premaxillary is split as in other Sciucidfe, and the halves are in 
the closest contact. The common spine is rather elongate, while the 
palatal suture is simply emarginate. The nasals are not shortened, and 
are distinct. The frontal is double, and is simply grooved on the mid- 
dle line below. The parietal is single, and is i)ierced by the pineal 
foramen at about its middle. The parietoquadrate arch is well elevated. 
The supraoccipital is loosely articulated, presenting a truncate median 
process toward, but not to, a median notch of the i^arietal. Exoccip- 
tals distinct by suture. Prefrontal rather large, not sending poste- 
riorly a supercilliaiy process, and not produced far above the orbit. 
Lachrymal small; not, or very little, visible on external facial surface, 
and reached by a long internal process of the jugal. External surface 
of jugal separated widely from prefrontal, its i)ostorbital portion much 
longer, slender, and rising to meet the postfrontal. The latter is large 
and unequally V-shaped, the posterior limb broad and covering the tem- 
poral fossa between the parietal and supratemporal bones, with more 
or less of a fissure next the parietal posteriorly. Postfrontal a si)lint 
separating the jugal and supratemporal from the postfrontal. Supra- 
temporal well produced anteriorly, and in contact with the parieto- 
qiuKlrate arch for tlie posterior two-thirds the length of the latter. 
Quadrate with one, a deep external, conch. The vomers are elongate, 
and also expanded laterally, passing above the prominent palatine 
lamina' of the maxillary, bones. They are in close apposition on the 
median line, but are so swollen longitudinally as to leave a groove at 
the common suture. The longitudinal ribs terminate in a pair of 
appressed hooks, which look downward and backward at the posterior 
extremities of the bones. The vomerine branch of the palatine is not

quite as long as the maxillary braucli, and is on a superior plane, being 
in close contact with its mate on the middle line, and forming with the 
maxillarj^ plate a half tube opening inward. Pterygoids not very 
wide, gradually narrowing to the posterior rod, which is oi)enly grooved 
on the inner side. The basipterygoid processes overlap the entire width 
of the internal face. Ectopterygoid reaching maxillary and jugal, but 
not i^alatine; little deflected posteriorly. Presphenoid not ossified; 
sphenoid distinguished from basioccipital by suture. Latter with sub- 
conic descending lateral processes, which inclose a deep fossa on the 
external side. Postoptic small, simple, crescentic. Petrosal extended 
well in advance of semicircular canal above; subforaminal portion still 
more produced, bounding a down looking open groove. Parietal send- 
ing downward a rather elongate process in front of petrosal. Ej)ij)tery- 
goid originating opposite basipterygoid below, and resting above on 
the descending process of the parietal and the anterior margin of the 
petrosal. Occipital condyle tripartite. 

Meckel's cartilage exposed from the anteriorly placed splenial 
foramen. Coronoid a little produced anteriorly on external face of 
ramus, not at all posteriorly. Surangular and articular distinct; angle 
flat, rounded, not produced or angular inward. Dentary produced as 
far posteriorly as coronoid; si)lenial rather elongate (forming the 
inferior border of Meckel's groove in E. ohsoletus). 

]n the hyoid system, U. quinquelineatus j)reseuts a short second cerato- 
branchial. The first ceratobranchial has a cartihiginous terminal seg- 
ment, as has also the ceratohyal. The latter is of moderate length, is 
without expansions, and is articulated with the extremity of the rather 
short hypobranchial. There is a large free epibranchial, which com- 
mences near the free extremity of the second ceratobranchial, and curv- 
ing backward, outward and then forward, terminates nearly opposite 
the middle of the ceratohyal. 

The cervical intercentra in the U. ohsoletus number four, and those of 
the U. qiiinqtielinetus three, posterior to that of the atlas. There is no 
zygosphene. The caudal diapophyses are well developed at the base 
of the series, and are split lengthwise at the middle and distal part 
of the series by the segmentation of the vertebrte. Neural spine 
single at posterior extremity of neural arch. 

The suprascapula is expanded anteroposteriorly, and the scapula is 
rather elongate. The latter has no proscapula, while the coronoid has 
one emarginatiou. The sternum has a small fontanelle jjosteriorly 
placed. There are three costal articulations and a xiphoid rod with two 
ribs. The latter is in close apposition to its mate, and is expanded 
outward at the junction of the first hfemapophysis. 

The ilium has no angulns cristw, and the acetabulum is entire. The 
pubes converge at a subacute angle, and the small pectineal process is 
nearer the proximal extremity, and is turned downward. The ischia 
are subtransverse, and i)reseut a wide emarginatiou posteriorly, since 
the processus tuherosus is near the acetabulum. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 627 

Besides the family characters, this geuus is well distinguished among 
American lizards by the divided frontal; the overrooting the temporal 
fossa by the postfrontal and supratemporal; the descending process of 
the j>arietal; forms of the xiphoid rods, and forms of the pelvic bones. 

In the latest enumeration of the species of this genus, that of 
Boulenger, thirty-one species are included. These are distributed as 
follows : 

North America 16 

Mexico 6 

Paleaarctic Region (North Africa) 1 

Paleaarctic Region (Asia) 7 

Southwest Asia. 1 

Total 31 

For purposes of analysis, the North American species may be 
arranged in four groups, which have the following characters: 

A postnasal and one mental plate I 

A postnasal and two mental plates II 

No jjostnasal and two mental plates Ill 

No jjostuasal and one mental plate IV 

It may be also stated here that all the species have four supraorbital 
plates except E. egregius, which has but three. Also that U. longirostris 
ha^ more numerous scales than any other species, as they are in 30-34 
rows: while in U. egregius the number of scale rows is smaller than in 
any species, reaching only twenty-two. 

The form of the jjostnasal plate presents considerable variation in 
some species. This is especially the case in E. muUivirg((tns, where it 
may or may not reach the supranasal, and is sometimes directly under 
the prefrenal. The opposite sides are sometimes slightly different. In 
some species with two mentals they may be sometimes abnormally 
fused together. 

All the North American skinks lose these distinctive marks of color 
with age. All are dark, nearly black, when young, varied with white 
lines or spots, which leave a trace of their presence when old. Three 
of the labials, the upper especially, are black, with white centers. 
There is always retained a dusky border to the lateral edges. If the 
edge of the upper Jaw be white the character is never lost, the labials 
never having darker lateral borders. The light lines in increasing age 
generally remain for a time and are bordered by blackish or dark 
brown, the interspaces generally becoming light olive. Even these, 
however, gradually disappear, and the scales generally are olivaceous 
above, with dusky borders, especially where origiiudly dark colored. 

The following arrangement may be considered as defining the species 
with two une(iual postnasals by the color of the young: 

A. Upper labials plain whitish; ground color black above, bluish beneath; beneath 
head white. 
1. Five white lines, all on adjacent edges of scales, the middle bifurcating on the 
head //_ quinqiielineultis. 



628 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

2. Four wliito lines, the upper on either side on adjacent edges of scales and 
8ei)arated by two rows E. skilioniainifi. 

o. Five white lines, the two lateral along the centers of single rows. Median Hue 

not bifurcating antei'iorly E. Jeptoyram nms. 

B. Upper labials sjiotted with white; not continuously of this color. General color 
black. 

4. Five very obsolete whitish lines, the upper lateral on adjacent edges of two 
rows, separated by six rows. A faint continuous line on the side of head 
above. Tip and sides of chin plain whitish. Spots on labials not closed 
beueath. Sides of neck scarcely spotted E. ohsoletaa. 

5. No whitish lines whatever. Labials and plates on side of head, beneath, and 
above all black, with a rounded central spot of white. Two short lines of 
white spots on each sid ■ of the neck E. (juttulatus.

inferior temporals, tlie anterior small, the posterior larger than the 
eighth upper labial. Interoccipital large, rounded posteriorly, very 
acute anteriorly. Frontoparietal plates geminiform, in contact by 
their inner angles. Supraoculars four; anterior supraocular small, 
barely or not in contact with the frontonasal. Inferior ])ali'ebra gran-

not separated by a postmental. Three slightly prominent granules 
upon the superior part of anterior auricular border. Digits compressed; 
of the posterior the fourth has twice the extent of the fifth. Sole tuber- 
culous externally and internally; medially granular; palm tuberculous 
posteriorly. Scales small, especially upon the sides; rows from thirty- 
nine to forty two. Preanal plates, four; the median very large, the 
exterior very small. Total length, 162 mm.; tail, 95 mm. 

Color above, from rusty to ashy brown, paler on the tail. A white 
line begins at the anterior angle of the orbit, and extending above 
the latter reaches as far as the crural region. It is margined with 
black superiorly, and separated from that of the opposite side by eight 
rows of scales. Beneath it the sides are black or brownish for a width 
of three and a half scales, beneath which shade is another white line 
extending from beneath the orbit to the groin. The dark color of the 
sides extends upon the tail for one third its length. Tlie under surface 
of this member, of the extremities and belly, greenish blue; throat and 
chin yellowish. In younger specimens a light line upon each canthus 
rostralis is analagous to those which unite and form the median dorsal 
band in U. quinqueUneafus. There are nearly ten more rows of scales 
in this species than in U. quinquelineatus, and there is only one mental. 
The latter species has six preanal plates, of which the median pair is 
not so disproportionately large; also the freuals and nasofrenal are 
narrow and erect. 

We are informed by Mr. J. M. Jones, in his Naturalist in Bermuda, 
that a species of "Scincus" inhabits the islands, and that it is the only 
indigenous true reptile. He notices its resemblance to U. quinqueline- 
atus {'■'■ S.fasciatus'''') of the United States, and gives a description of an 
old male specimen.

Plates of head as iii JFJ. sMltonianus. The dorsal scales of equal 
width, or the ventral not larger. Dorsal scales 28 to 34, and about 55 
from head to tail. Tail one and one-fourth or one and one-half tiiuGS 
the body wlien perfect. Fore leg from elbow longer than head to ear, 
which is contained about four or four and one-half times in head and 
body. Hind legs, applied twice forward, reach to or a little beyond 
the ear; contained two and one-half times or less in from knee, three to 
three and one half times in head and body. Free portion of long hind 
toe nearly three fourths the side of head to ear; the fifth toe decidedly 
longer than the second. 

Coloration. 1. Black above, including the head, with five equidistant 
narrow whitish stripes, a dorsal and two lateral; the median bifurcat- 
ing at the occiput, the branches uniting at the rostrum. Each line 
usually on adjacent edges of the rows of scales (occupying half or 
third) and separated by one, sometimes two, rows of the ground color 
("/«sdatMs"). 

2. The rest of the scales through which the three middle stripes run, 
black; the intervening scales light olive; the cephalic white line then 
fainter, and next the dorsal, until the whole space between the upper 
lateral stripes is olivaceous, with four dusky lines of dots along the 
middle of scales, head becoming reddish and wider {^^ quinquelineatus^^).

3. Lateral stripes and dusky band becoming obliterated, first the 
upper then tlie lower, the head swelling still more; finally the body 
uniform greenish or reddish olive, whitish beneath, the head as broad 
as long and bright brick red. 

Of these stages the first is confined to very young (less than 50 mm. 
or 62.5 mm.). The red and broad-headed individuals, without distinct 
stripes, of whatever size, are males j the largest, with narrow head and 
distinct stripes, are females. 

More northern specimens do not appear to assume the red head and 
plain coloration. 

In Cat. No. 3129 the plates of the head are much as described in P. 
sMltonianus. The legs are much longer, the hinder applied twice for-

ward reaching a little beyond the eye; from knee contained three timec 
in head and body or reaching halfway from root, two and one- sixth from 
head to between fore legs. Fore leg from elbow one and one-fifth times 
the head to ear, which is contained four and one-half times in head and 
body, which again is contained one and one-half times in the tail. The 
width of head is two-thirds the length to ear. The body at the middle 
is encircled by twenty-eight rows of scales, and there are fifty-six from 
head to tail. 

Other specimens, however, vary considerably from this standard. 
Thus the number of dorsal rows appears to vary up to thirty- four, the 
highest I have yet observed, every intermediate number occurring from 
twenty-eight, the smallest. The longitudinal dorsal number is gener- 
ally fifty-five or fifty-six. With advancing age the head becomes 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 635 

broader behind, until in the ^'laticeps^^ its width is equal to the length 
above, and laterally to the distance from nostril to ear. The unusual 
expansion is chiefly in the cheeks, which are wider from above down- 
ward, and are completely ossified. 

The general color of head and body above is a dark olive green, with 
five nearly or quite equidistant bluish or greenish white stripes, 
one median and two lateral on each side, becoming blue on the tail and 
extending to the tip. The stripes are all of equal width, a little more 
than one-third the width of their intervals, and occupy rather less than 
the adjacent halves of contiguous rows of scales, sometimes only one- 
third. Between each stripe is a row of perfectly plain scales; the 
remainder of the white-streaked 'rows being black. The interval 
between the two lateral white stripes is black; the others are all mar- 
gined by a line of black on the rest of the row of scales as stated, 
leaving on the back two dorsal rows, one on each side the median line, 
dark olive. Beneath the lower white stripe is an obscure dusky 
streak. The under parts are light salmon, tinged with bluish on the 
belly and sides of tail. 

The lowest lateral stripe begins on the upper labials and runs through 
the ear; the upper starts on the canthus rostralis a little in fi'ont of the 
eye. The median bifurcates at the occiput, sending two branches for- 
ward along the edge of the vertical, and uniting in a gentle curve at 
the rostral. ' 

There is a white line down the posterior face of the thigh and another 
on the anterior ftice, both confluent with the lower lateral stripe, and 
becoming more broken on the tibial portion. The fore legs appear 
slightly spotted also. 

In some specimens, as Cat. I^o. 3129&, the white lateral stripes above 
the fore leg run obliquely from one row of scales to another; owe upper 
lateral stripe passes along the middle of the fourth row of scales from 
the median line of back, leaving two olive-colored rows, while its fellow 
on the opposite side is more as described. 

In many, in fact, in most specimens, the light stripe on the anterior 
face of the thigh is wanting. The upper lateral stripe does not always 
bound the exterior of the third row of scales from the middle of the 
back, but is freipiently cimflned to the fourth, especially posteriorly, the 
line sometimes, as already stated, crossing from one row to the other. 
The ground color is sometimes entirely black; the stripes yellowish or 
golden. 

I have in the preceding paragraphs confined my attention to the very 
young specimens usually known as the Eumeces fasciatUKS. With 
increasing age the stripes on the head become obscure and then disap- 
pear entirely, the head assuming more or less of a reddish tinge. The 
cheeks expand and become tinged, especially below and behind, where 
the large plates are ultimately folded into the cavity of the ear and the 
two or three floating triangular scales affixed along its anterior edge 



636 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

are completely concealed or sometimes more or less blunted, contracted, 
or obliterated. With the disappearance of the cephalic stripes the 
median dorsal first becomes obscure; the ground color changes from 
black or narrow dorsal olive stripes to predominant light olivaceous. 
For a considerable time the black on the sides remains distinct and 
continuous, but ultimately is reduced to dusky margins to the scales. 
Sometimes the lateral whitish stripes disaj^pear or are very obsolete, 
the black stripe remaining distinct; or the reverse maybe the case. 
The lateral light lines are, however, quite late to disappear entirely. 
There is often a trace of the original black above in a line of dusky 
dots down the middle of the two dorsal rows of scales, and that of the 
third or fourth row from the central line of the back, formerly continu- 
ous stripes bordering the white. By degrees the lateral stripes become 
more and more obsolete, until there is only the faintest trace or they 
have disappeared entirely, leaving the body of a uniform greenish or 
reddish olive above and a light brick-red head as broad as long. The 
lowest lateral white stripe can usually be detected on oldest specimens 
as well as some of the dusky of the sides ; the scales of the back, how- 
ever, become entirely uniform. 

In Cat. No. 4136 there is a distinct whitish stripe between the legs 
below what is ordinarily the lowest, making three on each side, the dor- 
sal wanting. This is seen more or less distinctly in other specimens, as 
Gat. No. 3178, th6ugh usually wanting. The various changes described 
do not apj)ear to progress uniformly in all specimens. Sometimes a 
series of specimens of the same size will exhibit all the stages, except 
the earliest. 

Professor Baird has shown that the Scincus erythrocephalus, quinque- 
lineatus, and fasciatus are forms of the same species, the first name 
having been given to old males. 

From the preceding remarks it will be seen that I have adopted his 
opinion, combining in one all the three species described by Dr. Hol- 
brook as inhabiting the United States. This I have only done after a 
protracted examination of a large series of specimens from all parts of 
the United States. I have failed to find any constant distinctions in 
the external structure and relative proportions, while the differences 
of coloration are only those readily attributable to age and sex. It is 
well known that the characteristic markings of the skinks are most 
appreciable in the young. Now, in the present case none except the 
very largest have the coloration of erythrocephalus, none except the 
middle and the largest size (females) that of qiiinquelineatus, while every 
one before me with a head and body of less than 2 or 2i inches agrees 
exactly in coloration with the most typical fasciatus. To sum up the 
whole case, I feel very confident that the three (or four, including Dr. 
Hallowell's P. vittigerum?) supposed species in reality constitute but 
one; that the species attains a much larger size in the more Southern 
States than the Northern, there going through all the stages of colora-

tion, and tliat tlie farther north tlie more is this restricted to the pri- 
mary pattern. 

Furthermore, it is probable, or even almost certain, that the females 
retain their stripes and other markings longer than the males, and 
have a much less tendency, if they exhibit it at all, to reddening and 
widening of the head, whicli would explain the difterences in size of 
si)ecimens otherwise similarly colored. It is almost certain that females 
never entirely lose their stripes and never assume the very wide head. 
A series (Cat. No. 4137) of three from Tyree Springs, Tennessee, though 
evidently the same species and of the same size (body and head nearly 
4 inches) represents very fairly the so-called P. erythrocephalus and 
quinqueUneatns^ the former being males, the latter female. As far as 
I have made anatomical examination, all the largest specimens (head 
"and body 4 inches) of those with narrow head and distinct stripes (as 
Cat. No. 4130) are females; all those of same or even less size, with 
very broad, red head and obscure markings (as Cat. No. 4138) are males, 
and T have no doubt this may be taken as a rule in the present case. 

A figure of the details of the female is No. 3. page 177, of this book. 
The specimen is from Florida. 

The most northern, as at the same time the smallest, specimens having 
more the character of P. laticeps or erythrocephaluii tlian that of the 
others, is in bottle Cat. No. 3150, Irom Carlisle. The head and body of 
these barely measure 3 inches, and they were captured by myself in the 
same locality and at the same time with others of the same size agree- 
ing with S. quinquclineatns. The former are males, the latter females, 
as shown by actual examination. 

The Plestiodon vittigerum of Hallowell from Michigan' belongs to the 
middle stage of this species, yar. poJi/f/rammus. In a large nunjber of 
small skinks with median white line before me there is one which, in 
most respects like the small blue skinks, differs in having the fine bluish 
white lines on a black ground very narrow; the hind legs uniform 
black without any stripe. There is a third lateral stripe on each side, 
between the fore and hind legs, less distinct than the other, and a 
short light stripe on each side the median one on the back of the neck. 
This is along the adjacent edges of the first and second row of scales 
from the median line, the inner edge of this first row involved in the 
median stripe. The posterior extremity of the oval light outline on 
the head above, instead of being connected with the end of the dorsal 
stripe as its bifurcation, has the two branches curved outward, as a 
quarter circle, and connecting with the two sui)plementary short cer- 
vical stripes and not at all with the median. The belly is bluish, 
becoming white on the under surface of head; tlie rostral i)late and 
sides of head anterior to the eye are white. 

I do not venture, in the absence of more specimens, to consider this 
as a distinct species; it, however, is markedly different in the character

638 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

of its stripes from any otlier before me. Its locality (Colonels Island, 
off the coast of Georgia, and not on the main land) is to be duly con- 
sidered. 

The Eumeces quinquelineatus is distributed throughout the eastern dis- 
trict, with the exception of the Canadian and Hudsonian subdistricts, 
and throughout the austroriparian, excepting the Texan district. The 
most northern locality from which I have seen a specimen is Michigan, 
as pointed out by Hallowell. Of its occurrence in Massachusetts, Prof. 
J. A. Allen wrote in 1868: 

A specimen is said by Dr. Storer to have been sent him from Barre, and to have 
been found in a mud hole in that place by Dr. Joseph N. Bates. Mr. Linsley ' gives it 
as occurring occasionally near New Haven. Dr. De Kay says it is not uncommon in 
the southern counties of the State of New York, but Massachusetts is quite beyond 
its usual northern range, and it can be expected to occur there but rarely. 

It is rare in eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In Texas I have 
it from Dallas, but have not seen or heard of it west of that locality. 

In its movements the Eumeces quinquelineatus is active, but not nearly 
as much so as the Hceloporus undulatus of the same region. I kept a 
specimen in confinement for a considerable time. After it had been 
without food I introduced into the vivarium with it a number of wood 
Vice {Oniscus sp.). Soon after, I observed the Eumeces performing ex- 
traordinary movements, leaping about, turning somersaults, and rolling 
over. It soon became (quiescent and died. On examination I found 
in its alimentary canal aggregations of the shells of the wood lice, and at 
other points bladder-like expansions of the intestine, inclosed by con- 
strictions. The contents of the canal were fetid, and it was apparent 
that the lizard had gorged itself with the Onisci, which it had been 
unable to pass. The result was decomposition, accumulations of gas, 
and death from wind colic. The gyrations of the reptile render it evi- 
dent that the disorder was no less painful to it than it is to mammals 
under the same conditions. 

Systematic authors generally have given this species as an inhabitant 
of Japan, and commented upon the fact as a remarkable exception to the 
usual laws of geographical distribution. I have examined a specimen 
from Simoda, Japan, and I have not the slightest hesitation in pro- 
nouncing the species distinct. The postnasal is divided into two 
plates, one above the other, instead of one, as in E. quinqueUneatuSj 
together forming a narrow and high plate, as in E. septentrionalis. 
There is but one postmental plate. The frontal is smaller and scarcely 
or not at all in contact with the postnasal. The scales are much larger; 
the ten central above abruptly larger than the lateral. There are 24 ( r 
2oencircling the body. The upper lateral stripe runs through the middle 
of the third row of scales from the central line (nearest the upper ed5;e) 
and the two ui)per lateral are separated by but four rows of scales. In 
quinquelineatus the upper white stripe is generally along the adja- 



1 Storer's Report, p. 41.

cent edges of the fourth aud fifth row, and six rows intervene between 
thiMM instead of the four. There is no trace of the white stripe along 
the posterior face of the thigh seen in quinquelineatus. Other differ- 
ences might be readily found, but these are quite enough to distinguish 
two species. In a specimen from Loo Ohoo there is but one postnasal, 
from the fusioTi of the two seen in the Simoda specimen. Dr. llallowell 
has named one of the Loo Choo specimens above referred to Plestio- 
don marginatus, which is Eumeces marginatus of Boulenger's Catalogue.

with age the stripes become more or less effaced ; the head above reddish 
olive. In variety amblyr/rammus the white stripes broader, occupying 
adjacent two-thirds of two rows of scales, the upper stripes half the 
width of their dorsal interspace, which is uniformly black. 

Limbs short; hind leg. from knee, contained three and one-half times 
in head and body. The fifth hind toe is rather shorter than second, the 
free portion of longest about two-thirds the side of head. 

In Cat. No. 3172ft, the type, there are twenty-five to twenty-seven rows 
of scales around the body, varying with the region, and fifty-eight to 
sixty-three from occiput to above anus. The hind leg reaches forward 
halfway to the middle of the insertion of the arm ; the forelegs only to 
the gape of the mouth. The hind leg, from knee, is contained about 
three and two-thirds times in head and body; the head to ear five and 
one-half times. The arm, from elbow, is about equal to head to ear.

642 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Tail broken at tip, but apparently about one aud one-third times the 
head aud body. The tail is strictly tetragonal and equilateral to the 
end. In nearly all good specimens, however, it is cylindrical. 

In Cat. No. 31726, from same locality with the type, but of considerably 
smaller size, there are twenty-six rows of scales around the body and 
sixty-three from occiput to anus. The hind leg applied forward twice 
reaches halfway between the arm and the ear, the forelegs to the gape* 
The hind leg, from knee, is contained rather less than three and one-half 
times in the head and body; the head to ear about five times; the tail 
is trihedral, the base above and smaller than the sides. From this it 
appears that the older specimens have the body proportionally rather 
more elongated than in younger; the tail longer. 

There appears to be a considerable difference in the size of the limbs, 
especially the hinder. This is smaller in the type of Dr. Hallowell's 
Eumeces quadrilineatus than in most other specimens. The head never 
appears to become very broad, not exceeding two-thirds the length 
to ear. 

The prevailing color of this species is a greenish olive above, with four 
white or greenish -white stripes, the space between the two lateral 
black, the upper stripe bordered internally with black. The strij)es on 
the back are separated by an interval one and one-half times that 
between the two lateral. On the back are two central rows of scales 
of the ground color, each sometimes with a narrow i^osterior border of 
dusky or black. The white stripe on either side occupies the outer 
third (or angular i^ortion) of the adjacent row of scales, and the inner 
half of the next outer (or of the third from the median line) the inner 
half of the second row from the median line black, forming the line just 
mentioned. The black lateral stripe occupies 21 scales on the sides, 
succeeded interiorly by a white stripe two half scales wide, or rather 
on the lower third of one row and the upper half of the next. Between 
the centers of the two lower lateral stripes on either side there thus 
intervene twelve rows of scales. The under parts are of a light salmon 
color, the belly and sides of the body dull bluish. 

Another specimen (Oat. No. 3131) has the lower lateral stripe on one 
row higher up, leaving but If in the dark part, or ten from its middle to 
that of the fellow across the back. There are but twenty-four rows of 
scales around the body. Here, as in the other, the upper white stripe 
begins on the canthus rostralis, just behind the nostrils but rather 
indistinct to above the eye. The second begins along the upper labials 
and runs back through the ear, and above the insertions of the limbs. 
Both are quite distinct on the "tail, where this has not been reproduced, 
the ground color being rather bluish. 

With advancing age the clearness of the markings disappears, and 
there is at first only a line of black spots on the back on the inner half 
of the second row of scales from the middle of the back, two full rows 
intervening between the two. This is a remnant of the black border-

iiig inteiDally tlie upper white stripe, which is faiutly traceable. Then 
comes a dnsky lateral stripe, each scale, however, with a little olive at 
the base. The lower white stripe is very faint. This is the coloration 
in the type specimen Cat. No. 3172cf. In the largest specimen, Cat. No. 
3181^f, the upper ])arts are entirely uniform olive, lighter than in the 
young, the four and live rows from the middle of the back having the 
scales edged slightly with brown. The middle row of large scales 
beneath the tail is plain light-salmon color, the line connecting it with 
the adjacent rows dusky. In old specimens the limbs are shorter, rela- 
tively, than in young ones. In the latter, when appressed to the sides, 
they touch or overlap a little, but in old and large ones they may be 
separated by a space equal to the length of the hand. 

Var. amhlyo,yammus. — A S[)ecimen from Fort Humboldt (Cat. No. 1G6) 
differs from others before me from California in having the dorsal inter- 
space uniformly and continuously black as well as the sides; the four 
bluish-white stripes are very sharply defined, the upper from the nostril. 
The upper lateral stripe occupies the adjacent two-thirds of the second 
and third rows of scales from middle of back and is half as wide as the 
black dorsal interspace. In all other specimens the upper light stripe 
occupies at most only adjacent halves of scales, usually only adjacent 
thirds (especially above), and the width is one-half the dorsal band, 
which is always olive edged with black, 

I have seen the Eumcces sMltonianus from Cape St. Lucas, Lower 
California, on the south, to near the Canadian boundary on the north. 
It is quite abundant and is active in its movements, frequently expos- 
ing itself in the open sunshine. 

Dr. Merriam notes in his report on the Death Valley expedition that 
"specimens of this small lizard were obtained in the Panamint and 
Argus ranges in the Great Basin, and in Kern River Valley and the 
Canada de las TTvas (near old Fort Tejon) on the coastal slope of the 
Great Divide in California." 

Var. hrevipes. — In a large and probably old specimen (Cat. No. 12558) 
there is but one mental ])late, and the limbs are considerably shorter 
than in the adult of the typical form. The color is also modified in a 
way which is different from that seen in otiier adults. Additional 
specimens are necessary to determine the (piestiou of the rank of this 
form. It diverges, however, so widely from the normal that I describe 
it under a distinct name. 

The limbs, appressed to the sides, do not meet by a space equal to the 
length of the forearm and hand, which is more than double the space 
between the limbs in the adults of the typical variety. The hind limb 
is one-third the length from the groin to the end of the muzzle. The 
tail is unusually robust, but the extremity is lost in the specimen. In 
coloration the dorsal ten rows of scales are all alike, dark olive, bor- 
dered with brown. There is a pale spot on the outer border of the 
scales of the third row from the median line on each side, which gives 



644 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



the impression of an indistinct narrow pale streak. Belly and posterior 
gular region blue; chin, throat, a crossband at axillje, and the inferior 
surfaces of limbs and tail, light yellow. The external border of the 
broad median row of subcaudal scales (which are twice as wide as 
those of the adjacent rows) are bordered with plumbeous, forming two 
narrow streaks. The scales of the upper side of the tail are brown 
bordered. The dimensions equal those of the largest adults of the 
usual type.

Plates of head generally similar to those of P. quinquelineatus. The 
frontal small, transversely lozenge-shaped, and about equal to the post- 
frontals. Quite acute laterally, where it touches the posterior post- 
nasal. This is higher than the loreal and is about twice the area of the 
anterior post nasal passing above it, the two of about the same length 
and together about as long as the loreal. The limbs are short, the 
hinder applied forward, reaching halfway to the ear, and contained 
rather more than two and one- 
half times in the body. The 
forelegs reach to the angle of 
the mouth and are longer than 
the head. The hind leg from 
knee is "contained three and 
one-half times in head and 
body and is one and one third 
times the head to ear, which 
again is contained four and 
one- half times in head and 
body. The first toe is rather 
shorter than fifth ; the free por- 
tion of longest toe very little 
more than half the head (to 

ear). Scales on sides arranged very obliquely, so as to render it impos- 
sible to count the en('ircling series. There are, however, about twenty- 
eight rows, and about fifty-seven from head to tail. 

The very young in this species (head and body, 37.5 mm.) is entirely 
black, the end of the tail becoming bluish; each plate on the side of 
the head above, each labial, upper and lower, and each mental plate 
with a conspicuous, rounded, bluish-white spot occupying all but the 
outer border. The etfect is that of three rows of spots on the side of 
head and one on each side the chin. The middle lateral, or that on 
the upper labial, is continued backward as a large spot in front of the 
ear and another on its i)osterior edge running out behind into a point. 
There are traces of similar spots on the other cephalic plates, but 
much less distinct. 

With advancing age the ground color becomes more olivaceous, paler 
beneath, each up]>er scale with a posterior margin of darker olive 
very well defined. These characters continue until the specimen is 
75 mm. long, head and body (Cat. Xo. 31(52), the spots on the chin only 
disappearing in the pale olivaceous green of tlie under parts. In Cat. 
No. 31(51* the light line through the ear is continued faintly to the foreleg.

(Type, Cat. No. 3133.) The character of the cephalic plates appears 
to be essentially the same as in E. quinquelineatus. The limbs are short ; 
the hinder applied forward reach just three times to the tip of nose. The 
fore legs reach forward to the angle of the mouth. The hind leg from 
knee is about one and one-fifth the head to ear, which is contained five 
times in the head and body, the hind leg from knee, four and one third 
times. The neck is thick; the width of head three-fourths the length. 
The toes are short and thick, the fifth hinder decidedly less than the 
second, instead of longer, as in quinquelineaUis. The toes are all short; 
the free portion of longest less than half the head to ear; the fifth less 
than second. Claws long, acute. There are twenty-six rows of scales 
around the body, and fifty-nine from occiput to tail. 

Adult light yellowish or reddish blue, each scale with a dusky border, 
greenish white beneath. Head with a reddish tinge. Young black, 
the tip and sides of chin white; the labials spotted with white. Five 
very faint whitish lines; the upper lateral on adjacent edge of scales; 
the lower distinct only on side of neck. Faint spots on side of neck, 
cephalic plates above not spotted. 

This species appears to be characterized among its immediate allies 
by the shortness of the hind toes, the fifth hind toe conspicuously 
shorter than the second. The description given above is from the type 
(Cat. No. 3133), which is an old individual. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES.

In a siuglo very youug specimen (Cat. No. 3113), head and body 
thirty-four millimeters long, I find what I consider the very young stage 
of this species. The distance from the centers of insertion of the fore to 
that of tiie hind leg is one and one-half times that from the former to the 
snout. The hind leg applied forward twice, reaches a little more than 
halfway from arm to ear, and is contained two and two-thirds times in 
the head and body. The hind leg from knee is contained three and 
one-half times in the head and body. The fore leg fi^om elbow is about 
equal to the head. The fifth hind toe is decidedly shorter than the 
second, the free portion of longest toe barely exceeding half the side of 
head. The head is broad, depressed. The color is an intense black, 
rather bluish beneath. There are five excessively faint, slender, whitish 
lines, a median dorsal, an upper lateral on the adjacent edges of the 




Fig. 128.

Cat. No. 14776, U.S.N.M. 

third and fourth rows of scales. The lower lateral stripe is only appre- 
ciable on the ue(;k. The extreme tip of the chin and sides of head 
beneath are whitish; the sides of the jaws are similar, but the sides of 
the labials are dusky. The posterior labials each have a large spot of 
white continued one anterior to and another behind the ear. The upper 
lateral stripe is continued along the side of the upper surface of the 
head, but the ])lates are not s])<)tted. 

This type of youngest coloration ditfers from that oi </uttuIatus in the 
presence of fine light lines instead of a uniform black. The tip and 
sides of chin are entirely whitish, with an occasional dusky spot, instead 
of having each plate on the sides spotted shari)ly with white. The 
lower labials are more continuously whitish, and the upper are white, 
with the upper and lateral edges dusky, instead of having each labial 



648 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

black witli a ceutral white spot. The posterior upper labials, indeed, 
are spotted, and there is a spot anterior to and one behind the ear, but 
no farther, neither are there the spots on the sides of the head above, 
but, instead, a faint continuous line. 

I have before me no such series of specimens as of guttulatus, but one 
nearly as large as the type Cat. No. 31(51 is distinctly marked with nearly 
black lines on a light olive ground, the upper labials distinctly spotted. 
There is a broad central stripe of the light olive, occupying the adjacent 
two-thirds of the two middle rows of scales. The upper edge of the 
second row, however, is olive, this color interdigitating with the black 
on the outside of second row. In this respect it differs from the corre- 
sponding stripe of imdtivirgatus, in which the adjacent thirds of the 
first and second rows are involved in a common brown stripe. The 
adjacent edges of the second and third rows of scales are brown. This 
is followed by four light and three dark stripes. The most conspicuous 
markings, however, are the four dark stripes on 4f rows of scales, the 
central third of the space being plain olive, the two dark f-tripes on 
each side of this being nearly equal to each other and to their olive 
interspace. The scales have no dusky edging behind in the light 
stripes. This differs from multivirgatns again, in having the inner 
dark dorsal stripe as small and even smaller than the other, instead of 
larger. 

In Cat. No. 4140, still larger than the type, the upper dorsal dark 
liiu^ has disappeared, leaving the lower quite distinct (separated from 
its fellow by four rows of scales). All the dorsal scales are margined 
behind with dusky. 

All the other large specimens are entirely without lines. All the 
scales edged behind with dusky. Cat. No. 3161, however, has none of 
the scales with dusky edges behind where traversed by the olive strii)es. 

In respect to the very largest specimens I have no means of deciding 
as to whether they really belong here or to guttulatus. I have decided 
the question chiefly on account of the short legs and hind toes. One 
of these from Matamoras, Cat. No. 3151, is the stoutest North American 
skink I have ever seen. The head and body together measure 5 inches; 
the head is 27.5 mm. wide, or equal to the distance from nostril to ear, 
and the circumference of the perfectly cylindrical body where thickest 
is 100 mm. 

The postnasal plate is sometimes absent. Such is the case in Cat. 
Nos. 4770, 5247, and 7842. In Cat. No. 9225 it is present on one side 
and absent on the other. These have 28 rows of scales, except Cat. No. 
7842, which has 26. 

Some exceptional forms of Eumeces ohsoletus have been sent me from 
Douglas County, Kansas, by Prof. F. H. Snow, of Lawrence. It is rep- 
resented by three large adult individuals of very light colors. They 
differ remarkably in the scuta of the nose. In one the frontonasals 
and supranasals are in contact; in the other two they are separated by 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 649 

tlie prefreuals. In the former there is one prefrenal oa both sides, and 
a postnasal on one side. In No. 2 there is a postnasal on each side, 
and two prefreaals, one above tbe other, on one side only. In No. 3 
the postnasal plate is elevate<l and is in contact above with the inter 
frontonasal. On one side of the head it is divided by a horizontal 
fissure into two scuta, one above the other; the other side is undivided. 
The liinder leg measures one-third the distance from its base to the end 
of the muzzle. When extended along the side, the fore and hinder limbs 
just touch the extremities of each other's claws. The second and fifth 
posterior toes are of equal length. Color pale ashen, with a bluish or 
greenish tinge. The external edges of the scales of the second row 
from the median line are brown, forming a longitudinal line on each 
side. In the same way the edges of the scales of the oblique lateral 
rows of scales are brown. These oblique brown lines are each six or 
seven scales long ; anteriorly they become more longitudinal, two paral- 
lel lines running backwards from above the superior border of the ear. 
Superior labial plates brown-edged. Scales of posterior faces of limbs 
brown edged. 

Measurements. — Length to vent, 101 mm.; length to axilla, 38 mm.; 
length to meatus of ear, 20 mm. ; length of hind leg, 32 mm. 

No. 1 is colored like No. 3, omitting the dorsal lines; No. 2 is like No. 
1, except that the lateral brown forms a loose band. 

This species is characteristic of the Central region of the Nearctic 
Eealm, not occurring in the Eastern, Austroriparian, or Pacific regions. 
It overruns a little into the borders of the Texan district and the Sono 
ran region. It ranges from the Platte Eiver, Nebraska, on the north 
to the city of Chihuahua on the south. Mr. Marnock obtained this 
species near Helotes, Texas, where it is rare. I saw, but did not suc- 
ceed in capturing, a lizard which I suppose to belong to this species, 
near the head waters of the Medina River. It was of dark tints, with 
light spots on the sides of the head, like the younger stages described 
by Professor Baird. It was concealed beneath the bark of a log, and, 
evading for a considerable time my attempts to take it, finally escaped.

The species belongs to the group of the U. qiiinqtielineatus, having a 
small postnasal in front of the base of the preloreal, and has but twenty- 
four rows of scales. The preloreal reaches the transverse interfronto- 
nasal, which is smaller than each prefrontal. The limbs are not very 
short, being separated when applied to the side by a space less than the 
length of the forefoot. The coloration is as follows : Tlie median dorsal 
pale band covers only the adjacent halves of the two median rows of 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 651 

scales. A black band bordering itoccupies the remaining half of tbe row 
with the adjacent half of the next row. The remaining half of the next 
row is occupied by a pale band. A black line passes along the adja- 
cent edge of the next row, whose middle is white. The external edge 
of the same row is involved in the superior edge of a wide band, which 
covers two rows and two half rows. Thus there are three dark bands 
on each side of the middle line, the inferior being the widest. Alto- 
gether they cover only five and a half rows of scales on each side. 
There are also no lateral light bauds, as in many species, but the color 
of the abdomen extends to the lower dark baud. Size rather small; 
length of head and body, 70 mm. 

This species is allied to the IJ. leptogrammus Baird. Most of the speci- 
mens of that species have twenty-six rows of scales, but one of tliem 
has twenty-four. In all the specimens of the latter the internasal is 
relatively larger, equaling, or nearly equaling, a prefrontal; in E. epi- 
pleurotus it is about half as large as a prefrontal. The rostral plate in 
U. epipleurotns is more elevated and acuminate above, its lateral labial 
border being about one-third the remainder, while in E. leptogrammus 
it is more than half the length of the same. The anterior vental is 
smaller. The appressed limbs of the E. leptogrammus touch each other. 
It is possible, but very uncertain, that Boulenger is right in supposing 
E. epipleurottis to be the adult of E. leptogrammus. 

I find but one specimen at present in the U. S. iSTational Museum 
which is the original type.

Head short, rather broad, and with the lateral protile sloping con-

though the posterior postnasal sometimes entirely above the first, or 
divided in two. Seven upper labials. Limbs short and weak. Hind

from foot is about one-third the head and body; from knee is contained 
nearly four times. Fore leg from elbow is not equal to head from

the median scarcely wider, and fifty-eight from head to tail; fifth hind 
toe shorter than second, free portion two-fifths the size of head to ear.

Rfc^PORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



General color black, olivaceous above, with five very narrow and 
inconspicuous greenish-white dotted stripes; one dorsal (widest) and 
two lateral on each side. Tail and body beneath dark blue. Chin, 
throat, and upper labials white. The upper lateral stripe along the 
middle of the third row of scales from the median line; the lower on 
the middle of the third from this. Scarcely a trace of the bifurcation 
of the middle dorsal stripe; the hind legs uniform black. 

The dorsal stripe is on the adjacent edges of two rows of scales. 
The others each on the middle of one series, thus differing from P. 
quimpielineatiis, in which they are on adjacent edges. The lateral 
stripes are not continuous lines, but only a succession of dots, one 
central on each scale. The median stripe is similarly constituted by 
dots on the adjacent edges of two rows of scales, and is usually less 
distinct than the lateral. There is a faint indication that the remainder 

of the white dotted scales is 
black, leaving a dark olivaceous 
row on each side the back, each 
scale in which sometimes has 
a lighter center. There can 
scarcely be said to be a bifurca- 
tion anteriorly of the median 
stripe. There are four entire 
rows of scales on the back be- 
tween the upi^er lateral stripes. 
This species, remarkable for 
its diminutive size, has the gen- 
eral appearance of a very young 
P. qninqueUneatus, but differs in 
being darker, in having the light 
lines very narrow and inconspicuous, not continuous, but formed by a 
succession of whitish dots, the lateral on the centers of single rows of 
scales instead of on their adjacent edges. The hind legs are entirely 
black without a trace of the posterior white line. The cephalic bifurca- 
tion is wanting. The head is shorter, higher, and more arched- The 
dorsal is shorter. There are seven labials instead of eight. The legs 
are much weaker and smaller, the hinder contained three times instead 
of two and one-half or less in the head and body. The scales are fewer 
in number. The hinder postnasal is very apt to be the first above to 
accommodate the brevity of the muzzle. 
This is also a species of the Central region.

Body ('ylindri(;al; slender; legs far apart. Head short; conv^ex 
above; two postnasals, usually of equal size, one exactly above the 
other. Very rarely one higher behind the other or divided into two. 
Seven upper labials. Ear very small, circular. Hind legs applied 
forward twice fall behind the fore leg, and three times reaches to the 
angle of the mouth, and is contained three and one-third times in 
head and body; from knee contained four and a half times. Fore leg 
from elbow as long or rather longer than from snout to ear, which is 
contained five and a half or six times in the head and body. Tail one 
and a half times the 
head and body. Fifth 
hind toe shorter than 
second ; free portion of 
longest toe more than 
half the head — about 
three fifths. There are 
twenty-four to twenty- 
six rows of scales round 
body, and about sixty- 
threeabove in line from 
head to tail. The lat- 
eral rows are quite 
longitudinal and par- 
allel to the dorsal. 

Oolor pale olive, 
green, or gray, lighter 
beneath and on the 

sides, with four or five brown stripes on each side. Every row of scales 
striped with brown and tho ground color. There is a narrow whitish 
stripe through the middle of the third row of scales from the dorsal 
line; the sides of the scales brown; above this line are two brown 
stripes, the inner wider; below it are three others, the middle broad- 
est and along the edge of the head. The scales on the tail and legs 
are edged with brown; chin paler than the belly; the labials whitish, 
without brown, except on the upper edge. 

As already stated, the back is much varied with lines of very light 
olive, greenish, or greenish ash, and brown. The key to the coloration 
is to be sought in a narrow line, lighter than the rest and sometimes 
almost white, which begins on the edge of the upper surface of the 
head and extends backward along the central third of the third row of 
scales from the median line of the back. The two sides of this row

being brown gives rise to two of the narrow brown lines. The adja- 
cent or inner half of the two median dorsal rows are plain and of the 
gronnd color; their exterior halves and the adjacent third of the next 
row are brown, producing the broad dorsal stripe. The second row of 
scales is thus lett olivaceous along the central third, and brown exter- 
nally, much as in the third row. The inner or upper half of the fourth 
row is light olive, interdigitating into the brown of the third row; its 
lower half, with the upper third of the next or fifth row, forms the 
second broad brown stripe. The central and lower third of this fifth 
row is light, the upper third brown. The next, or sixth, row when col- 
ored has a light line along the center, the sides brown, the lower 
brown, sometimes the upper wanting. 

This species is very similar to that described as P. leptogrammus, but 
has a shorter head, much more elongated body, and feebler limbs; 
almost always two postorbitals, one above the other, not behind it. 
The theory of coloration is much the same, it being only necessary to 
have leptogrammus become light olive in the ground color, and the 
indications of dark stripes to become more distinct by the contrast. 
Indeed, but for the total difference in proi)ortions, as substantiated by 
the comparison of a large number of specimens of each, I would have 
no hesitation in combining them. 

A color variety which is unstri]ied was regarded by Baird as a dis- 
tinct species under the name of Plestiodon inornatus. A specimen 
displays the following general characters: 

Body cylindrical, slender. Legs far apart. Head short, conical, C(m- 
vex above, as high as broad; two small postnasals, about equal, one 
exactly above the other. Hind leg applied forward twice reaches four- 
fifths of the way to the fore leg; three lengths reach to the ear; it is 
contained three and one-half times in the head and body; from the knee 
nearly five times. Fore leg from elbow as long as from snout to ear, 
which is contained five and one half times in head and body. Tail one 
and one-half times head and body, constricted at base, then swelling. 
Fifth hind toe shorter than second; free portion of longest barely 
exceeding half the head to ears; about twenty-four rows of scales 
round the body; the lateral parallel to the dorsal; about fifty-eight 
scales from head to tail. 

Color, very light olive, tinged beneath with bluish; without any 
dusky marks whatever; whiter beneath the head.

from knee, four andone half times ; head, five times. Fifth hind toe shorter 
than second; free portion of longest two-thirds the side of the head. 

Above reddish or greenish, olivaceous or ashy, with four principal 
nearly equidistant white stripes, two on each side, on the centers of rows 
of scales, and margined with dotted lines of dusky. A third intermedi- 
ate line traceable anteriorly. Upper lateral sti-ipes separated by two 
plain rows of scales ; sides between the stripes with the scales edged be- 
hind with dusky. The lower lateral stripe begins on the labial and passes 
above the ears; beneath, white with a tinge of salmon color. 

This species is very small and delicate, the limbs weak, although the 
toes are very long. The head is conical, pointed. The ears are very 
minute, not larger than the puncture of a fine pin.

The rows of scales traversed centrally by the light stripes have the 
edges dusky. The upper stripe passes through the center of the second 
row, the long lower one through that of sixth. The Intermediate line, 
not always appreciable, and confined to the anterior half of body, 
traverses the center of the fourth row. The lateral scales between 
these stripes are dusky behind ; those on the back are plain. The lower 
edge of the posterior upper labials is spotted with dusky; the white 
stripe on the labials very distinct from the snout and suffused above with 
blackish. The anteorbitals and postorbitals are each white and black. 
There are no distinct lines on the legs. The young are probably 
entirely black between the lateral stripes. The tail has dusky lines on 
the sides, but no white ones, nor is there blue anywhere. 

This species is more slender and elongated than any of its allies with 
a single nasal, and is easily distinguished by color and the separation 
of the upper lateral stripes by two rows of scales. The fusion of the 
third and fourth large supraorbital plates, counting from behind, is a 
striking peculiarity. The dorsal intervals of the stripes is seemingly 
greater than the lateral.

Body and neck cylindrical, stout; head small, conical, and depressed. 
Interfrontonasal plate small, rhomboidal, embraced between the supra- 
nasals and prefrontals, which are broadly in contact. A single post- 
nasal (about equal to the nasal), equal in height and half the length of 
the loreal. Seven upper la,bials, two mentals, limbs short, the hinder 
reaching forward less than halfway to the fore legs and contained 
three and one half to four times in head and body. From nose to cen- 
ter of insertion of fore leg is half way from this to hinder leg (in one 
specimen to anus). Head (to ear) contained between five to six times 
in head and body. Fifth hind toe a little shorter than second ; the free 
portion of longest toe equal half the side of head. There are twenty- 
eight rows of scales around the body, the lateral quite parallel with 
the dorsal and fifty-nine scales from head to tail. Tail one and three- 
fourths times the body. 

General color above light olive green with two lateral white stripes

inclosing a black one, the upper on each side along the center of one row 
of scales and separated by six dorsal rows. Four equal and equidistant 
black dorsal stripes between the white ones, each on two adjacent 
half rows of scales, the exterior margining the white lines, the inner 
obsolete in old specimens. Beneath greenish white, more yellowish 
under the chin, lower white line passing above the ear. Upper labials 
white. A faint whitish line below the thigh, margined above and below 
with dusky. 

The frontal is sometimes very small or even wanting, and always 
(with rare exceptions^ cut off from contact with the postnasal. In one 
specimen it is applied against the frontal. In the most typical speci-

mens the frontal, the postfrontal, and internasals are all rhomboidal, 
the latter rather smaller and transversely; the rest about equal, their 
longer axis longitudinal. 

In the smallest specimen of Cat. No. 3156 the hind legs reach forward 
half way to the center of insertion of fore leg, the third application 
falling a little short of the nose. In the other two, however, three appli- 
cations of this length reaches only to the ear. The small specimen has 
longer limbs than the largest, in which the hind foot from heel is con- 
tained five times in head and body. The white lateral lines are very 
well defined and narrow, the upper beginning on the superciliary edge, 
the lower beneath the eye on the upper edge of the fifth labial and 
passing upwards so as to proceed backwards along the upper edge of 
the ear and not through it, as in most species. Posteriorly, it usually 
passes along the center of the second row below that traversed by the 
upper line, the black interval being then 1 and | scales wide. Fre- 
quently these intervening black scales are olivaceous at their bases, so

as to produce the effect of a succession of uarrow light crescents, the 
concavity posterior. The lower white line is usually margined nar- 
rowly below by blackish. 

It is probable that in the very young the adjacent edges of the two 
central and the third and fourth lateral upper rows of scales form whit- 
ish lines alternating with the dusky ones. They, however, fade out. 
The two central dusky stripes are not pure black as is that margining 
the upper lateral stripe above, and soon fade, but there is generally a 
trace left along the adjacent edges of the first and second rows in each 
side. The scales below the lateral stripes have rather paler edges. 
The lateral strij)es extend some distance on the tail. 

A comparison is scarcely needed between this species and the 
U. quinqnelineatus, one having a postnasal, the other none, with other 
differences in the head and many in general proportions. The upper 
lateral stripe is on the middle of one row, not on adjacent edges of two; 
the lateral stripes are closer together; the lower passing above the ear 
instead of through it. 

This is another species of the plains of the Central region, and 
it ranges farther north than any species of the genus, that is, to the 
northern part of Minnesota. 

Cat. No. 11840 from Old Fort Cobb presents a remarkable exception 
to the normal character, in having the frontonasal extended laterally so 
as to reach the loreal on both sides. This specimen is otherwise normal. 
In Cat. Xo. 15685 the internasal is similarly extended to the loreal, but 
the contact on one side is very slight. The color is peculiar, being 
olivaceous, with a brown band on each side which covers one and two 
half rows of scales, and has a pale border above throughout as far for- 
ward as the supraorbital plates. It is pale bordered below from the 
auricular meatus to near the middle of the side. 

A large adult (Cat. No. 11699) is uniform dark brown above, and 
yellowish brown below. 

The two specimens, Cat. No. 5325, differ from the types in the rela- 
tively longer legs. They are, when extended on the side, only sepa- 
rated by a space equal to the length of the forefoot. In the typical form 
the space is equal to the length of the forearm and forefoot together.

One specimen only is in my collection; it was procured near Dallas 
by Mr. Boll. In size, it is above the average in the genus. 

1 find on comparison of this species with specimens of E. septentrion- 
alls Baird from Neosho Falls, Kansas, in the National Museum, that the 
differences between the two species are not great, but that they are 
nevertheless sufiQcieutly distinguished by the following characters : 

E. jxichyurits. E. septentrionaUs. 

Postnasal scute reaching iuterfronto- Postnasal widely separated from iuter- 

uasal. frontonasal. 

No dark dorsal stripes. Two black dorsal stripes. 

Rows of scales, 26. Rows of scales, 28. 

Unfortunately I have temporarily mislaid the only specimen of this 
very distinct species which 1 have seen, and can not therefore give a 
figure of it.

The under parts are always olive green instead of blue black or bluish 
in the young, changing to greenish in tbe older ones. The color of the 
back is rather a reddish than greenish olive in many specimens. The 
scales are much smaller, there being generally 28 round the body 
instead of 24. The lateral scales have generally a darker border in 
old specimens. Sometimes there is a dusky olive spot at the base of 
each dorsal scale. The upper labials are almost entirely whitish, like 
the chin. In the collection are ten s])ecimens from Matamoras which 
agree i)recisely in every respect with the others, except that the body 
appears more cylindrical and rigid. The color, however, almost uni- 
form lustrous black above. This color shaded, especially below and on 
the tail, with very dark olive. I can scarcely believe it to be a distinct 
species, however, and prefer to consider it as a black variety. The 
largest is fully equal in size to any of the striped specimens, the head 
and body measuring U2 mm. 
This skink is so far known only from Texas.

The black ui)|)er border to the upper lateral stripe is sometimes a 
dotted line instead of being continuous. 

In a single si)ecimeu (Cut. No. 3123) there is the faintest possible 
trace of a light dorsal line, with remains of a dusky Literal edging 
in the form of fine blackish dots. This marking, however, is very 
obscure. 

The occurrence of six rows of olive-colored scales between the dorsal 
stripes will not necessarily determine a si)ecimen to be U. tetragrammu.s^ 
this being more the result of the multiplication of dorsal scales. To 
ascertain the species reference must then be had to the amount of dusky 
color on the sides and above the upper stripe, or whether the latter is 
like the rest of the back, whether the mental plate is single or double, 
the postnasal with its hinder edge above the middle of the second labial 
or in line with its edge. 

This species belongs to the Eastern region, being most abundant in 
the Allegheny district, from Pennsylvania southward. It also occurs 
in Texas.

This is a Eumeces of the group of the E. anthracinus. It has there- 
fore four supraorbital plates and no postnasal. Its loreals are like 
those of that species smdE.pachyu- 
rus, of a rather elevated form, the 
prenasal reaching the transverse in-

are wedged between the fourth and 
fifth superior labials, of which the 
fifth is elongate and beneath the 
orbit. The scales are in twenty-six 
rows and the limbs well developed;

is a faint trace in the typical specimen of a pale vertebral line with 
a dark border on each side, and there is a black border above the 
upper lateral line and another below the inferior lateral line. Ihese

The elevated form of the loreals and undivided mental plate ally this 
species to the E. anthracinus. The more numerous scales and labial 
plates the wide interfrontonasal and different coloration distinguish it. 
From K pachyurus its well-developed limbs separate it. In K brevih- 

neatus the loreal plates are differ- 
ently formed and the coloration is 
totally different. The size is rather 
small. But one specimen of this 
species is known. It was taken near 
Mobile, Alabama, by Dr. Joseph Cor-

portant additions to Eocene verte-

The following are the skeletal characters of this family: 

Premaxillary single. Epipterygoid present. Angular and surangu- 
lar bones confluent. Supratemj)oral in contact with parietal, closing 
the supratemporal foramen. Meckelian groove open. 

Tongue covered with imbricate papilla?.. Teeth few, conical, slightly 
hooked, Interorbital septum well developed; no bony postorbital 
arch; infraorbital fossa present, bounded by the palatine and trans- 
verse bones; i)alatines and pterygoids not meeting on the median line 
of the palate. Limbs absent ; pectoral and pelvic arches reduced to a 
small, slender bone on each side. Abdominal ribs present. 

Body vermiform, with osteodermal plates, as in the Scincidte. Eyes 
conciealed under the skin. No ear 0]>ening. No preanal pores. 

The few members of this family, a degraded type of the Scincidae, 
with which they are closely connected through the genus Acontias, are 
burrowers, and were at one time believed to be confined to tropical and 
south Africa, but a genus which I added from Mexico shows that the 
Scincoid lizards have undergone in the New World the same degenera- 
tive process as in the Old World.

6C)G REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

In Feylinia there is a loag squamosal articulated to the side of the 
parietal, as in Rliineura aud Cephalopeltis; the prem axillary is single, 
and the palatine lamina' of the maxillary are dilated. The spleuio- 
mental groove is open. There are two slender clavicles united 
medially and giving insertion to the thoracic hiemapophyses. These, 
according to IJathke, are present, but not in contact in Acontias, and 
Peters aud Stannius failed to find them in Typhloscincus. The pelvis 
I find to be represented by an oblique bone at the extremities of two 
pairs of ribs on each side of the vent. 

Two of the three genera of this family display the following degra- 
dational characters of the arches and limbs. 

Anelytropsis papillosns Cope, from Eastern Mexico. Xot previously 
examined. 

No scapular arch; pelvic arch rudimental; no external limbs. 

Pelvic arch. — This is represented by two elements, a proximal and a 
distal. The former is directed downward and forward. Its proximal 
extremity is articulated with a single simple di apophysis, from which 
it extends a short distance posteriorly in a horizontal direction as far 
as the posterior extremity of the centrum of the same vertebra. From 
the inner side of its distal extremity there extends posteriorly a simple 
rod-like bone to a point in line with the anterior nmrgin of the vent. 
Its length is about equal to that of the superior element. The superior 
element is ilium, but the inferior does'not api)ear to be either j)ubis or 
ischium. Its position and direction are not inconsistent with its iden- 
tification with the femur; but as it occurs in snakes, which have a 
rudimental femur, it can not be that bone. 

Observations. — The inferior element in the pelvis in this genus is the 
same as that which I described as occurring in the African form of this 
family, Feylinia [Anelytrops Hallowell), but the latter differs in the 
absence of the rib-like ilium. It is interesting to notice the resem- 
blance between these genera, which are so widely removed geographi- 
cally. Feylinia, however, differs further from Anelytropsis in the pres- 
ence of a pair of clavicles. 

Feylinia citrrori Gray. Described by me.' From West Africa. 

Scapular arch. — This consists of a pair of osseous clavicles which 
nearly meet on the median line. The anterior ribs to the number of 
seven pairs meet on the median line by their cartilaginous luema- 
pophyses, which are directed forward at an acute angle, the angle of 
the anterior pair intervening between the clavicles. 

Pelvic arch. — This consists of a single element lying on each side of 
the vent antero-posteriorly, perhaps homologous with the correspond- 
ing element in the Aunulati. It is in contact with the distal extremi- 
ties of three ribs, aud is connected by ligament with a third anterior to 
them. These are the last ribs, and they are followed by a pair of sacral 
vertebrae whose diapophyses are united distally. 



' Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1864, p. 230. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. CyGl 

Remarks. — This [>elvic element is probably the iliopectineal element 
of Fiirbringer. The pelvis diS'ers from that of Anelytropfiis [antea) in 
the absence of iliac element. 

ANKLYTROPSIS Cope. 

Anelytropsis Cope, Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc, XXII, 1885, p. 380. — Boulexger, (at. 
Liz. Brit. Mus,, 2d ed., II, p. 430. 

Rostral plate capping muzzle, the nostril at the junction of its pos- 
terior border with the suture separating the loreal and first labial. No 
frontonasal nor supraorbital plates. Three plates on top of head, 
which should probably be identified as anterior and posterior frontal 
and parietal. Eye scarcely visible through the single ocular plate. 
Scales equal, smooth. Vent not terminal. No limbs. No preaual 
pores. 

This genus only differs from Feylinia Gray {=A)ielytrop.s Hallo well) 
in the arrangement of the lateral plates of the muzzle. In that genus 
and Typhlosounis, the only other genus of the family, the rostral plate 
is as in Acontias; that is, divided longitudinally on each side by a fis- 
sure which extends from the nostril posteriorly. Whether the internal 
characters differ remains to be ascertained.' I give the genus the 
name Anelytropsis in order to justify the family name Anelytropida*. 
This will produce no confusion, as the name Anelytrops was given by 
Hallo well to the genus which had previously been named Feylinia, and 
as a synonym disappears from view. 

The present form is essentially interesting as a representative of the 
family of the Anelytropidie, or the Typhlophthalm lizards with the eye 
entirely concealed, and with the tongue scaly. The importance of this 
discovery is considerable, as it shows that the scincoid lizards have 
undergone in the New World the same degenerative process as in the 
Old World, and in the same way. This is a new fact, even supposing that 
the Anniellidic of America are a degenerate form of the same familj-, 
which is not probable. Dr. Bouleuger believes that that family is a 
degenerate type of the Anguid stem — a view in which I suspect he is 
correct. Anelytropsis is a degree farther down in the scale than 
AnnieUa, in having the epidermis absolutely continuous over the eye, as 
in other members of the family of Anelytropidie, and as in the Typli- 
lopid family of snakes. As in other forms of this character, the life of 
this type is doubtless subterranean, which accounts for its having so 
long escaped observation.

BouLENGKH, Cat. I.iz. Brit. Mus., 2d ed., II, 1885, p. 431. 

Form slender. Tail moderately long, with obtuse extremity. Scales 
scincoid, with rounded edges, everywhere equal, including the preanal 
region. Color brownish flesh color. 

The head is distinguishable from the body by its slightly greater 
width, and is slightly contracted at the position of the orbits, and con- 
tinued as a distinct muzzle. The body is cylindrical, and the tail is a 
little longer than one-fourth the total length. Twenty longitudinal 
series of scales. The area represented by the rostral plate of Acontias 
is invaded on each side by two labial ]»lates, and a large loreal above 
them. Behind the second labial plate is a very small third, and above 
it is a large ocular plate which extends upward and forward to a line 
with the superior border of the loreal. The pale spot which represents 
the eye is situated in the lower i:)osterior corner. The fourth and last 
labial is a little larger than the second, and has a narrowly rounded 
posterior extremity. Above it is a small postocular, which is in con- 
tact with the posterior frontal. On the summit of the hrad there are 
three scuta. The anterior, or anterior frontal, is the smallest. It forms 
a transverse band between the loreal and ocular of one side and those 
of the other. The succeeding plate, the postfrontal, is the largest. It 
is succeeded by the parietal, which is a transverse plate, concave in 
front and convex posteriorly, and which is separated from the post- 
ocular on each side by a single scale. Posterior to this scute, the scales 
of the body begin. 

There is a large symphyseal plate which is a triangle with its apex 
posterior and truncate. It is bounded on each side by a very large 
inferior labial, which is also a triangle. This is followed on the labial 
margin by two very small labial plates. A small body scale succeeds 
the symphyseal, and this is connected with the small posterior labials 
by a narrow i)late on each side. These are followed by the body scales. 
Six laterally imbricated scales bound the vent in front. 

Measurements. — Total length, 170 mm.; length of tail, 45 mm.; of 
head, to line connecting rictus oris, 41 mm. 

The rostral, loreal, and anterior two labial scuta are marked with 
minute papilla), which, when removed, leave punctiform impressions. 
They are not very closely placed. Two specimens from near Jalapa. 
None in the U. S. National Museum.

Petrosal bone produced anterior to the anterior semicircular canal, 
articulating with the margin of the decurved parietal. Olfactory lobes 
uuderarched by frontal bones; no supratemporal. Occipital closely 
articulated witli parietals. Cervical and caudal intercentra coossifled 
with the centra. Palatine and pterygoid foramina preseut. Tongue 
papillose ; no ceratohyals. 

This superfamily is, as already indicated, allied to the Anuulati, but 
is distinguished by the characters given in the analytical table of super- 
families on p. L'UO, as well as by various others of less significance. 

There is but one family, which is characterized as follows: 

An eye fissure; scales preseut; teeth subpleurodont; no limbs; no postorbital arch; 
spleuiomental groove closed ANNiKLLlDiE.

the presplienoidal vacuity and cousequently the iuterorbital septum, 
and the boues wliicb coustitute the brain case firmly united; a colu- 
melJa crauii, no supratemporal ; postorbital arch ligamentous, ptery- 
goids not in contact with sphenoid; a palatine foramen; premaxlllary 
single; nasal and frontal divided ; parietal single; preorbital and post- 
orbital in contact, separating the frontal from the border of the orbit. 

The viscera display the following characters in the genus Anniella: 
The left lung is much smaller than the right lung, and is proximally 
fused with it so that there is but a single lumen. Right lung much 
enlarged and covering the alimentary canal below (ventrad). Liver 
considerably posterior to heart, long and narrow, with a small left lobe 
and a long right lobe extending to the reproductive cells. Gall blad- 
der inclosed by the liver and exposed interiorly, that is, occupying a 
foramen, as in the Diploglossa. Alimentary canal distinguished into 
stomach, and small and large intestine, without distinct colon. 
Stoniach without curvature; small intestine moderately plicated, with 
lacertiform mesentery. Reproductive cells anterior, symmetrical; kid- 
neys symmetrical, j)osterior. There is a single gastrohepatic mesentery 
from the middle line of the liver, and no right hepatic or lateral 
hepatics. Hepatoventral simple; plates of epigastric very loosely 
attached together. No pulmonaries at middle of liver. 

The fusion of the lungs is a peculiarity that I have not noticed else- 
where among the Sauria. The left lung is like a diverticulum of the 
right, and posterior to the point of divergence from the latter is bound 
to it by connective tissue to the extremity. This fusion is a step nearer 
to obliteration than occurs in any of the serpentiform genera of Teii- 
da^, Scincida?, or Anguidie, where, though of reduced size, it is distinct 
from the right except at its proximal extremity. 

The aftiuities of the Anniellidte, as indicated by the osteology, are 
interesting. When I first, in 1864,' pointed out the cranial peculiari- 
ties of the genus Anniella, I created for it a distinct family, which I 
associated with the Acontiid^e and Anelytropsidie. Subsequently, in 
1887,2 1 proposed for it a still more independent position, making it the 
type of a special superfamily, which I called the Anguisauri; a course 
which had been already adopted by Gill a short time previously,^ who 
X)roposed for it the suj^erfamily of the Annielloidea. The further knowl- 
edge of its structure above recorded brings out more clearly its true 
position which I gave it in 1892.^ This is, I think, in the Aunulati or 
Amphisbfenia. The characters which indicate this reference are: (1) 
The continuity of the parietal with the petrosal and supraoccipital 
elements. (2) The absence of ceratohyal elements. (3) The hypo- 
pophyses of the cervical vertebrae which are continuous with the centra.

(4) The partially opeu chevron bones, wbicli are also continuous with 
the centra. (5) The position of the lung ventral to the alimentary 
canal. 

There is agreement in various subordinate features, as the single pre 
maxillary, double frontal, and single parietal ; and the absence of supra- 
temporal bone; also the fusion of the surangular and articular bones. 
There are some differences to be noted. Thus, in some of the Amphis- 
biL'uia at least, there is apparently an orbitosphenoid bone, which is 
wanting in Anniella. The i)terygoid is more closely adherent to the 
basis cranii in the Amphisbrenia, and there is no palatine foramen, 
which is present in Anniella. The sj)leuial is of full size in Anniella 
and the Meckelian groove is opeu. In the Amphisbnenia the groove is 
closed and the splenial is much reduced. There is no epipterygoid in 
the typical Amphisbivnia. 

The presence of scales, the papillose tongue, and the distinct tegu- 
mentary eye fissure, with the characters above cited, define the Anniel- 
lidii' as a very distinct family of the Amphisba^nia. The ])resence of 
all the pelvic elements allies it to the Chirotidte rather than to the 
Amphisb;enida'. 

Since my examination of the osteology of this genus Dr. G. Baur has 
reexamined the subject ' and has added somewhat to our knowledge of 
it. He discovered the epipterygoid and the jugal, and finds a rudi- 
mentary pubis and ischium "which are united j)roximally," He 
states that " the j)ubis has an obturator foramen," but what this means 
is not explained. He alleges that my description is not correct, but he 
indicates no error except the omission of the elements mentioned. 
Some sutural lines were omitted from my figure, which are now 
inserted. 

But one genus of the Anniellidie is known, which has the following 
characters : 

Body vermiform ; no limbs. Eyes represented by a fissure; ears concealed. No pre- 
anal pores. Scales soft, cycloid-hexagonal, imbricate ; nostril in a single plate. 

Anniella Gray. 

There are some characters of the skeleton of the genus Anniella in 
which it differs from the known forms of Euchirotid;e and Amphis- 
bienida^, whose value is uncertain. These are: (1) The internal gom- 
phosis of the supraoccipital bone into the parietal; it is external in 
other Annulati. (2) The angular bone is chiefly exposed on the exter- 
nal side of the mandibular ramus. (3) There is no hypohyal process 
of the basihyal.

BouLENGER, Cat. Liz. Brit. Mus., 2d ed., II, 1885, p. 299. 

Body cylindrical, elongated, without limbs. No trace of lateral groove 
nor of external ear. Head very short; depressed; cleft of mouth 
ratlier short. A broad frontonasal plate in extensive contact with a 
fused frontal and frontoparietals. A small interparietal in a notch of 
the latter. Nasal in the center of a single plate which comes to the 
edge of jaw. Eye distinct, but closed by the oppressed inferior eyelid. 

The more detailed osteological characters are as follows. They are 
derived from specimens from San Diego, California, collected and pre- 
sented to me by my friend, Mr. James S. Lipi>incott. 

The premaxillary has an elongate spine, and the palatal suture pre- 
sents backward two concavities separated by a median projection. 
The nasals are distinct and rather short and wide. The frontals are 
distinct and rather wide. The parietal is very large every way, is 
single, and has no pineal foramen. The supraoccipital forms a close 
suture with it, sending forward a median process for internal gompho- 
sis, and an angle on each side of it. It is coossified with the exoccipital 
and is expanded to accommodate the large circle of the superior semi- 
circular canal. The facial plate of the maxillary is large. The pre- 
frontal is above the eye and is cut off from the parietal by an entrant 
angle of the frontal only. The lachrymal is small and is below and 
separated from the prefrontal. Jugals narrow, lying on the superior 
aspect of the maxillary, terminating freely. Postfrontal crescentic, 
bounded by both frontal and parietal. Postorbital a caducous scale 
lying in contact with the posterior limb of the i)ostfrontal. A supra- 
orbital bone external to the prefrontal. Petrosal with its superior 
border in close contact with the decurved lateral borders of the parie- 
tal, as in a snake. The latter do not, however, descend to the pre- 
sphenoid, but leave a wide fissure below it which deeply notches the 
anterior border of the petrosal. Supraforaminal part of pretrosal pro- 
duced to an acute angle, terminating at the parietal border much in 
advance of the anterior semicircular canal. Body of petrosal perfo- 
rated by a large foramen just in front of the superior part of the quad- 
rate. No parietoquadrate arch, but a posteroexternal angle of the 
parietal extending near to the proximal extremity of the quadrate. 
No distinct supratemporal or paroccipital.* Stapes with large disk 
and short, stout columella, with thickened tympanic extremity. Max- 
illopalatines continuous anteriorly, slightly divergent posteriorly; exca- 
vated by a deep groove posteriorly, which terminates in a fossa 
medially. The external borders of the posterior apices are turned out- 



' Baur states that the jiaroccipital is present, but I have not been able to find it

ward, so as to inclose partially the posterior uares below. The pala- 
tines are short, the groove separating the maxillary from the vomerine 
l^rocesses extending to the suture with the pterygoid, so that the max- 
illary process only appears as the inferior face of the bone. Ptery- 
goids elongated anteriorly, reaching to beyond the middle of the 
palatine foramen. They extend directly back to the quadrates, being 
well separated on the middle line, and abruptly notched on the inner 
side to receive the short, angular basipterygoids. They are separated 
from the sphenoids by a fissure, and are grooved on the inner side pos- 
terior to the basipterygoid. Ectopterygoids present, rather slender, 
inclosing rather large palatine foramina. Ej^ipterygoid small. Narial 
fissure overhung by the free edge of the maxillary and palatine bones. 
Sphenoid and basioccipital and exoccipital coossified. Occipital con- 
dyle convex and perfectly simple. 

The mandible has an open Meckelian groove, and the surangular and 
articular bones are coossified, while the angular and spleuial bones are 
distinct. The latter extends well anteriorly. The coronoid extends a 
little forward on the exterior face of the ramus and in both directions 
on the inner face. 

The hyoid apparatus is the most simple among lizards. It consists 
of a continuous cartilaginous glossobasihyal rod, which is bifurcated 
posteriorly, and a simple osseous first branchihyal attached to each of 
the branches. Other elements wanting. 

Ten cervical vertebra' with compressed inferior processes of the cen- 
tra, or hypapophyses. They are coossified with the centra and are not 
intercentral in position, hence it is not evident that they are inter- 
centra. No zygosi)hen. In the AnnicUa pulehra there are seventy- 
three rib-bearing vertebra' and two cervicals without ribs. The sacral 
and proximal caudal vertebne have diapophyses, those of the former 
little different from those of the latter. The fifth vertebra with a 
diapophysis supports a pair of parallel plates coossified with its infe- 
rior face like the chevron or double hypapophysis of a snake. In the 
succeeding vertebrae similar plates form the basis of a chevron, whose 
symphysis is turned rather abruptly posteriorly. The position of 
these chevrons is central and not intercentral. Caudal vertebne not 
segmented. 

Scapular arch wanting; pelvic arch medi ventral; no limbs. The 
ilium is represented by a small and short rod like bone, which is attached 
to the extremity of the diapophysis of a single vertebra. The proximal 
extremity is directed backward for a short distance posterior to the 
point of suspension, as in Aneli/tropsis. According to Baur, there is a 
rudimentary ischium and pubis, "which are united proximally." jSTo 
trace of posterior limb. Teeth simple, acutely conic. 

The hemipenis is not bifurcate. It is surrounded by transverse 
laminae or flounces, which are crimped so as to be slightly pocketed. 
The organ resembles that of Gerrhonotus.

X3. 

Cat. No. 16022, U.S.N.M. 

Body depressed cylindric >tail obtuse, about one-half as long as body, 
but varying somewhat in length. Scales smooth, everywhere equal, in 
generally thirty rows, but sometimes in twenty-eight and even twenty- 
six. Head but little wider than body posteriorly, contracting radially 
to an obtuse, moderately depressed muzzle, which projects beyond the 
lower jaw. Preanal scales generally larger than those which precede 
them, but not much. 

Rostral plate bounded posteriorly chiefly by the nasals, but also at 
the apex by the internasoloreal line, which have a short common suture 
on the middle line. Posterior to these there is a frontonasal, which is 
wider than long. Posterior to this is a large plate, probably composed 
of the fused frontal and frontoparietals. This is notched on the pos- 
terior border for a small interparietal. Posterior to these plates is a 
series of five smaller ones, of which two laterals on each side may be 
regarded as parietals, and the median an occipital. Posterior to these 
a few scales are larger than those of the body generally. 

There are six superior labials, of which the first is beneath the nasal 
and part of the rostral, and is very narrow. The second is the largest 
and is longer than high, and is bounded above by the loreointernasal 
and the first and second preoculars. The third, fourth, and fifth labials 
are higher than long, and the third and fourth reach the eye, unless cut 
off entirely (which it is always in great part) by the inferior preocular. 
Nasal triangular with the apex posterior, deeper than long. Nostril rela-

tively small. Superior preociilar long; inferior preocular quite small. 
Supraoculars two, the anterior larger than the superior preocular, and 
joining the posterior border of the frontonasal by a suture nearly equal 
to that with the frontal, and separated from the opposite supraocular 
by a space greater than its own width, but not twice as great. Three 
small superciliaries; two squamiform postoculars. 

Six inferior labials, which are subequal except the last two, which 
gradually diminish. A large symphyseal, which is as broad as long. 
It has two subequal facets on each side for the first labial and the first 
infralabial, the latter large, and meeting on the middle line. The 
remaining infralabials of the first series are three in number and are 
quite narrow. There is a second series of infralabials posterior to the 
first, consisting of three scales on each side. Those of the first pair 
are large, and are in contact on the middle line; the second is smaller 
and subtriangular, and the third is smallest and narrowest in form. 
The regular squamation begins posterior to these. 

The closed inferior eyelid is covered with three scales, of which the 
median is the largest. 

Preanal plates five, the median wedge-shaped, with the apex 
posterior. 

There are two color varieties as follows: 

Var. A, nigra: Upper half of body uniform dark purplish brown; 
beneath, yellowish white; scales slightly dotted with brown along 
their lateral edges, especially under the tail. Chin, throat, and across 
anal slit dusky [A. nigra Fischer). 

Var. B, pulvhra: Lighter with three dark lines; a dorsal and lateral. 
Sometimes with fainter lines on the adjacent edges of all the rows of 
scales; the ground color above yellowish gray or ash. 

Specimens from Monterey are uniform purplish brown above, yellow- 
ish white below. Cat. No. 3188, from San Francisco, is rather lighter, 
with three narrow dark lines, one on the middle of the back on the adja- 
cent edges of the two central rows of scales; the other on the adjacent 
edges of the fifth and sixth rows from the middle. Below this are some 
less distinct lines on the sides. Smaller specimens from San Diego 
have, in addition to these, fainter lines along the adjacent edges of 
every row of scales. 

The characters of this species are tolerably constant. In six speci- 
mens out of seventeen, 1 find the small preocular absent. The length 
of the tail in seven specimens varies from four-elevenths to one-third 
the total length. 

Br. J. G. Fischer' has described a specimen of Var. A as a dis- 
tinct species under the name of ^4.. nigra. Besides the color charac- 
ters, he finds it to differ in the shorter tail, and in the longer preanal 
scales. The tail in his specimen of A. nigra is one third the length, 
while in his single specimen of A. pulchr a it is two-fifths of the same.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



I have seen no example with the tail as long as the latter specimen, 
but a proportion of four-elevenths is met with alike in dark colored and 
pale individuals. The difference is not important. The length of the 
anal scales varies within the limits mentioned by Dr. Fischer. In some 
specimens these scales are a little longer than those in front of them, 
and in one pale example (Cat. No. 12555) they are twice as long. 

Dr. Boulenger describes^ a specimen said to come from El Paso, 
Texas, as the type of a distinct species which he calls A. texana. The 
characters which he gives are mainly those of the A. pulchra, but there 
are a few differences. Thus the nasal plate has a suture extending 
posteriorly from the nostril to the border, and the interparietal and 
occipital plates are divided by a longitudinal suture. The head is said 
to be less depressed and the snout more rounded than in the A.2)ulchra. 
The presence of the sutures above mentioned may be anomalous, 
but if the form of the head be essentially different from that of the 
A. pulchra they might be constant. I have never observed them in any 
specimen of the A. pulchra. Without figures it is ditficult to estimate 
the significance to be ascribed to the form of the muzzle. The locality 
will require verification, as it is out of the range of most of the Cali- 
fornian forms. We will await further information before forming an 
opinion as to the value of this form. 

This pretty species considerably resembles the "blind worm" of 
Europe in form and appearance, but has no affinity with it, represent- 
ing a different saurian phylum. Of its habits nothing is known. Its 
habitat is restricted to the Pacific district from San Francisco south- 
ward, including San Diego.

The following description is copied from Bonlenger: 

Head less depressed, snout more rounded . au in A. pulclir a. Nasal shield semi- 
divided, a horizontal suture extending from the nostril to the second labial; frontal 
twice as hroad as long; anterior supraocular nearly as broad as the distance which 
separates it from its fellow; interparietal and occipital divided (anomalously?) by 
a longitudinal suture; six upper labials — iirst very small, below the nasal, second 
largest and in contact with the prefrontal and a loreal, third and fourth entering 
the eye; a narrow shield separates the third labial from the loreal; five lower labi- 
als. Twenty-eight scales round the middle of the body. No enlarged preanal scales. 
Tail ending obtusely, three-eighths of the total length. Dark gray above with three 
fine black longitudinal lines; sides and lower surfaces whitish. 

From snout to vent, 145 mm. ; tail, 85 mm.

Parietal bones laterally decurved, and continuously united with 
petrosal by suture, and fused on the middle line, frontals inclosing 
olfactory lobes of the brain below. No cranial arches, vertebr* pro- 
co'lous; the cervicals with coossifled hyjiapophyses on the middles of 
the centra. Chevrons coossilied with the middle of the centra, the 
anterior without symphysis. 

The visceral characters are as follows: 

One lung, apparently the left, which lies ventrad of the alimentary 
canal. Liver situated mucli posterior to the heart, very elongate, dis- 
tally bilobate, the right lobe much longer than the left. Gall bladder 
situated in the notch between the lobes of the liver. Stomach not 
turned to the left; small intestine elongate, terminating in a large 
intestine which is imperfectly distinguished into colon and rectum. 
Kidneys i^osterior, symmetrical; a urinary bladder. Corpora adiposa 
jjresent, free. Ventral mesentery extending from heart to distal 
extremity of liver, hence elongate; dorsal mesentery following the pli- 
cations of the intestine and not binding them into a simple mesenteric 
pouch, as is seen in the Serpentes. 

Subordinate modifications are observable in different types. Thus, 
in AmpMsbama alba and A. fuUginosa there is a short ciecum, and 
the corpus adiposum is subdivided. In Rhinenra Jioridana there is no 
caicuni, and each corpus adiposum is undivided. 

This superfamily embraces the most snake-like of the Sauria. This 
aftinity is seen in most parts of their osseous structure, in the inclosure 
of the brain case by the frontal and parietal bones in connectiou with 
the petrosal, the absence of sui)ratemporal, the numerous coossilied 



678 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

hypapophyses of the cervical vertebrjp, and the open central chevrons of 
the caudals. The peculiar pelvic bone differs entirely from that which 
is seen in genera of Anguidte, which are equally without posterior limbs, 
and is only approached by that of the Anelytropidte among other liz- 
ards. It more nearly resembles a corresponding element in the perop- 
odous snakes, when a rudimental ilium and pes are also present, and 
the TyphlopidiB (Fiirbringer), where no rudiment of leg exists. Its 
nearest point of affinity to the other Sauria is seen in the Anelytropid^e. 
The contents of the superfamily includes four families, which fall 
into two groups, as follows : 

I. Scales present ; an eye-fissure ; tongue papillose; teeth pleurodont ; no limbs. 

Anniellid^. 

II. No distinct scales nor eye fissure; tongue scaly: 

Teeth pleurodont; anterior limbs Eijchikotid^. 

Teeth pleurodont; no limbs AMPHiSByENiD^E. 

Teeth acrodont ; no limbs Trogoxophid^. 

The above families agree in several characters not included in the 
above diagnosis of the superfamily. Thus, all have a single premaxil- 
lary, but double nasals and frontals. The premaxillary is in contact 
with the vomer. The articular and suraugular bones are united, while 
the angular is distinct. The coronoid bone has little horizontal extent 
on the external face of the ramus. 

All the forms are vermiform and of subterranean habits. 

Boulenger thinks that the Amphisboenidae are allied to the Teiidfc 
through such forms as Ophiognomon and Microdacfyhis. 1 have already 
pointed out the characters of this type under the Teiidae in descrfbing 
the anatomy of the genus Propus. There is nothing especially Amphis- 
bfenian other than what may be observed in serpentiform lizards of 
several families, althougii the external appearance of these Teiid forms 
is in favor of such a view. Anniella, the least typical of the Annulati, 
is nearer to the Diploglossa in the character of the tongue, and it is not 
unlikely that it is to this group after the Annulati that it is most nearly 
allied, as remarked by Boulenger in the Catalogue of Lizards of the 
British Museum. 

EUCHIROTID^. 

Chirotida! Gray, Cat. Tort., Amphisb., Brit. Mus., 1844. 
Three genera of this family are known as follows: 

Digits, five ; all clawed Euchirotes Cope. 

Digits, five ; one smaller and clawless Bipes Lacepide. 

Digits, three; clawed Hemichiroies Duges. 

Each of these genera includes a single species, which is character- 
ized as follows: 

Euchirotes biporns Cope. Tail twice as long as head; anus preceded 
by a transverse series of six large plates, which extend to the abdomi- 
nal scuta; a single preanal pore each in a single scale in front of the 
external preanal plate. Nasal plates nearly in contact in front. Cape

The characters of the scap- 
ular and pelvic arches in this 
genus are as follows: 

Scapular and pelvic arch present; fore limbs, but no hind limbs. 

Scapular arch. — For the first time in the history of scapular reduc- 
tion we find the clavicle absent. No iuterclavicle nor precoracoid. 
Supraclavicle osseous. Clavicle and coracoid osseous, coossified; no 
coracoid cartilage. Sternum without costals, osseous, pentagonal, and 
with a long xiphoid process. Ulna and radius well distinguished. 

Pelvic arch. — An elongate element on each side, directed downward 
and a little forward, principally ilium, but with a short free distal 
extremity, which represents one or both of the inferior elements. A 
short curved cartilage represents the femur. The ilium is connected 
by a cartilage with the extremity of a single diapophysis, and a short 
free segment corresponding to this cartilage articulates with the ver- 
tebra whi(!h follows. 

The scapular arch of Bipes canaliculatus Lac.«^pMe has been described 
and figured byMiiller,' andbyDumeril and Bibron,^ both with omission 
of pelvic arch. The description and figure which I gave^ as referring 
to that species, was really taken from the Euchirotes bijmrus^ of the 
distinctness of which I was not at that time aware. Miiller says of 
tlie former species "that the clavicle and scapula are fused into a 
single piece." This is probably an error, as there is apparently no 
clavicle, as may be seen by comparing the figures given in the present 
paper. Neither Miiller nor Dumeril and Bibron detected the rudi- 
mental pelvic arch. Before I was aware of the difference between

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



Bijyes aud Euchirotes I thought this statement might have been due to 
badly preserved specimens, but it is quite possible that the two 
genera may diSer in this respect. 

In the Uuchirotes hiporus the liver is situated far caudal to the heart. 
Both extremities are bilobate, the caudal extremity unequally, as the 
right lobe is much produced. It is separated from the left by a deep 
fissure, and the gall bladder is exposed on the left side, and it is not 
inclosed as in Auguidiie. The trachea passes above the heart to a 
point a short distance beyond it, where, without dividing, it enters a 
single biauriculate lung. The lung lies entirely ventrad of the gut, and 
extends along the left side of the liver part of its length. The heart is 
halfway Jjet ween the end of the muzzle aud the caudal end of the liver. 

The intestine presents two expansions proximad to the large intes- 
tine. The moderate constriction divides the latter into colon and sec- 
tion, and the former has a proximal caecum. The corpora adiposa are 
large. The transverse section of the liver is crescentic. It is sup- 
ported by a gastrohepatic mesentery, and a sheet on the right, which, 
as it arises from the hepatic border, may be a hepatolateral, but which is 
probably homologous with the right hepatic of other Annulati. A left 
gastropulmouary sheet. Hepatoventral single.

The snout is short, rounded, and very convex. The limbs are very 
broad and short, with five perfect clawed digits. The larger head 
plates are a rostral, three labials, a nasal, an ocular, a preocular, two 
suboculars, one sui)raocular, a very large undivided prefrontal, and a

pair of froiitals. There are also two small plates between the third 
labial and the suboculars. The anus is preceded by a transverse series 
of six longitudinal plates. There is a single preanal pore in a large 
plate in front of the external i^reanal plate of each side. 

Measurements. — Total length, 199 mm.; limb, 8 mm.; tail, 18 mm.; 
head, 7 mm. 

Kostral plate triangular, the apex touching the interuasal. The 
latter is twice as wide as long, and the frontals are wider than long. 
The nasal is subtriangular, with an obtuse apex directed posteriorly. 
The nostril is anterior to the center. The lirst superior labial is as 
long as the two others together. The symphyseal is large and is suc- 
ceeded by four inferior labials; the first largest, the second interme- 
diate, and the third and fourth subquadrate much smaller. A large 
postmental longer than wide, which is bounded in front on each side 
by the first labial and for the greater part by a large infralabial, which 
separates it from the second labial. A band of fourteen scales between 
the angles of the mouth below and eighteen above. 

The dorsal and abdominal scales are separated by a longitudinal 
groove which extends to the anus. The abdominal scales are about 
twice as long as the dorsals, one row answering to two of the latter, 
with an occasional opposition of the extremities of single rows as an 
exception. There are twenty-four rectangular divisions of each abdom- 
inal cross band, the terminal ones small and subtrangular. In a dorsal 
cross band there are twenty-nine transverse divisions. On the thoracic 
region the bands are interrupted on the middle line, alternating with 
each other and forming chevrons directed forward. The last gular 
band is short and convex posteriorly. The number of the bands is as 
follows: Gular, 7; thoracic, 4; abdominal, 138; caudal, 20. A few of 
of the caiulal may be alternate on the middle line. The preanal plates 
are unequal, the median pair being much the largest. The next 
external are nearly as long and are very narrow; the third or external 
pair one-half the size of the second. In front of it is a larger scale 
leaving the pore in its posterior region, and external to the latter are 
two small scales. 

The fore limbs are annulate, with scales like those of the belly, in 
six bands, from shoulder to digits. Digits I, II, and III equal and 
two-fifths the length of the arm; IV shorter, and Y shortest. 

Measurements (Cat. No. 21325).— Total length, 202 mm. ; total length 
of head to angle of mouth, 5 mm. ; total length of tail, 20 mm. ; total 
length of fore limb, 7.o mm.

Dr. Boulenger gives the following description of this family : 

Tongue moderately elongate, arrowheaded, covered with imbricate, scale-like 
papillae, ending in two long, narrow, smooth points. Teeth large, few, anchylosed 
to the inner edge of the jaws ; prsemaxillary teeth usually in odd n amber ; no ptery- 
goid teeth. Skull thick, strongly ossitied, without interorbital septum, or colu- 
mella cranii, or jjostorbital, or supratemporal arches; premaxillary single; nasals 
two ; frontals two ; parietal single, very large ; an orbitosphenoid bone ; quadratum 
very oblique or nearly horizontal, owing to the shortness of the postcoronoid part 
of the mandible; occipital condyle frequently divided. Vertebne very numerous, 
depressed, all except the foremost without spinous processes. Pectoral arch imper- 
fectly developed in Chirotes, reduced to minute rudiments in the other (limbless) 
forms; pelvic arch reduced to minute rudiments. Worm-like, adapted to subter- 
ranean life; eyes concealed under the skin; mouth small, frequently inferior; no 
ear. Head covered with symmetrical plates ; skin divided into soft, squarish -seg- 
ments, forming regular annuli. Tail short. 

The shape of the skull varies considerably, according to the genera; in this re- 
spect Blanus appears to be least specialized, although the occipital condyle is divided, 
while it remains single (kidney shaped when seen posteriorly) in the otherwise more 
specialized Acrodonta. The mandible especially undergoes the greatest modifica- 
tions, as may be seen from Gervais and Peters's accounts of Blanus, Amphisiauia, 
Lepidosternmn, and Monopeltis. The angular bone is chiefly developed on the inter- 
nal side of the ramus, and the splenial is very small. The coronoid is large and 
subtriangular, and is overlapped from behind by the surangular on the external face 
of the ramus. Meckel's groove is closed. The columella auris is robust. The paroc- 
cipital is present as a scale just above the quadrate. 

All the members of this family are burrowers, and many live in ants' nests. 
They bore narrow galleries in the earth, in which they are able to progress back- 
ward as well as forward. On the ground they progress on a straight line, by slight 
vertical undulations, not by lateral movements, as in other limbless reptiles; the 
tail of many species seems to be more or less prehensile. The food of these lizards 
consists of small insects and worms. Little has been published on their habits, and 
all that is known of their mode of parturition is that Anops kimjii is oviparous, and 
deposits its ova in ants' nests. 

As many as sixty-one species are enumerated by Boulenger in the 
Catalogue of the British Museum; thirty-eight are American, out of 
which only one, Bliinenra floHdana, occurs north of the Tropic of 
Cancer, and four {Amphisbwna and Diphalus) in the West Indies. The

tvrenty-three other species inhabit Africa, with the exception of the 
three species of the genera Blanus, which belong to the Mediterranean 
district.

Anatomy. — The characters of the regions of the arches and limbs have 
the following characters in Amphishcvna occidentalis Cope: 

No scapular arch nor limbs ; a rudimental pelvic arch. 

Felvic arch. — This consists, in this species, of a slender bone in the 
abdominal wall, a little in front of the vent on each side, which is 
directed forward and inward, but without meefing its mate on the 
middle line. It has no articular connection with any other element. 
In AvipJdsbcena alba this element is similar, but is relatively shorter 
and more as figured by Fiirbringer in the A.fuliginosa. This species 
has also, according to Fiirbringer, a very rudimental scapula. 

As the left lung only is present in this family, there is but one gas- 
tropulmonary mesentery. The liver has a cresceutic cross section, and 
it is sup])orted by two gastrohei)atic mesenteries {Anq)hisba'na alba 
and A./Hliginofia), or by only one, and a right hepatic, or hepatolateral, 
as it may be {Rhineura floridana). There is but one hepatoventral. 

The onlj" species of which I have obtained a satisfactory hemipenis is 
the African Moiwpeltis galeatus Ilallowell. The organ is bifurcate ; each 
branch is marked with fine, close, transverse folds, while the region 
proximad of these has coarser folds directed transversely and obliquely. 

Origin. — No information as to the origin of the Amphisba^nidie or ot 
the Annulati was accessible until Dr. Baur in 1893 ^ announced the 
discovery of two species in the Oligocene beds of South Dakota, where

skulls were found by Mr. J. B. Hatcher, of the Princeton exploring 
expedition. These crania represent two genera, Rhineura Cope, still 
existing, and Hypsorhina Baur, extinct, and both are more nearly allied 
to Lejmlosternum than to Amphisbwna. The species are termed R. 
hatcherii and H. antiqua. 

This interesting discovery explains the existence of Rhineura in 
Florida, and relieves us of the necessity of supposing an immigration 
of Lepidosternoid reptiles from the South American continent, a 
hypothesis which is the more difficult to sustain, since there are no 
Amphisbsenidfe in Mexico or the West Indies. 

RHINEURA Cope. 

Bhineura Cope, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1861, p. 75'.— Boulenger, Cat. Liz. 
Brit. Mu8., II, 1885, p. 459. 

Body vermiform, without legs, no ears, and the eyes invisible. Body 
encircled by a succession of continuous whorls, divided into square 
plates. Pectoral plates rather larger than elsewhere. Teeth conical, 
distant, pleurodont, none on the palatine. Tongue fleshy, narrow, ovate, 
emargiuate behind and slightly bifiid anteriorly; attached except at 
the tip. Tail flat, with tubercles in transverse series. Nostril pierced 
in a distinct nasal plate. 

Osteolof/y. — A specimen of the R. floridana Baird from Volusia, Flor- 
ida, furnishes the characters of the skeleton. 

The alveolar border of the premaxillary is very short, and supi)ort8 
only one, a median tooth. The spine is divided into two portions, that 
below the projecting angle of the muzzle and that above it. The former 
is contracted a little by a process of the maxillary which enters from the 
alveolar portion, separating it from the nostril, which is inferior in posi- 
tion. It then expands a little, to form on the upper side of the muzzle 
a terminal expansion twice as wide as long. The nasals are distinct, 
and extend to the border of the muzzle, overroofing the nostrils. Fron- 
tals wide, distinct, deeply emargiuate posteriorly for the parietal. Pre- 
frontal rather large, triangular, sending its apex posteriorly over the 
orbit and reaching the parietal. Its free border and a narrow band of 
the parietal form a crista temporalis, which do not unite on the middle 
line into a crista sagittalis. Parietal single, without pineal foramen, 
continuous laterally with the petrosal and alisphenoid, and posteriorly 
with the supraoccipital, from which it receives on the middle line a 
gomi)hosis. Supraoccipital bounding foramen magnum, of which it 
forms a rather narrow border. A small triangular bone at the extrem- 
ity of the maxillary may be a jugal or a lachrymal. The alisphenoid 
and petrosal form the inferior part of the side walls of the brain case, 
and are separated from the pterygoids and presphenoid below them by 
a narrow fissure M^hich is widest below the petrosal. The latter sends 
an angle upward and backward between the parietal and exoccipital. 
The exoccipital sends a prolongation (paroccipital?) downward and for-

ward, which gives articulation to the quadrate, bounding the fenestra 
ovalis above. The latter is large and is closed by the large disk of the 
stapes. The quadrate has no posterior proximal process, and is oblic^ue 
proximally, but is nu)re nearly vertical distally. In its i)Osterior angle 
rests the club-shaped head of the robust columella auris. 

The vomer presents at its auterior extremity a process which separates 
a transverse process frou) each maxillary, and enters a not<;h in the 
posterior border of the premaxillary. The vomers are jilane in front, 
but become convex and separated by a fissure posteriorly, ending each 
in an acuminate apex lying on the presphenoid. The palatine is nar- 
row and lies along the inner side of the ectopterygoid, consisting chiefly 
of its maxillary process; it is doubtful whether it possesses a vomerine 
process. Posteriorly it lies scale-like on the pterygoid, reaching nearly 
to the line of the quadrate. The narial fissure is nearly closed anteriorly, 
except a foramen-like portion at the anterior extremity. The presphe- 
noid, sphenoid, and basioccipital are coossified. To these the pterygoid 
is closely appressed by the one side, while on the outer side the latter 
carries the narrow splint-like ectopterygoid as far as the maxillary. 
No palatine foramen. Occipital condyle simple, transverse, medially 
concave. 

The mandible displays noMeckelian groove, and the splenial is small. 
The small angular is only visible on the in ternal side of the ramus. Sur- 
angular and articular confluent. Coronoid large, triangular, not concave 
below, and overlaid at base externally by anterior extremity of surangu- 
lar; anteriorly not extended over dentary. Angle short, longer than 
wide, a little inflected, simple; its plane an angle of 45 degrees to that 
of the ramus. 

The hyoid apparatus is very simple. It consists of a glossobasihyal 
cartilage which is deeply bifurcate posteriorly. At the posterior extrem- 
ity each posterior limb sends a process forward, which is about half as 
long as the antei'ior elements, the hypohyal. Xo ceratohyal nor second 
ceratobrancliial. A rather short and simple osseous flrst ceratobran- 
chial on each side. 

The vertebral column consists of manycervico-dorsals and a relatively 
small number of caudals. The second vertebra has a strong keel-like 
hypapophysis, which is also strong on the third, but which diminishes 
from that point so that on the sixth it is no longer perceptible. The 
first rib is short and is attached to the third vertebra. Diapophyses 
and neural spines very short. The ribs do not disi)lay a vertical process 
at the head as in Lepidosternum octostegum. Diapophyses very short 
and simple on caudal vertebrae. Caudal hypapophyses beginning on the 
anterior fourth of the caudal series, the halves at first widely sepa- 
rated. They soon converge downward, and finally touch, but are never 
coossified to form a chevron. Position on the middle of the length of 
the centrum. Rib-bearing vertebra' without trace of zygosphen. 

Scapular arch absent. Pelvic arch represented by a single curved

rod on each side of and anterior to the vent, which is connected with 
the extremities of two ribs by ligament only. This is the ileopectiueal 
bone of Fiirbringer. No trace of posterior limb. 

Teeth simple, conic; situated on premaxillary, maxillary, and dentary 
bones only. Premaxillary with but one, a median tooth. 

The genus Lepidosternnm, as typified by the L. octostegmn, differs 
from Rhineura in that the nasal bones are excluded from the narial 
borders by the maxillary, and from contact with each other by the pro- 
longed si)ine of the premaxillary. In both of these points Rhineura 
agrees with Amphisbcvna. In Lepidosternum also there is a Meckelian 
groove, and the angle is turned vertically downward. In Amphishcena 
(fuliginosa) there is a groove and no angle.

Body as thick as a large goose quill or larger. A large pentagonal 
plate on top of the head, encircled by nine others; the rostrum ending 
in a broad horizontal crescent overhanging the mouth. No ears. Tail 
one eighteenth the body ; much depressed ; its upper surface with the 
whorls covered by large tubercles set in smaller ones instead of by 
square flat plates. 

Color yellowish white; in spirits; rose colored in life. 

Body resembling somewhat a large Ascam, white worm, in its uniform 
yellowish white color, absence of limbs, ears, aiul eyes, and succession 
of rings encircling it from head to tail. The head is contained about 
thirty-three times in the head and body and twice in the tail. It is 
ovoidal above, much depressed, the rostrum broad and i)rojecting con- 
siderably beyond the lower jaw both terminally and laterally. A broad 
cresceutic plate forms the tip of the rostrum. This may possibly be the 
frontal plate. Beneath this i)late is a rostral which connects it with

the opening of the mouth, and on each side of this are three labials 
(four on one side) which become successively larger, the posterior as 
large as all the rest. Above the anterior of these are two other plates. 
On one side of the rostral plate, and above the first labial, is one with 
a nasal perforation in the center; but there is none corresponding to it 
on the other. Behind the terminal plate of the muzzle is a median one- 
half its width (vertical?), and behind this another (occipital?) as wide 
as the first. This is subpentagonal, with two large plates in front con- 
necting it to the terminal one and separated by the second median 
plate described. On each side of this i^late are two, the anterior very 
small, and with another immediately below it. This largest central 
plate is thus encircled by nine plates — three anterior, four posterior, 
and two lateral. The entire head, exclusive of the lower jaw, has about 
forty plates. The teeth are long, conical, recurved, and distant. There 
are about three on each side of each Jaw. 

There are four labials on each side the median mental, which has 
another plate behind it, followed by two long narrow ones. A long 
plate against the inner labials connects anteriorly with the latter. 

The body is encircled by a ouccession of whorls or rings of close 
square plates, about thirty in number. These are narrower above and 
broader below on the pectoral region (for about six whorls) than else- 
where. There is a distinct groove or furrow along the back, with an 
occasional tubercle in it. One in the ventral surface is ranch less dis- 
tinct. The tail is short, contained about seventeen or eighteen times 
in head and body. It is much depressed and rounded at the tip; 
verticillate, but the plates on the upper surface, except anteriorly, are 
tubercular, rounded and raised, set in the midst of smaller ones. There 
are fifteen caudal whorls on the under surface. 

This very curious saurian form was first introduced into the North 
American fauna by Dr. Barratt, who found it at Micanopy, Florida, 
where it is said to be not uncommon, and to be frecjuently ploughed up 
in the ])otato patches. It is probably entirely subterranean in its 
mode of life. It has been since found in nearly all parts of the Floridan 
zoological district. Living specimens sent me by Mr. C. B. Moore are 
of a beautiful rose-purple color with a milky bloom, such as is seen on 
some fruits. Three distinct imrple stripes radiate from the head pos- 
teriorly, but are soon lost in the surrounding color. 

The specimens were sent me in damp sand, in which they burrowed 
and remained concealed. Unfortunately they lived but a short time, 
and a second sending met the same fate.

but three genera, and these are confined to the Old World. They 
differ as follows : 

No preanal pores ; two pairs of upper bead sbields ; nostril pierced in a nasal. 

Trogonophis Kaup. 
Preanal pores; tbree large npper bead sbields besides the rostral; nostril pierced 

between two nasals Pachy calamus Giinther. 

Preanal pores; a single large upper head shield; nostril pierced in a nasal. 

Agamodon Peters. 

Trogonophis has but one species, which is found in northwest Africa. 
Pachy calamus has a single species, which is an inhabitant of the island 
of Socotra, off the coast of east Africa. The only species of Agamo- 
don is east African. 

SERPENTES. 

I. ANATOMY. 



THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 

There is much uniformity in the characters of the skeleton in the 
Serpentes. Peculiarities characterize the principal divisions, but no 
definite grouiis can be traced in the great mass of the harmless snakes, 
so far as the skeleton is concerned. 

Slcull. — The ijremaxillary bone is connected with the skull by only 
its superior and inferior spines in all snakes excejit the Scolecophidia, 
where it is connected by suture laterally and iuferiorly with the ethmoid 
also, and in the Epanodonta with the maxillary. In other snakes the 
ethmoid lies above its inferior spine. The nasals are always distinct 
from each other, except in Charina, where they are coossified. They 
are also free laterally, except in Scolecophidia, Tortricina, and 
many peropodous genera, where they are suturally united posteriorly 
and laterally with the i)refrontals. Such are the genera Loxocemus, 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 689 

Liehanura, Charina, and Uryx, and to tbese must be added Xenopeltis. 
The frontals are always distinct and the parietals are always united. 
The supraoccipital never enters the foramen magnum, which is 
bounded above by the exoccipitals. The prefrontals are articulated 
above with the frontals and, in the divisions above named, Yvith the 
nasals also. The postfrontals are present, but are small and easily lost 
in preparing crania in some types. They are generally well developed, 
but are small in TAehamira and Cylindrophis, and are wanting in Xeno- 
peltis, Charina, Ilysia, the Scolecophidia, and the Elapidw. They are 
elongate and extended forward over the orbit to the prefrontals in 
AchrochordidsB and Nothopidae. There is a supraorbital bone in the 
rythonidrt\ The paroccipital is included in the cranial walls in all 
angiostomatous snakes, and is excluded from the brain case, lying 
scale-like on the surface, in the eurystomatous families. It is short in 
burrowing snakes, but elongates in other families, reaching an extreme 
length in the solenoglyphous division. The maxillary bone is loosely 
attached in Serpentes, having a close articulation with the prefrontal 
only, except in the Epauodonta, where it is fixed firmly to the premax- 
illary and vomers, as in lizards. It is shortened anteriorly in the Pro- 
teroglypha, and both anteriorly and posteriorly in the Solenog]yi>ha, so 
as to become snbvertical. Among the latter it is solid in all except the 
Crotalidie, where it is deeply excavated by a fossa postero-exteriorly. 
In the 0])oterodonta the maxillary is also very short and triangular, 
articulating very loosely with the prefrontal with its narrow apex. In 
snakes there are no lachrymal nor jugal bones. In proportion as the 
maxillary is abbreviated posteriorly, is the ectopterygoid elongated. 
The latter is generally a simple element, but in certain Najid genera it 
is deeply bifurcate anteriorly, according to Boulenger. 

The lateral walls of the brain case consist apparently of the frontal, 
parietal, and jietrosal bones, which articulate below with the presphe- 
noid, sphenoid, and basioccii^ital elements. At the base of the orbital 
wall of the frontal is a longitudinal groove, bounded below by the pre- 
sphenoid, which is occupied by the more or less persistent trabecula 
cranii. The optic foramen is large, and becomes a vacuity in types 
with large eyes, as Bascaniiim, and according to Boulenger those of 
opposite sides are confluent in PsammopMs. The trigeminus foramen 
is represented l)y two, which communicate beneath a long bridge in all 
snakes, including Typhlops {Olauconia not examined). The (luadrate 
bone presents some diversities of form, but none of great importance. 
In Ti/phlopfi it is short and flat, and presents a free angular process 
anteriorly. In Glaiiconia. it is long and slender, and has no anterior 
process. In the Tortricina it is very short, and has in the Ilysiidie a 
cylindric shaft. In Asinea it is generally flat and expanded at the 
proximal end, and has no angular process of the shaft, but in Eryx it 
is not expanded, and has a triangular section. In Xcnopcltis it is short, 
and has a short posterior projection proximally, as in lizards. In the

boas and pythons it has a short anterior process on the inner side with 
which the columella auris articulates. The process is very short in 
Eryx, and an articular facet only remains in Loxocemus, Lichanura, and 
Charina. In the venomous snakes it is so elongate as to articulate 
with the superior disk of the paroccipital, extending to the inner border 
in the Solenoglypha. 

The base of the skull presents certain diversities in the more distinct 
suborders. 

There is much difference as to the extent to which the free edges of 
the presphenoid extend outside of the trabecular grooves, concealing 
them from view from, below, or whether they are angulate or not. In 
some genera the basioccipital supports one to three hypapophyses for 
muscular irssertion, and in a few genera the sphenoid bone supports basi- 
pterygoid processes or tuberosities, accompanied or not with a median 
keel. In Solenoglypha the long median simple hypapophysis is con- 
stantly present, and in the Peropoda there are nearly always basi- 
pterygoids. Beyond this these characters are specific only, or connected 
with the size and vigor of the individual. The following table will 
show this :

The palatine bones differ considerably in the principal forms. The 
characters are seen in the presence or absence of the external (maxil- 
lary) or internal (vomerine) processes. These may be tabulated as 
follows: 

I. Internal and external processes present. Colubridse, Xenapeltidae, 
Charina, Python (the internal small), Glanconia. 

II. External process, but no internal. Boa, Eryx, Loxocemus, 
Lichanura.

IV. Neither internal nor external processes. Hydrophis, Causus, 
Vipera, Ancistrodon, Crotalophorus, Crotalus. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 691 

In all genera the ])alatine bono is longitudinal and compressed except 
in the Scolecophidia, where it is so short as to be transverse. The 
pterygoids are elongate and extend to the quadrate except in the 
Scolecophidia. In the Opoterodonta they are cyliudric, and extend 
beyond the quadrate, while in the Epanodonta they are flattened and 
do not quite reach the latter. They are generally compressed so as to 
present a vertical lamina, but in peropodous genera, especially in those 
with basipterygoid processes, they are expanded inward so as to be 
horizontal. They are also horizontal in Xenopeltis. The compressed 
form is related to the greatest mobility, and is hence most developed 
in the Solenogiypha. Ectopterygoids are present in all the super- 
families except the Scolecophidia. They are longest where the maxil- 
laries are shortest, that is, in the Solenoglypha. 

The mandible in Serpentes always lacks the surangular bone, and 
the angular is small and far anterior to the angle of the jaw, which is 
formed by the articular. The coronoid is absent, excepting in the Scole- 
cophidia, Tortricina, and Peropoda, except Charina, where it is want- 
ing. The splenial is always present, and is internal exclusively, except 
in Typhlops, where it is more extensively developed on the external than 
on the internal side, leaving the dentary but a narrow strip. In Ti/ph- 
lojjs also the angular is a very small splint, between the splenial and 
the base of the coronoid on the external side of the jaw. The Meckel- 
ian groove is open in many snakes, and in others it is closed by the 
apposition of the edges <^»f the dentary and splenial bones. In some 
species it is open only for a short distance. It is open in Crotalidai, 
Yiperid;e, and Hydrophida-, and in Ilysiida', Boidie, Pythonida?, Chari 
nidii', and Xenopeltida?. It is also open in the following genera of 
Colubrid*: Natrix, Eiitfcnia, Heterodon, Coluber^ Ophiholus^ Dlailophis, 
Cycloj/his, Liopeltis, Salvadora, Rhinochilus, Haldea^ Virginia, Storeria^ 
Ahastor and Farancia. In Osceola it is partly open; while it is closed 
in T}iphlops, Elaps, Causns, Sibon, Spilotes, Bascanium, and Carpho- 
phiops. Thus the open groove is ijrobably characteristic of Crotalidoe, 
Yiperida', Hydrophidce, the Peropoda, and the Ilomalopsinae. Further 
than this no definite boundaries can be yet traced by it. 

THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM. 

The teeth of snakes are not furnished with roots, and are not sunk 
in alv^eoli, but their bases are coossitied with the bones which bound 
the mouth. They have simple, acutely conic crowns with an oval sec- 
tion, sometimes with a sharp angle posteriorly when a cutting edge is 
present. In certain genera (Opisthogly]>ha) there is a groove on the 
anterior or external face {Ogmii(s) of the posterior one or two teeth of 
the maxillary bone. In one genus all the maxillary teeth are grooved 
(Ogmodon); while in the venomous species it is the anterior teeth 
which have undergone modification. In the Proteroglypha the anterior 
tooth is deeply grooved on the anterior face, and the edges of the 
groove have grown forward and inward so as to be in contact, thus 



692 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

iuclosiug a tube. In the Soleuoglypha tbis union has become complete 
fusion so that no trace of the primitive groove remains, altliough it is 
distinct in individuals at birth. The foramen at the anterior base of 
this tooth in Proteroglyplia and Solenoglyplia receives the i)apilliform 
extremity of the etferent duct of the salivary poison gland, and thus 
conducts the poison to the slit-like opening at the front apex of the 
crown. 

The tongue is long and cylindric, and is retractile into a sheath 
which opens in the anterior part of the floor of the mouth immediately 
in front of the glottis. Its free extremity is deeply bifurcate. It is 
the only tactile organ of the Serpentes. 

The alimentary canal is elongate, and the stomach is a simple enlarge- 
ment of its diameter, without transverse curvature. It passes gradu- 
ally into the small intestine, which is more or less convoluted by short 
turns which adhere together and are inclosed in a common peritoneal 
fold, which does not follow the convolutions, as is the case in Sauria 
and other Yertebrata. The rectum is straight, of enlarged diameter, 
and of variable length. It is separated from the small intestine by a 
muscular constriction, which is passed at one side by a narrow commu- 
nicating tube, which frequently leaves a rectal ctecum at one side. 
The walls of the stomach are often thickened, while those of the small 
intestine are variable, and are frequently densely papillose. The rec- 
tum presents a variety of internal structure. Its internal wall is 
smooth in Eunectes murinus, Eryx thebaicus, and Gylindrophis riifa. It 
has longitudinal plicas in Ilysia scyfale, Coluber obsoletnSj Gommosoma 
corais, Zamenis Jiagelliim, Katrix taxispilotiis, Honialopsis lencobalia, 
Hydrophis striata. With longitudinal folds there are transverse ones 
more or less developed in OpMbolus polyzonus, Malpolon lacertinnm^ 
Bryophis prasina, Ghersydrus granulatus. There are free transverse 
folds more or less developed in Leptognathus fasciata, Dipsas dendro- 
phila, Oxybelis acuminata^ Vipera ammodytes^ Grotalus durissus. The 
rectum is divided by transverse septa, with a perforation median or 
lateral, in Python spilotis, Farancia abacura^ Boodon geometricus, Elaps 
surinamensis, Bungarus sp., Ancistrodon contortrix. 

The salivary glands are labial or external to the maxillary and man- 
dibular bones, and have numerous efierent ducts. In opisthoglyph 
snakes that portion of them which is opposite the posterior maxillary 
teeth is enlarged, and the secretion is discharged at the bases of the 
grooves of the teeth. In proteroglyph and solenoglyph snakes tbis 
gland is still further developed, and fills the space between the orbit 
and quadrate bones. Its efiferent duct extends as a tube along the 
superior surface of the maxillary bone. In the genus Gausus this gland 
is greatly elongate, extending posteriorly above the ribs for one sixth 
the length of the animal (Reinhardt). In the Elapid genus AdeniopJiis 
the gland is restricted to a position corresponding to the posterior 
extremity of that of Gausm, and has in consequence an efferent duct 
of extraordinary length (Meyer). In these types a portion of the tern- 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 693 

poial muscle extends over the poison glaud and compresses it when 
the mouth is opened. In the venomous groups the anterior glands are 
reduced. Besides the labial glands there is a gland anterior to the 
prefrontal region, between the maxillary and nasal bones. The liver 
is long and narrow, and is on the right side of the alimentary canal, 
and begins immediately i)osterior to the heart or at various distances 
posterior to it, according to the genus. Thus it is near the heart in 
species of robust form, as the Viperidne and Crotalid;e, and in such 
genera as Xenodon and Heterodon. It is far removed in the Tortricina, 
Epanodouta, and Catodonta. It is exceptionally short in Chersydrns. 
Its distal extremity is bilobate, and the left lobe extends beyond the 
right. From between the two issues the cystic duct, which extends to 
and along the alimentarj^ canal to the position of the gall bladder. This 
stiucture is remarkable in Serpentesfor its distance from the liver. It 
is near to the spleen, which is adherent to the alimentary canal on its 
inferior side, and is of a subround form. The pancreas, which is of 
more elongate form but of relatively small size, is located near the 
spleen on the left side of the alimentary canal. 

THE CIRCULATORV SYSTEM. 

The disposition of the parts of the circulatory system in the Serpentes 
is dependent in large degree on the elongate form of these animals 
and on the arrangement of their respiratory organs. 

Although the heart is situated cephalad of the posttracheal lung, 
its position is posterior to that which it occupies in the Sauria. In 
CltcKsydnis it is situated at about the middle of the length of the body, 
but in the Matrices it is at the anterior fifth of the length. It is of 
rather elongate form, and its chambers are compactly adherent, and it 
is inclosed in a tough pericardial sac. In adult snakes there is but one 
aorta root on each side, of which the left is the most robust. The com- 
mon pulmonary trunk is distinct from the truncus arteriosus to the base. 
It was first observed by tSchlemm^ that in typical Colubroidea there 
is but one pulmonary artery, while in the Peropoda there are two. He 
also observed that where there is a tracheal lung there is an anterior 
pulmonary artery, as in Vipera herns, while in Lachesis mutus there are 
two. In Thrasops flarir/idaris, where the trachea is expanded trans- 
versely to the size of a tracheal lung, I have observed that there is 
an anterior pulmonary artery. There is generally a single carotid 
arteiy, which arises from the right aorta root. This may branch into 
two carotids, and in a few instances these carotids maintain their dis- 
tinctness to the aorta root. The right aorta root also gives forth an 
anterior artery, the arteria vertebral is of Ouvier, which supplies the 
intercostal arteries. It extends along the right side of the vertebral 
column, or divides, each half running on one side of the column. The 
coeliac artery is divided into several. The mesenteric is represented 
by two trunks which leave the aorta at a considerable distance apart.

694 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

The ophthalmic artery is divided from the facial, according to Eathke^ 
excepting in the Peropoda and Angiostomata, where it rises from the 
arteria cerebralis. The latter is the primitive fcetal connection in all 
snakes. 

The cardinal veins are unimportant in the Serpentes, the posterior 
vena cava having taken their place. This vessel originates at the 
kidneys, being formed by the successive union of numerous venw renales 
revehcntes, and extends to the liver. It runs in a groove of the superior 
side of this organ, and receives veme hepaticw along its course, and then 
passing above the heart enters the sinus venosus on the right side of 
the right auricle. Authors differ in their accounts of the origin of the 
vena cava. Schlemm states that it is formed by the union of two 
branches, one from each kidney, while Stannius states that it is derived 
from the right kidney only. In an anaconda {Eunectes murinus) 1 traced 
it easily from the right kidney, but was not successful in following the 
left renalis revehens to a junction with the right, though I can not 
assert that none exists. I found the junction to be near the left testis 
in a Coluber quadrivittatus. The kidneys receive each a vein which cor- 
responds to the vena iliaca of the Sauria, which are derived from a 
single vena caudalis. In Chersydrus there is a second large vessel run- 
ning from the liver to the heart, which may be a vena hepatica. 

The anterior caudal diapophyses of the Serpentes are bifurcate in a 
vertical plane. Between these branches are placed the lymphatics, 
which empty by a small vein into the vena iliaca. The thymus gland is a 
small elongate body lying near each carotid on each side, and near the 
heart. The thyroid gland is near the auricles of the heart on the middle 
line. Suprarenal bodies are present near the testis or ovaries, lying 
along the venw renales revehentes. 

THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. 

This system includes the larynx, trachea, and lungs. The characters 
of the larynx in the various groups of snakes have not yet been worked 
out. A small tubercle may be observed at the anterior canthus of the 
glottis in many snakes. In two genera of Colubriuai it is developed 
into a compressed vertical epiglottis, which by its rapid vibrations on 
the expulsion of air from the lungs produces a considerable noise 
{Upiglottophis, Pityophls). The trachea in the Serpentes is not divided 
into bronchial tubes, but where there are two lungs it is discontinued 
at the bifurcation, except in the case of the presence of a rudimental 
right lung. In this case the wall of the trachea is ])erforated by a 
foramen which communicates (rarely by a tube) directly with the rudi- 
mental lung. In such a case the tracheal cartilages may be continued 
for a long distance as a band on the left lung (genera HalsopMSy 
Pityophls). 

The lungs are sacs surrounded by a layer of reticulate bars or 
lamime of greater or less thickness. The bars are most robust at the 
anterior part of the lung, and become more attenuated and inclose 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 695 

larger spaces toward the distal regions. In many species, especially 
the Soleuoglypha, the distal part of the lung has very thin membranous 
walls. In Chersydrus the reticulate structure continues to the extremity, 
and the tracheal lung has no lumen. The left lung does not usually 
extend beyond the gall bladder, but in Cliersydruf< it extends to the 
anus. The post-tracheal or true lungs begin opposite the ventricle 
of the heart, or just posterior to it. The rudimental right lung, when 
present, is situated uear the apex of the heart. 

The condition of knowledge as to the character of the lungs of snakes 
was stated by Stannius, in 1856,* as follows : 

The detailed accounts as to the single or double character of the lungs leave much 
to be desired. Among Ophidia Angiostomata there possess a single sac, ii/u«o^>/i/« 
and all TyphlopidcB which have been examined; as to the Tortricid;c [Ilysiidaj], 
there are apparently species with two lungs {T.xenopeltis) l^Xenopeltis unicolorif 
and others with a single lung (T. sci/tale) [_= Ilysia scytale]. Among Eurystomata, 
all the Peropoda ( Z/oa, Python, Eri/s) possess apparently two lungs. The Calamarina 
that have been investigated have one lung. Among Colubrina and Glyphodonta 
there are great variations. All the Coronellce of Schlegel possess, according to 
Schlegel, a single lung. I find the lung single in Rhachiodon scaber [^Dasijpeltia]. 
Tropidonotus natrix [^Natrix vulgaris'] has a very small rndinieut of a second lung. 
Coluber [Spilotesl variabilis possesses, according to Schlegel, the rudiment of a second 
lung. According to the statement of Meckel, this rudiment is common in Coluber. 
The Xenodous have, according to Schlegel, a single lung (X. severus and X.rhabdo- 
cephalus). In Heterodon I find a rudimental second lung. The Lycodons, according 
to Schlegel, iiossess a single lung; as also do PsammopJns and Hnmalopais. In Den- 
drophis coluhrina Schlegel found the rudiment of the second lung. In Dipsas, accord- 
ing to Schlegel, there are variations ; but he states that D. multimaciilafa, D. Iwris, and 
D. annulata ISibon annulatum] have but otig lung. The Achrochordina have but one 
lung. Among Hydrophidis I found in three species of Rydrophis the lung sac 
simple. Meckel states that Platurus has a very small rudiment of a second lung. 
Among the remaining poisonous snakes there is an insignificant rudiment of the sec- 
ond lung in the Elapina and Crotalina ; while the Viperina possess an entirely simple 
lung. 

In 1894 1 presented to the American Philosophical Society^ the results 
of my studies on this subject, in which I added many observations to 
those previously made, and discovered a number of important system 
atic indications. I also found occasion to correct some of the state- 
ments quoted by Stannius from Schlegel, as above noted. I give here 
tlie results presented in that paper : 

The snakes with rudimental posterior limbs (Peropoda) show in the character of 
their lungs what they show in the rudimental limbs themselves, and in the hemi- 
penis, the nearest relationships to the Lacertilia. They possess, with an exception 
to be noted later, two well- developed lungs, one of which is larger than the other. 
The smaller lung lies to the right side and ventrally, while the larger one lies to the 
left side and dorsally. In some species the dorsal and ventral relation is more pro- 
nounced than in others. In the Colubroidea the right or ventral lung is generally 
present, but of very much reduced proportions, the usual size being from 2-5 ram. in 
length. It is connected with the other lung by a foramen, which perforates the 
tracheal cartilage at a point a little beyond the apex of the heart, and opposite to 



' Zootomie der Amphibien, p. 108. 

^Proceedings Amer. Phil. Soc, XXXIII, 1894, p. 217. 



696 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

the proximal part of the dorsal lung. It is sometimes connected to the dorsal lung 
by a short tiibe, in which cartilaginons half rings are seen in bnt two of the genera 
examined, \iz, Hetcrodon and ConojMs. The lumen of the rudimeiital lung maybe 
lined by the same reticulate structure as is seen in the dorsal lung, or its walls may 
be smooth. In some Colubroidea the rudimental lung is absent, but such species are 
relatively few. 

The dorsal lung may present proximally alongside of the trachea an auricle or 
pocket, and this is so developed in the genus Heterodon as to reach to the head 
without communication wilh the trachea other than that furnished by the normal 
portion of the lung. In the Soleuoglypha, without exception, this extension of the 
dorsal lung is present, aud extends to the head, and its lumen is continuous with the 
trachea throughout its length. The same structure exists in the genera Hydrus and 
Hydrophis, and also in the peropodous genus Ungalia, which differs besides from 
other Peropoda in having but one post- tracheal lung. Finally, the tracheal lung, as 
I have called it, is distinct from the true lung in Platurus and in Chersydrns. In 
the former of these genera the trachea is not separate from the lumen, while in 
Chersydrns it is distinct. It, however, communicates with the cells of which the 
lung consists in this genus by a series of regularly placed foramina on each side. 
There is no lumen in the tracheal lung in Chersydrns. In Typhlops we have a still 
further modification of the tracheal lung. It is without lumen, and is composed of 
coarse cells of different sizes. These have no communication with the trachea or 
lung that I can discover, nor any efferent orifice. It has occurred to me that this 
structure, which extends from the heart to the throat, may not be a pulmonary 
organ. 

I have referi'cd to the dorsal and ventral positions of the two lungs. The rudi- 
mental lung is to the right of the dorsal lung in the Colubroidea, but in the Uysiidai 
it is to the left. It is quite questionable which lung this rudiment in this family 
really represents. In the Typhlopidte the single lung is on the right side and extends 
from the heart to the liver. It has the position of the rudimental lung of the Colu- 
broidea, aud may represent it, I can not decide this question without further mate- 
rial. In Glaucoma there is but one true lung, and this is ventral in position, and 
originates to the right of the heart, so that in this genus also it may represent the 
rudimental lung of the Colubroidea. There is here no tracheal Inng or organ.' 

I now give a synopsis of the characters observed in the sj^ecies examined. 

CATODONTA. 

Glaucoma dulcis Baird and Girard. A single elongate right lung; no rudiment of 
left lung. No tracheal lung.

or lung. 

Tlie presence of the tracheal lung ( ?) and the freedom of the maxillary bone are 
points of resemblance to the Soleuoglypha !

Appendix to Colubridw. 

In the African Thrasops fiavigularis Hallowell the right (rndimental) lung measures 
5 mm. The trachea is enormously expanded transversely, simulating a tracheal 
lung, but its inferior wall contains the tracheal cartilages, which extend its entire 
width, and it contains no cells or trabeculte. An artery with lateral branches 
extends its entire length, which is from the posttracheal lung to the throat. This 
character distinguishes this genus from Leptophis. 

In the following species I found no trace of the right lung:

The rudimental lung is often concealed from Tiew and difficult to discover. The 
best test of its presence is the foramen which connects it with the trachea, which 
will generally be found piercing the cartilage of the latter near the apex of the 
heart. The rudimental organ may then be found by inserting a bristle, and observ- 
ing its destination through the more or less transparent tissues. In but one instance 
have I found a rudimental lung without a connecting foramen, viz, in the Mexican 
Ficimia olivacea. On the other hand, the foramen may terminate in a small blind sac. 

The pulmonary characters may be determined without much dissection. The 
position of the heart must be tirst ascertained, and a longitudinal median incision 
made in the abdominal wall. In all forms except the Epauodonta and Catodonta 
the trachea will be found passing to the left side of the heart and entering the lung 
near its apex. By splitting the trachea not too near its abdominal border, on turn- 
ing the free margin upward as the snake lies on its back, the foramen hroncliiale will 
be seen, and its lumen can be explored. The trachea is concealed by the o'sophagus, 
which must be drawn to the left side of the body in order to make the examination. 
The examination of the tracheal lung requires the division of the abdominal wall 
further toward the head. 

THE UROGENITAL SYSTEM. 

The Serpen tes possess no urinary bladder, but the ureters empty by 
separate orifices into the cloaca. The kidneys are unsymiuetrically 
placed, that of the right side being anterior to that of the left. They 
are transversely lobate. The testes and ovaries are situated consider- 
ably anterior to the kidneys, and are similarly unsymmetrically placed, 
that of the right side being anterior to that of the left. The vas deferens 
is closely folded in its proximal portion, and runs along the external 
side of the kidney, where it is accompanied by the ureter. The two 



700 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898/ 

ducts continue near or close together to the cloaca. The ovaries are 
within elongate folds of the peritoneum. The oviduct is near the edge 
of a deeper fold of the i^eritoneum on each side, and extends from near 
the cephalic extremitj' of the ovary to a common cliamber or vagina, 
which is above the rectum, and opens into the (;loaca. This vaginal 
chamber is large, and is divided more or less completely in the Soleno- 
glypli snakes, is about half divided or deeply bilobate in the Colu- 
broidea, and is undivided in the Peropoda. Its external wall is deeply 
longitudinally grooved, and the internal wall is transversely grooved in 
Crotalus. In Colubroidea generally it is deeply longitudinally grooved 
on all sides. In the Peropoda it is nearly or quite smooth. The cephalic 
extremity of the oviduct is for a short distance transversely plicate or 
lobate, the labia being held in place by simple unfolded bands of the 
inferior and superior edges. The fontanelle is immediately cephalad of 
this region, and has very thin simple walls. Being only a slit, it is 
sometimes difficult to discover. The oviducts do not accompany the 
ureters so closely as do the vasa deferentia, and approach nearer the 
middle line for a short distance below the rectum. 

Like the Sauria the male Serpentes possess two intromittent organs 
or hemipenes. Each is a cylindric hollow body, which when not in 
use is retracted in a corresponding cavity on one side of the middle 
line of the tail. Into its posterior extremity is inserted a cylindrical 
muscle, which is continued posteriorly to a length generally greater 
than that of the hemipenis, to an origin on a caudal vertebra. When 
the hemipenis is in use it is protruded, and its inner surface is evag- 
inated and becomes the external surface, the muscle just described 
occuj^ying its center. It enters the vagina of the female and its 
extremity occupies the corresponding anterior lobe of the latter when 
present. It is withdrawn by the contraction of the central muscle or 
retractor penis. The hemipenis is generally armed with reverted or 
recurved spines. When this is the case the vaginal walls are very 
tough. . When the hemipenis is unarmed the vaginal walls are thinner 
and smoother. 

I have described the characters of the surface of the hemipenis in 
1893,^ and have shown that they furnish good indications of affinity 
and diversity among the snakes. The details then reported will be 
found under the head of classification. The general characters may be 
summarized as follows: 

The hemipenis of the Serpentes is traversed by a groove which 
divides the external investment to the internal integument (or external 
integument when the organ is retracted), which begins at the base 
internally, and soon turns to the external side of the organ and con 
tinues to its extremity. This is the sulcus spermaticus. This sulcus is 
usually bifurcated in venomous snakes, and I find it to be equally bifur- 

' American Naturalist, XXIII, p. 477 ; Transactions of the American Philosophical 
Society, XVIII, 1894, p. 186. 



CROCODTLIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 701 

cated in niauy harmless suakes. The investiug tissues may or may not 
correspond with this bifurcation. Thus the hemipenis may be more or 
less bifurcate, Schlegel states that it is bifurcate in venomous snakes, 
but it is not so in Hydrophis hardwiclcii, Bnnf/arus semifasciatus, lloplo- 
cephalus coronatus, etc., while it is bifurcate in many nonvenomous 
forms. Next to the bifurcation of the sulcus in importance, is the 
nature of the surface of the external investment (internal when 
retracted). In the most perfect types, both venomous and nonvenomous, 
this surface is reticulate like tripe, the inclosed areas forming calyces, 
which may have a suctorial function. Their borders are generally 
papillose, and are sometimes so deeply divided into papilhe as to lose 
their original character. These papillae may be the seat of osseous 
deposit, becoming bristles or spines, which become larger toward the 
middle of the length, and lose their mutual membranous connections. 
These isolated spines may extend to the apex, but they rarely extend 
to the base. The surface may, however, be laminate and not reticulate, 
and the laminjc may be longitudinal or transverse. In either of these 
cases they may not be spiniferous. The apex or apices of the organ 
may be furnished with a rigid papilla or awn. The entire surface of the 
organ when protruded is designed for the maintainance of its position 
in the oviduct of the female, from which it can not be withdrawn except- 
ing by invagination. 

In the Tortricina and Peropoda the hemipenis is not spinous, and 
the sulcus is bifurcate, and in the Boidic the hemipenis is bifurcate 
also, although in some genera {Xiphosoma, Ungnalia) the branches are 
very short. The external integument is never reticulate, but is always 
laminate with elongate papilla; at the extremities, in Uj^icrates, Xipho- 
soma, and Ungnalia. The laminse are pinnate from the sulcus as an 
axis in Morelia, Enygrus, Lichanura, and Eryx., and are transverse in 
Charina. In Ilysia they are pinnate, with a few longitudinal plicse 
below. 

The principal variations in the Colubroidea are as follows: 

No spines; surface longitudinally plicate; the surface of the hemi- 
penis is flounced more or less transversely; the surface is more or less 
reticulate, and the sulcus spermaticus is undivided; hypapophyses 
anterior; the surface is reticulate or longitudinally plicate, and the 
sulcus is divided; hypapophyses anterior; the surface is neither reticu- 
late nor flounced, and the spines when present are disconnected; hypa- 
pophyses continued to caudal vertebra\ 

Similar gradations in the characters of the hemipenis are to be seen 
in the types of venomous snakes. Thus in the Proteroglypha this organ 
is spinous to the tip, on a calyculate basis, in Hydrophis, Elaps {surina- 
mensis), Bendraspis. It is reticulate at the extremities and spinous 
below, in Gallophis [bivirgatus), Xaja, Acanthophis, Bungarus, and 
Sepedon; the apex smooth in the two genera last named. In Elaps 
nigrocinctus the organ is usually smooth, with a few spines at the apex. 



702 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Ill Solenoglypha tlie geuus Atractaspis is spinous to the apex, appar- 
ently on a longitudinally laminate basis. In the Viperidae and Crotal- 
idie the spines are on a flounced basis. The apices are calyculate in 
Bitis, Clotho, and Vipera, and spinous in Cerastes. They are calycu- 
late in Crotalidae, in Bothrops, Ancistrodon, Sistritrus, Crotalus, and 
JJropsophus. In Crotalus {durissus of the Neotropical fauna) the median 
spines are replaced by papillae; in all the other genera they are spinous. 

II. SYSTEMATIC CONSIDERATIONS. 

Diversity of lung structure accompanies the primary groups which 
are characterized by peculiarities of the skeleton to such a degree tbat 
we are warranted in according it a high systematic value. Thus 
Angiostomatous and Peropodous snakes have two lungs, while the 
Colubroidea have one and a rudiment, and the Solenoglj^pha always 
have a tracheal lung. Exceptions and variations from these rules thus 
become of importance. Thus I have no doubt of the propriety of the 
separation of the Ungaliidse from the other Peropoda, on account of 
its pulmonary characters. Nor is there any doubt in my mind of the 
necessity of the separation of the Leptognathiuft from the Xenodon- 
tinae, on account of its large tracheal lung. The very marked charac- 
ters of the genus Chersydrus characterize the family, as well as the 
osteological characters. It remains to be seen whether the family I 
termed the Nothopidae, but which Boulenger unites with the Chersy- 
dridiie agrees with it in pulmonary characters. The remarkable 
tracheal lung or gland distinguishes the Epanodonta from the Cato 
donta, emphasizing the differences observed in the osteology of the 
skull. The huge diverticulum of Heierodon serves to distinguish the 
genus from its allies. The extraordinary transverse dilatation of the 
trachea in Thrasops establishes the genus as distinct. 

The value of the rudimental right lung as a character of the Colu- 
broidea is increased by my investigations. In only two genera have 
I found it either present or absent, namely, Halsophis and Pityophis. I 
am not sure but that I may yet find it in the P. nielanoleucus, where I 
have failed hitherto, but I am sure that it is present in some species 
of Halsophis and wanting in others. A natural group of American 
Colubrinae, appears to be characterized by its absence, namely, Rhino- 
chilus, Gemophora, and Ophiholus; all genera with an entire anal shield. 
The development of cartilages in the bronchial foramen or tube of 
the rudimental lung is not a constant character. I found it in one 
Heterodon platyrhinus and not in another; it is present in Conophis 
pulcher, but absent in C. sumichrastii. 

The numerous characters presented by the hemipenis have various 
values. Several very distinct types are distinguishable, but they are 
continuous at some point, through intermediate forms. This is, how- 
ever, the history of all characters which distinguish organic beings, 
especially of those which have been relied on as characters of the 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 703 

minor divisions and genera of the Serpentes. The characters which I 
have discovered in the hemipenis have added greatly to our resources 
in the attempt to learn the relationships and hence origin of the mem- 
bers of the Serpentes. 

In a broad way we may distinguish as leading types the following: 
The smooth; the plicate, or flounced; the calyculate, or ruched; and the 
disk-bearing. Any of these may have the sulcus spermaticus simple 
or bifurcate, and some of them may have the middle i)art of the organ 
spinous or not. The spines may extend to the apex so as to obliter- 
ate the pattern and the total organ may be bifurcate or not. As regards 
the indications of affinity presented by these types, it may be said that 
the nearer we approach the Sauria the less spinous is the organ, 
and the further away is the form the more, certainly will the ruched 
structure prevail. The tendency to bifurcation is present in most 
groups, but it is universal in but one suborder, the Solenoglypha, or 
specialized venomous snakes. 

In the Oriental region we have the smoothest type of Colubroidea, 
which includes the genera really allied to Galamaria, many of which 
have had hitherto widely different positions in the systems. Owing to 
tee scarcity of specimens of this type in American museums, I have 
not been able to investigate them fully. The great Colubrine division 
is remarkably constant in its undivided sulcus and abundant calyces. 
In degenerate types the calyces become less numerous. The groove- 
toothed Dipsadines have the same structure. Except one Australian 
genus {Acanthophls) all the dis(;iferous types are neotropical and all 
have a double sulcus. The other neotropical types with double sulcus 
may be calyculate or spinous and they present a great variety of detail. 
Here again the glyphodont and aglyphodont types are quite parallel 
to each other. The structure in the water snakes is again different 
and characteristic. The organ is feebly spinous from the base to or 
near to the apex, possessing no calyces, disk, or transverse plica?, and 
the prehensile function is maintained by one or a few large hook-shaped 
spines at the base. In 1864 I referred several genera which had been 
placed in the Calamarinte to the water snakes on account of the con- 
tinuation of the hypapophyses to the tail. I was much gratified on 
examining their hemipenes to find that they (genera Tropidodonium^ 
Virf/lnia, and Haldea) present exactly the characters of the group to 
which the vertebra' indicated that they should be referred. In like 
manner I have been able to refer genera supposed to belong to the 
Calamarinw to almost every natural division of the Colubroidea by 
the study of the hemipenis. The old CalamariutTe of authors is snn])ly 
an aggregation of burrowing or degraded forms of several natural 
groups. 

The Natricine (water snake) group is connected with the groove- 
toothed water snakes (Homalopsina'), and both of these groups pass 
probably into the Lycodontine series, the typical forms of which the 



704 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

spiues are arranged in flounces. It is difficult as yet, and perhaps may 
not become easy, to distinguish some members of the Lycodont group 
from certain ground snakes with totally spinous hemipenis, especially 
certain African genera, as Elapops, Grayia, and others. These ques- 
tions remain for further research. 

I have found the characters of the hemipenis as constant as those of 
any other part of the organism. Occasional irregularities are to be 
looked for, but the onl^^ one which I have met with is in the case of a spe- 
cimen of Boodoii infernal is from South Africa, in which the hemipenis is 
shortly bifurcate on one side and not so on the other. There is a ten- 
dency to bifurcation in some individuals of Opliiholiis getulus which is 
not conspicuous in others, but this tendency does not appear in the 
sulcus. It is a tendency only. While certain characters of this organ, 
as already remarked, characterize series or groups of genera, others 
characterize the genera themselves. These are given in the analytical 
tables under the family and subfamily heads. On examining these 
tables it will be seen that the genera brought into close juxtaposition 
are frequently not most closely allied in general appearance. The leys 
are only intended to present the penial characters; are not intended to dis- 
play the serial or other relationships of the genera among themselves. 

1 now give the exact definitions of the divisions as far as definable 
with present information. The definitions of the suborders are those 
of Miiller, modified by myself.^

In the following pages I present synoptical diagnoses of the genera 
of the Serpentes arranged in key form. These are placed under sub- 

' Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc, 1886, p. 479. 

2 This arrangement was first published by the writer in the Proceedings of the 
Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, for 1864, p. 230. The definitions of the 
lower primary divisions were derived from J. Miiller. It was published in greater 
detail, with the characters of all the families in the Proceedings of the American 
Philosophical Society, 1866, 479, and in the Bulletin of the U. S. National Museum, 
No. 32, 1887, p. 47. 

3 The characters of this division as I originally gave them (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. 
Phila., 1864, p. 230) were derived from J. Miiller, which have been shown to b© 
partially erroneous by Dumeril and Bibron, and Peters. 



CllOCODiLiANS, LIZARDlfl, AND SNAKES. 705 

family heads, which are uot, with the exceptiou of the Houuilopsinae, 
detiiied. It is not certain, therefore, that their contents are in all cases 
properly limited or distributed. It remains a desideratum to discover 
the characters of the natural divisions of the Colubridie, if any there 
be. " The characters presented by Dumeril and Bibron, and by Giin- 
tlier, are important but insufficient. For the definition of the genera 
distinct characters exist, although the subject is one of much difficulty. 
The object of definition being, as I imagine, precision, and the conse- 
quent increased facility of determination, I have emjiloyed all struc- 
tural characters whatever, and only neglected them where it is evident 
that they are inconstant within the limits of a species. I find of the 
greatest importance the grooved or nongrooved characters of the pos- 
terior teeth, and the absence or number of the scale pits. The division 
or nondivisiou of the anal scutum is also of much importance, although 
in a very few genera (for example Xenodoti) it is not constant. Rely- 
ing, as the system always must, on exact characters, I have not allowed 
considerations of "physiognomy" to change a result where it contiicts 
witli structure, which is, however, rarely the case. The tendency of some 
authors to neglect characters and to depend on " physiognomy " destroys 
precision and explains nothing, besides rendering identification of 
species most laborious, resting as it must in that case on purely empir- 
ical methods. I also do not use as generic characters the number of 
rows of scales, or of labial scuta, believing that these are only available 
in the distinction of species. 

In a few instances 1 have not been able to examine the skeletons of 
genera of doubtful position, so that their reference to a family division 
may yet have to be altered. I have, however, studied the fine series 
in the museums of Paris and Washington, besides a considerable num- 
ber in my own collection. For the characters of many genera which I 
have not seen I have had to rely on the descriptions of others, espe- 
cially those of the recently issued second edition of the Catalogue of 
Snakes, in the British Museum, by Boulenger. 

III. PHYLOGENY. 

The earliest snakes known to paleontologists have been found in 
the Upper Cretaceous beds of Europe and North America, those of the 
former region being a little the older. Some of these are allied to 
the Boas, while others are said by Sauvage to display characters of the 
Epanodonta. But few specimens are known, and these are vertebriii, 
so that their characters remain uncertain. Marsh has described some 
ophidian vertebrie from the Laramie beds of the Rocky Mountain 
region. I have described the genus Ilelayras from rather numerous 
vertebra from the Puerco bed of New Mexico. An interesting pecul- 
iarity of this genus is the imperfection of the zygantrum in some ver- 
tebra' and the robustness of the neural si)ine. Next in time are the 
Pahvophids, vertebra; of which Owen first discovered in the English 
NAT MUS 1)8 45 



700 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Eocene, and I subsequently obtained from the marine Eoceue of New 
Jersey. Tiiese snakes were of large size, and display points of resem- 
blance to the Boidie. Venomous snakes first appear in the Upper Mio- 
cene. A'iperidii' were found by Lartet in France, and I have found 
Crotalida' in the corresponding (Loup Fork) bed in Kansas. The evi- 
dence from paleontology, then, is, so far, that the Peropoda appeared 
earlier in time and the Solenoglypba later. This is in accordance witli 
their systematic; relations. However, we have little to base an actual 
phylogeny upon, from the paleontological evidence at present, and we 
can only draw inferences from structural characters in their relation 
to other groups of reptiles, and especially to the other orders of the 
Squamata. 

It is probable that the Peropoda are the earliest and ancestral form 
of the Serpentes, since they display characters in both the skeleton, 
penial structure and viscera, which approach the Sauria. The Scole- 
cophidia are allied to them, but can not be regarded as ancestral, but 
rather as degenerate descendants, being connected with them by the 
intervening group of the Tortricina. On the other hand, the ascending 
series may be traced through the Colubroidea to the Solenoglypha. 
Among the Colubroidea we may regard the Aglyphodonta as nearest 
the Peropoda and the Opisthoglypha and Proteroglypha as side 
branches. The latter lead to the Solenoglypha. AVe know of no 
direct transitions between Opisthoglypha and Proteroglypha, but the 
genera fhpiwdon Peters and Glyphodon Giinther, which have numerous 
grooved teeth, furnished an ancestral type from which both could 
have been derived. The Platycerca, some of which Bouleuger shows 
have grooved teeth behind the fangs, may have been derived from the 
same source. This phylogeny may be schematically represented as 
follows :

peutes, although they form as a whole an ascending line. The line of 
the Tortricina and Scoleeophidia is such, as already remarked, and 
these are approached by the ground Peropoda, as Uryx, Charma, etc. 
Nearly every division of the ascending line exhibits degenerate side 
branches, and mostly of a similar type. Thus in the Opisthoglypha we 
have the small burrowing type of TantiUa and similar forms in Amer- 
ica, and in Africa Aparallactus and others. Of Proteroglypha, EUips 
shows a tendency in the same direction, and in Yermicella (Australia) 
it is more pronounced. The same thing is observable in most of the 
divisions of the Aglyphodonta. The Old World Calamarina^, which 
approach nearest the Peropoda, present many such types. In the 
Aglyphodont series the acquisition of the calyculate structure of the 
hcmipenis with spines is evidence of advanced type, the flounced cliar- 
acter being inferior and directly affiliated with the Calamarian and 
Peropodiin. We have in the Colubrinte examples of degenerate types 
(mostly in Central America), where the calyces become reduced in num- 
ber and the proportion of spines increased in connection with degen- 
eracy in other respects. The same degeneracy in primal structure may 
take place when the flounces become obsolete and spines only are left. 
It is possible that the Natricine group aci^uired its primal character in 
this way, without having passed through a calyculate stage. This 
group also has its specially degenerate forms in America, as Storeria, 
Virginia., and Haldea. 

Among the Solenoglypha we have a conspicuous examjile of degen- 
eracy in the African genus Atractaspis, which, like the other examples 
above cited, is a burrower in its habits. In external appearance it 
considerably resembles the Opisthoglyph genus Aparallactus , of the 
same region. Degeneracy of the hemipenis by loss of calyces and 
extension of spines is seen in the genera Cerastes and UcJiis. 

The degeneracy so far referred to consists in the reduction of the 
mechanism of rapid movement, the contraction of the mouth parts, the 
reduction of the eyes, and the shortening of the tail. All of these con- 
sequences have probably resulted from the adoption of a more or less 
subterranean life, or "earth-parasitism," as I have termed it, as they 
certainly are associated in life. Another kind of degeneracy, whicli is 
less common, is the attenuation of bones surrounding the mouth and 
the reduction in number and size of the teeth, conditions associated 
with the use of soft food, as caterpillars, etc This is exhibited by the 
iamily of the Amblycephalidu', which live in the forests of the Indian 
and neotropical regions. Accompanying the reduction of the jaws is 
an abbreviation of the muzzle, which, with the large eye, gives a very 
fcBtal character to the head. 

Having thus cleared the main lines of degenerate comidications, we 
could trace the ascending series of the Aglyphodonta, had we the mate- 
rial. This is unfortunately insufficient. That the Xatricina' are a 
distinct line is attested by their continue<l vertebral hypapophyses,

In this table the Lycodoutiuie are not regarded as charaftized by 
elongate anterior teeth as is usually done. Some of the genera are truly 
so characterized, as Lycodon and others, but they are off the main line. 
As to the Xenodontinse it is impossible to determine whether they are 
derived from Calamariuie (which are not now found in the same region 
with them) or whether they have come off the Oolubrinas by loss of 
calyces and development of apical disc. 

IV. HISTORY. 

Linnaeus did not correctly distinguish the suborder Serpentes, but 
placed its species in a heterogenous assemblage,' along with the snake- 
like lizards and the batrachian Coeciliidse. Laurenti, in 17G8,^ followed 
him, changing the name to Serpentia. 

The name Ophidia was jjroijosed by Brongniart in 1799,^ but the defi- 
nition of this order, as he esteemed it, was not improved. In the sys- 
tem of Oppel (1811)^ we find the Ophidia (which he spelled Ophidii), 
purged of all extraneous forms excepting the Amphisbtienia. Under 
the name Serpentia, Merrem, in 1820, adopted the group as left by Oppel. 
Wagler^ finally reduced the division to its proper contents in 1830 and 
retained for it the name Serpentes. As this was the first publication 
in which the suborder, was properly limited, the name given must be 
retained. Dumeril defined the group correctly, employing the Brong- 
niartian name Ophidia. In this he has been followed by most later 
authors, including Gray, Stannius, Owen, and Huxley. 

As regards the contents of the suborder Serpentes, the first classifi- 
cation of a thorough character was that of J. Miiller, who in 1831,'* 
divided the Serpentes into two divisions, the Microstomata ( = Angio- 
stomata) and Macrostomata ( = Eurystoniata), basing them on the pro- 
portions and position of the paroccipital bone or suspensorium of tlie 
quadrate; separating the Peropoda on account of the rudiments of 
pelvis. The next classification was that of Dumeril, who with Bibron

investigated especially tbe dental structures and divided the order 
into Opoterodonta, Agiyphodonta, Opisthoglypba, Proteroglyplia, and 
Soleuoglypba. The first is Augiostomatous and the last four are 
Eurystomatous. In the system of Stannius ' we have other than 
dental characters considered. Thus the Angiostoraata are divided 
into Typhlopina and Tortricina, and the Burystomata into Peropoda, 
Asinea, and Thauatophidia, the last including all of the venomous 
snakes. In 1845 G-ray, in his catalogue of snakes in the British 
Museum, had combined forms with grooved i^osterior teeth and the 
colubriform venomous snakes with the harmless snakes under the 
name Colubroidea, and this arrangement was continued by Giinther 
in his catalogue of tbe Colubrine snakes of tbe British Museum in 
1802. The author of the present work adopted a system which 
included the merits of those already in existence, adopting the 
divisions of Miiller and Stannius with those of Dumeril, placing the 
Opisthoglypba with tbe true Colubroidea like Gray, but adopting 
for the entire group Staunius's name, Asinea. I also rearranged some 
of the venomous genera in accordance with their cranial structure, 
which bad been overlooked by previous authors. Finally, in the sys- 
tem of Boulenger, as adopted in the Catalogue of Snakes in the British 
Museum, the Opisthoglypba and Proteroglypha of Dumeril are included 
in the Colubriform superfamily, as was done by Gray and Giinther. 
This division, Colubroidea, was then divided into Aglypha, Glypho- 
donta, and Proteroglypha. 

The classification of the great mass of the Colubroid snakes has 
always been a difficult i)roblem. Dumeril relied on the relative pro- 
portions of the teeth, and established numerous "families" based upon 
them. These divisions are often not natural, while others are entirely 
tenable. On the whole, however, the larger divisions, based on pro- 
portionate lengths and apart from the grooving for conveying saliva, 
lack definition, owing to the insensible gradations which they present. 
The characters adduced by Dumeril are, however, of general applica- 
cation in the definition of genera. Their application has been extended 
by Boulenger, but to a degree of refinement which is in some cases not 
practicable, owing to gradations. Hence it became important to dis- 
cover other characters. This I have done in those exhibited by the 
tbe male intromittent organ and by the pulmonary structure. The 
former furnish many characters which express affinity or the reverse, 
a! id re-enforce or modify those which we have hitherto possessed. 

V. HABITS. 

The peculiar form of tbe snakes among vertebrate animals, their 
comparative abundance, and the fact that some of them are especially 
dangerous to life, invests them with more popular interest than any 
other gronp of reptiles. 

The characteristics of the venomous forms will be pointed out in the

710 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

following^ pages. Meanwhile 1 will refer to the fact that while the 
general fades of the typical venomous snakes (Solenoglypha) is easily 
recognized by the eye, the characters of the frequently no less danger- 
ous Proteroglypha are not so easily distinguished from those of the 
harmless ones. They are only to be distinguished by an especial 
knowledge of species or by an examination of the dentition. In the 
Columbian fauna we have but one genus which presents this deter- 
minate appearance, Elaps, but in the warm regions of the Old World 
such genera abound, and in Australia there is no other type of 
venomous snakes. 

In the Solenoglypha the bite is effected by two movements. The 
first is the spring of the body, and the second is the grasp by the max- 
illary bones, which work freely by a ginglymus on the prefrontal bones. 
The bite as exhibited by a lizard or a mammal, by the closing of the 
lower jaw on the upper, is of little effect in the Solenoglypha, if it occurs 
at all, while the movement of the maxillary bones is very consj)icuous. 
I was once nearly bitten by the nearly severed head of a Grotalus molos- 
SMS, nothing but a piece of skin connecting it with the body, as I was 
exhibiting the large fangs. A Sistrurus catenatus edicardsH, which I 
held by the neck on one occasion, opened and closed its fang bearing 
maxillaries energetically. This may be observed also in other Crotalids 
when about to bite and unable to reach their enemy. It is quite the 
reverse with the Proteroglypha. Authors agree that the Ela/ps closes 
the lower jaw, holding its prey in its mouth and piercing it repeatedly 
with the fangs. The movement of the maxillary, so conspicuous in the 
Crotalida?, is impossible to these serpents. 

The question as to whether the Opisthoglyph serpents are venomous 
in any degree has been recently discussed. A synopsis of what is known 
on this subject has been recently published by Dr. L. Stejneger,' of the 
U. S. IS^ational Museum, and from it I make the following extracts: 

It seeDis that the Dutch professor, Reinwardt, while in Java, was the first to dis- 
cover that certain snakes, dreaded by the inhabitants of that island as venomous, 
are provided with long grooved fangs at the posterior end of the maxillary bone. 
He communicated this discovery to Dr. H. Boie, in Leydeu, who published it in 1826.- 
The suspicion expressed by Professor Reinwardt that this channel or groove on the 
anterior side of these fangs might convey the fluid from a poison gland led to sev- 
eral important investigations, the first of which to be published was Dr. Hermann 
Schlegel's memoir on the salivary glands of the serpents with grooved teeth.^ 

He came to the conclusion that inasmuch as he found the structure of their glands 
to be similar to that of other salivary glands, there could be no doubt that they 
secrete "a fluid similar to the ordinary saliva;" and as "recent observations of 
travelers " served to show that the bites of snakes with grooved teeth produce no fatal 
results to man, he asserted with characteristic positiveness that it is '' erroneous" to 
class with venomous serpents those snakes which have the posterior teeth long and 
channeled. However, a short time after, Prof. G. L. Duvernoy, of Strassburg, pub-

lished a no less important treatise on the subject.^ He pointed to the yellow por- 
tion of the siipramaxillary ghiud as being structurally ditferent from the white 
portion, and from its being connected with a large grooved fang by a single duct he 
concluded, with equal assurance, that we have he-e before us a venom apparatus 
only in degree differing from that of the snakes with poison fangs fixed to the ante- 
rior end of the maxillary bone. His results were accepted and introduced into the 
classification adopted in the monumental herpetological work of Dumeril and 
Bibron, the Erpetologie G(^ncrale, in which the snakes with grooved posterior 
fangs were jdaced in a separate group as " Opistogh/phs." On the other hand, 
Schlegel, paying no attention whatever to Duvernoy, in his Physiognomic des Ser- 
pentes, maintained his standpoint, and so great was the authority of the learned 
Leyden professor that his view was until quite recently accepted bj- some of the 
most prominent systematists. It seems that neither side ever attempted to end the 
disi»ute by direct experiments, and gradually the Opistoglyphs to many herpetologists 
ceased even to be "suspected." 

About ten years ago the interest in this question was suddenly revived, and as it 
may now be fairly regarded as a burning one, some space will be devoted to a short 
review of several of the recent investigations into this theme. 

Two Italian students, M. G. Peracca and C. Deregibus, were led to make special 
investigations into the possible venomous nature oi Malpolon lacertina { = Cwlopeltis 
iiisiguitus), a snake common about Nizza and in parts of Italy. In a communica- 
tion to the Academy of Medicine at Turin, in May, 1883,- after first describing the 
grooved fangs, the glands, and the duct leading to the fangs, they recounted their 
experiences with the snake in question. 

Their experiments were carried out with two specimens of Citlopeltis {=Malpolon), 
one of medium size, the other much larger; the victims consisted of lizards, frogs, 
and toads. The snake did not bite them voluntarily; it was necessary to open its 
mouth and to force the animal into its throat; whereupon the snake inoculated the 
venom, the motion of the bone carrying the poison fangs being very distinctly seen 
ou account of the manner in which they were standing out from the posterior part 
of the head. The act of biting lasted some mornents, and the snake repeated this 
act several times without allowing its prey to escape. 

The animals were bitten in the hind limb; in the case of the frog the skin had to 
be removed from the part to be bitten, as the irritating secretion of the skin 
appeared to be particularly distasteful to the snake. Without reciting the various 
experiments in det.ail, the authors state the more apparent phenomena accompany- 
ing them to be (1) the suspension of the respiration, which in the main occurs in 
a very few minutes (thirteen minutes being the maximum in a toad) and may happen 
suddenly, or may be preceded by a gradual sinking, interrupted by a deep breathing 
pause; (2) the cessation of rellex movements in the bitten limb, while still persist- 
ing for some time in the rest of the body; the excitements a])plied below the bitten 
point ceased almost immediately to be transmitted to the medulla and to show 
reflexes. This alteration maintained itself local for some time, afterwards progress- 
ing toward the periphery along the nerves of the wounded limb. The general 
paralysis does not delay long in coming. It is but rarely accompanied by convul- 
sions. The heart continues to beat for a long while (in the toad), but its strength 
decreases gradually. The blood revealed nothing notable under the spectroscope; 
as a matter of course it had become venous at the suspension of the respiration. The 
rapid changes which were observed at the wounded point are noteworthy; the mus- 
cular tissue became livid and inexcitable. Death ensued generally in half an hour, or 
less; in a toad it took place in twenty-six minutes. The heart of a frog continued 
to beat for many hours after. The authors then call attention t'j the interesting 
similarity between the above symptoms and those accompanying the poisoning by

712 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

tbe cobrn de capello, and finally state that they have made controlling experiments 
with innocnous snakes which did not have such effect upon the animals bitten. 

In a subsequent rdsum^ of this article ' the same authors add that the effects of 
the bite of the Malpolon are not to be feared by man. " It seems," they say, " that 
the bite is only dangerous to reptiles, birds, and small mammals (mice) ; young dogs 
have resisted the poison rather well." 

Similar investigations and experiments were carried out about the same time, or 
a little earlier (1882), on an American species in Guanajuato, Mexico, by Prof. A. 
Duges, who has published his notes concerning Trimorphodon hiscidatits," a snake 
belonging to a genus representatives of which have been found along our southern 
border. He gives figures of his dissections, showing the venomous gland, with its 
duct supplying the grooved j)osterior fangs with the poison. He records his experi- 
ence as follows : 

"One day I was admiring the snake. I saw him seize a Cnemidophorns aexlineatua 
[the striped swift, a lizard] at the middle of the body, advancing its jaws so as to 
bring the corner of the mouth in contact with the body of the lizard; for several 
moments it cheived (a rare occurrence in a snake) its victim without the latter mov- 
ing, letting go after having killed it; but at this juncture the saurian was swallowed 
by another snake {Ophiboliis dollatus) which was kept in the same cage, thus pre- 
venting me from finishing the observation. A few days after, the same Trimorpho- 
don caught another Cnemidophorus by the left arm and chewed it several times. At 
the end of a few minutes the bitten animal died without convulsions, without 
agitation, as if asleep, a little blood issuing from the wound." 

A little later (1885), Mr. Otto Edmund Eiffe^ published some observations, also 
made iu 1882, on TarhopMs vivax, an opistoglyph snake inhabiting the countries 
bordering on the Eastern Mediterranean, and from his account we quote as follows: 

"I offered the half-grown snake a perfectly healthy Lacerta rivipara, which he at 
once commenced to lap with his tongue and then grasped slowly behind the forelegs. 
The lizard defended itself as best it could and used its teeth well on the enemy. In 
less than a minute the lizard was almost motionless, the jaws were powerless, and 
the eyes closed; before the expiration of another half minute the lizard died, and 
was then swallowed." 

Prof. L^on Vaillant, of the Museum of Natural History, at Paris, observed the 
poisonous eft'ect of the bite of another of the opistoglyph snakes, Tragops prasinus, 
Wagler, and gives the following interesting account of one of the observations : ■• 

"A small living green lizard was presented to the snake by means of a forceps. The 
snake seized it across the neck without descending from the shrubbery among which 
it used to live, and by the play of the jaws drew it back to the corner of the mouth. 
The lizard tossed and bent about, winding its body and tail round the head of the 
snake; three minutes Liter it hangs dowji inert, only the tail still trembling; after 
a similar space of time convulsions of the whole body occur again, twining itself 
around the head, then relapsing without motion, except some spasmodic undulations 
of the tail ; this lasts for two minutes, and the animal is dead. It will be seen that 
this poison must have been tolerably active, as it caused the death of the lizard in 
about eight minutes after the puncture by the fangs, which must have taken place 
when the lizard reached the angle of the mouth, as the snake made no movement 
after that." 

It seems quite plain from these observations that we have here to do with a spe- 
cific poison. The victims succumbed within a A'cry short time, and while it is evi- 
dent that death was not caused by the mechanical injury inflicted by the bite, much 
less by the shock, there is as little room for assuming that it was due to the action 
of bacteria-infected ordinary saliva.

These experiments have again aroused tlie interest in the morphology and physi- 
ology of these glands, and two years ago, sixty years after Duvernoy's work, Mr. F.. 
Niemann i)nblished ' some investigations upon this subject. Among other snakes he' 
dissected and described two species with i)osterior grooved fangs, and he clearly 
demonstrates that, in both, the yellowish gland has already passed the innocuous 
stage and become a true poison gland, though structurally somewhat intermediate — 
as are, iu fact, the fangs. He found in both species the yellowish gland well cir- 
(■umscribed and clearly differentiated from the true supralabial gland, although 
both glands are contained in the same envelope of connective tissue, and he was 
able to trace the single duct leading from the yellowish gland to the groove of the 
posterior elongated fang. One of the species was Tragops prasinus, Wagler (the 
same species with which Professor Vaillant experimented), and an inhabitant of the 
East Indies, the other being Sihon annulatum (Linnaeus), from tropical America. 
Fig. 1 is a copy of Mr. Niemann's schematic representation of the arrangement in the 
former. Fig. 2 shows a section of the grooved fang near its base, copied from the 
same author. 

That these snakes are not entirely harmless, even to man, is evident from the very 
recent experience of Mr. J. J. Quelch, of Georgetown, British Guiana,- who was, 
bitten on the first finger by a large specimen of the common red-white-aud-black- 
banded snake, Erythrolamprus venustissimus, driving its hinder grooved teeth three 
times down into the fiesh. About half an hour after, the finger became much swollen 
at the place and distinctly very painful. It was not till about four hours afterward 
that real relief was obtained, though the place was tender for a much longer time. 
Another case was that of the clerk iu the Museum, who was bitten on the finger by 
a young specimen of the common frog snake, or Mattipi, Xenodon severus, whose 
hinder enlarged teeth were driven deeply into the flesh, with a result similar to that 
described iu the case of the other snake. 

It will l)e observed that while the snake by which Mr. Quelch himself was bitten; 
is a true opistoglyph with grooved posterior fangs, the one which caused a similar 
result in the clerk, viz, the Xenodon, has the enlarged posterior teeth solid and not 
grooved. I would call attention to the fact, however, that this identical species is; 
described by Duvernoy'^ as having the yellowish gland well diff'erentiated. That 
the bite of the allied species, Xenodon rhahdocephahis, did apparently have no unpleas- 
ant effect on Dr. Stradling^ is not difficult of explanation in view of the fact that, 
occasionally the bite of some of even the most dangerous snakes has been ineftect- 
ive; but enough is said to show that the question is not an unreasonable one: Is it^ 
essential for a truly venomous snake to possess f/rooved fangs? 

As a matter of fact, at the very moment of this sentence going to press, the ques- 
tion seems answered conclusively in the negative by the experiments of I'hisalis: 
and Bertrand, who have shown that the saliva of even ordinary solid-toothed harm- 
less snakes contains the same specific poison which characterizes the dreaded! 
Thanatophidia. 

But four geuera of Opisthoglj^pba enter the political bouudaries of 
the United States, namely, Sibon, Trimorphodon, Goniophanes, and 
Tantilla. Of these only the second and fourth can be properly reckoned 
to the Oolunibiaii Fauna. 

Snakes are popularly believed to possess a power of "charming" or 
attracting to themselves other animals, especially birds, against their 
will, so that they easil^^ capture them for food. This belief rests on a 
habit which is usual among the smaller birds, of annoying other ani-

mals which they dislike oi- fear. Everyone knows how they will con- 
gregate about an owl who has not sufficiently concealed itself by 
daylight, and will make their hostility known by cries and efforts to 
strike their enemy. So I have witnessed a crowd of birds collected 
about a black snake, which displayed their hostility by many cries and 
movements, the snake the while eying them with an inactive interest. 
Should one of the birds venture too near, I strongly suspect that the 
snake w^ould take advantage of the opportunity to secure a meal, but 
this I have not witnessed. I believe, however, that the stories of 
"charming" are due to an observation of this not uncommon experience 
of the Held naturalist. 

Snakes are for the most part carnivorous ; a few forms, as, for example, 
the genus Hcrpeton^ are more or less herbivorous. They are most effec- 
tive restrainers of the undue increase of the small Mammalia, and, in the 
case of the smaller snakes, of the increase of insects, by the destruction 
of the larv;e, as well as of the imagines. They are the assured friends of 
the agriculturist, and as such should be permitted to live and increase. 
This may be safely done in North America, where there is really but one 
species of venomous snake not easily distinguished, the Flaps fnlviiis, 
and that is confined to the Gulf border and a small part of that of the 
southern Atlantic. Some of the large Colubrine snakes, for example, 
of the genus Compsosoma, are permitted to live in and about the houses 
of the natives in some parts of South America, and in some localities of 
western North America the large and harmless Pityophides perform the 
same function. All of our species of Oolubroidea, however, are of util- 
ity to man and should be permitted to live, not only on this account, 
but also on account of the beauty of their forms and often coloration. 

In discussing the breeding habits of certain snakes Prof. O. P. Hay' 
makes the following remarks: 

Notwithstandiug the deep impression whicli serpents have niade on the human 
mind, as shown in literature and in popular conversation, it is astonishing how little 
accurate information has been accumulated concerning some of their habits. The 
densest ignorance, the result of inattention and general lack of interest, prevails 
with regard to some of the most interesting matters connected with the life history 
of snakes ; while, on the other hand, many of the popular notions about the powers 
of these animals are either wholly false or are gross exaggerations of the truth. 
The breeding habits of our snakes, even of the most common species, belong among 
the things about which little is known. Even our biologists have given but little 
attention to this subject, while unscientific people simply recognize the fact that 
nests of snakes' eggs are occasionally met with. For instance, who would not su))- 
pose that all the essential facts are known concerning the reproduction of the com- 
mon black racer Bascanion constrictor? Nevertheless, where have we been told when 
it lays its eggs, how many there are of them, how they are concealed, and when 
they hatch ? 

Some snakes are known to lay eggs which after a period produce young. Other 
snakes are known to retain the eggs within the body until the young have attained 
sutlicient size and strength to care for themselves after birth. Still other species 
are supposed sometimes to lay eggs, at other times to bring forth living young, -

or to produce some eggs ;iud some living young at the same time.' There are, 
indeed, oviparous snakes and snakes which are ovoviviparous, and there is a 
conspicuous difl'erence in their eggs. The eggs of the oviparous species are fur- 
nished with a thick, tough, flexible covering or "shell," while the eggs of the 
species which produce living young have coverings which are very thin and 
delicate. Now, should such eggs as the latter be laid any considerable period 
before the young are ready to be excluded, the thin envelopes would surely be torn 
during the writhings of the embryo. That some of the eggs may be partially 
developed at the time when the embryos of other eggs are ready to be ushered 
into the world, and that all may be expelled together, is possible; but this is not 
the normal course of things and may not be well for the immature young. Normally 
the coverings of such eggs are ruptured before birth or immediately afterwards. 
On the other hand, it is quite probable that the eggs of the oviparous species are 
laid a considerable period before they are hatched. The tough coverings of such 
eggs protect them from attacks and injuries from without and at the same time 
resist the movements of the young snake within. So far as we know these eggs are 
deposited in the earth in piles of decaying vegetable matter and similar places. 

A very curious structure deserves mention here. This is the " egg-tooth," a small 
tooth fixed to the united premaxillary bones and projecting forward slightly beyond 
the edge of the upper lip. It is present only in the embryo and is abed shortly after 
the escape of the young snake from the egg. In the ovoviviparous species, the tooth 
may apparently be shed before the young are born. The tooth is employed by the 
little snake in ripping open the tough egg covering in its efforts to escape from its 
prison. It would appear to be of little service to the young, which are mature when 
born, since the egg coverings are so very tender; nevertheless I have found the 
tooth present in all of the ovoviparous species whose young I have had opportunity 
to study. This tooth, as found in the black racer, was described as long ago as 1857 
by Dr. Weinland,- but Miiller had observed it even earlier. 

The habits of particular species of snakes are referred to uikUt the 
respective heads.

Head slightly depressed and continuous with the body. Snout blunt 
and rounded, overlapping considerably the lower jaw. A large rostral 
plate. One or two nasals. One ocular shield, which extends to the 
labial border. Medial row of scales extending over the head to the 
rostral. I^ostrils lateral, oblong, situated between the nasals. Eyes 
covered by continuous epidermis. 

This genus is found throughout tropical Africa and America, and it 
embraces a considerable number of species in all the faunal regions of 
the latter. These are of subterranean habits, which are little known. 
Some of them are said to inhabit ants' nests. One species is known 
from India. 

Three species are known from our fauna. They differ as follows: 

a. Supraorbital scales present. 

Two superior labials in front of the ocular; postocular bounded by three scales 

posteriorly ; colors pale G. dissecta Cope. 

One superior labial in front of ocular; postocular bounded posteriorly by two 

scales ; colors pale 0. dulcis Baird and Girard.

I found the specimen above described in a road at the silver mines 
at Lake Valley, in southern New Mexico. 

The appearance of this species is so similar to that of the G. dulcis 
that I originally identified it with the latter. It is, however, very dif-

from the series representing the frontal. 

Body slender, elongated, rather stouter posteriorly than anteriorly^ 
depressed, broader than deep. Tail very short, subconical, bluntly 
terminated, about one-twentieth of the total length. Rostral rounded, 
tapering, separating the nasals for nearly their whole length. Nasals 
proportionally large, entirely separated by the nasal suture, tapering 
upward, aud undulating. Inferior nasal subtriangular, nostril situated 
ou the middle of its upper margin, close to the frontonasal. Eye shield 
large, irregularly obhmg, extending to the top of the head from the

margin of tbe jaw. Postocular and parietal similar, transversally elon- 
gated, the parietal somewhat larger. Four shield-shaped scales in a 
longitudinal series between the i)arietals, postoculars, eye shield, nasals 
on eacli side, and the rostral in front, occupy the i)lace of the vertical. 

On the crown, and just above the eye 
shield, is a small semilunar plate, sepa 
rating it from the series just described, 
thehomologueof the supraorbital. The 
margin of the upper jaw is formed in 
front by the rostral ; on the sides next 
to the rostral by the nasal, behind which 
is a subquadrangular, obliquely ele- 
vated labial, limited above by the fronto- 
nasal, and posteriorly by the eye shiekl, 
which enters likewise in the upper labial 
series. Posterior to the eye shield is a 
subtriangular labial at the angle of the 
jaw, approximating above the postocu- 
lar, and limited behind by the parietal 
and the beginning of the scales. Inferior labials five, similar to the 
scales under the throat. 

The scales present a great uniformity throughout the whole length 
of the body; a little smaller beneath than above. 

This species ranges from central Texas to the Red River on the east 
and southward along the Rio Grande in Texas as far as San Antonio.

COLUBROIDEA. 

Five well-marked divisions are embraced in this suborder, as follows: 

I. Chevron bones with distinct hjemapophyses. 

Rudimental posterior limbs; no grooved teeth; generally two lungs.. Peropoda 

No rudimental limbs or grooved teeth ; one lung rudimental Aglyphodonta 

No rudimental limbs; a posterior maxillary tooth or teeth, grooved; one lung 

rudimental Glyphodonta 

No rudimental limbs; an anterior tooth with a tube for poison duct; one lung 

rudimental Proteroglypha. 

II. Chevron bones complete, forming hjemal spines. 

No rudimental limbs; a tubular tooth in front of mouth; one principal normal 
lung and a tracheal lung Platycerca. 

It is questionable whether the Aglyphodonta and Glyi)hodonta 
should be retained as distinct from each other. Most of the penial 
characters found in the one occur in the other, and it remains to ascer- 
tain whether these, or the grooving or not of the teeth, are to be con- 
sidered to be of primary importance. For the present I follow the 
example of Dum^ril and Bibron, and Boulenger. 

PEROPODA.

Two pulmonary lungs, no tracheal lung; nasal bones distinct; a corouoid bone;

Witbiji this family the characters of tlie lieinii)eni.s vaiy consider- 
ably. The plica' are more or less undulate, and in some genera they 
fuse at intervals, producing pockets which sometimes approach the 
character of calyces. The sulcus, and generally the entire organ, is 
bifurcate. The i)lica' may also be represented at the apex by distinct 
l)apilla'. The genera which I have examined present the following- 
characters :

The species of the Pythoniute are restricted to the Pahfotropical, 
Ethiopian, aud Australian realms except those of the single genus Loxo- 
cemtts Cope, which inhabit Mexico and Central America, within the 
Nootropic realm. 

The only genus of Boin;e which is known to enter the boundaries 
of the Nearctic realm is Hchmiura. It is i)0ssible that the Boa impera- 
tor has been seen in the valley of the Lower Rio Grande, but of this 
positive evidence is as yet wanting. This species and Epicrates angu- 
lifera of Cuba, and also species of Ungalia are occasionally introduced 
into the country in bunches of bananas. The serpent winds itself tightly 
around the stem, and is concealed from view until the fruit is being 
removed. Unless of large size, these snakes are harmless.

tical. Nostril between two plates, the anterior in contact with that of 
the opposite side upon the median line. Frontonasal suture extensive. 
Posterior to these, the ui)per surface of the head is covered with smooth 
scales. Labial plates without pits. Scales smooth, broad, i)oreless. 
Spurs conspicuous. Gastrosteges narrow. 

In this genus the tail is less prehensile than in Boa, but is more so 
than in Erij.r and Charina. It also differs externally from the latter 
genus (with which Garman at one time proposed to unite it) in the 
absence of the frontal plate and the i^arietals adjacent to it. An impor- 
tant osteological difference is the presence of the coronoid bone, which 
is wanting in Chariyia. 

The species of this genus are variable in their details both as to 
squamation and coloration. I distinguish three species. Dr. Stejue- 
ger has named another, which he subsequently withdrew. In his latest 
study of this genus this author distinguishes the species as follows: 

A. Eye large; its diameter more than oue-third distance from anterior cauthus to 
tip of muzzle ; gastrosteges about 218. 
Whitish with three blackish brown longitudinal bands in strong contrast. 

L. trivirgata. 

AA. Eye smaller; its diameter one-third or less the distance from anterior canthus 

to tip of muzzle; gastrosteges 224 to 241. 

Color brownish or bluish above, with or without longitudinal bands, which 

when present contrast but little with the ground color ; true loreals 3 ; scale 

rows 39-43 ; rostral not prominent L. roscofusca. 

Color as above; true loreals 2; scale rows 35; rostral prominent L. orcutti.

Scales of the body in forty to forty-five longitudinal rows, the inferior 
a little larger than the others. Eight to ten scales in the ocular ring; 
superior lal>ials fourteen or fifteen, the anterior three highest. Loreals, 
three superit. r vertical, two inferior horizontal. Ro.stral plates slightly 
prominent, ele zated, recurved, quinquelateral, its labial border as long 
as its nasal. In/arior labials fifteen, the anterior five longest. A short 
mental fissure. 

General color pale yellowish, tinged with brown. The belly and 
flanks are irregularly specked with liver brown. Superiorly there 
extend from the muzzle to the end of the tail three deep liver brown 
bands, the median four and the two lateral, five scales wide, separated 
by intervals three and a half scales in width. 

The coloration of this handsome boa is altogether unique in the 
family. It calls to mind the Salvadora of the same region. It inhabits 
the southern region of Lower California, where Mr. J. Xautus has

LICHANURA ORCUTTI Stejneger. 

Liohanura orctitti Stejneger, Pioc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XII, 1889, p. 96, fig. 1 ; 1891, 
p. 513.— Cope, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1892, p. 592. 

Dr. Stejneger thus describes this species, which is the form most dis- 
tinct from the L. trivirgata: 

Scales in thirty-three to thirty-five rows; eye encircled by nine or ten scales; 
loreals four; labials thirteen to fifteen; gastrosteges, two hundred and thirty-two; 
anal entire ; urosteges forty-five, entire. 

Rostral plate very prominent, recurved, pentagonal, its nasal border twice as long 
as its labial; eye surrounded by a ring of scales of nearly equal size, ten on the right 
side, but only nine on the left ; between the posterior nasal and the middle preocular 
two large loreal scales, and under the posterior one, wedged in between it, the 
middle and lower prefrontals, and fourth, fifth, and sixth supralabials, a somewhat 
smaller subloreal; over the posterior loreal a superloreal of medium size; nasal 
divided, the anterior i^late meeting the one of the other side; back of these a pair 
of rather large anterior prefrontals followed by four smaller posterior jirefrontals, or 
what corresponds to these plates where a frontal exists, the outer ones being larger 
thau those in the middle; posterior to these the head is covered with numerous 
rather irregular scales; supralabials thirteen, the first four highest; infralabials 
fifteen, gradually diminishing in height from the pair joining the triangular men- 
tal; mental fissure separating four pairs of scales; scales of body smooth, in thirty- 
thr<>e to thirty-five longitudinal rows, the inferior on each side slightly larger than 
the Ti'st; gastrosteges narrow, two hundred and thirty-two; anal small, entire; 
tail short, blunt; urosteges forty-five, entire.

Dimensions. — Total length, 870 mm. ; length of tail from anus, 110 mm. ; diameter 
of eye, 3 mm. ; from tip of muzzle to anterior border of eye, 11 mm. ; proportion of 
last two measurements = 1 : 3.7. 

Coloration. — Ground color light bluish gray, with a light brownish wash on the 
upper surface; three longitudinal ill-defined, zigzag bands of a pale raw umber 
brown running the whole length of the body, the middle one starting between the 
eyes running to the end of the tail, the lateral ones starting on the temporal region 
becoming obscure on the tail; top of muzzle and occasional blotches between the 
bands ol' the same color ; whole underside, except the gulars, mottled irregularly with 
blotches of a dark neutral tint. 

Of the forms which compose this genus the present species appears to be the most 
highly differentiated, the most distinctive feature being the elongation of the snout 
and the prominence and shape of the rostral. From the L. trivirf/aia, myrioJepia, and 
simplex group, it differs more particularly by the low number of scale rows and 
loreals.

Muzzle rather elongate; extremity depressed, rostral plate reflected 
backward above, but not separating internasals. These are about 
equal in dimensions to each of the two pairs of the prefrontals, and 
like them are not separated from each other by scales on the median 
line. The frontal would be a semicircle were it not that the anterior 
border presents a very obtuse angle forward. This border is continu- 
ous with the anterior border of the superciliary, which is not the case 
in the C. botUc. The posterior prefrontal passes in front of the single 
superciliary, and its posteroexternal border occupies more of the bor- 
der of the orbit than <loes the preocular below it. The parietal is a semi- 
circular band, and it is followed immediately by the usual type of 
scales. The anterior prefrontals rest at their extremities equally on the 
preocular and the postnasal. The former is trapezoidal, and is about 
as high as long; the latter is a little longer than high. The prenasal 
is very small. Superior labials eight on one side and nine on the other; 
the eye resting on the third, fourth, and fifth on one side, and on the 
same phis the sixth on the other. Two postoculars. Three or four 
pairs of geneials of about the same size as the gular scales. Scales of 
the body in forty-five rows. Tail short obtuse, Avith a dermal cap scale.

The single small si)eciuien described above stauds quite outside the 
wide range of variation of the G. hottw, presenting characters which 
might be and have been considered to be of generic importance. The 
separation of the prenasal, and absence of the loreal plates can not, 
however, be so used in this group in my opinion.

Noue of the North Araericau specimens have the internasals separated 
on the middle lino by a scale, as is stated to be the case in the type of 
G. hottfc by Bocourt. Several have the prefrontals separated by scales, 
however, so that the character of the type specimen is probably only 
an individual variation. There is no reason to snppose that the ITppor 
California species ditlers from that of Lower California. I give the 
following notes, which I took from Blainville's type in the IMuseum 
of the Jardin des Plantes in 18(54, by permission of Prof. Anguste 
Dumeril: 

The tail enters the total length 9i times. Frontal nnieh wider than long, post- 
nasal and loreal longer than wide. One jjreocnlar. Ten superior labials, second and 
third touching loreal, fourth, fifth, and sixth entering orbit. Forty-three rows of 
scales, size gradnating smaller from first to third. A reddish tint in the pale brown 
of the belly; aliove slaty brown. 

The specimen agreed in size and characters with the one described by 
Blainville, :;ud I am therefore at a loss to nnderstand the acconnts 
given by .Jones aixl Boconrt. The former says ' there are but tliirty-

nine rows of scales on the body, and the latter says, perhaps by a typo- 
graphical error, twenty-nine. Bocourt also says that at the period of 
his writing,' 1882, the specimen was no longer in good condition. It 
was in good condition at the time of my examination in 1864. 

The Wenona isaheUa does not appear to me to differ specifically from 
the other forms. Its head plates display a peculiarity which is also seen 

in a si)ecimen from California. 
(See table, pages 728, 729.) 

This species ranges through- 
out the entire Pacific district, 
as well as the Lower Califor- 
luan. The most eastern point 
from which the U. S. National 
Museum has procured spec- 
imens is the John Day River, 
of Oregon. It has been also 
obtained in the Great Basin on 
the Humboldt River, Nevada. 
I once took a specimen of the 
Gharina hottce near the shore of 
Summer Lake, in Oregon. It was lying in the road stretched at length, 
but with its muscles alternately knotted, so as to resemble a root. It 
was very tame and allowed itself to be handled to any extent without 
attempting to bite. A specimen in the U. S. National Museum contains 
a small mammal which it had eaten. Another individual was in the act 
of swallowing a Sceloporus when captured and preserved in spirits.

UNGALIIDi!^;. 

In TJngalin tlieie aro no plicae, and in IJ. melanura tliere are only 
ibur small papilhi' systematically arranged. The sulcus and organ are 
furcate. 

No species of this family occur in North America. They exist prin- 
cii)ally in the West Indies. 

AGLYPHODONTA. 

The three families of the Aglyphodonta are as follows: 

Two pulmonary lungs; no trarbcal luug; a coronoid bone Xenopeltid.k. 

One imlmonary lung and a tracheal lung; no coronoid bone; postorbital bone pro- 
duced forward over the orbit NoTHOPiDyE. 

One pulmonary lung with a rudiment of a second; rarely a tracheal lung; no coro- 
noid bone ; poatfrontal bone not produced over orbit Colubrid^. 

XENOPELTID^. 

Eyes not covered with a plate ; head with normal shields, with an interparietal added; 
scales smooth ; anal and subcaudals divided; teeth equal .. A'ewoj>eZ<is Reinwardt. 

Tjje family Xenopeltidie also belongs to the Pahijotropic realm. 

I have been unable to determine the penial structure of the only 
species of the Xenopeltidie, tjje Xenopeltis unicolor Reinwardt, as all of 
the four individuals accessible to me are females. 

NOTHOPID^. 

There are two subfamilies of this family: 

No gastrosteges or urosteges Acrochordin.e. 

Gastrosteges and urosteges present Nothopin.«. 

Of the members of these subfamilies I have only examined the hemi- 
penis of Chersydrus granidatus Cuvier. This bifurcates, but not deeply, 
and the surface below the bifurcation is smooth. The branches are 
delicately and not closely spinous. 

ACJROCHortDiisryE;. 

Body compressed, acute below Chersydrus Cuvier. 

Body round, flat lielow 4crochordus Hornstedt. 

The species of this family are of aquatic habit, and live in the rivers 
of the Malayan Peninsula and tlie islands of Sumatra and Java. But 
three are known.

But three si)eeies constitute this fViniily, XenodermuH JavanUiis 
Reiuwardt, from the Malaysian Archii)elago 5 the N'othopsis rvgomis 
Cope,' from the Darieu region of New Grenada, and StoUczlmia Ichasi- 
ensis Jerdon, from S. India, 

COLUBRID^. 

The natural divisions of this family are clearly indicated by the 
characters of the hemipenis for the greater part. The characters of the 
vertebnecan not, however, be neglected, and the dentition in a general 
way corresponds with the results thus attained. Thus the type of. 
penis with simple sulcus and well developed ruches includes the large 
isodout ground snakes and their allies. Tlie types" with furcate sulcus 
with ruches or disc, are nearly always diacrauterian in dentition. The 
Natricine hemipenis is always associated with continued vertebral 
hypapophyses. The smooth or plicate hemipenis is very seldom asso- 
ciated with such hypapophyses. 

1 repeat here in the main the groups indicated in my prodomous of 
1893, with the omission of the glyphodont genera. As I have not had 
access to some of the Oriental and African genera, it ma}' be necessary 
to introduce some changes into some of the groups which include those 
genera. I also now regard the disciferous type as of equal value with 
the others. 

I. Hypapophyses restricted to the anterior part of the vertebral cohimu. 

a. No tracheal lung. 

Hemipenis spineless, smooth or plicate or papillose only Calamahin/E. 

Hemipenis with apical disc ; no calyces; spinous; sulcus furcate.

Hemipenis calyculate, spinous ; sulcus simple ; no disc COLUBRiNiE.

II. Hypapophyses present to the caudal region. 

Hemipenis smooth, not spinous Anopi.opiiallin^. 

Hemipenis spinous, without enlarged basal book LycodontiN/E. 

Hemipenis spinous, with enlarged basal hook or hooks \ai p.iciN.E. 

By far the greater number of snakes belong to the family ColubridiTi. 
They represent all types of relation to the environment; for some are 
aquatic, and others are terrestrial, some living on the surface of the 
earth and others burrowing beneath it. Others are more or less arbo- 
real, some ascending to the summits of the tallest trees of the forest, 
and rarelj^ descending to the earth. iSTone of them are dangerous to 
man, excepting that some of the larger species could cause the death 
of children by constricting the neck so as to cause suffocation; bnt 
this accident rarely occurs. Most of the species disappear at the sight 
of man. 

OALAMARINJE. 

The genera of this group are of various external forms,' and the 
hemipenis presents considerable variety of structure.

Any one familiar with these genera will perceive that they are not 
represented in a linear series in the table. He will also observe that 
genera of probably not very close affinities are placed close together, 
as, for instance, Tretanorhinus and Eelicops and their associates. This 
is, however, a necessity of an artificial key and is not new in zoology. 

The species of this subfamily are all American, and mostly neotrop- 
ical. The following genera are found in the Medicolumbian fauna: 
Garplwphiops, Ahastor, Farancia^ Biadophis, Bhadincea, Heterodon. Of 
these, all are characteristically nearctic except Bhadincea, which is 
neotropical. Of the remaining genera Hypsirhynchus and Neomacer 
have been only found on the island of Santo Domingo, while Adromicus 
and Halsophis are principally if not entirely West Indian. Amastridium, 
Pliocercus, and Ninia are Central American and Columbian, while 
Tretanorhinus is the only genus which belongs both to this region and 
to the West Indian. Relicops is confined to the Brazilian district, 
where it is represented by a number of species. 

The fusiform types are Pseudoeryx, Babidosoma, Carphophiops, Abas- 
tor, and Farancia. The rest are more or less colubriform, except 
Uromacer, which is very slender, including only tree snakes.

dle. No anteorbital. Orbit bounded in front chiefly by the loreal, which 
is largo, and slightly by the prefrontals. Scales smooth. Postabdom- 
inal scutella bifid. Subcaudals divided. 

This genus is the North American representative of the neotropical 
Rhabdosoma and the typical forest burrowers. The species are gener- 
ally found under stones, and under and in rotten logs, and under the 
bark, where they readily make their way, forcing their sharp muzzle 
into narrow places with much muscular strength. 

Cari>}iophiops has exactly the plate and scale formula oi Ahastor^ but 
the hemii)enis is simple and not bifurcate. It resembles that of Aha.slor, 
however, in having the sulcus bifurcate, and the apex furnished with 
calyces in moderate number. 

The two species of the genus difter as follows: 

Temporal scales 1-2; light color of belly uot extending to third row of scales; back 
paler ('. amwnus. 

Temporal scales 1-1; light color of belly extending to third row of scales; back 
darker C. verntis.

{C. helenfc Keiinicott), and bj' some otliers a distinct genus. There is, 
however, no other cliaracter by which to separate it from the C. (tmroiHs, 
and the character itself is not constant. Thus, in jar Cat. liio. 8840, from 
Union County, Tennessee, one specimen has both internasals, a second 

has but one, and a third is without. 
In jar Cat. No. 12046, from Mount 
Carmel, Illinois, nearly all the spec- 
imens lack the internasals, but one 
of them has the plate on one side. 

Some other variations .occur. 
Thus, in a sj^ecimen from Jackson, 
North Carolina (Cat. Xo. 1921), the 
anterior angle of the frontal plate 
is produced forward to the interna- 
sals, completely separating the pre- 
frontals. In Cat. JSTo. 10721, from 
Washington, District of Columbia, 
there is but one, a large scute, in the 
second row of temporals; and two 
rows of scales are of the color of the 
abdomen, which contrasts strongly 
with thatof the dorsal regions. The 
specimen is quite intermediate between this species and the C. vermis. 
In some specimens the superciliary is larger than the postocular; in 
others the reverse is the case.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



This species always possesses the internasal plates, so far as our 
knowledge extends. The posterior geneials are always distinct, though 
smaller than the anterior. 

The distribution of the species is in the southwestern part of the East- 
ern region. According to Mr. Julius Hurter it is to be found near St. 
Louis. It occupies tl)e lower ground, while the G. amoenus in the same 
neighborhood is found in the higher ground.

1887, p. 53.— BouLENGER, Cat. Snakes Brit. Mus., II, 1893, p. 289. 

Head subconical, continuous with the body. Cephalic plates nor- 
mal. One nasal, grooved beneath the nostril. No anteorbitals. One 
loreal together with the prefrontals constituting the orbit anteriorly. 
Teeth equal. Pupil circular. Scales smooth. Postabdominal scutella 
bifid. Subcaudal all bifid. Hemipenis bifurcate, each apex with a 
moderate number of slightly serrate calyces. Spines numerous. 

The penial characters of this genus show that it belongs to the Dro- 
micinte, near to Carphopliiojis, as I already suggested in 1895.' The 
bifurcation of the organ distinguishes it from that genus. It resembles 
that of Faranciain all essentials, the smaller and more numerous spines 
offering no greater difference than that which occurs in various genera. 

This genus is represented by a single species, which inhabits the 
southern part of the Nearctic region. It is thus characterized: 
Scales in 19 rows; superior labials, 7; tail one-seventh of total length or shorter, 

bluish black, with 3 red stripes above; below, flesh-colored, Avith a series of 

bluish-black spots on each side A. erythrogrammus.

This species belongs to the Austroriparian region, but has not been 
found up to date as far west as the Mississippi Eiver. I detected it in 
1895 on the Pamunkey Eiver, in Virginia. This locality has always 
been regarded as within the Carolinian district, so that the locality is 
unexpected.

This species is a burrower, and is allied to CarphopTiiops, as I first 
pointed out. The Pamunkey Eiver specimens were dug from a clay 
bank beneath ten feet of sand. Mi. Clarence B. Moore, in his excava- 
tions of Indian mounds in Florida, has dug it from nearly as great a 
depth beneath the surface, in sand. This species and the Farancia 
ahacura are the largest of the burrowing Dromicinse.

Dr. E. W. Shufeldt found this species abundant near New Orleans. 
He says that it is generally found in swampy ground, or on the shores 
of water, coiled beneath logs and other objects. It is of a gentle dispo 
sition and grows to a considerable size, one specimen sent by him to 
the U. S. National Museum measuring nearly 6 feet in length. The 
species ranges to southern Indiana.

DIADOPHIS Baird and Girard. 

Diadophis Baird and Girard, Cat. N. Amer. Kept., Ft. 1, Serpents, 185.3, p. 112. — 
Cope, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., No. 32, 1887, pp. 54-80. 

Head uonual, distinct from body. Teeth of maxillary bone subequal 
and in an uninterrupted series. Palatine teeth present. Cephalic plates 
normal; rostral normal; two nasals; one loreal. Scales smooth, unifos- 
.sate. Anal i)late and subcaudal scuta divided. Hemipenis simple, with 
numerous simple calyces and numerous spines. 

Diadophis is allied to Dromieus, but in that genus the last sui)erior 
maxillary tooth is longer and follows a toothless space, the scales are 
pitless, and the hemipenis is bifurcate. Rhadincea agrees with Dia- 
dophis in dentition, but i.as no scale pits, as in Dromicus, and the 
hemipenis is capitate. Both of these genera are neotropical in distri- 
bution. The species ot Diadophis are ^JTortli American in distribution, 
except one from the Bahama Islands. It is, however, not unlikely that 
other species will be referred to this genus when the characters of 
their scale pits shall be known. 

The Korth American species of Diadophis are difficult to define, 
owing to their variability. If exceptions to definitions were to be 
chiefly considered, all might be regarded as one species. They are 
easily seen to have been of common origin at no very remote j)eriod. 
The number of labial scuta is variable in all of the forms; the number 
of rows of scales is much less so. The width of the yellow neck collar 
is very variable; in the D. regalis it may be present or absent. The dis- 
tribution of the spots on the belly, whether regular or irregular, coin- 
cides with other character quite closely, but the absence of the median 
series from the form with three rows is of no significance. The light 
or dark color of the dorsal region characterizes geographical varieties 
of each of the three North American species. The species are charac 
terized as follows : 

I. Tail long; urosteges 119; temporals 1-2. . 

Scales in 17 rows; superior labials, 8; ligLt reddisli brown above, white below; 
unspotted D. ruhescevs. 

II. Tail short; urosteges not more than 60; temporals, 1-1; generally a collar. 

Scales in 17 rows; superior labials, 7; labials, throat, and belly, irregularly 

• spotted I), regalis. 

Scales in 15 rows; superior labials, 7; labials, throat, and belly irregularly 

spotted 7J». amahilis. 

Scales in 15 rows; superior labials, 8; labials, throat, and belly unspotted, or the 
belly with a median series of spots D. imnctatus. 

The Diadophis rubescens Cope,Mnhabits tiie Bahaman Island of New 
Providence. The D. punctatus is restricted to the eastern region of 
Nearctica; the D. amabilis belongs to the Central, the Pacific, and the 
Sonoran, while the D. regalis is Sonoran, extending its range as far 
south in Mexico as the Tierra Templada of Vera Cruz.

Body above bluish slate color to deep blackish brown; beneath yellow- 
ish wliite, with crowded small black spots. Occipital ring narrow. 
Dorsal scales in 15 rows ; labial plates 7 above ; oculars, 2-2 ; temporals, 
2-2-2. 

Head, body, and tail slender; head flattened above; body subcylin- 
drical; tail subconical and tapering into a point. Frontal plate sub- 
pentagonal, less tajiering posteriorly than in D.punctatus, and subacute. 
Occipitals narrow and elongated. Prefrontals as in D. punctatus. 
Superciliaries narrower and nearly of the same width throughout their 
length. Upper labials, seven; sixth largest. Lower labials, eight; 
fifth largest. Scales rather short, subelliptical, considerably larger on 
the sides than on the back, especially the outer row. Numerous small 
spots are scattered all over the lower part of the body, from the head 
to near the end of the tail. The upper surface and sides of head are 
blackish brown. The ground color of the abdomen is orange in life. 

This species exhibits the same range of color variation as in D. regalis, 
with some exceptions. Thus there is a light bluish form and a blackish 
form, the former western, the latter more eastern. I have seen no 
specimen without a nuchal collar. The specimens are always smaller 
aud more slender than the fully grown D. regalis. These forms are 
distinguished as follows: 

Color above bluish, orange below and on two rows of scales D. a. pulcheUus. 

Color above bluish to the gastrosteges D. a. docilis. 

Color above blackish brown to the gastrosteges; labials brown; ventral spots

rJiadophis imnctatus pulchellua Cope, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila,, 1883, p. 27. 

Body above greenish brown, the scales minutely dotted with black. 
Beneath deep orauge-red, with small black spots irregularly scattered 
all over, from head to near the end of tail. Occipital ring margined 
anteriorly and posteriorly with a narrow black line. 

Head small, body proportionally long and subcylindrical; tail conical, 
and very much tapering. The frontal plate is subpentagonal, and still 
less tapering, and less acute 

than in the preceding spe irT\ jf^i<. i 

cies. Superciliaries as in I>. 
a. amabilis. Scales subellipti 
cal, elongated. Outer rows 
larger than the rest, which 
diminish toward the dorsal 
line. The bright color of the 
abdomen extends to the two 
external rows of scales, which 
are unicolor, the spots of the 
abdomen scarcely passing be- 
yond the scutelhe, although 
a series of very small spots 
may be followed along the up- 
per edge of the second dorsal rows of scales close to the color of the 
back. The upper labials and lower jaw are yellowish white. 

I obtained a specimen of this very pretty form in Shasta County, 
California, in which the inferior sunfaces are without spots, and a second 
from the same locality is in the U. S. National Museum, in which the 
spots are very few. The B. a. intlchellus passes into the D. a. amahiUs, 
since, in Cat. No. 11786, but one row of scales is colored like the 
abdomen.

The following descriptioi) is tliat of P>air(l and (liraid, taken from the 
typical specimens: 

Color above blackish brown down to the gaatrosteges. 

Head, body, and tail very slender; head flattened al)ove; body snbcylindrieal; 
tail siibconical and tapering into a point. Vertical plate subpentagoual, less taper- 
ing i)osteriorly than in />. punctatnn, and 
subacute. Occipitals narrow and elon- 
gated. Frontals as in />. punctatus. Su- 
perciliaries narrower and nearly of the 
same width throughout their length. 
Upper labials, seven; sixth largest. 
Lowerlabials, eight ; iifth largest. Scales 
rather short, subelliptical, considerably 
larger on the sides than on the back, es- 
peciall}^ the outer row. Color of the ab- 
domen extending to the outer row of 
scales, the posterior portion of which 
alone is black. Nutiierous small spots 
are scattered all over the lower part of 
the body, from the head to near the end 

of the tail. The upper surface and sides of head, as well as the labials of both jaws 
and chin, are blackish brown. The abdomen, in life, is in all probaliilities purplish, 
judging of it from traces of that color left beneath the tail of one of the specimens 
preserved in alcohol.

are of darker color above than either the I), a. docilis or D. a. pulclielhis, 
resembling" the i). piDictatus. This color is, however, only present on 
the apex of the scales of the first row in one specimen, and on the 
apices of those of the first and second on the other, thus approaching 
the I), a. jmlchellus. The abdominal spots are large, ijumerous, and

p. 250. 
r>. punctatus stictogenys Cope, Check-list N. Ainer. Batr. Rept., 1875, j). 37. 

The regular arrangement of the abdominal spots in three rows 
approximates this form to the D. punctatus. In fact, it only differs 
from it in the possession of but seven labial plates, and a speckled 
lower labial and giilar region. As occasional specimens of I), punctatus 
are found with only seven superior labials, the approximation is close. 

The number of rows of 
scales is fifteen ; the super- 
ior labials are seven, eye 
resting on third and fourth, 
as is sometimes the case 
in punctatus. Color above 
light brownish olive, a 
broad yellow collar, bord- 
ered witli black as in punc- 
tatus. Each gastrostege 
has a brown dot at its ex- 
tremity, and the central 
part of the margin the same color, forming a series of transversely 
elongated spots. Fifth and sixth upper labials each with a brown dot. 
Symphyseal and lower labials with a brown dot in the center of each, 
two on each anterior geneial, one at the posterior end of postgeneials 
and of all the throat scales. 

This form has a distribution confined to the Gulf States, extending 
from Texas eastward to Savannah, Georgia.

sometimes narrower. Upper labials yellowish, like the lower jaw and 
inferior surface of head and abdomen. A series of dark subtriangular 
spots along- the lateral margins of the scutellfc, and in contact with the 
dark color of the flanks. Abdomen either unicolor or provided with 
series of similar dark spots along its middle region, from the anterior 
third of the body to near the anus. The spots sometimes elongate 
transversely in the shape of bars across the abdomen. 

A specimen from Anderson, South Carolina, exhibits a somewhat 
slenderer head, and a narrower and more elongated frontal plate. 

Another very young specimen from Mississippi has a shorter head, and 
a frontal plate proportionally much broader and shorter.

or bark of fallen trees, chiefly in forests. It is very harmless, and makes 
no hostile demonstrations. It lives on insects, batrachians, reptiles, 
etc. A Floridan specimen contained an Etujystoma carolinense. 

The specimen on which I proposed the species Biadophis dysopes is 
somewhat abnormal. The internasals and prefrontals are rather wider 
in proi)ortion to tlieir length than usual and the frontal plate is smaller 
in relation to the superciliaries. The nuchal collar is narrower than 
usual, covering only a part of a scale. Approximations to the scutal 
characters are seen in other specimens, and the width of the collar is 
not uniform. Until more is known of the form I let it remain with the 
D.punctatus. Its habitat is nuknowu. 

A specimen with narrow collar interrupted on the middle line of the 
nape was described as a distinct species by Dr. Giinther under the name 
of 7>. occipitalis. A similar specimen has come under my notice. It is 
referable to the D.punctatus.

754 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

RHADIN^^A Cope. 

Bhadinaa Cope, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1868, p. 132; Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc, 
1886, p. 487; Journ. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1875, p. 138. — Boulenger, Cat. 
Snakes Brit. Mns., II, 1894, p. 160. 

Posterior maxillary teeth little louger, or not longer tliau the anterior; 
hemipenis undivided, with more or less papillose calyces at the apex, 
the whole calyculate surface presenting a free margin (capitate), from 
below which the sjjines issue. Cephalic plates normal; two nasals and 
one loreal. Postabdominal and caudal scuta divided. Scales smooth, 
poreless; colubriform. 

This genus is represented throughout Mexico and Central America 
by numerous species, and perhaps in South America, but the penial 
characters of the species of the latter region referred to it are unknown. 
None of tliem are of large size, and they frequently display ornamental 
colors. The type is R. ohtusa Cope. 

A single species enters the United States, which has V)een found so 
far only in the southeastern part of our country. 

Some of the species of Rhadincea have a pseudopreocular plate, a 
character which I find generally constant. The division of the large 
preocular is, on the contrary, inconstant. 

Boulenger has referred to this genus the species placed by Dumeril 
and Bibron in the genus Liophis. These must be omitted, as I have 
shown that they possess the penial characters of the Xenodontinse. 
The following synopsis includes all the species which I supi)ose to be- 
long to the genus so far as known: 

I. Scales in fifteen rows (eight superior labials). 

Postoculars, three; four inferior labials in contact with pregeneials; brown,

Sci. Mex., Rept., 1890, p. 710, pi. xlv, fig. 1. 

The following description is copied from Giinther, as no specimen has 
come into my hands: 

Scales smooth, in seventeen rows, many with a small apical groove. Form of the 
head as in Coronella hvvia; body and tail mi)der:itely slender. Eye of moderate 
size; the rostral does not extend to tlie upper surfaces of the head ; anterior frontals 
scarcely half as large as posterior; vertical longer than the snout, but shorter than 
the occipitals, which are rounded behind; loreal square; one prcorbital, reaching 
to the upper surface of the head, but not extending on to the vei-tical; two post- 
oculars; seven upper labials, the third and fourth entering the orbit; temporals 
1 + 24-3, the anterior in contact Avith both ])Ost()culars; two pairs of chiu-shields, 
nearly equal in length; veutralsl63; anal bifid; subcaudals 95. 

A lead-colored baud, three scales broad, runs from the nape, along the median 
line of the back, to the end of the tail; flanks reddish, with a very indistinct gray- 
ish streak along the fourth outer series of scales ; two yellow lines across the rostral, 
the lower runs along the upper labials and across the neck, thus entirely encircling 
the head; the upper runs along the cauthus rostralis, and stops or terminates in the 
temporal region. Lower parts uniform yellowish. 

One specimen was in a <'ollection made by Dr. Doorman, in the neighborhood of 
the City of Mexico. It is 21 inches long; head 6 lines; tail 7 inches. 



756 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

The deutition of this species is neither distinctly diacranterian nor syncranteriau. 
The maxillary is aimed with nine teeth, gradually becoming stronj;er, longer, and 
more widely set behind; the last is conspicuously the longest, but scarcely more 
distant from the penultimate than this is from the antepenultimate, although these 
three teeth are much more distant than the others are from each other. 

RHADINiEA FULVIVITTIS Cope, 

Ehadinaa ftilviviUls Cope, Journ. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1875, p. 139. 

Head small, iiot very distinct from body. Frontal a little longer 
than the suture from it to the nasal, and a little shorter than common 
suture of occipitals, two-thirds as wideas long. Kostral small, low ; post- 
nasal higher than long; loreal as high as long. Superior labials eight, 
seventh highest; temporals 1-1. Inferior labials ten, sixth largest, in 
contact with middle of post geneials. Scales poreless. Gastrosteges 
one huudredand seventy-seven; anal divided; urosteges ninety-one. 

Color above fulvous, below fulvous yellow. The three brown bauds 
extend from the end of the nose to near the end of the tail; the lateral 
involves the fourth and the half of each adjacent row of scales, and is 
black edged; the dorsal is three and two half scales wide and is also 
black edged. The brown is paler on top of the head and the ground 
color is a narrow, yellow baud to the eye. Lips yellow, like the lower 
surfaces, unspotted. 

This species is allied to the U. vittata Jan, with which Boulenger 
unites it. The absence of the pseudopreocular, and the short loreal 
plate, do not agree with the specimens of the latter.

The following description I have copied from Peters, as covering the 
characters of the species thoroughly : 

Head and body elongate, the latter covered with 17 longitudinal rows of pitless 
scales. Rostral much wider than high, scarcely reaching the superior surface of the 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKEvS. 757 

muzzle; postnasal higher than preuawal shield; freual much loiifjer thau high; j)ari- 
etals about half as much longer as the median frontal, which is about the length of 
the muzzle. Supralabials eight, of which the fourth and fifth are in contact with 
the eye; one anteorl)ital, two postorbitals, which are in contact with an elongate 
temporal; two pairs of submentalia, of which the hindmost is perceptibly the 
longest; ten infralabials, of which six are in contact with the submentals; gastro- 
Hteges one hundred and fifty-five, one divided anal and one hundred and eight divided 
urosteges, or 172 + 1 + 91" 

Gro md color brown. A broad longitudinal dark brown or black line covers the 
three median dorsal rows and the half of each of the external rows in contact with 
them, or, it is composed of three separate longitudinal stripes, of which the median 
is bordered on either side by a series of small, obli<|ue streaks on the external border 
of the median row of scales and the inner edges of the scales of the rows bordering 
it on either side; on each side and continuous with the transverse rostral band, a 
lateral, longitudinal black stripe passing through the eye to the end of the tail, 
which is separated from the median dorsal line by two half, or one and two half 
scales, the line itself two half scales wide, or descending to the third lateral row 
and embracing two entire and almost two half rows. The brownish-yellow stripe 
which separates the dorsal from the lateral stripes begins at the muzzle, interrupted 
by the eye and passes backward along the external border of the parietals. Pos- 
teriorly on the external «nds of the ventrals there is a black point, which form lat- 
eral punctated lines on the anterior ventral side. Dirty yellow ventrally and on the 
supralabials. 

Behind a series of shorter and nearly isodont teeth, separated by a diastema, 
there follows a longer smooth tooth. 

Total length, 505 mm. ; head, 16 mm. ; tail, 177 mm. ; width of head, 85 mm. ; 
width of body, 9 mm. : in another specimen : Total length, 325 mm. ; head, 12 mm.; 
tail, 91 mm. 

The specimens which have couie under my observation have been of 
the color variety in which the median brown dorsal band is represented 
by three narrow stri})es, of which the median is the narrowest. One of 
these came from the State of Puebhi and the two others from Zacual- 
tipan (Hidalgo) from Dr. S. Bernard. It was on these tliat I proposed 
the name R. quinquelineata. 

According' to Giinther this species is coimnon in the high lands of 
Guerrero, and Boulenger gives it from Jalisco and the City of Mexico. 
All of these localities are at an elevation of 8,000 feet or more. Duges 
gives Guadalajara. 

From the stomach of a specimen from Zacualtipan I took an adult 
Spelerpes leprosus.

This band to the last labial is bordered above by a yellow stripe, which 
does not join the yellow stripe on the side of the neck. It is dark 
brown, bordered above. Head above light brown, with two yellow 
brown -bordered parietal spots such as are usually jiresent in water 
snakes. 

Measurements. — Total length, 385 mm. ; tail, 99 mm. 

This species approaches e({ually several species, but differs from all 
others. It combines a long body and short tail, with large and few 
^inferior labials, as in R. fulviceps^ which is a long- tailed species, with 
a different coloration. 

We owe tliis species to Sumichrast, who states in his notes that he is 
not sure of the locality where he obtained it, but thinks it is Orizaba.

times darker tipped. Head dark brown, darkest behind, with numer- 
ous but obscure paler vermiculations. Sides of head i)ale with a 
reddish-brown band from the rostral plate through the eye to the 
middle of the last labial. Labials whitish, with black dots on the pos- 
terior, in oblique rows. Below white, lower labials sparsely black

This is a snake of rather feeble character. I observed a specimen 
from Fort Macon, North Carolina, which I owed to my friend, Dr. H. C. 
Yarrow, for several months in conlinement. It M^as rather inactive. 

The Rhadinwa flavilata has been found along the southern Atlantic 
coast region from southern North Carolina to southern Florida. It is 
more common in the latter region than elsewhere.

Dentition jdiacranterian. Caudal scutella divided ; anal plate double. 
Eostral plate recurved, with transverse upturned edge aud ilat antero- 
inferior face. The nine cephalic plates, a loreal, two nasals and ocular 
plates present, with one or more supplemental behind the rostral. 
Scales keeled, bifossate. Pupil round. Form robust. Hemipenis 
bifurcate, the apices with numerous papillose calyces, and separated 
by a free margin from the spinous portion. Spines numerous, hooked. 
An enormous diverticulum of the left lung extending to the throat. 

The few species of this genus which are known agree also in having 
a series of scales separating the eye from the superior labial plates, 
and in having an azygous plate behind the rostral. The postero-superior 
aspect of the rostral plate has a keel on the middle line, and there are 
from three to live, generally four, scales in the first temporal row. 
The tail is short. The anterior ribs are capable of extension so as to 
flatten that part of the body, as is done by the cobras of the genus 
Naja, but the expansion is not so wide, and it has greater longitudinal 
extent. The postgeneial plates are reduced to a very small size, and 
are separated from each other by small scales. 

The species of this genus range throughout North America except- 
ing the Pacific region. They do not extend far into the Sonoran, and 
are absent from the Lower Californian and the Mexican regions. They

hiive no representatives in ecjuatorial America or the West Indies. A 
genus Lystrophu Cope', is found in subtropical and temperate South 
America, which resembles HeUrodon superficially, but belongs to the 
Xenodontida'. A genus occurs in Madagascar [Anomalodon Jan) 
which agrees su])erflcially with Lystrophi.s^ but dififers in having an 
entire anal shield, but belongs by the penial characters to the Lyco- 
dontinae. 

The species of Heierodon have some peculiar habits which indicate 
greater intelligence than most other snakes possess. They throw 
themselves into remarkable contortions when alarmed, and expand 
their anterior ribs, inflate their lung, and open the mouth widely. 
They do not attempt to bite from the ground, but the long posterior 
maxillary tooth may be used with considerable effect if the snake is 
carelessly handled. The trowel-shaped rostral plate enables them to 
excavate sand with ease, and in such soil they are usually most 
abundant. 

Three species of this genus may be distinguished as follows : 

I, No accessory scales about the azygous plate. 

Scales in 25 rows ; rostral plate less developed ; larger H. platyrMnus. 

II. Accessory scales about the azygous scuta. 

Scales in 25 rows; stouter, smaller; an inferior nasal plate; one row of lateral 
spots; belly white in adults H. sivius. 

Scales in 23 rows; smaller, more slender; no inferior nasal scuta; two rows of 
lateral spots; belly more or less black H. nasicus. 

The H. platyrhinus ranges throughout the Eastern and Austroripa- 
rian regions, and the H. simus inhabits the Austroriparian only. The 
H. nasicus is divided into two subspecies, one of which extends over 
the Central and the other over the Sonorau regions.

aiiterioi- to tbe middle of tbe chord connecting the apex of rostral and 
posterior end of labials and over the middle of the fifth labial. Outline 
of upi)er jaw convex. Lower labials, eleven. 

Body stout and short. Tail very short, and rapidly tapering, rather 
thicker than the thinnest part of the body. Dorsal rows twenty-five. 
Scales all distinctly carinated (including those on the back of the head), 
excei^t the outer two or three rows, which are either perfectly smooth, 
or present very obsolete carination. 

Color reddish brown above, with dark blotches. A series of twenty- 
eight quadrate, dorsal, uniform black blotches from head to anus, each 
from two to three scales long, and seven to nine wide, separated by 
regular brownish-yellow intervals of one and one-half to two scales. 
The blotches anteriorly are nearly square, posteriorly they are trans- 
versely elongated. Opposite the intervals, and, indeed, bounding them 
on either side, is a second series of small circular blotches on the fourth 
to the eighth lateral rows, and separated only by a narrow interval 
from the corner of the dorsal blotches. Sometimes there are faint 
traces of small blotches between the upper lateral series. Intervals 
between the lateral rows of blotches yellowish or reddish brown, darker 
than those on the back; outer dorsal rows greenish or yellowish white. 
On the tail there are fifteen black half rings, interrupted on the sub- 
caudal scutella?, the scales on the tail larger than on the greater part 
of the body. In young specimens there is distinctly visible a second 
series of still smaller blotches, below the one just mentioned, there being 
two of these opposite each one of the former, and placed on the second, 
third, and fourth exterior rows. Beneath greenish yellow, with obso- 
lete greenish-brown blotches, indistinctly visible through the epidermis, 
sometimes more conspicuous in young specimens. 

There is a transverse black or dark bar on the forehead, crossing the 
posterior half of the postfrontals, involving only the anterior edge of 
the vertical, and the anterior corners of the superciliaries. Behind 
this a dark patch, with its anterior margin a little back of the middle 
of the vertical, and involving the adjoining margin of the supercilia- 
ries and occipitals, together with the greater portion of the occipitals; 
sometimes with a light spot in the middle; the light space included 
between the two ]>atches appears to extend continuously backward to 
the neck; above, a dark vitta from the back j^art of the orbit to the 
posterior labial, itself a continuation of the frontal vitta. An elongated 
narrow vertebral spot behind the junction of the occipitals, and gen- 
erally isolated from them, on each side of which is a similar patch 
widening behind. 

This species is subject to great variations of color. Sometimes the 
sides of the dorsal blotches pass insensibly into the ground color, so as 
to become transverse bauds. At others they are light internally, with 
a narrow margin of black. Occasionally there is much black on the 
abdomen (in young specimens). The ground color varies from gray to

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSRUM, 1898. 



bright yellow, aud sometimes even red. It may also liaj)peu tliat, by 
the confluence and extension of the darker margins, we have light bars 
on a dark gronnd, as on a specimen from the Scioto Valley, Ohio, 
where, with the other characters similar, the color is of a dark brown 
above and on the sides, with transversely (luadrate brownish ash-col- 
ored spots along the back, some one and a half or two scales long, nine 
or ten wide, and at intervals of about three scales. Of these spots 
there are twenty eight from head to anus, and about nine on the tail, 

wheic they form half 
rings, with intervals a 
little larger than them- 
selves. 

About forty specimens 
display the normal col- 
oration. In eleven the 
lateral spots of the first 
row join the spots of the 
median row, inclosing 
the light intervening 
dorsal spaces as spots. 
In four other specimens 
this fusion is imperfect. 
The light spots have ac- 
quired so dark a shade 
as to have disappeared 
in the black color variety, called by Dr. Holbrook Heterodon niger. 
Among numerous specimens of this form in the national collection 
there are two (Cat. Nos. 1168 and 9105) in which traces of the usual 
spots remain. 

One specimen of this form is a true lead color, with a black band 
extending posterior to the orbit (Cat. No. 16189). 

The specimens on which Baird and Girard proposed the name Hete- 
rodon atnioides differ from the normal form in a less production of the 
free acute edge of the rostral plate. No other character reenforces this 
peculiarity, and it intergrades with the usual type. It can be looked 
upon only as an individual characteristic. Individuals of this kind 
are more frequently sent from the eastern part of the Austroriparian 
region than elsewhere. 

The specimen on which the H. cognatus (Cat. No. 1271; Indianola, 
Texas) was proposed by Baird and Girard is lighter colored than usual, 
but not otherwise different, except in the possession of only two tempo- 
rals in the first row on each side. The absence of the small superior 
temporal is not by itself indicative of important diversity.

I find the caudal scutelljB to vary in number from thirty-nine to fifty- 
two in nine normally colored specimens, and from forty-two to fifty six 
in five black specimens. 

The Heterodon platyrhmus^ when disturbed by man, throws itself into 
vigorous contortions, spreads the anterior ribs, and opens the mouth 
widely, after the manner of a venomous snake. If turned on its l^ack 
and its abdomen be gently stroked, it will sometimes lie quietly in that 
position for a long time. I once observed the singular conduct of an 
individual which was kept in a cage with a water snake {Natrix sipe- 
don) and a copperliead {Ancistrodon contortrix). Both of the harmless 
species were evidently greatly frightened on the introduction of the 
copi)erhead into the cage. The water snake sought the lowest si)ot in 
the sand on the bottom of the cage, and coiling up, kept close to the 
ground, not even raising his head. The Heterodon, on the contrary, 
inflated his long lung, swelling the greater part of his body into the 
form of a cylindrical bladder. He at the same time extended the ante- 
rior ribs, so that this part of his body resembled the thin blade of a 
paper cutter. He then plunged its nose into the sand and covered the 
top of his head with as large a pile of that substance as it would carry. 
In this disfigured condition he paraded slowl}' about the cage in front 
of the copperhead. The latter moved but little, and showed no dispo- 
sition to provoke a quarrel with its singular companion. 

Prof. O. P. Hay^ has collected the following facts in regard to the 
breeding habits of Heterodon phityrhinns, the hog- nosed snake, viper, or 
spreading adder, as it is popularly known : 

Dr. J. Schneck, of Mount Carniel, Illinois, reports ' that eighty-seven young spotted 
spreading adders were taken from the body of a wounded female. The author of the

766 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

note did not see this done, hut got his information from persons who did see it. I 
am strongly inclined to believe that the reptile was a Tropidonotns sipedoti. Another 
writer' in Pennsylvania gives an account of over one hundred young snakes issuing 
from a wound in tho side of a female spreading adder. These young were each from 
6 to 8 inches in length and all were active and blowing vigorously. Neither did the 
author of this note soe the escape of the snakes, although he did see sixty-three of 
the young in alcohol. There may easily have been an error in the determination of 
the species to which these young snakes belonged. One who has examined the eggs 
of this species can not easily believe that so many young snakes could, with such 
readiness, escape from a wound in the mother's side. Moreover, these snakes deposit 
their eggs in the earth some time before the young are ready to lead an independent 
existence. 

Dr. Bumpus - states that a female Heterodon in the National Museum brought forth 
111 young, but Dr. Bumpus informs me that he did not himself observe this. 

Prof. F. W. Cragin reports'' the finding, on September 10, of 22 eggs of this 
species ; they were buried in the sand at East Hampton, Long Island. Two of the 
eggs which he had in his possession hatched four days afterwards. Troost appears 
to have dissected a black specimen, in which he found 25 eggs. Dr. C. C. Abbott 
says^ that he has frequently in May found the eggs of the hog-nosed snake in con- 
siderable numbers a few inches below the surface of the ground, and in early July 
he onco found a family of 17 very small and apparently just hatched young. These 
resented all interference, snapped, hissed, and flattened their heads precisely as an 
older snake would do. The size of the young is not given, but on another page (p. 
295) he implies that they were less than 4 inches in length. I think that this spe- 
cies, like most other species, produce their young rather late in the season, but I see 
no reason for not believing that some individuals may bear their eggs over the 
winter and lay them in the spring. 

A female (Cat.No. 17951, U.S.N.M. ), sent me from Veedersburg, Fountain County, 
Indiana, contained 15 eggs, the posterior 4 of which lay in the left oviduct. I could 
discover no signs of embryos. Each egg was covered by a thick, tough, yellowish 
coat, inside of which was a thinner and more delicate membrane. 

Through the kindness of Dr. L. Stejneger, curator of the department of reptiles in 
the National Museum, I have been enabled to make some observations on the eggs 
and living young of this Heterodon. On the 31st day of last August there were 
brought into the laboratory of the department from some point in Maryland not far 
from Washington a lot of 27 eggs, which the finder said were the eggs of the copper- 
head. It was reported that the eggs were thrown up out of the ground by the plow, 
and that the mother snake was near by and had resented the disturbing of her 
treasures. She had been killed, but had not been sent along with the eggs. Since 
it was supposed that the copperhead produces living young, the occupants of the 
laboratory were anxious to learn if this opinion were erroneous. Accordingly one 
of the eggs was opened, and in it was found a young hog-nosed snake, fully devel- 
oped and ready to assist himself on the scene of action. This Heterodon (i[uitc closely 
sesembles the copperhead, and most people are not accustomed to make nice dis- 
tinctions among snakes. This close resemblance may account for some of the 
statements of the large number of young jirodnced by the copperheads. ' 

The eggs referred to were between 1^ and 1| inches long and about seven-eighths 
inch in short diameter. The egg covering was thick, tough, and flexible, resembling 
a piece of parchment. There is little if any deposit of lime in it. Of these eggs, 
some were found to have hatched during the night of September 6; others, which 
were buried somewhat deeper in some clay, escaped from the eggs later, but all were 
out by the afternoon of the 8th. The length of such as were measured varied

between 7 .and 8 iuchos. From tlii^ nionuiut of escape from the egg al] were quite 
active, and manifested many of the characteristics of the adults. Some of the little 
fellows were quite saucy, and would make a pretense of striking at the approaching 
finger, but their efforts in that line were rather feeble. A faint hiss was sometimes 
uttered, but that may not have been voluntary. One would sometimes flatten its 
head and bodj^ and rear up with the anterior third of its length free from the ground. 
If one did not know well their iuoll'eusive natures, one would be excused for fearing 
to handle them. An extremely singular habit possessed by the adults is that of 
feigning death. On being struck or teased, they Avill roll over and over, as if in the 
inteusest agony, and then throw themselves on the back, and lie there as if dead. 
Out of some fifteen of the young experimented with, I succeeded in getting only 
two or three to go through with this performance, but these did it to perfection. 
On being lightly struck a few times, they would turn over on the back, writhe about 
a while, and then lie perfectly still. If turned right side up they would again turn 
on the back. If left undisturbed for a little while they would turn over and creep 
slyly away. The others of the young would not act in this way, however much 
they were teased. It would be interesting to know whether all the adults possess 
this odd habit, or only a portion of them. 

The cuticle of the young Heterodons is shed very shortly after their escape from 
the egg coverings. Within a few minutes after one had left its prison the skin was 
observed to be broken about its head. It had left the egg at half past 1 and by 4 
o'clock the skin was pushed back half the length of the body. The next morning 
the skin was wholly shed, revealing the brighter colors of the new skin. While get- 
ting rid of the cuticle the little fellow kept crawling over the clay and among the 
roots of the grass. 

The opportunity was embraced to observe the use which is made of the egg tooth. 
The tooth itself is easily seen in the just hatched snake. Its lateral borders are 
more nearly parallel than those of the tooth of Bascanion figured by Weinland. Seen 
from the side, the anterior or upper outline is concave, the posterior outline convex. 
Thus the tooth projects forward and is slightly turned up. The anterior face is also 
concave from side to side, so that there is, on each side, a distinct cutting edge. The 
tip is cut oft' square. The tooth appears to have a ligamentous attachment, and may 
be lifted a little, but not much depressed. It seems quite evident that the tooth is 
first engaged in the egg covering, and then made to do its work by a forward push 
of the head. An examination of the covering, after the snake had left it, gives 
ample proof that it has been cut and not merely torn. The edges are as smooth as if 
they had been slashed with a razor. A long slit is sometimes made as if by a single 
effort. In other cases several attempts appear to have been made before the cover- 
ing has been open enough for the snake to get out. In one or two cases a tooth has 
not been inserted deeply enough, and the only result was a scratch on the inside 
of the covering. The egg tooth having performed its office becomes loose and drops 
out. This occurs usually within twenty-four hours. 

When the slit has been successfully made, the little snake may sometimes be 
seen pushing its head carefully out as if to survey the surroundings. Should there

I have been able to collect some facts concerning the i)airiug of the sexes of Hete- 
rodon. platirhinon. Prof. U. O. Cox, of Mankato, Minnesota, informs me that he found 
two individuals uniting some time in May. A second male was entwined with the 
two other snakes. The latter were separated with difficulty. The male intromit- 
tent organs are described as being of an oval form, an inch long, and over half an 
inch thick. 

Two observers have seen black specimens, formerly called H. niger, pairing with 
the spotted individuals. Prof. W. S. Blatchley • found a black and a si)otted one 
copulating on April 19. He speaks in a letter to me of the intromitteut organs as

being as large aa waluiits and covered with spines. Mr. E. R, Quick, of Brookville, 
Indiana, an accurate observer of nature, writes to me that he once found a black 
viper pairing with a sjiotted one. The time, he thinks, was late in June. The time 
of gestation of this species is not known. It may continue from spring until 
autumn. Possibly the late-pairing individuals may retain their eggs until the next 
spring. Nor do wo know how long the eggs are laid before they are ready to hatch. 
These matters are known concerning very few of our snakes, and a wide iield is 
offered for work and observation.

Abbeville, South Carolina. 

Cat. No. 1197, U.S.N. M. 

Frontal plate as broad as long, generally longer than the parietals. 
Eostral broad and liigb. Azygos encircled by three to five small plates. 
Mouth very short. Dorsal rows twenty- five, the three or four externals 
smooth. Dorsal series of thirty-five blotches, with one alternating 
series on each side. Abdomen yellowish, scarcely maculated. A nar- 
row black band across the forehead in front of the frontal and passing 
through the eye across one labial to the angle of the mouth. 

Frontal plate subheptagoual, sometimes nearly triangular ; with three 
sides anteriorly, the lateral against the prefrontals, the middle against 
the azygous plates, the sides very obtusely angled. Superciharies rather 
short, broad. Parietals very short, almost as long as broad. Pre- 
frontals moderate, the exterior angle scarcely reaching the angle of the 
loreal; the two separated by three small plates posterior to the azygos. 
Internasals not mucli smaller. Azygous plate resting anteriorly against 
the rostral and touched by the inner angle of the internasal. There is 
a small plate on each side, between it and the notch at the junction of 
the anterior and prefrontals, while behind, the space between it, the

prefrontals, and tlie frontal is occupied by the three small plates already 
mentioned. This azygos is thus surrounded on the sides and poste- 
riorly by three small plates (this number is sometimes greater). Rostral 
broad and high, much recurved. Eyes moderate, situated posterior to 
the center of imaginary line connecting the last labial and rostral, 
which would pass nearly through its center. Loreal subtriangular, 
acute above, scarcely reaching to the exterior angle of the postfrontal, 
a small plate sometimes intervening. Nasal plates rather short and 
high ; nostril occupying most of the posterior one, its infero-anterior 
wall constituted by the first labial, its lower by a small inferior nasal 
plate. Labials eight above; in one specimen of the six examined, there 
are seven; they increase very rapidly from the diminutive first; fifth 
and sixth largest; all much higher than broad. Lower labials nine. 
Curve of upper jaw very convex and short. Temporals four on both 
sides in five specimens; three on both sides in one. 

Scales back of the head short, curved, obsoletely carinated. Dorsal 
rows of scales twenty-five, outer rows smooth, sometimes only three, 
the carination slight, increasing to the medial row. Scales shorter and 
broader than in the other type, becoming narrower on the back; those 
behind rather narrower than before. Body contracted at the anus, 
then expanding or swelling on the tail, which is thick throughout, taper- 
ing to the tip. Scales on the tail longer and broader than those of the 
upper part of the body in front; carination not very distinct, inferior 
three rows truncated behind, especially the highest. 

A dorsal series of transverse black blotches, thirty-five from head to 
tip of tail, the twenty- seventh opposite the anus. These are sometimes 
oblique, but generally transverse, and with the anterior and posterior 
margins parallel. They are about nine scales wide and three to four 
long, with light-brownish yellow intervals one or one and a half scales 
wide. On each si;^e and opposite the intervals is a distinct series of 
subquadrate or circular black spots on the sixth to ninth rows, not 
touching those on the back, and between them a dusky shade opposite 
the dorsal spots. Below these again are usually two smaller blotches 
to each spot. Intervals between the spots mottled yellowish-brown. 
Beneath yellowish, with obsolete small brown blotches. On the tail 
there are nine half-rings rather wider than the light intervals and 
somewhat contracted above. 

A narrow black line crosses the forehead on the posterior half of 
the prefrontals, and just margining the frontal; this passes through 
the center of the eye and is continued to the posterior labial. A medial 
patch of black, expanding behind, starts from the commissure of the 
parietals, from which plates others, one on each side, pass across the 
angle of the jaws, the three confluent with the dark color in the parie- 
tals. In H. platyrhinus this medial patch is isolated and not in contact 
with the occipital one. 

Some specimens from Abbeville, South Carolina, vary in having the

rostral separated from the prefrontals by two or three small plates, and 
the azygos entirely cut ott' from the internasals by intervening plates. 
The lower wall of the nostril is constituted by two small plates; there 
is a second small plate above the loreal; in fact, a general tendency to 
break up into small plates. The markings on the back are restricted 
to a dorsal series, with a dusky shade opposite, and a lateral series 
opposite the light yellowish intervals; the ground color of the sides a 
quite uniform yellowish brown. Specimens from Mississij^pi have the 
dorsal spot smaller and nearly circular. 

This is the most robust and the shortest species of the genus. Its 
range is the Austroriparian region, omitting western Texas, where the 
H. nasicus replaces it.

HETERODON NASICUS Baird and Girard. 

Heterodon nasicus Baikd and Girard, Cat. N. Amer. Rept., Pt. 1, Serp., 1853, p. 61. 
Heterodon simus nasicus Cope, Clieck-list N. Amer. Batr. Rept., 1875, p. 43. 

Frontal and parietal scuta usually wider thau long, the parietals 
often shorter than the frontal. Head short ; rostral plate very large 
and strongly recurved. No inferior nasal i)late cut off from the post- 
nasal. Two or more loreals. Inferior labials* eight, all much higher 
than long. First row of temporals generally four. From tliree to 
twenty-four accessory scales beside and behind the azygous plate. 
Scales in twenty-three rows, all keeled except the first three on each 
side. Proportions of body more slender than in IT. ,simus. 

Color light yellowish-gray above, with a medium dorsal series of 
rather closely jjlaced brown spots and with two alternating series of 
brown spots on each side. Three brown short longitudinal nuchal 
brown bauds and a brown band from each eye posteriorly. Belly 
either entirely blaf^k cr tessellated with black and white. 

Tliis is the Western representative of the H. simvs, to which it is 
nearly allied. It can be always distinguished, however, especially in 
its typical subsj^ecies, by the characters given. A single si^ecimen out 
of tlie many in the U. S. National Museum (Cat. No. 4961) from Texas 
displays an inferior nasal plate. 

Two forms of the H. nasicus inhabit different regions and maybe 
regarded as subspecies. 

Scales accessory to azygous plate two or three ; loreal small or wauting ; belly black 
and white spotted H. n. Jcennerlyi. 

Scales accessory to azygous plate from eight to twenty-four; loreals generally two; 
belly nearly entirely black H. n. nasicus.

111 the R. n. Icennerlyi in three out of six specimens the parietal scuta 
are shorter than the frontal. In sixteen of the H. n. nasicns, ten speci- 
mens have the i)arietals shorter than the frontal. In the small number 
of accessory scales the H. n. lennerlyi approaches nearer the H. sinius 
than does the R. n. nasicus. The same affinity is indicated by the 
smaller amount of black on the belly. It represents the genus in the 
Sonoran region, while the R. n. nasicus occupies the Central. 

HETERODON NASICUS KENNERLYI Kennicott. 

Reterodon kennerlyi Kennicott, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1860, p. 336. 
Heterodon simus kennerlyi CouES and Yarkow, Herp. Dak. and Mont, in Bull. 

U. S. Geol. Surv. Terrs., IV, 1878, p. 271.— Jan, Icon. Gen. Ophid., Pt. 10, 

pi. V, fig. 2. 

Head broad, very short anteriorly. Eostral plate very large. Loreal 
plate very small, sometimes absent. Only two supplemental plates 
behind azygos; the latter is sometimes replaced by two symmetrical 
contiguous plates and without any supplemental The iuternasal and 
prefrontal in contact with the posterior process of the rostral. Dorsal 
row of scales twenty-three, all carinated except the first and second, 
which are perfectly smooth. Ground color light yellowish-gray; a dor- 
sal series of rather indistinct rounded or subquadrate brown blotches; 
a second series of smaller circular spots much darker and more dis- 
tinct; below this a third and more indistinct series. 

In its general form and appearance this resembles the Reterodon 
nasicus nasicus, with which it is sometimes found associated. The body, 
however, is rather shorter and thicker than in that form, and the head 
is broader, with the part of the head anterior to the eye decidedly 
shorter. The nasals are not as well develpped longitudinally as in R. 
n. 7iasicus, but the result of this shortness of the anterior part of the 
head is seen in the very small loreal, which is frequently wanting 
entirely. There is never more than one loreal, while frequently two are 
seen in R. n. nasicHs, in which the loreal is in every case strikingly 
larger than in R. n. Icennerlyi. The most striking difference in these 
species is in the number of small plates surrounding the azygos, or 
postrostral. While in R. n. nasicus there are always at least ten of 
these, one or two of which margin the inner edges of the ])renasals and 
prefrontals, there are never more than two, and frequently but one, 
additional plate in R. n. 'kennerlyi, and the prenasal and prefrontal are 
always in contact with the posterior process of the rostral. The azygos 
is short, nearly as broad as long, and usually there are just behind it 
two contiguous plates of about the same size separating it from the 
postfrontal, but not from the prefrontal. Frequently, however, the 
azygos is longitudinally divided and ^vitll()ut any additional plates, but 
in contact with the rostral anteriorly and the vertical posteriorly, and 
not separated from the postfroutals. The frontal parietals, supercilia- 
ries, and labials are much as in 77. //. nasicus, thougli generally less 
developed longitudinally. The rostral is as large as in 77. n. nasicus. 



774 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



The two outer dorsal rows are both perfectly smooth; in H. n. nasicus 
the second is distinctly though delicately carinate. 

The ground color is light yellowish grey, with a dorsal series of rather 
indistinct subquadrate or rounded blotches, two to two and a half scales 
long, and separated by intervals of one or two scales, rather wider 
anteriorly. Below this is a series of very distinct purplish black circu- 
lar blotches, covering four scales transversely and two longitudinally; 
below this one or more indistinct series of spots. This pattern of col- 
oration is very similar to that of H. n. nasicus^ but the ground color is 
always lighter and less distinct. The ujjper lateral series is of a pur- 
plish black, and much more distinct, forming a prominent character. 

Abdomen nearly entirely black, except a few yellow scuta. The head 
is marked as in H. n. nasicus except that the nasals, prefrontals, and ros- 
tral are all yellowish, while in the latter species they are dark in front 
of the light transverse line which crosses the crown behind the rostral; 
and in H. n. Tcennerlyi the light line across the superciliaries and vertical 
is much broader than in H. n. nasicus. This species differs from H. n. 
simus in many of the same features as does H, n. nasicus. These, together 
with the small or absent loreal and small number of supplemental plates, 
readily distinguish it.

Heterodon simus nasicus Cope, Check-list N. Amer. Batr. Rept., 1875, p. 43. 

Frontal broader than long. Rostral excessively broad aud high. 
Azygous plate surrounded behind and on the sides by many small plates 
(9-24). A second loreal. Labials short and excessively high. Dorsal 
rows of scales twenty-three, exterior alone smooth. A dorsal series of 
about titty blotches, with four or five others on each side. Body beneath 
black. A narrow white line across the middle of the superciliaries; a 
second behind the rostral. A broad dark patch from the eye to the 
angle of the mouth, crossing the last two labials. 

Frontal plate very broad, subhexagonal. Parietals short. Rostral 
very broad, high, more than in the other species, outline rounded. The 
interval between the opposite frontals, the rostral, and the frontal 
occupied by a number of small plates, from nine to twenty-five, arranged

with symmetry on each side and behind the small azygos. The base 
of the rostral between the opposite anterior nasals is generally mar-

frontal and the anterior portion of the superciliaries. This crowding 
of plates causes the anterior part of the forehead to be broader than 
in H. n. simus. Eye small, its center rather posterior to the middle of 
the imaginary line connecting the tip of rostral with the lower angle 
of the postlabial, which line scarcely crosses the eyeball. Orbital plates, 
ten to thirteen in number. Loreal triangular, rather longer than high, 
separated from the prefrontal by a small second loreal above it. Nasals 
rather short, postnasal bounding the lower part of the nostril. Labials

eight above, all of them higher than long; indeed, their vertical exten- 
sion is much greater than in any other species; the sixth highest, cen- 
ter of eye over the Junction of the fifth and sixth. 

Dorsal rows of scales twenty-three, outer row smooth, rest all dis- 
tinctly carinated, the keels extending to the ends of the scales; those 
Just behind the parietal plates trun(;ated, with obsolete carin;v. Scales 
on the hind part of the body rather broader and shorter than anteri- 
orly; the inequality scarcely evident in large specimens. 

Ground color light brown or yellowish gray, with about fifty dorsal 
blotches from head to ti]) of tail; the thirty-ninth opposite the anus. 
These blotches are (juite small, rather longer transversely, subquad- 
rate, or rounded, indistinctly margined with black, (obsoletely on the 
outside) ; they cover seven to nine scales across, are two to two and

oue-lialf long, and separated by interspaces of one and one-half scales, 
which are ijretty constant throughout, though rather narrower on the 
tail. On each side of the dorsal row may be made out, under favora- 
ble circumstances, four alternating rows of blotches; the first on the 
contiguous edges of the scales of the first and second exterior dorsal 
rows; the second on the scales of the third row, and the adjacent edges 
of those in the second and fourth; the third on the scales of the fourth, 
fifth, and sixth, and the adjacent edges of the third and seventh, and 
the fourth on the scales of the sixth, seventh, and eighth rows, and 
the adjacent edges of those of the fifth. This last is opposite the 
intervals of the dorsal series; the rest alternate with it. The central 
inferior surface of the abdominal scutellte is black, sharply variegated 
with quadrate spots of yellowish white; the portion of the scutellae 
entering into the side of the body is yellowish white, with that part 
opposite the dorsal intervals dark brown, thus, in fact, constituting a 
fifth lateral series of blotches, alternating with the lowest already men- 
tioned. The throat and chin are unspotted. The head is light brown, 
with a narrow whitish line finely margined before and behind with 
black, which crosses in front of the center of the vertical and through 
the middle of the superciliaries; a second similar but more indistinct 
line runs parallel to this, just behind the rostral, and extending down 
in front of the eye. A third equally indistinct and similar line crosses 
the posterior angle of the vertical and runs back on the side of the 
neck, behind the labials and temporal shields. There is a broad brown 
patch from the back part of the eye to the angle of the mouth, across 
the penultimate and last labial. The coloration is thus very different 
from that of H. n. simus, where there is a distinct narrow black band 
across the forehead scarcely involving the vertical, and passing through 
the eye to the angle of the mouth across the last labial. Behind this 
a much broader yellowish band, continued without interruption into 
the neck behind the angle of the mouth. In H. n. nasicus the most con- 
spicuous feature is a narrow white band, much narrower than the 
darker iiatch before and behind it. The dark patch, to the angle of 
the mouth, is much broader, continuous, as it were, with the broad bar 
between the middle and anterior light lines, which corresponds with 
the narrow black line of H. n. shnus. The other distinguishing features 
are evident. The three dark patches behind the head are much as in 
H. n. simus. 

In the larger specimens from Sonora and the copper mines the 
ground color is yellowish gray, each scale minutely punctate with 
brown. The blotches are all obsolete, only one dorsal and two lateral 
on each side being defined by darker shades. The blotches on the 
sides of the abdomen are wanting, but the black in the middle is 
strongly marked. The other chaiacters, however, are ])reserved, except 
that the exterior row of dorsal scales is more or less carinated.

There are three genera of this subfamily, which difl'er as follows: 

Geneial plates jiaired, longitudinal Petalofinathus Diimoril and Hilirou. 

Geneial plates paired, transverse Leptof/nathu.s Dumeril and Bibron. 

Geneial plates inclosing a median shield Mesopeltis Co))e. 

I have referred to this family several genera from the Oriental 
(Paleotropical) Realm, as Parms, A.sthenodipsas, Dipsadoboa, etc.; but 
an examination of the penial and pulmonary structures shows that 
Parem belongs to the Oalamarina', and I susi)ect that the other Oriental 
genera are allied to it. Thus reduced, the Leptoguathinai include only 
Neotropical species, and none of these are found in the West Indian 
district. The species are numerous in the Central and South Ameri- 



778 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

can districts. They are snakes of fragile structure, inhabitants of 
brush, with feeble dentition. The head has the appearance of that of 
a foetal snake, with the sbort nose and large eye. They are said by 
Dum(^ril and Bibrou to live on Mollusca. Their immense tracheal lung 
distinguishes them from the Dromicinae, which they resemble in penial 
characters. 

The hemipenis in LeptognatJms is not bifurcate, but the sulcus is 
deeply so. It is oalyculate from the bifurcation of the sulcus to the 
extremity, and the calyes are fringed. Below them the organ is fur- 
nished with hooked spines halfway to the base. Below them the sur- 
face is smooth. 

COLTJI? Rijsr^. 

This subfamily includes representatives of the Calamarinae, Coronel- 
linoe, Lycondontinse, Colubrinse, and Dryadiuse of authors, and includes 
burrowing, ground, and arboreal types. The group is especially char- 
acteristic of Palearctica and Nearctica, but numerous forms occur also 
in the Oriental, Ethiopian, and Neotroijical realms. There is a general 
similarity in penial structure, the diversities being of minor importance 
and some of them not yet fully understood. I have been able to abol- 
ish the division Coronellinte, which never had any real standing, and 
also to show that Hallowell was right when he referred the Lycodon 
rufozonatus of authors to the neighborhood of Coronella. The genera 
of burrowing habits and generally small size, which were variously 
referred to the Calamarinae and Coronellinse, generally have the ruch- 
ing of the hemipenis reduced and replaced by spines. This is consiiic- 
uous in StyJaso7iia, and especially in Conopsis, where there is but one 
row of calyces, and in AdelpJiicus and Trimetopon, where the cups are 
replaced by unossifled papillae. 

In the typical species of Ophibolus the calyces are much reduced in 
number and replaced by spines. Some genera have the borders of the 
calyces conspicuously papillose, while in others they are smooth, but 
intermediate conditions connect them. In some forms there are smooth 
patches on the apex of the organ, but the value of this character is 
uijcertain. In Cynophis I have found a remarkable apical awn, but as 
I have had the opportunity of examining but one individual, I am not 
sure how constant it is. In the Tropidoclonium Uneatum, where a simi- 
lar character is present, I have found it to be entirely constant. 
I give the following synopsis of the genera which I have been able to 
examine : 

I. Hypapophyses not pierciug CBSophagus. 
* Apical calyces of hemipenis present. 
A. The calyces not furnished with spines, excepting the inferior marginal ones.

Dasypeltis Wagler. 

This subfamily includes the grouud snakes wbicli are characteristic 
of the two great northern land areas, Eurasia and North America, but 
numerous species occur iu the regions to the southward, especially in 
the Oriental and Neotropical realms. The dentition is isodont or cory- 
phodont, between which no line of demarcation exists, although a few 
forms {Zanienis for example) present in some of the species the dia- 
cranterian type. In a few (for example, Binodon) the median teeth are 
longer than those that immediately follow them. In this subfamily, as in 
most of tbe others, a tendency to a burrowing habit and fusiform shape 
api^ears. The beginning of this is seen in Coronella, and iu Ophibolus, 
and it becomes very pronounced iu a number of genera which inhabit 
the warmer parts of North America and the Central American district 
of the neotropical realm. All the truly burrowing genera of the Colu- 
brinse are American, and they display affinities to genera in which this 
habit is less marked. Thus the burrowing Stylosoma is related to 
Ophibolus of the spotted type and Cemophora to the annulate type of 
the allied genus Osceola. Otlier fusiform burrowing genera are Ghilo- 
menisciis, Geagras, Conopsis, and Ficimia. 

On the other hand, the passage to arboreal types is easy. In the 
Oriental region Bendrophis is the typical tree snake, and in Africa we

This species is very constant in the scale formula, preserving fif- 
teen rows in twenty-seven specimens in which I have counted them. 
The labials are always seven, the only exception being a specimen which 
had met with an injury on the top of the head (Cat. No. 1495). The 
fourth labial on the right side and the first and fifth on the left are 
abnormally divided obb'quely. The relation of the loreal to the nasal 
is changed in four specimens on both sides, and in one, on one side, by 
the fusion of the two plates. In two specimens there are two preocu- 
lars on both sides, and in one on one side only. In another (Oat. No. 434) 
the oculars are 2-3. 

The Liopeltis vernalis has a wide range, embracing the entire Eastern, 
Austroriparian, and Central regions. It is found in the hilly parts of 
New Mexico, but is rare in Texas. Florida specimens are higlily col- 
ored. It is in the North that the species especially abound, being- 
much more common in my experience in Massachusetts than in Penn- 
sylvania. Professor Yerrill gives it as commonly found at Norway, 
Maine. It is absolutely harmless.

Head distinct, scuta normal. One nasal plate, one preocniar. Teeth 
equal, smooth. Anal and caudal scuta divided. Scales keeled, bifos- 
sate {C. ccstiviis). 

This genus, like Liopeltis, :s found in the temperate and tropical 
regions of Asia, and in temperate North Aii?f ric.i only. In the Nearctic 
realm its range is mainly the Austroriparian region; but it has been 
taken in the southern part of the Central region, and it ranges also the 
Carolinian district of the Eastern region. But one species is known 
in the Western Hemisphere, which is characterized as follows : 

Scales in 17 rows; superior labials, 7; temporals, 1-2; tail two and one-half times 
in total length. Green above; labials and below, light yellow C. oistivus

The number of scale rows I found to be constantly seventeen in 
thirty-two specimens examined, as also the superior labial i)lates, which 
are always seven. The loreal plate I found rudiniental on one side 
of one specimen, and once confluent with the nasal on one side only, as 
is sometimes the case on both sides in Liopeltis vernalis. I found two 
preoculars on one side in two specimens only. In one there are anom- 
alously three on both sides (Cat No. 1447). In the same specimen there 
are two loreals, one above the other, on both sides. In three specimens 
there is but one temporal of the second row on both sides, and in those 
there is one of the second row on one side only. The length of the

six-sevenths. Cat. No. 7197 ; two and niueteen-twentieths. Cat. No. 14366. 

Baird and Girard have proposed certain individuals as a distinct 
species under the name of Leptophis majalis, on account of the some- 
what shorter tall. Individuals from New Mexico hq,ve shorter tails 
thau those from the Atlantic region, but the gradation in length is 
complete. Floridan specimens differ /rom others in having the keels 
of the scales stronger and in having the second row strongly keeled 
like the third, while it is smooth in other specimens; but no other 
character coincides with this one. 

I have described a peculiar habit of this species.^

Boulenger distinguishes two principal divisions of ground Colubridfe 
as genera under the names Zamenis and Coluber on dental characters. 
In the former tlie maxillary teeth increase in size posteriorly, while in 
the latter the posterior teeth are not longer, and may be shorter than 



788 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

the anterior. That this distinction is valid in many instances is well 
known, but it is admitted by Boulenger that in otber instances the 
transitions are complete. An examination of the penial characters 
leads me to the opinion that each of these groups is a series of genera 
rather than a single genus. Thus in the Zamenis gemonen.sis, the type 
of the genus, we have the normal colubrine structure, from which two 
divergent lines may be traced. In one of these, represented by the Z. 
ventrimaculatus, the calyces preserve their character, but the lew papilLp 
are ossified as acute siMnes, the character defining the genus Acantho- 
calyx. In another direction the walls of the calyces are thickened and 
support several series of papillte. This is seen in the Z. rarergierU. 
In the next type these numerous papillae are ossified, giving us the 
genus Gonyosoma. A greater modification is seen in the Z.JJorulentus. 
Here the thickening of a part of the calyx walls is greatly increased, 
while other walls, including all of the longitudinal ones, disappear. 
The result is a mass of papillose pads, a character quite different from 
anything else in the order and one which defines the genus Tylanthera. 
The explanation of this structure is rendered possible by that of the 
Zamenis ravergierii. 

The North American species referred to Zamenis by Boulenger have 
been separated under the name Bascaniuni by Baird and Girard. 
Most if not all of these species differ from the typical Zamenis gemo- 
nensis in possessing one or two large hooks at the proximal ])art of the 
spinous tract, which remind one of the Natricinie, and which are not 
found in the typical forms of Zamenis. The Drymobiiis jmlcherrimus 
Cope possesses a similar peculiarity, which separates it from the 
typical species of that genus. It differs from the species of Bascaniuni, 
however, in having the large spines distad to the spinous tract and_ 
not proximad. 

The proposition of Boulenger to combine the forms into the genus 
Zamenis, which have been hitherto separated, throws light on tlie sub- 
ject, by emphasizing the weakness of the dental characters regarded by 
Dumeril and Bibron as definitive of the genera so included. My dis- 
covery of the penial characters, however, shows that this aggregate 
includes several genera, which may now be satisfactorily defined. 
Without these Boulenger's Zamenis is as difiicult to define as a whole as 
any of the whole groups which he has included in it. How far some 
of these penial characters are definitive of genera remains in some 
cases to be ascertained. Thus the disposition of the large spines in the 
American species is constant in all of them excepting in the Z. con- 
strictor, where it is not constant; but I have not yet ascertained how 
far this inconstancy goes, or whether it precludes the ultimate adop- 
tion of the genus Bascanium or not. The definition of this group is as 
follows : 

Head distinct; cephalic plates normal. Teeth increasing gradually 
in size posteriorly, not grooved. Scales smooth, in an odd number of

series, with two apical fossa\ Subcaudal scutelhi' in two series; anal 
plate divided. Two preoculars; loreal present; two nasal plates. 
Form elongate. 

The species of this genus are elongate in form and active in move- 
ment, so that the j)opular names of "whip-snake" and "racer" are 
apprdpriate. Although at home on the ground they climb bushes and 
low ti ees, rarely ascending to any great lieight. They are skillful in 
cai)tiiring young birds, as well as small mammals and reptiles. They are 
distributed over all North America south of the boreal region, and are rep- 
resented, like most of our other genera of snakes, by a greater multiplic- 
ity of forms in the southwestern section of the continent. One species 
inhabits Mexico exclusively. The species are distinguished as follows: 

I. Scales in seventeeu rows; superior labials seven. (Frontal plate nearly as wide 
as superciliaries posteriorly; muzzle rather produced; colors not in stripes.) 
Two labials bounding orbit below; form robust; colors generally nniforni, 

always so on lips and throat Z. constrictor Linnanis. 

One labial bounding orbit below; form more slender; more or less spotted on 

the lips and throat Z.mentorarins Dunioril and Bibron. 

II. Superior labials eight ; scales in seventeeu rows. ( Frontal as wide posteriorly as 
superciliary at same point; loreal longer than deep.) 
Rostral plate little prominent; frontal with straight sides not touching pre- 
frontals; loreal subdivided; oiive above, yellow below. 

Z. stcjnef/erianus Cope. 

Rostral plate prominent; frontal with concave sides in contact with preoculars; 

loreal entire; light brown above, pale leaden below Z. conirostris Cope. 

III. Scales in nineteen rows; superior labials eight. (Frontal plate one-half as 

wide as superciliary behind; muzzle narrowed, produced.) 
Slender; above black; below yellow Z.jiageUum piceiis Cope. 

IV. Scales in seventeen rows; superior labials eight. (Fi'ontal plate one-half 

width of superciliaries posteriorly; form slender.) 

Muzzle narrowed, more or less decurved; without or with dark shade or cross- 
spots anteriorly ; young cross-spotted Z. far/eUnm Catesby. 

Muzzle narrowed; ])ale with a latei'al brown stripe anteriorly; young striped; 
no temporal spot Z. aemiihicatus Cojte. 

Muzzle flattened, wider; a yellow stripe on third and fourth rows of scales only ; 
dorsal scales brown ; a yellow temporal spot; belly yellow; lateral stripe con- 
tinuous to origin of tail; throat and upper and lower labials spotted; posterior 
upi)er labials less elongate Z. laieraliif Hallowell. 

As />'. latcrale, but lateral stripe broken up on anterior fourth of length, after 
which a trace only remains; labial ))late8 and throat unspotted; posterior 

labial plates more elongate Z. auri(/iihis Cope. 

V. Scales in 15 rows; superior labials 8 (form slender; color in stripes). 

Muzzle elongate, narrowed; frontal i)late more than half as wide as supercil- 
iaries posteriorly; two lateral yellow stripes on a dark ventral and dorsal 
ground; dorsal scales yellow-edged; no temporal spot.

790 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Some of the species above admitted are nearly allied, and young 
specimens are sometimes not readily referred to their proper places. 
In the first place, although the eyes of young Vertebrata are relatively 
larger than those of the adult, yet the superciliary plates in this genus 
encroach more on the frontal in mature than in young specimens, so 
that in the former the frontal plate is more narrowed posteriorly than 
in the latter. The color characters of young individuals of Z. lateralis 
and Z. toiniatus are sometimes not fully developed, so that their refer- 
ence is difficult. In all of the species the head plates are pale-bordered 
in the young, and this character may or may not be continued to 
maturity in Z. tmniatus. Z. constrictor and Z. flagellum are cross- 
banded and si^otted in youth, but this character disappears except on 
the anterior dorsal region of the latter species, where it is frequently 
retained. 

The species are distributed as follows: 

Eastern region : Z. constrictor. 

Austroriparian region : Z. constrictor ; Z. flagellum. 

Central region: Z. constrictor ; Z. tceniatus. 

Pacific region : Z. constrictor; Z. flagellum; Z. ta^niatus; B. lateralis. 

Sonorau region : Z. flagellum; Z. piceus; Z.schottii; Z. lateralis; Z. 
ornatus; Z. twniatus. 

The number of rows of scales is very constant. Apparent exceptions 
are referred to under the head of Z. lateralis. The number of labial 
scuta is very constant except in the Californian representatives of 
Z. constrictor. The small inferior preocular plate is ver^^ constant in 
Bascanium, its only absence being noticed in a very few specimens of 
the Californian form of Z. constrictor. The temporal scales are always 
normally 2-2-2, and rarely vary from it. 

The anterior and posterior parts of the body are frequently differ- 
ently colored in this genus. This is especially the case with Z. flagellum, 
Z. f. semilineatus, and Z. ornatus, where the posterior region is paler 
than the anterior, and is lacking in the pattern. In Z. constrictor the 
transition from the black to the green variety is first seen in fading out 
of the black on the tail and posterior part of the body. 

As regards the striped forms we have evidence how the young differ 
from the adult in Z. semilineatus and Z. tceniatus. In these the ten- 
dency to form distinct wider bands is stronger than in the adult, where 
they are subdivided and more or less obliterated. Thus the young of 
both these forms resemble more Z. lateralis than do the adults. We 
may then regard Z. lateralis as representing a primitive form for this 
series. The primitive form for Z. flagellum and Z. constrictor was 
probably a cross-banded form, but no such species is>known. In this 
respect the last-named species resemble the species of the genus Dry- 
mobius, where the young are cross banded or spotted. Some spotted 
Drymobii are known where the adults are spotted.

throat white. The young are olive, with rhomboidal dorsal blotches; 
beneath greenish white. 

Frontal plate much longer than broad, pentagonal, anterior margin 
convex, the lateral strongly concave, the plate rapidly diminishing to 
half its length, thence the sides nearly parallel, terminated by a rather 
obtuse angle; a little shorter than the parietals. Snperciliaries large, 
rather broad. Rostral rather broad and high, wedged to a slight 
extent between the prefrontals. Eye large, its center before the middle 
of the commissure and over the fourth labial. The lower anteorbital 
very small, wedged in between the ui)per anteorbital, the loreal,the third 
labial, and the eye. Loreal trapezoidal, oblique, moderate. Labials 
above seven; the first, third, and fifth smaller than the rest, the third 
and fourth entering into the orbit; the fourth the only one in contact 
with the lower postorbital ; sixth and seventh largest. Lower labials 
eight, the fifth much the largest. Two rows of temi)oral sc;iles between 
the labials and occipitals. Exterior row of dorsal scales very large, 
diminishing gradually on the back. Scales very thin, the posterior 
angle moderately truncate, so as to give an elongated hexagonal shape 
to the ex[)Osed portion. Exposed surface of exterior row nearly as 
high as long. 

Color above uniform lustrous pitch black, beneath slate color, some- 
times tinged with greenish white. Lower jaw and chin and sometimes 
edge of the upper labials white. Specimens from the West and South- 
west exhibit a more or less bright olive green with the whole under 
surface greenish white to bright yellow. In one or two specimens 
there is but one anteorbital. 

The young of this species are variegated in color instead of being 
uniform. The ground color is dark olive, with a succession of darker 
rhomboidal dorsal blotches from head to tail. These are about nine 
scales wide, and four or five long, separated by lighter intervals, which, 
narrow along the back, widen of course ra))idly toward the abdomen. 
The edge of ea(;h scale is obsoletely lighter than the center, the dark 
centers in some scales being of such intensity as to produce the impres- 
sion of distinct spots, especially on the sides. Along the vertebral 
region the margins of the blotches are narrowly dai ker, and those of 
the intervals lighter than on the sides. Beneath greenish white, each 
scutellawith from two to four dark spots on the edges. Top of head 
yellowish gray, posterior margins of both pairs of frontals dark chest- 
nut, as are the contiguous edges of the superciliaries and vertical, and 
posterior edges of the superciliaries and occipitals as well as a small 
blotch on the outer edge of the superciliaries, and a broad patch in the 
center of the occipitals running up into the vertical. Sides of head 
white, especially labials and orbitals; tinged with bluish behind the 
eyes, and spotted with dark brown. 

Specimens over 18 inches lose the blotching, and become more and

more uniform, although to a considerable size showing traces of the 
spots on the abdominal scutelhi;. 

Transitions between the Eastern black and the Western green forms 
of this species are frequently met with in the region connecting the 
two liabitats. Thus in Michigan the species is generally of a bluish 
green or greenish blue tint above, and is known as the " blue racer." 
Similar specimens are in the U. S. National Museum from New Orleans. 
On th • yellow bellied form of the Plains, Say proposed his Coluber flavi- 
ventris, which was regarded as a distinct species by Hallowell and by 
Baird and Glrard. I, however, do not find it to be more than a geo- 
graphical color race. The same color characterizes specimens from the 
Pacific district, which are also inferior in size to Eastern individuals, 
and frequently have the head a little shorter. In spite of this fact 
they incline to develop an additional labial plate, the number being 
occasionally in this region eight on one or both sides. Thus of eleven 
black Eastern specimens only two have eight superior labials on both 
sides. Of twenty-two yellow-bellied specimens, three have the labials, 
seven on one side and eight on the other, and nine have eight on both 
sides. Of the twelve specimens thus exceptional, seven are from the 
Pacific region and five from the great basin of Nevada and Utah, of 
the Central region. This is the Bascanium vetustum of Baird and Girard. 
In the type specimen the sixth upper labial reaches the lower postocu- 
lar; but this is exceptional and rarely occurs in Californians or other 
individuals. 

A remarkable color variety of this species was described by me under 
the name of Bascunium anthicum. In this form the general color is as 
in the dark-bluish tinted variety, but numerous scales on all parts of 
the body are a bright yellow. Th > yellow scales are rarely regularly 
arranged, but sometimes show a tendency to a distribution in chevron- 
shape 1 crossbauds. A sjjecimen of this kind was sent me by my friend 
Prof. Pendleton King, from near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The typical 
specimen, which is in the U. S. National Museum, is of uncertain 
locality, but was alleged to have been brought from Siam, most prob- 
ably erroneously. 

Another color variety is represented by a single specimen (Cat. No. 
10481) from Galveston, Texas. It is of the yellow bellied type, but the 
dorsal color is yellowish brown, and small black specks rather sparsely 
mark the gastrosteges, and from two to four inferior rows of scales 
throughout the length. The loreal is as high as long, 

A black Zamenis was described by Baird and Girard as having been 
brought from California, under the name of B. fremontii. The speci- 
men is a typical Z. constrictor, and was taken probably in the Eastern 
region. The B. foxii Baird and Girard is the same.

The Zamenis constrictor is the "black snake" of the East and the 
" blue" and " green racer" of the West. It is everywhere an active, vigor- 
ous snake, getting over the ground or through the brandies of bushes 
with great rapidity. It is courageous, and will sometimes attack, mov- 
ing forward 'with the head raised from 1 to 2 feet above the ground. 
It, however, quickly turns about and runs if the enemy preserves a bold 
front. In confinement it is sometimes quite irascible, showing attack 
on every movement of its captor. It is, however, easily tamed, and then 
takes food, being said to be especially fond of milk. Of all our snakes 
it is the most useful to th© farmer, from the great number of moles and 
mice which it consumes. It is also a robber of birds' nests. 

Dr. Henry Bions gives the following account of the courtship of the 
green racer of the Kansas plains:^ 

The manner of union of the sexes at this season is rather instructive. The female 
among the racers (Bascaninm) is larger aud darker than the males, and not so grace-

fill ill form or movements. She, at times, seems to toy with the male, indisposed to 
yield to his importunities, though pressed with ardor. To avoid his suit, at times, 
she "will dart througli grass, among stones, or enter a crevice. Should he be able 
to reach liis mate while within a hole, he is not slow in bringing her to the surface, 
again to be repulsed. Upon an unbroken ground the sexual communion is less pro- 
longed. Here she is unable to free herself from his quick and effectively directed 
moves. In case she attempts to quit him, a coil is thrown about her body, and his 
head laid Hat upon her neck, and replaced as promptly as dislodged, evidently in 
the endeavor to propitiate her. 

The coustricting power of the black snake is not sufficient to cause 
inconvenience to a man, but might seriously oi)press a child. The pres- 
sure exercised by a strong individual wound round the arm is sufficient 
to conii)ress and close the superficial veins, and cause the muscles to 
ache, but it is easy to unwind the snake with the free hand and arm. 
The black snake is harmless, and its bite, which it rarely inflicts, only 
amounts to a serious scratch.

In the present species the profile is gently convex, and the rostral 
plate is slightly prominent. The frontal plate has straight lateral bor- 
ders, and its anterior angles 
are well removed from the 
preocular plates. The loreal 
is twice as long as deep, and 
its superior posterior corner 
is cut oft" as a separate phite 
on both sides, and on one a 
third loreal is cut off below. 
The eight superior labials 
are regular and apparently 
normal. The parietals are 
truncate posteriorly, and are 
bounded by three temporals 

and two small scales externally. Temjwrals, 2-2-2. Postgeneials 
shorter than pregeueials. Gastrosteges, 1G6; anal, 1-1; urosteges, 102.

light plumbeous below; the top of the head not lighter than tbe other 
superior surfaces. The muzzle is darker in color than the lips and 
throat. Skin between scales black.

This species and the last one are founded on a single specimen each, 
which were obtained in nearly the same region of country. They 
resemble each other considerably in proportions, size, and coloration. 
The differences are, however, so numerous and important that it is 
impossible to regard them as belonging to the same species. They

differ equally from all others, the nearest approach to the Z. stejnegeri- 
emus being made by abnormal individuals of the flavirentriH form of 
Z. constrictor, which have eight superior labial shields. The very differ- 
ent form of the loreal plate, and its subdivision, in the latter, together 
with the contrast between the color of the head and the dorsum, will 
distinguish it. 

ZAMENIS FLAGELLUM Shaw. 

Zamenis flageUiformifi Boulengeu, Cat. Snakes Brit. Mus., I, 1893, p. 389. 

Eight superior labials; scales in seventeen rows. Frontal plate nar- 
rowed posteriorly, only half as wide as the supraoculars at the same 
point. Muzzle projecting slightly conic, profile decurved ; form slender. 
The young with transverse spots, more numerous than in Z. constrictor. 

This widely distributed species is represented by several color forms. 
These may be aggregated into two types or subspecies, which differ as 
follows: 

Colors pale, except in some regions, the head and adjacent parts dark colored. 

Z. flagelluni jlagellum Sbaw. 
Black, except tlie belly, which is pink or yellowish Z. flagellum piceus Cope. 

The typical form occupies the Austroriparian and Sonoran districts, 
while the Z. f. piceum is an inhabitant of the Sonoran only.

rest of the scale more or less mottled with the different shades of 
brown. The darkest tint is usually seen near the tip of the scales, this 
on the tail forming a distinct margin. Beneath, the color is yellowish- 
white, on the anterior fifth more or less blotched with brown or nearly 
uniform brown, posterior to which it disappears more or less entirely, 
being represented only by occasional dashes. The ends of each scutella, 
however, on their margins exhibit the brownish or yellowish blotches, 
and are colored much like the sides of the body at that place. Ante-

The color variations of this species are as follows: In half-grown 
Eastern specimens the head is light brown, with darker cross shades on 
the head and nape. In adult P^astern specimens the head and from 
one fourth to two thirds the length of the body are deep brown. In 
Texan adult specimens the anterior regions are sometimes of a strong 
brown color, but generally they are pale, the top of the head only 
being of a light brown. In adults from the Sonoran and Pacific regions 
the posterior part of the head and several wide cross-bands on the 
nape are of a dark brown or even of a blackish color. In specimens 
from Arizona these are followed by pink cross-bands, which appear 
only on the anterior fourth or fifth of the length of the body. In Cali- 
fornian specimens in the National Museum these j)ink cross-bands 
appear indistinctly. In specimens from La Paz, at the southern 
extremity of Lower California, the entire body is a citron yellow, with 
some black appearing between the scales when the skin is stretched. 
The head and nape are spotted as in the Californian individuals. In 
young specimens from Georgia and Florida, as well as from the West, 
the chin throat and anterior part of the belly for a short distance 
are spotted by ill-defined spots of light brown. These are represented 
by cloudy shades, or are entirely lost in the prevailing brown color in 
Eastern adult specimens. In Texan specimens they disappear entirely 
in some large adults. In Sonoran and Californian specimens tliey con- 
tinue pernmneutly, the spots forming a row on each side of the ante- 
rior part of the bellj^, and blotching the inferior and superior labials. 
The speckled brown of the temporal region is divided by a pale line 
extending from the eye i)Osteriorly. 

In younger specimens the blotching beneath is more decided. In 
addition to tlie colors described, the back is crossed by indistinct bars 
of darker, eight or nine scales wide and half a scale long. This color 
is also seen on the skin between the scales under the dark bars, where 
the bases of the scales themselves are darker instead of liglit. There 
is a tendency toward stripes on the side: First, one of light brown on 
the outer edge of the abdomen; then an interrupted yellow one at the 
junction of the abdominal scutelhc and outer scales; then brown again 
through the centers of the rows. This, however, is not very conspicu- 
ous. Sometimes the dark shades on the sides are linged with reddish. 
The obsolete transverse bars are seen at intervals of one or two scales.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



A Specimen from Fort Webster or Copper Mines shows the stripes 
on the sides much more distinctly, running through all the dorsal rows 
anteriorly, and crossed by the indistinct bars already referred to. The 
contrast between the dark chestnut-brown spots on each side and its 
deeper center, with the clear yellow of the edges, is very distinct. 
Beneath yellov?, with the blotches reduced to mere dull spots. 

Santa Rita del Cobre. (Col. J. D. Graham); gastrosteges, 211+2; nrosteges, 101 ; 
scales, 17; total length, 39J inches; tail, 10| inches. 

Specimens in which the dark cross bands behind the head are very 
pronounced have been referred by Dr. Stejneger to a distinct subspecies 
under the name of Z. f. frenatus. It is true that all specimens from 
west of the Eio Grande exhibit this character, but in Cat. No. 15970 
from Yuma, Arizona, and Cat. No. 4388 from Lajoya, New Mexico, the 
spots are absent, save a few traces only. They are, in fact, a persistence 
of the immature coloration, as is especially conspicuous in tlie type of 
Z. f. frenatus, where the cross bands are present on tlie greater part 
of the length. The character is, to my mind, too variable to offer a 
definition. 

I have met with this species in Texas, where it is abundant. I 
obtained specimens from near Dallas, Houston, Brenham, Helotes, and. 
the upper waters of the Guadalupe and the Llano rivers. Those from 
Dallas, Brenham, and Houston, which are in the rainy region of Texas, 
have the greater part of the length a blackish-brown. Those froin 
Helotes, the Guadalupe, and the Llano are entirely pale clay-color 
This relation of color to moisture is similar to that observed by Dr. 
J. A. Allen to prevail among the rodent Mammalia. This is a swift 
species, and is generally known everywhere as the "whip snake." 

This species ranges south into Mexico on the plateau, and southward 
on the western slope. Thus I have recorded it from Chihuahua, Gua- 
najuato, and Guadalaxara:

This is a remarkable form, as it oc(;upies a position between several 
of the species. Thus it has the scale formula and shape of head of 
Z. Jiagellum, the head coloring of Z. schottii, and part of the coloration 




Fig. 176.

between those of Z. twniatuni and Z. lateralis, and part like that of 
Z.flaf/elhon. Its adult characters ally it most nearly to the last named, 
but its appearance is quite distinct. 

The scales are in seventeen rows, and there are eight superior labials. 
The posterior part of the frontal is only half as wide as the superciliary 
plate at the same point. The temi)oral scales are 2-2-2. The fourth 
and fifth labials bound the orbit below. The loreal is larger than liiiili. 
The postgeneials are a little larg^er than the pregeiieials. The muzzle is 
not decurved, and is moderately protuberant, viewed in profile; from 
above it is elongate wedge-shaped. The tail is long, entering the total 
length in the specimen before me (Cat. No. 1981) three and one-seventh 
times. 

The general color is a light brownish clay-color (in spirits), the free 
border of each scale with an elongate whitish spot on each side. The 
color becomes darker anteriorly so as to be on the anterior fourth of 
the length, a plumbeous green, with the top of the head light brown. 



806 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



There are no markings on the superior surface of this region, but the 
sides are striped, the stripes disappearing on the second fourth of the 
length of the body. These stripes are bounded by a brown line on 
tlie middle of each scale of the second and third rows. Between these 
the color is like that of the back, while the adjacent halves of the tldrd 
and fourth rows are light yellow. A fainter brown line runs along the 
middle of the first row. Belly and throat immaculate light yellow, 
except a few punctoB along the end of the first dozen gastrosteges. 
Middles of nasal, loreal, and pre- and postocular plates yellow. Supe- 
rior labials yellow, with a blackish superior border, extending from the 
rostral plate back. Temporal region like the top of the head, immacu-' 
late. A few black specks ou the geneial margins of the inferior labials. 

Gastrosteges 201, anal 1; urosteges, 134+. Total length (Oat. No. 
]981), 1,185 mm.j of tail (extremity wanting), 375 mm. 

A young specimen (Cat. No. 8434) is interesting as showing the distinct 
ness of the color characters as compared with those of corresponding 
age of the Z. tccniatus and with the adult Z. schottii and Z. lateralis. 
In the first place, the stripes are much more distinct in this specimen 
than in the adults, as is the case also with the Z. tceniatus. Moreover, 
they extend farther along the length of the body, being traceable on 
the middle third, though they are wanting posterior to it. The stripes 
are a yellow one on adjacent parts of the third and fourth rows, bounded 
below by a brown one on the adjacent parts of the second and third 
rows. A yellow stripe succeeds on the adjacent parts of the first and 
second rows, while another and paler brown stripe runs on the adjacent 
parts of the first row and the extremities of the gastrosteges. This 
pattern, it will be observed, is quite different from that which obtains 
in any of the other striped species, as the M. ta^niatus, ornatus, scJiottii, 
or lateralis. The head is entirely uniform greenish slate color above 
and on the temples. The superior labials are yellow, the posterior 
bounded above by a black line from the orbit to the neck. The muzzle 
of this specimen is broken off.

ZAMENIS LATERALIS Hallowell. 

Bascanium tceniatum laterale Cope, Check-list N. Amer. Batr. Rept., 1875, p. 40. 
Lepptophis lateralis Hallowell, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1853, p. 237; U.S. 
Pac. R. R. Report, X, 1859, Williamson's Report, p. 13, pi. iv, fig. 3. 

Form slender, head oval, distinct from body, tail a little less than one- 
third the total length. Scales in seventeen longitudinal rows; superior 
labials eight, the fourth and fifth bounding the orbit below. Muzzle 
not elongate nor decurved, but flattened, and its extremity but little 
prominent. Eostral plate slightly recurved on upper surface of muzzle, 
luternasals as wide as long. Frontal narrowed behind, half as wide 
as superciliary in adults. Parietals truncatemarginate posteriorly. 
Dorsal longer than high. Sixth superior labial truncate above ; seventh 
and eighth longer than 
high. Nine inferior la- 
bials, the fifth largest. 
Postgeneials longer than 
pregeneials. Temporals 
2-2-2. 

Color above, including 
ends of gastrosteges, 
plumbeous brown ; below 
yellow. A yellow band 
extends from the neck to 
varying distances on the 
adjacent parts of the 
third and fourth rows of 
scales. Lateral head 
plates I'rom the preoculars forward, with yellow centers. Superior 
labials with brown splotches above, forming an irregular border, not 
brown bordered below. A yellow temporal spot. 

The posterior labial plates are longer than high, but are not so 
extended as in the Z. aurigulus. The inferior labials anterior to and 
including the fifth are also less eloirgate, the fourth being nearly square, 
while it is parallelogrammic in the Z. aurigulus. The muzzle, and hence 
the loreal plates, are shorter than in that form. The spotting of the 
inferior surface is confined to the chin, throat, and a dozen or so of 
gastrosteges. It consists of scattered brown spots which are nearly 
symmetrical on opposite sides, and which fall into two more or less 
irregular rows, each a short distance within the extremities of the 
gastrosteges. 

The seventeen rows of scales, together with the coloration, distinguish 
this form from the Z. Hchottii and the Z. Ucniatus. Young specimens of 
the latter, however, resemble it closely, since the ^spaces between the 
dark lines of the first, second, and third rows are apt to be solidly dark- 
colored at that age. They may be distinguished, apart from the smaller

number (fifteen) of scale rows, by the different distribution of the lat- 
eral stripes. In Z. I. lateralis the yellow stripe is confined to the third 
and fourth rows, and the dark baud below it covers the extremities of 
the gastrosteges. lu the Z. tcvniatus the yellow stripe extends to the 
fifth row of scales, and the inferior band only reaches to the middle of 
the first row, not attaining the gastrosteges. In Z. schottii the supe- 
rior lateral stripe is as in Z. I. lateralis, but the belly is dark and there 
is a yellow stripe on the adjacent edges of the gastrosteges and first 
row of scales. The head is unicolor and not spotted, as in the Z. I. later- 
alis. The yellow temporal spot of both forms of the Z. lateralis is to 
be noted as always absent from the allied species. The Z. semilinatus 
agrees with the lateralis in the possession of seventeen rows of scales, 
and the young is more fully striped than the adult. It may be dis- 
tinguished at all ages by the arrangement of the lateral stripes and. 
the uniform coloration of the head. The yellow stripe is, like that of 
the Z. lateralis, on the third and fourth rows only, but the dark band 
below it only occupies the adjacent parts of the second and third rows, 
instead of extending to the gastrosteges. There is a yellow band on 
the adjacent parts of the first and second rows which is absent in the 
Z. lateralis, and there is a dark stripe on the adjacent part of the first 
row and the gastrosteges, where the inferior yellow stripe is i^resent in 
tlie Z.schottii. The belly is light, and not dark, as in the last-mentioned 
species.

Bascanium laierale Hallowell, Cope, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XII, 1889, p. 147. 

Scales in seventeen longitudinal rows; superior labials eight, the 
fourth and fifth entering the orbit. Muzzle depressed, narrow, and 
rather prominent. Frontal plate much narrowed posteriorly, its width 
equal one-half that of a superciliary plate. Seventh and eighth supe- 
rior labials about equal, of rather wide parallelogrammic form. Tempo- 
rals, 2-2-2; the last superior large, subquadrate, their posterior borders 
continuous with that of the parietals. Gastrosteges strongly angu- 
lated; tail entering 3.58 times in total length. Scuta, scutellse, and 
dimensions : 

Cat. No. 15135; gastrosteges, 201 ; ? total length, 815 mm. ; tail injured. 

Cat. No. 15736 ; gastrosteges, 205 ; urosteges, 108 ; total length, 665 mm. ; tail, 253 mm. 

Color above blackish brown, anteriorly becoming lighter posteriorly 
to the end of the tail. The dark color extends on each end of the 
gastrosteges to the angulation, 
thiougliout the length, and in the 
younger specimen appeared as a 
row of spots on either side of the 
middle part of the gastrosteges, 
failing out beyond the middle of 
the length. In the larger speci- 
men the dark brown predomi- 
nates on the inferior surfaces, 
yielding gradually to the ground 
color, which predominates on 
the inferior surface of the tail. 
Ground color of bellj^ yellow. A 
yellow spot on the preocular, and 
in the younger specimen, on the 
postoculars and labial plates. 
Gular and geneial i)lates yellow-sjmtted in the younger specimen, 
nearly uniform dark brown in the older. On the anterior part of the 
body of the younger specimen the lateral scales to the third and fourth 
rows have brown shades, with an obscure trace of cross-banding. On 
the same siDecimen, near the middle of the body, there are two pale 
semicross bands near together. In the same the center of each parie- 
tal plate is brown. 

This subspecies differs widely from the typical form in color characters.

ZAMENIS AURIGULUS Cope. 

Bascanium aurigulum Cope, Check-list N. Amer. Batr. Rept. N., 1875, p. 40. 
Drymobius aurigulua Cope, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1861, p. 301. 

Scales in seventeen rows, those of the median series very elongate. 
Crown and muzzle very plane, supercilium and canthus rostralis promi- 
nent; eye moderate, muzzle 
more elongate than in any 
other species of the genus. 
Eostral plate rounded, 
slightly prominent, recurved 
above. Frontal elongate, 
posteriorly half as wide as 
each superciliary, not in con- 
tact with i)reocular. Parie- 
tals elongate, posteriorly 
truncate. Nasals and loreals 
very long, the latter en- 
croaching much on preocu- 
lar. Three preoculars, two 
postoculars. Superior labi- 
als eight, fourth and fifth entering orbit; the eighth equal in elevation 
and length to the penultimate; both much longer than high. Inferior 
labials ten, fifth largest; postgeneials longer than pregeneials. 

Color above brown, becoming nearly black anteriorly. Cephalic 
plates light brown, shaded with yellow. A narrow yellow band passes 
round the muzzle from eye to eye. A spot on the temporal region, one 
on the postoculars; all the labials, the chin, and anterior part of the 
abdomen bright golden and unspotted, as are also the sides of the neck 
and anterior fourth of body to the fifth row of scales. On the second 
and third rows of scales of the latter region is a black band regularly 
interrupted at intervals of about seven scales, which bounds a yellow 
lateral stripe above it where present. It finally becomes continuous, 
and with a band upon the first row almost excludes the yellow ground 
color upon the i)osterior and middle parts of the body. Abdomen dirty 
yellowish, unspotted. 

Proportions slender, but the specimen does not include the posterior 
half of the length. This curiously marked species mostly resembles 
the Z. lateralis. The lateral stripe is confined to the third and fourth 
rows opposite the lateral black stripe, but at the interruptions extend

to the fifth. The muzzle is more elou^ate, hence also the nasal and 
loreal plates and the penultimate and ultimate superior labials are 
longer. The tendency of the coloration is to produce two series of 
alternating yellow and black spots along the anterior part of the length. 
The narrower form of the posterior superior labials distinguishes the 
type from most individuals of the Z. lateralis lateralis, but in a specimen 
of the latter from Baird, California, these scales approximate nearly 
the form in the present subspecies. 

According to Mr. Van Denburgh this species is quite rare, the 
explorations of the California Academy of Sciences having brought to 
light only one other specimen.

ZAMENIS SCHOTTII Baird and Girard. 

Maaticophis schottii Baird and Girard, Cat. N. Amer. Rept., Pt. 1, Serpents, 1853, 
p. 160.— Baird, U. S. Mex. Bound. Surv., II, Reptiles, 1859, p. 20, pi. xviii. 

Head elongate, narrow, the muzzle projecting but not decurved. 
Inferior labials eight; temporals 2-2-2. Frontal narrow posteriorly, 
but not so much so as in 
Z. lateralis, being about 
three-fourths the diam- 
eter of the supercili- 
aries at the same point. 
Scales in fifteen rows. 
Tail long, entering the 
total length three and a 
half times. 

The general tint above 
is a dark greenish olive. 
On each side are two 
well-defined narrow yel- 
lowish-white lines; the 
first along the junction 
of the outer dorsal row and the abdominal scutelLne, involving only the 
adjacent angles; the second similiarly constituted in relation to the 
third and fourth rows (not running tlnongh the centers of the scales). 
The portion of the third and fourth rows not involved by the upper 
white line is black, as is also a narrow margin above the lower white 
line, of the same diameter with it. The upper angles of the scales in 
the first row, and the whole of those of the second row, are of a lighter 
olive than the back. All the scales on the back between the upper

yellow lines of the opposite sides are margined with yellow along their 
basal edges, only evident on separating the scales. Anteriorly is a 
short yellow line along the junction of the second and third rows of 
scales, extending to about the twenty-fifth abdominal scutella. 

Color beneath, with the greater part of the scutelhie, closely and 
minutely blotched with greenish slate. Anteriorly a shade of yellow 
appears, and near the head the blotching is in two series, as in the rest 
of the genus. The tail also is nearly unspotted yellowish, except ante- 
riorly. On the external fourth of the abdominal scutelhe the blotching 
is more confluent, forming a well-defined margin to the lower yellow 
line. Anteriorly the side of the abdomen is of a dull red. The upper 
jaw is yellowish white, excepting the lower edges along the first to the 
sixth labials, which are black. Orbitals, loreal, and nasals with a yel- 
low central spot. 

The lateral stripes become obsolete at about three- fiftlis of the length 
from the head, so that the body posteriorly is nearly unicolor above. 
Upper labials yellow, unspotted, but margined below (except the last 
two) with black, and margined above with greenish slate posterior to 
the orbit, and brown anterior to it. The nasals, loreal, and preocular 
have yellow median spot each, but the temporal region and top of head 
are a uniform greenish slate. 

Baird and Girard give the following scutal formula, and measure- 
ments in inches: 

Eagle Pass, Texas ; gastroteges, 201+1 ; urosteges, 138 ; total length, 54i ; tail, 17f . 

But two adult specimens referable to this species are known, and 
they agree in every respect, and differ in coloration and the form of the 
frontal plate from eight specimens of the Z. lateralis, which species they 
most nearly resemble. The latter all possess also seventeen rows of 
scales, while the Z. schottii possesses fifteen. Some young specimens, 
however, are in some resi)ects intermediate. So far as regards the form 
of the frontal plate their characters may be those of immaturity. Thus 
Cat. No. 1 1423 has in all respects the coloration of the Z. lateralis, but 
has only fifteen rows of scales. Cat. No. 1982 has a trace of the inferior 
lateral stripe of the Z. schottii, but the space between it and the 
superior lateral stripe is lined, and the head and labial plates are 
spotted, both characters of the Z. tamiatus. Cat. No. 1974 has a trace 
of the inferior stripe on the middle third of the length, while the 
superior stripe extends on the anterior two-thirds. The coloration of 
the head is exactly that of the Z. schottii. It may indicate a sub- 
species of this species.

sides, beneath mottled; a yellow stripe on each side of the abdomen, 
and two pairs of short yellow stripes, one behind the other, on the 
anterior i)art of the body, and' in the fourth dorsal rows. Tail about 
one-third the total length. 

The head is narrow, much elongated, and rather depressed, being 
considerably less arched than in Z. flagellum. The vertical is very 
much elongated, a little shorter than the occipital. The muzzle is 
rather broad anteriorly, owing to the greater than usual development

of the anterior frontals. The center of the eye is considerably in 
advance of the commissural line, aud behind the junction of the fourth 
and fifth labial. The upper anteorbital is very large, the lower still 
smaller than in the other species; in one specimen it is wanting. The 
sixth labial scarcely touches the postorbital, in one specimen being 
separated by a small plate. The loreal is elongated, lower than in Z. 
flagelbon. Labials, eight above, penultimate largest; nine or ten below, 
the fifth largest. Eostral broader than high, the reverse being the 
case in Z. flagellum. Dorsal rows of scales, fifteen. The scales are 
broad, very large, thin, and perfectly smooth. The edges are nearly 
straight, tip truncated aud rounded off. They are decidedly broader 
than in Z. flagellum. 

General color above dark purple, becoming almost black toward the 
back, brighter on the sides; the colors are deeper toward the head;

skin between the scales dark, beneath yellowish, blotched with black; 
anteriorly the blotches are in the form of two quite contiguous rows of 
broad, mottled spots, which become broken posteriorly, and overspread 
the abdomen; anteriorly these are dark brown, posteriorly they are 
lighter and tinged with red; the tail is immaculate, reddish white. A 
narrow yellow line along the contiguous edges of the abdomen and 
outer dorsal rows. The fourth row of scales with the adjacent edges 
of the third and fifth, are yellowish white, with a well-defined black 
line through the center of the former. Down the center of all the 
rows as well as the fourth, is a black line, most intense on the first and 
third rows. At successive intervals along the back are seen broad, 
transverse light bands, produced by the obliteration of the black line 
in the fourth row, and by all the doi^sal scales between the light lines 
being yellowish white, with more or less of purplish black toward the 
tips. There are about eight of these'dorsal marks on the anterior 
three-fifths of the body, the first being indicated by a light bar on the 
nape.

and Girard, the latter in inches:

The above specimens are adult. The relative lengths of the tail in 
two of them are: Cat. No. 1970, two and twelve- thirteenths in total 
length; Cat, No. 1971, two and nine-tenths in total length. 

They differ in coloration only in the degree of paleness of the longi- 
tudinal stripes and cross-shades, the colors being less contrasted in 
some than in others. 

Although this species has the scale formula, and some resemblance 
in coloration to the Z. twniatus, I can not now refer it to that species. 
The head is elongate, with narrow protuberant muzzle more like the Z. 
fiagellum and Z. piceus than the Z. tcvniatus and Z. lateralis. Tbe 
Z. ornatus displays the unusual peculiarity of a striped species with a 
tendency to become annulate.

Form very slender ; head distinct. Muzzle not elongate nor decurved, 
somewhat flattened; the apex slightly protruding. Eye rather large. 
Tail a little less than 
one-third the total 
length. Eostral plate 
slightly recurved on 
the summit of the muz- 
zle. Internasals wider 
than long. Frontal at 
the narrowest part 
equals one half the 
width of the supercili- 
ary. Parietals openly 
emarginate, truncate 
behind. Loreal longer 
than high ; postoculars 
two; temj)orals 2-2-2. 

Superior labials eight, the fourth and fifth bounding the orbit below ; 
the sixth snbtriangular, the apex sometimes reaching the inferior pre- 
ocular; the seventh largest. Inferior labials nine, the fifth the largest. 
Postgeneials a little larger than pregeneials. Scales in fifteen longi- 
tudinal rows, those on the anterior two-thirds of the body elongate, 
those following, wider. 

Baird and Girard give the following scutal formuljB and measure- 
ments, the latter in inches: 

California; gastrosteges, 209 -{- 1 ; urosteges, 157; total length, 108; tail, 14. 

I add the following, measurements in millimeters: 

Provo, Utah; gastrosteges, 207 + 1 ; urosteges, 138; total length, 1100 ; tail, 337. 

A longitudinal dorsal band, six and two half-scales wide, olive-brown, 
each scale with a rather deeper spot in the center; the four and a half 
scales on each side of this band yellow, each row with a narrow brown 
stripe through its center, fading out in the tail. There are thus five 
(lark stripes on each side, the fifth above margining the dorsal band. 
Of these stripes, the first and third are narrow, each showing a stripe 
of yellow of the same size on each side of it; the second and third are 
closer to eacli other and broader. Beneath yellowish, with a distinct 
dark stripe on each side, just witliin the external row of dorsal scales. 
The scutellne otherwise immaculated, except a few scattered dots

toward tbe head, exhibiting a tendency to arrangement in two rows. 
Extreme bases of all the scales black. 

The above expresses the condition of specimens of medium age. In 
young examples the head i)lates have pale margins, and this character 
sometimes persists in specimens of considerable size. The dark stripes 
on the extremities of the gastrosteges is absent in half the specimens. 
The lines on the middles of the dorsal scales are sonietimes wanting, so 
that the back is uniform brown. Sometimes the space between the first 
and third rows of scales is darker than that between the latter and the 
middle of the fifth row, thus imitating the 31. laterale, but with the light 
stripe thus outlined one row of scales higher up. 

The lateral jilates from the postoculars forward are yellow with 
brown borders; the temporals are brown with yellow borders, thus dif- 
fering from the M. schottiiy where they are unicolor. The superior 
labials bave their superior and inferior edges brown bordered or rather 
blotched, except the eighth, which has the lower edge yellow. Inferior 
labials and genials marked with black specks or blotches. 

A young specimen (Cat. No. 81123) has the tendency to a yellow stripe 
on the third, fourth, and fifth rows of scales above referred to, well 
marked. The head shields above have narrow pale margins. The 
frontal plate is not so narrow posteriorly as in the adult from the same 
and other localities. Still younger individuals (Cat. Nos. 1982, 11423) 
have the lateral yellow stripe more distinct by the suflusion of the third, 
second, and half the first rows with brown, thus producing an appear- 
ance much like that of the Z. lateralis. But only the third and fourth 
rows have the yellow stripe, and the brown band covers the ends of the 
gastrosteges of that species. It was this resemblauce that induced me 
to combine the two species, with the remark ^ ''the young, of the form 
laieralis, the adult, the twriiatus.^^ 

Measurements. — The measurements of the tail in nine sj)ecimens are 
as follows: Three and one-seventh times in total length, Cat. Nos. 8432 
and 4384; three and one- fifth, Cat. Nos. 9520, 8120, and 11422; three 
and one-fourth. Cat. Nos. 13G18 and 1979; three and one-third, Cat. Nos. 
8122; three and one half, Cat. No. 1983. 

The distribution of this elegant snake is throughout the Sonoran 
region north to Salt Lake and western Colorado, and in the Pacific 
north to Baird, Shasta County. I have met with it in the Eio Grande 
Valley as far south as Laredo, Texas. I observed a specimen strung 
through the branches of a screw-bean thicket. It eyed me for a time, 
l>erfectly protected by the bard spines of the bushes, which prevented 
me from seizing it. On being stirred up it moved off rapidly and grace- 
fully through the branches.

Batr. Rept., 1875, p. 38. 

Form elongate, head distinct from body. Cephalic plates normal, 
except rostral shield, which is expanded laterally with more or less 
free margins, and is recurved on the summit of the muzzle. Two 
nasals. Preocular divided. Scales smooth bifurcate. Anal and sub- 
caudal scutelhe divided. Teeth longer posteriorly. Pupil round. 

This genus is more like the Lytorliynchus of Peters of Africa and the 
adjacent parts of Asia, and like it, inhabits, as to its typical form, the 
8. grahamia', dry and rocky regions. It has the same peculiarly 
expanded rostral plate as the genus Fhyllorhynchus Stejneger, and dis- 
plays a similar tendency to division of the lateral head sliields. Three 
species of Salvadora are known, all of which are found within the 
political limits of Mexico, and one of them {S. (frahamice) occurs also 
in the Sonoran region within tlie United States. 

I proposed' to change the name of this genus, because it had 
been previously given by Linnaeus to a genus of plants. As it is not 
now regarded as necessary to maintain uniform difference between 
plant and animal generic names, 1 have recurred to the name of I^aird 
and Grirard.

produced slightly between the postnasal and the loreal, on the sides of 
the head. Frontal subpentagoual, much elongated, tapering posteriorly 
without being pointed. Parietals elongated, posteriorly truncated, 
sides rounded. Prenasal larger, subtrapezoidal ; postnasal subquad- 
rangnlar; nostril situated at the anteroposterior angle of the postnasal. 
Loreal subtriangular, base in a horizontal line with the head; apex 
upwards produced between the postfrontal and the upper anteorbital. 
Oculars 2-2 or 3-2. Upper anteorbital large, angular, produced to the 
upper surface of the head between the superciliaries and postfroutaLs. 
Inferior anteorbitals small and quadrangular, lowest situated on the 
commissure between the fourth and fifth labials. Postorbitals angular, 
equal in size. Two ijretemporals, shields somewhat larger than rest, 
which are scarcely larger than the scales. Mouth deeply cleft, undu- 
lating. Upper labials eight; seventh largest, the three anterior ones 
comparatively small. Lower labials not conspicuous, ten in number, 
fifth largest, the three posterior ones scarcely to be distinguished from 
the scales. Posterior pair of mental scutellse much smaller than the 
anterior, extending to the middle of the fifth inferior labial. Sym- 
physeal plate very small. 

Body subcylindrical, elongated, tail subconical, tapering, forming 
about the one-fourth of the total length. Scales elliptical, disposed in 
seventeen rows; outer row somewhat broader, the rest slightly dimin- 
ishing towards the dorsal region. 

Surface of head brown. An ochraceous vitta extends from the occiput 
to near the end of the tail, embracing anteriorly three rows of scales, 
and posteriorly one row, and two adjoining halves to opposite the anus; 
on the tail it covers two half scales. On each side of this a brown 
vitta runs parallel, and covers the same number of scales anteriorly 
and posteriorly, except on the tail, where it is narrower, and embraces 
only half a scale. The auterio-inferior margin of the scales in the 
black vitta is yellowish green. The remaining portion of the flanks, 
embracing four rows of scales, and the extremities of the scutelhe, is 
uniform yellowish green, with the bases of the scales blackish, as is 
also the skin. The abdomen is uniform dull yellow. 

Sonora ; gastrostegea, 180 + 1 ; urosteges, 97 ; total length, 28J iuches ; tail, 7i inches. 

Considerable variations are presented by this species. Thus in four 
specimens (Cat. Nos. 4673, 4470, 14004, 17175) a narrow brown band 
extends along the fourth row of scales, in addition to the usual one on 
each side of the median line. In Cat. Nos. 4470, 2082 the superior 
stripe is partially broken into spots. In Cat. No. 9001 the bands are 
obsolete, being represented by blackish shades at the bases of the 
scales. Several specimens (Cat. Nos. 2082, 9101, 5347, 12638, 13811, 
16339) have a small loreal below the usual one. In five (Cat. Xos. 2082, 
4470, 9101, 13811, 16339) a second inferior ocular is formed from the sum- 
mit of the fourth superior labial plate, so that the fifth only enters the 
orbit. On a specimen of this kind was proposed the Phimothyra hexalepis,

wliieh has also wider brown dorsal stripes tliau any other individual. 
In Oat. Nos. 13811, 16339, and 17175 there are nine superior labials. 

The S. hairdi resembles this species considerably, but has the rostral 
phite much narrower, and with more closely appressed edges, quite as 
the S. mexicana. One or more of the temporal scales of the inferior 
row is larger than in the S. grahamue. The colors are darker. The 
S. mexicana is a larger species than either of the others, and its general 
appearance is a mixture of the Zamenis tKniatus and the Z. Jiagelliformis. 
The head is longer and flatter than the other species, and the temporal 
scales are in four vertical rows, the upper row larger. 

The Salvadora grahamkv. ranges from Guyamas, Sonora (Cragin), 
Batopilas, Ohihu;ihua (Wilkinson), and Cape St. Lucas (Xantus), on the 
south, to Cottoiiwootl Canyon, Utah, on the north. The locality given on 
the authority of Yarrow, " Ogden, Utah," in the following list, requires 
confirmation, as it is much further north than it is to be looked for.

PHYLLORHYNCHUS Stejneger. 
Pliyllorhynchus Stejneger, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XIII, 1890, p. 1")!. 

Head slightly distinct, short; tail short; palatine teeth present; 
dentition diacranterian ; rostral plate greatly enlarged, with free lateral 
borders, and produced backward so as to separate the supranasals 
entirely; anal undivided; no scale pits; pupil vertical; two nasals; 
loreal present; supralabials not in contact with orbit; one pair of 
geneials only. 

This genus is a curious example of those snakes in which the rostral 
shows a most extraordinary develoiDment. In the present instance this 
shield resembles a thick leaf loosely attached to the front of the snout 
and turned over on top of the muzzle. It approaches very closely the 
Lytorhynclms Peters of the desert regions of Korth Africa and India, 
differing only in the greater posterior jirolongation of the rostral shield. 
Two species are known, both from the Sonoran region. They differ as 
follows : 

Scales keeled ou posterior two-tbirtls of body ; tail one-eighth of total length ; about 
fifteen dorsal and no lateral spots Ph. hroxnii Stejneger. 

Scales all smooth; tail shorter, about one twelfth the length; about thirty dorsal 
spots and one or two rows of lateral spots Pli. decurtatus Cope.

hundred and fifty-nine; anal entire; urosteges, thirty-one, divided; tail 
about one-eighth of total length; upper surface with about fifteen 
saddle-shaped brownish blotches on back and tail; no lateral spots. 
Rostral very prominent and broad, recurved on the top of the snout so 
as to separate the supranasals entirely and the prefrontals partially, 
with free lateral edges which are rather sharp and thin; lower side of 
rostral deeply concave; two prefrontals; frontal large, hexagonal, as 
broad as long; parietals scarcely longer than frontal, their width equal- 
ing their length ; at their posterior border a broad but very short shield

with a median groove iu continuation of tlie interparietal suture; nos- 
tril large, opening between the two large nasals and overhung by the 
prominent lower edge of the supranasal; the loreal proper high and 
narrow, surmounted by a small supraloreal which joins the supranasal, 
the upper preorbitals, and the prefrontals, being a detached portion of 
the latter; between the loreal proper and the supralabials two small 
subloreals; three preoculars, upper largest and not in contact with the 
frontal; two suboculars; four postoculars; three anterior temporals, 
upper largest; six supralabials, the two posterior largest (on the left 
side a narrow portion of the last is divided off anteriorly by a vertical 
sutnre not shown in the figure), none in contact with orbit; nine infra- 
labials, the first five largest; mental triangular, with two well-defined 
concavities on the anterior border ; only one pair of large, broad geneial 
shields, with a straight anterior border joined in its whole length by 
the posterior border of the first infralabials, the lower border of the 
second infralabial only meeting the lateral border of the geneial; a 
small scale wedged in between the geneial and the fourth and fifth 
infralabials probably represents the second pair of geneials. Scales

nearly equal, in nineteen rows, those on the anterior third of the body 
nearly smooth, but becoming gradually more distinctly keeled posteri- 
orly; gasterosteges, one hundred and fifty-nine; anal entire; urosteges, 
thirty-one pairs. Tail rather blunt. 

Dimensions. — Total length, 325 mm. ; length of tail from anus, 42 mm. ; 
proportion of tail to total length = 1 : 7.75. 

Coloration [in alcohol). — White, with fifteen "seal brown" blotches 
on the back from head to tip of tail, becoming palo posteriorly; the 
first of these blotches, which begins three scale rows behind the parie- 
tals is of a uniform dark color, rather long and nearly hourglass-shaped, 
its anterior border being concave, and the antero-lateral corners pro- 
duced to the angle of the mouth, and nearly meeting the posterior ends 
of a broad line of dark color which runs from the upper posterior labials 
on one side through the eye across the interorbital space down to the 
hinder labials on the other side; the other blotches are more or less 
square with rounded corners, the middle portion being lighter — the 
dark color only "powdered" over the white ground — with dark borders. 
The anterior and i)osterior borders wider than the lateral ones, the

white interspaces faintly "powdered" with brown on the sides; hinder 
supralabials with the i)osterior margin dark brown; lower surface uni- 
form white. 

This species diflfers in many important jjoints from the previously 
described Ph. decurtatus, from Lower California. It is of stouter build, 
with a proportionately longer tail ; the dorsal scales are decidedly keeled 
on the posterior two-thirds of the body, while in Ph. decurtatus they 
are all smooth; the number of gasterosteges is larger and the urosteges 
fewer; in Ph. decurtatus the rostral seems to be thicker, and the shields 
on the sides of the face are fewer; finally, the coloration is very differ- 
ent, Ph. hrownl having only fifteen dorsal blotches and no lateral spots, 
against double the number of dorsal blotches and very j)ronounced 
lateral spots in Ph. decurtatus.

one hundred and seventy-seven; anal entire; urosteges twentj'^-six 
pairs. 

Dimensions. — Total length, 350 mm. ; length of tail from anus, 29 mm. ; 
proportion of tail to total length=l: 12. 

Coloration {in alcohol). — Ground color whitish, with about thirty-two 
" chocolate brown " blotches on the back from neck to tip of tail ; shape 
and size more or less irregular, but usually more or less concave iu front 
and behind, pale in the middle, the brown color being merely sprinkled 
over the white ground; on the sides a row of smaller brown spots, two 
or three scales large, in a more or less double series, and, as a rule, alter- 
nating with the dorsal blotches; on the head a broad line from above 
each angle of the mouth running upward and forward through the eyes 
and meeting on the prefrontals; a few irregular spots on posterior por- 
tion of frontal, on parietals and anterior portion of neck, as well as on 
some of the supralabials; lower surface unspotted. 

The above description is derived from the typical specimen, which 
was brought from the northern part of Lower California by INIr. William 
M. (xabb, and is preserved in the museum of the Academy of J^atural 
Sciences of Philadelphia. 

Another specimen is in the United States National Museum (Cat. 
No. 12639), and was collected by Mr. L. Belding at La Paz, near the 
southern extremity of the peninsula. According to Stejneger this spe- 
cimen agrees with the type in all essential points. The scutellation is 
identical with the right side of the type (one subloreal only), except 
that there are three anterior temporals, lower largest; gastrosteges one 
hundred and seventy-two; urosteges twenty-seven pairs. 

Dimensions. — Total length, 300 mm.; tail from anus, 28 mm.; propor- 
tion of tail to total length = 1 : 10.7. 

The coloration is also quite similar, the number of dorsal blotches 
being twenty-nine.

Colubrid suakes with equal teeth, subcyliudric body, and two rows 
of caudal scutelhe. The pupil round; the rostral and nine suijerior 
cephalic shields normal; two nasals and one preocular plates. Two 
pairs of geneials; scales of the body with two apical pits, keeled or 
rarely, smooth. Preanal sbield divided. 

This genus embraces a number of species of the northern temperate 
regions of the world. Six species belong to Eurasia and ten to North 
America. Three others extend to within the tropics of Mexico and 
Central America. 

The proper application of the Linnaean generic name Coluber only 
ai)pears after considerable criticism of the work of the earlier writers 
on reptiles. The first author to use the name after Linnseus was Lau- 
renti, in 17G8, in his Specimen Synopsis Eeptilium, published at Vienna. 
He includes in it ten species, of which eight can be determined. Of 
these, three are Viperida?, one is a crotalid, and four are harmless snakes. 
All of the venomous and three of the harmless species bear Linnjiean 
names, and all of them are members of the Linnfean genus Coluber. It 
remains to be determined for which of these types the name Coluber of 
Laurenti must be retained. The evidence is furnished by the author in 
the following foot-note attached to the generic character: 

Colubri venenati absque iilla injuria accepta ferocissime irruunt in hominem. 

In the opinion of Laurenti the Colubri were poisonous, and this was 
probably due to the fact that the only species of his list with which he 
was acquainted by actual observation were the European vipers he in- 
cluded in it. The poisonous species are then the types of the Coluber 
of Laurenti. 

The next author to use the name Coluber was Treviranus.' He indi- 
cated but one species, C. nafri.v. As this species is the type of the 
Nntrix of Laurenti of 1798, it can not be used in that connection. 

Oppel, in his work on Ee])tilia published in 1811, gave the following 
species under the genus Coluber: 

C. melanocejihala Linna-us. C. natrix Linnreus. 

C. cursor. C. mycierizans Liuna'us. 

C. (vsculapii Gmolin, Linntuus, 1788. C. ihiboea. 

C. caniis Linnaius. C. cyaueits Linnteus. 

C. rijyeriniis Linna'us. C. carinatus Linnaus. 



Biologic ad Philosophie d. Natur, Giittingen, 1802. 



826 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Of these species tlie C. cursor and G. ihiboca are not Liunsean, and the 
C. viperinus and G. natrix belong to a genus which had been already 
established, the Natrix of Laureuti. We are therefore restricted to six 
species in our search for the type of the genus Goluber. They received 
generic names at tlie following dates: 

C. melanocepliala; Tantilla Baird and Girard, 1853. 

C. a'sculapu; Coluber Giiuther, 1858. 

C. canus; Pseiidaspis Cope, 1864. 

C. mycterizans; Passerita Gray, 1825. 

C. cyaneus; uuidentified. 

C. carmatus; Herpetudryas Boie, 1826. 

Giinther in 1858 selected the G. cesculapii as the type of Goluher, and 
to this species that generic name must be applied. 

Mr. Garman, of Cambridge, has followed Dumeril in using the name 
Goluber for the G. constrictor Linnaeus. The way in which this conclu- 
sion has been reached is as follows : 

The first author whom we have to consider is Fitzinger, whose Neue 
Classification der Eeptilieu appeared in June, 1826, in Vienna. Sev- 
enty-one species of Goluber are enumerated in this work (page 57), of 
which only twenty-two are of Linnsean origin, and to these we must 
therefore confine our attention. In the following list of them the names 
of the genera to which these species were successively referred is given, 
and the date of each : 

C. minervw (unidentified). 

C. typlilus, Opheomorplius Cope, 1862; Xenodon Boie and Schlegel, 1837. 

C. cyaneus Linnaeus (unidentified). 

C. constrictor, Bascanium Baird and Girard, 1853. 

C. saturninus. Herpetodryas Boie, 1826. 

C. reginw, Liophis Wagler, 1830. 

C. milinris (unidentified). 

C. cohella, Opheomorplius Cope, 1862 ; Liophis Wagler, 1830. 

C. rhombeaius, Psarnmophylax Wagler, 1830. 

C. domesticus, the same as 

C. hippocrepis, Zamenis AVagler, 1830. 

C. lineatus, Lygophis Cope, 1862; Bromicus Bibron, 1853. 

C. pethola, Oxyrrhopus Wagler, 1830. 

C. vittatus, Tropidonotns Kuhl, 1826. 

C. cestivus, Herpetodryas Wagler; Dumdril and Bibron, 1853. 

C. scaher, Dasypeltis Wagler, 1830. 

C. ordinatus, Eutwnia Baird and Girard, 1853; Tropidonotns Kuhl, 1826. 

C. siriatulus, Haldea Baird and Girard, 1853. 

C. natrix, Tropidonotus Kuhl, 1826. 

C. stolatus, Amplnesma Dumeril, 1853; Tropidonotns Kuhl, 1826. 

C, sauriia, Eutamia Baird and Girard, 1853; Tropidonotus Kuhl, 1826. 

C. fasciatus, Tropidonotus Kuhl, 1826. 

The latest date only can be considered in this connection, since the 
names of genera are retained in accordance with the priority of date 
of each. The latest date at which species of this restricted division 
Goluber are referred to other genera is 1853. In that year four of them 



CKOCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 827 

were referred to genera distinct from Coluber, and of these genera three 
were newly established. These three are Bascanium Baird and Girard, 
Dromicus Bibron, and Haldea Baird and Girard. Now Dumeril, who 
published tlie prodromons of his classification of the serpents in 1853, 
expressly retains the name Coluber for the C. constrictor of Linnceus, 
type of Bascanium. But as the C. constrictor is not included in the 
Oppelian genus Coluber of 1811, it can not be considered here at all. 

Shortly after the appearance of the work of Fitzinger, Boie furnished 
a synopsis of his systematic work on reptiles.^ He gives a list of 
thirty-five species of the genus (7oZ?*6er, of which only six are Linniean. 
Of these but three apj)ear in the list from Fitzinger, given above. 
These are G. cyaneus, G. hippocrepis, and G. constrictor, thus restricting 
the n;ime to the G. constrictor. 

Soon after, however, Boie gave a list of the genera of snakes, with a 
typical species for each.^ Here he cites the C. elaphis {Elaphisquater- 
radiatus Gmelin, Dumeril and Bibron) of Europe as the type, and adds 
"u. V. a," meaning, tind viel a^idere — species belonging to the genus. 
What these other species are may be derived from a j)erusal of a pre- 
vious paper by Boie,^ where he describes three closely allied species 
from Japan, the whole belonging to the genus Elaphis of Dumeril and 
Bibron, and one of them [Coluber conspicillatus) being a member of the 
genus Coluber of Giinther. Dr. Giinther has regarded this reference 
as an indication of the meaning of Boie in his use of the name Coluber, 
and this determination must stand on the ground of previous determi- 
nation by Oppel. 

The North American species are of inoffensive habits, but are 
destructive to birds and mammals. Some of them reach considerable 
dimensions, but they are exceeded in this respect by some of the species 
of the allied genus Spilotes. The C. guttatus and G. rosaceus are of 
brilliant colors. 

The Xorth American species are closely allied, and form gradations 
of characters which must be carefully estimated in order to learn the 
definitions. It is not difiicult to distinguish the C. vulpinus, C. guttatus, 
and C. emoryi, but the group of which the C. spiloides is the type is 
more difiicult to unravel. It embraces that species, G. confinis, C. quad- 
rivittatus, G. obsoletus, C.frcnatus, and C. Icetus. All the North Ameri- 
can species (except i)ossibly C. confinis, of which but one specimen is 
known) have twenty-seven rows of scales, some species (0. vuljnnus) 
varying to twenty-five, and others (C emoryi) varying to twenty-nine. 
The most important characters are the number of rows of scales which 
are keeled, and the length of the tail, as indicated by the number of 
urosteges. The coloration has a typical value, but displays many 
transitions, especially in the spiloides group.

C. triaspis Cope.'' 

As regards the characters above enumerated, I will remark that in 
a single specimen of the C. spiloidis there is a rudimeutal third temi)o- 
ral in the first row on each side, one of which is intercalated between 
the two postoculars. In some specimens of G. guttatus there are uo

keels on any of tlie dorsal series of scales, and in one of C. emoryi a 
few dorsal rows have faint traces of keels. In a specimen of G. ohso- 
h'tus (Cat. No. 5503) there are but sixty urosteges, the smallest number 
known in any other individual being seventy-four. This is abnormal. 
The young of the C. quadririttatus are strongly spotted, and closely 
resemble the G. spilokJcs, as is also the case with the young of the G. 
guttatuH. In the young of ' 0. emory/ there are seldom more than two 
scuta in the first row of temporals, the division into three being accom- 
plished at a later stage 
of growth. The general 
result of these facts is 
that the G. spiloides is 
the primitive type from 
which the other species 
have been derived, some 
by one modification, 
some by another. 

Giinther retained the 
Linna^an name Goluher 
for this genus, as he 
was compelled to do in 
view of the use of it by 
his predecessors Boie g 

and Fleming. ? §

of 1-2-3 scales on one side, and 12, 3-3 on the other. The first is a 
wide plate and different in form from what is found in the other species 
liere described. Last superior labial large, nearly as high as the seventh, 
and little less elevated than the sixth. Postgeueials smaller than pre- 
geneials. Scales in twenty-five rows, rather wide, the first row wider 
than the others^ eleven median rows keeled, mostly quite distinctly. 

Ground color (in alcohol) light yellowish, crossed above by thirty sub- 
quadrate brown spots, which have in some places very slight traces of 
a black border anteriorly and posteriorly. The spots are wider than 
long, except the anterior four spots, which are longer than wide. There 
is a series of rounded brown spots on the sides alternating with these, 
of which the anterior form are longer than deep, the first forming a 
short band. A very obscure series of spots on the ends of the gastro- 
steges alternates with the lateral spots. Toward the posterior part of 
the belly these become confluent, forming a dusky band on the upturned 
extremities of the gastrosteges, as in the C. ohsoletus, and they form two 
parallel bands on the under side of the tail, a character more or less 
visible in other species. The nuchal dorsal spot sends anteriorly and 
posteriorly from its angles short bands, the anterior not reaching the 
parietal plate. There are no markings on any part of the head, which 
is of a uniform yellowish gray above, and cream color below and on the 
superior borders of the mouth. 

When the skin of the upper surfaces is stretched, the dark color of 
the spots is seen not to cover the entire surface of each scale, forming 
longitudinal stripes, which are distinctly indicated in the spaces 
between the spots. 

Cat. No. 762; gastrosteges, 243-fl ; uro8tege8,(?) ; scales, 25; total length, 1114 mm. ;

This species resembles in color characters the C. spiloides, but is in 
its scutellation different from any other American species. The con- 
tracted muzzle with small rostral plate, and the very small loreal, 
together with the large temporals, are especial characters. 

It is not absolutely certain that this is the C. confinis of Baird and 
Girard, the type specimen of which I have not been able to find. The 
description of those authors agrees with it in the number of rows of 
scales, and does not differ in any imi)ortant respect from it. It was 
taken at Anderson, South Carolina.

letely carinated, then more so toward the back, although everywhere 
moderately so. Gastrosteges and urosteges less numerous than in the 
other American species. 

Ground color above light-brown. A series of broad transverse quad- 
rate chocolate blotches extending from head to tail, about sixty in num- 
ber, forty-four to anus. The first spot anteriorly is divided into two on 
the nape, and occasionally the blotches anteriorly are irregular, oblique, 
and varying in size. This occurs, however, only on the anterior fifth 
of the body, behind which the intervals between the blotches are recti- 
linear, nearly equal, and about one and a half scales in length. The 
blotches are generally embraced between the fifth or sixth rows on 
each side, and are three to four scales long. The sides of the blotches 
are not linear, but obtuse-angled. On each side is a series of smaller 
rounded blotches on the 3d to 7th rows similar in color to those on the 
back, and like them with a black border, sometimes more or less inter- 
rupted. Another series of subquadrate black blotches, about the same

size as the last, is visible ou the edge of the abdomen, sometimes iuvolv- 
ing the first aud second rows of scales; these are opposite to the dorsal 
blotches. Rest of the abdomen yellowish- white, with alternating quad 
rate blotches of black. The brown color becomes lighter on the sides. 

A second much larger specimen from Michigan has the ground color 
a yellowish-brown, and there is a black streak from the eye to the angle 
of the mouth; a second vertical stripe under the eye. The spots on 
the back are only about forty-five, of which thirteen belong to the tail. 

This is the most robust species of the genus, and it reaches as large 
a size as any. Every character is consistent. The head is short, the 
parietal plates are short, the body is short, the tail is short, and the 
spots are short relatively to the other species of the genus.

Prof. O. P. Hay^ writes of this species as follows: 

The fox snake appears to be moderately common in some localities. It is often 
kuowu as the " pilot snake," and is supposed to have some mysterious connection 
with the rattlesnake. It is a wholly innocent snake, although it seems a little 
inclined to be pugnacious. Dr. Suckley - states that one of these snakes was brought 
to him alive at Fort Snelling, Minnesota. When provoked it showed its irritation 
by vibrating the tip of its slender tail, which, when striking a crumpled leaf or any 
other small object, would produce a well-marked rattling noise, very similar to that 
made by the rattlesnake under the same circumstances. Other observers make 
mention of the same habit. 

Mr. Robert Ridgway, of the Smithsonian Institution, writes me that, while hunt- 
ing near Mount Carmel, Illinois, he came upon a fox snake over six feet in length. 
It immediately showed a disposition to fight, and Mr. Ridgway says it was the most

viciously disposed snake that he had ever seen. An examination of the stomach 
showed that it had just swallowed a half-growu rabbit. Its disposition appears to 
be in strong contrast to that of C. ohsoletus, which, so far as I have been able to learn, 
is very gentle. 

These snakes, being wholly harmless and subsisting on vermin of various kinds, 
ought to receive the protection of the fanner.

Two plates in the first row of temporals; parietal plate louger than 
mnzzle measured from front of frontal plate. Scales in twenty-seven or 
twenty-nine rows, only five rows of scales, and these weakly. Eight 
superior labials, fourth and fifth entering orbit. Orbitals 1-2. Tail 
short, the scutelhie not exceeding seventy-one in number; gastrosteges 
215 to 235. 

Light reddish-brown, with angular brick-red spots above. Head 
with brick-red bands arranged en chevron, the angle anterior, with 
blackish borders. Below white, tessellated with black. 

This handsome species is represented by two well-marked subspecies, 
which differ as follows : 

Scales in 27 rows; head bands present; dorsal spots narrower, extending over ten to 
fifteen rows, and with one or two rows of lateral spots on each side. . C. g. guitatu^i. 

Scales in 29 rows; head bands, excepting the postocular, wanting or rudimental; 
dorsal spots wider, covering 19-21 rows of scales: no lateral spots C. g. sellatus. 

This species ranges the Austroriparian region east of the Mississippi 
Eiver, and the Carolinian district of the Eastern, not, however, entering 
New Jersey. The subspecies C. (/. sellatus is restricted to Florida. It 
is one of our most brilliantly colored species, and is of inoffensive man- 
ners. It is altogether terrestrial in its habits.

each other. Parietals rather narrow, longer than muzzle from frontal. 
Eye moderate; center rather in advance of junction of fourth and fifth 
labials; orbit above the whole of these labials. Labials eight above, 
penultimate the largest; eleven below. 

Body elongated, little compressed. Tail shorter than in any species, 
except C. vuJpinus. Carination very obsolete, visible only on the five 
central rows, and there very indistinctly; not evident on the tail. 
Scales rather large, triangular, ijointed, the exterior row little if any 
larger than the rest. 

General color of body above light red, paler on the sides. Along the 
back a series of dorsal blotches, about forty-five in number, thirty-two 
from head to anus. These blotches anteriorly are longitudinally quad- 
rate, gradually becoming transverse; in front they are concave before 
and behind, and with the corners produced longitudinally; exteriorly 
they are zigzag convex. The color of each blotch is a dark brick-red,

with a deep black margin half a scale wide. Exterior to the black is 
a lighter shade of the ground color. On each side of the dorsal series 
is a second alternating one of smaller elongated blotches, similarly 
constituted as to color. A third opposite to the dorsal occurs on the 
edge of the abdomen, and on the first to the fourth row of scales; in 
this the red is lightei-, and the black is confined to a few scattered 
scales. The lateral blotches are more or less indistinct in places, and 
frequently confluent with each other and the dorsal series. Posteriorly, 
too, they are reduced more or less to the black marks in single scales. 
Color beneath yellowish white, with subquadrangular blotches of black, 
generally occupying half of the inferior surface of the abdominal 
scutellii'. 

The ground color of the sides extends up on the forehead in the form 
of a frontlet, which crosses the vertical at its anterior extremity, passes 
backward along the top of the head, including the superciliaries and 
outside of occipitals, crosses above the angle of the mouth, and runs 
into the sides of the neck. This is narrowly margined on both edges

with black. A second frontlet across the front of the postfrontals, 
narrower but similar, and bending down on each side to the auteorbital. 
A similarly (;olored blotch on the commissure of the occipitals, widen- 
ing behind and constituting a center to the dark-red space inclosed by 
the large frontlet on the back of the neck; behind the one just men- 
tioned is another rather larger, and the two are sometimes confluent. 
A dark-red stripe is included between the two frontlets just described, 
crossing the posterior part of the postfrontals, the upper end of the 
anterior frontals, and through the eye, across the angle of the mouth 
down the sides of the neck. Vertical edges of the upper and lower 
labials black. 

Specimens from Kemper County, Mississippi, much larger in size, 
agree exactly in the pattern of coloration. The red is, however, more 
or less effaced, probably by the alcohol. The blotches are light hazel, 
and the interspaces light chocolate. 

Smaller specimens from Georgia differ only in having the blotches 
dark hazel, lighter centrally. The intervals are ash gray.

COLUBER GUTTATUS SELLATUS Cope. 



Coluber (/n I tatns sellalns Cope, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XI, 1888, p. 387, 

This subspecies does not differ in any structural character from the 
typical G. guttatus (/tittatus, excepting that the scales are in twenty-nine 
longitudinal rows. The value of this point is uncertain, as but three 
specimens are known. The essential differences are seen in the color. 
The headbands so conspicuous in the C. (j. guttatus are wanting here, 
except the postocular, which is present, and is black-banded above 
and below. The parietal band is indicated by a black external border, 
which extends to the edge of the parietal plate. It is further faintly 
indicated by a shade, which joins that of the opposite side, on the front 
of the frontal scutum. A second character is seen in the absence of 
lateral spots on the body, their places being clear pink or yellowish, like

the ground of the belly. The spaces between the dorsal spots and 
those between the lateral clear spaces are gray dusted. The scales at 
the sui^erior edge of the lateral pale spots are sometimes black-bordered, 
partially outlining a lateral spot. This is most distinct anteriorly, where 
these borders form interrupted longitudinal lines. The dorsal spots are 
red and have narrow serrate black anterior and posterior borders. The 
spots are wider than in the C. g. giittatus, covering nineteen and twenty- 
one longitudinal rows of scales, while in the former they cover but from 
ten to fifteen rows of scales. The belly is tesselated with black spots, 
as in C. g. guttatus, each spot covering the external half of two or three 
gastrosteges. A delicate black line connects them externally, running 
along the angle of the gastrosteges.

allied species, as broad as it is long, with straight anterior border. 
Parietals longer than muzzle from frontal plate. Loreal longer than 
high; preocular not reaching frontal, but separated by the very nar- 
row anterior extremity of the superciliary. Temporals 2-3-4, the pos- 
terior small. Scales of body smooth, rather wide, the first row a little 
wider than the second. Postgeneials smaller than pregeneials, but 
distinct from gular scales. Gastrosteges bent up at the sides. Tail 
probably long as in G. quadrivittatus^ but the end is lost. The uros- 
teges remaining number 47. 

The ground color of the superior surfaces, in the rather fresh alco- 
holic specimen, is buff, each scale with a dusky band within and 
parallel to the border, surrounding a buff' center. This band may be 
broken up into spots. The greater part of the superior surfaces is 
occupied by a series of vermilion-tinted pink spots, which extend 
across the back to within two or three scales of the gastrosteges, thus

covering troiu tweuty-one to tweuty-three scales transversely. Their 
length covers six scales everywhere, though as the scales are more 
elongate anteriorly the spots are also more elongate. The lateral spots 
of other species are represented by pale tracts continuous with the 
light yellow of the belly, which alternate with the dorsal spots, extend- 
ing to an apex on the fourth or fifth row. In other words the cross 
bands of dusky ground-color bifurcate on the flanks, and terminate at 
the extremities of the gastrosteges. Below their termini at the lateral 
angle of the gastrosteges is a short longitudinal black bar or spot 
crossing one or two gastrosteges. This represents the black line which 
occupies a similar position in the C. guttatus. At the anterior and 
posterior parts of the body the dorsal spots have short serrate anterior 
and posterior borders. 

Four indistinct longitudinal bands traverse the length of the body 
on the fourth and fifth and tenth and eleventh rows of scales on each 
side. The inferior band is very obscure, especially anteriorly, and both 
are less distinct on the true skin than on the epidermis. 

The head is of a reddish color above; below, yellowish. A faint 
dusky band extends across the temporal region and parts of the sui)er- 
ciliary and frontal plates, meeting a corresponding one of the opposite 
side. This represents the space between the bands of the C. guttatus, 
which consist in this species of ground color only. Suj)erior and pos- 
terior margins of upper labials obscurely dusky. 

Cat. No. 14418; gastrosteges, 239 + 1 ; urosteges, ( ?) ; scales, 27; total length, 970mm. 

This beautiful species is of considerable interest from the interme- 
diate position it occupies between the C. guttatus and the G. quadrivif- 
tatus. The absence of keels of the scales and the dorsal color spots 
ally it to the former, and especially to the subspecies C. g. sellatus; but 
the absence of lateral and ventral spots and head bands and presence 
of longitudinal stripes ally it to the latter. The width of the frontal 
plate is also (characteristic. It is a very handsome animal.

The dorsal bands extend along the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth rows,

three entire rows of scales and the half of the adjoining rows. The 
abdomen, head, and tail beneath are light straw-color with obscure 
traces of gray spots. On the removal of the epidermis the dark bands 
disappear to a considerable extent, and then indistinct and obsolete

occupying the space between the median ])air of bands. The edges of 
many of the scales are lighter.

An instructive series of the young of this species was sent to the 
U. S. National Museum by William Wittfield from Georgiana, Brevard 
County, Florida. They number nineteen specimens, and show how a 
longitudinally banded snake is developed from a spotted one. The 
specimens may be divided into three lots, the first including Cat. 
Nos. 13650, 13652, 13668, 13669, 13678, 13689, 13696, and 13706. These 
are the smaller sjjecimens, the smallest measuring 325 mm., and the 
largest 380 mm. The dorsal region is marked with brown spots on a 
light ground, and there is a series of smaller spots alternating with 
them on each side, with a trace of a second series of spots alternating 
with the last on the ends of the gastrosteges. The dorsal spots have 
concave anterior and posterior borders, so that the angles of one spot 
approximate those of the adjacent ones. There are forty-two spots 
between the nape and vent. The angles of the nuchal spot are pro- 
duced so as to form short bands, the anterior reaching to near the 
parietal scuta. There is a narrow brown postocular baud, and a nar 
row one across the front on the posterior part of the prefrontal plates. 
The lateral spots of the body are elongate in front, the first forming a 
longitudinal line on the side of the neck. The gastrosteges are spot- 
ted at the ends, and the middle portions are clouded in some of the 
specimens. 

In this stage these specimens are closely similar to the C. spiloides, 
except that the spots in the latter species are less numerous, ranging 
from 30 to 35 on the body. They can not be distinguished by the 
increased number of keeled rows of scales, as the keels are less evident 
in the young than in the adult. 

The second set of specimens measure from 460 to 580 mm., and 
embraces Cat. Xos. 13646, 13657, 13681, 13703. Here the lateral angles 
of the dorsal spots are connected by a faint longitudinal strii^e, thus 
forming the superior pair of stripes of the adult; and the lateral spots 
show a trace of a similar connection on the anterior jjart of the body. 
'Ihe marks on the head are present as in the smaller specimens, or they 
are broken into spots or are nearly absent. The clouded marks of the 
belly are present or absent. 

The third set varies from 580 to 620 mm., and includes Cat. Nos. 
13656, 13670, 13675, 13686, 13691. Here the lateral stripe is fairly dis- 
tinct, and the head and belly are immaculate. Traces of the dorsal 
and lateral spots may be distinctly seen. *

eye, and the edges of the labials in front also black. Some blotching 
on the top of the head, which is too indistinct to define and is sometimes 
entirely wanting. 

Compared with 8. vulpinus the eyes are larger, the parietal plates 
longer, the nostrils more anterior, the carination more obsolete. Body 
more elongated. Abdominal scutell;« more numerous. Spots longitu- 
dinal, not transverse. Scales shorter, broader, more obtusely angular. 

This species is closely allied to ^S*. ffuttatus, but is quite distinct. Its 
full characters can best be seen in larger specimens ; the young are more 
easily confounded with those of *S'. guttatus.

In young specimens of this species (as Cat. Nos. 81)81, 14094) tlie keels 
of the scales are very obscure, or absolutely wanting-, even up to a length 
of430mni.(Cat. No. 14094, Texas). The brown prefrontal and postocular 
bands are also very distinct, but there is no trace of the parietals. With 
increasing age the marks become obscure, or disappear altogether, and 
the abdominal spots become less distinct. Aj^art from the wide head 
and compressed neck and body, the young of the C. spiloides can only 
be distinguished from that of the C. qnaclrivittatus, by the greater 
strength of the colors and the smaller number of the dorsal and lateral 
spots in the former. 

The number of temporal scales varies much in the C. spiloides. 
There are usually three vertical rows, but sometimes there are four, and 
even five. In the latter case a large scale of the labial or parietal 
border covers two rows. 

The habitat of this species is the entire Austroriparian subregiou.

Mr. Morris Gibbs sent me a specimen from Kalamazoo, Michigan, 
which is the most northern locality known. 

Professor Hay ^ thinks that this species is a color form of the C. ohso- 
letus. He bases this conclusion on the spotted coloration of the young 
of the latter, but I do not find this to be a valid argument. The young 
of C. quadriviUatiis are spotted much as in the G. spiloides and some C. 
ohsoletus. The range of the C. spiloides is less extensive than that of 
the C ohsoletus, which includes the Eastern subregion. 

This is the only one of our North American snakes which displays 
the compressed body which is not uncommon in the Colubrine snakes 
of the tropics. This character distinguishes it from the other members 
of the genus found within our limits, but is shared by the C. triaspis 
Cope, of the Central American fauna. This peculiarity implies more 
or less climbing habits, and I suspect that when the C. sjriloides is 
better known it will be found to climb on bushes and low trees.

Two plates in the first row of temporals; eight superior labial plates. 
Parietal plate longer than, or equal to, length of muzzle from front of 
frontal plate. Scales generally in twenty-seven rows, seventeen rows 
keeled; tail long, scutellai not exceeding ninety-two; gastrosteges from 
about two hundred and thirty to two hundred and forty-five. 

Black or brown above, with or without darker subquadrate spots; 
head not banded ; belly very darkly clouded. 

This somewhat variable si^ecies is represented by two subspeciflc 
forms, one of which shows afiflnity to the C. quadrivittatus. They differ 
as follows: 

Spots wheu visible ou the very dark groiiu«l distinct; a row of obscure spots on each 
side of them C. o. obsoletus. 

Ground light brown above, marked bj- square, dark-brown spots, which are con- 
nected at the angles, forming a lougitudinal stripe; no lateral spots, but a 
broad, dark stripe, 4-6 scales wide C. o. lemniscatiis. 

This species ranges throughout the entire Austroriparian region 
from the Eio Grande, and the Eastern, excepting only the Hudsonian 
district. The form C. o. lemniscatus is restricted to the Gulf States, but 
the G. 0. ohsoletus extends as far north as Mount Tom, Massachusetts, 
ou the Connecticut River, according to Dr. J. A. Allen. Dr. Ilolbrook 
records it from the Highlands of the Hudson Eiver, New York. Pro- 
fessor Verrill does not enumerate it among the species taken near 
Norway, Maine. 

This species is not rare in the Middle States. It is, like other mem- 
bers of the genus, of very inoffensive habits, and is useful in reducing 
the numbers of the small Mammalia. It is much less active than the 
Zamenis constrictor, which it resembles in nothing but color. It is 
known as the Mountain Black Snake, or Pilot Snake. 

COLUBER OBSOLETUS OBSOLETUS = Say. 

Parietals moderate, their commissure equal in length to the frontal.

way between the snout and angle of the mouth. Anterior orbital

zoidal, highest auteriorly, nasals moderate. Labials eight above, 
moderate, i)osteiior small, twelve below ; posterior very small, sixth 
and seventh largest. Nine rows of scales between labials and abdom- 
inal scntelhv at the angle of the month. Onter three to seven rows 
smooth, then carinated very obsoletfly, and then more decidedly and 
in increasing degree toward the back. 

Color above black or dark lead color, marked by a dorsal series of 
quadrangular blotches, about thirty- four from head to anus, rather 
acutely emarginate before 
and behind, occupying a 
width equal to about fifteen 
scales. The lozenge- shaped 
intervals between these 
blotches are from two to three 
scales long centrally, dimin- 
ishing and becoming more 
linear posteriorly. On each 
side, and alternating with 
the dorsal series is a second 
alternating one, composed of 
subrectangular elongated 
blotches, and alternating 
again with these is a second 
indistinct series along the 
edge of the abdomen. The 
entire system bf coloration is 
very difficult to define, the 
general appearance being 
that of a blacksnake with 
irregular obsolete mottlings 
of white. The intervals be- 
tween the blotches may be 
indicated as being white, 
with the center and apex of 
each scale lead color, the pro- 
portion of the latter being 
very small on the sides and 
increasing to the dorsal line. 

The scales in the centers of the blotches have the basal half narrowly 
margined with white, as is the case, to some extent, with the lateral 
spots. Beneath greenish-white, with the centers of the scutelhr mottled 
with dark slate-blue, increasing backward. Chin and throat immaculate 
yellowish-white, scales on the sides with a bluish spot on the apex. 

The colors descril)ed are those as preserved in alcohol. The color of 
the animal when alive is, at least in individuals i'rom west of the Mis- 
sissippi and Texas, red in the markings, which are white in spirits.

In the general obsoleteness of the markings the blotches may some- 
times be detected as more or less contiueut between the different series. 

In two other specimens, Cat. Nos. 10578, 10651, the belly is nearly 
uniform yellowish ; the black of the upper parts is replaced by umber- 
brown. The blotches are visible, but very obsoletely.

This species shares with the C. vnlpinns the distinction of reaching a 
larger size than any other member of the genus. 

This species is found over the entire Eastern district of the United 
States, It is gentle in its disposition and sluggish in its movements. 

In the few specimens in which the lateral spots may be discriminated 
they are seen to be of elongate form, with few exceptions (such as Cat. 
No. 2421, Louisiana). In some specimens they are so elongate as to 
form a narrow lateral band for a short distance anteriorly, as in two 
specimens from Wheatland, Indiana (Cat. Nos. 10578, 10651). Such 
forms prepare us for the subspecies G. o. lemniscatus. In the Texan 
specimens, referred to a distinct species under the name of S. Undhei- 
meri, the ground color is lighter, and the spots are distinct and S(|uare, 
and do not form bands on the neck. I can not see that it is more than 
a variety. 

This is the ''pilot .snake"' of the Allegheny mountaineers.

It is of an inoffensive disposition and may be handled with impunity. 
Tlie following" observations concerning" C. obsoletus obsoletus are made 
by Prof. O. P. Hay:' 

Of the Colubers I liave been able to make observations on C. o. obsoletus alone. It 
is likely that others have observed and vrritten on the subject, but I have not met 
with their statements. Dr. G. B. Goode reclvons ^ this species among those which 
are ovoviviparous, but I am inclined to question this. My son, AV. P. Hay, captured 
two of these snakes near Indianapolis while they were in sexual union. This was 
on June 19. The male (Cat. No. 17948, U.S.N.M.), was 5 feet 5 inches long, the 
female (Cat. No. 17949, U.S.N.M.), 6 feet 3 inches. When they were separated, the 
intromittent organs of the male were everted some 3 inches. A dissection shows 
that the hollow portion of the organ extends behind the vent 3 inches, while the 
retractor muscles form a cord which extends back nearly to the tip of the tail. On 
opening the female I find in her sixteen eggs. Of these eggs four lie about in the mid- 
dle of the reptile's body, while the other twelve occupy a much more anterior position, 
the one farthest forward being within 8 inches of the snake's snout, the hindermost 
one only 9 inches farther back. Several of these eggs are lying apparently loose in 
the body cavity. It might be supposed that they had just left the ovary and were 
about to enter the oviduct; but they are surrounded each with a covering nearly as 
thick and tougli as that of the Heterodon. Could these eggs have been in the ovi- 
ducts and then squeezed out into the body cavity during the time of being entwined 
with the male? 

I have had an opportunity of dissecting a recently captured female, the length of 
which was 4 feet 4 inches. The ovaries lie in the region situated about two-thirds 
the distan<e from the head to the vent. Each oviduct ends close to the correspond- 
ing ovary. It seems evident, therefore, that at least some of the eggs of the speci- 
men described above are really lying loose in the body cavity. In the specimen dis- 
sected the ovarian eggs are very immature, none of them exceeding about a quarter 
of an inch in length. It may be of some interest to add that this female had the 
anterior three-fourths of the body ornamented with blotches of a decided red color, 
the red occupying both the surfaces of the scales and the skin between them. The 
blotches were separated by scales, which were x>avtly yellow. Soon after death a 
great part of the red disappeared. The stomach contained eiglit wild mice, six of 
them young.

848 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Dr. Stejneger adds the following note in the same publication:* 

I am able to state that Coluber obsoletua obsoleiiis is oviparous. Mr. Thomas Mar- 
ron, of the National Museum, early in April, 1889, collected a number of snake eggs 
in a hollow stump near the Potomac River. They were opened and fouud to contain 
fully developed young of this species. (Cat. No. 1.5334, U.S.N.M.) 

Prof. O. P. Hay - gives the following further account of the habits of 
this species: 

Coluher obsoletiis spends its time in hiding about hollow logs and in holes about 
standing trees. It often ascends trees in search of birds and their young. Mr. A. W. 
Butler, of Brookville, Indiana, says they are the most destructive to birds of all our 
snakes. Besides birds, they no doubt prey on mice, rats, rabbits, and other small 
animals. The disposition of this serpent is gentle, and it makes little resistance 
when surprised and seized by head and tail. It will open its mouth in an attempt 
to bite, but struggles little. Under such circumstances a Racer would make a lively 
disturbance. One put into a box with a mouse would strike at the latter whenever 
it showed too much familiarity, but it was not harmed. In the stomach of one indi- 
vidual I found a number of young mice ; in another were two old and six young mice. 

This species probably reaches a greater size than any other snake that we have. 
Mr. Robert Ridgway tells me that he killed oue at Mount Carmel, Illinois, which 
he estimated to be over 9 feet long. It made no resistance when attacked, and was 
as easily killed as an ordinary snake 2 or 3 feet long. This species has the habit, 
common to many snakes, of vibrating its tail so as to make a rattling or whirring 
sound. This probably serves to warn the larger animals of its presence so that they 
may avoid it. 

Dr. G. B. Goode includes this snake among those which are said to "swallow" 
their young; that is, when danger threatens they open their mouths in order to 
allow the young to pass down the mother's throat for safety. More observations 
need to be made on this point. 

I have been able to lind in print no observatious on the breeding habits of this 
snake. When and where are the eggs laid? How many of these are there f How 
soon do they hatch? These are a few of the things that many a farmer's boy might 
be able to find out for ns. Two individuals were taken at Fall Creek, Marion County, 
while in sexual union. This was on June 19. The male was 5 feet 3 inches long; 
the female was 6 feet 3 inches. The female contained sixteen eggs. They have a 
thick covering and must be laid before hatching. Professor Blatchley writes' 
that he kept one, 5 feet 7 inches long, for some time in continement. It would on 
being disturbed vibrate its tail in such a way as to make a rattling sound. When 
the room was entered at night with a lamp the snake would hiss with a loud, gurgling 
noise. A large horned owl kept in the same room was attacked by tb.e snake, tightly 
enveloped in its coils, and so badly crushed that it soon died. 

Maximilian ^ has confirmed the popular notion that the snake will eat fowls' eggs. 
One entered his room, climbed to a vessel of eggs, and swallowed a number of 
them. After the eggs had passed down the throat the shells were crushed by a pow- 
erful constriction of the walls of the stomach. 

The relative sluggishness of this snake probably accounts for its 
rarity as conii)ared with the black racer (Z. constrictor) in the more 
settled portions of the United States.

Coluber obsoletua lemniscatus Cope, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 1888, p. 386. 

This subspecies agrees with the C. obsoletus obsoletus in the number 
of its urosteges and the number of rows of scales that are keeled. It 
presents in the typical sj)ecimen the probable anomaly of three tempo- 
rals of the first row, like a specimen of the (J. o. obsoletus from Texas. 
The characters which distinguish this one from the typical form are 
exclusively those of coloration. 

The ground color above is a light brown. This is marked on the body 
by thirty-one nearly square or longitudinally oblong dark brown spots, 
which are, like those of half-grown individuals of the C. ouadrivittatus.

sides are marked by a wide, brown, longitudinal band which extends 
from the neck to the anus over a width of from four to six scales, 
including the first on each side. Belly yellow, tessellated with square, 
black spots, which become confused on the middle of the length, and 
finally blend in a nearly unbroken blackish brown, which extends to

the lateral band and in the dark coloration of the abdomen. Although 
the scale characters of the C. o. lemniscatns are those of the C. obsoletus 
ohsoletns, it might be regarded as a distinct species from it were it not 
for the intermediate characters presented by two other individuals — 
one from Georgia (Oat. No. 8798, TJ.S.N.M.), and one from Mobile, Ala 
bama. In these serjients the longitudinal bands are present, but the 
lateral shows distinct traces of the spots of the ordinary form, which 
are, indeed, separated from each other at the middle of the length, thus 
interrupting the band for a short distance. The postocular band is 
more distinct. Dorsal spots thirty.

This form is intermediate between the C. quadrivittat/ns and the C. 
ohsoletuH. The lateral band is much wider than that of the former spe- 
cies. A specimen was sent me from Mobile, Alabama, by Dr. Joseph 
Corson, United States Army, and it is therefore probably iound iu 
Florida, though it has not yet been actually obtained there. A second 
specimen is in the U. S. National Museum from Whitfield County, in 
northern Georgia. Two other specimens — one from Mobile and one from 
Georgia — show the lateral bands interrupted into spots posteriorly, and 
hence conne(;t with the C. o. spiloides Dum^ril and Bibron (C. o. confinis

Although known to me from but one specimen, this species must be 
regarded as distinct, occupying a position between the C. spiloides and 
the C. emoriji. 

The head is but little distinguished from the body, which is cylindric 
and not compressed. The muzzle is rather narrow, and the rostral 
plate is also rather narrow, and the frontal is a little longer than wide. 
The supraorbitals are abruptly narrowed in front, and the parietals are 
rather small, although longer than the muzzle from the frontal plate. 
The loreal is well developed, and the two postoculars are subequal. 
Temporals 3-4-5, the third row extending from the posterior side of

the last (eighth) superior labial. The sixth aud seventh sui^erior labials 
are of equal elevation, and a little higher than the eighth. Inferior 
labials 14. Postgeneials much smaller than pregeueials. Scales in 
29 rows; the fifteen median rows keeled, most of them distinctly. First 
row a little larger than second. 

The ground color is brown, and it is crossed on the back (in the 
typical specimen) by 29 spots anterior to the vent, which have 
lounded angles and are of a dark brown color, with darker borders, 
and these again with paler borders on the median dorsal region. 
These spots are wider than long except the three or four anterior ones. 
They alternate with large brown spots on the sides, which are elongate 
antero-posteriorly on the anterior part of the body. Each one cor- 
responds to two smaller, very indistinct spots below it on the ends of

the gastrosteges, which are, on the posterior two-thirds of the body, 
confluent into a dusky band. These bands continued on the inferior 
side of the tail. The abdomen is unspotted anteriorly, but near the 
middle has traces of spots on each side, which are soon lost in a gen 
eral cloudiness, bounded by a light streak on each side, at the position 
of the angle of the gastrosteges. 

On each side of the nape is a dusky band which extends forward 
across the external border of the parietal plate, over the entire supra 
orbital plate, and crosses to meet that of the opposite side, involving 
the entire prefrontal ])lates except the anterior border. A similar band 
connects the lateral bands across the posterior part of tlie frontal i)hite. 
No postocular band nor labial borders, but the yellow of the sui)crioi-

This species resembles in general the C. spiloides, but there are 
important differences. Besides the increased number of the tem- 
poral scales the form of the head and body are different; the head 
being less distinct and the body not compressed, and there are more of 
the dorsal scales keeled. The dorsal spots show none of the produced 
angles of the (7. spiloides. The continuation of the nuchal bands over 
the supraorbital shields to the prefrontals is peculiar to this species, 
since in all the other banded species the nuchal bands unite on the 
middle line of the frontal, or parietals, and the prefrontal band is in 
line with the postocular. Here there is no postocular.

I have not been able to find the type of Baird and Girard, which may 
be lost. The specimen above described agrees with it in essential par-

generally pure ash, especially on the sides. Beneath yellowish white, 
with rather indistinct blotches of brownish ash, thickest behind. 

Head grayish ash, with a somewhat curved broad brown vittaon the 
back part of the i)()stfrontals, which, involving the commissure of the 
anteorbital and su])erciliary, passes back through the eye, and, crossing 
the angle of the mouth on the adjacent halves of the ultimate and 
penultimate labials, extends into the blotches on the sides of the ueck. 
A second nearly effaced bar crosses the anterior frontals, leaving an 
ash-colored band half the width of the first-mentioned bar. The ante- 
rior dorsal blotch is replaced by two elongated ones running up on the 
head to the center of the occipitals, parallel with the postocular vitta, 
with an ash-colored stri])e between the two, which extends from the 
superciliary backward on the sides of the neck. As in the other brown

marks, these stripes are margined with black. The adjacent edges of 
the fourth and fifth labials are brown. This is the only species, except 
C. guttattis, in which the postocular vitta crosses the angle of the 
mouth and passes down the side of the neck. There is scarcely any 
indication of elongation in the lateral spots except anteriorly. 

This species differs from G. vuljpinus in the gray color, much larger 
eye, longer head, narrower vertical, etc.; from C. Iwtus in much the 
same points, as well as in having the dorsal spots transverse, not lon- 
gitudinal ; from C. obsoletus in lighter color and absence of white margins 
to the basal ends of the dorsal scales, and from all in the smooth dorsal 
scales.

This is a southwestern species of the Eastern region, not having 
been yet found east of the Mississippi Eiver nor north of Kansas. Its 
range extends at least as far south on the Mexican Plateau as the city 
of Chihuahua, where it has been found abundantly by Mr. Edward 
Wilkinson.

longitudiual bands behind frontal rciiion ; all the markings beconiiug 
obsolete in a general brown color with maturity. 

The head is rather long and narrow. The prefrontals are each longer 
than wide; the frontal is not narrowed; the parietals are truncate 
behind. The suture between the loreal and prefrontal is oblique, run- 
ning i)osteriorly down ward, so that its superior border is only half as long 
as the inferior. The preocular does not reach the frontal. There are, 
as in other Mexican species of the genus, but two postoculars. The eye 
is over the fourth and fifth labial. None of the labials behind the fifth 
is elevated, but the sixth is elongate so as to border the ends of the 
three long temporal scuta. The inferior of these covers the seventh and 
part of the eighth labials and supports above it two others like it, all 
being directed downward and forward. The superior incloses a little 
scale with the superior postocular. Inferior labials, eleven; geneials 
well developed, the posterior smaller and separated by scales. 

In a young specimen 450 mm. in length, where the color markings 
have not become obsolete, there are seventy-six dorsal spots, of which 
fifty-one are between the nape and the vent. These spots are trans- 
versely quadrate, covering eleven scales transversely and two and a 
half scales anteroposteriorly. They are dark brown with light edges 
and paler centers. The interspaces are less than two scales long. The 
lateral spots are opposite the intervals and are in one row; they are 
subround or suboval. There are two brown stripes on the nape which, 
instead of uniting at both ends, as is the case in the G.Jiavirufus, are 
separate posteriorly and diverge anteriorly, extending to above the pos- 
terior part of the orbits. Between them another band occupies the mid- 
dle line, but is more or less broken. A broad brown band convex for- 
ward between the fronts of the orbits. A brown spot behind orbit. 
Below, immaculate. Gastrosteges, two hundred and eighty-two; anal 
double; urosteges, one hundred and nine. 

Measurements. — Total length, 1.090 mm.; tail, 235 mm. 

Slight variations sometimes occur in the (7. mutabilis. One specimen 
has thirty-five rows of scales; another has but tw^o rows of temporals 
on one side; another has nine superior labials on one side. 

Of the Coluber mutahilis I have before me four specimens from Vera 
Paz, from Mr. Hague; one from the plateau of Costa Eica, from Mr. Zele- 
don, and one from the central or elevated part of the State of Oaxaca, 
from Mr. Sumichrast. I have examined a seventh specimen in the col- 
lection of Prof. Alfredo Duges, who took it in the State of Guanajuato. 
Dr. Duges informs me that it has been also found near Leon, so that 
there is no doubt that it belongs to the plateau of Mexi(;o as well as to 
that of Guatemala. According to the same author it occurs also in San 
Luis Potosi and in Guerrero. 

Dr. Boulenger, in the Catalogue of Snakes in the British Museum, 
has confused this species with the triaspis Cope. The difierences 
between the species are enumerated in the analytical table on page 828.

The C. triaspis is a very different snake, having somewhat tlie appear- 
ance of a Trimorphoilon in the form and color pattern of its head. Like 
the third Mexican si^ecies of Coluber, the G.Jiavirufus Cope, it is an 
inliabitant of the Tiorra Calienta.

Teeth of equal lengths. Head plates normal; two nasals, one loreal 
and one j^reocular. Scales in an odd number of rows, bifossate. Anal 
plate entire; subcaudal scuta divided. Pupil round. 

This genus embraces the largest ground snakes of the Neotropical 
realm, together with a number of species of smaller size of the Paleo- 
tiopical. It differs from Coluber in its entire anal plate, resembling in 
this respect Pityophis, Epiglottophis, and Ehinechis. It approaches the 
last named most nearly in characters, but the rostral shield has not 
the production anteriorly and posteriorly seen in that yenus. 

The Asiatic si)ecies have a compressed form of the body which is not 
seen in the American forms. Some of the latter have a roof-shaped 
body with subtriangular section {G. sulphureuni), while in others (8. 
corais) the body is subcylindric. The scales assume a slightly trans- 
verse direction in some of the American species. But one species is 
found in the United States, and this is a Neotropical species which 
ranges from Brazil through Mexico and the Gulf States to the Atlantic 
coast. 

It may be found necessary to separate the American species from 
this genus, as has been done by Boulenger, under the name of Phrynonax 
Cope. I do not at present, however, know of any character which 
requires this. The difference of dentition pointed out by Dr. Boulenger 
isinsigniiicant,ashis definition indicates. Theintegrity of theanal plate 
is a definite character that can always be observed, which is more than 
can be said for the slight differences of dentition referred to. The 
character of the anal plate is not (piite constant in one of the Asiatic 
species [C. virgatum), according to Boulenger.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



Specimens from the Lower Kio Cxraude have a good deal of brown on 
the bases, edges, or tips of the scales, thus approaching the form melan- 
urus. On the other hand, specimens from the sea islands of Georgia 
are everywhere pure black, except some brownish-red shades on the 
throat and chin. Specimens from this locality have in some instances 
but seven superior labials, and I do not know of any which has eight 
on both sides. Two specimens (Cat. Nos. 4457, 4458) have seven on one 
side and eight on the other. The species Spilotes conperii was proposed 
by Dr. Holbrook for this form, but I find no characteristic to sepa- 
rate it from the individuals from the other Gulf States and Texas, 
except the number of labials, and this is, as observed, variable.

Hemipenis colubriform, with numerous calyces. Teeth equal. Scales 
in an unequal number of rows with paired pits; anal plate entire, sub- 
caudals divided. Two prefrontal and two internasal i)lates. A com- 
pressed prominent epiglottis. Pupil round. 

This genus is PityopMs with only two prefrontal i)lates. It includes 
with present information, two species of the Medicolumbian region, 
which differ as follows : 

Head shorter; supraocular plates wide; a median series of large quadrate dorsal 
spots E. pleurostictus Dumeril and Bibron. 

Head longer; (supraorbital plates narrow; longitudinal black stripes, broken pos- 
teriorly and becoming transverse oc-shaped spots E. lineaticollis Cope.

Head distinct, elongate. Rostral plate rounded in profile, much 
elevated: posterior angle right, not reaching postfrontals. The latter, 
three times the size of the prefrontals. Vertical longer than broad, the 
anterior border straight, as long as the occipitals. Five or six small 
temporals on each side. Xasal plates large; loreal longer than high. 
Preoculars one or two, i^ostoeulars three. Superior labials eight or 
nine, liable to irregular subdivision ; fourth and fifth or fourth, fifth, 
and sixth entering the orbit. Twelve inferior labials; postgeneials 
very small. Scales small in twenty-seven rows, the median ten keeled. 
Tail very short. Gastrosteges, 234-244 ; urosteges, 69-72. General color 
of a specimen long preserved in spirits, above light brown; beneath 
paler. The head is without markings. On the anterior part of the 
body, two black bands, two and two halves rows of scales apart, extend 
for four times the length of the head and terminate each in a narrow 
elliptic annulus. The latter are nearly confliuent with the succeeding 
pair of annuli, which are very narrow. These increase in breadth 
posterioriy until near the middle of the body they become confiuent on 
the median line, forming geminate open spots; near the tail they lose 
the geminate form. Their whole number is thirty-six pairs, separate or 
united. Alternating with these is a smaller series of annuli, which 
become elongate anteriorly, and finally become short black lines, parallel 
to, and three scales from the median pair. A few spots on the extremi- 
ties of the gastrosteges or the posterior part of tlie abdomen.

This species was originally described from a specimen iu*the museum 
of the Philadelphia Academy from Jalapa. It therelore inhabits both 
the Austroriental and Austroccidental districts. The hJ. pleurostictus 



862 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

is found in the Austrocential and Austrotcideutal districts, as well as 
in the Chihuahuan of the Sonoran subiegion. The U. lineaUcollis is 
also reported by Giiuther from D urn as, in Guatemala. 

Though this species differs widely in color characters from the E. 
pleiirostictus it resembles it closely structurally. Boulenger i^laces the 
two in different sections of the genus Coluber, one of which is charac- 
terized by a more, and the other by a less, distinct vertical augulatiou 
of the ends of the gastrosteges. I, however, find no difference between 
the two species in this respect. The following characters may, how- 
ever, be noted : The head in the E. lineaUcollis is larger relatively to 
the general dimensions than in the E. pleurostictus. Thus the cephalic 
plates are of equal length in two specimens of these species, of which 
the E. lineaUcollis measures 950 mm. and the E.pleurosUctus, 1,145 mm. 
The gastrosteges and urosteges are more numerous in the E. lineaU- 
collis. In this species there are in two specimens, gastrosteges 242, 
urosteges 72, and gastrosteges 234, urosteges 69. Boulenger counts 
244 + 69. In two specimens of E. pleiirosUctus I find, gastrosteges 
228, urosteges 58, and gastrosteges 221, urosteges 54. Boulenger 
gives gastrosteges 209-233, urosteges 51-67. My three specimens 
of E. lineaUcollis, like Giinther's, have twenty-seven rows of scales, 
and the three of E. pleiirosUctus before me have twenty-nine. Of 
seven specimens of the latter in the British Museum three have 
twenty-nine rows and four twenty -seven, according to Boulenger. 
Finally, the relations of the frontal and supraocular i^lates differ in the 
two. In the E. lineaUcollis the supraoculars are narrow and the frontal 
wide; in the E. pleurosUcUis the supraoculars are relatively wider. 
The shorter head of the latter species is shown in the loreal, which is 
as deej) as long, while in the E. lineaUcollis it is a little longer than 
deep. 

Measurements. — The longest specimen of this species in the U. S. 
National Museum measures 1,320 mm.; tail, 190 mm. The British 
Museum specimen measures 1,500 mm. The longest E. pleurostictus 
(Cat. No. 9005) in the U. S. National Museum measures 1,145 mm.; 
tail, 165 mm. The British Museum catalogue gives 1,690 mm. as the 
greatest length.

at one time thought to be allied to Pitijophis \n view of the presence of 
the two characters in (question, but the absence of the epiglottis aud 
undivided prefrontals show that it is distinct. There are several minor 
characters, not generic, which show that its affinities are not with the 
species of Pityophis. Such are the peculiar forms of the inferior labial, 
prenasal, and loreal plates, and the very fine bristle-like spicules of the 
hemii)enis, in the American species at least. 
Two species are known, which differ as follows : 

Scales in from 27 to 31 rows. Tail less than one-sixth the length. Brownish gray, 
with numerous transverse brown dorsal spots, with alternating lateral spots.

as to depress the form <^>f the prenasal, a peculiarity I have not observed 
in any other ISTorth American snake. Prefrontals not so long as their 
posterior width. Frontal very wide in front, the lateral borders con- 
tracting posteriorly so as to greatly diminish the posterior lateral angles 
and to give the i)late a subtriangular outline in adults. It follows that 
the superciliaries are triangular, with an oblique posterior outline. 
Parietals a little longer than wide, subtruncate posteriorly. ]^Tostril in 
a fissure, which extends obliquely downward and backward, render- 
ing each of the nasal plates subtriangular. Loreal considerably longer 
than high, with the superior border oblique downward and jiosteriorly. 
Oculars 1-2, temporals 2-4, the anterior elongate, and bounding the 
summit of the large seventh sui)erior labial. Superior labials eight, 
fourth and fifth entering orbit ; higher than long from the third to the 
sixth, inclusive. Seventh larger than usual, exceeding the sixth and 
eighth together, longer above than on the labial border. This size 
explains the absence of the usual second row of three temporals. The 
inferior labials are peculiar for their large number and unusual form. 
They number from thirteen to fourteen, and are all, therefore, deeper 
than long. This is especially the case with those from the third to the 
sixth, inclusive, which are produced in long points backward to the 
geneial plates. The seventh is the longest plate, but is separated by 
a scale from the geneial. Pregeneials of moderate length ; postgeneials 
much shorter and narrower, and separated by 2-4 rows of scales. 
Behind these there are three transverse rows of small scales, anterior 
to the first gastrosteges.

The ground color ;ibove is a grayish brown, growing paler at the 
median line. This is crossed by from fifty-five to sixty-five transverse 
brown spots anterior to the anus, which have the anterior and posterior 
borders a little darker than their central portions. These extend over 
twelve or thirteen rows of scales and are separated by spaces of one and 
a half or two scales in width. On the side is a series of spots, each of 
which is opposite a space, and is deeper than long. The scales of this 
region have their centers brown shaded, so as to obscure the distinct- 
ness of the lateral spots in some specimens. Belly yellowish- white, 
unspotted. On the nape two wide longitudinal stripes extend from 
the anterior transverse spot to the parietal plates. A blackish streak 
from eye to angle of mouth. Labials unspotted in adults, but with 
a spot under the eye in the young. 

This species is subject to some variations. Thus in Cat. No. 4266 
there is a small inferior preocular. In Oat. No. 14676 there are only

twenty-seven rows of scales, and there is a row of three temporals 
between the nsual 2-4 scaled rows. 

This species is restricted in its range to the Sonoran region. The 
most southern locality yet known is nearthe city of Chiliuahua. The most 
northern is north of the Cimarron River, probably in New Mexico. 

Mr. Bocourt objects to my placing this species in the genus BhiriecMSj 
as he says that the 7^. scalaris has the anal plate divided. It is true 
that Dum(^ril and Bibron state that this is the case, but on examining 
four specimens from the Bonaparte collection in the Museum of the 
Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, I find that the anal plate 
is entire.

This genus of Colubrine snakes includes rather large and robust 
species. They are restricted exclusively to the Nearctic realm and the 
Lower Califoruian district of the Neotropical. They are entirely ter- 
restrial in their habits, ])referring dry and even sandy regions to any 
other. They are of a harmless disposition as a general rule, but the P. 
sayi bellona defends itself vigorously when attacked. The peculiar 
epiglottis, first observed and described by Dr. C. A. White, of Wash- 
ington, aids these snakes in emitting an unusually loud hiss on the

expiration of the air contained in their volnminous lung. This sound, 
althougli it can not be called a voice, is sufficiently loud to be alarming, 
and serves, no doubt, as a defense. 

The question as to the number of species included in this genus is a 
difficult one to decide. The P. melanoleucns may be always distin- 
guished by color characters from the forms found west of the Mississippi 
Eiver. From some of these it also differs in the shape of the head and 
muzzle, but the most eastern of the western forms, P. sayi sayi, resem- 
bles it in these respects. The Lower Californian form may be distiu- 
guished from the P. melanoleucns by color characters and by the shape 
of the head and muzzle, but between it and the P. sayi of the western 
Mississippi region there is a complete transition in most of the charac- 
ters. The California form resembles that of Lower California in form,

but differs in color, while the Arizona form is in every respect interme- 
diate between the Pacific form (P. catenifer) and the P. sayi of the 
plains. These forms are tolerably constant and can be generally recog- 
nized. The form of the rostral plate is the most characteristic pecul- 
iarity, but from the nature of the case transitions occur. Under the 
circumstances, I have adopted four species, of which the P. sayi has 
two subspecies, one of which, P. s. hellona, is intermediate between its 
typical form and the P. catenifer, the latter differing, however, in the 
greater smoothness of the scales. 

SYNOPSIS OI*" SPECIES.

tral plate compressed and narrowed above; no head stripes; dorsal spots few,

Scales weakly keeled, beginning on tenth row; rostral plate not narrowed, and lit- 
tle prominent: head Hat; spots few, 40-44 on body; anteriorly red; no head 
strjijes P, veriehralis. 

The head stripes consist of a band extending from the eye to the 
angle of the mouth; another from the eye to the uiiper lip below it, and 
another connecting the orbits across the front of the frontal plate. 
These stripes are present in the young of the species, which lack them at 
maturity. The increase in the number of spots is accomplished by the 
division of those on the posterior part of the body. 

The number of the labial plates is apt to be unequal on the opposite 
side. Thus in seventy-two specimens examined, flfteen have nine 
labials on one side and eight on the other. The P. catenifer displays 
the greatest irregularity in this respect, six out of sixteen specimens 
having labials S-9.

Head ovoid, broad behind. Anteorbital one; postorbitals three. 
Dorsal rows of scales twenty-seven to thirty-one, the four outer rows 
smooth, fifth, sixth, and seventh with an obsolete keel. Tail about one- 
seventh of total length. Head spotted with black. Color of the body 
whitish, with a dorsal series of very large blotches, the twenty-fourth 
to thirtieth opposite the aims; anteriorly and posteriorly eraarginated 
on the anterior third of the body; oblong posteriorly. Elongated 
smaller blotches on the flanks, forming three indistiiict series, often 
conlluent. Abdomen unicolor. A series of twenty-seven to thirty 
distinct blotches along the extremities of the scutelhc. 

Head robust, conical. Frontal plate sub[)entagonal, broad anteriorly. 
Parietals a little larger than the frontal, and as broad anteriorly as long. 
Internal postfrontals elongated and subtriangular ; external postfrontals 
liolygonal. Prefrontals quadrilateral, separated by the rostral. fJos- 
tral narrow, very convex, raised above the surface of the snout, and 
reaching the prefrontals. Nasals very large, anterior one the larger. 
Nostrils vertically oblong, situated in the middle and between both 
plates. Loreal ovoid, small, horizontal. One large anteorbital, with its 
anterior margin convex, of the same width above as below. Three 
postorbitals, proportionally large. Temporal shields small, three or

ing into the orbit. Lower labials fourteen, fifth and. sixth largest, the 
five posterior ones quite small. Posterior pair of mental shields one- 
third of the size of the anterior pair, and reaching backward to opposite 
the middle of the lower sixth labial. Tail conical and tapering, forming 
about the seventh of the total length. 

The ground color, when living, is white; as preserved in alcohol it is 
light yellowish brown. The head is spotted in the young with black

spots, but nearly white in the adult ', frontal bar rather wide ; |)ostocular 
vitta broad in the young, but wanting in the adult. A dorsal series of 
very large blotches, of a deep chestnut-brown, broadly margined with 
black anteriorly and posteriorly. These blotches are twenty-four in 
number from the head to opposite the anus, and six on the tail, where 
they extend laterally down to the subcaudal scutelhe. More or less 
confluent, and consequently irregular in shape on the anterior third of 
the body, they are posteriorly subround or subquadrate, emarginated 
in front and behind, and separated from each other by a light spiice

embracing four scales, while the blotches themselves cover six scales. 
The Hanks are blotched but very irregularly ; ou the anterior region of 
the body the blotches elongate in the shape of longitudinal bands or 
vittffi; on the middle region three indistinct series may be traced, alter- 
nating and often confluent by their corners; posteriorly there is only 
one series opposite to the dorsal, and often confluent with it, so that 
the corresponding blotches form single patches, extending from the 
back to the abdomen, and tapering on the sides. The abdomen is dull 
yellow, with a series of distant blackish brown patches along the extrem- 
ity of the scutelhe, often extending to the outer row of scales. 

Specimens from Florida have the dark colors, rusty or rufous, instead 
of deep brown or black, and the outlines of the spots are not so well 
defined. 

This species ranges from New Jersey to Florida, preferring the sandy 
pine woods of the coastal plain. It is the largest snake of this region. 
It is of a very harmless disposition, and may be handled with impunity.

transverse jet-black bars across the tail. Abdomen yellowish, thi(;kly 
maculated with black patches. 

Head proportionally large, ovoid, distinct from the body. Snout 
pointed. Parietal plates small. Frontal broad, sub[)entagonal, slightly 
concave on the sides. Superciharies large. Internal prefrontals rather 
narrow, elongated; external prefrontals quadrilateral, a little broader 
forward. Internasals irregularly quadrangular. Kostral very narrow, 
extending halfway between the prefrontals, convex, and raised above 
the surface of the snout. Nostrils in the middle line between the nasals, 
the posterior of which is a little the smaller. Loreal trapezoidal, propor- 
tionally large. Inferior auteorbital very small, resting upon the fourth 
upper labial. Postorbitals varying in comparative size. Temporal 
shields small, resembling scales. Upper labials eight to nine, sixth 
and seventh the larger. Lower labials twelve, sixth and seventh largest. 
Posterior mental shields very small, extending to oi)posite the junction 
of the seventh and eighth lower labials. Scales proportionally small, 
in twenty-nine to thirty-three rows, the six outer ones perfectly smooth 
and somewhat larger than the remaining rows. 

Ground color yellowish-brown, with three series of dorsal black 
blotches, forty-five to sixty five in number, from the head to oi)posite 
the anus, with twelve on the tad, in the shape of transverse bars. 
Those of the medial series the larger, and covering eight or nine rows 
of scales. On the anterior part of the body they are subcircular, 
embracing longitudinally four scales; posteriorly they become shorter 
by one scale. The light spaces between are a little narrower than the 
blotches themselves for the twelve anterior blotches and wider than 
the blotches for the remaining length of the body. The blotches of the 
adjoining series alternate with those of the medial series, being oj^po- 
site to the light intermediate spaces, across which the blotches of either 
side are generally united by a transversal narrow band. The flanks 
are densely covered with small aud irregular blotches, forming three 
indistinct series, confluent in vertical bars toward the origin of the 
tail. Inferior surface of the head yellowish, unicolor. Abdomen dull 
yellow, with crowded brownish-black blotches in series on the extremity 
of the scutella. 

Baird and Girard give the following numbers of scuta and scales, 
with dimensions in inches:

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



This subspecies ranges from western Canada to the Valley of Mexico, 
inclusive. It is the common species of Texas, and even occurs iu 
Souora. It is a curious fact that this form has both the extreme 
northern and southern ranges, while the Arizonian form is so restricted. 

Two living specimens of this form were under my observation for a 
number of months. Their hissing was remarkably loud and prolonged, 
and they threw the tail into rapid vibrations, as do rattlesnakes, etc. 
They would not eat, and died of starvation.

Head ellipti(;al, rather pointed, little compressed. Vertical plate very 
broad anteriorly. A second anterior vertical, small, and siibcordiform. 
Anteorbitals two ; postorbitals four. Dorsal rows of scales twenty-nine 
to thirty- three; the seven outer rows smooth. Tail about one-twelfth 
of total length. Head maculated with black; transverse frontal bar 
extending from one orbit to the other, well marked; the oblique post- 
ocular vitta rather narrow, aud reaching the angle of the mouth. Color 
of the body whitish yellow, sometimes reddish yellow, with a dorsal 
series of deep black blotches, or of deep brown, margined with black, 
forty-five to sixty-three in number, from the head to the origin of the 
tail, and a series of smaller spots on each side. Ten transverse jet 
black bars on the tail. Flanks crowded with small and irregular 
blotches. Abdomen dull yellow, maculated with black blotches more 
or less crowded. 

Head broad behind, and well separated from the body by a con-

tracted neck, very much tapering to the end of the snout, subquadran- 
gular from the eyes forward. Ui)i)er surface flattened; snout elevated 
and rounded. Occipital plates triangular, as broad anteriorly as long. 
Superciliaries longer than either the vertical or ocoipitals. Frontal 
subpentagonal, very broad anteriorly, as broad as long, and very much 
tapering posteriorly; its sides concave. A second small subcordiform 
anterior frontal sometimes present; is situated between the external 
prefrontals, which are comparatively the larger. Internal prefrontals 
irregularly triangular, and smaller than the internasals, which are 
irregularly quadrangular. The rostral is triangular, wide below and 
narrow above, and raised but little above the surface of the snout, not 
dividing, however, the prefrontals. iTasals subquadrangular, anterior 
one a little larger; nostrils situated between the two plates, but more in 
the posterior one. Loreal very small, narrow, and elongated, horizontal 
in position. Two anteorbitals, inferior one very small; upper one very

regular, slightly convex on its anterior margin. Postorbitals four in 
number, occasionally only three, the two upper ones a little larger. 
Numerous small temporal shields. Upper labials eight (rarely nine), 
sixth and seventh somewhat larger. Lower labials thirteen, seventh 
largest; the six posterior ones the smallest. Dorsal scales elliptically 
elongated, constituting twenty-nine to tlurty-three rows, the six outer 
of which are smooth, the others carinated, the five outermost very sen- 
sibly the larger. 

The ground color is whitish yellow; on the anterior third and upper 
part of the body, the bases and sometimes the two anterior thirds of 
the scales are jet black, so as to make the ground color appear black. 
There are fifty-one large chocolate-brown viorsal blotches, margined 
with jet black from the head to opposite the anus, and ton on the tail. 
On the anterior portion of the bodj^ these blotches are subcircular, or 
rather elliptical, covering in width seven or eight rows of scales, and

four and two lialf-scales iu length; the spaces between embrace about 
two scales. Posteriorly the blotches become quadrate, and the inter- 
mediate spaces increase so as to be at first equal to the blotches, and 
toward the origin of the tail they are actually wider by one scale than 
the blotches themselves. On the tail the blotches assume the shape of 
narrow transverse bars, tapering downward. On each side of the dor- 
sal blotches is a series of much smaller and somewhat irregular blotches 
margined with black, the blotches being opposite to the light sjiaces, 
alternating, but not confluent with the medial blotches. On the ante- 
rior tlurd of the body a series of small blotches is observed on the

exhibit a tendency to become obsolete vertical bars, more apparent 
posteriorly in very large individuals, giving to the flanks a nebulous 
appearance. The head above is yellowish brown, with small black 
spots on the vertex and occiput. Frontal black bar distinct in small 
individuals, obsolete in very large ones; postorbitalvitta narrow; sub- 
orbital spot small. Inferior surface of the head and abdomen light 
straw color, with an external series of distant black spots on each side, 
confluent under the tail, and constituting a medial band. Tail neither 
ringed nor longitudinally striped below with brown or black.

Of sixteen specimens examined, twelve have 8-8 superior labials, 
two have 8-9, and two have 9-9. Four have tweuty-nine rows of 
scales, nine have thirty-one, 
and two have thirty-three. 
Six have between forty and 
fifty dorsal spots on the 
body; eight have between 
filty and sixty, and two have 
sixty to sixty-three. About 
two-thirds have the centers 
of the dorsal spots paler 
than the borders, and the 
remainder have the spots 
black throughout. The only 
constant character of this 

snbs])ecies as compared with P. sayi is the form of the rostral plate; 
but Cat. No. 8401 is intermediate between the two in this respect. Some 
specimens from Oregon are intermediate between it and the F. catenifer. 

The geographical range of this subspecies is the Great Basin from 
Oregon south, the basin of the Coh)rado, and Arizona. 

The typical specimen of the Ghurchillia hellona Baird and Girard, 
which can not now be found, came from the valley of the Itio Grande, 
which is also the habitat of the P. sayi sayi. The second specimen 
enumerated in Baird and Girard's Catalogue under the P. hellona is 
from western Texas, between San Antonio and El Paso, and hence 
from the same region as the type. This specimen belongs to the P. sayi 
sayi.

and two or three posteriorly. The spaces between the blotches are of 
the width of one to two scales for the whole length of the body, as in 
P. sayi. A lateral series of blotches on each side of the medial, cover- 
ing three rows of scales, and alternating with the median series. A 
series of blotches along the middle of the flanks opposite to those of 
the median dorsal series. On the anterior part of tlie body the lateral 
blotches are eh)ngated and occasionally combine into a band or vitta 
behind the neck. On the anterior third of the body an indistinct series 
of black spots may be seen between the scuta and the outer series of

not ringed and has no stripe on the middle line below. 

In the young the middle region of the abdomen is unicolor, and the 
external series of spots only exists, which, together with the series on 
the middle of the flanks, are most conspicuous.

Of seventeen specimens examined, seven have the superior labials 
8-9; eight have 8-8; and two have 9-9. Four have twenty-nine rows 
of scales; ten have thirty-one rows; one has thirty-three; and one has 
thirty-five (Cat. IS^o. 2243). The number of spots on the body is very 
variable. One has thirty-six dorsal spots (Cat. No. 1546) ; one has 
forty six (Cat. No. 1532); seven have between fifty and sixty; four have 
between sixty and seventy; and four have over seventy, the highest 
being seventy-nine (Cat. No. 1816). The specimen (Cat. No. 5741) on 
which the P. icilkesii Baird and Girard was founded is abnormal in the 
nondi vision of the prefrontal scuta; the only example I have observed 
in the genus. 

The range of this species is coterminous with the Pacific region, 
extending from San Diego on the south to Puget Sound on the north. 
It is found in the Mohave Desert, and at Pyrmont, Nevada (Cat. 
No. 8139). Northward it extends to eastern Oregon and to Walla 
Walla, Washington.

Scales in from thirty-one to thirty-five rows, the exterior ten 'or twelve 
entirely smooth, the central faintly carinate; the scales three times as 
wide as long near the middle of the body. 

Head distinct, elongate, depressed, especially upon the region of the 
coronal suture. Occipital shield as long as the vertical, but subject, 
as in other species of the genus, to subdivision. Length of the vertical, 
one and a half times the anterior breadth, the superciliary borders con- 
cave and slightly divergent posteriorly. Posterior angle obtuse. Post- 
frontals four, elongate, all bordering the vertical. Eostral not promi- 
nent; as broad as high, possessing six sutural borders, the nasal twice 
as long as any of the others. Nasal shields large, loreal longer than 
high. Preoculars normally two, sometimes three or one. Postoculars 
three, exceptionally four. Sui)erior labials normally niiu^ (exct^ption- 
ally ten), the fifth entering the orbit. Inferior labials normally twelve; 
geneials two pair, anterior twice the length of the posterior. Tail one- 
seventh of the total length. Gastroteges two hundred and forty-seven, 
an entire anal, urosteges sixty-one. 

MeasKrements.— Total length, 5 feet 4 inches; tail, 9 inches. 

The ground color above and below is a rich straw-yellow. The muzzle 
is shaded anteriorly with ashy or brown; this color gradually fades 
into a. lively sanguineous or testaceous, which tint prevails upon the 
posterior part of the head and anterior part of the body. There arises 
upon the tenth or eleventh row of the scales of the neck upon each side

a longitudinal band of the same color, which deepens posteriorly, and 
unites with its fellow at intervals of three or four scales by a gradual 
widening upon its dorsal border. Thus a scalariform series of dorsal 
blotches is formed, whose transverse diameter increases regularly pos- 
teriorly, and whose intervals diminish, being anteriorly four scales, 
upon the tail one and a half. The connecting band remains unbroken 
upon the anterior fourth of the body only. Separated from this by an 
interval of one half or a whole scale, another longitudinal and very 
narrow band arises on the neck. It is much more distinct opposite the

the line connecting the latter j)artially assumes its position, and breaks 
up into an alternating series of very elongated spots. The dorsal inter- 
vals are thus widened to a breadth of seven and two halves scales. 
There also begins upon the neck a second lateral series of spots, 
which occupy a length of live scales on the fourth, fifth, and sixth rows. 
Their length decreases to three scales opposite the anus, where they 
unite with the superior lateral series. Every second pair of gastro- 
steges is tipped with sanguineous. All the markings of this serpent 
are sanguineous anteriorly, but deeper posteriorly, passing through

OSCEOLA Baird and Girard. 

Osceola Baikd and Girabd, Cat. Rept. N. Amer., Pt. 1, Serpents, 1853, p. 133. — 
Cope, Trans. Anier. Phil. Soc, 1895, p. 204. 

Posterior maxillary teeth larger and more robust than the anterior, 
not separated from them by an interspace. Hemipenis colubriform, 
with numerous fringed calyces. Cephalic plates normal; anal plate 
entire; urosteges two rows. Scales with two apical pits. 

This genus is intermediate between the Coronelline type of snakes 
and the Colubrine. The scutellation and dentition are identical with 
those of the genus OphiboluSy but the hemipenis is of a very different 
character, being identical with that of Coluber, Fhrynonax, etc. The 
dentition separates it rather weakly from the latter genus. It ranges 
from the eastern district of the Medicolumbian to the Columbian 
region of the Neotropical realm, inclusive. 

I know of but two species of this genus. They were formerly referred 
to Ophibolus. They differ as follows: 

Temporal scuta 2-2-3; scales in 21 rows; a loreal; spotted or annulate, larger. 

U. doliata Linnaius. 
Temporal scuta 1-2-3; scales in 17-19 rows; no loreal; annulate; smaller.

882 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Loreal small, longer than bigli; one preocular, two postoculars. Tem- 
porals 2-2 (rarely 1-2). Frontal ratlier wide, narrowing the super- 
ciliaries in front. Parietals ratlier wide, the length a little less than 
that of frontal and prefrontals combined. Seven superior labials, all 
higher than long except the first, the third and fourth bounding the 
orbit. Geueials, the anterior about twice the size of the posterior. 
Size medium to small. 

The ground color of the superior surfaces varies from ashen to bright 
yellow, but it only appears as transverse spaces between the broad 
reddish-brown to crimson spots or saddles which cross the back. The 
extent to which these spots preserve their outlines or surround the 
body like rings forms the indication of the characters of various sub- 
species. The coloration of the head varies from red or black abruptly 
cut off posteriorly, to banded with two chevrons, a brown within a 
yellow one, with a yellow cross-band on the nose. 

■ The variations of this species are remarkable and form the subject 
of some remarks I made on former occasions, and which 1 now quote :^ 

The most northern and the most southern forms of the genus Osceola, the 0. trian- 
gula and 0. coccinea, have always been regarded as distinct species; and so iinmerous 
are their differential characters in coloration, size, and squamation that tliis view 
wonld seem to rest on a satisfactory foundation. I iind, however, that individuals 
exist which represent every stage of development of each character which distin- 
guishes them, although certain types appear to be more abundant than the interme- 
diate ones. 0. irUinyula is a species of larger size, with two temporal jilates, a 
row of large brown dorsal spots, and other smaller ones on the sides, on a grayish 
ground, with a chevron, and often other marks on the top of the head, and a baud 
posterior to the eye. 0. coccinea is a small snake with a small loreal plate and one 
temporal shield; color red, with pairs of black rings extending round the body, and 
no markings on the head excepting that the anterior ring of the anterior pair crosses 
the posterior edge of the occipital shields, forming a half collar. The transiticm is 
accomplished thus: The lateral borders of the dorsal sj)ots of O. triani/ula break 
up, and the lateral spots become attached to their anterior and posterior dark bor- 
ders. The chevron of the top of the head first breaks into spots, and then its pos- 
terior portions unite with each other. The borders of the old dorsal spots continue 
to the abdomen, where the remaining lateral portions finally meet on the middle line, 
forming a black line. This breaks up and disappears, leaving the annuli open ; and 
these are then completed in many siiecimens. The general colors become more bril- 
liant and the size smaller. The head is more depressed ; in immediate relation to 
this form, the loreal plate is reduced in size, and the two temporal shields of O. tri- 
angula are sometimes reduced to one. Every form of combination of these char- 
acters can be found, which represent five species of the books (in North America), 
viz: O. trianyula, 0. doliata, 0. annulata, 0. (lentilis, and O. coccinea. The oldest name 
is the 0. doliata Linn. Another series of specimens resemble very closely those 
of the subspecies coccinea; in fact, are identical with them in color. The loreal 
shield is, however, extinguished, and the rows of scales are reduced by one on each 
side. These specimens simply carry one degree further the modifications already 
described. Yet, on account of the constancy of these characters, I am compelled to 
regard these individuals not only as a distinct species, but, on account of the absence 
of the loreal plate, as belonging to another genus. This is the Calamaria elapsoidea 
of Holbrook; the Osceola elapsoidea of Baird and Girard. It affords an illustration

of tlie principle, Avliich I have elsewhere insisted on, ''that adjacent species of allied 
genera may bo more alike than remote species of identical generic characters," which 
indicates that generic characters originate independently of the specific. 

The transitions above noted are not, however, without mutual corre- 
lations. The chaiaeters are found so associated in such a great major- 
ity of the specimens as to indicate the existence of subspecies whose 
definitions are given below. Exceptions to these are given under the 
head of each subspecies. 

I. No yellow band posteriorly from orbit (a yellow half collar). 

(X. Dorsal spots or saddles (red) open at the side, their adjacent borders forming 
pairs of black rings. 
Interspaces between red saddles open below ; scales not black tipped ; front

tipped ; front black ; first black ring complete O. d. •pohjzona. 

Interspaces not closed ; rings, including first, complete on belly ; first yel- 
low baud crossing occipital plates; front black; scales not black

aa Dorsal saddle spots closed at the sides. 

(5 Saddles closed by a single black tract on the middle of the belly ; no spots 
between saddles. 
Dorsal spots undivided medially ; front black ; first black ring complete. 

0. d. annulata. 
Dorsal spots divided longitudinally by a median black connection ; front

/3/3 Lateral borders of saddles not confluent with each other below. 

Saddles completed on gastrosteges ; no alternating spots; no black 

collar 0. d. paraUela. 

Saddles completed oij gastrosteges ; siiots opposite intervals forming a 

single series on the middle line of the belly O. d. sysjrila. 

Saddles completed above the gastrosteges; alternating spots which do 
not meet on the middle lino of the belly O. d. doliata. 

II. A yellow baud from orbit bounded below by a black or brown one. (Saddle 

spots closed laterally above gastrosteges ; superciliary light spots or 

bands.) 
A half collar touching occipital plates, no bands; alternate spots largely on 

gastrosteges 0. d. coUaris. 

Neck with longitudinal bands; alternate spots largely on gastrosteges. 

0. d. clcrica. 
Neck with bands; alternate spots entirely on scales O. d. triangula. 

The more detailed transition from the simple head coloration of the 
0. d. coccinea to the complex pattern of the 0. d. triangula is accom- 
plished as follows : 

A yellowish spot is seen on the superciliary plate of the single si)eci- 
men of the 0. d. paraUela known, and on three of the fifteen specimens 
of the 0. d. sijspUa. It appears in all of the thirteen 0. d. doliata, and 
in two of these they nearly join across the front, and in three they join 
forming a cross band. In four specimens of the 0. d. doliata a notch 
of the black anterior border of the nuchal collar appears on each side. 
The depressing of this notch till it reaches the eye defines the two post- 
ocular stripes of the subspecies of Section II of the preceding table. 



884 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



It has not quite reached the orbit in Cat. Kos. 7849 and 2192 of the 0. d. 
collar is. The superciliary spots have not united across the front in any 
of the five specimens 0. d. collaris, excepting in Cat. No. 5449. In Cat. 
No. 2433 it is nearly completed. The interorbital and postorbital bands 
are complete in the subspecies 0. d. clerica and 0. d. triangula. Finally, 
the completion of the head ornamentation is seen in the perfect defini- 
tion of the anterior boundary of the brown band in front of the inter 
orbital light band. This is seen in three individuals of the 0. d. doliata, 
in four of the 0. d. collaris, all of the 0. d. clerica, and in three of the 
five 0. d. triangula. In one of the latter it is simply indistinct; in 
another it is converted into a median spot by a yellow band, which 
extends from the interorbital band around the canthus uostralis and 
end of muzzle. 

This species furnishes them a most instructive illustration of the 
origin of color characters. 

The geographical distribution of the Osceola doliata extends from lat- 
itude 48^ through the eastern Austroriparian and southern part of the 
central district, and throughout Mexico and Central America to Panama. 
It is wanting from the Pacific and from the Sonoran districts. ]t does 
.not appear on the west coast of Mexico north of Colima and Michoacan. 

The phylogenetic relations of these subspecies may be sketched as 
follows : 

r/fM/VGl/l/l 



Clerica 



Semicollaris 



Doliata, 



POLYZONA- 



Syspila 



Occipitalis- 



COCCINEA 



Parallel A 



Annulata 

Which is the ancestral form is uncertain, but as the region inhabited 
by the 0. d. triangula is much older geologically than that where the 
0. d. coceinea is found, the former is probably the primitive type. 

The geographical distribution of the subspecies is related to their 
characters. 0. d. coceinea is exclusively a form of the Gulf border, and 
0. d. triangula is northern, and is not recorded from south of Washing- 
ton, District of Columbia. The other found in the same series occupy 
the intermediate latitudes. The polyzona, occipitalis, and annulatas 
are Mexican, and the 0. d. parallela is Floridan. The color increases 
in brilliancy to the south, as the 0. d. triangula is brown spotted and 
the 0. d. coceinea crimson. The size diminishes in general in the same 
direction, the species recovering its size in Mexico.

pitals. General color above yellowish-gray, with a dorsal series of 
large blotches, tifty-five in number from the head to the tip of the tail, 
the forty- fifth opposite to the anus. These are. transversely elliptical, 
about four scales long, covering twelve to fifteen scales across the back 
(more anteriorly than posteriorly), and separated by intervals of one 
and a half to two scales, all of nearly the same width. The spots them- 
selves are grayish-brown or chocolate, with a broad black border, and 
finely mottled internally (as is the ground color on the sides) with black. 
The blotches become narrower posteriorly; on the tail tlieir confluence 
with the lateral series forms black half rings. On each side, and involv- 
ing the second to the fifth rows, is another series of much smaller and 
nearly circular blotches, black with the centers brown.. These alter- 
nate with the dorsal spots. Alternating with the series just described 
is still another similar to it, but entirely black, on the nmrgin of the 
abdomen, and on the contiguous spots of the first, second, and third 
rows. These two lateral series are sometimes confluent. The anterior 
dorsal blotch is elongated, so as to cover the })osterior half of the

vertical plate, and in it is a central elongated spot of the ground color 
behind the occipitals. A double light spot is seen on the junction of 
the occipitals. There is a dark band across the posterior half of the 
postfrontals, and another from the eye to the angle of the mouth. The 
labials are edged with black. 

The abdomen is yellowish-white, with square black blotches, alter- 
nating with those already described. 

The number and size of these spots varies somewhat in diilereut 
specimens, though rarely less than forty from head to anus. The young 
differ in having the dorsal blotches bright chestnut-red inside of the 
black margins. The intervals are sometimes white or clear ash.

This subspecies, the common " milk snake," is abundant in the Middle 
States. It is very harmless in its manners, and useful in its habits. It 
lives on the small Mammalia, which are so injurious to the farmer. I 
once caught a specimen of this species which had captured a family of 
the Arvicola riparia, which it held in the following manner: One it had 
swallowed, one it was in the act of swallowing, and two others were 
securely held in two turns of the body so tightly as to render them 
incapable of biting their captor. 

This form ranges farther north tlian any other representative of the 
genus. It is recorded by Professor A. I]. Yerrill as being common at 
Norway, Maine.

This subspecies is intermediate between the 0. d. doliata and the 0. 
d. clerica, as may be learned from the analytical table. In its head 
coloration there is variation in the development of the interorbital 
light cross band. It is complete in Cat. Nos. 2433 and 5449 only; in 
Cat. Nos. 2192 and 7849 it is represented by large superciliary spots, 
and in Cat. No. 9745 by small ones. The yellow postocular band is not 
complete in Cat. ISTo. 7849. In Cat. No. 2433 the yellow half collar is 
interrupted on each side by the slight contact of the dark borders of 
the head color and tlie first saddle si)ot, showing how the neckbands 
of the two subspecies clerica and triangida are formed.

General characters much as in 0. d. triangula. Top of head and nape 
with a longitudinal reddish black-edged spot which embraces a Y-shaped 
yellow spot in its center. A small mediam parietal si)ot. A pale 
cross band between orbits, and a brown band on the prefrontal plates, 
which continues as a black band from the eye to the angle of the 
mouth, crossing the last two superior labial plates. Labials with dusky 
mutual borders. 

The body is crossed by a series of thirty-eight to forty-eight dorsal 
blotches, there being nine or ten on the tail. They are much broader

and larger than in 0. eximia, and extend between the outer dorsal 
rows. These blotches are chocolate, lighter on the sides, and distinctly 
bordered with black; they are about five or six scales long. The inter- 
vals between the blotches are mottled ash, or pepper and salt. On 
each side is a second alternating series of black blotches, much smaller 
than the dorsal, and extending from the exterior dorsal row on the 
edge of the abdominal scutellaj. Beneath yellowish white, with dis- 
tinct quadrate black blotches, opposite to the large dorsal spots, mostly 
divided on the middle line. 

The body, viewed from above, appears encircled by a series of black 
rings in pairs, inclosing a third of an ash color. The tints, as usual, are 
darker on the back.

OSCEOLA DOLIATA SYSPILA Cope. 

OphiboJus dolidtiis syspilus Cope, Proc. U. S. \at. Mus., XI, 1888, p. 384. 

Head small, flattened above, with the snout rounded; neck slightly 
contracted; body elongated, rather slender; scarlet above, and jnarked 
with black rings, in pairs; between each pair is a white ring. 

The vertical plate is pentagonal, with an acute angle behind; the 
superior orbitals are oblong-quadrilateral, broadest behind, and not 
projecting over the eye; the occipitals are polygonal, and very large; 
the frontals are broad and pentagonal, narrowest externally, where they 
descend to join an elongate quadrilateral, loreal i)late. The anterior 
frontals are also quadrilateral, smaller than the jiosterior, and broadest 
externally. The rostral plate is large, heptagonal, and concave below. 
There are two nasal plates, the jDosterior square, the anterior lunated 
behind for the nostril, which does not enter the posterior, but comes 
out at its anterior border. There is a single anterior orbital plate, 
oblong, slightly concave behind, and two small, subround, posterior 
orbitals. The inferior wall of the orbit is made up of the third and 
fourth superior labial plates, of which there are seven. 




Fig. 216. 

Osceola doliata syspila Cope. 

X 1.5. 

The nostrils are lateral and near the snout. The eyes are small, the 
iris bright reddish gray. The neck is but slightly contracted, and is 
covered with small, smooth, subhexagonal scales. The body is long, 
tolerably stout, and covered above with scales similar to those of the 
neck, but larger. The tail is rather short, thick at its root, but soon 
becomes smaller, and terminates in a tip. 

The anterior top of the head is crossed with a black band at the 
extremities of the occipitals, and the dark color may extend as far as 
the prefrontal plates, inclusive. The body is scarlet, banded with 
twenty-two i)airs of jet black rings, with a white ring between each 
pair of black. These rings do not completely surround the body, as in 
Osceola elapsoldea, but the lower part of the anterior ring of one j)air 
is continued within the margins of the gastrosteges, with the jiosterior 
ring of another pair, but always at a considerable distance on each side 
of the middle line. 

The belly is marked with a single series of medium black spots, which 
are oi)posite the spaces between the dorsal saddles, or opposite the 
yellow rings. These spots represent the confluent lateral spots of the 



892 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



0. d, doUata, clerica, etc., as shown in the analytical table of the sub- 
species. Their complete fusion with the black rings, and the oblitera- 
tion of the lateral closing lines of the saddle spots would give us the 
0. d. annulata. The division of these median spots on the middle liue, 
and their transposition to the sides, with the elevation of the lateral 
closing lines of the saddles to a point above the gastrosteges, would 
give us the 0. d. doliata. 

This subspecies is well sustained by sixteen specimens in the U. S. 
National Museum. 

There are four partly distinct types of head coloration among these 
specimens. In Cat. Nos. 13008, 12925, 8345 the front is black to the end 
of the muzzle. In Cat. Nos. 1846, 2296, 4291 the end of the muzzle only 
is red. In Cat. Nos. 303 and 7850 the top of the head is reddish brown, 
and superciliary spots are present. In Cat. Nos. 13361, 13380, and an 
unnumbered specimen the top of the head is a uniform red or reddish 
gray; and in Cat. No. 21163 the upper surface is red, except the frontal 
plate and a broad band to the black collar, which are black. In this 
specimen there is no loreal plate on either side. There are only nine- 
teen rows of scales, and the superior temporal of the first row is abnor- 
mally small. In these respects it approaches the 0. elapsoidea.

OSCEOLA DOLIATA PARALLELA Cope. 

Ophibolns ilolialus 2)arallelu8 Cope, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XI, 1888, p. 385. 
Scales in twenty one rows; rather short and wide. Head distinct, 
muzzle not prominent. Kostral plate very little visible from above, 
muzzle short. Frontal wide ; occipital nearly as long- as frontal and pre- 
frontals. Loreal well developed, longer than higli; oculars 1-2; tem- 
porals 2-2-3. The seven superior labials are all higher than long, the 
third and fourth bounding orbit. Postgeneials half as long as pregen- 
eials. 

Back crossed by saddles of brownish red (in alcohol) with black bor- 
ders, which extend to the gastrosteges and there close by the longitudi- 
nal direction of the black border. These borders of opposite sides form 

parallel longitudinal 
black lines. The sad- 
dles are long, covering 
on an average nine 
scales. There are twenty 
of them in front of the 
anus in the type speci- 
men. They are separated 
by yellow intervals of 
one and a half scales in width. There are no lateral or ventral spots 
o})i)osite to these alternating with the principal ones. The ground 
color below is yellowish. The top of the head is reddish brown 
bounded i)Osteriorly by black, which crosses the posterior border of 
the occipital scuta. This is followed by a yellow half collar, which is 
followed by the black exterior border of the first dorsal saddle, and 
which turns backward along the ends of the gastrosteges like the 
others. A yellowish black-edged spot on each superciliary plate, and 
a similar one on the canthus rostralis, which sends a short branch 
along the anterior border of the prefrontal. Superior parts of superior 
labials black, inferior parts yellow. 

Cat. No. 10544; upper labials, 7; gastrosteges, 210 4- 1 ; urosteges, 46; scales, 21; 
total length, 325 iniu; tail 42, mm. 

This subspecies occupies an interesting intermediate position between 
0. d. annulata and 0. d. syspila. It differs from the former in the non- 
fusion of the lateral saddle borders and the absence of a black collar; 
from the latter in the absence of intermediate spots on the middle of 
the belly and the close approximations of the borders of the saddles.

Marcy's Report Expl. Red River, 1853, p. 229, pi. viii. 

Ground-color dull red, encircled by twenty-five pairs of black rings, 
the twenty-first opposite the anus, each pair inclosing a third ring of 
yellowish white. The black rings are conspicuously broader above, the 
three crossing eight scales on the vertebral row anteriorly, and toward 
the anus about five. Anteriorly the intervals between successive pairs 
consist of about five scales, posteriorly only of two or three, thus 
diminishing considerably. The black rings contract as they descend, 

those of each pair reced- 
ing slightly from each 
other, so as to cause the 
yellow j)ortion to expand 
about one scale. The 
black rings are contin- 
uous on the abdomen, 
those of contiguous pairs 
(not of the same pair) 
sometimes with their in- 
tervening spaces black. 
The scales in the white 
rings are always more or 
less mottled with black, 
especially along the sides 
of the body, this mottling 
being very rarely observ- 
able on the red x^ortion. The anterior black ring of the first pair is 
extended so as to cover the whole head above, except the very tip; 
the yellow ring behind it involves the extreme tip of the occipitals. 
The black rings extend on the back so that the contiguous rings of 
adjacent pairs run into each other. There are twenty-eight pairs of 
rings, the twenty-fifth opposite the anus. The lateral borders of the 
saddle spots are fused into a single large median black spot on the 
abdomen, inclosing the extremities of the gastrosteges within the area 
of the dorsal saddle. The abdomen opposite the yellow interspaces is 
not spotted.

The markings of this subspecies are quite as in the 0. d. fmnulata, 
except that the black edges of the dorsal spots do not approach each 
other in that form. Tiie scales are also narrower in the 0. d. gentilis. 
The form is rare, as only one specimen is known to me.

and a half scales longitudinally on the vertebral region and narrowing 
but little laterally. The inclosed yellow rings are one and a half scales 
wide on the vertebral region. The first three pairs of black rings 
behind the head are, with those inclosed, a little wider. The intervals 
of red ground-color occnpy four or five scales on the middle of the body,

The variations presented by this series are instructive as showing 
the connections between these forms. In Cat. No. 711G the abdominal 
black patches are divided by a pale longitudinal median line, which 
constitutes such a separation of the inferior T)orders of the saddle 
spots as characterizes the 0. d. parallela. The head lias the normal 
color. In Cat. No. 17031 these black patches are obsolete except as to 
the posterior four or five. It thus approaches the 0. d. conjuncta Jan 
of Mexico, which it also resembles in head coloration. Cat. No. 17032, 
from the same locality, is colored typically. 

The most northern locality from which I know this speci&s is San 
Aiigelo, Texas, from which place I have received it from Mr. Otto 
Lerch. 

The 0. doliata conjuncta^ is from Mexico generally, but it has not yet 
been found near the border. 

The 0. d. polyzona"^ is also very abundant in Mexico, especially in the 
Sierra Caliente. It ranges as far south as Panama. It is brilliantly 
colored, and reaches the full dimensions of the species.

Head rather more depressed than in the species of the other sections. 
The lower postocular, which is smaller than the upper, rests in a notch 
between the fourth and fifth upper labials, lying longitudinally against 
the latter. In many other species the contact is not so intimate. 

Color in life, bright red. The body is encircled by twenty-four pairs 
of black rings (the nineteenth opposite the anus), each pair inclosing a 
yellow ring between them. Along the back the black and yellow rings 
are nearly of equal width, the three covering a length on the back of

five or six scales. Anteriorly their intervals are eight or nine scales 
long, posteriorly somewhat less. The black rings, as they descend on 
the sides, separate somewhat, so as to leave an interval of about three 
scales; they are also somewhat narrower than above. On the abdomen 
they are generally interrupted, the corresponding ends of the same 
ring sometimes meeting and sometimes alternating. The posterior 
black ring of the first pair does not continue under the throat. The 
anterior black ring of the first pair crosses the posterior part of the 
occipitals, extending across between the angles of the mouth. The head 
in front of this is black, except the end of the muzzle and the adjacent 
labial plates, which are red. The narrow spaces between the black 
rings are dusted with black. The posterior edges of the labials are 
black.

Fourteen specimens fall within the above definition of this sub- 
species. But some of these present slight anomalies. Thus Cat. No. 0069 
has but one temporal on one side. Three other specimens are more 
peculiar. Cat. iS^o. 2299 has the front reddish, with a small, yellow, brown- 
edged spot on the common suture of the parietals, which foreshadows 
the median spot or chevron of the 0. d. triangula. Of Cat. No. 2312, from 
northern Louisiana, one has but one temporal on one side, and the 
superior temporal very narrow in the other; and in both the face is red 
and the muzzle prominent and depressed, as in Osceola elapsoidea. In 
one of them the loreal is wanting from both sides, while in the other it 
is present on both sides. These specimens are annectent to the sjiecies 
above named.

While this form graduates on the one side into the Osceola elapsoidea, it 
approximates, on the other, nearly to the 0. d. conjuncta Jan of Mexico on 
the other. In fact, it is principally distinguished from the latter by its 
inferior size.

Scales ill twenty-one or twenty -three longitudinal rows, rather wide 
and obtuse. Head little distinct. Plates of the head much as in 0. d. 
doliata, the superciliaries narrow and the frontal wide, and the longi- 
tudinal line of suture of the occipitals only three-fourths, of the length 
of the latter plate. The outer borders of the occipitals present two 
posterior divaricating angles, and one on each side at the end of the 
first temporal. Upper labials seven, third and fourth entering the orbit ; 
inferior labials nine, the seventh twice as large as the last two together.

body is conipletely encircled by ten or more pairs of jet-black rings, 
which vary in the degree of their distinctness, and are continued across 
the belly. The space included in each jiair is three or four scales wide, 
and is red, each scale having a black tip. The tail is ornamented with 
two pairs of black rings and a black tip. Anterior to the first pair of 
rings a black collar four scales wide encircles the neck, scarcely 
touching the tips of the occipitals; the superciliary frontal, excej^t its 
anterior border, and the occipitals within a line drawn diagonally from 
the j>osterior termination of their suture to the lower postocular, are 
black. A spot below the eye, one on the chin, the end of the muzzle, 
and the posterior borders of most of the other i)lates of the head are 
black. The spaces inclosed between the black spaces, which cross the 
parietal and internasal plates, are yellow. 

This brilliantly colored subspecies varies very much in the develop- 
ment and relations of the black rings. Several of the forms are beau- 
tifully figured by both Bocourt and Giinther, as above cited. Boulen- 
ger gives the following variations as having come under his observation :' 

A. Aunuli separated by broad red interspaces; red scales uot tipped with black. 

B. Aunnli separated by broad red interspaces, the scales of which are tipped with 

black. 

C. Black rings, irregular; belly black. 

D. Black with yellow rings, the red color appearing on each side as rounded spots. 

E. Eed above, each scale tipped with black, the rings reduced to mere traces here 

and there. 

F. Almost uniform black, with very indistinct traces of light annuli. 

The presence of twenty-three rows of scales is not uncommon. 

This subspecies belongs to the Central American subregion of Neo- 
tropica, and I have not seen it from the plateau, but described it from 
three specimens from Jalapa in the Tierra Templada, in the museum 
of the Philadelphia Academy. Duges, however, records it from Gua- 
najuato, and Boulenger mentions specimens from the City of Mexico 
and from Amula, Guerrero, so that it must be introduced here. Bou- 
lenger's A and B are the most common varieties, B more so than A.

900 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

At the same date I described this subspecies under two names, 
Ophibolns micropholis and 0. polyzonus. On finding them to be identi- 
cal I selected for the form the name ^'•polyzomis^'''' although it appeared 
on the page following the one on which " micropholis''^ was printed. The 
name '■'' polyzonus'''' has been repeatedly used since, while the name 
'•'■ micropliolis''^ has been allowed to disappear. Dr. Boulenger, however, 
in his Catalogue of Snakes in the British Museum, revives the latter name 
without explanation, but probably because it appeared one page earlier 
than the name ^'■polyzonus.'''' I think this course unjustifiable and calcu- 
lated to produce confusion. It is generally understood that of two i 
names simultaneously published, an author has the right to select 
whichever one he chooses when the two apply to the same thing. 
Moreover, Boulenger regards it as a full species, whereas formerly he 
agreed with me that it can only be maintained as a subspecies of the 
Osceola doliata. If one examines the analytical table or compares the 
diagnoses of this and the allied forms in the Catalogue of the British i 
Museum he will not find- any characters given to substantiate this * 
change of view, but rather evidence that the first opinion of Dr. Bou- 
lenger was the correct one. 

Sumichrast in his manuscript notes, says of this subspecies: 

Among the numerous Mexican snakes which are called " coralillas," this one attains 
the Inrgest dimensions. It is distributed throughout the warm and temperate 
regions, but disappears in the alpine region, where, at least, I have never observed 
it. This snake prefers shaded localities, as plains covered with tall herbs and along ; 
rivers. Although of a very harmless disposition, it is not easily caught, since on i 
being alarmed it glides swiftly through the vegetation and is not long in disappear- 
ing in the gallery excavated by some other animal. It also lives in the enormous 
nests of the ant Orcodoma Inexicana, on which it warms itself iu the sun. Although 
entirely inoffensive, it does not escape the charge of being poisonous, as all the 
coralillas are supposed to be by the natives.

Body subcylindrical, deeper than broad; tail forming about the 
eighth of the total length. Scales rhomboidal, perfectly smooth, con- 
stituting nineteen rows; the outer row slightly broader than the rest. 

Ground color brilliant red 
above, fading below, annnlated 
with fifteen pairs of jet-black 
rings from head to anus, and 
three pairs on the tail, each pair 
inclosing a whire ring. Head 
from the eyes to the snout red, 
vertical plate maculated with 
black. A black bar across the 
occipitals to the temporal shields, 
and another on the ne(;k, between 
which is a yellowish ring, narrow 
above, and spreading over the 
angle of the mouth, posterior up- 
per labials, and inferior surface 
of the head. The black rings 
cover from two to three scales, and the intermediate white, one scale. 
The red spaces between the black embrace from four to seven scales. 
The black rings taper toward the sides, while the white ones are 
spreading.

The relations of this species to the 0. doliafa coccinea are interesting. 
The characters of typical examples of the two are clear enough, but in 
one specimen and another they all fall. Florida specimens are gener- 
ally true to those of 0. elapsoidca, but in the other (Julf States excep- 
tions occur. Thus, Cat. No. 5560 (Columbus, Georgia), is a coccinea with 



902 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

ouly uiueteeu row.s of scales. In Cat. Nos. 10743, 9681), 20137, otherwise 
true elapsoidea, a loreal plate is present. In Gat. No. 17924 otherwise a 
true elapsoidea, the first row of temporals consists of two scales, the 
upper well developed on one side and rudimental on the other. In the 
following specimens there are only seventeen rows of scales: Cat. I^os. 
2305, 11988, 13644, 17391, 18030, all from Florida. These are all elap- 
soidea in scutal characters except Cat. 'No. 11988, which has a loreal on 
one side. I have in my private collection a specimen with one loreal. 
The rostral plate is more prominent in the 0. elapsoidea than in the 
0. d. coccinea. 

I suspect that this species has been derived from the 0. d. coccinea 
by a process of reduction of scale formula?, accompanying reduction in 
size. The transitional stages have been in fact discovered, as above 
jwinted out, in a few individuals, which are much less numerous than 
those of the two types.

Posterior maxillary teeth larger and stronger than the anterior. 
Head but little distinct. Cephalic scuta normal. Eostral plate not 
modified; loreal present; one preocular. Scales smooth, with two 
apical pits. Anal scutum entire; subcaudal scuta in two rows. Pupil 
round. Hemipenis with very few calyces and many spines; former 
apical, not fringed. 

This genus represents in North America the Coronella of the Old 
World, but is abundantly distinct in its entire anal scutum, its double 
scale pits, and the reduced number of its penial calyces. Its six species 
form a very homogeneous group, and although they present abundant 
differences to the eye, critical examination shows that their characters 
are by no means easy to determine. Some of them {0. getiilus) offer 
a degree of variation within themselves which is not equaled by any 
other North American species with the exception of the Eutcenia sir- 
talis. They afford excellent lessons in the evolution of specific types. 

The subtraction of the former 0. doliatus and its reference to the 
Osceola, leaves Ophiholus exclusively Nearctic in distribution, and it is 
found in every part of the realm except the extreme Northwest and the 
Canadian district. 

The species differ as follows: 

Temporal scuta, 2-3-4. 

a. Scales in 21-3 rows. 

Eight superior labials; numerous brown dorsal saddle spots closed at the 
sides 0. multistratus. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 903

Seven labials: robust, head not distinct; light brown with small transverse 

reddish dorsal spots faintly dark bordered (). rhombomaculatna. 

(Xix. Scales in 25 rows. 

Seven labials; robust; light brown with a median dorsal, and two lateral 

rows of dark brown spots faintly dark bordered <). mlligaster. 

The distribution of these species is as follows: The 0. f/ctulus has 
nearly the same Eastern range, not reaching so far north by 10"^, and 
covers the Sonoran and Pacific regions besides, but is scarcely found 
in continental Mexico. Tlie 0. pyrrhomehis inhabits the Sonoran and 
southern part of the Pacific regions. The 0. rho))ibomacuJat us occnines 
the middle regions east of the Appalachian Mountains, and the O.calli- 
gaster the corresponding region west of those mountains, and extends 
west as far as the Pecos Eiver of Texas.

Tins species was for a long time rare in our museums, but recently a 
good many specimens have been taken, especially from the neighbor- 
hood of Washington, District of Columbia. Its range is from Georgia 
to the Potomac Eiver, so far as known. Two, and probably three, speci- 
mens have been recently taken on the Virginia side of that river; one 
near Alexandria, and one near Munson's Hill by Dr. A. K, Fisher. Dr. 
Fisher showed me his specimens, which belongs to the Museum of the 
United States Department of Agriculture, in a fresh state. It did not 
exhibit the bright salmon red of the belly described and figured by 
Holbrook, but was of a cream color with large pale reddish spots. 

The affinities of this species to the Osceola doliata are not close, on 
account of the wide difference in penial characters. The color pattern 
and shades are quite different, but a^iart from this the external dis- 
tinctive features are few. The uniform presence of three temporals in 
the second row is contrasted with the usual occurrence of but two in 
the 0. doliata. The penial structure allies it to the Ojyhiholus calligaster 
and is widely different from that of the Osceola doliata.

This specie.s is quite constant in its characters, but a few variations 
occur. Thus there is but one temporal of the first row, and the loreal is 
fused with the pot^tnasal on both sides in Cat. No. 15329. In Cat. No. 1G294: 
there are twenty-three rows of scales. Cat. No. 17444, a young individual, 
presents many anomalies. There is but one nasal plate on both sides, 
and on one side there is a second loreal above the normal one. The 
first and second superior labials are fused on one side, and all the supe- 
rior labials posterior to the fourth on both sides. The inferior tempo- 
rals of two rows are fused on one side, and there is but one above it in 
the second row, so that the formula is 2-2. Other specimens of the 
same size are entirely normal.

Head rather elongate, little distinct, rather tiat. l^ostral plate little 
prominent; frontal wide anteriorly, narrowed posteriorly; parietals 
short, equaling frontal plate. Loreal longer than high; oculars 1-2, 
the post oculars equal. Temporals, 2-3-3. Superior labials seven, not 
much elevated, higher than long except first and sevenlh. Eye over 
third and fourth. Inferior labials nine, fifth largest. Postgeneials not 
quite as long as progeneials. 

Scales rather wide, in twenty-five longitudinal rowsj the first a little 
larger than the others. Tail short. 

Light olivaceous-brown or gray, with a dorsal series of about sixty 
sub(iuadrangular, emarginate, dark chestnut-brown blotches from head 
to tip of tail, and two smaller lateral series on each side The dorsal 
spots cover ten rows of scales transversely, and three longitudinally on 
the anterior ])art of the body, and two on the posterior part. Their 
anterior and posterior bordeis are more or less concave. Their border 
is very narrowly darker colored with interruptions, and the ground 
color is lighter next to them. The first row of lateral spots does not 
reach the gastrosteges, and covers three to four scales vertically and 
two scales anteroposteriorly. They alternate Mith the dorsals. The 
inferior row alternates with those last described, and the spots are

smaller, covering a scale of tlie inferior row and part of the end of the 
adjacent gastrosteges. The belly is light yellowish, tessellated with 
square brown spots of various sizes. These become obscure in large 

and old specimens. Two 
parallel brown bars on 
the nape diverge as they 
reach the parietal plates, 
and receive between them 
the apex of a lenticular 
brown spot which ex- 
tends forward to the mid- 
dle of the frontal. A 
cross band of brown oc- 
cujiies the posterior half 
of the prefrontal plates. 
A brown band from the 
eye to the angle of the 
mouth crosses the supe- 
rior parts of the last 
three superior labials. 
In large and old specimens these head markings become obsolete. In 
specimens where the median frontoparietal spot is distinct, it embraces 
a narrow median spot of the ground color.

This handsome species ranges the Mississippi Valley, at no great 
distance on either side of the river, from Wisconsin to Texas, and it 
extends throughout northern Texas almost to the Pecos. It was origi- 
nally described by Say, but remained unknown to other American nat- 
uralists until its rediscovery by Kennicott thirty-live years later.

Scales iu tweiity-tlireelongitudiiuil rows; tail five and oiie-balf times 
in total length. Fifty to flfty-eiglit black annuli on an ocbraceous white 
ground on the body; each anteriorly completely, posteriorly more or 

less incompletely, split 
by a vermilion annulus, 
all extending with irregu- 
larities on the belly. 

Head quite distinct 
from body; muzzle con- 
tracted. Frontal plate 
broad, with prolonged 
apex; parietals elongate, 
emarginate behind; equal 
in length to the frontal 
and half the prefrontal. 
Temporals 2-3-4 on one or

half the length of the pre-

rather broad, outer series 
not abruptly enlarged. 
In one specimen all the 
black annuli to the middle of the tail are divided by the red, thus leaving 
the black as a margin to it; hence the number of these annuli is fewer. 
They ai'e four scales wide behind the middle of the body. In another 
specimen only four anterior rings are completely divided, those on the 
following third of the length being divided by red on the sides; the 
remaining annuli black, three scales wide; white annuli one and one- 
half scales; anterior, or nuchal, red annulus widest, its anterior black 
margin attaining parietals; an ochraceous band from gular region, not 
quite completed across parietals. Muzzle, prefrontal plates, and labial 
margin ochraceous; remainder of top and sides of head black.

This species has a longer body than the known red-ringed species, 
and is, indeed, most closelj^ related to the O. hoylii. It will always be 
distinguished from the latter by the jnuch more numerous annuli 
(twenty-eight in hoylii).

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



This species occupies a position between the Osceola doliata and 
Ophiholu.s getulus hoylii. It is, in fact, an Ophiholus getulus hoylii of slen- 
der form and reduced size, in which the black spaces between the white 
rings are more or less split by red. This division, when complete, gives 
the snake the appearance of the Osceola doliata occiiHtalis, and, to a 
somewhat less degree, of the 0. d. coccinea. Such are specimens Cat. 
Nos. 8174, 4292, 10200. When the black is complete just at the middle 
line of the back, we have a form like 0. d. gentilis, as Cat. No. 8435. 
In Cat. Nos. 7845, 11753, 13571 the red only appears on the anterior part 
of the body, and divides completely only a limited number of black 
rings behind the head. These approach nearest the Ophiholus g. hoylii. 
The species further varies in the extent to which the black of the front 
covers the muzzle. The latter is white to the posterior part of the pre- 
frontal scuta in Cat. Nos. 7845, 8174, 10200; it is speckled at the end and 
on the sides in Cat. Nos. 8435, 4292, and it is totally black in Cat. Nos. 
11753, 13571. The yellow half collar crosses the posterior parts of the 
parietal plates in this species, advancing farther forward than in any 
of the subspecies of Osceola doliata excepting the 0. d. occipitalis. 

The increased number of scales on the body and on the temporal 
region indicate that the affinities of this species are stronger with the 
Ophiholus hoylii than with the Osceola doliata. It inhabits a hotter 
and a dryer region than the 0. hoylii, and as the conditions of the 
country are of later geologic origin than are those of California, the 
habitat of the 0. hoylii, we may conclude that it is a descendant of 
the latter. It appears in the dry southern part of California. It illus- 
trates how, under a semitropical sun, a brilliant color makes its appear- 
ance little by little, and probably in a way totally different from that 
in which it appeared in the case of the Osceola doliata coccinea. (See 
that species.)

Lampropeltia multistrata Kennicott, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 18B0, p. 328. 

Dorsal scales in tweuty-three rows. Form similar to that of (hrt'ohi 
gentilis, but the head and eye larger. Color above browuish red, with 
thirty-one pairs of narrow black half rings inclosing white spaces from 
head to anus, the black rings not extending across the abdomen, 
which is uniform yellowish white. Head black above. 

Snout broader and more depressed than in Osceola genfilifi. It is also 
more elongate, and hence, also, the loreal and nasal plates; in the only 
specimen examined, the second superior labial plate is replaced by two 
smaller ones, thus increasing the number to eight, a peculiarity probably 
abnormal, as all the other species of 
the genus have seven. The body 
above is brownish red in spirits, 
crossed by thirty-one pairs of black 
rings from head to anus. The in- 
closed white spaces are one and a half 
scales wide on the central fifteen dor- 
sal rows, and begin to widen abruptly 
an the fourth lateral row on each side, 
extending over three or four scales 
longitudinally on the first row. On 
the sides they are punctulated with 
black, as in Osceola (jentiUs. The oc- 
cipital white ring is much broader. 

The black rings are each two scales wide on the vertebral region, narrow- 
ing to loss than one scale laterally. On the fourth lateral row the two 
rings of each pair begin to diverge, the anterior uniting on the edge of the 
abdomen with the posterior ring of the pair in advance, the posterior 
becoming confluent with the anterior of the succeeding pair. Thus the 
ground color is inclosed in the form of a transverse elliptical spot. Upon 
the middle of the body these spots are two or three scales wide on the 
vertebral region, four or five on the sides, and but one on the first row 
of scales. Anteriorly the red intervals are greater; posteriorly they 
narrow slightly, but toward the tip of the tail they are entirely lost, as 
in Osceola doliata and goititis, by the confluence of the black rings. 
The black rings extend but a short distance upon the abdominal scuta, 
leaving the abdomen destitute of blotches, though it is faintly and 
sparsely punctulated. The chin and inferior labials are tinged with 
brown. The top of the head is black, as in Osceola gentilis.

The number of rows of body and temporal scales and the more numer- 
ous rings will distinguish this species from Osceola doliata., and those 
above compared with it. From the Ophibolus pyrrhomelas it differs in 
the eight superior labial plates.

Head little distinct, conical, not depressed, the muzzle slightly com- 
pressed and the rostral plate projecting beyond the lower jaw. Ros- 
tral plate moderately recurved on the superior face of the muzzle. Fron- 
tal rather wide, produced posteriorly. Loreal small; oculars 1-2. The 
eye not large, resting on the third and fourth superior labials. Tem- 
poral scales 2-3-4. Superior labials seem higher than long, except the 
first, sixth, and seventh. Inferior labials ten, fifth largest ; jjostgeneials 
shorter than pregeneials. Scales in from twenty-one to twenty-five 
rows, rather short, the sizes graduating insensibly. Tail short. 

(Iround color black, marked above and below with yellow or white 
spots and bauds, the latter generally transverse, rarely longitudinal. 
Labial plates light colored, with d^rk borders. Top of head black, with 
larger or smaller white or yellow spots. 

This species ranges the entire Nearctic Realm, as far north as about 
latitude 40°. It is not found in the Neotropical Realm, unless the 
Lower Californian district be embraced in it. 

The variability of this species is in some i-espects considerable, while 
in others it is quite constant. A number of distinct species have been 
proposed on its forms, most of which I felt compelled to reduce to this 
one as subspecies at the time of writing my Check-list in 1875. Fur- 
ther reduction is made now. The number of rows of scales is not 
constant. In the subspecies 0. g. getulus they may be twenty-one or 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 911 

twenty -three; and in the O.y. hoylii they may number twenty- three or 
twenty- five. The cliaracters based on color indicate natural ideograph- 
ical subspecies, but the transitions from one to the other are not lack- 
ing. The subspecies are defined as follows : 

1. Scales iu 21 to2;irows. 

Scales with yellow centers, sometimes collected iuto cross bands ou the buck; 
head yellow-spotted above O.g. sayi. 

Narrow, white, dorsal cross bands, bifurcating on the flanks to embrace alter- 
nating black areas; head white-spotted above; or uniform black above; below 
with white spots ; head spots few O.g. gefulus. 

2. Scales in 23 to 25 rows. 

Scales of the sides with yellow or white centers; median dorsal region l)lack, 
with cross bands of scales with yellow centers ; top of head, except muzzle, 
black O.g. splendidua. 

Elack with complete white annuli, which are wider on the sides than on the 
back ; top of head black, of mnzzle white O.g. hoijlii. 

Black, with more or less numerous longitudinal stripes above and on the sides; 
parts of annuli present or absent; top of head black; top of muzzle Avhite. 

O. g. California. 

The geographical distribution of these subspecies is well defined. 
Thus the O.g. sayi belongs to the Austrorii^arian region west of the 
Allegheny Mountains, and of the central region north to latitude 42°. 
The 0. g. (jre^MZw,? occupies the Austroripariau and Eastern regions north 
to about latitude 42°. The 0. g. splendidus is the type of the Sonoran 
. district, and the 0. g. hoylii of the Pacific. The 0. g. californiw proba- 
bly comes from the Lower Californian, but our specimens came from 
the southern part of the Pacific region. 

This is the largest species of the genus, and is beautiful in all its 
forms. It is thoroughly harmless to mankind and can be handled to 
any extent M'ithout showing fear or anger.

ficulty capable of being extended after immersion in alcohol. Yertical 
plate triangular, wider than long; outer edge slightly convex, an angle 
being faintly indicated at the Junction of the superciliaries and occip- 
itals; sliorter tiian the occipitals, which are short, longer than broad. 
Postfrontals large, broad; anterior smaller. Rostral small, not pro-

about as liigh as the labial below it; center of the eye a little anterior 
to the middle of the commissure, over the junction of the third and 
fourth labials. One anteorbital, vertically quadrate; loreal half its 
height, square. Upper labials seven, increasing to the penultimate. 
Lower labials nine; fourth and fifth largest. 

Scales nearly as high as long, hexagonal, truncated at each end. 
Dorsal rows twenty one, exterior rather larger, and diminishing almost 
imperceptibly to the back, although all the scales in a single oblique 
row are of very nearly the same shape and size. 

The scales on the back and sides are lustrous black, each one with a 
central elliptical or subcircular spot of ivory white, which on the sides 
occupy nearly the whole of the scale, but are smaller toward the back,

where they involve one-half to one-third of the length. Beneath yel- 
lowish white, with broad distinct blotches of black, more numerous 
posteriorly. Skin between the scales brown. The plates on the top 
and sides of the head have each a yellowish blotch ; the labials are yel- 
low, with black at their junction. 

Other specimens agree except in having bright yellow instead of 
white as described; the spots, too, are rather smaller, and manifest a 
slight tendency to aggregation on adjacent scales, so as to form trans- 
verse bands. This is seen more decidedly where the back is crossed 
by about seventy short dotted yellow lines ; the fifty-sixth opposite the 
anus. The scales between have very obsolete spots of lighter, scarcely 
discernible. The sides are yellow, with black spots corresponding to 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES.

the dorsal lines; indeed, there may be indistinctly discerned two or 
tbree lateral series of alternating- blotches. 

Ill larger specimens Irom the West, this tendency in the spots to 
aggregation is still more distinct. The back is crossed by these dotted 
lines of the number and relation indicated, at intervals of four or five 
scales; the spots on the intervening space being obsolete. These lines 
bifurcate at about the ninth outer row, the branches connecting with 
those contiguous, so as to form hexagons, and these extending toward 
the abdomen again, decussate on about the third outer row, thus inclos- 
ing two series of square dark spots on each side. These lateral mark- 
ings are, however, not very discernible, owing to the confusion produced 
by the greater number of yellow spots. On the edge of the abdomen 
are dark blotches, one opposite each dorsal dark space, the centers of 
the scutelhe being likewise blotched, but so as rather to alternate with 
those just mentioned. 

Specimens from Indianola exhibit all varieties of coloration.

Newberu, North Carolina. 

Cat. No. 8077, U.S.N.M. 

Black, crossed by about thirty narrow, contiuuous yellow lines, wliicli 
bifur(;ate on the flanks, the very obtuse angles embracing on each side 
a series of very much elongated patches, and iu fact, by the union of 
the branches with each other, dividing the back into a succession of 
large black hexagons. 

Very similar in. general relations to 0. sayi, although the body 
appears rather stouter, and the head and eyes somewhat larger iu pro 
portion. The color above is deep lustrous black, crossed by about 
thirty-three continuous yellow lines, the twenty-sixth opposite the 
anus. These lines, which on the middle of the back are narrow, one- 
half or one scale in width, widen rapidly till they meet the lateral 
series of black blotches, when they extend longitudinally in either

direction, and anastomose with their fellows. On each side, and alter- 
nating witli the (lark inclosures on the back, is a series of deep black 
blotches, extendiuii' from the abdomen (where those of opposite sides 
are generally continent) over the first and second outer rows of scales. 
These blotches are rounded above, five or six s(;ales long, and sepa- 
rated from the nearest dark part of the back by one or one-half scale. 
The outer edge of the abdomen and the exterior dorsal rows between 
these blotches being yellow causes the chain pattern to be continuous, 
inclosing a series of elongated dorsal spots from seven to ten scales 
long and about seventeen wide. Center of abdomen largely blotched 
with black, usually confluent with the blotches already mentioned. 
The plates on the head are black, with yellow si)ots. 

The pattern as here described is subject to some irregularities, the 
chain being sometimes broken, and the lines oblique, not transverse, 
and the dark blotches of opposite sides not truly opposite to each 
other.

In his pamphlet on the Serpents of New York (Albany, 1854), Pro- 
fessor Baird remarks that this species is quite maritime in its northern 
distribution, being rarely found in the Northern States excepting near 
the coast. It is occasionally seen in Long Island, New York, accordiug 
to DeKay, aud more frequently in eastern New Jersey. It is not cited 
by Dr. J. A, Allen in his Catalogue of the Keptiles and Batrachiaus 
found in the vicinity of Springfield, Massachusetts,' nor is it included 
in the list of species found in the State which is included in the paper. 
In its western distribution it is not known from west of the Mississippi 
River. 

This form is said to be an enemy aud devourer of other snakes, espe- 
cially of the venomous Crotalidas. I have not personally met with a 
case of it. It is entirely inoffensive to man, making no hostile demon- 
strations. My daughter, when a girl of six or eight years, had several 
individuals as pets. They drank milk readily from a cuj) which she 
held in her hand. 

Prof. O. P. Hay^ says: 

It is extremely active and strong. Holbrook says of it that it is found abundantly 
in moist and shady places, although it never takes to -water or trees. It feeds on 
moles, small birds, or such reptiles as lizards, salamanders, toads, and the like, that 
fall in its way. He further says that it is commonly believed that it is the great 
enemy of the rattlesnake, but there is no great evidence of this. He, however, tells 
of one that had as a fellow-prisoner a Crofalophorns niilarius, or Southern ground 
rattle.snake, and swallowed him. I found that in Mississippi this snake had the 
rei)utation of destroying rattlesnakes, and it received protection on this account. 
Dr. Elliott Cones * says that the black snake (Zamenis constrictor) and Ophibolus 
getulus sayi wage a constant warfare against rattlesnakes and moccasins. They are 
said to be uniformly victorious and to eat their victims. It is on account of their 
prowess in thus destroying poisonous serpents that they have received the name 
of king snake. Mr. J. T. Humphreys, Burke County, North Carolina, gives' an 
interesting account of a conflict in a cage between a king snake, sai/i, aud a water 
moccasin. The former was 42 inches long, the latter 34, but with a considerably

larger body. Tlie moccasin w:is killed, its l>oiic8 crushed, aud, hcyitiuiiig at. tlie 
head, the king snake swallowed 16 inches of tlie moccasin's body. Clilorolorm 
was then administered and both snakes preserved. The king snake had previously, 
while in captivity, eaten seven snakes. Dr. Yarrow ' describes a specimen of 
fietulun in the National Musenm that has two perfect heads. One bead is a little 
larger than the other. The two gnllets nnite to pass into th^ one stomacb. 

The following- is Yarrow's description of the black form of this sub- 
species called by him Ophiholiis (jetulus niger: 

Color entirely black, with the exception of the under part of the head ; upper and 
lower labial marked like the typical O.geiulus tjetnliis. Head plates entirely black, 
not spotted, and in one of the specimens 
examined light central spots on the head 
scales are to be seen. Frontals, parietals, 
and superciliaries more elongated and 
narrower than in the normal tyjie; fron- 
tals aud prefrontals about the same. 
Abdominal scutelke plumbeous, white 
spotted, not yellow. A peculiarity of 
the type specimens from which tbis de- 
scription is prepared is that the third, 
fourth, and iifth postabdominal scutella; 
are entire, not divided ; but this last trait 
has been noticed in other species of the 
genus. In the specimen described, on the 
second, and third row of scales are a few 
sparsely scattered white spots resembling 

those of O.geiulus sai/i, but there is no approach to regularity, nor is there any indi- 
cation of a pattern. Seven upper labials on both sides; nine lower on one, ten on 
the other; twenty-one rows of scales, one anteorbital, two postorbitals. Length, 4 
feet 6 inches. 

A younger specimen, 3 feet 4 inches long, is similar in appearance to the older one, 
but there seems to be a tendency to a greater display of the white spots on the 
sides. Color of tbe back, lustrous black; belly dull black, with milk-white macu- 
lations. Isolated and minutely punctulated spots on the back show a decided ap- 
proach to a pattern of coloration as in O.g. getuhis.

varieties of 0. g. smji and 0. g. getulus. There is a series of dorsal black 
blotches from head to tail; in one specimen sixty-three, the forty-ninth 
opposite the anus; in the other, fifty-two, the forty-first opposite the 
anus. These are four or five scales long and six or seven wide. The 
lighter intervals between are constituted by one or two transverse rows 
of spots, each one on a separate scale. The scales on the sides (from 
the first to the seventh or eighth rows) are black, each one with an 
elongated white blotch in the center. These blotches occupy nearly 
the whole scale on the exterior row, but diminish in amount toward 
the back. A series of rhomboidal darker spots is seen on each side 
opposite the light intervals, produced by the less amount of white on 
the scales at that place, and sometimes extend to the abdomen. The

abdomen is white, blotclied not very deeply with black two or three 
scales wide, and a continnation of the dark shade in the prolongation 
of the lateral rhomboids. The blotches of the opposite sides are some- 
times confluent and sometimes alternate. In one specimen the black 
patches are rather wider, extending nearly to the abdomen. Head less 
blotched with yellow than 0. (/'hoylii. Differs from O. g. boylii in having 
the light intervals in the form of spots in the centers of dark scales, 
instead of covering the whoUi space. The lateral blotches are alternate 
with those of the back, not continuous and opposite. The blotches are 
more numerous.

seven scales on tlie outer row. They continue of this width to the 
middle of the abdomen, where they are either confluent with the white 
of the opposite side, or are opposite to the black interval on the other 
side. The black interval between the cross bands is some eight to ten 
scales long, narrowing on the sides as the white spaces enlarge, until 
on the outer dorsal rows it occupies them to four scales, and is contin- 
ued to the middle of the abdomen; owing to a slight obliquity of the 
dark patches on the back their abdominal extensions are very apt to 
alternate with each other on the middle of the abdomen, instead of 
being directly opposite and confluent. Every transition from the one

is much obscured, and si sliglit approximation to the subspecies splen- 
diduH is presented. According to Van Denburgh the young can not be 
distinguished from that of 0. g. boylii. On tlie other hand, the type 
called by Yarro^v mKlUcinrfiis has the white cross bands more numerous 
than in the tyi)ical L. g. boylii. 

This handsome form inhabits regions of diverse climate, ranging 
from the comparatively rainy region of northern California to the dry 
southern extremity of Lower California and the arid deserts of south- 
ern Arizona and southern Nevada. It has not been taken east of 
Arizona. The form conjunctKH is from the southern extremity of Lower 
California, while the multicincfus type is from southern California. 

Dr. Merriam, in his report on the Death Valley Expedition, gives the 
following note in regard to the distribution of this species: 

This lar^e and conspicuons snake, whose cream-colored body is sharply marked 
by rings of black, was lirst found in the valley of the Lower Muddy, near an aban- 
doned mill at Overton, Nevada, where several were secui'cd in dense thickets of 
Airiplex torreyi. About dark they began to emerge from these retreats, making a 
great noise in crawling over the dry leaves, and were soon found in the open. The 
species was obtained also in Pahranagat Valley, Nevada, a little north of the 
middle of the valley. On the west slope of the Sierra Nevada, in California, speci- 
mens were collected in Kern Valley, at Three Rivers, and on the east fork of Kaweah 
River.

Plates of the head similar to those of 0. getulus hoyli : One anteor- 
bital, three postorbitals, seven upper labials, ten lower labials, twenty- 
three rows of scales on body; difference, so far as the head is concerned, 
being an increase in number of postorbitals and lower labials. 

Color markedly different 
from the type of 0. gctulus 
hoyli. The first white an- 
nulus, three scales wide, 
begins eleven scales posteri- 
orly to the parietals. There 
is then an interval of five 
scales to the third white 
annulus, which, instead of 
passing down toward the 
abdomen, expands at the 
base and joins an oval ring 
eight scales wide trans- 
versely to the body and 
eight scales long posteriorly. Eight scales behind this ring a longitu- 
dinal white line one and one-half scales wide commences, which extends 
the length of body to opposite the two hundred and seventh abdominal 
scute, or about the thirtieth from the anus. This line is absolutely 
continuous, but breaks off into annuli at the place mentioned. There 
are then a triangular white blotch, three annuli, another blotch, and

tances of four and seven scales l)elo\v this doi'sal line, on both sides, are 
indications of lines, which are nearly comi)lete in one of the specimens; 
in others they are broken into whitish blotches longitudinally arranged. 
Color of head and upper part of body pitchy, kistrous black; middle,

This subspecies presents a very different facies from the 0. getulus 
hoyUi. The head and neck resemble O. (j. hnyVtiux markings and coloia- 
tioD, but the appearance of the body and tail is entirely different.

The transition between this form and the O. g. boyUi is accomplished 
by specimens Cat. Nos. 11747-87. In these the crossbands are numer- 
ous; in the former there are four on the anterior part of the body and 
seven on the posterior part anterior to the tail, the latter being also 
crossbanded. In Cat. No. 11787 a longitudinal median stripe extends 
through much of the length, but the sides have vertical blotches rep- 
resenting the corresponding crossbands on the 0. //. hoyUi. 

In De Blainville's type of this species there are no transverse bands, 
and the lateral stripes are but little interrupted. The dorsal stripe is, 
on the other hand, interrupted at several points. 

In a specimen without locality in the T". S. National Museum, the 
body and tail are black above and yellowish-white below. A pure 
white stripe runs on the vertebral line from the nape to the end of the 
tail, and another on the first and second rows of scales on the anterior 
four-tifths of the length. ^Mr. Van Denburgh describes a specimen from 
Cape St. T.ucas which is black above and below, including the head, 
except a cinnamon-colored vertebral stripe and some cinnamon-colored 
spots on the nape and on the superior aspect of the tail, where the 
stripe is wanting. ,

Slilosoma Brown, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. IMiihi., 1890, p. 199. — Cope, Proc. U. S. 
Nat. Mns., XIV, 1892, p. 595. 

Body slender, cyliudrical; tail short; bead not distinct from body. 
Eostral prominent, but not recnrved ; no prefrontals or loreals. One 
nasal. Scales smooth. No scale pits. Anal entire. Teeth smooth. 

This genus is probably a degraded ally of Ophibolus. Dr. Stejneger 
suggested an afiinity to that genus, and my examination of the penial 
structure confirms this view. It is interesting to find the only species 
in Florida, where occurs also the Osceola elapsoideaj the most reduced 
form of its genus.

Ground color silvery-gray, with sixty-one dorsal spots of dark brown 
with blackish border, from head to anus, and eleven on the tail. Ante- 
riorly the spots are from two to four scales long and from five to seven 
wide, posteriorly becoming smaller. The interspaces are about equal 
in length to two spots and have the three median rows of scales mot- 
tled with pale red. Under surface of body silvery-gray, much blotched 
with black, which runs up on the three exterior rows of scales, opposite 
the intervals between the dorsal spots. On the sides each light scale 
is finely punctuated with black. An elongated triangular dark patch 
on the parietals pointing backward, and a small dark blotch just 
below it on each side of the neck. A dark bar running back from the

Measurements. — Total leugth of specimen, 5;}2 mm. (21 iuches); length 
of tail, 50 mm. (2 iuches). 

Dr. Stejneger^ remarks on this subject as follows: 

The type specimen oH Stilosoma extenuatiun is described as possessing no separute 
l)refrontiils (these being fnsed with the interuasals), uo loreal, and no preocnhirs. 
The large interuasals join the sapralabials and enter the eye, and the parietals join 
the su^jralabials behind the postoculars, excluding the temporals from the latter. 

The three additional specimens seem to prove that the ouly normal and stable 
cliaracters among the above are the absence of the loreal and the joining of the 
parietals and supralabials. The absence of the preocular is only found in +ho tyy)e, 
while the fusion of the interuasals with the prefrontals is found iu the type and in 
one of the Orange County specimens as well, but not iu the other two, in which 
they are normally separated.

928 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

The typical specimen still continues to be tlie only one known. 

This species so much resembles the Gontia mitis as to lead to the sus- 
picion that its generic i^eculiarities are abnormalities of the head scuta. 
The relations of the loreal plate are, however, symmetiical, and the 
frontal plate is wider than in the C. mitis. The coloration is identical 
in alcohol. The head is relatively shorter; and to this fact are to be 
ascribed its tegumental peculiarities. It is in any case a type of recent 
origin.

longer than the vertical. Tostlront^ls large; prefrontals much smaller. 
Koslral projecting fcn-ward, acute, causing the snout to be pointed, not 
recurved nor compressed into a ridge as in Heterodon. Eye small, its 
center over the third labial, and over the middle of the commissure. 
Postorbitals two; anteorbital one. The sui)erciliaries are very small 
and narrow, in one specimen looking like an upper i)ostorbital. One 
line of temi)oral shields. Loreal small. One nasal; nostril situated in 
its center, with a rounded groove to the lower edge, sonietimes to the 
upper, apparently separating two nasals. Upper labials six, the third 
constituting the greater portion of the orbit below, with the lower post- 
orbital resting upon it and on the second; all the labials nearly equal 
in size, fourth and tifth largest. Lower labials eight, fifth largest. 

The back and sides are embraced by about twenty elongated longitu- 
dinal black rings (the sixteenth opposite the anus), their anterior and 
posterior sides on the dorsal line, their lateral resting on the outer dor- 
sal row. Across the back the black is well defined and continuous, 
about two scales long; on the 
sides, however (from the first 
to the third rows), the black 
is interrui)ted more or less, 
sometimes reduced to a few 
scattered scales. The inter- 
vals between the successive 
rings are yelloAv, with the cen- 
ters of the scales dusky (they 
sometimes have only a narrow 
margin of yellowish), and on 
the sides may be seen a dis- 
tinct rhomboidal black spot 

opposite each dorsal light interval. This is sometimes broken up and 
confused with the black of the rings on the sides. The large spaces 
inclosed by the rings themselves are yellowish red (said to be crimson 
in life), six to nine scales long, and about thirteen wide; they are vari- 
able in length, being larger at about the anterior third than elsewhere. 
Beneath uniform yellowish white. The first ring crosses just behind 
the occipital plates, and in front of it is a narrow black band crossing 
the middle of the occipitals, from one angle of the mouth to the other, 
sometimes connected with the lirst ring by a narrow black line. Rest 
of the head yellowish. Another specimen has twenty-six rings, the 
twentieth opposite the anus. 

A specimen from Prairie Mer Ilouge has the whole lower wall of the 
orbit constituted by the third labial, with both anterior and i)osterior 
orbitals resting upon it. The vertical is more elongated. The anterior 
dorsal ring, instead of being continucms, is divided anteriorly, and the

men from the same locality tlie thir^ labial only enters the eye on one 
side, and the second and third on the other, in the nsual way. 

In this species the loreal plate makes various approaches to the bor- 
der of the orbit, in some instances entering it, according to Professor 
Jan, who figures it in a specimen from Tennessee. He regards the 
character as indicating a species which he calls Cemophora copei; but 
in a Floridian specimen the character is so intermediate as to show that 
it has no systematic value. 

The Cemophora coccinea is a species of the Austroriparian region, but 
it has not been found in the Texan district, nor does it ascend the 
Mississippi River as far as the region extends. It is especially abun- 
dant in Florida.

tion of the fourth and fifth upper labials, about opposite the middle of 
the commissure. Postorbitals two, lower in notch between the lifth 
and sixth labials, although resting more on tlie latter. Anteorbital 
large, resting on the fourth labial, the fourth and fifth labials oonstitut- 
iug equally the inferior part of the orbit. Loreal elongated, horizontal, 
trapezoidal; well developed. Nasals apparently double, perhaps a sin- 
gle one verj' much excavated. Two temporal shields between the occip- 
itals and labials. Labials eight above, seventh largest; eight below, 
tiftli largest. Dorsal rows of scales twenty-three, all perfectly smooth ; 
scales rhomboidal, nearly equal, but rather narrow above. Abdominal 
scutelUe two hundred and six; posterior one entire. Subcaudal scu- 
telhc forty, all entire. 

The body is crossed by about thirty-three quadrate black blotches, 
the twenty- seventh opposite the anus. These are nearly of the same 
length, and of the same distance apart throughout, four scales long, 
and extending between the second external rows, where their sides are 
rather rounded or angulated. The black is very deep and continuous

on the four or five central rows of scales, whence to the flanks it is 
varied by having the centers of each scale reddish yellow. The inter- 
vals between the blotches are exactly the reverse; above they are uni- 
form pale red, and on the sides the centers of each scale are black. 
Sometimes scattered black scales may be observed on the back in the 
light spaces. Beneath yellowish white, unspotted. The two outer 
rows of scales of the same color, but with a short black bar extending 
from the middle of each light and each dark space, perpendicularly to 
the abdomen, the extreme edge of which is sometimes involved. The 
head and half its length behind are black, spotted with yellowish on 
the sides. The snout and labials yellowish, the plates margined with 
black.

This species displays remarkable variations in coloration. In Cat. No. 
5168 the large blotches are perfectly distinct, and their lateral inter- 
spaces have but faint traces of markings. In Cat. Nos. 20i:u, 2()2o, 20.')0, 
2031, 11743, 11784, all of small size, and Cat. No. 2010, fully grown, there 
is a vertical black spot between the dorsal blotches on each side. In 
Cat. Nos. 8370, 4471, 4472 the entire space on the sides between the dorsal 
blotches is marked with a black spot ou the center of each scale. Cat. 
Nos. 8021 and 8022 are more like the first noted variety, but carry the 
peculiarity further. The dorsal blotches are perfectly distinct from 
each other and are truncate, and not narrowed at their inferior border. 
Very few of the scales have light centers, and there are no intermediate 
lateral spots. Belly spots sparse. In Cat. No. 8022 a wide longitudinal 
median black band forms, with the occipital spot, an anchor-shaped 
figure. This variety is approached nearly by the second and only other 
species of the genus, the R. antonii Duges, which has the black cross 
bands fewer in number and wider. It is from Mazatlan. Individuals 
also ditfer in the relative size of the loreal plate and number of cross- 
bars. In one from the Canadian River there are thirty seven rings; 
in one from the Llano Estacado twenty six. In another from the same 
locality the abdomen is black, tessellated; in all others, white. 

The range of the Rh'mochUus lecontei is throughout the Sonoran dis- 
trict. The most eastern and northern locality known for it is G-arden 
City, in southwestern Kansas, where Professor Cragin, of Topeka, 
obtained a specimen. It presents the anomaly of having the loreal 
plate to enter the orbit below the preocular. 

Mr. S. W. Garman' names a "var. tessellatus,^^ with the sole descrip- 
tion: "Labials, eight. Infralabials, ten. Ventrals, one hundred and 
seventy-eight. Subcaudals, thirty-seven entire, plus fourteen pair.''

urosteges divided ; pupil round; prefrontals in contact; labials distinct 
from nasal. 

In this genus we have a reduction of the cephalic pholidosis in a 
type which has its extreme representative in the burrowing genus 
Ficimia. It stands in general features allied to some of the species of 
Chionactis, as the C. episcopus, and Boulenger unites it with his partly 
synonymous Contia. Chionactis has internasal plates, while they are 
absent in Conopsis, with anomalous exceptions. In Contia there are 
no grooved teeth. But one species of Conopsis is known.

Seven subcephalic plates. No internasals. Loreal generally present. 
Upper surface of body olivaceous, spotted toward the front with black. 

Head slightly convex in the prefrontal region. Rostral a little 
depressed and pointed at the extremity to form an angle when viewed 
in profile, but rounded transversely. Two well-developed prefrontals. 
Frontal hexagonal, longer than wide, having an obtuse angle in front 
and an acute one behind. The parietals rather wide, and relatively 
short. Seven supralabials, the third and fourth outlining the inferior 
border of the ocular disk. Nasal pierced in the middle and not in con- 
tact with the preocular, where the loreal is wanting or reaching it by an 
angle only. Loreal square. One preocular, two postoculars. Three 
temporals, the first a little larger than the two following. Two pairs 
of geneials, the second much shorter than the first, and separated from 
each other by a scutella. Six inferior labials, the first four in contact 
with the anterior geneial. Four or five pairs of gular scales, followed 
by 110-134 gastrosteges, of which the first two or three are rather nar- 
row. Tail a little longer in the males than in the females, having on 
the under side 29-38 urosteges. Trunk scales convex behind, arranged 
in 17 median longitudinal series. 

Measurements. — Total length of a male specimen, 206 mm.; length 
from the end of muzzle to anus, 217 mm. ; length of tail, 40 mm. 

Upper surfaces of the body olive yellow, spotted with small angular 
black marks, which are arranged in indistinct longitudinal lines. 
Below the eye, on the fourth supralabial, there is sometimes a black- 
ish spot. The lower surfaces are yellowish white, with gray dots at 
the right and left of the ventrals and caudals. 

This species is subject to variations consisting of the fusion or abor- 
tion of plates. The loreal plate is occasionally absent on one or both 



CROCODITJANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 035 

sides, juid rarely the postoculars may be fused, and two superior 
labials may be eijually rarely fused. According to Giiuther and Bou- 
leuger the forms witli interuasal plates are only variations of this 
species, and the form of the rostral may vary from obtusely rounded 
to angulate, and to angulate with concave superior surfaces. That 
this incredible raiige of variations is characteristic of this species is 
sustained by the existence, according to these authors, of two individ- 
uals in the British Museum in which the internasal is present on one 
side and absent on the other. The great majority of specimens are, 
however, according to these authors, constant in these respects. Thus 
Boulenger enumerates thirteen individuals with iuternasals present on 
both sides and sixteen in which they are absent on both sides. Under 
such circumstances the irregularity in question would seem to be 
rather an anomaly than an indication that all the specimens belong to 
one species. This view is confirmed by ten specimens at my disposal 
which come under the definition of Conojjsis nasus as given by Boulen- 
ger. Five, which I refer to the C. nasus, constantly lack iuternasals, 
and five which 1 refer to Toluca Kneata, Chionactis diasii, and Chionactis 
varians, as constantly possess them. All possess loreals except the two 
individuals of Toluca lineata, where the nasal articulates with the pre- 
ocular; and one side of two individuals of Conopsis nasus, where, on 
the contrary, the nasal terminates posteriorly in an acute angle, not 
reaching the x^reocular. 

The small black dorsal spots are obsolete in four of the five specimens 
before me. These were sent me by M. Boucard, of Paris, without 
especial indication of locality. 

Duges gives as habitats of this species the valley of Mexico, Leon, 
Guanajuato, and Zacatecas.

in the presence of internasal plates. The last maxillary tooth is only

very deep. Heuce it has been overlooked by various authors. It is 
this- character which separates it from Contia, to which some of its 
species have been referred. The known species are found in the 
Souoran and Toltecan subregions and in the adjacent parts of the 
Central American region. All are of small size. They differ as 
follows: 

I. Scales in 13 rows. 

Ventrals 126-137; luosteges 37-46; pale brown with faint longitudinal lines. 

C. taylorii Bonlenger. 

II. Scales in 15 rows. 

Gastrosteges 145-153 ; urosteges 35-57 ; pale brown, with or without darker cross- 
bands or faint lines C. episcopus Kennicott. 

Gastrosteges 158; urosteges 34; rosy and white, with single black annulus or 
semiannulus ; a black occipital cresent C. occipitalis Cope. 

Gastrosteges 152-173; urosteges 37-45; red, with pairs of black cross-bands 
inclosing yellow ones C. michuacnnenais Duges. 

III. Scales in 17 rows. 

Occipital plates broad, regularly rounded; rostral prominent, convex above; 
jDregeneials short, in contact with three labials ; belly sjiotted . . C. diasii Cope. 

Occipital plates longer, with undulate and emarginate posterior border; rostral 
concave above; pregeneials longer, in contact with four labials; below un- 
spotted C. varians Jan . 

The shallowness and position of the groove of the last maxillary 
tooth in this genus does not entitle it to be placed in the Ojjisthogly- 
pha. It may be perhaps in a condition from which the true groove of 
the opisthoglyijhous tooth may have arisen. 

CHIONACTIS TAYLORII Boulenger. 

Contia taylorii Boulenger, Cat. Snakes Brit. Mus., 11, 1894, p. 265, pi. xii, fig. 3. 

Rostral broader than deep, the portion visible from above one-half to 
two-thirds as long as the distance from the frontal; nasal undivided; 
suture between the internasals as long as or shorter than that between 
the XJrefrontals ; frontal about once and a half as long as brond, broader 
than the supraocular, longer than its distance from the end of the snout, 
a little shorter tlian the parietals; lorcal small, longer than deep; one 
preocular and two postoculars; temporals 1 -|- 1 or 1 -^- 2; seven upper 
labials, third and fourth entering the eye; three or four lower labials in 
contact with the anterior chin shields; posterior chin shields very small 
and separated from each other. Scales in 13 rows. Ventrals 126-137; 
anal divided; subcaudals 37-46. Pale brown above, each scale darker 
along the center; upper lip and lower i)arts white. 

Measurements. — Total length, 270 mm.; tail, 55 mm. 

Texas, probably the southwest (San Diego, Duval County). 

I have not seen this species, but the small number of scales and gas- 
trosteges indicate its distinctness. Judging from Boulenger's figure, 
it closely resembles the C. episcopus episcopus.

Scales in fifteen rows, all sinootli; superior labials, seven; the orbit 
bounded by the third and more largely by the fourth; loreal, small, 
quadrangular, longer than high; oculars, 1-2 anterior short, covered 
above by superciliary; i:)osto('ulars resting on fourth labial; fifth and 
sixth labials equal, as high as long; parietals, large, long; frontal, 
longer than wide; ])refrontals, transverse. Internasals partly separ- 
ated by rostral, which is not very prominent. Inferior labials, six; 
first pair meeting; fourth largest. Postgeneials extremely short. Tem- 
porals little larger than body scales, 1-2. Muzzle obtuse; head scarcely 
distinct; eye small. Gastrosteges, one hundred and sixty-three; anal 
1-1 ; urosteges varying in Texan specimens from thirty- five to forty- 
five. 

There are three well-marked color varieties, which pass into each 
other. They are as follows: 

Ground color asheu to rosy, with the scales broadly tipped with brown. A few 
only of the median rows of dorsal scales may be red, and the top of the head 
may or may not be brown C.e. episcopus. 

Ground color light yellow tinged with brown above; three median dorsal rows 
orange. Top of head, from anterior border of frontal to near end of occipitals, 
black. A transverse black spot beginning on the fourth scale behind the occipi- 
tals, two scales long and including the fourth row of scales from the gastrosteges 
on each side G.e. torqnatus. 

Ground color is ashy or red. The back is traversed by from nineteen to twenty-one 
black cross-bands of thrc^e .and a half scales in length; there are six on the tail.

These subspecies pass into each other by distinct gradations, although 
the intermediate forms are less abundant than the types. 

This is a characteristic species of western Texas. It is common west 
of Fort Worth to Fort Concho and about Helotes in the south. It 
exhibits a great range of color variation, since it is evident that the C. 
isozoniis must be reckoned as one of its varieties. Thus its range 
extends to Utah ami Arizona.

CHIONACTIS EPISCOPUS EPISCOPUS Kennicott. 

Contia episcopa episcopa Cope, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., No. 17, 1880, p. 21. 
Lamprosoma episcojmm Kenxicott, U. S. Mex. Bound. Surv., II, Reptiles, 1859, p. 

22, pi. VIII, fig. 2. 
Homalosoma ejnscopum Jan, Icon. G6n. Opbid., Pt. 13, pi. iv, fig. 2. 

Form rather stout, tapering very little toward the neck, which is 
not niucli narrower than the head, and moderately tapering toward 
the tail. The tail forms about one-fifth of the total length. Head rather 
depressed; crown flattened iwsteriorly. Snout broad, rounded, and 
depressed. Frontal a third longer than wide ; scarcely tapering behind ; 
acute posteriorly, and usually slightly concave on the sides. Suporcil- 
iaries and parietals short and narrow. iTasal elongated; nostril very 

small in the center of the plate. 
Loreal elongated; not half as 
large as the anteorbital, which is 
itself small and vertically elon- 
gated. Postorbitals of nearly 
equal size. Temporals, 1-2. Ros- 
tral subpentagonal ; the npex 
acute and turned back upon tlie 
crown, entering slightly between 
the prefrontals. Seven upper 
labials; fourth, fifth, and sixth 
largest and nearly equal in size, seventh very small. Lower labials 
seven; the fourth very much the largest. The dorsal scales in fifteen 
rows; they increase regularly in size from the central rows, which are 
much the smallest, to the first lateral row, which is higher than long. 
The color of the entire upper parts of head and body is uniform light 
olive brown tinged with green, but on close inspection each scale is 
seen to be very minutely mottled with black toward the center, and 
upon stretching the skin the base of each scale is black. A rose-colored 
vertebral stripe in life. The abdomen is uniform whitish green. In a 
specimen from Eio Seco the exposed base of each scale is black, giving 
the body somewhat of an indistinctly mottled appearance even when 
the skin is not stretched. The colors become lighter after soaking long 
in alcohol, and the black at the bases of the scales becomes more or 
less effaced. 

Cat. No. 2042; upper labials, 7; rows of scales, 15.

I have also numerous specimens from West Texas from between Fort 
Worth and Fort Concho on the north to San Antonio on the south. 
Twelve of the.se are from the Wichita River and were collected by- 
Jacob Boll. Of these, seven are normal, three have no loreal on one 
side, and one has no loreal on both sides; one has two temporals of the 
anterior row instead of one. A si)ecimen from a more western locality, 
San Angelo, Texas, is anomalous in having no loreals, and in having 
the two postoculars fused into one on both sides. 

CHIONACTIS EPISCOPUS TORQUATUS Cope. 

Contia episcopa torquata CoPE, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., No. 20, 1880, p. 21. 
Contia torquata Boilengeii, Cat. Snakes Brit. Mus., II, 189-1, p. 266. 

Light yellowish brown above, with a median undehned orange band. 
Top of head (rom anterior part of frontal plate to near posterior border 
of parietals black. A black half collar behind the parietal plates 
extending to the third row of scales on each side, exclusive. 

In one specimen the third and fourth rows of scales black at their 
bases, forming a double lateral stripe, extending from the end of the 
half collar to beyond the middle of the body. In a second specimen 
these lines are absent. Lips and below, immaculate. Gastrosteges 
one hundred and forty-three; anal divided; urosteges thirty-eight. 

I have but two specimens of this variety, of which one is known to 
be from northwestern Texas, and the other of uncertain locality, but 
l)robably from the same region. In the smaller, the third superior labial 
is almost excluded from the orbit; in the latter it has the usual share. 
In the latter also the top of the head is brown, as is often the case in 
the usual variety. 

Boulenger has regarded this species as distinct in consequence of my 
ascription of 183 gastrosteges to it. This number, which appears in 
my original description, is a typographical error for 143.

Eye small, diameter twice in length of muzzle. Preorbital narrower 
above, not extending above lower margin of superciliary; loreal twice 
as long as liigb. Prefrontals and internasals much broader than long; 
frontal slightly angulate in front, longer than broad; parietals rather 
elongate, subtruncate behind. Postorbitals subquadrate, temporals 

1-2. Postgeneials minute, Superior labials

in another it is like the general ground color. In the same specimen 
the dorsal bars are very faint. 

Cat. No. 11417; upper labials, 7; gastrosteges, 167 + 1; urosteges, 52; rows of 
scales, 15. 

Urosteges in other specimens, fifty-one, fifty-two, fifty-three. 

I bave a specimen from Prof. W. T. Cummins from the Tule Canyon 
in the Staked Plain of Texas. 

I suspect that the Sonora semiannulata of Baird and Girard was estab- 
lished on an abnormal specimen of this species. That specimen is 
remarkable in having the .superciliary plate divided symmetrically on 
each side by a suture, which cuts off a ])]ate whose apex reaches the 
parietal, and which Baird and Girard term a third postocular. The 
muzzle was somewhat wrinkled, so as to produce folds of the integu- 
ment. This led to the mistaken belief that the nasal is divided. 
Omitting these two characters, there remains only a slightly more 
protuberant rostral plate, which is not more, in my opinion, than an 
individual peculiarity. The coloration is identical with that of the 
C. e. isozonus. More specimens will be necessary to settle the question 
definitely. Should the identification here suggested prove necessary, 
the name of the species will stand as Ghionactis semianmilatus, with the 
subspecies episcopus, torquatus, and semiannulatus. 

This form is further variable. In Cat. No. 1409G the number of gastros- 
teges and urosteges is less than in the C. e. isozonus; the nasal and 
loreal plates are of different shapes, and the rostral is more prominent. 
The color is also difi'erent. Otherwise the plate and scale forms are the 
same. 

The rostral is narrower when viewed from above, and is more pro- 
duced both forward and backward. The nasal is produced backward

to a narrow but obtuse angle. Loreal minute, with an acute apex for- 
ward. First temporal longer than deep; it is as deep as long in C. e. 
iso::oims. Gastrosteges, one hundred and forty-four; uiosteges, forty; 
the latter vary from fifty to fifty- three in the C. c. i.sozonus. The 
ground color is similar to that of the C. episcopus, an<l there are black 
crossbars which are less numerous and narrower tlian in the C. e. 
i.sozonus. There are twenty-two on the body and some obsolete specks 
on the tail. Lower surfaces everywhere immaculate. The crossbars 
appear as spots on the fourth and fifth rows of scales, and are better 
defined between these rows, and are one and a half to two scales wide. 
In G. e. isozoiius the black bands are three and four scales wide and are 
equidistant, and those of the tail are distinct on both superior and 
inferior surfaces.

Head slightly wider than neck. Rostral plate prominent, anguiate 
in ])rofile, rounded from above, superior surface with a small concavity, 
and equal to two thirds the length of the distance to the frontal plate. 
Occipitals longer than frontal, lateral borders concave posteriorly, and 
emarginate at the point of junction behind. Kostril pierced anterior 
to middle of nasal plate, which is truncate posteriorly and in contact 
with the subquadrate loreal. Oculars 1-2; temporals 1-2; three tem- 
porals bounding the occipitals larger than nuchal scales. Superior 
labials seven, all higher than long. Pregeneials rather elongate, bor- 
dered by four inferior labials, of which the fourth is the largest of the 
series. Postgeneials very small, separated by a scale. Gastrosteges 
one hundred and thirty-six; urosteges, thirty. 

Measurements. — Total length, 272 mm. ; length of tail, 39 mm. ; length 
to canthus oris (axial), 10 mm. 

Ground color above brown, with small spots longitudinally arranged; 
below yellowish unspotted. In the specimen in the national collection 
there is a series of small, brown, light-edged spots on the middle dor- 
sal line, which cover the halves or wholes of two scales both trans- 
versely and longitudinally. On each side of these is a more indistinct 
smaller dark-brown spot which may be confluent with them ; and fur- 
ther laterally there are traces of another series of spots. The brown 
ground color is produced by a dense speckling or reticulation of deep 
brown on a lighter ground, and these fine markings cover the cephalic 
scutes, and extend to the extremities of the gastrosteges. According to 
Bocourt there are sometimes three very indistinct longitudinal stripes? 

This species is well distinguished from the other members of the 
genus by the form of its occipital plates, and by the longer pregeneials. 
The same characters distinguish it from the Conopsis nasus. The color- 
ation is also characteristic. The form of the occipital shields is only 
partially displayed in Bocourt's figure, as cited, and none of my speci- 
mens of the C. nasus have even the small posterior emargination shown 
in Bocourt's figure of that species. In the regular rotundity of the out- 
line of the occipitals the Conopsis nasus agrees with the species of 
Chionactis excepting C. varians.

PSEUDOFICIMIA Bocourt. 
Pseudoficimia Bocoukt, Miss. Sci. Mexique, Reptiles, 1883, p. 572. 

Grooving of posterior maxillary teeth obsolete. Nasal plate divided 
below the nostril, which is below the internasal suture. Internasal 
plates present; rostral prominent. Anal and subcaudals divided. 
Pupil round. 

This genus is nearly allied to GhionacUs, but the teeth can not be 
said to be grooved, and the nasal is partly divided. For these reasons 
I formerly referred the typical species P. fronfaHs to Gcagras, but Dr. 
Boulenger points out that that genus is characterized by the position 
of the nostril at the junction of the nasals and internasal, which is not 
the case in this species. But one species of this genus is known.

loreal; postfrontal in contact with second superior labial. One narrow 
low preocular, two postoculars, the lower barely in contact with one 
temj)oral; temporals 1-2-3. Seven superior labials; eye over third and 
fourth. Occipitals longer than frontal, truncate, rounded behind; 
anterior suture of frontal a little longer than straight, lateral. Seven- 
teen rows of equal thin scales. Seven inferior labials; geneials very 
short, posterior pair reduced to scales. Urosteges, forty-four; one 
double anal; gastrosteges, one hundred and forty-one. 

Measurements. — End of muzzle to canthus oris, 15 mm.; to vent, 406 
mm.; length of tail, OG mm.; total, 502 mm. 

Color below uniform pale yellow; above grayish brown, becoming 
more rufous medially, with about thirty-six rhombic, dark-edged brown 
spots, six scales wide and four long, whose angles are produced as 
vertical lateral bars. Together they become nearly crossbands poste- 
riorly, when they are separated by a pale spot on the vertebral line. 
A brown cross-band across prefrontals and frontal; a longitudinal 
band on each occipital and side of nape. 

This is one of the species which range from the Sierra Caliente at 
Colima to the Austroccidental plateau at Guadalaxara.

Toluca, which agrees with it in all respects. I am not therefore 
inclined to agree with Boulenger that the characters it presents are 
anomalous, and that it is a form of Conopsis nasns. Besides the four 
plates in front of the frontal, and the postfrontals separated by the 
frontal, the coloration is also characteristic. The Conopsis Uneatus of 
Bocourt is a different species in my estimation, and, owing to the pres- 
ence of two pairs of regular plates on the muzzle, and a loreal, referable 
to the genus Ogmius.

XIV, 1892, p. 60.'? ; Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., No. 32, p. 52. 

Form stout, tail short. Head slightly distinct, large, depressed. 
Rostral plate acute, its anterior border elevated, its upper surface con- 
cave. It is produced backward, separating the internasals and pre- 
frontals. Internasals present, ])refrontals one pair. Nasal confounded 
with the first labial, a groove from the nostril to the suture of the sec- 
ond labial. No loreal; its jilace is supplied by the prefrontal. One 
preocular. Postgeneials rudimental. Scales smooth, anal and sub- 
caudal scutellai divided. Teeth small, of equal lengths. Pupil round. 

This genus introduces us to a type which is especially Mexican, and 
which includes the genera Flcimia Gray, Ogmius Cope, and Conopsis 
Giinther. Stenorhina Dumeril and Bibron is probably so allied, as well 
as perhaps Geagras Cope. They all have protuberant rostral shields, 
which are in the first three genera named more or less recurved. 
Besides the G. cammi, there is but one species of Gyalopium, the 
G. publium Cope,^ which has been found in Yucatan. 

Rostral plate reaching frontal; 17 rows of scales; seven labials; quadrate brown 
dorsal spots; larger G.pithliitm Cope. 

Rostral not reaching frontal; 17 rows of scales; seven superior labials; transverse 
brown bands; smaller (!. canum Cope.

Gastrosteges one hundred and thirty, one anal 5 urosteges twenty-eight. 
Measurements. — Total length, 188 mm. ; tail, 23 mm. 

Color above brownish gray, 
crossed by thirty-one irregular 
transverse brown bands. These 
are from one to three scales wide 
on the back and extend to the 
gastrosteges. Anteriorly they 
exhibit a tendency to divide into 
a dorsal and two lateral series of 
spots. Eight transverse spots 
on the tail. First spot on the 
neck large, produced medially to 
the occipitals. A brown band 
extends from one angle of the 
mouth to the other across the 
occipitals, involving the tip of 
the vertical. Another brown band begins upon the upper borders of 
the lower labial shields, passes through the eye, and crosses the ante- 
rior j)art of superciliaries and vertical and posterior parts of postfroii- 
tals and rostral. Dirty yellow beneath and upon the first row of scales. 
This serpent resembles at first sight a diminutive Heterodon.

Form stout, body cylindrical, the head not distinct. Muzzle rounded, 
very prominent, and much depressed. Eostral plate large, with an 
extensive superior surface, and presenting an obtuse angle between 
the prefrontals; the inferior surface greater than the superior, owing 
to the backward position of the mandible. Head shields broad, nor- 
mal, except in the confluence of the prefrontals with the nasals. 
Loreal none. One preocular, two post oculars. Scales smooth. Tail

CROCODILTANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 949 

This genus of burrowing snakes is analogous to Stenorhina in the 
union of the nasal and prefrontal shields. The form of the muzzle and 
inferior position of the mouth indicate affinity to ChionacUs. 

There are three species, which differ as follows: 

I. Rostral plates not separating interuasals. 

Postnasal not reaching preocular; two or three inferior labials reaching pre- 
geneials; light, eacli scale with a black point C. stramineua Cope. 

II. Rostral plates separating internasals. 

Postnasals touching or approaching preocular; three labials reaching pre- 
geueials ; cross- banded C. ephippicus Cope. 

Postnasal well removed from preocular; four or five labials reaching pregeneials; 
cross-banded C fasciatus Cope.

Scales in thirteen rows, all wide and obtuse, four rows on each side, 
wider than long. Rostral plate extensively recurved on the superior 
surface of the muzzle, its 
posterior border, present- 
ing an obtuse angle, which 
does not reach the pre- 
frontals. Internasals and 
prefrontal median suture 
short; frontal wide, but 
not as wide as long, augu- 
late in front, more strongly 
angulate behind. Each 
parietal but little if any 
larger than the frontal. 

Prefr#ntal in considerable contact with second superior labial. Seven 
superior labials all longer than high, except the first. Temporals 1-1, 
both deeper than long. Eyes and superciliary plates very small. Tail 
short and conical. 

Common suture of the prefrontals but half the length of their sutures 
with the frontal. Vertical presenting an obtuse angle anteriorly; 
the superciliary sutures converging posteriorly; posterior angle less 
than a right angle. Parietals short, their common suture scarcely longer 
than the prefrontal suture of the frontal. Superior labials seven, the 
second reaching the minute preocular, or should that plate be absent, 
as will probably occur occasionally, forming with the third and fourth 
the inferior border of the orbit. Inferior labials eight, fifth the largest. 
Geneials two pairs, posterior half the length of the anterior. Tem- 
porals 3-3; a larger central plate opposite the occipital suture. Scales

Of three specimens from Tucson, Arizona, Cat. No. 15788, the largest, 
has the j)ostnasal separate from the preocular, although not far removed ; 
in Cat. No. 15789, a much smaller specimen, the arrangement is the 
same, while in Cat. No. 15790, which agrees witli Cat. No. 15789 in 
dimensions, the posterior angle reaches the preocular as in the type. 
In the type of G, fasciatus the two plates are more widely separated 
than in Cat. No. 15789.

86; not of Cope. 

This species resembles the C. ephippicus in general appearance, but the 
scutellation is very different. In the wide separation of the nasal and 
preocular plates it resembles the G. 
stramineus^ but it differs from both 
species in the more numerous infe- 
rior labials and larger pregeneials. 
Thus, while in these there are but 
three labials iu contact with the 
pregeneials, there are in the G. fas- 
ciatus four or five of these plates 
in contact with the pregeneials. 

Two specimens are in the U. S. 
National Museum collection; one of these has twenty four and the 
other twenty-six black cross-bauds on a white ground. Of these four 
in one and five iu the other are on the tail. They are two scales long 
and eleven and two half scales in width ; the spaces between them two

Eostral plate projecting far backward, entirely separating the pre- 
frontals, encroaching upon the postfrontals ; the latter are in contact 
with the labials. Nostril connected by suture with the fronto-nasal 
suture. One very small preocular, two postoculars. Seven superior 
labials, the first longitudinal, the remainder vertical, except the last 
two, which are nearly equilateral. Symphyseal in contact with geneials. 
Scales broad, very smooth, in thirteen rows. Tail very short. Gastros- 
teges, eleven, one divided anal; urosteges, twenty-one i)airs. Total 
length seven inches, tail eight lines. Ground color white, with a red- 
dish tinge, encircled by sixteen black rings upon the body and three 
upon the tail. These rings are four or five scales in width, and sep- 
arated by equal spaces ; they are narrower on the belly. The head is 
black from the extremities of the occipital plates to the anterior part 
of the vertical and to the second labial plate. Chin shaded with black. 

One specimen is preserved in the Museum of Comparative Zoology, 
Cambridge, Massachusetts, and I am indebted to Dr. Alexander Agassiz 
for the opportunity of studying it. Two others are in the U. S. National 
Museum.

upon the body; they extend trans- 
versely from the seventh to the lifteeuth rows of scales, and are three 
or four scales in length. On the posterior part of the body they some- 
times divide longitudinally, their moieties alternating or becoming con- 
fluent into a zigzag band. Alternating with these on each side is a 
series of small spots formed by the brown borders of scales of the fifth 
and sixth rows. Another series of small spots oi)posite to the dorsal 
row is formed by the shading of the adjacent borders of the fourth and 
fifth rows with the same color. Many of the scales of the second row 
are also tipped with brown. There is a large brown spot on each side 
of the neck, sometimes confluent with an elongate central one, which 
extends to the occipital plates. A brown stripe passes from the eye 
to the neck spot, entirely covering the last upper labial. Top of the 
head brownish gray, indistinctly spotted with pale brown. Labial 
plate paler; frontals and rostral ochreous. Beneath yellowish white, 
immaculate.

KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



This form occurs iu Lower California, Sonora, and Ohihualiua. 

The form which I described as H. chlorophcva differs in its colors some- 
what from the usual type. It is found in Arizona. Its characters are 
as follows : 

Number of labials and rows of scales the same as in the last species. 
The scales of the body are, however, more elongate, and partly on this 
account are arranged in rows more oblique in an antero-posterior direc- 
tion. The vertical plate is a little broader, and the head is narrower 
in proportion to its length. The body is rather more slender. 

The color is a greenish ash, much darker than in the preceding spe- 
cies. The dorsal spots, instead of being brown, are black and sepa- 
rated by intervals of two scales in width. They are much smaller, 
occupying only the space from the ninth to the thirteenth longitudinal 
rows, and are one scale and a half long. They frequently divide and 
alternate, and their number on the body amounts to from fifty-eight to 
sixty-six. Two rows of smaller alternating spots appear on the sides, 
one upon the sixth and seventh rows of scales, the other on the fourth. 
The distribution of colors on the head and neck is much as is in the 
typical form, except that the neck spots are a little longer. The brown 
is, however, replaced by black, and the ochreous by olivaceous. The 
crown and muzzle are thickly punctuated with black. Beneath pale 
olivaceous. Gastrosteges, 167; urosteges, 55.

The genus yafrix is the water-snake form of all temperate regions 
aud of tropical Asia. The Europeau X. nairix is terrestrial lor the 
most part, but the North American and Indian species are very- 
aquatic, diving to the bottom of the water to escape enemies on the 
shore. The genus Eutienia., for the most part North American, includes 
many species of terrestrial habits, and they are all often ibund far from 
water. The E. saurita takes to the water if alarmed. A number of 
North American genera are degenerate forms of Natricina^, which hav^e 
adopted a terrestrial aud even a burrowing life like that of the Cala- 
marinie. iSforeria is like a Natrix reduced in the lateral head plates 
and with feeble jaws. Tropidoclonium is related in the same way to 
EuUvnia. Haldea and AmpMardis have a more decidedly fusiform 
character. HaMca displays the hypopophyses continued to the cau- 
dal region, as in the other members of the subfamily. 

The African members of the family are few in number, as but one 
species of Xatrix (N. mortuarlus) occurs there.

This genus is widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemi-

but is wanting on the Pacific district of the former. On the Ameri- 
can continent a single species, N. rhombifer Hallowell, extends as far

south as Vera Cruz from its Xortli American range. In the Old 
World two species only, T. mortuarius and T. ferox^ are found in 
Africa, and several species occur in the Malaysian Archipelago. They 
are all aquatic in their habits, liviug chiefly in and on the shores 
of fresh waters and feeding on small fishes and other aquatic verte- 
brates, especially frogs. Some of these species grow to a considerable 
size, and often present a savage appearance, owing to the small eyes 
and wide gape of the mouth. Even in these specimens the teeth are 
not large enough to inflict more than slight and harmless scratches. 

An allied genus accompanies this one in the East Indies (Aniphi- 
esma Dumeril and Bibron), in which the scales have no pits. In North 
America another allied genus {Eutcvnia) also has no pits, and is further 
characterized by the undivided condition of the anal scutum. 

I find twelve well-distinguished species in North America, which are 
characterized as follows : 

I. Temporal scuta 1-2 or 3; parietal scuta normal. 

a. Oculars 2-2 ; scales in 19 rows. 

Smaller, muzzle wider; three black stripes above; four brown ones below; 

first row of scales keeled .' N. leieris LinnjBUS. 

Larger, muzzle narrower ; no black bands above; two, sometimes three or 

four, imperfect bands below N. grahamii Baird and Girard. 

Muzzle short, brown above, with a broad median band; below yellow, with 

two rows of spots; first row of scales smooth N.rigida Say. 

aa. Oculars 1-2 ; scales in 21 rows. 

Superior labials 8; head elongate ; brownish yellow, immaculate. iY.Msto Cope. 
aaa. Oculars 1-3; scales in 19-21 rows. 

Four brown bands above ; a median row of yellow spots below. 

iV. clarkii Baird and Girard. 
Three rows of brown spots above, which may form stripes anteriorly and 
cross bands posteriorly; a median row of yellow spots below. 

N. compressicauda Kennicott. 
A row of lateral spots, often indistinct; below uniform; tail slender, cylin- 

dric N. valida Kennicott. 

aaaa. Oculars 1-2-3 ; scales in 23-25 rows. 

Superior labials 9; preoculars 2; spots longitudinal N.Mseeta Cope. 

Superior labials 8 ; jjieoculars 1 ; spots when present transverse. 

K. fasciata Linnaeus. 
aaaaa. Oculars 1, 2-3, 4; scales in 27-29 rows. 

Eye resting on (usually one) labial; alternating wide dorsal and lateral 

spots connected at angles N. rhomhifera Hallowell 

Eye separated from labials by scales; numerous narrow cross bauds, somi'- 
times broken N. cijclopiuvi Dumr'ril and Bibron. 

II. Temporal scales 2-4, 5; parietals much reduced in size. 
a. Oculars 1-2; scales 31-33 rows. 

Eye resting on one labial ; alternating dorsal and lateral spots, which do not 
touch N. taxispilota Holbrook. 

Of these species N. leheris and ISf. fasciata are distributed over both 
the Eastern and the Austroriparian districts. The other species belong 
to the Austroriparian district except the If. valida, which is the only 
species of the Sonoran district. The N. graliamii extends up the Mis- 
sissippi River to north of the Austroriparian limits to northern Illinois 
and Indiana, and is not known from onst of tbo latter State. K. rhom-

hifera has a similar distribution, except that it remains within the 
boundaries of the Austroripariau district, not extending north of south- 
ern Illinois and Indiana. K. eyclopium has not been found out of this 
district, while the X. compress icauda and H. usta are restricted to 
Florida. !{. taxispilota is confined to the eastern part of the Austrori- 
pariau region and Florida, while N. rigida has a similar range, omitting 
Florida, and apparently extending north to Pennsylvania. N. hisecta 
is known from but one specimen.

all carinated. Brown, with three series of subcinadrangular blackish 
blotches, which do not touch each other. 

The head is proportionally small, and conical forward. The eyes 
also are small. The frontal plate lias the shape of an elongated (juad- 
rangle. The parietal plates are quite small in consequence of lateral 
and posterior subdivisions. Rostral low, twice as wide as high. Inter- 
nasals much longer than wide; prefrontals nearly sijuare. Superior 
labials eight, the middle of the orbit over the fourth i)late, the fifth 
excluded by the lower i)osto('ular; sixth and seventh very large, some- 
times subdivided. Inferior labials eleven, the seventh the largest. 
Postgeneials not larger tliaii pre^cneials. There are two large post-

orbital plates. The superciliaries are narrow and elongated. Tem- 
porals more numerous tbau in any other species of the genus; two in 
the first row smooth, the remainder small, keeled, and nearly similar to 
the body scales. 

Ground color reddish brown, with three series of subquadrangular 
blackish blotches about forty-six in number, the twenty-sixth opposite 
the anus. They embrace transversely from seven to ten rows of scales, 
and longitudinally three scales on the two anterior thirds of the body, 
and two scales on the posterior third. The space between the blotches 
is equal to the blotches themselves. The lateral series are isolated ; that 
is to say, not contiguous to the dorsal series except sometimes toward 
the origin of the tail and along the latter region. The blotches extend 
over nine or ten lateral rows of scales, and affect from three to five 
scales. Equilateral on the anterior part of the body, they become nar- 
rower on the posterior part, and taper upward. The space between is 
narrower by one scale. On the tail the dorsal series of blotches has 
almost entirely disappeared; now and then an irregular patch may be 
seen confluent with the lateral series, which remain conspicuous to the 
very tip of that organ. The lower surface of the body is yellow, with 
irregular deep chestnut blackish-brown patches, the lateral ones con- 
tiguous to the lateral series. These may be so extended as to cover 
the greater part of the gastrosteges. Head uniform dark-brown; gulai' 
region thickly dusted with yellow and blackish.

This species is a very distinct one and is remarkable for various 
peculiarities. One of these is the great reduction in size of the parietal 
scuta, which frequently do not exceed the prefrontals in dimensions. 
This reduction has been supposed by Professor Heilprin to be excep- 
tional in the species, and he has accordingly named a specimen from 
Florida as a variety hrocTcii. The character is, however, normal in the 
species. The sixth and seventh superior labials are very large, and 
their superior portions are occasionally cut oft', as in Cat. No. 13887. In 
Cat. No. 10700 there are abnormally three postoculars on both sides, 
but this abnormality reaches a remarkable degree in Cat. No. 6109. 
Here a complete circle of scales which surrounds the eye, as in X. cijclo- 
pium^ consists of three preoculars and four or five postoculars. There 
are ten superior labials, of which the last three are divided longitudi- 
nally. The frontal plate has an incomplete median gro )ve and the 
parietals two incomplete grooves, pointing to a subdivision of head 
plates, such as occurs in some of the East Indian water snakes, as the 
genus Cerberus.

not as narrow as in some species, superciliaries much narrowed ante- 
riorly. Parietals large, obliquely truncated by a large second temj)oral, 
exceeding in length the muzzle in front of the frontal plate. Nasals 
short auteroposteriorly, the anterior elevated and narrow; postnasal 

making a suture with prefrontal. 
Loreal longer than high, very 
oblique behind. Preocularone, 
postoculars two ; suboculars two, 
separating the orbit from the su- 
perior labial plates. Temporals 
one, three; the first long, bor- 
dering two labials and a scute;

rows not keeled. Middle of eye

Superior labials eight, sixth and 
seventh large, sixth twice as 
high as wide. Inferior labials 
tw'elve, the seventh largest. 
Postgeneials shorter than i^re-

Color brown above and yel- 
low below. On the upper sur- 
faces there are on each side two 
rows of alternating short cross- 
bars of a darker color, which 
are about one and one-half scales 
wide, and are separated by in- 
terspaces of about three scales. 
The median line for a width of 
four scales is not spotted, or is 
very imperfectly so, forming a 
broad vertebral band of a color 
darker than the general ground. 
In young specimens the pattern 
is very distinctly seen, but in 
adults the ground becomes so 
dark as to obscure it very much. 
The head is uniform brown, the oral edge of the superior labial plates 
only being yellow. On the yellow ground of the inferior surfaces there 
appear, on the anterior third only of the length, dark shades on the 
anterior parts of the gastrosteges. These extend and blend so that on 
the posterior two-thirds of the length in the adult the color may be said 
to be blackish-brown with yellow^ spots.

This well-marked species is much less abundant than its allies, the 
iV'. rhomhifera and N. taxispiloia. The few specimens in the U. S. 
National Museum come from the three extreme points of the austro- 
riparian districts, namely, Florida, New Orleans, and southern Illinois. 

The ^^ ej/clopiinn is nearest the N. rhomhifera. The i)atteru of color- 
ation is quite different, and the scutellation also differs in several im- 
portant respects. In the X. ciiclopimn the nasal plates are shorter 
anteroposteriorly, and there are only two scuta which are properly post- 
ocular. The posterior temporals are smoother and not heeled, and the 
large scales are emarginate, which they are not in the X. rhomhifera. 

The possession of a series of scales below the orbit, while present in 
all known specimens of this species, is not confined to it. I have seen 
it In a specimen of the X. taxispilotaj and it is found in the only known 
specimen of the Matrix anoscopus- Cope, from Cuba.

of the middle and lateral series are connected by oblique black bars, 
which thus inclose with the dorsal spots a series of transverse diamond- 
shaped or hexagonal spaces of the ground color on the middle region 
of the back. The lateral interspaces are partly closed below by two 
semicircular spots of brown on the two gastrosteges below them; aud 
the two gastrosteges below the lateral spots also have brown spots of

is unspotted or has but feeble traces of spots. I counted thirty-five dorsal 
and as many lateral spots on a specimen from New Orleans (Cat. 'No.

The head is a uniform brown above; aud on the nape is an obscure 
chevron-shaped black mark, with an obtuse angle forward. The superior 
labials have black posterior borders and are tinged with yellow medially. 
The inferior labials are similar, but more distinctly yellow. Scales of

From the large proportion of specimens in which the end of the tail 
is lost, I suspect the enemies of this species are numerous. Can they 
be turtles?

geueials subequal. General foriu robust; tail not long. Head quite dis- 
tinct from body, widened posteriorly, moderately narrowed to the muzzle. 

Ground color aboye from bright reddish brown to gray, marked by 
large dark brown transverse spots variously arranged, or immaculate. 
Below, yellowish or reddish, with or without chestnut or reddish-brown 
spots which are not tessellated, but are more or less rounded. Length, 
about a meter. 

This abundant and widely distributed species i^resents several well- 
marked subspecies which have been sometimes described as species. 
These generally have a definable geographical range. Together they 
occupy the entire Eastern and Austroriparian regions. 

Belly with dark spots which are lateral and angular; gastrosteges not margined; 
spots of back broad especially anteriorly, continued to belly ; sides of head pale, 
with black postocular band ; scales generally in 23 rows ..N.f. fasciatus Linn^us. 

Belly with gastrosteges narrowly margined with brown, margins inclosing yellow 
spots by junction at or near ends; dorsal spots numerous, narrower, extending to 
belly; sides of head pale, with brown postocular band; scales in 25 rows; 

N. f. pictiventris Cope. 

Belly spotted; back with brown spots which extend to the sides anteriorly only, 
but which mostly alternate with lateral spots; no postocular band; 

X. f. sipedon Linnaeus. 

Belly spotted; dorsal band transverse anteriorly; posteriorly wanting, and lateral 
spots only N.f. pleuralis Cope. 

Belly unspotted; dorsal and lateral spots alternate to the head; 

N. f. transversa HaHowell. 

Belly unspotted; neither dorsal nor lateral spots N.f. erythrogaster Shaw. 

These subspecies belong to the Austroriparian region, except N'. s. 
sipedon, which is nearly confined to the Eastern, and JS\ s. transversa, 
which belongs to the Texan district. 

It is semiaquatic in its habits, being usually found on the border of 
the water, where it takes refuge when alarmed. It is an expert swim- 
mer and a skillful fisher, since fishes form a large part of its food. - It 
captures fishes by quick movements below the surface of the water. 
When cornered it is pugnacious, but its bite is insignificant. Its aver- 
age adult length is three feet, but it frequently exceeds that size.

and fifth largest. A large temporal shield anteriorly contiguous to the 
postorbitals, followed by two other large scuta. 

Ground color above in the adult uniform blackish brown, lighter in 
the young, crossed by transverse lozenge-shaped blackish patches 
irregularly tapering on the sides throughout the length. There are 
from thirty to thirty-eight subtriangular or vertical oblong red spots 
extending between three cross-bands to the abdominal scutella'. The 
twenty-sixth of these red markings is opposite to the anus, and twelve 
smaller ones may be observed along the tail, gradually diminishing 
posteriorly. A black vitta extends from the posterior rim of the eye 
to behind the angle of the mouth, above and below which a light 
elongated patch tinged with red may be seen. Labials dusky, mar- 
gined with reddish brown, lielly yellowish or reddish, marked with

darker reddish spots on one side or tlie other, which are more or less 
black bordered, or the entire gastrostege may be black edged, and in 
some specimens the black edges are so wide as to cover almost all of 
the plate, so that the belly and under side of the tail are black. (Cat. 
Nos. 13024-13028; New Orleans.) 

The number of spots crossing the back is very variable. They are 
usually wider than in the N. f. sipedon and in some individuals are of 
double or treble the width. In that case the interspaces have an 
oblique direction. Such si^ecimens are most common in Louisiana, 
while those with short cross-bands, separated by narrow intervals, are 
more usual in Florida. In a specimen from Volusia, Florida, in my 
collection there are thirty-three cross- bands anterior to the tail, and 
the gastrosteges are yellow, with a narrow brown border at the base. 
These borders spread out at the end of every second or third scutum 
into a reddish-brown spot.

This snake has considerable resemblance in color to the moccasin, 
Ancistrodo7ipiscivorus, which iiibabits the same localities, so that it is 
commonly mistaken for it by nncritical observers. Its more slender 
form should, however, distinguish it, even on the most casual obser- 
vation.

Brown transverse bands numerous, separated by short intervals, and 
extending- to the belly throughout the length. Gastrosteges narrowly 
margined at the base with brown, the margins turning at or before 
reaching the ends of the gastrosteges and uniting so as to inclose trans- 
verse yellow spots, which are wider than those seen in N. compressi- 
candus. Sides of head light brown, generally with a black postocular

In some specimens (Cat. Xo. 13779) the transverse bands are very dis-

connected by the same color along the median vertebral line. 

This subspecies is restricted to Florida. It approaches the X. com- 
pressicauda in the coloration of the belly.

REPORT OF NATIONAL- MUSEUM, 1898. 



General color dull brown, exhibiting narrow transverse bands of 
lighter, margined with dark brown or black; these bands generally 
about a half a scale in width and their margins more or less parallel 
immediately on the back. This is especially the case posteriorly, where 
they are usually at rigiit angles to the axis of the body, anteriorly they 
are more or less oblique, and widen rapidly toward the abdomiual 
scutelhx'. Sometimes the general brown line is so predominant as to 
reuderthe transverse marks more or less obsolete, and the general tint 
then appears uniform above. The abdomen is always dull yellowish, 
each scutella with large blotches of light brown, margined with black. 

In young individuals and in those generally in which the epidermis 
has been removed, the normal type of coloration is seen to consist of 
three series of nearly quadrate dark brown spots, with still darker bor-

der, one dorsal and one on each side. These are so disposed that the 
two corresponding lateral spots are opposite the interval between the 
two dorsal, and thus appear to be connected by a light line. The longi- 
tudinal diameter of the dorsal spots, amounting to three or four scales, 
is the greater; Just the reverse of what is the case with the lateral. Of 
these lateral spots there are generally about thirty, two on each side 
from the head to the anus, the spaces between to or less than the spots, 
not greater, as in T.fasciata. While the pattern is generally quite dis- 
tinguishable on the posterior half of the body, anteriorly it becomes 
confused, the lateral blotches standing opposite to the dorsal and becom- 
ing confluent, so that the back appears crossed by lozenge-shaped 
blotches extending to the abdominal scutellfe, and this separated on 
the sides by triangular intervals of a lighter color. 

Occasionally the color appears to be a dull and rather light brown,

This subspecies is characteristic of the Eastern region. There is 
considerable doubt whether it enters the Austroripariau fauna. If so, 
it appears sparingly, and only on the northern borders. Specimen Cat. 
No. 9008, from Montgomery, Alabama, might be almost as well placed 
with the N'. /. transversa, as the belly is unspotted, but the anterior 
half of the body is cross banded as in the N. f. fasciata. Northwardly 
its range extends into New Brunswick. It is reported by Verrill as 
common at Norway, Maine.^ It is the common "water snake" of the 
Middle States.

NATRIX FASCIATA PLEURALIS Cope. 

Scutellation as in the species generally ; scales in twenty-three rows, 
the inferior more weakly keeled and of larger size than the others. 
Internasals longer than wide; oculars 1-3; middle of orbit above 
suture between fourth and fifth superior labials. 

The color characters are quite peculiar. On tlie anterior part of the 
body brown bands cross the ground color reacliing to the gastrosteges, 
the lateral parts having parallel sides, and being separated by spaces 
wider than themselves. The dorsal i)arts of these cross-bands grad- 
ually disappear and posterior to the middle or last third of the length 
are wanting, so that the coloration consists of lateral erect parallelo- 
grammic spots separated by spaces of a yellow or gray ground color, 
equal to or a little wider than themselves. Belly yellow, with brown, 
rounded spots on the anterior parts of the gastrosteges; spots few on 
the anterior third in the type. Head brown without markings; labials 
lighter.

This form is Austroriparian, but seems to be rare, as but two specimens 
have come under my observation. They approach the forms of N. 
sipedon, with lateral spots well separated. 

The large specimen, Cat. No. 8786, referred to this subspecies, is so 

dark colored that the pattern is only made out when immersed in fluid. 

The belly also is marked by narrow transverse blotches on the external 

parts of the gastrosteges, which afterwards blend and involve the 

whole surface.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



The head is broad behind and tapers forward, very much flattened 
above. The labials are eight above and eleven below; the fifth, sixth, 
and seventh the largest on both jaws. 

Ground color dusky, with a dorsal series of subquadrangular brown 
blotches, alternating with the lateral series as far as the head; with 
anterior and posterior margins nearly parallel, rarely tapering down- 
ward and reaching the abdominal scutelhv. The fuscous space between 
the lateral blotclies is wider than that occupied by the blotches them- 
selves. Along the tail both the dorsal and lateral blotches are small 
and subcircular. Underneath the color is yellowish, and the scutellse 
in the young margined posteriorly with black, while in the adult the 
middle region of the scutell.ne is unicolor. The head is brownish-black,

with a double yellow spot near the commissure of the occipital plates, 
and two spots of the same color on the commissural line between the 
vertical and supercilliaries. A black vitta extends from the posterior 
rim of the eye to the angle of the mouth. 

This form has normally two more rows of scales than the subspecies 
fasciatus and sipedon. The alternation of the dorsal and lateral spots 
is more universal than in either of them, while the unspotted abdomen 
relates it to the subspecies N.f. erythrogaster of tlie same geographical 
region.

Head elongated, narrowing forward. Gastrosteges most numerous 
of all the subspecies of the Natrix sipedon. Three i)Ostorbitals. An 
elevjited loreal. Dorsal rows of scales, twenty-three, sometimes twenty- 
five, in number, all very strongly carinated. Uniform dark bluish 
black above, lighter on the sides; a lateral or external band of dull 
blue extending on the abdominal scutelke. Body beneath (in alcohol) 
uniform dull yellow, tail bluish. 

The head is proportionally narrow and elongated, flattened above 
and convex on the snout. The frontal plate is elongated and sub- 
pentagonal, broader anteriorly than posteriorly, with tlie sides slightly 
concave. The jjostorbital plates, proportionally small, are three in 
number. Loreal large and polygonal, higher than long. There are 
three or four temporal shields very much developed, but one in contact 
with postorbitals. Dorsal rows of scales twenty-three or twenty- four 
in number, strongly carinated with the keels on the posterior third of 
the body, constituting very conspicuous and continuous ridges, the 
intermediate depressions or furrows giving to the body and tail a 
canaliculated appearance. The lateral or outer row, however, is but 
slightly carinated. The tail itself is subconical, very much tapering, 
forming one-fourth of the entire length.

Cat. No. 1347, U.S.N.M. 

A singular form of this subspecies was taken by Dr. H. C. Yarrow 
in Virginia (Cat. No. 13572). It is steel gray above, and dirty white 
below, the belly with gray punctulations increasing in density poste- 
riorly. Traces of dark gray spots on the ends of the gastrosteges, most 
distinct on the posterior third of the length. No head markings. 
Another peculiar specimen is Cat. No. 10732, from Florida, in which 
district tlie subspecies seems to be rare. The median dorsal line is 
crossed by pairs of dark brown cross-bands, the spaces they inclose 
representing the spaces between the spots of the JSf. s. sipedon. They

Eostral broad, low, divided iu two by a vertical suture. Loreal higher 
than long. Oculars 2-3, the superior anterior shorter than the inferior; 
the inferior posterior so produced forward as to exclude the fifth supe- 
rior labial from the orbit. Superior labials nine, the fourth only enter- 
ing the orbit. Temi)orals 1-3, the superior of the second series elongate. 

The color is olive-brown above, dirty white below. There is a row of 
blackish spots along the sides, of small size, which cover the adjacent 
parts of three scales of the first and second rows, and which are sepa- 
rated by an interspace of one and a half scales. These sj)ots are 
wanting from the anterior fourth of the length. Above the interval 
between them there is, on each side, a longitudinal dusky spot, which 
is entirely separate from that of the opposite side, and which is sepa- 
rated from the adjacent ones by a space of a lighter brown than the 
ground color. These longitudinal spots begin at the head and dis- 
appear near the middle of the length, after acquiring a tendency to 
extend obliquely downward and backward. Head without marks, 
except three pale spots on the parietals ; one on each side of the median 
suture, and one at the angle of the frontal. Belly unicolor, except at 
the lateral spots, which extend over the posterior angle of the gastros- 
teges. Inferior surface of tail black-speckled.

A single specimen of this species was found in the grounds adjacent 
to the central station of the United States Fish Commission in the 
heart of the city of Washington, and no second one has been obtained. 
It is a singular circumstance that this species should have remained so 
long unknown. By its scutellation and color pattern it is absolutely 
distinct from any other siiecies of the genus, either of America or any 
other country. It is probably one of the rare species like theiV. rigida 
and the Hyla andersonii, which are only seen at long intervals.

This species, although restricted to the peninsula of Florida in its 
range, presents us with four subspecies, which differ greatly in color- 
ation. They are defined in the following table: 

Scales in 19 rows; above blackish brown, with nuiuerous closely placed cross-bands. 

N. c. compsolama. 

Scales in 21 rows ; four series of longitudinal spots above, those of the median pair 

forming two longitudinal stripes on the greater part of the length; the laterals 

forming stripes on the neck only N. c. ianiata. 

Scales in 21 rows; numerous dark cross bands, which are resolved into three rows of 
spots. just anterior to the tail, and four longitudinal stripes on the neck. 

i\r. c. compreasicanda. 

Scales in 21 rows; sooty above, with transverse bands anteriorly N. c. ohscnra. 

Scales in 23 rows; yellowish, with narrow brown cross bauds; no postocular baud. 

N. c. walkerii. 

The yellow colors are brighter in the smaller individuals, and the 
dark color of the inferior surfaces is darker. The ends of the gastros- 
teges have a yellow spot, which becomes wider in older individuals, 
reducing the extent of the dark ground to a stripe-like shade.

l)ifer^ and does not taper from tlie anus, but narrows abruptly at one- 
tliird its length from the base. Dorsal rows twenty-one, all distinctly 
carinate. The scales are rather broad and much rounded posteriorly, 
those of the first dorsal row disproportionately small. The head is 
elongate and rather narrow posteriorly, but very deep and but little 
depressed on the snout. All the plates of the crown are large; the 
frontal very broad and short, the loreal longer than high, the upper and 
lower postorbitals small, but the central elongated so as to reach the 
labial plates. 

The ground color is light olive brown, crossed on the anterior half of 
the body by wavings or somewhat zigzag transverse black bands, cov- 
ering two or three scales longitudinally, and separated by intervals of 
one or two scales. These bands do not taper regularly on the sides, as 
in T. sipedon, but are constricted upon the sixth row on each side, but 
are wide upon the third, as upon the vertebral row. Posteriorly these 
bands become narrower, and finally break up into a dorsal series of 
vertically elongated spots, and a lateral series of small circular ones, 
which do not alternate with the dorsal series, as in IV.f. sipedon, taxispi- 
lota, and others. For two inches behind the head the transverse 
bands are replaced by four distinct longitudinal black lines, the lateral 
ones covering the third, fourth, and part of the second rows, the upper 
ones covering the seventh, eighth, ninth, and part of the tenth rows; 
these black lines are separated by a little over one scale of ground 
color. None of the black markings involve the first dorsal row, which is 
yellowish olive, excepting some irregular dark mottlings. The head is 
yellowish olive, with the middle of the parietals and frontal and a 
patch extending from the eye back above the labials black. The ros- 
tral is yellow, distinctly margined above with black. All the labials 
above and below, and the inframaxillary plates are yellow, ijromineutly 
margined with black. The abdomen is yellow, with two lines of black 
blotches.

Some specimens from Georgiana, Florida, present the following char- 
acters: They represent the supposed form Mvitatus, but are only young 
of the typical form. Head oval, distinct from neck ; tail long, moder- 
ately compressed at base; less than in types. Eostral plate elevated; 
internasals longer than wide; frontal elongate and with parallel sides. 
Loreal oblique, longer than high; oculars, 1-3, the inferior posterior not 
below the orbit, but nearly cutting the fifth superior labial out of its 
border. Temporals, 1-3; superior labials, eight; middle of orbit above 
suture between fourth and fifth. Inferior labials, ten; postgeneials 
larger than pregeneials. Scales of body in twenty-one series, all keeled.

former region is crossed in the typical specimen by thirty-six blackish- 
brown crossbars, which are wide and close together on the median 
dorsal region, and tapering-, and therefore separated on the sides. The 
dorsal parts of the spots nnite and form two wide longitudinal bands on 
the anterior fifth of the length. A pale brown band passes from the 
superciliary phite to the side of the neck, leaving a dark j^ostorbital band 
below. All the plates of the lips and throat are yellow, and have nar- 
row black borders. On the yellow of the belly there are black spots 
on the gastrosteges which incline to fuse transversely, leaving a i)art 
of the ground visible in the middle. Anteriorly this arrangement 
assumes the form of two longitudinal black bands, which are well de- 
fined on the anterior fourth of the length, leaving a yellow band between 
and one on the outer side of tliem.

seniidiscoid yellow spots; gastrosteges 
with yellow extremities for the anterior two-thirds of the length of 
body. The median neck spots touch on the nape of the neck, and after 
inclosing a pale space unite on the parietal i)lates. Muzzle brown, the 
labials with blackisli shades. Lower labials, geneials, and gulars witlT 
yellow spots. Indistinct parietal paired spots.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



Measurements. — Total length, 378 mm.; tail, 98 mm. 

Two specimens in my private collection from Volusia, Florida. 

In this form the striping which appears on the neck of the form com- 
pressicauda is extended the entire length. It bears thus a i)artial 
resemblance to the Natrix clarkii, which is not far removed in affinity 
from the N. compressicauda. The form described as N.fasciata pictiven- 
tris connects N. compressicauda with the N.fasciata. 

NATRIX COMPRESSICAUDA WALKERII Yarrov. 

Tropidonotus compressicaudus walkerii Yakrow, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., YI, 1883, 
p. 154. 

The scuta of this subspecies are quite as in the last ; as in the form of 
the rostral, internasal, and frontal plates and the relation of the orbit to 
the superior labials. Its chief peculiarities are in its twenty-three rows 
of dorsal scales, and in its coloration. In the latter it approaches the

Cat. No. 10681, U.S.N.M. 

N. c. compsolcema. Color above brownish yellow, crossed by numerous 
brown crossbars which are as wide as the spaces which separate them — 
namely, two scales — and which extend to the first row of scales. These 
bars become wide on the part of the body near the head, and are split by 
the ground color without forming bands, except two short ones which 
form a V on the i^arietal plates. No postorbital band. Labials dusky, 
yellow bordered in front; geneials the same, with a large median yellow 
spot on each. Abdomen dusky with a median row of round yellow 
spots, which soon become irregular in number and i^osition. Ends of 
gastrosteges yellow on the anterior fifth of the length. 

Cat. No. 10681 (tail injured); gastrosteges, 137 + 1; length, 467 mm. 

In the absence of the longitudinal stripes on the superior surface 
posterior to the head, this form differs materially from the typical 
form.

NATRIX COMPRESSICAUDA OBSCURA Lcennberg. 

Natrix compresaicauda ohacura Lcennbekg, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XVII, 1894, 
p. 330. 

I have not seen this form. It is thus described by Dr. Lcennberg: 

Scales in twenty-one rows. The color of the back is dark bluish gray, " soot 
color." On this ground the three series of spots can scarcelj' be distinguished, 
except on the anterior part of the body where they form transverse bands; the head 
is too dark to show any postocular bands; upper and lower labials, as well as 
mentals, with yellowish spots ; the ground color of the belly is gray, a little reddish. 
On each side on the dorsal margin of the gastrosteges there is a small light spot; a 
median black band extends from the first gastrosteges to the tip of the tail. On the 
anterior part there is a yellowish spot on each gastrostege in this black band, and 
the thirty anterior spots cover this band nearly completely, but farther back they 
become smaller and less distinct, disappearing on the tail. 

From Key West, Florida. 

NATRIX COMPRESSICAUDA COMPSOL^EMA Cope. 
Tropidonotus compsola'mns Cope, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1860, p. 368. 

Scales ill nineteen longitudinal rows, and keeled. Eostral plate 
twice as broad as high. Prefrontals subtriangular; loreal longer than 
high. One rather narrow jjreocular; postoculars three, the lowest 
very small. Vertical and superciliaries elongate; lateral border of the 
former scarcely converging; the latter narrow, Superior labials eight; 
fourth and fifth entering the orbit. Inferior labials nine. Tail slender, 
slightly compressed at the base, three-tenths of the total length. Gas- 
trosteges, 126; a divided anal; urosteges, G7. 

Measurements. — Total length, 400 mm.; tail, 86 mm. 

Above, blackish brown, darkest anteriorly. Very indistinct pale 
transverse bauds are apparent. They are irregularly oblique and sep- 
arated by intervals of two or three scales wide. Superior and inferior 
labials more or less completely margined anteriorly with yellow ; geneial 
sind gular plates spotted irregularly with the same. (Jeneral color 
beneath a peculiar stone brown. A darker shade occupies the center 
of the gastrosteges as far as the vent. This is almost excluded ante- 
riorly by a central series of transversely elliptical yellow spots, one near 
tlie anterior border of each gastrostege. These become narrower and 
broken, and upon the posterior two thirds of the belly are almost lost. 
There is a very indistinct row of smaller spots upon each side of it 
anteriorly. 

This species should be compared with A\f. sipedon and X. ralida. It 
differs from the first in the numbers of rows of scales, and from all 
three in the form of the muzzle and coloration of the lower surface.

larly convex. Superciliary plates narrow and elongate. Vertical elon- 
gate, its lateral borders concave, not convergent posteriorly, its length 
greater than that of the occipital suture. Froutals small, the anterior 
almost triangular. Nasals and loreal rather large, the posterior border 
of the latter very oblique. Preocular one, postoculars three, superior 
labials eight, eye resting on the fourth and fifth, sixth and seventh 
largest and bounded above by the first temporal. Remaining tempo-

geiieials longer than the anterior. General form rather slender, tail 
one-fifth the total length. Gastrosteges, 145; one divided anal; uros- 
teges, 71. 

The general color is leaden black above and below, with the following 
paler markings: A band of leaden gray begins upon the neck, occupy- 
ing the second, third, and i)art of the first rows of scales. This extends 
to the anus, becoming darker and leaving the first row of scales poste-

bands extend from this, separated by black spaces of one and a half or 
two scales in width, which spaces are sometimes inclosed by the conflu- 
ence of the bands on each side of the black vertebral line. 

This subspecies may be distinguished from those called Eutcenia by 
Baird and Girard by its divided postabdominal scutelke. It, how- 
ever, bears quite a close resemblance to some of them, for example, 
E. pickeringi.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



Head elongated, couical from occiimt to the extremity of the snout, 
depressed above, subconcave on the occipital region, slightly sloping 
on the snout. Cephalic plates very much developed. Frontal subpen- 
tagonal, broader anteriorly, though slightly tapering. Internasals 
quite large. Three, or sometimes only two, postorbitals, variable in 
comparative size; when there are three the lowermost is suborbital. 
One anteorbital, large. Loreal well developed, longer than high. Upper 
labials eight, fifth and sixth largest, the latter very large. Scales of 
the body elliptical, rounded posteriorly in twenty-one rows. Outer 
row somewhat larger than the rest and very slightly carinated. 

Color of head dirty brown, occipital and temporal region blackish. 
Each of the four longitudinal bands of deep brown covers two rows of 
scales. The intermediate yellowish brown spaces embrace each two 
rows of scales also, except the dorsal one, which has three rows. Each 
of the abdominal clouded bands embraces one-fourth of abdominal space, 
inside of which is left a yellow space one-fourth of the width and 
exteriorly another yellow space one- eighth of the width of abdominal 
space. The tail beneath is blackish, owing to the confluence of the 
abdominal bands, interspersed with yellowish macuLie. 

This is the western representative of the Floridian N. compressicauda^ 
and, like it, the basal part of the tail is compressed, but not to so high 
a degree. Its head is more acuminate than in either that species or the 
N. valida. The coloration of the belly is a good deal like that of the 
W. compressicauda, but the dorsal striation is totally distinct. How- 
ever, a beginning of this character also may be seen on the anterior 
part of the Floridian species, for the dorsal spots are split, and their 
halves unite into two longitudinal bands.

gated and narrow tenii»oral shield, followed by two or three smaller. 
Upper labials seven, fifth and sixth very large. Lower labials eleven, 
sixth and seventh largest. Scales elliptical, narrower along the middle 
line of the back, carinated, except the outer row. which is perfectly 
smooth, an(l furthermore distinguished by the scales having their height 
greater than their length. The second row is noticeable for its size, and 
sometimes for its want of carination, which in all cases is obsolete. 

The groundcolor is unifoim greenish brown, but each scale on the 
flanks is marked with a small blotch of deeper brown at its base. The 
brown vittse of the back cover each one entire row and the half of 
the two adjoining rows, separated on the dorsal line by one row and 
two half-scales of the ground-color. Beneath dull yellowish. Along 
the middle region of the abdomen there are two series of elongated 
deep brown blotches approaching each other toward the anterior 
region and under the tail, sometimes, however, not extending beyond 
the anus.

Chestnut brown, with a lateral yellow band, and three narrow, black 
dorsal vitta\ Abdomen yellowish, with four brown bands, two of 
which are lateral and two medial. Dorsal rows of scales 19, all cari- 
nated. 

Head small, little distinct from body, depressed, flattened on the 
region behind the orbit, sloping anteriorly. Rostral plate low, nearly 
twice as wide as deep. Internasals wider than long. Frontal ijarie- 
tals elongate equal distance from their front angle to rostial. There 
are two anteorbitals, the upper one the hirger; and two postorbitals, 
the upper one the smaller. The loreal is large and higher than long. 
One temporal shield only in the lirst row; two or three large ones in 
the second. Upper labials seven, third and fourth entering orbit, fifth 
and sixth largest. Lower labials ten, fifth and sixth largest. Scales 
regularly elliptical, slightly notched posteriorly, and all of them cari- 
nated, gradually diminishing in width from the sides toward the mid- 
dle line of the back. Those of the outer row one-third broader than 
the rest, and posteriorly subtruncated. 

Ground color dark chestnut or chocolate brown above, marked with 

three narrow, black vittie or bands, one covering the medial row of 

dorsal scales, and two (one on each side) following the filth row. A 

lateral yellow band occupies the upper half of the outer row and the

whole of the second row, thus broader than the black bauds above. 
Immediately below, and contiguous to it, a somewhat larger brown 
band covers the lower half of the outer row of scales and the extremity 
of the abdominal scutellii\ The abdomen is yellowish, provided along 
its middle region with two approximate brown bauds, similar, though 
a little narrower, and interrupted by the yellowish edge of the scutelLie. 
The tail beneath is almost rendered uniformly brown by the confluence 
of the bands. 

This species inhabits a wide range of territory, and displays very 
little variation in any respect. It is entirely aquatic in its habits,

calls to miud that of the Carphophiops amccnus of Say. It is, however, 
much larger, and the scales are very strongly carinated. The cariuae 
are found on all the longitudinal rows of scales, of which there are 
nineteen exclusive of the belly scales. The external row is almost as 
sharply keeled as those on the back, even to the tij) of the tail. The 
dorsal scales are narrow and elongated; the sides nearly parallel except 
near the ends. As already stated, the head is very small, the vertical 
plate is subhexagonal, the two anterior sides forming a very obtuse 
angle; the external edges are very convergent posteriorly. The nos- 
trils in the middle of the two plates. There are one anteorbital and 
two postorbitals ; there are six labials above and seven below, in addi- 
tion to the rostrals. The ground color of this snake is a light purplish 
brown, with four rows of large, nearly circular, blotches covering the 
whole back and sides. They are arranged so as to alternate; the outer 

blotches on the outer row 
are a little larger than 
those on the two central 
ones, and are of the width 
offour or five scales. The 
belly is of a pale brick 
red, fading to brownish 
yellow in alcohol, with 
a well-defined blotch of 
black near the exterior 
of each scale. These give 
rise to a series of very 
well-defined round black 
spots ou either side of 
the abdomen, and there 
is also an obscure series 
of dark blotches on the 
anterior edge of the scales in the exterior dorsal row. The dots in this 
series are separated by intervals of two unmarked scales. The spots of 
this row alternate with those of the larger series immediately above. 

On separating the scales the skin is seen to be colored like the adja- 
cent scales. It is black in the dark blotches and very light in the 
intermediate space, giving rise to the appearance of a whitish edge to 
the scales. There are thus four series of large spots ou the back and 
sides, two on the belly, and two on the exterior dorsal rows, making 
eight in all. The last-mentioned row is sometimes very obscure, the 
others are always distinct. Keuuicott referred this serpent to the 
genus Tropidonotus {Matrix), although it is different from the known 
species. It is somewhat like the W. rigida, but is differently marked, 
the latter having the two abdominal rows of spots close together on the 
middle of the belly instead of being separated. Neither is there any 
indication in N. rigida of the four series of dorsal blotches. In fact 
there is no North American species more strongly marked than this.

As yet this species has only been detected in the northern central

obtained have been fonnd in the woods, generally under logs. Its 
habits are thus not like those of a yatrix. It is rather sluggish and 
not very pugnacious. 

In its distribution this species is one of the group which is restricted 
to a few of the northern States of the Mississippi Valley. These are 
Wisconsin, Mi(!higan, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio.

Professor Hay remarks : ' 

This species is common about Iitdianapolis, almost as common as Eutainia Hrfalis. 
It is fonnd in Monroe County (D. S. Jordan) ; Crawfordsville (Beacliler) ; Winchester 
(Engle and Wright) ; rare about Terre Haute, common in Putnam County (Blatchley). 

This is a handsome species of snalce, and one that is wliolly innocent ; neverthe- 
less it exercises the right of the innocent, and when attacked makes a show of self- 
defense. It has a habit of flattening itself excessively, so that it becomes very 
broad and thin. It will strike vigorously, but does no harm. It apjjears early in 
the spring, and is seen late in the autumn. In a nuld winter and on a sunny day, I 
have seen it on January 25. On the other hand, I have seen it as late as the middle 
of October; indeed, it appears to be more abundant late in the autumn than in the 
summer. About this date, several half-grown ones were found. On the 21st of 
March one was dug up out of the mud on the margin of a pond. A specimen from 
Win(!liester, Indiana, contained eight eggs. These had apparently not begun devel- 
opment, and were only about 0.11 inch long. The species probably produces living 
young.

sometimes of the third and fourth, which bound the orbit. Inferior 
labials seven, fourth largest; postgeneial equal pregeneial, separated 
by scales. Frontal shield longer than broad, outlines straight, poste- 
rior angle less than right; occipitals nearly as long as from their border 
to rostrals, emarginate behind. Gastrosteges 120-135; anal 1-1 ; uros- 
teges 37-51. Color olive-brown (one specimen light brown), with 
dense, minute punctuations above and below, and about fifty-four light- 
edged black crossbars extending over six rows of scales, alternating 
with shorter ones on the sides; both are broken into spots on the neck, 
where there is a large postoccipital blotch on each side. 

Measurements. — Total length, 230 ram. ; length of tail, 66 mm. ; length 
to rictus oris, 10 ram. 

This species has a strong resemblance to the species of Storeria, and 
is placed in that genus by Boulenger, on account of the equality in the 
length of the teeth. It is found in the southern part of the plateau, 
and, according to Boulenger, in the highlands of Jalisco.

' Hemipenis undivided and with simple sulcus spermaticus ; no papillte.

This genus includes true Natricimie with simple penis, divided anal 
plate, and smooth pitless scales. In one or the other of these characters 
it differs from all the genera of Natricinie. It will be necessary to dis- 
cover whether some of the smooth-scaled snakes of other countries 
referred by Boulenger to Tropidonottis, do not belong to Seminatrix. 

But one species is known from the Medicolumbian fauna, which is 
thus characterized : 

Scales in seventeen series ; superior labials, eight; body compressed posteriorly; black 
above, red below ; small S. pygcea Cope.

This species was discovered by Edward Tatnall, of Wilmington, Del- 
aware, at Volusia, Florida. Since then others have been found at 
various points in the peninsula, among others at I^ake Tarr, whence 
specimens have been sent to the Philadelpliia Zoological Garden. 

Without examining the vertebrje I originally referred this si)ecies to 
Contia, as its smooth scales did not suggest reference to the water 
snakes. Subsecjuently Dr. Boulenger, in the Catalogue of Snakes in 
the British Museum, placed it in Tropi(}o)toi^t^. To determine the 
question by the penial test I later examined the male organ and found 
that Dr. Boulenger's estimate of its affinities was entirely correct. I, 
however, think its peculiarities entitle- it to generic separation from 

Concerning this species Dr. Einar Loennberg' says: 

I liave l)ut riirely found this little snake ont of water, and in such cases only under 
some log or board mar the water's edy^e. It is common around the borders of the 
small lakes in Orange County, where 1 have seen and caught specimens in I^ake 
Eola, Orlando, in and around some snuill lakes near ("larcona, Toronto, Apopka, and 
other places.

The number of supralabials is variable. In most cases there are 
eight, but I have two specimens with only seven, and one with only six 
on one side. In these cases of reduction the posterior ones have become 
fused, as is shown by their size and the frequent presence of an incom-

Head distinct from the body. Cephalic plates normal. Loreal plate 
absent. Orbitals posterior and anterior. Nasals two. Body subcylin- 
drical; tail comparatively short, tapering. Dorsal scales carinated. 
Anal scutum bifid. Subcaudals divided. Teeth small, numerous, of 
equal lengths, ungrooved. 

This genus is a reduced type of Natrix, to which it is connected by 
tbe Mexican K storerioides Cope. Its range is nearctic, extending 
south as far as the plateau of Vera Paz and Guatemala. 

There are three species of the genus, which differ as follows : 

Oculars 1-2; seven upper labials, the posterior wide; nostril between nasals; belly- 
grayish white ; a black spot below orbit S. dekayi. 

Oculars 1-2; six upper labials, the posterior narrow; nostril between nasals; no 
black spot below orbit; belly grayish white S. tropica.^ 

Oculars 2-2; five or six upper labials, the posterior narrow; nostril in anterior 
nasal ; no dark spot below orbit ; belly red S. occipitomaculata. 

S. tropica agrees with the 8. dekayi Holbrook, excepting in two 
points. It has but six superior labials. The diminution in the number 
is posterior to the orbit, and the fifth and sixth scuta are of a different 
form from those of the >S^. delcayi. They are longer and less elevated. 
The second character is in the color. This species lacks the dark 
mark that descends from the orbit to the superior labial margin in the 
8. delmyi.

wide as liigh, obtusely rounded, visible from above. Internasals wider 
tliau long. Frontal with lateral and anterior borders straight and 
about equal, twice as wide as each superciliary. Tarietals longer than 
wide, truncate posteriorly. Nostril partially in the prenasal. Tem- 
porals 1-2, the first extending to middle of last superior labial. Seven 
upper labials on each side. Lower labials seven, of which the fourth 
and fifth are very large, extending quite to the mental. A second 
plate parallel with the sixth, rather longer. Pregeneials longer than 
postgeneials; the latter bounded behind by the generally undivided 
first gastrostege, which is separated from the labials by one row of 
scales. Exterior row of scales largest, rest diminishing gradually to 
the back; all keeled, the first weakly. 

Color grayish brown, sometimes chestnut-brown above and on the 
sides, with a dorsal stripe extending from occij)ut to the end of the tail, 
of a decidedly lighter tint, and about three and two half-scales in width. 
This is bordered along each outer edge by a series of rounded brown 
dots, occurring at intervals of about two scales; of these there are

about seventy pairs from occiput to anus. Each dot occupies gener- 
ally a single scale, but is sometimes seen on the skin on each side. On 
separating the scales, the skin on each side of the fourth lateral row of 
scales exhibits a second series, similar to and alternating with the first. 
A third series, opposite to the first and alternating with the second, is 
seen along the second row, and there are even traces of a fourth 
between the abdominal and first dorsal series. Of these only the first- 
mentioned series is visible under ordinary circumstances, and is gen- 
erally only to be made out on separating the scales, the color only occa- 
sionally being shown on their margins, The first pair of dots just 
behind and across the angle of the jaw is enlarged into a crescentic 
patch, concave before. A second narrow vertical patch of black across 
the sides of the head, anterior to a point halfway between the first and 
the eye; this sometimes interrupted in the middle. The posterior mar- 
gins of the third and fourth (sometimes the second) labials black, show- 
ing two vertical lines below the orbit. Plates on toj) of head mottled 
chestnut-brown.

In some specimens the brown of the sides increases in depth to the 
dorsal stripe. In some, too, a transverse bar connects the lateral spots 
across the back. 

In a very young specimen from Grosse He, the colors are dark chest- 
nut above, with the interval between the occipital patches and the 
cephalic plates and orbit white, crossed by a vertical black line on the 
angle of the mouth. 

Measurements. — Length, 4^ inches. 

Anomalies in the scutellation of this species sometimes occur. The 
most frequent is the longitudinal division of the first abdominal scutum, 
which then forms a third pair of geneial i)lates. This character has been 
made the basis of the variety " anomala^^ of Duges.' It occurs in Cat. 
Nos. 1860, 2215, 4918, 6474, U. S. National Museum. In Cat. No. 2275 
there are two preoculars on each side. In Cat. No. 1860 there is a 
small superior postnasal on one side. 

This species is distributed throughout the entire eastern and aus- 
troriparian regions of North America as far west as Kansas. South- 
ward it extends into Mexico on the table-land, and to the State of Vera 
Cruz. The largest specimens come from about New Orleans. 

Like its allies of the Natriciuie, the Storeria del'ayi is viviparous. It 

is abundant and is gentle in disposition, making no attempt to bite. 

It is entirely terrestrial in its habits, and I have never known it to be 

found near water.

This species is not readily exterminated by the increase of popula- 
tion; its fecundity, obscure colors, and small size protecting it. A 
vacant lot on the outskirts of Philadelphia has been noted as a place 
for finding them, and the boys that know can generally procure speci- 
mens there when they are desired.

Color above light chestnut-brown, sometimes chestnut- gray, at others 
olivaceous; a paler vertebral line from occiput to end of tail, about 
three scales in width; on each side of this maybe seen a series of 
minute brown spots, produced by the brown bases of the scales in the 
third row on each side from the central series. Sometimes the brown 
covers the whole scale, and gives rise to two dorsal lines; at others it 
is almost entirely wanting, and this, connected as it generally is with 
a less distinct vertebral band, gives the impression of a uniform tint 
above. Upper margin of the exterior dorsal lines brighter yellowisb, 
giving the effect in some cases of a lateral narrow light line. Abdo- 
men in life salmon-color, in alcohol whitish yellow, with the sides finely 
mottled with dark-brown, sometimes obsoletely, at others constituting 
very distinct bands. These generally do not encroach upon the dorsal 
scales. Occasionally, however, the middle of the exterior row of scales 
exhibits a dark stripe. Immediately behind the occipital plates, and 
on the median line, is seen a dull salmon-colored blotch, on each side

of which, over the angle of the jaws, is a similar smaller one. The 
intervals between these blotches sometimes darker. A small salmon- 
colored spot on the fourth or fifth upper labial, behind the orbit. Plates 
on the top of the head blotched with darker. Lower jaw minutely 
dotted with brown. 

The following description of a living specimen caught at Westport, 
New York, August, 1847, is from Prof. S. F. Baird's manuscripts : 

Iris dark chestnut, rather lighter above and externally. General color above dnll 
chestnut-brown. Attentively examined, however, when wet, there is seen a faiut 
dorsal stripe of lighter color, bordered by a line on each side of darker, which fades 
off to the abdominal scutelhe until the color is the same as the dorsal line, or even 
lighter. Behind the liead are three light yellowish brown occipital spots. Whole 
under parts, except the chin or throat, briglit brick-red. Chin and throat white, 
mottled finely with gray and black, like pepper and salt. An irregularly defined 
stripe of the same mottling along the sides, from head to anus, crossing the abdom- 
inal scutella; near the outside. 

A strongly marked variety is seen in individuals from Charleston and 
Anderson, South Carolina, in which the body is dark slate- blue, except 
the middle third of the abdomen, w^hich is yellowish white. The dorsal 
lines of black dots are visible through the ground color; the lateral

lighter Hue is scarcely perceptible. The three occipital spots, and that 
on the labials, are distinct. 

Another variety is seen in a specimen ironi Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, 
where, in addition to the coloration just mentioned, the vertebral stripe 
is light chestnut, contrasting strongly with the ground-color. 

Another specimen which I found at Johnsonburg, Elk County, Penn- 
sylvania, in a rugged region, is a very dark brown with the dorsal band 
obscure and thennder surfaces black. The throat aiul chin are whitish, 
and the black is darkest in a row of spots on each side of a dozen 
anterior gastrosteges.

This small snake is generally distributed in the Eastern and Austro- 
riparian regions, having about the same range as the S. delayi. It 
extends south also to Vera Cruz, Mexico. It is less common in the 
United States than the ^. deJiai/i, but I have found it more abundant in 
western Massachusetts. Like its congener, it is entirely inoftensive, 
and is found on the ground and in the woods in dry places.

VIRGINIA Baird and Girard. 

Virginia Baird and Girard, Cat. N. Amer. Rept., Pt. 1, Serp., 1853, p. 127. — Cope, 
Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., No. 32, 1887, p. 53; Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XIV, 1892, 
p. 599.— BouLENGER, Cat. Snakes Brit. Mus., II, 1894, p. 288. 

Head subelliptical, distinct from the body. Cephalic plates normal. 
Two nasals; posterior one not invaded by the nostril, Postfrontals 
and loreal entering into the orbit, and suppressing the anteorbitals. 
Superciliaries well developed. Mental scutelhe two pairs. Pupil cir- 
cular. Scales smooth. Postabdominal scutella bifid. Subcaudal scuta 
all divided. 

The distinctness of the head from the neck, and the relatively narrow 
frontal plate in this genus, resemble conditions common in the Hatric- 
iune. The lateral head scuta are like those of Rhahdosoma and its 
immediate allies. 

But two species are known : 

Scales wide, in 15 rows V. valerice 

Scales narrow, in 17 rows V. eJegans 

These species occur in both the Eastern and Austroriparian districts, 
the V. elegans in the western part of the latter only. The former has 
not yet been found north of the Carolinian division of the eastern 
district.

two scales, differing in different specimens. On tbe fourth row of scales 
on each side is another row of specks which are separated by spaces of 
two scales length. The top of the head posterior to the prefrontals is 
more or less speckled with dark brown. Labial scuta immaculate.

The specimens show considerable variation in the number of the 
postocular scuta. Thus in two specimens from Fort Towson, Arkansas 
(Cat. Xo. 2055), there are three on each side; in Cat. Ko. 12023, from 
Mount Carmel, Illinois, there are two on each side, and in Cat. No. 
13632, from Helotes, Texas, the two are fused into a large one on each 
side. 

The differences between this species and the V. valericv are restricted 
to the form and number of the scales. Beyond these I have not been 
able to detect any.

AMPHIARDIS Cope. 



Jmphiardts Cope, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XI, 1888, p. 391. — Boulenger, Cat. 
Snakes Brit. Mus., 1, 1893, p. 290. 

Head not distinct; teeth equal. Scales keeled; anal and subcaudal 
scuta divided. Cephalic scuta of upper surface normal. Eostral not 
prominent; two iuternasals. Two nasals, one loreal which extends to 
the orbit. No preocular. Pupil round. 

This genus embraces, as yet, but a single si)ecies. It is most nearly 
allied to Haldea, from which i t differs only in the presence of two inter- 
nasal plates. The species is little known.

Mus., XI, 1888, ]). .391.— BOULENGER, Cat. Snakes Brit. Mus., 1, 1893, p. 290. 

The following description is copied from Garinau : 

Moderately stout, slightly <lepresseil; head small, not distinct from the neck, 
subconical; tail short, tapering to a point. Snout short, blunt. Eye moderate. 
Nostrils anterior, directed horizontally in the anterior portion of the divided nasal. 
Nine head shields. Rostral very small, not reaching the top of the head. Two 
internasals (loft smaller in each specimen). Loreal elongate, with the prefrontal 
forming the anterior border of the orbit. Prefrontals as broad as long. One post- 
orbital. Temporals 1+1. Labials live, third and fourth in orbit, fifth largest. 
Infralabials six, fifth largest. Posterior submentals half as large as the anterior. 
Scales cariuate, lustrous, in seventeen rows ; dorsal narrow ; outer broad and faintly 
keeled; ventrals 125-129. Anal divided. Subcaudals thirty-six pairs. 

Uniform brownish olive on the dorsal rows. No band on the occiput. Ventrals 
whitish, tinged with olive on the bases. Largest specimen, total length 10 fV inches; 
tail IV'a inches. 

Two specimens of this species are known, both found near Dallas, in 
northern Texas. I have had the opportunity of examining them in the 
Museum of Comparative Zoology through the kindness of Dr. Agassiz 
and Mr. Garman. 

HALDEA Baird and Girard.

BouLENGER, Cat. Suakes Brit. Mus., 1, 1893, p. 290. 
Conocephalus Bibron, Prodrome des Ophidiens, 1853, p. 46. 

Head elongated, ellipsoid, distinct from the body. Iiiternasal plate 
single. Prefrontals large, entering together with the loreal into the 
orbit, thus suppressing the anteorbitals. Postorbital one. Two nasals. 
I *upil circular. Scales carinated. Postabdominal scutella bifid. Sub- 
caudals divided. 

This genus has the form and probably the habits of theCalamarinie, 
but the continuity of the vertebral hypapophyses throughout the ver- 
tebral column and the characters of the hemipenis indicate that its affini- 
ties are with the Natricina?, of which group it is probably a degenerate 
offshoot.

ing the postnasal and upper part of the orbit, liostral tapering 
upward. jSTostril opening in the posterior margin of the prenasal 
plate. Loreal elongated, situated above the second and third labials, 
and forming, with the postfrontal, the anterior part of the orbit. Eyes 
circular. Superciliaries proportionally large. One angular postorbital, 
elevated, the fourth labial forming the lower portion of the posterior 
part of the orbit. Temporal shields of medium size. Mouth deeply 

cleft. Upper labials five ; fourth 
and fifth very large. Inferior 
labials six; fifth disproportion- 
ally the largest. 

Body slender, subcylindrical; 
tail short, and very much taper- 
ing. Scales lanceolated, in sev- 
enteen rows, all carinated, very 
narrow along the back; outer 
row conspicuously broader, with 
an obsolete carination. 

Grayish brown above, soiled 
yellow beneath (said to be red- 
dish gray above, and salmon-colored beneath, in life), a narrow light 
chestnut band across the middle of the occipitals, spreading over the 
angle of the mouth. 

This small species is distributed over the Austroriparian district, and 
extends into the Eastern, but how far is as yet unknown. Fort Jackson, 
Minnesota, is the most northern locality in the following list, but for 
its accuracy I can not vouch. Eichmond, Virginia, is the most north- 
ern locality in the East.

Head not distinct from body. Teeth equal. Scales keeled; anal 
plate entire; subciiudal scuta divided. Cephalic scuta normal; two 
iiiteniasals, rostral not prominent. One nasal and one loreal. 
Hemip.enis with two apical papilla". 

This genus shows its position to be in the Natricina^ by the presence 
of the vertebral hypapophyses on the posterior part of the column. 
In its entire anal i)late, and in its pattern of coloration, it resembles 
the genus J^Jntcvnia, and especial!}' such species as IJ. hrachysionia Cope 
and E. leptocephala Baird and Girard, where the head is not very dis- 
tinct. It is probably a terrestrial modification of that genus, as the 
Natri.r /cirtlandii is oi Xatrix. But one species of the genus is known. 
The peculiar apical papilhc of the hemipenis I find to be entirely 
constant.

The head is quite sma^.l, rounded above, depressed in front; snout 
subacute; nostril in a single parallelogrammic nasal plate, quite near 
its superior margin, and 
much nearer its anterior 
than its j)osterior ex- 
tremity; sometimes this 
plate is cleft inferiorly 
below the nostril; loreal 
longer than high; one 
anterior, two posterior 
orbitals; six superior la- 
bials, the eye resting on 
the third and fourth, the 
sixth longer than high.

bounding the x»osterior part of the long fourth inferior labial. Body 
rather stout, thicker in the middle, covered with nineteen rows of 
scales, all of which are very strongly carinated, except the two inferior 
rows, which are quite smooth and deeper than the others; other scales 
narrow, subelliptical, bipuuctate posteriorly, the carina reaching the

scuta, 138; subcaudals, 34; a single preanal. 

Brown above, with three narrow yellow dorsal vittse, the middle 
occupying one row and a half of the adjoining row of scales; head 
above brown; upper jaw light yellow; abdomen and under part of tail 
yellow, with a double row of triangular spots of a bluish-black color 
along the middle of the former and base of the latter; these spots are 
sometimes confluent at their bases; the spots beneath the epidermis 
are perfectly black. 

This species is especially characteristic of the western part of the 
Mississippi Valley, occurring in the western part of the Eastern, and 
the Texan part of the Austroriparian subregions. It is not uncommon 
in northern Texas, the Indian Territory, and southern Kansas, extend- 
ing north to Iowa and Ohio, inclusive.

Mr. Julius Hurter, to whom I owe much information respecting the 
reptiles of Missouri, states that this species is very abundant within 
the city limits of St. Louis. A flood in the Mississippi at one time 
drove them from their subterranean haunts and many were captured.

scales. 

It includes but one species, which has been found so far in Florida 
only.

rhomboid, posterior angle rounded, transverse diameter the greater; 
postfrontals six-sided, the smaller next the loreal, rounded angle 
backward; vertical moderate, six-angled, narrower forward; supercili- 
aries shorter than the vertical, five sided, narrow, wider above the post-

Color in longitudinal bands; the vertebral dark brown, five scales 
and two half scales in width, extending over the head to the upper por- 
tions of the rostral and labials; the first laterals of yellowish brown, 
from the occiput, two half scales wide; the second of dark brown, two 
scales and.two halves; the exterior of brownish yellow, two scales and 
a half. The darker lateral edges of all the scales give the api)earaiice 
of narrow stripes. Abdominals, subcaudals, lower part of head, upper 
labials, and rostral dull yellow or straw cglor. Without spots. It is 
likely that in life the dark bands were purplish or bluish and the light 
flesh colored.

Cephalic jilates normal; two nasals, one loreal. Eye resting on 
superior labials. Scales keeled, without pores. Anal plate entire; sub- 
caudals divided. The maxillary teeth are rather abruptly longer near 
the posterior extremity of the maxillary bone than elsewhere, as in the 
genus Natrix, with two exceptions. These are the species E. multimac- 
nlata Cope and E. melanogaster Wiegmann. I have on this account dis- 
tinguistied these species as constituting another genus which I called 
Atomarchus, the character distinguishing it from Eutamia being the 
equality in length of the maxillary teeth. As the excess in length of 
the posterior teeth is small in some of the species of the latter, I have 
not for the present retained this genus, although it may be found to be 
advisable to do so hereafter. The two species mentioned are more 
aquatic in their habits than the EutiTBuite proper. 

This genus was established by Baird and Girard in the Catalogue of 
Serpents of North America, published in 1853, on species which had 
been previously referred to the genus Natrix (Tropidonotus). To the 
three species previously known these authors added four; and nine 
names were proposed for what are in my estimation either subspecies 
or individuals of the seven species actually distinguished. In the year 
1800 Keunicott added five species. At various dates between 1860 and 
1885 the present writer added nine species, and referred to the genus a 
species long previously described by Wiegmann. In 1890 Brown added 
a species, and a species is described for the first time in the present 
review. The total number of si^ecies is, then, twenty-four. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SXAKES. 1015 

Eutii'niffi are the most abundant suakes in North America and .Mex- 
ico. Where all other species are absent, either through hostility of 
the climate or of enemies, individuals of this genus remain. This i^er- 
sistence may be ascribed to several causes. One of these is their great 
fecundity. Professor Baird -mentions a specimen of E. sirtalis which 
produced eighty young at a birth. Another cause is their readiness to 
seek concealment in water, so that they most readily escape observation. 

Several of the sij^ecies are pugnacious in their disposition. Siich is 
the case with the two which have the widest distribution and greatest 
abundance of individuals, the U. sirtaUs Linnams and JE'. cleyans Baiid 
and Girard. Their bite, it is needless to remark, is perfectly harmless. 
Some of the species possess great elegance of form, as those of the E. 
satirita group. Others have much brilliancy of color, as the metallic 
green of some forms of the E. proxima and the red and black of the 
E. sirtaUs concinna. 

The genus Enttenia presents especial attractions to the student who 
desires an illustration of the phenomena of variation and constancy in 
the physical characters of animals. In few genera do we And so well 
illustrated the jjersistence of specific characters exhibited side by side 
with variations of the same. We have here, therefore, examples of 
the appearance or disapi)earance, as the case may be, of characters in 
connection with or without apparent connection with the environment. 

The species of Eutcenia differ as follows:

The E. sirtalis present.s the greatest number of points of contact with 
other species. It also inhabits the region of geological]}^ the greatest 
age, or that region which lias been a frog land area for the longest 
time. Although large portions of the west of Xorth America were ele- 
vated at the close of the Cretaceous period, and probably before the 
genus Eutwnia was in existence, the ancestors of Eutcenia may be 
safely believed to have inhabited the area which was land prior to the 
Cretaceons. so that the descent of Eutwnia was new and possibly in the 
eastern rather than in the western half of the continent. It is thus 
rendered probable that Eutivnia sirtalis is the ancestral form. This is 
also conlirmed by the fact that it is a spotted .species, since the unicolor 
species, as E. saurita, have spotted young.

The above table gives but a very general view of the distribution of 
the species, siuce some of them are restricted to districts of the regions 
only, while a few species are known from so few examples that their 
range is unknown. Of the latter class are U. butlerii, E. hr achy stoma,, 
E. rutiloris, E. angustirostris, and E. nigrilatus. The E. sackenii is 
restricted to Florida, and the E. radix to that part of the central 
region that lies east of the Rocky Mountains, entering the eastern 
region. The widely distributed species, as E. sirtalis and E. elegans, 
are represented in special districts by peculiar subspecies, which look 
very different from each other. The E. proxima has a rauge which 
does not coincide with any zoological district, inhabiting eastern 
Mexico, Texas, and the Mississippi Valley. 

The study of the several hundred si^ecimens of species of this genus 
which are contained in the TJ. S. National Museum and my private collec- 
tion shows that in most of the species the number of rows of scales and 
the number of the labial plates are quite constant. In only one species, 
the E. leptocephala, is the number of scale rows varied by the i^res- 
ence or absence of a single row on each side, and in none is the 
number of labial plates frequently variable. The position of the lateral 
stripe is, as stated by Baird and Girard, very constant. The relative 
length of the tail is constant within certain limits and in certain 
species. In some of the species it varies a good deal. The coloration 
varies within limits in each species, and often characterizes subspecies 
with considerable precision, transitional forms in some such cases being 
rare and in others more frequent. The species of the Pacific coast 
present the greatest difficulties to the systematist. Here the eastern 
E. sirtalis comes into contact with the western E. elegans, and some 
close parallels in coloration occur. Thus the E. s. parietalis resembles 
very much the E. elegans ordinoidcs, and the E. s. sirtalis resembles 
considerably the E. c. lineolata. Tlie E. infernalis intervenes between

the E. sirtalis aud E. elegans iu scale formula'. The E. leptocephala 
appears quite distinct from the southern west coast forms, but it has 
melanistic phases which resemble melauistic forms of the E. nirtalis 
from the northwest coast in Washington, such as E. s. piclceringii. 

The colors of the young atford some clew to the order of probable 
appearance of color marks in the adults. As already remarked by 
Baird aud Girard, the spots are more distinct in the young than in 
adults, both as to isolation from each other and in distinctness of color. 
When spots disa])pear and are rei)laced by a uniform tint, both lighter 
{E. elegans vagrans) and darker {E. elegans Uneolata and E. sirtalis 
ohscura), the change first appears on the posterior part of the body. 
The tendency to form cross- bars or spots appears first on the anterior 
I)art of the body. This is slightly developed in the E. sirtalis semifas- 
ciata but extends throughout the greater part of the length in the 
E. phenav. In species in which the top of the head is pale, as E. ele- 
gans vagrans, it is very dark or black in the young. This dark color is 
paler also in the E. e. couch ii, and in the E, e. marciana, but leaves its 
posterior portion as a pair of large black nuchal spots.

and sometimes these also disappear. In the type specimen the dorsal 
stripe is represented by a half-inch posterior to the head; no spots or 
markings on the gastrosteges. 

In seven specimens the proportion of the tail to the total length is 
as follows: Cat. No. 10589, two and three-fourths, two and four-fifths; 
Cat. No. 10693, two and four-fifths; Cat. No. 11987, two and five-sixths, 
two and nine-tenths, two and nine-tenths; Cat. No. 12590, three. 

This species is distributed over Florida generally, and ranges as far 
westward as Mobile, Alabama, from which point specimens were sent 
me by my friend. Dr. Joseph Corson, United States Army. It is the 
most slender species of the genus, and is characterized by the form of 
the first row of scales. These are narrow, differing very little from 
those of the other rows. Like them they are strongly keeled, and are 
notched at the apex. The form originally described has no dorsal 
stripe. Specimens of this kind were sent me from Volusia. Specimens 
from Georgiana, belonging to the U. S. National Museum, and from 
Mobile have a dorsal stripe with blackish borders. Two Volusia speci- 
mens have seven superior labials, while one has eight. Two specimens 
from Mobile have eight superior labials, and ten from other i)arts of 
Florida have the same. In one of the specimens from Georgiana the 
colors, including the stripes, are obscure.

A series of small spots aloug' the superior edge of the lateral stripe 
is seen in the only young specimen in the collection. 

The seven superior labials and the color distinguish this species from 
the E, sackenii. The carination of the scales is also not so strong as in 
the latter. 

The FjUtaMiia sanrlta ranges the eastern and austroriparian districts, 
except Florida and Texas. Specimens in Yarrow's Check-list said to 
be from the latter districts belong to the E. sackenii and E. proxima, 
respectively. It is especially abundant in the Middle States, but is not 
known to extend north of Massachusetts. It is an elegant creature, 
and is generally found near water, in which it swims readily, being 
more aquatic in its habits than the E. sirfalis, which is found in the 
same localities.

the mouth of the llio Grande, and in eastern Mexico as far south as 
Orizaba. The individuals from the Mississijipi Valley from New 
Orleans to Indiana and Wisconsin are generally blacker above than 
Texan specimens, and they have been regarded as a distinct species 
under the name of IJ. faireyi. This is, however, only a melanistic phase 
of the U.proxima. Specimens occur in my collection from Dallas, Texas, 
and another black one in the U. S. National Museum comes from so far 
west as Fort McKavett, which formerly stood on the Upper Llano Kiver. 

Besides the shorter tail, this species is readily known from the two 
species just before described, by the increased difference in form between 
the scales of the first and those of the other rows. Their form is dis- 
tinctly different from that of the latter, but the diversity is not so great 
as in the JE/. radix and other species which follow. 

A remarkable variety of this species comes from Fort Stockton, 
Texas. A pale shade represents the dorsal stripe, and the generally 
green colors are metallic in tbeir luster. (Cat. No. 5180.) The propor- 
tions and scales are entirely normal.

The Eutmnia megahps connects the species of the E. saurita group 
with the ordinary types of the genus with the larger number of lateral 
plates and dorsal scales. It is confined to our southwestern border and 
to the northern part of Mexico. It is evidently the most abundant 
snake in Chihuahua. The large number of specimens sent from near 
the city of that name display very little variation, and agree with one 
from New Mexico, described by me as above. The lateral band gener- 
ally occupies only the third row of scales, but sometimes borders the 
fourth. The dorsal band very frequently occupies but one row of 
scales, but occasionally covers the halves of the adjacent rows. Cat.

Form rather robust, tail less than one-fourth the total length. Head 
moderately distinct, muzzle rather short, eye not enlarged. Scales in 
twenty-one longitudinal row.s; the inferior row as deep as long, smooth 
or nearly so, and not at all or very feebly notched at the apex. Scales 
of second row not very strongly keeled, and feebly or not notched. 
Scales of other rows more elongate, strongly keeled, and feebly or not 
notched. Internasals and i)refrontals wider than long; frontal much 
wider than superciliaries, much shorter than i)arietals. Loreal small, 
as high as long; oculars, 1-3. Temporals, 1-2-3. Superior labials 
seven, all higher than long except the first and .seventh. Inferior 
labials nine; postgeneials larger than pregeiieials. 

Color different shades of brown, with three longitudinal light-yellow 
stripes. The latter occupy more or less of the third and fourth rows

of scales on each side, and the median row witli the adjacent halva^s of 
the adjacent rows. The brown si)ace between the stripes is marked by 
two alternating rows of square blackish spots, and a single similar row 
marks the brown ground below the lateral stripe. Belly greenish 
white; each gastrostege with a black spot near the lateral extremity, 
extending various distances from the base. The superior labial plates 
are bordered posteriorly with black, sometimes narrowly, sometimes 
broadly. The color of the sides is continued onto the head, without the 
isolation of the anterior portion as a black spot on each side of the 
nape. Sometimes the superior 
labials are bordered with black 
posterior to the postoculars, 
sometimes not. 

In twenty-nine specimens I 
have found three with eight su- 
perior labials on one side, and 
two with eight on both sides. 
In eighteen specimens I have 
found one with nineteen rows of 
scales, and this one is the type 
of Baird and Girard's original 
description. 

This is a species of the central 
]>lains, not i)assing the Eocky 

Mountains to the west. It extends south as far as Dallas, Texas, and 
north into Canada, and east to Lake Michigan and Ohio, exclusive. 

There are three color forms of this species which do not differ suffi- 
ciently to deserve distinction as subsi)ecies. The species from northern 
localities, including the type, are dark colored, the ground color obscur- 
ing the spots, which can be, nevertheless, always discerned. Southern 
individuals are much lighter colored, the ground being a light olive, 
so that the spots l)oth above and below the lateral stripe are very dis- 
tinct, and the lateral stripe is little contrasted. The third form, repre- 
sented by two specimens from Indiana, is also brightly colored, and the 
spots on the ends of the gastrosteges are prolonged posteriorly so as to 
form a black stripe on each side of the abdomen ; but this is interrupted, 
the stripe being only continuous in sections, including from two to five 
scuta. 

The first of these color forms includes the type specimen, which has, 
however, the stripes a little narrower than usual, and has the peculiarity 
of having only nineteen rows of scales. To the average typical form 
the name E. radix ticinhuiii Cones and Yarrow, has been given. The 
second form is the JEutcvnia Itaydeiiii Kennicott. The other is the U. r. 
melanotwnla Cope.

Dr. Henry Brous thus writes of the habits of the Eutcvnia radix: ' 

Several of the sninmers I passed upoa the plaius were preceded by rainy springs, 
awelliug to unusual height the small streams, which became inhabited by small fishes. 
During the drought of hot summers the receding waters left the fishes in shallow 
pools witbiu creek bods, an easy prey to their numerous enemies. 

The midday heat caused numbers of snakes to seek shelter from the suu, and the 
garter snake ^ /i/'wto'w m radix) in particular chose water at this time. Here the fislics. 
unable to escape or to find deep water, were unwilling cotenants with the 8ual<i8. 
The latter are fond of fish, and would devour groat numbers of the smaller ones, 
chasing them from one part of the shallow pool to another. When the fishes were 
in water too shallow to swim in, or were struggling upon the sand, they would be 
seized by the snakes, who would feed upon them until unable to contain more. The 
snakes would follow the fish through the water, diving and remaining submerged 
sometime. I did not observe them swallow air (see Am. Nat., Jan., 1880). Snalies

Mr. J. L. Wortnian, who had charge of a scientific party last year, informs hh- that 
while lishing one day he caught numbers of chub (Cj/prinida') and, throwing them 
on the sand, was suri>rised to see that bnt few remained. While quietly continuing 
to rcplact^ tliose so singularly missing, he observed a garter snake seize and swallow 
one of the fish ti inches in length. There were two of these snakes reaping the 
reward of Mr. Wortman's skill. Upon opening the snakes one was fonnd to contain 
six lishcis. Tile head waters of the Smoky Hill and Big Horn rivers abound in this 
aquatic i'lita tiia radix.

known from the valley of Mexico. I took three specimens at the lake 
of Xochimilco and at Chapultepec, and Dr. Duges sent me a fourth 
from Guanajuato. Mr. Bocourt sent a fifth from some part of Mexico to 
the National Museum. These all differ from the type of E. mavro.stemma, 
which is also from the valley of Mexico, in the general indistinctness 
of their markings and in the absence of the parietal spots. On loss 
of the epidermis the markings come out, except the parietal spots. 

This is a water snake in its habits, but spends much of its time on 
the banks. My friend, Mr. Julius Flohr, of the City of Mexico, took 
me ou a boating excursion on the lake of Xochimilco, near that city, 

and I had the opportunity 
of observing the habits of 
this snake and of compar- 
ing them with those of the 
U. melanogaster, which in- 
habits the same locality. 
On being disturbed, the E. 
macrostemma plunges into 
the water, but does not go 
far beneath the surface, 
but takes refuge under 
the edge of the bank, or 
emerges in a new spot, so 
that it is not difficult of 
capture. When a p - 
proached or caught it is 
very pugnacious. The 
habits of the E. melano- 
gaster are different. It, too, lies on the bank, but when it plunges it 
dives to the bottom and so effectually conceals itself that it can not be 
captured on that occasion. When caught it is much less i)ugnacious 
than the E. macrostemma. The columns that support the aqueduct 
that carries water from Chapultepec to the City of Mexico are covered 
with a dense vegetation, which is continuously watered by leaks in the 
venerable structure. On examining this vegetation at my height above 
the ground, I encountered in the thick of it a round eye. Exposure 
revealed first the head and then the body of a snake of this species, 
which found a congenial abode in that position. 

This is the species which appears on the arms of Mexico. Tradition 
states that Cortes adopted the arms after observing an esigle {Poly- 
horns) sieze a water snake and carry it to a large cactus {Opuntia) iu 
its talons.^ 

I have seen this brightly colored form from Guanajuato (Duges) ; Mex- 
ico ( Hoeje), and Vera Cruz (Sartorius and the Geographical Commission).

Scales in uiueteeti lougitudinal rows, the inferior much the widest and

the second large, extending from parietal to labials. Oculars, 1-3.

very little distinct, muzzle conical, a little protuberant; eye uot large. 
Ground color above, olive brown, which is marked by the usual three 
longitudinal yellowish 
bands. The median 
covers one and two half 
rows of scales, and the 
lateral covers the sec- 
ond, third, and fourth 
rows. Both are black 
bordered on both edges, 
the border of the latter 
band interrupted. The 
segments of the supe- 
rior border of the lateral 
band represent the in- 
ferior spots of the lateral series; the superior row is wanting from the 
scales. Gastrosteges and urosteges olive, yellowish in front, dark 
behind, with a vertical black spot at the anterior border of each end of 
each of the gastrosteges. Labial scuta without black borders; head 
olive above, without markings, except two small, yellow, black-edged 
parietal spots in the usual position. 

I have seen but two vspecimens of this species, one of which belongs 
to the collection of Purdue University, at Lafayette, Indiana (Cat. No, 
264), and which is labeled as from Kichmond, Indiana. It is remark- 
ably distinct from everything which occurs in the United States, and has 
only superticial resemblances to the JJ. macrostemma Kennicott of Mex- 
ico. Its peculiar characters are the great width of the lateral color band, 
which covers three rows of scales, one more than in any other species; 
the black borders of the bauds; the abseuce of well-detined dorsal 
lateral spots, and the absence of markings on the head and labial 
scuta. Besides these color marks, the presence of a large second tem- 
l)oral plate extending to the labials is peculiar to this species, and the 
small number of inferior labials distinguishes it from the J'J. sirtaJis 
group; and the narrow conical head is characteristic. In the U. 
macrostemma the general appearance is somewhat similar, but the labial 
plates are broadly black edged, and the lateral band covers but two 
rows of scales ; there is a large postoral yellow dark-edged crescent, 
and the second temporal i)lare is smaller and does not reach the labials.

It is 14| inches long. It is short and chubby, and its movement is very charac- 
teristic of it. It does not have tbe gliding movement of E. sanrifa, nor tbe swilt 
and active movement of the Xatrlr sipedon, but seems rather to exert a lai ge amount 
of force to do little crawling. The movement is so characteristic that I believe any 
one having once seen the peculiar way in which it tries to hurry itself away would 
ever after be able to recognize it at a distance.

Of this species I have only two specimens, which agree in the follow- 
ing characters : They differ in the number of rows of scales, however, 
one having twenty-three and the other having twenty-two. All the 
rows of scales keeled, the median ones very strongly. Labials eight, 
the eye resting on the fourth and fifth. Two i^reoculars; three post- 
oculars. The muzzle is rather short, the frontal i)late exceeding in 
length the region anterior to it and equaling the common sutnrc of the 
l)arietal scuta. Nasals rather short; loreal as long as high; inferior 
pieocular nearly square; superior preocular not reaching frontal. 
Superior labials all truncate above and none of them elevated, the sixth 
touching the inferior postorbital. Temporals, 1-2-;}; tlie anterior ai-e 
rather large. Pairs of geneials subequal. Gastrosteges, one hundred 

'The EuUvnia ruUlons (Cope, Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc, 1885, p. 388) which is com- 
pared with the E. iutlerii in the analytical table of species, is from Cozumel Island, 
Yucatan. 

It resembles in coloration and in the keeled first row of scales the E. sackoii of 
Florida. It differs in the shorter tail, which is one-third the length in the E. sackeni, 
in the eight superior labials, and in the generally stouter proportions, .ns well as in 
the red lips. 

This species wan taken by tbe naturalists of the U. S. Fish Commission steamer 
Allifiiroxn on Cozumel Island, off tbe ca^t coast of Yucatan.

and fifty-six; iirosteges, seventy-iiiue. In the specimen with twenty- 
tliree rows of scales, tlie length of the tail enters the total four and two- 
sevenths times; in the one with twenty-one rows, it enters four and one- 
tenth times. 

Color everywhere black, except on the chin and throat and on tlie 
inferior side of the tail. The former was reddish in life. There are 
very faint traces of stri])es on the secoiul, third, and fourth, and on the 
median dorsal rows (»f scales. Marks of the lateral stripe are more evi- 
dent on the fourth than on the second rows of scales. No traces of 
spots on tlie i)arietal scuta. 

This species is allied to the U.elegans, from which it differs in its two 
l)reocular plates, iu the position of the lateral stripes, and, supposing 
the individuals to be adult, in its small size. The color is difi'erent 
from that of any of the forms referred to that species.

1034 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

The color is variable, but a more or less distinct lateral stripe is 
present in all excei)t the melauistic forms, ou the second and third rows 
of scales. lu all except the melauistic forms there is one row of lateral 
square spots above the lateral stripe, and in most there are two rows 
of spots. There are no well-detiiied markings on the abdominal scuta. 

The labial and sc;ile formulic in this species are quite constant. In 
two specimens of tlie E. e.plntonia the labials are eight, and the scales 
in twenty-one rows. In two of E.e.elegans the figures are the same. 
In one of 7!/\ e. hrnnnea the figures are the same. In eight of the E. e. 
lineolata the figures are the same. In four of the E. e. hanimondii the 
figures are the same except in one individual, where there are but 
nineteen rows of scales. In twenty-two specimens of E. e. vuf/rans 
there are twenty-one rows of scales in all, and in five specimens there 
are seven superior labials on one side. In one only are there seven 
superior labials on both sides. In all the others there are eight labials 
on both sides. In twelve specimens of E. c. marciana all have eight 
upper labials, and all but two twenty-one rows of scales. In the two 
the scales are in nineteen rows. Thus in fifty-one specimens there are 
three departures from the regular scale formula, and one entire depar 
ture and five partial departures from the labial formula. 

There are seven well marked color forms of this species, which mostly 
occupy distinct geographical regions, and are abundantly entitled to 
be called subspecies. It is indeed possible that some of them might 
be as well regarded as species, but the existence of transitions and the 
lack of importance in the characters themselves induce me to consider 
them as subspecies. They are, however, in the great majority of cases 
easily recognized. The characters of these forms are as follows: 

I. No spots; labials not dark borilered. 

Black above and below; no lateral baud; dorsal baud wanting or a trace in 

front only E. e. pluionia. 

Black above, ligbt below ; three distinct stripes, all black bordered ..E.e. elegans. 
Brown above, light below ; three distinct stripes, not black bordered . E. e. hrnnnea. 

II. Spotted; labials not dark bordered; nuchal spots indistinct. 

Stripes and spots distinct; the superior rowof spots confluent into a band; the 
inferior separated by chestnut-red spaces; belly olivaceous. £■. e. ordiiioides. 

Spots large anteriorly, small or confluent posteriorly; interspaces iudicated by 
pale edges of tlie scales; bands present, distinct E. e. Ihieolata. 

Spots small, 80-100; interspaces large, pale; bands present, often indistinct; belly 
with dark middle E. e. vagrans. 

III. Spotted; labials dark bordered; nuchal spots more or less distinct. 

No dorsal band; lateral baml indistinct; intermediate space lead colored, with 
one row of spots next to the lateral band ; yellow marks behind eye incom- 
plete ; spots, 74-90 E. e. coitchii. 

Dorsal and lateral bands indistinct; three rows of spots, light ground on each 
side, 50-60 in each row ; two yellow crescents extending upward at angle of 
mouth and behind eye E.e. marciana. 

Of these subspecies the E. e. liliitonia has been found rarely and at 
remote localities, and the E. e. hrnnnea is only known from one speci- 
men, so that these can not be yet regarded as geographical forms. The 



CKOCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 1035 

E. c. e1e(/ans has been found so far in northern and central California 
only. The IJ. e. Uneolata is from the same region and from Oregon and 
Washington as well. The E. e. vayrans is characteristic of the entire 
region between the Sierra Xevada on the west and the eastern border 
of the Great Plains on the east, and belongs to higher parts of the 
llocky Mountain ranges as well as to the valleys between them. Tlie 
E. c. hainmondii is characteristic of southern California and southern 
Arizona and New Mexico. The E. e. marciana belongs to the valley 
of the Rio Grande and adjacent regions in Texas and Mexico. It is 
seen from the above that the EnUvnia elegann inhabits all of the Xearc- 
tic realm excepting the eastern region. 

As regards transitions between the subspecies, they will be men- 
tioned under their respectiv^e heads. I refer now to the number of the 
sjjots in each dorsal row which they present. In E. e. vagrans this 
extends from eighty-four to one hundred and three in six specimens in 
which I counted them. In E. e. marciana they range from fifty-two to 
fifty-eight in four specimens, while there are seventy-three in an other- 
wise typical specimen. We have here a considerable interval between 
the ranges. This is tilled up by the E. e. couchii, where they run from 
seventy-four to ninety-one in five specimens. The number of spots is 
then tolerably constant, but insufficient to enable us to define species. 

I have endeavored to ascertain whether there is any constancy in the 
number of temporal scales in them. Thus, in the typical form, E. e. 
defjans, there are three rows of scales bordering the i)ostorbital supe- 
rior labials above, while in the E. e. Uneolata there are as often four as 
three. In one of the latter (Cat. No. 10848) there are, however, but 
three rows. In the E. e. ragrans five specimens have four rows and five 
have three rows. In the E. e. liammondii three have three rows and one 
(Cat. No. 8G6) has four. In the specimens of E. e. marciana, seven have 
three, and three have four. The rows alwaj^s have the formula 1-2-3-4.

In the tyj)e of this subspecies (Cat. No. 10912) there is a very faint 
trace of dorsal and lateral bands. Thegular region is lead colored, or a

Head short, broad. Upper labial plates higher than long. Eyes 
small. Exterior dorsal row of scales largest, delicately carinated, 
remainder of equal size. Above deep blackish brown. An ochraceous 
or dark gamboge-yellow dorsal stripe begins at the occiput, and sud- 
denly widening to the width of three or four scales, contracts gradually 
to one and two half-rows, at which it continues to the tail. On each 
side is a well-defined stripe of greenish yellow along the second and 
part of the third outer row, and contrasting decidedly in color with the 
vertebral line. The blackish brown color is strongly defined between 
the stripes, below them the greenish white sides and abdomen are 
tinged with brown (on the exterior dorsal and ends of abdominal

which sometimes shows wheu the scales are separated, though usually 
covered by the incumbent edges. Superior labials with only traces of 
black borders at the upper ])Osterior angles of the middle three or five. 

This subspecies is readily distinguished from its nearest analogue, 
E. e. lineolata, by the darker 
color of the sides, the better 
defined dorsal and lateral 
stripes, smaller head, smaller 
number of temporal scales, etc. 
It has a strong resemblance to 
l^J. proxima in distribution of 
color, but is stouter and shorter, 
and has the lateral strij^e on the 
second and third rows, not on 
the third and fourth. 

But two specimens of this 
form have come under my obser- 
vation. In the type (Cat. No. 

882) the end of the tail is not certainly complete, but it is so in the 
second (Cat. No. 878). In the latter the tail enters the total length 
three and three-quarters times. In both the temi)orals are 1-2-3; the 
lowest of the third row, at the distal end of the last superior labial.

quently wanting on the anterior part of the length. Lips with or with-

of every other row of scales along the median and lateral stripes. On 
stretching the skin, these marks are seen to be parts of narrow brown 
crossbars, a superior row alternating with an inferior row, each occu- 
pying about a scale in width. The number of these bars is generally 
greater than in any other subspecies or species, ranging up to 103, but 
sometimes they arc as few as 84, thus equaling some of the specimens 
of ly\ couchii. The ground color is alike between all of them. There 
is in adults a blackish cordiform mark on the nape, which represents 
the nuchal spot in the E. e. couchii, etc., and the top of the head is like 
the back, brownish clay color. 

In the specimen which has served as my type (Cat. No. 8731) the tail 
enters the total length four and one third times. Gastrosteges, one 
hundred and fifty-eight; urosteges, seventy-four; anal, one. 

In young specimens the dorsal spots are more distinct, but never so 
large and distinct as in the J5J. e. lineolata. The top of the head is 

darker, and there are distinct 
nuchal sj^ots, thus approach- 
ing the E. e. couchii. There is 
considerable difference in the 
distinctness of the spots in 
adults. Til us. Cat. No. 8727 
(Taos, New Mexico), and Cat. 
No. 5497 (Fort Bridger, Wyo- 
ming) the spots are well marked 
as in E. e. marciana, but those 
below the lateral stripe are not 
so distinct, being represented by 
traces only. In Cat. No. Ol'O the 
top of the head and nape are black, and the labials are bordered with 
the same. The si)ecimen is small. On the other hand, in Cat. No. -"MI'S, 
no sijots appear on the scales, and their existence is only discoverable 
by stretching the skin. 

Measurements of sixteen specimens show the proportions of tlie tail 
to the total length. Cat. No. 000, three and four-tifths times; Cat. No. 
8730, four and one-third; Cat. No. 8735 ('J), four and one fifth and three 
and four-fifths; Cat. No. 11725, three and four-fifths; Cat. No. 0514 (3), 
four and four and two fifths; Cat. No. 5351 (2), four and four and one- 
fourth; Cat. No. 926, four and one-tenth; Cat. No. 8720, four and two- 
fifths; Cat. No. 8723, four and one fifth; Cat. No. 5226, four; Cat. No. 
7237, three and two-thirds; Cat. No. 8728, three and two-thirds, 

This form inhabits the central regions of North America, including 
the three topographical divisions — the Great Plains, the Colorado Basin, 
and the Nevada Basin. It is not known from the Sonoran region, and

C.it. No. 6496. (• S.N.M. 

Twenty-one rows of scales. Form rather slender; headlong, snout 
elongate and narrow, but rather obtuse. Postorbitals three, the upper 
much the largest. Eight upi)er labials, sixth largest; its postero- 
iuferior angle much elongated. No dorsal stripe; lateral stripe olive 
yellow on the second and third rows. Back uniform dark olive brown 
or blackish, without distinct spots. Abdomen whitish olive, lighter 
anteriorly, and a dark line along the middle posteriorly. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 1043 

Form rather sleuder, the tail about one-fourth the total length. Head 
very narrow and much elongated; the snout very narrow, but rather 
obtuse. The back above the third row of scales is dark uniform brown- 
ish lead-color without band, except a light olivaceous yellow; first 
row of scales a little darker, and similar to the abdomen, being of a 
very dull whitish olive. Bases of the scales of the first row black, form- 
ing a row of from 74 to SO small spots; bases of abdominal scutes the 
same, the color broader toward their extremities, and generally con- 
cealed by the incumbent scute. A narrow slate-colored line along the 
middle of the abdomen jwsteriorly. Head above, dark olive; superior 
labials very light olive yellow, margined with black posteriorly, except- 
ing the eighth. This is black anteriorly, its x)OSterior end being occu- 
pied by a yellowish patch which is confluent with the yellow of the 
neck. Lower postorbitals yellow. Two small yellow occipital dots and 
a small yellow dot on each side of the posterior part of the vertical 
plate; these sometimes absent. 

Toung specimens, and older ones, after the removal of the epidermis, 
exhibit faint indications of a very narrow dorsal stripe upon a single 
row of scales, but in one there is no trace of this, even upon the neck, 
where it is usually visible. These specimens also exhibit traces of two 
series of large alternating spots, which present somewhat the appear- 
ance of a zigzag line. In a young specimen there is a distinct series of 
spots on the first dorsal row, each spot covering one scale, and sepa- 
rated from those adjacent by two scales. Only one sjjecimen is without 
the dark line upon the abdomen posteriorly. There are no irregular 
black blotches upon the abdomen as in U. angustirostris. In Cat. No. 
11775 the small lateral spots are ninety-one in number, thus equaling 
that seen in the U. e. vmjrans. 

The length of the tail varies within limits. Thus in Cat. No. 5219G it 
enters the length four and one tenth times; in Cat. No. 8384, four and 
three-fifth times, and in Cat. No. 8745, four and two-third times. 

Adults of this subspecies are generally easily recognized. Small 
specimens approach corresponding ones of the U. e. vagrmis, since they 
agree in the dark colored upper surface of the head, nuchal spots, and 
labial borders. An adult (Cat. No. 860) from the Pitt Kiver, California, 
resembles an adult J^. cvagrans more than usual, but has no dorsal 
stripe except on the anterior frontal of the length. The nuchal spots 
are distinct, and the labials are blackish bordered, but the gastrosteges 
have black blotches at their middles and bases, as is not the case in 
the other specimens of U. e. couchii. In this individual the muzzle is 
elongate and more compressed than usual, resembling that of the 
E. muWmacHlata. There are also four rows of temporals. This indi- 
vidual represents a local race, and its habitat is out of the usual range 
of the species. It is the one from which the description of the 
E. couchii was drawn by Kennicott. 

The range of this subspecies is Southern California and Arizona.

This form is generally easily recognizable in adults by the absence of 
the vertebral stripe. But Van Denburgh describes a specimen from 
Lower California, in which the dorsal stripe is present.

The markings about the head are generally very constant and dis- 
tin('t. Viewed laterally, we see first the largo dark-brown patch at the 
back i)art of the head, extending as far back as the posterior extremity 
of the jawbones. In the anterior part of this patch is seen the cres- 
centic patch (coucave before) of yellowish white, with a more or less 
narrow dark-brown margin anteriorly. The next black band starts 
iVom the posterior edge of the superciliaries. and passes obli(inely down- 
ward and backward along the posterior edge of the sixth upper labial. 
Siniihir black margins are seen on the posterior edges of the fifth and 
fourth labials, tlie intervening spaces being yellowish white, particu- 
larly on the fifth upper labial. Occasionally the posterior margins of 
the seventh and third labials have the black line as well as those men- 
tioned, which freijuently 
extend across to the poste- 
rior margins of the cor- 
responding lower labials. 
The white spot on the ante- 
rior portion of the occipital 
suture is always margined 
with black. 

Tlie six series of black 
spots are arranged so as to 
alternate with each other. 
The lower or third series 
on each side is below the 
indistinct lateral stripe. 

The posterior edges of each abdominal scutella shows a black margined 
spot on each side. The dorsal line is generally a single scale in width, 
occasionally including portions of the lateral, and itself sometimes 
encroached upon by the black spots. Each spot is about a scale or 
a scale and a half long and about three scales broad. The number 
in the dorsal series from the head to the anus varies from fifty-six 
to sixty, but in Cat. 'No. 8(»0 they number seventy-three. Posterior 
edges of scales very slightly emarginate, if at all. All are decidedly 
keeled.

scuta and scutellte and the dimensions in inches:

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



The tail measures into the total length as follows : Cat. ISTo. 844 (type), 
four and one-tenth times; Cat. No. 7235, four and tliree-iifths; Cat. ^o. 
404, four; Cat. No. 5351, four; Cat. No. 841G, four and two-fifths; Cat. 
No. 1418, four and one-fourth. 

As in IJ. e. ra(jrans, the top of the head is black in young specimens. 
In very large specimens an approximation to the E. e. vagrans is seen 
the paling of the dorsal spots by the restriction of the black color to 
the skin and its disappearance from tlie scales. The spots below the 
lateral lines become especially indistinct, and this is important, since 
these are one of the distinguishing features of the species (Cat. Nos. 
841G, 8117). The head markings retain their bright contrast of colors, 
so that the subspecies is always easily distinguished. 

The range of this species is rather restricted, being c(m fined to the 
Rio (Irande Valley and a limited region on each side of it to its mouth. 
In Texas it extends as far east as San Antonio.

This form is quite different from anj^ of those enumerated as sub- 
species of E. elegans, but it resembles considerably the E. sirtalis 
jHirietalis. The distribution of colors is quite the same as in that form, 
but the red between the lateral spots is of a chestnut color, and not

crimson, as in E. s. parietal is. The agreement of the scale and labial 
formula' with those of the E. elrqanfi induces me to refer it to that species 
rather tiian to the JE. sirtali.s, although the latter cxliibits occasionally 
in California eiglit upper labials. 

r>esides the characters mentioned, this form has a. yellow dorsal stri])e 
which is well defined, covering one and two half rows of scales. The 
lateral stri[)e is defined below by a browu shade, which fades into the 
brownish olive of the belly below. The spots of the inferior lateral

aiul abdomen are asliy olive, with irregular heavy black blotches upon 
the latter, more numerous along the middle third, but off'eriug no indi- 
cation of a narrow black line as in J^. elegans couchii. On the first three 
rows some scattered scales have black spots on their bases and edges. 
Head above dark olive; upper labials light olive with vertical edgings. 

A young specimen is entirely black ; the dorsal stripe obsolete, being 
indicated only by a faint line on a single row of scales; the lateial 
stripes very indistinct; the first and part of the second row of scales 
entirely black. A whitish line along each side of the abdomen formed 
by a white spot at the end of each scute. These are also margined 
posteriorly with the same color. Throat whitish. 

The remarkable elongation of the snout will distinguish this species 
from any others at jjresent known, excepting U. multlmaculatd, from 
which it differs in other respects. The snout is more elongated, and 
decidedly more pointed than in U. e. coucJiii or U. leptoeephalii ; the 
head is not at all depressed anteriorly as in E. leptocephala, and the 
eye is strikingly larger. The colors of the back and abdomen are 
darker, and the rows of scales are twenty-one, not nineteen. As com- 
pared with Ij. e. couchii, which it most nearly resembles, beside the 
difference in the form of the snout, the head is depressed posteriorly 
(not anteriorly); hence the crown is quite plane throughout, while in 
U. e. couchii the crown is somewhat arched, this form being more 
observable upon the occipital and frontal region. In E. angusfiro.stiis 
^the general form is stouter, while the head is longer, and hence a greater 
elongation of the frontal and parietal plates. The scales of the upi)er 
rows are also larger and more elongated, and more strongly carinate. 
The tail is stouter, being considerably less than one-fourth the total 
length, while in E. e. couchii it is fully or more than one-fourth. This 
member is also very slender, the body tapering abruptly near the anus 
in the former species. The dorsal stripe, though narrow, is not want- 
ing, and the abdomen is much darker, being ashy olive, with heavy 
black blotches throughout, instead of light yellow or grayish olive, and 
there is no indication of the central line. The young specimen is strik- 
ingly different from the young of E. e. couchii. 

Temporals 1-2-3 on one side and 1-3-4 on the other. The tail is 
longer than in E. eleyans, entering the total length three and one-fourth 
times. 

But one specimen has been thus far obtained. The elongate muzzle, 
narrow labial plates, and longer tail distinguish it from the allied spe- 
cies. The coloration is also quite i)eculiar, and may be characteristic, 
as the specimen is small.

Head wide, very distinct; body slender. Scales in nineteen rows, 
rather narrow; the lirst as deep as long, wealily keeled; the second 
intermediate in form between the first and third; remainder rather 
narrow, not emarginate. Superior labials eight. Loreal as high as 
long; oculars 1—3. Temporals in type 1-3-3; in a second specimen 
from the same region 1-2-3 on one side, and 1-2-1 on the other. Tail 
varyin,g in length according to the subspecies. Frontal plate not wider 
than the superciliaries. P^yes large, muzzle short. 

Ground color above, light reddish brown; below, pale green. Three 
longitudinal stripes above, the median narrow more or less of its length 
on one row of scales, the lateral on the second and third row of scales. 
Two rows of black spots occupy the space between the stripes. These 
spots generally combine into a single row of large spots on the anterior 
parr of the body, but do not in one specimen (Cat. No. 80G7, the type). 
They also frequently join at their angles, forming a zigzag black band. 
A row of large Jet-black spots below the lateral stripe alternates with 
the spots of the inferior row. Belly immaculate. 

This well marled species has the slenderness of body, and in one 
form the length of tail, of the Euiwnia ])rox'nn(t, but it has a head and 
scales of the K. eleg<(ns tyi)e. It is characterized by the narrowness of 
the dorsal stripe, together with the huge black nuchal spots. 

It is represented by four subspecies, which differ as follows: 

I. Dorsal strij)e on three rows of scales on anterior half of body. 

Stripes yellow, not black borden'd. No conspicuous sjjots below lateral stripe. 

E. e. a II rata. 

II. Dorsal stripes on one row of scales only.

Check-list N. Amer. P.ati-. Kept., 1875, p. 41. 

Form very slender, but little stouter than that of E. saurita, but 
with shorter tail, one-fourth the total length. Head large. Eye very 
large. Superior labials eight, sixth and seventh largest. Three post 
orbitals, upper much the largest. Scales in nineteen rows. Color 
above olive brown, appearance of a zigzag line. Dorsal stripe whitish, 
narrow, distinct to the tip of the tail. Lateral stripe on the second 
and third rows of the same color, broad, distinct from head to anus. 
A series of black spots on the tirst dorsal row; abdomen uniform green- 
ish white. Orbitals whitish ; occipital spots obsolete. 

This si^pcios somewhat resembles TJ. marciana in the pattern of col- 
oration, which, however, has the lateral stripe upon the third row only, 

instead of the third and sec- 
ond. The difference in form 
is most striking, the body 
being almost as slender as in 
E. saurita. The scales are 
rather larger than in E. mar- 
(ianaj and those of the first 
row more elongated. The 
ground color above the 
lateral stripe is olive brown. 
The first dorsal row is whitish 
olive or greenish white. The 
abdomen is uniform greenish 
white, exce^it a small black 
marginal spot near the ex 
tremity of each abdominal 
scute. The whitish dorsal 
row occupies one, and less 
tliau two half rows of scales, and is encroached upon by the black 
dorsal blotches, which sometimes reach the central row. The lateral 
stripe is also encroached upon by the spots above and below it, 
thongh never entirely interrupted by them near the head, as in E. mar- 
ciana. The head is dark olive above; labials margined vertically with 
black, somewhat as in E. marciana^ except the seventh plate, which 
in the former is heavily bordered with black on both edges; in the 
latter slightly upon the anterior edge alone. There is a vertical light 
patch at the angle of the mouth crossing the posterior upper labial, 
and confluent with the white of the neck and not<listinct and crescent- 
shaped, as in E. marciana. Behind the occipital plates is a very large 
double black blotch. Behind this there are three or four perfect square 
blotches extending quite from the dorsal to the lateral stripe, each three 
scales in length, and separated by intervals of about two scales wide. 
Behind these the general pattern of spots is seen. It consists of two

series of large, oblong', rlioinboidal, alternating spots, each about four 
scales long, and somewhat continent with each other at the adjacent 
corners, giving the api)earance of a zigzag line upon each side. On 
the first and second dorsal rows is a third series of veiy distinct black 
s])ots, each on parts of tliree scales, and the extremities of two abdomi- 
nal scutes. The intervening spaces of greenish white ground color are 
eijual in width to the spots.

Other specimens have the dorsal stri{)e on a single row of si^ales ;iud 
the lateral stri])e has its ui)per border regular and distinct, without 
interruption from tiie middle series of spots, the lower edge as in the 
speciuien above described. Instead of the distinct spots upon the first 
and second rows in that specimen, they are here broken up into black 
borders of three approximated scales. In the only large specimen of 
this variety the keels of the first dorsal row are not parallel to those 
of the rows above, being directed obliquely downward and backward, 
so that the posterior end of one keel falls below the anterior end of the 
next succeeding, instead of forming a continuous line. The nose of 
this specimen is also more pointed than in the typical one. 

The lengths of the tails in this subspecies are as follows : Cat. Xo. 81)07

Form (»f medium robustness; head well distinguished; tail four and 
two-tifths times in total length. Scales in nineteen series, those of the 
inferior row as deep as long, smooth, or feebly keeled; the transverse 
diameter of the scales diminishing gradually and nowhere so small as 
in E. e. eqiies and species of the U. saurita series. Superior labials 
eight, all dee[)er than long. Loreal deeper than long; oculars, 1-3. 
Temporals, 1-2-3. Frontal wider than superciliaries, not reaching pre- 
ocular; parietals rather short and wide. Scuta, 108-1-74.

border except tlie last; the penultimate with the yellow reduced to an 
oval spot on the anterior inferior portion. A large black nuchal spot 
on eacli side of the narrow median yellow stripe. 

The brown of the body is uniform, and the three longitudinal stripes

are without black borders. The dorsal stripe occupies the middle and 
parts of two adjacent rows of scales on the anterior half of the length, 
and one row on the posterior half, and is continued to the end of the 
tail. The lateral stripe covers two entire rows of scales except on the 
posterior half, where it occupies the second row only. It is bordered 
belowby a baud of a rather lighter brown than that of the space above it, 
on the first row of scales, and on the angles of the gastrosteges which 
enter between the separate scales of the latter. Every other scale of the 
first row has a black speck at its upper and lower base. Belly immacu- 
late yellow, except a l)lack shade at the base of the extremity of a few 
of the scuta, which is only visible on stretching the latter apart. 

This handsome form resembles the Eutcenia clegans brunnea in gen- 
eral form and appearance, but the latter has no nuchal spots nor black 
labial borders nor band beneath the lateral stri[)e. It belongs to a

different section of the genus. Its nuchal spots and labial borders are 
like those of the EaUvnla e. equeti, but it is not a slender-bodied 
species, and the scales are wider than in that form, representing a dif- 
ferent type in the genus. 

I have seen but one specimen of this species, which 1 obtained near

loriiiula of the latter. In color pattern it differs from all the subspe- 
cies of either, and, as its tail is generally longer than either, it is nec- 
essfiry to admit it as a sei)arate species. It is more than usually 
compressed at the anal region, where the scales are wide and more 
irregular than is observed in other species. In the form vidua this 
compression extends to the entire body. There are two well-marked 
subspecies, as follows: 

Color blackish, with traces of an inferior row of spots and a distinct lateral stripe; 

belly yellowish olive, with black ceatt-r; throat and lips yellow K. i. Infernalis. 

Uniform l)lack, with yellow dorsal stripe only E. i. vidua.

contracts to one row and 
continues to the end. 
Belly from yellow to 
olivaceous, extending to the third'row of scales inclusive, with or with- 
out a shade on the first row distinguishing a lateral stripe, immaculate. 
Scales from fourth to eighth rows, inclusive, with the keels olivaceous 
or yellowish, forming delicate longitudinal lines. Shades of the same 
color are so distributed on the scales as to give the appearance of indis- 
tinct spots in two rows, an appearance which is increased by a few 
scattered yellowish dots on the margins of some of the scales. This 
appearance represents actual spots in young si)ecinH'ns. In some ot 
the large specimens this appearance is lost, nothing but the few yellpw 
specks remaining. Labial plates yellow or olive, with or without very 
narrow posterior black borders. Throat and chin always yellow. 

This subspecies resembles the Eutccnia elcgans llneolata, but it has 
always (sixteen specimens) one row of scales less on each side. The

tlie species of the HJ. sirtnlis group, but is quite different from any 
of the forms which I have included in that protean species. The 
tail is longer, as I find out of ninety-seven specimens of the latter 
which I have measured but five have the tail as long as in the speci- 
men of E. vidua with the shortest tail and none with so long a tail as 
the other. The eight superior labials distinguishes it from all but 
four specimens of the ninety-seven, and in some of these the additional 
labial is an intercalation. Two of the four specimens come from the 
same locality, namely, San Francisco. The compressed body is seen 
in a few specimens of the E. NirtaU.s pickeringii, also from the Pacific 
region, but not in any other forms. In some of these the stripes dis- 
api)ear, but all together, and not the lateral only, leaving a well- 
deve]oi)ed dorsal. The coloration is a curious parallel of the " y/</«a" 
form of the E. leptocephala^ which it closely resembles. The superior 
labials of the latter are different in being lighter and with black borders, 
and the throat is whitish and the muzzle brown. 

While this form has these points of connection with certain extremes 
of variation of the E. sirtalis, it agrees with none of them, and may be 
regarded as a species until more definite points of connection are found.

But one specimen of this species has yet been obtained. It is small, 
but not young, and it belongs to the group of which E. sirtaJis and E. 
leptocephdla are members. It resembles both these species, but differs 
in important particulars. The labial plates are six above and eight 
below, instead of seven above and ten below. The head is not distinct 
from the neck, resembling in this respect the Tropidodonium lineatuin. 
The parietal scuta are convex in outline and not contracted posteriorly. 
The head plates are otherwise as in those species, including oculars 1-3, 
temporals 1-U; and postgeneials longer than ])regeneials. Scalesin nine 
teen series, all keeled except the inferior row, which has a trace of a 
keel. Gastrosteges, one hundred and thirty-two; anal, one; urosteges, 
seventy-i,W(). 

Color below and upper lii) light olive, unspotted; above darker olive, 
with a broad, brown band on each side, which extends from the fourth

to the middle of the iiiiitli row, inchisive, le;iviiif^ a pale dorsal stripe of 
groimd color one and two half scales wide. Chin and anal plate yel- 
lowish. Xo parietal pair of spots visible to the eye, but traces appear 
under a nuignitier. 

Measuremoits. — Total length, liSO mm.; tail, 7L mm. 

The reduction of the number of labial plates is not etfected by the 
fusion of the fifth and sixth of the E. sirfalLs, as 1 at first suggested, 
since the abbreviation of the i)late, which, though longer than those 
adjacent to it, does not equal the two plates in the ?J. sirtaHs, and the 
sutures of the last two labials in no wise correspond with those of 
the other species. The normality of the structure is confirmed by the 
reduction of the inferior labial series by two scales, all of which are of 
perfectly normal form. The gastrosteges are fewer in number than in 
any E. sirtalis or U. leptocephala 
known to me, while the number of 
urosteges remains as in those species. 
The inferior scale of the second row 
of temporals is almost obliterated on 
one side. The absence of spots on 
the gastrosteges distinguishes it from 
most of the subspecies of E. sirtalis. 
The general form is that of Tropi- 
docioninm, and the distinctness of the 
two nasal plates is the only external 
feature which separates it from that 
genus. It is one of the forms — of which several are now known — 
which, while retaining the general features of the water snakes, have 
adopted a terrestrial life and more or less burrowing habits. 

Dr. Boulenger, in commenting on this species, supposes it to be a 
E. leptocephala., questioning the correctness of the locality. There is, 
however, no mistake as to this latter point. It has a superior labial 
less and twelve gastrosteges less than the smallest number I have met 
with in that species.

Color varying from light reddish brown to black, with dorsal and 
lateral stripes present or absent. When the lateral spots are present 
they are small, are ranged along the borders of the stripes, or their 
positions, and are not in contact with each other. Belly varying from 
black to olive with blackish shades on the bases or more of the gastro- 
steges, and without definite spots on the extremities of the latter. 

This variable species may be distinguished from E. sirtalis, its near- 
est ally, by the narrow, scarcely distinct head, more strongly grooved 
preocular region ; the small size of the dorsal spots when present, and 
the absence of spots on the ends of the gastrosteges. There are, how- 
ever, some specimens in which the head is of much the shape of that of 
the E. sirtalis, and some of the latter {E. s. (jraminea) have no spots 
on the ends of the gastrosteges. The majority of the specimens of the 
E. leptoceplmla differ further in the presence of two preocular scales, 
and about half of the specimens have but seventeen rows of scales. 
On specimens of the latter kind the E. cooperii and E. atrata were 
established. Of twenty-six specimens examined, twelve have the scales

in .seventeen rows, and fouiteeii in nineteen rows, in some of those 
with nineteen rows the additional row extends but a short distance on 
each side, so that for all but a small part of the length there are seven- 
teen rows. In thirteen individuals there is but one preocular on each 
side; in two there are one on one side and two on tlie other, and in 
eleven individuals there are two on each side. Two i)reoculars prevail 
in the spotted ty])es, for of eight of these but three have a single pre- 
ocular. Five of the bhudc and well-strii)ed specimens liave two preocu- 
lars on both sides, and two have two on one side and one on the other, 
while all of the uniform colored specimens, whether light or dark, have 
but one preocular on both sides. The grooving of the preocular region 
is generally, but not invariably, present. In several specimens the sec- 
ond or third rows of temporals are represented by a single plate, 
appropriately to the small size of the head. 

The color varieties are as follows : Brown, with blackish spots, moder- 
ately distinct stri])es (eleven specimens); black, with the dorsal and 
generally the lateral stripe well defined (eight specimens); black, with 
stripes and spots very indistinct (five specimens); black with dorsal 
stripe only {JE. atrata) (one specimen); uniform brownish or olive (three 
specimens). 

These forms have no distinct geographical range, examples of all of 
them coming from Tuget Sound. As a whole, the species belongs to the 
Pacific coast, not south of San Francisco. How far east it ranges is not 
known, but I have never seen it from central Oregon or Washington. 
One specimen (Cat. ^STo. 5208) in the U. S. National Museum collection 
is marked as coming from the " Eocky Mountains." 

An interesting series of eight specimens was obtained by Mr, S. N. 
Ehoads — five from Tacoma and three from Victoria, British Columbia. 
He did not obtain it from any locality east of the latter point. In my 
paper on the " Characters and variations of the snakes of IS^orth Amer- 
ica,"^ I state that of the specimens in the U. S. IS^ational Museum 
rather less than half have two preocular plates, and one-half have seven- 
teen and the other half nineteen rows of scales. Of the eight specimens 
brought by Mr. Ehoads, six have two and two have three preoculars, 
one of the latter coming from Tacoma and one from Victoria; six have 
seventeen rows of scales and two have nineteen, both the latter from 
Tacoma. The distinctive characters of the species are thus confirmed. 
The ground color in two of the Tacoma specimens is black and the 
others brown. All of the Victoria specimens are brown, and two of 
them have a red dorsal stripe.

Form moderately slender, the tail a little less than one-fourth the 
total length. Head narrow, elevated, the profile sloping in front; muz- 
zle obtuse. Temi^oral small, not attaining the reduced last upper 
labial. Front of plate narrow, half as wide as long, with concave or 
parallel lateral borders. Occipitals elongate. Loreal plate higher than 
long; one preocular, three postoculars. Superior labials, seven ; fourth 
and fifth entering the orbit. Inferior labials, ten. Anterior geneials 
longer than posterior. Scales in nineteen rows, not emarginate ; lateral 
stripe on the second and third rows. Gastrosteges, one hundred and 
forty- three; an entire anal; urosteges, fifty-nine pair. 

Beneath and upon the first row of scales, dark, ashy olivaceous, the 
latter freipiently black at their bases. Second and one-half the third 
row of scales a little paler. The vertebral and the borders of one row 
on each side of it yellowish. The color of the remainder of the upper 
surface is brown, anteriorly shaded with olivaceous. This is crossed 
from the lateral to the dorsal stripe on each side by black or deep- 
brown transverse bars, numbering, from the head to the origin of the tail, 
about sixty. There is a pair of large spots just behind the occipital 
plates, and one involving the temporals and the whole of the occip- 
itals, its anterior border trilobate and produced upon the vertical and 
superciliaries. A short yellowish vitta, extending from the posterior

p. 210. 
Euionia c\irtops\s var. phenax Bocoukt, Miss. Soi. Mex., 1S93, p. 778. 

This is a handsome and peculiar species, being- the only one of the 
genus which is cross-banded. 

Scales in nineteen rows; all keeled excei)t the first. General form 
much as in E. sirtaUs. Head rather short, muzzle obtuse, eye large, 
superciliary plates arched. Diameter of eye equal from same to rostral 
plate along the labials. Frontal shortened behind, with straight sides, 
equal to .75 of parietal common suture. Parietals truncate behind. 
Upper labials, eight ; fourth and fifth in orbit. Loreal longer than high, 
one preocular, temporals 1-2. Inferior labials nine, sixth largest; 
geneials equal. Gastrosteges, one hundred and sixty-one; anal, one; 
urosteges, sixty-three. 

Measurements. — Total length, 23 inches 5 lines; tail, 5 inches; to 
rictus oris, 6 lines. 

Above, reddish olive, crossed by thirty-six transverse spots, which are 
of a bright brownish-red with a narrow black margin. They are sepa- 
rated by transverse intervals of only a scale in width, lience the black 
margins appear as i^aired crossbars. These crossbars extend to the 
first row of scales and are as often continuous on the side as not. There 
is no lateral stripe, but there are black spots on the corners of the ends 
of the gastrosteges. The margin of the first brown spot is in form of 
two black lines diverging from the parietal plates backward. There is 
a brown bar in front of the frontal, one on the frontal, and sni)erciliaries 
behind (imperfect), and a longitudinal on each parietal. Xo pair of 
light parietal s]»ots. Labials below eye with the last black margined, 
otherwise light olive. Below, a strong green, unspotted. Sometimes 
the brown spots are interrupted on the middle line, in the position of 
the dorsal stripe seen in so many species of EuffViiia, but this is very 
exceptional, and the ground color shows no trace of stripes. 

The E. phenax is one of the smaller species and is, so far as now known, 
confined to eastern Mexico.

Scales in nineteen rows. Lower row of scales smooth; urosteges, 
sixty-seven; a dorsal stripe; lateral stripe bordered below by a brown 
or black stripe; a black nnclial spot; head brown. 

At first sight this species looks like the U.favilahris Cope, but it 
has characters of the E. eqiies and adds some of its own. 

The dorsal stripe, as in E. eqnes, occupies but a single row of scales. 
The lateral stripe occupies the adjacent edges of the second and third 
rows. The entire first row is covered by a broad brown band, which 
defines the lateral light band very distinctly below. This is not seen 
in either of the species above named. There are two rows of black 
spots between the dorsal and lateral bands, but the keels of all the 
scales involved in them are brown. There are sometimes spots below 
the lateral light line on the neck, due to interruptions in the lateral 
dark stripe. A large nuchal black spot, which is notched behind by the 
median band and sometimes divided. Superior labials black-bordered 
posteriorly, es])ecially the sixth, where the border is sometimes very 
wide. Head above brown; lower surfaces uniform greenish, except 
tail, which is yellowish below. Occipital spots very indistinct. 

The head is not very distinct from the neck. The frontal plate is 
wider than the supraorbitals. Gastrosteges, one hundred and fifty- 
eight; urosteges, sixty-seven. 

Measurements. — Total length, 465 mm.; length of tail, 105 mm. 

This handsome species varies in the intensity of its dark colors, the 
ground between the dorsal spots being sometimes so dark as to give 
the spaces between the yellow stripes the appearance of uniform bands. 
In such specimens the lateral dark stripe is least interrupted. 

Boulenger unites this species with the E. eques. It, however, belongs 
to a different section of the genus. 

According to Duges, this species is fotind in the States of Guana- 
juato and Mexico. I have three specimens from the State of Mexico, 
from Mr. Hoeje; four from the State of Puebla, from the Exploring 
Commission, and one from Zacualtipan (Hidalgo), from Dr. S. Bernad.

Scales in iiiiieteeu rows ; no longitudinal bands. Olive brown, with 
four series of small black s})ots, and a trace of two exterior anteriorly; 
eight superioi- labials, all liigher than long except the seventh, no black 
margin on the sixth or posterior margin of eighth, but a strong black 
baud from eye across jjosterior margin of seventh to mouth. Sides of 
head white, extending upward as two areas, margining each occipital; 
behind each a black nuchal spot separated by a narrow white line from 
its fellow and extending over occipital plates and half of frontal; pre- 
frontals transverse. 

The markings of this species are entirely peculiar; it is also dis- 
tinguished by the transverse or narrow prefrontals and internasals. 

To this description I add some notes taken from a third specimen. 
The frontal plate is wider than the supraorbitals. There are eight 
superior labials, and the orbit is bounded by the fourth and fifth. 
Temporals, 1-2 ; orl)itals, 1-3. There is a trace of a dorsal stripe on the 
nape, which divides the nuchal spot into two. iS"o postoral crescent. 
Below the square lateral spots on the sides of the neck is a row of 
smaller, alternating scpiare spots, which serve to define a lateral stripe 
for a short distance. Su|)erior labials brownish yellow, brown edged. 
Inferior surfaces uniform dirty yellow. 

The keels of the scales are very strong, except those of the first row, 
which are obsolete. Gastrosteges, one hundred and forty-eight; uro- 
steges, sixty-five.

Scales in sevejiteen rows, inferior row heeled; nrosteges, eiglityone; 
no dorsal stripe ; a large black nuchal spot; head yellow; body slendrr, 
with a wide flat head, with a large eye. The size of the latter con-

posteriorly. The scuta are otherwise as usual. Superior labials, eight, 
none higher than long, fourth and fifth below the orbit. The inferior sur- 
faces are darker than in E. eques collaris, which causes a better definition 
of the lateral line than in that species. There are rei)resentations of 
two rows of lateral black spots, but they are merely black scale borders, 
those of the inferior row the more distinct. A similar row of black 
edges on the first row of scales. All of these spots become distinct on 
the sides of the neck. IsTuchal spot large, black, and with a shallow 
notch behind, no occii)ital or other spots on the head. The gastrosteges 
have black bases, a character not seen in any of the other species 
referred to.

robust; tail between one-fourth and one-fifth the total lenijth, very 
rarely shorter than one-fifth or larger than one-fourth. Superior labial 
plates eight, all higher than loug, except the first and second. Loreal 
not longer than Iiigh; oculars 1-3; temporals 1-2-3. Frontal much 
wider than superciliaries; parietals rather short. Scales in nine- 
teen rows, not very narrow, not emarginate except the inferior three 
rows; the first as deep as long and feebly k-eeled. Postgeneials longer 
than pregeneials, generally separated to the base by small scales. 

Color varying from light green through olivaceous to black, traversed 
by three longitudinal stripes, of which the laterals are not well defined 
below, and all three may be wanting. Spaces between them uniform, 
or marked by two rows of alternating black or brown spots, of which 
those of the superior row may or may not be confiuent with each other. 
In most of the forms there is a round black spot on the anterior jjart of 
each gastrostege about 5 mm. from the end. Belly generally light 
bluish green, but varying to darker and black. 

This species ranges over all North America, being limited to the 
north by its capacity for enduring cold and extending south to Guate- 
mala. In its essential characters it is quite constant, but it varies in 
color so as to include several races or subspecies. Of one hundred and 
two specimens examined but three have twenty-one rows of scales, the 
rest having nineteen. Of the same number examined but six have 
eight superior labials on both sides, and the additional labial is gener- 
ally smaller than the others so as to be an evident abnormality, though 
sometimes it is regular. In nine specimens the additional labial appears 
on one side only. These abnormalities are distributed as follows :

Transitions between these forms aie common. The disappearance of 
the spots and stripes of E. s. sirtalis, which culminates in the IJ. s. 
yraminea, does not occur abruptly, but transitional specimens are not dif- 
ficult to find. Transitions to the dark form, U. s. ohscura, are not rare, 
the spots becoming, as in the correspouding case in U. elegans, confused 
and blended on the posterior part of the body first. The transition to 
the absence of spots also appears first posteriorly, Cat. No. 7798 having 
anteriorly the color marking of E. e. parietalis, and j)osteriorly that of 
E. e. dorsalis. On the other hand, the E. e. parietalis shows every 
gradation to the form E. e. ohscura, by confiuence of the spots. The 
spots are largest and fewest in E. s. sirtalis, where they range from 
seventy-six to seventy-eight. In E. s. parietalis they are more numerous, 
ranging from eighty-three to eighty-eight. E. s. dorsalis covers botii 
series, ranging from seventy to eighty-one.

I describe a typical specimen from Indiana. This form is a uniform 
light green above, below yellow clouded with green. Lips, chin, and 
throat uniform yellow. JSTo stripes or spots on the body, nor markings 
of any kind on the head. Scales, nineteen rows; superior labials, 
seven; temporals, 1-3, first large; gastrosteges, one hundred and fifty; 
anal, one; urosteges, sixty-six pair, four of the latter undivided; lowest 
row of scales smooth.

This form is the extreme in the direction taken by the />'. -s. orditutfa, 
where the bands are entirely wanting, but the quadrate lateral spots 
remain. In the entire absence of bla('k marks on tlie labial and 
abdominal plates, this form dif- 
fers also from its immediate 
allies. The coloration is that of 
Cyclophis <('stiri(.s. 

In a second specimen (Cat. No. 
U642) from Tuckermnck, Massa- 
chusetts, a small spot is to be 
seen on a few of the gastrosteges, 
while on two from Columbus, 
Ohio, and one from Andros- 
coggin, Maine, the gastrostegal 
spots are distinct. On one of the 
former, skeletons of black spots 

are visible behind the head. In one of them the tail enters f(»ur and 
one-third times into the total length.

iug, but for a faint trace. Three series of small square dark blotches 
ou each side, about eighty-five in number from head to anus. The first 
is on the outer row of dorsal scales, involving the edges of the contig- 
uous scales. The second on the fourth row; the third on each side of 
the dorsal stripe, both like the first, involving the edges of and inter- 
vals between the contiguous scales; indeed, on stretching apart the 
skin, the black spots are seen to be converted into a network of black 

along the skin. Beneath

black near each end of the

however, be readily distin- 
guished bj^ the three regular 
series of tessellated black 
spots on each side, their promi 
nence, and their number, 
about eighty-five, not seventy. The lateral stripe is nearly absent, and 
the dorsal ( uite indistinct. The lower row of blotches is below and 
along the place of the lateral stripes. The occipital black patch is 
much larger than in U. sirtalis, and the labials more margined.

In the most typical specimen of this species (Oat. No. 5222; northern 
Alabama), the dorsal spots of the superior row connect across the 
middle line, and do not connect with the spots of the inferior row. 
The form which is common about the eastern shore of Buzzards Bay 
and other parts of Massachusetts (Cat. No. 13330) has the same char- 
acter, l)ut the spots are larger and the gentral colors darker. 

This form or subspecies jjasses in one direction into the E. s. grami- 
nea., and in the otlier into the IJ. s. sirtali,s, as the spots and bands are 
more or less distinct. The spots are very indistinct in Cat. Nos, 1023, 
1047, 1040, 10r)0, 7808, 8901, and 14732, and traces of the stripes are 
visible in Cat. Nos. 990, 1023, 1049, and 14732. 

A specimen (Cat. No. 1033) from Blount County, Tennessee, is a mela- 
nistic form of this subspecies. The color is entirely black, except that the 
narrow interspaces between the large square alternate; lateral spots are 
a little paler; chin, throat, and superior labials below orbit, yellowish.

Color above the lateral stripes dark olive, in old specimens dark 
brown, beneath grecMush white. A narrow, rather indistinct vertebral 
greenish yellow line. Three series of small indistinct spots on each 
side, of about seventy from head to anus. The first series is along the 
exterior dorsal row, the spots about two scales apart. This is some- 
times entirely wanting. The second series is on the third, fourth, and

fifth rows IVoui the abdomen ; the third upou the eighth and uiiith. In 
many cases the last -mentioned rows have the spots on opposite sides 
more or less confluent, giving the ai)pe!>rance of a single median series. 
These rows of spots are sometimes of a dark chestnut brown, at others 
nearly black, and often so blended with the olivaceous of the back as 
to be scarcely discernible. Numerous short white lines visible on 
stretching the skin. 

Although the first, second, and third exterior dorsal rows of scales 
are colored like the abdomen, yet a lighter shade on the second and 
third gives indication of a lateral stripe. 

The bases of the abdominal scales on each side near the outer 
extremities have a black blotch. There is also the usual double spot 
on the occiput, not areolated. The dark spotting on the sides belongs 
more or less to the skin between the scales, in some cases merely ting- 
ing the edges of the latter. 

The relative leugtli of the tail to the total, as observed in 38 speci- 
mens, is as follows: Five and one-fifth times in total length, 1 specimen; 
five and one-fifteenth, 1 specimen; four and eleven -twelfths, 1; four 
and five-sixths, 2; four and four-fifths, 2: four and three- fourths, 5; 
four and three-fifths, 1; four and two-fifths 3; four and one- third, 1; 
four and one-fourth, 1 ; four and one-fifth, 1 ; four and one-eighth, 2; four 
and one-sixth, 3; four and one tenth, 1 ; four and one-twelfth, 2; four, 
2; three and nine-tenths, 1; three and three-fourths, 2. 

The definition of the spots in this subspecies varies, some having 
them of smaller and others of larger size, thus exposing more or less 
of the ground color. 

The E. s. sirtalis is the most abundant snake of the eastern region, 
and it is common in the Austroriparian, including the Floridan district. 
Its occurrence in the Texan district is uncertain, as I have not seen it 
from west of Dallas on the north and Galveston on the south. From 
the fact that it occurs in the wet portions of eastern Mexico and Guate- 
mala I suspect that it will be also found in southern Texas. 

Specimens derived from the Central, Pacific, and Sonoran regions, 
referred to this subspecies by various persons, I find on examination 
to be referable to other species or subspecies. No specimens of the 
E. sirtalis sirtalis have come under my observation from those regions. 
The most western locality from which the National Museum i)Ossesses a 
specimen is Fort Kearney (now Junction City), Kansas, Avhich is at the 
western limit of the eastern third of that State; Cat. No. C21. 

A color variation is exhibited bj^ Cat. No. 1008, from Bedford, Long- 
Island, New York, where the black spots of the superior rows con- 
nect with each other across the median dorsal stripe, cutting the lat- 
ter into sections. A corresponding peculiarity is seen in sojne speci- 
mens of U. s. ordinata. In Cat. No. 9992 the spots approach, but do 
not join.^

The dorsal stripe, as in E. eqiies, occupies but a single row of

black band, which defines the lateral light band very distinctly below. 
This is not seen in either of the species above named. There are two 
rows of black spots between the dorsal and lateral bands, but the keels 
of all the scales involved in them are brown or yellow. There are no 
sj)ots below the lateral light line, either on tlie neck or elsewhere. A 
large nuchal black spot, which is notched behind by the median l)and.

seventy-eight were taken from a female. He implies that he saw this done. C.

1072 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Few Seiss says ' that the aexes of this .species copulate in early spring and produce 
from thirteen to eighty young. That he has seen the latter from a single snake he 
does not say. Drs. Cones and Yarrow refer- to the habits of Eutwnia airtalis parie- 
talin as observed by them in Montana during the month of August. " At this 8ea.son 
ofthe year all the female individuals observed were gravid with nearly matured 
embryos. Like others ofthe genus, this species is ovoviviparous, the young being 
6 inches in length when born." In a specimen of E. s. sirtalis (No. 17960, U.S.N.M.), 
captured near the city of Indianapolis by Dr. Alex. .Jameson about August 1, I 
find thirty-nine partially developed young. Of these, twenty-five are in the right 
uterus. The young measures 6 inches in length. There is a considerable amount of 
yolk still remaining attached to these young, a fact which indicates that they will 
increase in size before birth. An examination of the mouth of some of these little 
snakes shows that the egg-tooth is present. The membrane which surrounds each 
egg is quite thin. The female bearing this lot of young is 33 inches in length. 
Another female (No. 17961, U.S.N.M.), from Paris, Illinois, of nearly the same 
size, contained about thirty-five young snakes, these being packed together so 
densely in the mother's body that it was difficult to determine the number accu- 
rately without removing them. They are each 7 incihes long, and are evidently just 
ready to be expelled. An examination of about half a dozen of them failed to ^eveal 
the presence of the egg-tooth, which has therefore been shed. Nor could I deter- 
mine with certainty that any egg-covering was present. The yolk of the egg, also, 
is wholly consumed. On opening these young snakes I find little or none of the 
yolk within the body. In this respect they contrast strongly with the young ofthe 
rattlesnakes. The young garter snakes must from the first depend on their own 
activities for support. This accords well with the report of Mr. C. Few Seiss, that 
the young of a female kept in confinement began to feed shortly after birth, strug- 
gling vigorously with one another for the earthworms thrown them. At what time 
during the summer the Paris, Illinois, specimen was captured I do not know. 
Seiss's statement that the sexes of E. s. sirtalis pair in the early spring has already 
been mentioned. 

Prof. F. W, Putnam'' informs us that on .July 1, in a female 35 inches long he 
found forty-two nearly developed young, each of which was 5. .5 inches long. Ijr. J. 
Schneck, of Mount Carmel, Illinois, says ■* that from a female 35 inches long he took 
seventy-eight young from 3 to 7 inches in length. They were pressed from the vent. 
The first twenty were free, the others confined within the egg coverings. A female 
from Paris, Illinois, contained thirty-five young, each 7 inches long. The food-yolk 
was all gone and the egg-tooth shed. It appears that the young are born late in the 
summer or early in the fall. The sexes are said to unite in September or in October, 
but it seems probable that this also occurs early in the spring. This is one of the 
snakes which has the reputation of swallowing its young when they are in peril. 
Col. N. Pike, who is an accurate observer, assured Dr. Goode"" that he had seen the 
garter snake afford its young family temporary protection in its throat, from which 
they were soon noticed to emerge. 

On the approach of cold weather these snakes seek some opening in the earth and 
then become dormant. In some instances thej^ appear to collect in considerable 
numbers where they pass their winter slumber. We thus occasionally hear of 
bundles of snakes being plowed up. E. L. Ellicott relates'" having seen very early 
in the spring, in Maryland, a bundle of garter snakes in which some hundreds of 
them could bo counted. It is altogether probable that such assemblages are deter- 
mined partly by the sexual impulses. The garter snake leaves its place of hiberna- 
tion apparently as soon as the first warm days come, although they may relapse 
again into the dormant condition. At Irvington I have taken them as early as the 
7th of March.

Dr. Bo'ijamaii Shiuj) ' observed the pioce-ss of exuviatiou in the garter snako. 
Two specimens were kept iu an aquaiinui. Wlieii observed one had Just crawled 
out of the water aud then shrugged and shook itself. Finding a narrow place, 
it pressed itself in so that the skin parted along the jaws. This was jjushed l>ack 
behind the head. Then the snake crawled throiigh the oi)euiug, escaping fiom 
tlie skin and leaving it tnrne<l inside out. The operation required less than a min- 
ute. One of the skins was without rent or loss of a scale. This occurred on April 
13. Some specimens that I kept for a while shed the skin about .June 1. In case the 
snake can not have access to water the shedding of the skin is a more prolonged 
operation.

EUTiENIA SIRTALIS OBSCURA Cope. 

Eutamia nirtalls ohscnra Coi'E, Check-list N. Auier. Batr. Rept., 1875, j). 41. — Yar- 
Kow, Reptiles U. S. CJeoj;-. Survey W. of 100th Mer., 1875, V, p. 546. 

A .specimen described by Baird and Girard nuder the bead of Unt(c- 
nia sirtalifi, from Westport, ]S^e^Y Yorlc, is iiuiformly blackish between 

the longitudinal stripes, when 
the epidermis is removed, and 
brown when it is present, the 
black spots being entirely 
fused. The keels of the scales 
are of a lighter brown. The 
belly is grayish green, with 
black spots near the ends of the 
gastrosteges, extending from 
the base, as in the typical i!/. s. 
sirtalis. In this respect it dif- 
fers from the E. s. trlvittata. 

In no other specimen have 
the spots disappeared by 
fusion, leaving the stripes intact, so perfectly as in this specimen. In 
those individuals (Cat. No. 1019) from the Lac qui Parle, Minnesota, the 
fusion is complete as to the superior row of spots, but the inferior may be 
seen faintly outlined on stretching the skin, as in some of the dark forms 
of E. s. jxirietalis. In a specimen in my private collection from Mitchells 
Bay, Ontario (Dr. J. H. Garnier), the spots are nearly obliterated and can 
not be defined anywhere, and the dorsal stripe is very obscure on the 
posterior half the length ; belly normal.

EUT.^NIA SIRTALIS SEMIFASCIATA Cope. 

Eniania sirtaUs semifascialus Ooi'E, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mas., XIV, 1892, p. 662. 

This subspecies or geographical race is represented by a number of 
.specimens in the national collection from northern Illinois and Wiscon- 
sin. It resembles in general the E. s. sirtalis in colors and proportions. 
The lower surfaces and the stripes are olivaceous, and the lateral and 
median stripes are sep- 
arated by two rows of 
spots, which occupy the 
entire width of the space 
on the sliin, but which 
do not touch each other 
as scale markings, the 
upper row being ranged 
along the median stripe 
and the lower along 
the lateral stripe. The 
jieculiarity of the form 
consists in the fact that 
on the anterior fifth or sixth of the length of the body the spots of the 
inferior row extend across the lateral stripe, breaking it up into sec- 
tions. In many of the si)ecimens the spots of the superior row become 
opposite to those of the inferior row and join them, and the latter again 
join a row which is below the lateral stripe. The three rows of spots 
thus become conHucnt fiom crossbars interrnjited only by the median 
dorsal stripe, as in the Extant ia sealaHs. The bars are much less regu- 
lar than in that species, the ])ait that crosses the lateral stripe being 
distinctly contracted and the superior part being mu(;h widened. 

Young specimens recently hatched (150 mm.) exhibit tlie same color 
character as the adults. 

In four specimens (Cat. No. 8070) of this form the tail measures, 
resi)ectively, four and eleven-twelfths, four and two fifths, four and 
three fifths, four and five sixths of the total length. Gastrosteges in 
one of the same, one hundred and fifty-three; anal, one; urosteges, 
sixty-one.

not of Baird and Girard. 
This subspecies is quite distinct in appearance from the U. s. sirtalis 
ill lite, and may be also readily distinguished in spirits after the disap- 
pearance of the bright red colors. 
It has also a definite geographical 
range. 

Form more slender than in the 
U. s. sirtalis; head quite distinct. 
Squamation identical with that of 
E. s. sirtalis. Gastrosteges (of 
Cat. No. 8738), one hundred and 
sixty-seven; anal, one; urosteges, 
eighty-eight. In Cat. No. 8737, 
gastrosteges, one hundred and 
sixty-two; anal, one; urosteges, 
eighty-live. Eelative length of 
tail in Cat. No. 8378 (2 specimens), 
three and seven-eighths times in total length; in Cat. No. 8737, four 
and one-eighth. 

Measurements. — Total length, 576 mm.; length of tail, 145 mm. 
Lower surfaces and lateral stripe olivaceous ; gastrosteges with a small 
black spot near each end. Dorsal stripe red, with a delicate black or deep 
brown border on each side. Space between dorsal and lateral stripes 
brown, marked with a single series of small black spots, which occupy 
parts of three rows of scales next to the lateral stripe, and do not, there- 
fore, reach the dorsal stripe. Spaces between the lateral spots red. 

The gastrostegal spots are smaller than in the E. s. sirtalis, and are 
more isolated and rounded; sometimes they aie not present on some of 
the gastrosteges. The labial plates are very little or not at all black- 
bordered. Parietal sjwts distinct.

Above dark olive, beneath light-slate color, except the inferior sur- 
face of the head, which is yellowish white. A broad longitudinal 
dorsal line of one and two half rows of scales, and an equally distinct 
one on each side on the second and third dorsal rows, of a greenish 
slate. The sides of the abdoaien and the exterior dorsal row are dark- 
slate brown. When the skin is stretched, there are seen on each side, 
between the dorsal and lateral rows, two rows of quadrate black 
blotches, the first quite distinct, between the third and sixth rows; the 
second between the sixth and vertebral line, the spots continent above 
with each other; the blotches about one scale apart. The intervals 
between the blotches of a vivid brick red, which color, as well as the 
black, is sometimes seen on the bases of the adjoining scales, ^oneof 
the short white lines of IJ. fiirtalis are visible. More or less of white 
on the inferior surface of the tail. No spots on end of gastrosteges. 

The color wlien living, as described by Say, is dark-brown above, 
beneath bluish green, head beneath white. A vertebral greenish 
yellow line, and a lateral pale-yellow one; about eighty concealed red 
spots or semifascia^ on the skin and lateral margin of the scales.

ined, the tbllowiug results were obtained. Four and three-quarters

2; four and one-hftb, 1; four and one tenth, 4; four and one-twelfth, 1; 
four and one-fifteenth, 1; four, 3; three and seven-eighths, 1; three and 
six sevenths, 1; three and five-sixths, 1; three and six- sevenths, 1. 

Variations in color exist which connect the JiJ. s. parietalis with 
several other subspecies. Thus in Oat. Nos. 954 and 7798 the superior 
row of spots is obsolete on the posterior two-thirds of the length and 
the dorsal stripe is bordered by a narrow black line, thus approaching 
the -E/. s. dorsalis. In Oat. Nos. 664 and 4775, both from Kansas, and a 
specimen in my private collection from Fort Harker, Kansas, the spots 
of the superior row are distinct, and not confluent into a band. This 
form differs from the E. s. sirtalis only in having the spaces between the 
spots red instead of olive brown or green. Oat. No. 8374 has the same 

character. In some spec- 
imens from Oregon the 
red spaces between the 
spots of the inferior row 
are very much c o n - 
tracted, and in some 
nearly closed, with black, 
thus approaching most 
closely the form JE. s. tri- 
lineata of the Pacific 
coast. Finally, in four 
specimens from Oalifor- 
nia there are eight supe- 
rior labials, regularly 
arranged. In two of 
these, from San Francisco (Oat. Nos. 865, 893), the confluence of the 
spots of the superior row with each other and with those of the lower 
row is imperfect, and on the hinder part of the length nonexistent. In 
the others (Oat. Nos. 864, 896) the colors on the posterior half of the 
body are arranged as in E. s. dorsalis^ the anterior half conforming to 
the definition of the IJ. h. parictaliH. 

This subspecies represents the E. s. siirtalu in the central region of 
North America, which it completely replaces. It is the most abundant 
species of the northern parts of the Pacific region, ranging from Walla 
Walla to the coast, and as far south as Fresno, Oalifornia. On the 
coast proper it is associated with three other subspecies. Its habits 
are semiaquatic. I have seen it in large numbers on the shores of the 
lakes of Oregon, where it lies in wait for frogs, toads, etc. It haunts 
the high grass of the creeks and rivers of the great plains, in which 
it quickly glides when j)ursued. 

Mr. S. N. Phoads, in his exploration in British Oolumbia in 1892, 
obtained three specimens from Ilatzic, two from Sicamoos, British

Columbia, and one from Nelson and A'enion, Britisli Oolmnbia, respec- 
tively. Constant to its characters in the interior, but the three speci- 
mens from ITatzic show an approach to the trilineata form. This is 
produced by a diminution in the size of the red spots anteriorly, and 
their obliteration on the posterior part of the body and on the tail.

EUTi^NIA SIRTALIS TETRAT^ENIA Cope. 

Eutania sirtaUs letratwtiia Yarrow, Re]»ort Rejitilfs U. S. Geog. Surv. W. of 100th 
Mer., V, 1875, p. 546. 

Leiij^th of tail entering the total length four and one-fifth times. The 
superior labials eight, the anterior rather crowded, so that it may be 
the normal number is seven instead of eight, in which case this form 
should be referred to the ?J, .^irtaUs rather than to the IJ, infernal is 
The loreal is as high as long, and the temporals are 1-2-3. The frontal 
wider than the superciliaries, and does not reach the preocular. The 
])ostgcneials are longer than the pregeneials. Gastrosteges, one hun- 
dred and fifty-eight; urosteges, sixty eight. 

Mcttsurements. — Total length, 800 mm. ; length of tail (tip lost), 118 mm. 
The ground color is seen in the dorsal stripe and in the belly as high as 

the third row of scales, inclu- 
sive. This is bluish olivaceous. 
The scales mentioned are black 
at their bases and on their ad- 
jacent edges, and in the first 
row of scales the black covers 
the angular extremity of the 
gastrosteges. No regular spots 
on the gastrosteges, as in most 
subspecies of 1/. sirfalis. There 
is no distinct lateral strii)e. 
The dorsal stripe covers one 
and two half rows of scales. 
Externally on each side it is 
bounded by a black stripe, 
which also covers one and two 
half rows of scales, and which 
extends to the base of the tail. Exterior to this on each side is a red 
stripe, which also covers one and two half rows of scales. Exterior to 
this on each side is a second black stripe on each side, which covers one 
and a half rows of scales, and extends to the base of the tail, beyond 
which it is broken up into a series of black spots. It is also broken up 
into spots for a short distance posterior to the head. These spots have 
no connection with the superior black baud. Head olive gray, with two 
pale parietal spots; no nuchal spots. Superior labials with narrow 
black posterior borders on the fourth, fifth, and sixth. Throat and chin 
yellowish, unspotted; no black marks on middle of belly and tail below. 
The color pattern of this subspecies is entirely difi"erent from that of 
any other, and is the result of a confluence of the sjjots, one phase of 
whicli is seen in the E. sirtalis concinna. As in that form, the inferior 
row of spots has become a longitudinal band ; but, unlike that form, the 
red spaces between the superior row of spots has also become a stripe, 
instead of remaining separate.

Head small; body rather stout. Black, with a dorsal ]\ght stripe, 
and the usual two rows of lateral spot.s and stripe replaced by a single 
series of distinct salmon-colored spots. 

Above, intense black, with a dorsal j^^reenish white line one and two 
half scales wide, and extending from head to tip of tail. On each side 
is a series of vertically elongated distinct spots of a reddish salmon 
color, and seventy-five in number between the head and anus. They 
occur on the second to the sixth rows of scales, and are half a scale 
long, the same color being visible on the adjoinin.u' skin. The dark 
intervals are one scale longer than the spots themselves. Beneath, 
greenish black, tinged with white anteriorly. Whole head reddish 
yellow, tinged above with brown. 

This subspecies carries the fusion of colors further than the IJ. -s. 
parietalis^ since thebelly is black. This color joins that of the inferior 
series of black spots, and as the superior series are continent, the 
intervals between the former are isolated.

total length. Gastrosteges, 103; urosteges, 8.").

In this subspecies melanism is carried farther than in any of the 

others. The typical specimen is of an intense black, tinged with bluish 

below. There is a very nar- 
row greenish white vertebral 
line, beginning at the nape, 
where it occupies one and 
two half scales, and gradu- 
ally narrows to the carina 
of the middle dorsal row, 
becoming obsolete at the 
anus. The carina? of the 
second and third rows of 
exterior dorsal scales show 
the faint line of greenish 
white, only perceptible on 
close observation. The 

lores, labials, cheeks, and head beneath, greenish white, gradually 

shading into the blue-black of the abdomen at or about the anterior 

fifth. Scuta, 158-1-73.

the vertebral line occupies cue and two half scales throughout. The 
black on each side appears formed by the confluence above of about 
seventy-six spots from head to anus, each spot from oue and one-half 
to two scales long. In other words, there is a stri})e of black three and 
one-half scales wide on each side of the vertebral line, confluent with 
which is a series of black spots on each side, as indicated. The lateral 
stripe is ou the second lateral row of scales, of a greenish white color, 
and confluent with the intervals of the spots, also of the same color. 
The stripe is not well defined, but swells and narrows like a knotted 
cord. Exterior row of dorsal scales and sides of abdomen deep blue- 
black, becoming greenish toward the middle of the abdomen; anteriorly 
the color shows more white. The intervals between the lateral spots

above and beliind it is miieli larger and elongated; tbe upper one, 
somewhat smaller than tbe last, is in contact witb tbe occipitals. On 
one side in tbis specimen tbe large middle temporal is divided into two 
portions, tbe anterior being the smaller. Two scales in second row on 
both sides. 

Twenty-one dorsal rows of scales, the outer one but little larger tlian 
the second, the former smooth anteriorly, faintly carinated toward tbe 
tail; carime on tbe remaining rows increasing toward the dorsal line. 

A golden yellow stripe occupies tbe median row of scales from nape 
to tip of tail, widening slightly on tbe edges of tbe contiguous rows at 
the anterior end; a lateral stripe of same color very indistinct anteriorly, 
where it is mostly confined to the third row, but better defined on tbe 
posterior third of tbe body, where it invades the upper half of the sec- 
ond. Color above the laterals brownish olive witb two series of alter- 
nating dark spots (sixty-six pairs in tbis specimen from head to anus), 
tbe lower series on the fourth, fifth, and sixth rows, the upper on tbe 
seventh, eighth, and ninth; below tbe lateral lines, the first and lower 
half of tbe second rows (anteriorly, occasionally to tbe lower half of 
the third) with tbe ends of the abdominal scutellte, are lustrous pitch- 
black. Tbe upper surface of the head in front of tbe occipitals is 
greenish olive; behind that, to tbe neck and tbe sides of tbe head, 
including the seventh and eighth superior labials, blackish brown, 
slightly maculated witb dull chestnut just behind the occipitals, the 
dorsal yellow line being slightly indicated on tbe dark patch. Beneath 
white, with a creamy tinge anteriorly, becoming jiale greenish on the 
subcaudals. The labials are margined with blackish brown; a post- 
oral cream-colored crescent with the concave side forward; a similar 
band passing down on tbe postorbitals widens on the sixth ui)per labial 
and runs into the throat color, and a third light band is indicated on 
the anteorbital, becoming lost on tbe fourth upper labial. Iris bright 
copper color. Scuta, 15G-1-G3. 

Measurements. ^Total length, 510 mm.; length of tail, 110 mm. 

Tbe general affinity of the species is to the i/. eleyans jnaniana, since 
when the epidermis is removed tbe spots have much the same character. 
It is especially characterized by tbe large number of temi)()ral scales 
of tbe first row, which are more numerous than in any other species of 
the genus. The contact of tbe preocular and frontal plates is also 
uncommon. The broad black lateral band is characteristic. 

Tbe only specimen known was taken near Tucson, Arizona, and was 
sent to tbe zoological garden of Philadelphia by Mr. Herbert Brown. 
During life it was of an aggressive disposition, like several other spe- 
cies of tbe genus. It is now in tbe museum of the Philadelphia Acad- 
emy of Natural Sciences.

its fK'ular plates, having tliem 2-2, 2-o, 1-3, or 2-4, 2-3 being apparently 
the most common arrangement. The food of both these species is the 
Bana montezuma' Baird, and another species allied to U. halecina. The 
life of this lake is in other directions exceedingly prolific, especially in 
fishes and in minute Crustacea. 

I am indebted to my excellent friend. Dr. .lulhis Flolir, of the city 
of Mexico, for a canoe excursion on the lake Xocliimiico, Avlii(^h is 17 
miles from the city, in the valley of Mexico. Here I had an opportunity 
of seeing the botany and zoology of the very irregular shores, which 
are so curiously constructed by the art of the natives. The shores are 
indented in the form of long, narrow docks, and extended in the form 
of piers into the waters of the lake. The ends of these piers are some- 
times more or less detached below, so as to be readily moved, from 
which the later statements regarding the tloating islands have origi- 
nated. The piers are planted with crops of vegetables or flowers, which 
are sold in the adjacent city. 

The ends and shores of the piers are the resting place of innumera- 
ble water snakes, which can be readily observed from a canoe. The 
wife of our Indian boatman was i^articularly acute in detecting these 
animals before either my friend or myself could see them. We caught 
a considerable number, and found that they belong to the two species 
above named. The habits of the two differ somewhat. The U. macro- 
stemma is the more active, sooner seeking the water, where it swims, 
keeping close to the shore, and remaining more or less in sight until it 
conceals itself in a hole. The U. melanogaster, on the other hand, lies 
quietly so as to be more easily taken in the hand; but, if it once takes 
to the water, it seeks the depths and is no more seen. It is much less 
disposed to bite than the E. macrostemma; the latter being, like its ally, 
the E. sirtalifi, a very i)ugnacious snake.

posteriorly acute, and much divaricate. Muzzle (juite narrow, eyes 
directed laterally. 

Color above ash gray, with six or seven longitudinal series of brown 
spots. Those of the median two or three rows are sometimes united, 
forming short crossbars. Those of the inferior series are on the first 
row of scales and are blacker than the others. Below creamy ashen,

darker brown markings as follows: A dark shade in the middle of each 

parietal; a narrow X open- 
ing forward on the frontal ; 
a longitudinal line on each 
suj^erciliary, and a trans- 
verse waved line across 
each prefrontal. 

The above description is 
taken from the typical 
specimen which I caught 
in the San Francisco Kiver, 
which is one of the head 
tributaries of the Gila, in 
south wes;ern New Mexico. 
Subsequently the I^ational 
Museum received numer- 
ous specimens from near 
the city of Chihuahua, 
Mexico, Avhere it is evi- 
dently abundant. The specimens display a remarkable variability in 
coloration, and also prove that the azygous plate which exists between 
the prenasal plates of the typical specimen, is an abnormality. In one 
of the Chihuahua specimens there is an azygous plate between the 
internasals, which is of shorter form than in the type; while in another 
there is an azygous plate between the prefrontals. In all of the others 
azygous i^lates are wanting. The ocular plates ai'e normally 3-3, but 
tlie following variations occur: 2-3 — 2-3, one; 2-3 — 3-3, one; 2-2 — 3-3, 
one. The loreal is normally quite elongate; in one specimen it is short- 
ened. The color varies from uniform brown above, to spotted in two 
styles. In one of these there are seven rows of brown spots with paler 
or rufous centers; in the other the brown borders of the spots have 
disappeared, and the rusty centers are represented by small rusty 
orange spots. The under surfaces are yellow, the gastrosteges with

its long compressed muzzle, as well as by its peculiarities of squamation. 
The only specimen of this species which I have seen living was taken 
in a seine net with which I was fishing near the bank of the San Fran- 
cisco River. It dove into the net, seeking the bottom of the water as 
a i)lace of concealment, as is the habit of the E. oneJanofjasfer, and con- 
trary to that of the U. satirita and U. macrostemma, which swim prefer- 
ably on the surface, seeking concealment under the banks.

laterally. Xasal long and rather narrow, slightly recurved on the ui)per 
face of the muzzle in front. Loreal elongate, and with convex superior 
border, passing partly below the superior part of the preocular. Pre- 
ocular higher than wide, in contact with frontal. The latter plate elon- 
gate and obtuse behind, wider than superciliaries. Parietals elongate. 
Temporals 1-4, the anterior large, bounding the sixth and seventh supe- 
rior labials. Postoculars three. Superior labials eight, all longer than 
deej), the last small; the fourth and fifth bounding the orbit below ; the 
sixth and seventh bounded by the anterior temi)oral above. ^Slnc inle-

rior labials; geneials elongate, the pair subequal. The head is an elon- 
gate oval, narrowed anteriorly, and quite distinct from the neck. Tlie 
tail is one-fourth the total length. Scales in twenty-one longitudinal 
rows, all strongl}^ keeled except the lirst and second on each side; all 
poreless. Gastrosteges one hundred and seventy - seven ; urosteges 
entire, four; divided, thirty-three. 

General color above light brown, olive sliaded on the iiead. The 
anterior half of the body is marked with six rows of small alternating 
bright rufous or orange spots, each of which occupies one, and some- 
times an adjoining scale. They stand on the first and second, the fifth, 
and on the eighth rows, respectively. On the posterior third of the 
length they are wanting, and are indistinct posterior to the middle of 
the length. The lower surfaces are pale brownish gray; the base of 
each gastrostege with blackish markings. Labial plates light;' head 
without spots. There is an inferior preocular higher than long on one 
side of this specimen. 

This species is nearly related to the I], multimaculata, and better 
specimens may prove them to be identical. However, there is a con- 
stant difference in the shape of the rostral plate, which has the form 
usual in Eutcenia in the IJ. mnltimacnlata, while it is so peculiar in the 
present species as to have given ground for its separation in a dis- 
tinct genus. This plate is obliquely truncated laterally and produced 
posteriorly at the middle of the posterior border, in the U. multimaculata; 
while it is low and truncate posteriorly, having a transversely ovate 
form in the E. rufopunctata. Its border is slightly free all round in 
the latter, which it is not in the former; but this appearance may be a 
result of drying, though I do not see exactly how it can have so arisen. 
This species further differs from the E . multimav7ilata in thetwo superior 
labials entering the orbit; in the rather more elongate internasals and 
prefrontals; in the more posteriorly-produced loreal, and in the superior 
labials, of which the third nearly enters the orbit. However, some speci- 
mens of the E. multimaculata approach it in one or the other of these 
respects, and the narrowness of the labials has been somewhat exag- 
gerated by the partial drying to which the specimen has been subjected. 
To the same cause may be ascribed some errors in the original figure 
and description. Thus the nasal plates are not confluent, nor does the 
loreal plate quite enter the orbit as has been stated.' The figure omits 
the postocular plates, which were simply turned into the orbit by dry- 
ing. The rostral plate is accurately represented.

CROCODIIJANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 1091 



GLYPHODONTA. 

This superfamily i)resents uo such diversity of character as to indi- 
cate that it embraces more than one family, the Dipsadidix*. The sub- 
families of the Dipsadidae correspond quite closely with those of the 
Colubridae. They are defined as follows : 

I. Ilypapopliyses of vertebra} anterior only. 

Heruipeuis spinous. 

Calyciilate; sulcus nudivided Dipsadin^ 

Calyculate ; sulcus bifurcate Scytalixje 

Not calyculate; an apical disk Erythrolamprin^ 

II. Hypapopbyses extending tbrougbont column. 

Not calyculate; uo basal book nor apical disk HoMALOPSiNiE 

These subfamilies correspond with those of the Colubrid*, as follows : 

Cohibridse. DipsadidiP. 

Xenodoutinae. Erytbrolamprinje. 

Dromicin». Scytalinje. 

Colubriufe. Dipsadinaj. 

Lycodontinas. Homalopsinis. 

The distribution of the subfamilies of corresponding pairs is nearly 
identical. Thus the first two of both columns are South American, and 
the third of both columns is nearly cosmopolitan. The fourth group of 
each column is nearly restricted to the African and Oriental regions. 
Still closer correspondences will be pointed out in the characters of some 
of the genera of corresponding subfamilies. 

ERYXHROL^^lVIPRIlSr^^:. 

In this subfamily the sulcus and hemipenis are bifurcate in the known 
genera. 

I. Heiuipenis generally spinous; disk at tbe extremity of tbe sulcus. 

Coronelliform ; scuta normal Erythrolamjirus Boie 

II. Hemipenis witb spines in two bands only : disk at one side of the sulcus. 
Attenuate; scuta normal; disk papillose; spines joined by a longitudinal mem- 
brane Lyi/ophis Tscbudi. 

Neither of the above genera occur in the Medicolumbiau region. 

I. Hemipenis transversely or obliquely plicate (divided). (Flabellati.) 

No calyces ; rostral plate normal Jaltris Cope. 

Calyces at apex ; rostral plate produced Conojihis Peters. 

II. Calyculate and not capitate. (Calyculati.) 

a. Hemipenis divided. 

Rostral recurved lihinostoma Magler. 

Rostral normal ; pupil erect Oxyrhojius Wagler. 

Rostral normal ; pupil round Philodrijas Wagler. 

aa. Hemipenis undivided. 

Rostral normal Thamnodynasies Wagler. 



1092 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

III. Capitate (also calyculate). (Capitati.) 

Hemipenis undivided; colubriform Coniophanes Hallow eM. 

Hemipenis undivided ; fusiform Hydrocalamus Cope. 

LX. Spinous to apex (divided). (Spinosi.) 

Two nasal plates TacA^mems Wiegmann. 

One nasal plate Tomodon Dum6ril and Bibron. 

IV. Bands of spines extending to apex. (Calycispinosi.) 

Spines of bands minute ; subcaudal scuta ; one-rowed Scytale Wagler. 

The groups into which this subfamily is divided correspond closely 
with those which are found in the subfamily Dromicinse. Group VI, 
including only the genus Meterodon, is the only one of the latter 
which is not represented in the former. Apart from penial characters, 
the genera of the corresponding groups sometimes resemble each other, 
but frequently they do not. Thus, Alsophis resembles Fhilodryas, and 
Eliadincva resembles Coniophanes, and Acanthophallus resembles Tomo- 
don, in general characters. 

This subfamily is exclusively neotropical, with the exception that 
four species of the Central American subregion wander over the border 
into the Toltecau subregion, one of them extending to within the political 
boundaries of the United States at its extreme southern limit. 

MANOLEPIS Cope. 

Manolepis Cope, Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc., 1885, p. 76.— Boulenger, Cat. Snakes 
Brit. Mus., Ill, 1896, p. 120. 

Maxillary teeth equal anterior to the grooved teeth, which are 
enlarged ; anterior mandibular teeth longer than posterior. Head dis- 
tinct from neck; pupil vertical. Scales smooth, pi tless. Nasal plate 
entire or semidivided. Anal and subcaudals divided. 

This genus is allied to Tomodon Dumeril and Bibron, but the pupil 
in that genus is round and the scales have apical pits. As all my 
specimens are females, I have been unable to learn the penial charac- 
ters. But one species of Manolepis is certainly known, but discrepan- 
cies in the figures and descriptions of authors leave the question some- 
what uncertain. The characters are briefly as follows: 

Scales in nineteen rows. Frontal very narrow, three to four times as long as wide; 
light browu with a darker dorsal band M.putnamii Jan.

oval; muzzle produced beyond the labial margin, oblique, truncate in 
profile. Eostral plate flat, not turned backward above; wider than

little bent dowu laterally. Frontal three to four times as long as least 
width; lateral outlines not straight. Supraoculars broad; occipitals 
rather short; longer than broad, the length equal that of the frontal; 
two unequal postoculars in contact with one temporal. One preocular 
just touching frontal ; one longitudinal loreal, higher behind, frequently 
wanting. One elongate nasal, the nostril anterior to its nuddle and 
frequently connected by a suture to the margin below. Superior labials, 
eight; third, fourth, and fifth entering orbit; inferior, ten; five in con- 
tact with pregenials, which are longer than postgenials. Anterior 
maxillary and mandibular teeth longer than median. Pupil round. 
Scales broad, thin, poreless, in nineteen rows. Tail rather slender. 
Gastrosteges, 173-9^; one divided anal; urosteges, 69-73. 

Measurements. — End of muzzle to rictus oris, 13 mm.: total length, 
582 mm.; tail, 112 mm. 

General color light brown, punctulate with dark brown, especially 
thickly on head and sides. A darker brown band three and two half 
scales wide, from occiput to end of tail, which is nearly broken into 
spots on the nape. Ends of scuta and first two rows of scales darker, 
especially anteriorly where the band is sooty and spreads over the lips 
and chin; a faint longitudinal band above the shade; a short yellow, 
dark bordered streak from postorbitals to penultimate labial. Abdomen 
with many short punctulate streaks. With age the bands become more 
indistinct, so that nothing remains of the one on the dorsal region but 
its external borders. 

Of the seven specimens at my disposal three have a loreal plate and 
four have none, its place being taken by the decurved prefrontal. In 
one specimen there are eight superior labials, the excess appearing in 
front of the line of the orbit. 

In all of my specimens the frontal plate is relatively narrower than 
in the specimens figured by Jan, and described by Boulenger. Its least 
width enters the length from three to four times, while those authors 
give it as entering two and a half times.

According to Boulenger, the British Museum has received this spe- 
cies from La Cumbre de los Arrastrados, in the State of Jalisco, Mexico, 
from an elevation of 8,500 feet. This habitat brings it within the Medi- 

' My original description gives the gastrosteges as one hundred and eighty-six, but 
in none of the five specimens at my disposal does the number exceed one hundred 
and seventy-nine. The former number is probably a misprint for one hundred and 
seventy-six.

coliimbiau region, although the si)ecimeus iu the U. S. Natioual Museum 
are from the Tierra Calieute. 
Sumichrast says of this species : 

This serpent is peculiar to western Mexico. It is not common and is found 
especially in sandy regions, sometimes iu the interior of the forest, sometimes on 
the borders of streams. Its extreme agility renders its capture difficult. Without 
being aquatic, it has the manners of the Tropidonoti, with which one is inclined to 
confound it on first sight, if the retrouse muzzle did not give it an entirely peculiar 
expression. 

I would add that the black color round the mouth and chin adds to 
its decidedly suspicious physiognomy. 

There is some doubt as to the correct name of this species. The 
description of Jan iu 1863 is scarcely sufScient to sustain his name, and 
in 1862 I described a species as Liophis putnamii — a species which 
belongs to the genus Dromicus. It was not, however, called Dromicus 
putnamii until after 1863.

Elongated grooved tooth separated from others by an interspace. 
Hemipenis bifurcate, apex with a few calyces, between which and the 
spinous portion it is flounced. Eostral plate prominent, decurved, 
concave below. Scales smooth; anal and subcaudals divided. Nasals 
divided, nostril bordering internasal plate. 

This genus holds a rather isolated position among American genera, 
but it is quite similar to and probably allied to the genus BhampMopMs 
Peters, which inhabits the sandy parts of Africa. Both genera have the 
decurved muzzle and claw-like rostral plate, which is designed for 
scooping a cavity iu the soil by a downward movement, as opposed to 
the upward movement usual in other snakes.

Conophis aumichrastii Cope, Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci. Pbila., 1875, p. 137. 

Dorsal surface gray, brown, or bluish white; three longitudinal dark- 
brown stripes or bands originate at the muzzle, of which the two lateral 
pass through the eye and along the sides of the body to the end of the 
tail. The median stripe divides into two on the nape and continues 
separate to the end of the tail. Two nasal shields, one frenal, one 
preorbital; two postorbitals ; seven supralabials, of which the third 
and fourth are in contact with the eye; between the fifth and sixth and 
the parietals two long temporals; above the seventh, three; then more 
rows of temi)oral shields. Nine infralabials, of which the first is in 
contact, behind the mental, with its fellow of the opposite side, and the 
pentagonal fifth largest; two pairs of submeutalia, of which the anterior 
is the larger. Dorsal scales rhomboidal, larger at sides, in nineteen 
longitudinal rows. Gastrosteges, according to Boulenger, 147-163; 
urosteges, 57-70 pairs, 

There are three forms, probably subspecies of the G. vittatus, which 
difler as follows: 

Three dorsal stripes; median five scales and lateral four scales wide. 

C. V. ridens Cope. 
Four dorsal stripes, each oue and two hall-scales wide; frontal plate twice as long 
as wide and ecjnal length of muzzle in front of it; temporals 2-3. 

C. V. vittatus Peters. 

Stripes as in C. v. vittatus; frontal plate 2.5 times as long as wide and longer than 

muzzle in front of it; temporals 3-3 C.v, su7nichrastii Cope 

Of these subspecies the U. S. National Museum possesses one specimen 
of the G. V. videns from Tehuan tepee, from F. Sumichrast; four of the 
G. V. vittatus from Colina, from J. Xantus, and one from Tehuantepec, 
from Sumichrast; and one of the G.v.sumichrastii from Guadalajara, 
from J. J. Major.

Conophis sumichrastii Cope, Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1875, ii. 137. 
While this form resembles the typical subspecies in coloration, the 
form of the head and of its plates differs considerably. The muzzle is 
narrower, so that the prefrontals have a relatively greater anteropos- 
terior extent. The greater relative elongation is seen in the frontal 
plate as shown in the diagnosis, an elongation in which the supraoculars

Posterior maxillary teeth elongate, grooved; cephalic shield normal; 
two nasals; loreal present. Scales smooth, without fossa. Anal and 
subcaudal scuta divided. Pupil round. 

This genus is restricted to Central America and the adjacent parts 
of the Columbian region, since a species (0. dromiciformis) is found on 
the Pacific slope of the Andes, near the equator. The remaining nine 
siiecies belong to Central America and Mexico, and one of them has 
been taken iu the United States, on the lower Eio Grande. The typical 
species are brown or red, with black stripes, and are of delicate and 
handsome tints. Another pattern is seen in the U. lateritius Cope, of 
western Mexico, which is a red species, with black head and neck. 
The species known to me are characterized as follows: 

I. Scales iu twenty-five longitudinal rows. 

Superior labials, eight ; three broad longitudinal black bands . . C. jnceivitiis Cope. 

II. Scales in twenty-one rows; labials, eight.

Size rather small ; scales in nineteen longitudinal rows, thin, elongate, 
obtuse. Head scarcely distinct, short profile of muzzle not elevated. 
Anterior i^lates of the head small; loreal a little longer than high; one 
preocular, two postoculars. Superior labials seven, third and fourth en- 
tering the orbit. Vertical plate elongate, lateral borders convergent, i>os- 
terior angle acute. Occipitals long. Inferior labials nine; geneials two 
pairs, nearly equal. Gastrosteges 118-130, anal divided; urosteges 82. 

Measurements. — Length of tail, 133 mm.; total length, 362 mm. The 
stumj) of the tail appears tetragonal in section. Coloration above, light 
brown, every scale densely punctulated with darker, especially near the 
margins. From the first to the fourth row of scales this is deeper, giving 
the sides a darker sliade. The vertebral row of scales from the occipitals 
to the end of the tail is also darker. Top of the head densely and 
obscurely vermiculated and punctulated. The dark shade on the fourth 
row of scales becomes a band anteriorly, and is bordered above and 
below with white on the neck. The lower white border is discontinued 
on the neck, but reappears as a spot three scales back of the occipitals. 
Inferior half of rostral, upper and lower labials, chin, throat, and belly 
light brownish yellow, densely i)unctulated with brown. Each labial 
with a darker spot in the center. Fewer punctulations on the urosteges. 

This form differs from the typical G. imperialis not only in its very 
narrow dorsal stripe, but normally has onl}^ seven superior labials. This 
character is, however, inconstant, and it is probably best to look upon 
the form as a subspecies of the C imperialis.

Erytlirolamprus imperialia Cope, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., No. 32, 1887, p. 77. 

Form slender, tail short. Head proportionally narrow posteriorly 
and broad on the nose; snout rounded. Eostral gibbous, twice as 

broad as high, the apex below the 
anterior frontals. Loreal as high 
as long, and more than half as 
large as the anterior frontals, 
which are themselves about one- 
third the size of the postfrontals. 
The frontal is pentagonal, nar- 
row, and elongated, scarcely 
wider anteriorly, the acute pos- 
terior point entering between the 
oecipitals; one anteorbital large, 
vertically elongated, broader 
above; two postorbitals small, upper largest. Dorsal scales smooth, in 
nineteen rows; central scales narrow and acute, outer rows much 
broader, especially the first. Body above deep purplish black, with 
two dorsal stripes of yellowish brown from head to tip of tail, and 
separated by a narrower vertebral line of the ground color. Head 
black above, with two narrow yellow lines from the nostrils to the 
sides of the occiput, crossing the upper angle of the orbit. Upper 
labials and under i)art of head yellowish, minutely mottled with black. 
Ground color of the back extending onto the ends of the abdominal 
scutellte. Middle of abdomen uniform light yellowish in the alcoholic 
specimen; said to be bright red in life. 

Besides southwest Texas this species has been found near Tuxpan 
by Lincecum and at Jicaltepec, Vera Cruz, by the Geographical Com- 
mission of Mexico.

The wbole body is bright vermillion, punctulated with brown, passing 
through orange to golden on the belly. The head and neck for ten 
scales posteriorly is black, the labials bordered and traversed by yel- 
low lines, and the occipitals dotted with the same. Throat and chin 
yellow ; black spotted. The head is broad i)osterioiiy and the outline 
converged rapidly to the acute prominent muzzle. Loreal square, one 
preocular, two postoculars; seven upper labials; eye over third and 
fourth; fifth very large. Ten inferior labials; scales in nineteen rows. 
Vertical plate nearly as broad as long. Anal divided. 

Measurements. — Total length, 006 mm. Of this the tail is 175 mm. 
in length. 

But one example of this handsome species has come under my obser- 
vation. According to Bouleuger the Tachymenis melanocephala is the 
same. Peters describes his specimen as follows : 

It was founded on a young specimen " which possibly belongs to T.hipunctalus, 
Giinther, with which it agrees in respect to its pholidoisis, and in the punctulatiou of 
the head shields and the markings on the infralabials. The ground color of the 
head, including the najie, to the tenth row of scales posteriorly, is blackish brown, 
behind which there is a yellowish collar around the neck four scales wide, while the 
remainder of the body is yellowish brown above; the underside yellowish, without 
black punctulations."

Trimorphodon Cope, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1861, p. 297; Bull. U. S. Nat. 
Mus., No. 32. 1887, p. 68. 

Posterior maxillary tooth elongate, grooved ; anterior teeth of both 
jaws elongate; intermediate teeth of the maxillary series shorter. 
Head plates normal; two nasals: two loreals, one in front of the other. 
Pupil vertical. Head very distinct. Scales smooth, subequal. Anal 
scutum divided; subcaudal scuta in two series. 

This genus includes species which inhabit Central America, Mexico, 
and the adjacent parts of the United States. It is allied to Sibo7i, 
from which the elongate anterior teeth and the divided anal scuta dis- 
tinguish it. No species of Sibon is known to possess two loreals, one 
anterior to the other. The species of Trimorphodon, with their wide 
triangular head, narrow neck, and slitlike pupil, considerably resemble 
venomous snakes, which their pugnacious disposition does not diminish. 
They differ as follows : 

I. Scales in 21 (23) rows; superior labials nine. 

Head, with brown chevrons above ; nape with a brown collar ; back with diamond- 
shaped spots T. lambda Cope. 

Head with a lyre-shaped pattern above; nape with parallel stripts; dorsal 
spots in jjairs T. lyrophanes Cope. 

II. Scales in 23 rows; superior labials seven. 

Top of head black, with a white T-shaped spot; dorsal spots entire transverse 
diamonds T. tan Cope. 

III. Scales in 23 (24) rows; superior labials eight. 

Top of head brown, with a small Y-shaped mark; dorsal spots transverse dia- 
monds, more or less transversely divided by paler; nape with a brown collar. 

T. tt2)silon Cope. 

IV. Scales in 23 (24) rows; superior labials nine. 

Top of head brown ; dorsal spots numerous transverse more or less divided dia- 
monds T. collar is Cope. 

Top of head white, witli three round black spots; dorsal spot; few transverse 
undivided black rhombs, with iiale edges T. villdusonii Cope. 

V. Scales in 25 (27) rows; superior labials nine. 

Top of head with chevron bands; dorsal spots formed of lour confluent spots 

and inclosing a palecenter T. biscittatus Dumeril and Kibron. 

Of the preceding species I have before nie one each of the T. lambda, tan, cuUarin, 
and filkiiisonii. Of the T.hjrophanes there are six specimens; of the T. iipsilon nix, 
and of the T. biscutatits four. 

The type of the genus is the T. lyrophanes. It is the only species 
found within the limits of the United States.

Scales in twenty-one (in some specimens, for a short distance, in twenty- 
three) rows rather broad i)osteriorly and upon the middle of the body, 
not larger upon the vertebral line. The body anteriorly is slender, 
contracting to a small neck. Tail less than one-sixth of the total length. 
Head very distinct, the temples much swollen, so that the greatest 
breadth in life is just posterior to tlie eyes, though the length of head 
posterior to the angle of the vertical shield is one line greater than that

anterior. Side of the head constricted at the orbits, the muzzle rather 
narrow and truncate. Rostral plate broader than high, with but four 
sutural borders, the superior very long; the apex apparent upon the 
surface of the head. Prefrontals much broader than long; one-third 
the size of that part of the prefrontals visible from above. Upon a 
vertical view, the postfrontals ai)pear longer than broad. Occipitals, 
superciliaries, and vertical developed; the last presenting a right angle 
posteriorly, and having the lateral borders slightly concave and con- 
verging; the first not longer, and about as wide as long, in contact with 
a large scale in their j)osterior, common emargination. Nasal plates 
distinctly divided, very small, higher than long. Loreal plates two, 
the anterior higher than long, intercalated superiorly between the pre- 
frontal and postfrontal, posterior as long as high. Preocculars three, the 
superior largest, not in contact with the vertical ; the inferior bounded 
anteriorly by the third upj)er labial. Postoculars three, the inferior a

little the largest. Superior labials nine, fourth and fifth entering the 
orbit, sixth largest, liigher than broad. Inferior labials twelve, the 
third and fourth narrow, and much produced i)Osteriorly. Geneials two 
pairs, the anterior longest. Gastrosteges, 230; one divided anal; uro- 
steges, 70. 

Measurements. — Total length, 696 mm,; tail, 108 mm. 

Seven teeth upon the superior maxillary bone, of which one posterior 
is elongate and grooved, three central, small and recurved, and three 
anterior, very long, the first longest and least recurved. The central 
three are not separated from those anterior and posterior to them by 
spaces wider than those existing between themselves. Palatine teeth 
six, the anterior three the longest, all longer than the pterygoids. The 
three anterior mandibuhir teeth longer and more widely spaced than 
the posterior, having an outward direction as in Hormonotus Hallowell. 

The ground color is a light gray. The muzzle is crossed by an indis- 
tinct ashy band, which extends upon the anterior part of the post- 
frontals. The posterior half of these plates is involved in a deep brown 
band, which crosses the head between the eyes, and whose posterior 
border is very concave, extending upon the superciliaries to the vertical 
plane of the i)upil of the eye. This band is continued posteriorly upon 
the inferior postocular and sixth upper labial. A pair of broad diverg- 
ing bands begins one band on either side of the center of the vertical, 
crosses the superciliary and occipital shields, and following the 
expanded outline of the temporal and tympanic regions, contracts and 
becomes longitudinal and parallel upon the neck. A brown spot upon 
the posterior extremity of the vertical plates with a posterior elonga- 
tion, comi^letes the resemblance of this figure to a lyre, or still more to 
that musical (?) instrument known to children as the "Jew's-harp." 
The ground color appears upon the vertex as an anchor-shaped figure, 
and on the cheek as an oblique band. The back, as far as the anus, is 
ornamented with twenty-one pairs of deej) brown spots, their gemina- 
tion only apparent anteriorly by the punctulate character of the scales 
in intervals between the pairs. These intervals are alwaj^s about three 
scales wide, the lesser, two and a half anteriorly, one and a lialf pos- 
teriorly. Dorsal spots seven scales wide; as the scales are broader 
posteriorly, the spots are also. There is an irregular series of lateral 
spots, one opposite each of the intervals, sojnetimes confluent with the 
dorsal spots ; anteriorly they form a very narrow broken band. Another 
series of spots involves the tips of pairs of the gastrosteges, which are 
separated by two, three, four, or even five immaculate ones. Ten con- 
fluent pairs of spots on the upper surface of the tail. Whole under 
surface whitish. 

This species is most nearly allied to the T. lambda Cope. From this 
one it will be always distinguished by the two ])arallel strii)es on the 
neck, which extend to the sujierciliary plates. Sometimes (Cat. No. 
8760) the stripes do not connect witli the superciliary stripes and Join 
on the parietal plates.

every third or fourth gastrostege there is a small black spot through- 
out the length to the tail. There is a larger black spot on the sides 
between the extremities of a few of the cross bands. The superior bor- 
der of the sixth and the adjacent part of the fifth superior labial is 
black. On the top of the head are three large round black spots; one 
is on the center of the frontal and one is on the anterior part of each 
parietal. No cross bands on the muzzle. The dark cross bands are 
only two scales wide on the posterior part of the body; on the anterior 
part they are three or four scales wide. The interspaces vary from 
twelve anteriorly to seven posteriorly. 

One specimen, Cat. No. 14268, was sent from near the city of Chihua- 
hua by Mr. Edward Wilkinson to the U. S. National Museum. This 
species is nearest the T. hiscntatus Duraeril and Bibron in squamation, 
but differs greatly in coloration from this or any other species of the 
genus.

An elongate grooved tooth on the posterior part of the maxillary 
bone; other teeth subequal. Head plates normal ; one loreal. Preaual 
and subcaudal scuta double; scales smooth, with two apical pits. 
Pupil vertical. Hemipeuis undivided with bifurcate sulcus spermaticus, 
and numerous spines below and calyces above. The latter present a 
free margin to the superior spinous region, that is, the organ is capitate. 

This genus has near allies among the Dipsadine group, to which it 
belongs. From Dipsas it is distinguished by the divided preanal plate; 
from Himantodes by the double scale-pits, that genus having but one. 
From Trimorphodon it differs in the equality of the ungrooved maxil- 
lary teeth and the single loreal plate. The greater number of species 
of this genus are Mexican and Central American, one species {S. annu- 
latum) extending its range throughout tropical South America. One 
species only has been found on the Rio Grande River, and extends 
within our borders. The species are closely allied and are subject to 
some variation. One only (;S^. rhombiferum Giinther) I have not seen, 
and I give its characters on the authority of Oiiuther. All the spe- 
cies known have but one temporal plate in the first row. 

In some of the forms the head is less distinct j)osteriorly than is 
cbaracteristic of the typical genera of this subfamily, giving a coronel- 
line form and forming a transition to the more fusiform types. 

The 8. annulatum is the only species which ranges over Brazil ; the 
others are all Central American ( = Mexican).

Two species of this geims are known from the Central American 
region of the neotropical realm. These are the S. atrocinctii.s Schlegel, 
of the strictly Central American countries, and the S. niie/toacanensis^ 
Duges, of Mexico proper. To these Boulenger adds my species, Pro- 
cinura wmula, whicb I referred to a distinct genus on account of the 
tubercular carination of the robust tail. This is very different from the 
characteristic of the other species, where the tajl is smooth and slender. 
However, the value of this character may be for the present problem- 
atical, so I i^rovisionally follow the Catalogue of the British Museum.

caudal series are keeled, aud as they are wider tliau long, the free apices 
of the keel, projecting, give them a depressed pyramidal form. Gastros- 
teges, 148; urosteges, 41. 

In the coloration of the body this si)ecies is an almost exact repeti- 
tion of the Elaps fulvius. It is surrounded by wide black rings, which 
are broadly bordered with yellow and separated by red interspaces of 
twice their width. The scales of the red spaces have each a central 
black spot, which is more distinct than in E. fulmuH^ on the anterior 
part of the body, above the sides; posteriorly they are weaker. The 
black annuli pass round the belly, but are all somewhat broken ante- 
riorly. Between them the gast rosteges have black shades. The (colora- 
tion of the head differs from that of the E. fulvius in having merely a 
large black spot covering tlie parietal, superciliary, and frontal plates, 
and extending round the eye, but not reaching the edge of the lip. 
Muzzle and chin unspotted. 

Measurements. — Total length, 364 mm. ; length of rictus oris, 11 mm.; 
length of tail, (>1 mm. 

Although this curious and handsome serpent so much resembles the 
Elaps fulvius, it is not yet known that the two species inhabit the 
same region. 

This species is near to Scolecophis atrocinetus, but the i^eculiar tuber- 
cular carination of the tail distinguishes it. It inhabits a rocky, moun- 
tainous region, and I have little doubt that this peculiar character 
enables the animal to force itself into the earth or beneath stones. The 
tail is used as a- fulcrum in pushing against rough aud resistant bodies.

and does not therefore belong to this geuns. It has not been observed 
by American naturalists. It is said to have seven superior labials, and 
the scales in 15 series. It is reddish white above, with a black half 
color on the nape. This is separated from the dusky top of the head by 
a white cross band, and there is a white spot behind the eye.

The individual on which was based the T. hallowellii differs from the 
usual form in having a longer muzzle, so that the postnasal and pre- 

ocular scuta do not touch, ])ermit- 
ting the contact of the postfrontal 
and labial scuta. The first tempo- 
ral also separates the fourth and 
fifth superior labials more exten- 
sively than usual. To the latter 
character I find ajjproaches in sev- 
eral specimens, but the former is 
repeated on one side of one speci- 
men only, which is from San 
Diego, southwestern Texas. 1 
think the supposed species represents only an extreme individual vari- 
ation. In Cat. No. 21218 there is a small inferior postocular on one side. 
This species is common in southwestern Texas.

Uniform reddish above, of a soiled white beneath, Avith *a black ])atch on the 
occiput and the beginning of the neck. 

Body slender, rather elongated, cylindrical; head small, depressed, but little 
distinct; snout short and elliptical; tail rather long, slender, and very much taper- 
ing, one-fourth of the total length. Nostrils lateral, very small, situated in the 
middle of the nasal, which is elongated and single. Eyes of medium size. Mouth

The geographical distribution of these genera is East Indian. 

The habit of the subfamily is aquatic, and it embraces the fresh-water 
snakes of all countries. Many of the East Indian forms are partially 
marine, living in tide water or on the coast, as Homalopsis, Cerberus, 
etc. Hijnstes imitates in its appearance the sea snakes, and is often 
taken with them, and with eels, in their nets by the Malay fishermen. 
Herpeton inhabits the Cambodia and other rivers of Farther India, and 
has a vegetable diet. Most of the other aquatic genera are piscivorus. 

PROTEROGLYPHA. 

I have been able to examine a limited number of species of this 
superfamily, and must therefore present an imperfect synopsis of the 
genera. I have examined enough of the species to affirm that they 
present variations of type similar to those seen among the superfami- 
lies already considered. All the forms that I have seen have a bifurcate 
sulcus and all are spinous. 

There are three families, as follows : 

A postfrontal hone; fang grooved Najid^. 

No postfrontal hone ; fang grooved Elapid.e. 

A postfrontal hone ; fang not grooved in front Dendraspid^.

The geographical distribution of the species of this family is as 
follows : 



Paleotropical. 



Ogmoilon 



Bimgarus. 



Megferophis . 

Na.fa , 

Ophiophagus 



Callophia . 



Palearctic.

Pseudechis. 
Hoplocephalus. 
Tropidechis. 



Dienienia. 
Pseudonaja. 
Furlua. 
Cacophis, 



Rhiuelaps. 
Acanthophis. 



It is to be observed that much the largest number of genera belong 
to the Australian realm. The majority of the species belong als6 to 
Australia, the genus Denisonia alone including some nineteen species. 
The genus Ogmodon with one species belongs to the Fiji Islands only. 
No genus or species occurs in the Western Hemisphere, wliere they 
are represented by the Elapid*. 

The Najidai, although of an organization inferior to that of the 
Solenoglypha, embraces some of the most venomous snakes known to 
us. Such are the species of Ophiophagus, Naja, and Bungarus, in India, 
and Acanthophis and Pseudechis in Australia. The cobra ( Naja tripudians 
Linnaeus) causes more deaths than any other snake, not only because 
of the energy of its venom, but because of its courage and activity. 
In Australia the Pseudechis porphyriacus (the black snake) causes more 
fatalities than any other. The death adder {Acanthophis antarctiea) is 
a dangerous species, but it is less active in its movements. The Ophio- 
phagus claps of India is the longest venomous snake, reaching a length 
of 12 feet. It is fortunately rare. Many of the smaller Australian 
Najidse are not dangerous. 

ELAPID^. 

The only genera of this family which I have examined are Elaps and 
Yermicella. The hemipenis is alike in both ; that is, it is bifurcate, with 
each half with a spinous apex. The extension of the spines downward 
differs with the species. Thus they extend but a short way in Elaps 
corallinus, but extend far down in in E. surinamensis and E. imperator. 
The usual definitions of the genera are as follows: 

a. luternasal plate touching the uasal laterally. 

One nasal plate Vermicella Gray, 

Two nasal plates Elaps Schneider. 

au. luternasal reaching first labial plate. 

One nasal ; no loreal Microsoma Jan. 

The genus Vermicella is Australian, Elaps is American, and Micro- 
soma is African. The genus Elaps embraces many species, but the 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. HID 

other two genera are represented by not more than two species oacli. 
The species are not dangerous, with the exception of a few of tlie 
hirger species of Elaps.

Maxillary bone without solid teeth behind the perforated tooth. 
Cephalic plates normal; rostral not modified. Two nasal plates; no 
loreal; oculars few. Scales not keeled, without fossa. Subcaudal scu- 
tell.T in two rows; anal plate divided. Pupil a vertical oval. Head lit- 
tle distinct. 

This genus embraces from twenty to thirty species of the neotropical 
realm, three of which have their principal habitat in the southern por- 
tions of the nearctic. They are of rather elongate body and short tail, 
and have small eyes. They approximate in general appearance tbe 
CalamarinB Colubridtie, so that their discrimination, except on exami- 
nation of the dentition, from snakes of this group can only be accom 
plished by experts in species characters. The scutellation of the head 
is exactly that of the genus Tantilla. The coloration is brilliant, con- 
sisting of red and black, with less yellow, arranged in rings or parts of 
rings. The red is generally the ground color, and the black rings are 
either single or in sets of three. The latter may be much narrower 
than the ground color, or may be so wide as to reduce it to very small 
proportions {E. scmipartitus, E. imperator). The epidermis is beauti- 
fully iridescent, especially on the black spaces. The colors are much 
like those of the mineral labradorite, and are probably due to a similar 
physical cause, namely, a mi(;rosco])ic lamination of the surface. On 
direct and antero-posterior views the color is peacock purple; on trans- 
verse views it passes from brassy yellow through brassy green to 
maroon and brown. The colors do not appear if the scales are wet. 

The bite of some of the larger species, as E. surmamensis and E. 
marcgravii, is said to be dangerous, but that of the smaller ones is 
innocuous to man and the larger animals. 

Three species are found within the limits of the nearctic realm, which 
dilfer as follows : 

I. Temporal scales, 1-1; a black ring immediately behind head; internasals nuuh 

smaller than prefrontals. 

Tail one-seventh to one-eighth total length; black rings wide, covering from 7 
to 20 scales; red sjjaces above and below black-spotted; three or four black 
rings on tail; muzzle and chin black E. fiilriiis. 

Tail one-Bcveuth total length; black rings narrow, covering 2-3 scales; red 
spaces above and below not black-s])otted; tail with seven black rings; uose 
and chin red A', distant. 

II. Temporal scales, 1-2; internasals eciual or nearly equal ])refrontals; a red ring 

immediately behind head. 
Tail very short, one-fourteenth total length ; black rings G or 7 scales wide, with 
very wide yellow l)orders; interspaces above and below unspotted; tail with 
two black rings ; uose and chin black E, euryxanth us.

The red may be eonsidered as the ground color of the body, though 
the black rings occupy nearly as much space above as the red, sols 
to give the general appearance of a succession of red and black rings. 
The yellow is intermediate. The anterior part of the head from the 
posterior point of the vertical plate, embracing the orbits, is black, as 
IS also the tip of the lower jaw. A yellow ring passes across the 
occipital region down to the inferior surface of the head, embracing the 
space between the posterior rim of the eye and the angle <.f the mouth. 
Then comes a black ring, covering eight dorsal scales, margined pos- 
teriorly with yellow. From this region to the origin of the tail the

black and red rings, from fourteen to nineteen in number each, alternate, 
being separated from each other by a narrow band of vellow. The black 
rings cover seven entire scales and two halves, the intermediate red 
space five entire scales and two halves, and the yellow either one and 
two half-scales or two halves only. Some red spaces may occasionally 
cover nine and ten scales. The tail is alternately black and yellow; 
the first caudal ring is black, and embraces ten scales: the second is 
yellow, and covers three scales. Two black and two yellow succeed 
and cover the same ground. The tip of the tail is black on five scales. 
The tip may be either black or yellow, for, according to the size, there 
are either three or four black rings. Underneath, the colors arc the 
same, but dull; occasionally one or more black rings may not surround 
the body. The reddish spaces are irregularly blotched wit!, deep hhick, 
as also sometimes on the upper surface. 

Specimens from western Te.vas (Indianola on the Gulf of Mexico and 
the l»ecos Eiver on the north) differ somewhat from those from farther 
east, and furnished the bases for the supposed species F. tcner Baird 
and Girard. Generally the frontal plate is not wider than the super- 
ciluary, but in one specimen it is as wide as in the typical form (Cat. Xo. 
8574). The red spaces are more closely spotted and blotched with 
black, the blotch on the belly being especially large. The yellow bor-

clers are also wider, covering two and one and a lialf rows of scales, while 
those of the typical E.fiilviu.s cover but one. A specimen from New 
Orleans is intermediate in these points of coloration (Cat. No. 4804), and 
in specimens from Pensacola (Cat. No. 8783) and St. Johns Eiver (Cat. 
No. 8230), Florida, the yellow borders are one and a half and even two 
scales Avide. I do not lind the Texau forms to represent a subspecies. 

The number of black rings on the body and tail varies within rather 
narrow limits. I give the following account of them as they occur in 
fifteen specimens. The first number represents those on the body; the 
second that on the tail: 11, 3, Cat. No. 8571; 12, 3, Cat. Nos. 0045,0081, 
1137; 12,4, Cat. Nos. 1135,4804, 8230; 13-3, Cat. No. 7776; 13-4, Cat. 
No. 8783; 14, 4, Cat. Nos. 1142, 4716; 15, 4, Cat. Nos. 1120, 10606, 10674; 
16, 4, Cat. No. 9933 ; 17, 4, Cat. No. 8813. 

In coloration the Flaps fulvius represents the type with single rings 
in approximation to that with triple rings, since the black spots of the 
ground color are most dense next the yellow borders, thus foreshadow- 
ing narrow rings at these points, such as exist in the Elaps lemniscatus. 

The Elaps fulvius ranges from North Carolina (exclusive) to the 
Tierra Templada of the State of Vera Cruz, Mexico. A specimen is in 
the U. S. National Museum from Jalapa.

CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 1123 

Dr. Eiiiar LaMinberu- writes of this species as be observed it in Florida 
as follows: ' 

This is the only species of Elaps I have found in sontli Florithi, where it is latlier 
coniuiou. It is known under several names, as ''coral snake," "Arnericau cobra,'' 
"garter snake," and "candy stick." It is perhaps the most dangerous snake in 
Florida, because it is not so much dreaded as the big rattlesnake or moccasin, though 
being quite as poisonous. As the last mentioned names show, it is regarded as a 
"pretty little snake.'' I'ew })eople know or believe that it is poisonous, it looks so 
harmless, andasatonseiiuencethey catch it and handle it rather roughly; the snake 
gets angry, bites, and a human life is endangered. I know personally of such a case. 
A Swede at Oakland, Orange County, found an Elaps, and because of its beautiful 
color he caught it and tried to put it into a bottle of alcohol. The snake bit him, 
but the wound was not large, and as it did not swell he did not care much about it 
at first. After a while he was taken very sick, went to bed, asked for a physician, 
and drank whisky; but it was then too late. He died the next morning, abont 
twelve hours after the snake had bitten him. During the last hours he was uncon- 
.scious, but before that he suffered most excruciating pains. I have heard of several 
other cases of boys dying from an Elaps bite. 

In other cases people have been bitten by an Elaps fitlrinx without suffering from 
it in any way, but I suppose that in such cases the Elaps had not been able to inject 
any poison into the wound, as it has a rather small month. However that may be, 
I can not agree with Cope that the bite "of the smaller ones (meaning smaller spe- 
cies of Elaps) is innocuous to man and the larger animals." It is to be observed that 
the Elaps bites differentiy from the Crotalids and Viperids. The latter snake throws 
its head forward in striking, and draws it back again immediately. The Elaps 
fnlrius I have seen and heard about have acted in an entirely different manner. The 
poor Swede above mentioned had to pull the snake from the wound, and other speci- 
mens that I had induced to bite into sticks kept the stick in. the mouth for a good 
while. This habit probably signifies an intention to jiress as much poison as possi- 
ble into the wound, whicli makes the snake the more dangerous. Elapx fiilriun is, 
however, a good-natured snake, and it does not l)ite unless it is very much provoked. 
If not handled too roughly, an Elaps may be allowed to crawl on one's hands from 
one to the other. I have allowed it myself once, but I hardly think I would do it 
over again, and would not advise anybody else to try it. 

I have found Elapx ftilvius under logs, and digging in the ground as well as crawl- 
ing about on the surface, but I think it prefers dry land. 

The largest specimen I have seen was from Oakland, Orange County, and meas- 
ured exactly 1 m. from the tip of the nose to the anus, and the tail was 90 mm. This 
big specimen had fourteen black rings on the body and three on the tail. Other 
specimens have but twelve black rings on the body and three on the tail, but one of 
these has four on the tail. The yellow rings cover fro7u one to two rows of scales.

head generally larger than in E. euryxantlius- rostral broad and not as 
high as iu the same. Internasals rather small, and slightly elongated 
laterally ; prefrontals large, pentagonal, as broad as long. Snperciliaries 
quadrangular, elongated, narrow. Frontal pentagonal, rather large, 
but narrow, the pointed posterior extremity inserted between the occip- 
itals, as in E.fuh'ius. 

The ground color of the body in the alcoholic specimen is reddish 
brown, i)robably brighter red in life, with twelve to fourteen very nar- 
row, black rings from head to anus. At the edges of the black rings 
the reddish color becomes indistinctly lighter for half a scale, but there 
is no ATell-detined light ring bordering the black as in the other species. 
On the tail are five to seven broad black bands separated by narrow 
light rings. The anterior part of the head back to the middle of the 
occipitals and the upper jaw to the fourth labial is black, but this 
color does not extend on the lower jaw at all, and the lower edge of the 
rostral and upper labials is light. On the posterior part of the head is

the usual light rings, but situated farther back than in E.fuhnns^ its 
anterior border passing across the middle of the occipitals a little 
behind the vertical, and thence down and forward to the fourth labial, 
expanding below upon the whole of the lower jaw. On the neck, 
behind this light ring, is a black one, about five or six scales iu width, 
which does not run entirely around the body, being interrupted for a 
short distance on the abdomen. Behind this the black annulationsare 
perfect, each four or five scales in width, and separated by intervals of 
fifteen to twenty scales of the ground color. The black aunulations 
are broader on the vertebral region than laterally and beneath, where 
they coviBr three or four dorsal scales and the same number of abdomi- 
nal scutelhe. The black rings on the tail are about eight scales wide, 
and separated by light intervals of only two or three scales. 

The narrow black rings, separated by very wide intervals, will at 
once distinguish this species from any of the others here described. 
There are also no blotches or dots of black on the red intervals, and if 
the colors of the specimen described have not been much altered by 
soaking, the absence of distinct light rings of a third color between

the black and rod ones will form a striking character. Tiie color of the 
light occipital ring and of the light rings on the tail is i)robably yellow 
or white in life. 

The characters which distingnish this species from the Elaps fidrius 
are those of color only, as in structural characters the two are identi- 
cal. Many of the species of the genus differ in such characters only, 
and thej" are often very constant. The present species displays equal 
constancy in the known individuals.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 



The forepart of the head is bhick, but the black, instead of passing 
forward from the anterior part of the occipitals to near the eye and 
thus leaving the three posterior labials yellow, as in E.fulvkis and E. 
distans, involves nearly the whole of the occipitals and passes back- 
ward entirely behind the angle of the mouth, and involves the whole 
of the lower jaw to behind the posterior labial, leaving a broad emar- 
gination in the black on the occiput, in the bottom of which eniargina- 
tion are seen the white posterior tips of the occipitals. Behind this is 
a creamy-white ring (probably yellow in life), which is situated more 
posteriorly than in E.fulviu!^^ and involves only the posterior tip of the 
occipitals and none of the labials. IsText behind this white ring, instead 
of a black ring as in the other species, is a broad light-brick red one 
involving eleven scales. A creamy- white ring three and a half scales 
wide separates this first red ring from a black one eight scales in widtli. 
Behind this are alternate immaculate black and red rings seven or eight 
scales wide, and separated by white rings three to three and a half 
sea es in width. There are eleven black and eleven red rings on the 
body separated by twice as many white ones. The tail is ringed with 
black and white, without any red. All the rings run entirely around 
the body of the same color, and are wholly without spots above and 
below. The plates of the head and peculiar style of coloration in this 
strongly marked species can not be mistaken. The three colors, each 
immaculate, glossy, and clear, form a striking contrast, and the red is 
probably bright carmine in life, thus attbrding the most beautiful col- 
oration liossessed by any North American snake. 

The proportions of the head plates in this species are very different 
from what is observed in E. fulvius and other species, and mark it as 
one of the most distinct species of the genus. Its geographic range 
is the Sonoran region, beyond which it has not been found.

CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 1127 

DENDKASPIDID.E. 

The single genus of this family is eharacterized as follows: 

Sulcus Viifnrcate; liL'iiiiiuMiis .siiii[»li', calycnlate, liecoiniuj; .siiinoiis at middle; no 
teeth 1)ebiud IVaij;; attenuate Dt udru^pis Schlegel. 

This family iucludes a half dozen or so of species of the Ethiopian 
realm. They are of arboreal habits, of green colors, and of elongate 
form. Their bites are dangerous to men. 

But one family, the Hj^drophid.T, is included in this subdivision. 1 
have been able to examine but two genera, Hythus and Hydrophis. 
Specimens of riaturus at my disposal are all females. 

Hemipeuis undivided, spinous to apex, where it is papillose Hydrophis Daudin. 

Hemipeuis bifurcate, spinous to apex Iliidrns Schneider. 

From natural characters the genera are defined as follows. The table 
is mostly compiled from Giinther, in the Reptiles of British India: 

I. Gastrosteges wide, tlat. 

Two pairs of frontal shields I'httunc^ Latreille. 

II. Gastrosteges wide, with two keels. 

Scales imbricate ; one nasal Aipysiinis Lacepede 

Top of head scaly ; two nasals Pclagoph is Pesters and Doria. 

III. Gastrosteges narrow, rudimentary, or absent. 
* Nasals separated by frontals. 

Gastrosteges distinct to vent Jiislira Lacepede 

*" Nasals contiguous. 

Head covered with scales behind Acali/ptus DuiiK-ril and Bibrou. 

Head short, entirely shielded; no symphyseal notch Iludrophis Daudin 

Head moderate, entirely shielded; a deep symphyseal notch 

Euhtjdruia Gray 
Suout long, spatulate Jfj/dnts Shaw. 

The species of this family are aquatic and marine in habitat, and 
they are found in the seas bounding the Paleotropical and Australian 
realms. One species — the Hyclnis bicolor — extends its range across the 
Pacific Ocean and to the coasts of South and Central America, extend- 
ing as far south as Peru and north t*o Mazatlan, Mexico. It has not 
been yet found on the coasts of the L^nited States. Admiral McCauley, 
U. S. ]Sr., informs me that he has sailed through shoals of sea snakes, 
probably Ilydni.s bivolor, oft" the coast of Peru. The genus Hydrophh 
is represented b}^ a considerable number of species, while those of the 
other genera are less numerous. They are mostly dangerous to men 
who venture into the water which they inhabit. The species of 
Platurus are more terrestrial in their habits and are sometimes fouml 
far from the coast. Tlie other species oidy leave the water to depo.sit 
their eggs.

SOLENOGLYPHA. 

The families of this suborder are defined as follows: 

Maxillary bone not excaAated; fang not grooved in front; no postfroutal bone 

Atra( TAspiDiD.K Giintber. 
Maxillary bone not excavated; fang grooved in fiont; a ])ostfrotrtal bone

ViPEKiD.E Gray. 

Maxillary bone excavated by a deep fo.ssa, which opens externally ; fang not grooved 

in i'ront ; a postfrontal bone Cr< >talii).k Graj-. 

The penial characters of the Solenoglypha are like those of the more 
specialized members of the Colubridie, and xavy in the same way, 
except that the sulcus and the organ are always bifurcate. 

ATRACTASPIDID.E. 

The genera of this family are the following: 

Urosteges one-rowed ; anal entire Jtractasjyis Smith. 

Urosteges more or less two-rowed ; anal divided (lotlulaps Cope.' 

The only species in which the hemipenis is known is the Alra(fas2ns 
corpidentus Hallowell. Here the sulcus and entire organ are furcate, and 
spinous to near the extremity. The latter is furnished with wrinkled 
lamina' which inclose a few irregular calyces at' the apex, and below 
these are transverse farthest from the sulcus, and longitudinal nearest 
to it. The spines are in longitudinal series. The ouly species exam- 
ined (7:>. corpulentum Hallowell) is not deeply bifurcate, and the bifurca- 
tion of the sulcus corresponds with that of the organ. 

Several species of Atroctaspis are known from Africa. They are 
ground snakes of snmll and medium size and of dark colors. They 
have the form of some Calamarian genera, with indistinct head and tail 
and snmll eyes. They are not reported to be dangerous. 

CAUSID.E. 

Siibcandals two-rowed; anal entire; scales keeled; rostral ])romineut, with recurved 
border Heterophis Peters. 

Snbcandals and anal plates donlde; scales keeled ; rostral normal.. .Causus Wagler.

Diiiotlipsas Peters. 

Snbcau<lals two-rowed; anal entire; scales smooth; rostral normal, a loreal. and 
one nasal ])late _ JccDiiojihis Bonlenger. 

The only genus which 1 have been able to examine as to the ])enial 
structure is Caiisus. The sulcus and organ are deeply and equally 
bifurcate, and tlie branches are extensively calyculate, while the mediau 
portions are spinous. The calyculate region is traversed by a deep 
groove. The calj-ces are replaced in the groove by depressed laminje. 
The borders of the calyces are serrate in the C. rhombeatus.

Tlie (characters are in general like those of the typical S()lenojjly]»ha. 

The genera of Causithe are Ethiopian, except Azeiniopliis, which is 
Indian, but has not been found out of Farther India. There are three 
species of CauHus, and one each of the other genera. The African 
genera are XaiotUm-Wke, in form, and of terrestrial habits, and the sih'- 
cies of Cansns are generally distributed in Africa. None of the species 
of the family reach a large size.

The ViperidiiP are restricted to tlie Old World; that is, to the Pale- 
arctic, Paleotro]>ical, and Ethiopian regions. The genera are distrib- 
uted as follows: 



Palearctic, 



Paleotropic.il. Ethiopian. 



Yiiiera Dnlioi.i Cerastes. 

r.itis. 
Clotlio. 

Kcliis Efliis. 

Athens. 



The genera Vipera and Cerastes approach close to the con tines of the 
Paleotropical in western Asia. Africa has the greatest number and 
the jnost foiinidable s])eci('s. The best known are the i^uff adder. 7;///.s 
arietaii.s, and the rliinoceros vipers, Clotlio rJiinocrros and ('. iiaKiconns. 
These are large and brightly-colored snakes, of most dangerous char- 
acter. The two Indian si)ecies are even better known for the fatalities 
they occasion. These are the Dahoia russcllii, vv Ticpolonga, and the 
Uchis c((riit<(f((. or Krait. The Daboia is a robust snake of medium 
size, handsomely ornamented M'ith a pattern of large spots in brown 
and yellow. The Krait is a veiy small snake of a light brown, with pale 
spots and delicate lines marking the keels of the scales on the back. 
By reason of its small size it is easily overlooked, and as it is extremely 
venomous, it cau.ses many deaths in India. If makes a scraping or 
rustling noise by folding itself and iubl)ing the scales of its body

together. The species of Cerastes are mostly dwellers in the deserts 
of Africa, Arabia, aud Persia, and, like other desert forms, they are of 
pale colors. They have also horuy i)rocesses, chiefly from the super- 
ciliary region, agreeing in this respect also with the spiny character 
of many desert reptiles and plants. The species of Cerastes are of 
small size, and are very poisonous. The species of Vipera are not 
numerous, aud are distributed in Europe and western and northern 
Asia. The V. herus Limueus is the common viper of northern Euroi^e, 
aud the T. aspis is the as^) of Mediterranean countries. The 1". ammo- 
(lytes, or sand viper, of the latter region has a considerable production 
of the rostral plate, so as to simulate a tactile organ. 

The African tree vipers belong to the genus Atheris. They are of 
rather small size and of bright green and yellow colors, so as to be 
readily concealed in foilage. Their tails are especially prehensile, liiie 
those of the Boid;e. Four species are known. 

CEOTALID.E. 

In the Crotalid.e we have the highest efficiency of the venom appa- 
ratus, and therefore the most specialized type of snake structure. The 
species are predominatingly American, but a number are found in the 
Paleotropical region, a distribution which is almost unparalleled among 
vertebrates. The genera are distributed as follows. None are found 
in the Australian or Ethiopian realms: 



Paleotropical. 



Palearctlc. 



Nearctic. 



Xeotropical. 



Ethiopian. 



Lachesi.s 

Peltopelor . . 

Calloselasma 



Trigonoceplialus . 



Lachesis 

Bothriopsis. 
Botliriecliia . 
Teleniaspis . 
Ophryacus.. 



AncislriMlon . 

Sistriiriis 

Crotalns Crotaln.s . 



Of the above genera, Lachesis embraces the larger number of species, 
and they occur in the Neotropical region everywhere, as well as in 
India and Indo-lVlalaysia. Two especially dangerous species occur in 
America — the L. atrox, of the mainland, and the L. lanceolatus (Fer de 
Lance) of some of the southern islands of the West Indies. Some of 
the species are more or less arboreal, as L. hieoJor, of Brazil, and are 
of green colors, while those which live on the ground are of brown 
hues. The Indian species are largely green in coloration. In Ophrya- 
cus and Teleuraspis we have species with tegumentary processes above 
the eyes. 

The Teleuraspis schlegelii of Central America is an arboreal form, 
which is often found wound around the stems in the center of banana 
bunches. In handling the bunches men are frequently fatally bitten. 
The apecies of Bothriechis are also arboreal, and those of Bothriopsis 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 1131 

are terrestrial. Lache.sis includes a lew species oC large size, and rlie 
caudal ai)ex is much produced in auticipation of the rattle of the true 
rattlesnakes. In Ancistrodon we have robust species of the ground, 
the A. jnseivorns being, however, largely aiiuatic in habit. It is one 
of the largest of the family. Sistrurus includes a few rather small 
s])ecies, which prepare the way for the true rattlesnakes. The latter 
are principally abundant in species in North America and north- 
ern jNIexicQ. The heaviest of all venomous snakes is the Crotalns 
(ulamanteuH of the southern regions of Xorth America, which attains a 
length of 8 feet. Its bite is generally fatal. Other large and dan- 
gerous species are the C. molossus of the United States and Mexican 
boundary region, and the G. durissiiSj which inhabits the warmer regions 
of the Neotropical realm. 
Two subfamilies are readily distinguishable, namely: 

No joiuted epidermal caudal appendix Lacheainw. 

A jointed epidermal structure at the extremity of the tail Crotalina. 

The genera of this subfamily are as follows: 

a. Urosteges two-rowed. 

Top of head scaled ; urosteges four- rowed at end ; a caudal spine . . Lachesis Wagler. 

Like Lachesis, but a spinous scale over the eye Ophryacus Cope. 

Top of head with large imbricate shield-like scales Peltopelor Giinther. 

Top of muzzle scaled ; rest of head shielded Ihjpnale Cope. 

Top of head with nine shields; scales carinate Iritjonocephalus Oppel. 

Top of head with nine shields; scales smooth CaUo-selasma Cope.' 

aa. Urosteges one-rowed. 

Body and tail cyliudric, not prehensile; head scaly Iloihriopsis Peters.

is calyculate, excepting in Ancistrodon, which is flounced, with a ten- 
dency to form calyces opposite the sulcus in A. piscivonis.

1132 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Nine symmetrical plates on top of the Lead, the superciliary bound- 
ing the orbit above. I^asal plates, two. Scales keeled, bifossate. 
Anal plate and caudal scuta undivided. 'No rattle. Body and tail 
cylindric. 

Three species of this genus are known, two of which belong to the 
iNearctic and one to the northern part of the Neotropical realm. They 
are snakes of robust habit and their bite is higlily dangerous. One is 
terrestrial in habit and the other semiaquatic. Tiiey differ as follows: 

I. No loreal; two small plates l>elnii(l tlie parietals; eye resting on labials. 

Scales in 25 rows; brown, with broad lilaokisli-brown cross-bauds with zigzag 
borders, and the lateral centers ])ale and with a median dark spot; a light 
stripe from snperciliary ))late and one from below eye, which reaches labial bor- 
der of last Tipper labial A.j)iscirorus. 

II. Loreal present; no plates behind parietal; eye separated from labials by scales. 
Scales in 2.5 rows; dark grayish with brown cross-bands, wide on the middle 

line, and with imperfect yellow borders; belly black, with transverse yellow 
spots on the sides; a yellow stripe from end of muzzle and superciliary plate; 
and thin yellow stripe on borders of rostral plate and through centers of 

superior labials A. hilineatiis.^ 

Scales in 23 rows; grayish, with copper-colored cross-bands much narrowed on 
the middle line, and witii pale centers laterally; no stripes on head, but a 
color border from middle of orbit to top of last upper labial; belly whitish, 
with black spots on sides A. coniortrix. 

Baird and Girard have proposed to separate the A. piscivorus as 
type of a genus To.vicophh, on account of the ])resence of a ]iair of post- 
parietal scuta and the absence of loreal. The A. hilineatus is, however, 
intermediate between that species and the ^4. contortrix in having 
traces of the posti)arietals and a loreal plate. 

Several characters are common to the species of Ancistrodon, which 
are also found in other genera of Crotalida". As in all genera with scuta 
on the top of the head, the superior plane of the muzzle makes a right 
angle with the sides, forming a strong canthus rostralis, which is con- 
tinued around the apex of the rostral i)late. The fossie of the epider- 
mal scales are situated farther back than in the genera of the harmless 
snakes, and a sunill tuberosity of the true scale fits into each of them. 
There are iVe(iuently several divided urosteges near the end of the tail, 
but their number is irregular, and they are sometimes absent, as in 
Ancistrodon contortrix, Cat. Xo. 103G1. The last of the caudal vertebra^ 
consistsof an osseous splint with acute apex, which is ensheathed in three 
modified scales, two above and one below, which is better developed 
than in most harmless snakes. This process is thrown into rapid vibra- 
tion when itsi)ossessoris alarmed, and produces a buzzing sound when 
among dry leaves or other objects. It foreshadows the rattle of the 
Crotali. It is especially developed in the Neotropical genus Lachesis. 
It is variable in size in the Ancistrodons. 

Uncistrodon hilineatus Giinther, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., (3 ) XII. 1863, p. 364. The U. S. 
National Museum possesses two specimens from Tehuantepcc (west side), Mexico,

No siiperior loreal. Inferior ^-all of orbit bouiuk'd by third labial; 
tweiity-tive dorsal rows of scales. Dark cliestimt-browu, with iiidi.s- 
tiuct vertical dark bars. Line from superciliary alonj; the edjue of the 
head through the middle of the temporal scales. A second line, fronj 
the lowest point of the orbit, parallel to the tirst, across the superior 
labial plates. 

Scales all wide aud strongly keeled, including those on the .sides 
aud back of head, exce])t the inferior row of temporals, which aie 
smooth. First row of dorsal scales with weaker keels than other lows. 
Two nasal plates with the nostrils between them, the anterior deeper, 
the posterior longer, Internasals two, one above the other; the upper 
extending- from the eye to the posterior nasal, the lower linear aud 
forming the upper wall of the pit. Lower and posterior wall of pit 
constituted by a narrow plate (inferior loreal) resting- along the third 
labial and terminating- on the second, Second superior labial elevated, 
forming- the anterior border of the maxillary fossa and of its superior 
anterior angle, the largest narrowing upward, and third labial consti- 
tuting the inferior wall of the orbit, of which three scales form the 
posterior wall. Upper labials eight, large and broad; the lirst and 
eighth longer than high, the others higher than long: lower labials 
eleven, tifth largest; seventh to tenth deeper than long, rostgencials 
much shorter than pregeneials, .separated by two scales. Parietals suc- 
ceeded each by a triangular plate, which is rather smaller than an inter- 
nasal. Teiui)orals 0-5, 5-4, 6-5, the inferior row much the largest. 

General color dark chestnut brown, with darker markings. Head 
above, i)uiplish black. An obsolete chestnut brown streak passes from 
the posterior end of the superciliary along the upper edge of the 
head through the middle of the second row of supralabial scales. A 
narrow yellowish-white line passes from the third labial, or begins just 
below the lowest part of the orbit, and passes backward ])arall('l with 
the first stripe on the side of the neck, where it is contiuent with the 
yellowish white of the throat. On the lower labials are three short, 
nearly vertical light bars on the fourth, sixth, and seventh: the rest of 
the Jaw Itself, as well as the interval between the stripes on the sides

front and below the eyes. General color above dull dark chestnut 
brown. On each side a series of twenty or thirty narrow vertical pur- 
plish black bars one or two scales wide. Of these sometimes two con- 
tiguous to each other on the same side are united above into an arch, 
inclosing a spuco the center of which is rather duskier than the ground 

color; at others corresponding 
bars from the opposite sides unite 
and form half-rings, encircling the 
body ; sometimes there is a lighter 
shade bordering the dark bars.

In some specimens from western 
Texas the superior labial plates 
have a slight anterior position at 
the expense of the second, which 
is somewhat narrowed, especially 
toward the labial border. In one 
specimen (Cat. No. 822) this plate 
is a triangle with the apex down- 
ward, which does not reach the 
labial border. In another it enters 
theborder by a narrower'edge than 
in typical forms. The character is 
thus variable. The same disi)lace- 
ment of the labials brings the 
fourth labial into the border of the 
orbit by a short edge in some 
specimens, but this character is also quite inconstant. On such speci- 
mens Baird and Girard proposed their To.vkophis pugnax^ but under the 
circumstances the form does not seem to be distinguishable. 

In the young of the Ancistrodon piscivorus the colors are brighter, 
more contrasted, and the pattern therefore more distinct.

Austroriparian legiou, liaving a rauge about ecjuivaleiit to that of the 
iSiren hivertina, and thus characterizing the region. It extends from 
southeast Virginia to the llio (Irande and throughout Florida. It 
ascends the Mississippi to middle Illinois and the Ohio to the Wabash 
Eiver. It inhabits swamps and the borders of water courses, and 
catches fishes with ease. It generally seeks the water on being dis- 
turbed, but will turn on the i)ursuer if cornered. Its bite is very dan- 
gerous. NMien about to strike it dis])lays the white interioi' of its 
mouth for a short time; hence the name "cotton mouth.'' In spite of

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898, 



Geueral form robust, but less so than iu the A. i^isclrorus. Rostral 
plate truncate above and uot appeariu,y on the sui)erior face of the 
muzzle, the lateral borders a little coucave. Prefrontals much larger 
than internasals. Frontal about as^ long- as wide, the lateral borders 
about as long as the superciliary borders. The superciliary plates are 
large, and extend both anterior and posterior to the frontal. Occipitals 
shorter than parietals, and longer than frontal, and longer than wide. 
Prenasal about as long as postnasal and much deeper. Loreal as deep 
as long, its superior border shorter than the inferior. Three preoculars, 
the superior the largest, longer than deep, and sometimes touching the 
postnasal above the loreal. Middle preocular narrow and bounding 
the pit above, cutting off the loreal from its border. Inferior preocular 
minute, followed anteriorly by the narrow inferior loreal which bounds 
the pit below. Superior labials generally eight, but frequently seven, 
the deficiency in number, when present, posterior to the orbit. Second 
sujterior labial twice as high as long, bounding the ijit in front and

reaching the loreal and middle preocular above. Third labial subtri- 
angular. Postocular scales three, suboculars two, all small. Tempo- 
rals 5-6, all smooth; those of the inferior row a little smaller than the 
labials, the row succeeding upward a little smaller, the rest quite small. 
Scales of the occiput and nape small, the former smooth, the latter 
weakly keeled. Inferior labials ten, fourth largest; those following 
longer than deep. Geneials very short, the posterior shorter and sepa- 
rated by scales. 

Tlie body scales are in twenty-three rows and all are keeled, but the 
first row very indistinctly, the development of the keels increasing 
upward. Those of the first row are rounded, and they become more 
angulate in successive rows to the median line; but they are not nar- 
rowed at the latter region. 

Above light hazel brown, rather brighter on the top of the head, and 
everywhere minutely mottled with very fine dai k points. On each side 
is a series of 15-26 darker chestnut-colored blotches resting on the

abdominal S(;atella', and suddenly contracting about the middle of the 
side, so as somewhat to resemble an inverted Y. These blotches extend 
to the vertebral line, where they may be truncated or end in a rounded 
ai)ex. Generally those of opposite sides alternate with each other, but 
fre(iuently they are conlluent above, formiug continuous bands. They 
are so disposed that the intervals between the successive blotches are 
pretty much of the same shape and size, though inverted. The centers 
of th(^ blotches are lighter; in some cases so nuich so as greatly to 
increase the Y-shaped resemblance. Color beneath dull yellowish, with 
a series of distinct large dark blotches, 35-45 in number, on each side. 
Chin and throat unspotted. Sides of head cream color; the line of 
demarcation very distinct; this passes along the upper edge of the 
head, in front of the eye, and involving the lower three fourths of the 
orbit, intersects the middle of the second postorbital plate (counting 
from above), and extends along the first row^ above the labials to the 
posterior edge of the last labial; the line then comes back through the 
middle of the lower labial range, where it is marked by a narrow black 
line. Ivostral of the same color. A small areolated dark si)ot near the 
inner edge of each occipital plate.

In eleven si^ecimens six have the superior labials 8-vS; two have 
them 7-8; and three have them 7-7. The reduction to seven may be 
regarded as abnormal, since in that case there is generally irregularity. 
It arises sometimes from the fusion of the seventh and eighth i)lates, 
and sometimes from the exclusion of the sixth or seventh from the 
labial border by contraction below. In the latter case the plate be- 
comes subtriangular and resembles a temporal. The nu)dification is of 
the same character as that which sometimes affects the second superior 
labial in the ^4. i)iscirorous. 

The "copperhead" is distributed from IMassachusetts to the Rio 
Grande, throughout the entire eastern and austroriparian regions, fol-

is said to jirefer meadows and low-lying ground, aud is hence frequently- 
met with by the dwellers in such situations. It is a dangerous snake, 
and (;auses serious injury and frequently death by its bite. Its num- 
bers are, however, much reduced. It finds concealment in the rocky 
parts of the country, and still remains in the trap ridges of the Con- 
necticut Valley in Massachusetts and Connecticut. This snake has- 
like many others, the habit of rapid vibration of the end of the tail 
when alarmed, and the horny spinous apex buzzing among dry leaves 
resembles no little the warning noise of the rattle of the Crotalus. 
Harmless snakes fear it, but some of them devour it. Professor Ver- 
rill, of Yale University, informs me that a black snake [Bascanium 
constrictor)^ brought to him from near New Haven, Connecticut, 
vomited a well-grown copperhead.

CTIOTJ^H.IN JR. 

Only two genera of this subfamily are known. 

Head with nine uoimal shields Sistrurus Garnian. 

Head scalfd above Crofalus Linna-ns. 

In Sistrurus tlie hemipenis is finely ilounced as is Ancistrodon 
adding this point of resemblance to the i)()Ssession of similar head- 
shields. In Crotalus the organ is strongly calyculate, the lower rows 
becoming flounces in C. basiliscus and G. conjluentus, but not in C. hor- 
ridfis, G. (litris.sus, nor G. molossm. My statement that the spines 
are not ossified in the G. durissu.s, is due to the fact that I examined a 
specimen not fully grown, although it was not a very small one.' 

This subfamily is characteristically Nearctic. There is but one species 
[Grolalns terrificuH) which is characteristically Neotropical, and there 
are two other Ootali (C. luguhris and G. basil iseus) which may range 
into the Neotropical. A Sistrurus {8. ravus) may overlap in the same 
way. The greater number of species belong to the Sonoran region. 

The geographical distribution of the Crotalinie is exhibited as fol- 
lows — the genus Ancistrodon is added in illustration:

Tail with a rattle at extremity. Head with nine symmetrical plates 
above, Nostril between two plates. Urosteges undivided. Scales 
carinated. 

This genus, as is immediately perceived, differs from Crotalus only 
in the possession of the nine cephalic scuta common to most harmless 
snakes, the Proteroglypha, and tlie genera Trujonocephalns and 
Ancistrodon in Crotalidte. The species do not reach so large a size 
as those of Crotalus, and they are hence less dangerous. Their range 
is also more restricted, since no species is known from South America 
or Mexico south of Vera Cruz. 

Three well-defined species are known, which differ as follows: 
Rostral plate wider than high, recnrved above; canthns rostralis ohscnre; loreal 
separating nasal and preocular; head not banded; dorsal spots few, longer than 

wide ; rather medinm -S'. ravus. ' 

Rostral plate higher than wide, not recurved above; canthns rostralis sharp; loreal 
separating nasal and preocular; rattle minute; head banded; light stripe com- 
mencing at eye ; dorsal spots, many *S'. tniliarius. 

Rostral plate higher than w^ide, not recurved above; canthus rostralis sharp; nasal 
and preocular in contact; rattle larger; head ])auded; light stripe beginning at 
nasal plate; two light strijies below fossa; dorsal spots, many S. catenatus. 

These tliree species occupy three distinct regions. The S. ravus 
belongs to the Tier r a Oaliente of eastern Mexico; the S. miliarius to 
the Austroriparian region of North America, and the 8. catenatus to the 
eastern region, except that part of it that lies east of the Alleghany 

' Caudisona rava Cope, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1865, p. 191. The types came from 
the State of Vera Cruz and belong to the National Museum. A larger specimen in 
my private collection came from either the State of Vera Cruz or Puebla (Proc. 
Amer. Phil. Soc, XXII, 1885, p. 382). The frontal plate is narrowed behind, and tiie 
parietals are about the size of the superciliarie.s. Rows of scales, 21 ; superior 
labials, 12; gastrosteges, 144; urosteges, 28. There are but twenty-six spots on the 
middle line of the body ; they are parallelogrannnic, or longer than wide. A single 
rounded spot is opposite each of them on the sides; no alternates. Belly clouded 
on the end of the gastrosteges. Head uniform light brown, with only a brown spot 
on each side the nape. 

Measurements. — Length, ,567 mm.; tail, 45; rattle, 12 mm., with seven joints and a 
button. In the tyi)es there are twenty- three rows of scales.

This species has some marked characteristics as compared with other 
species of the genus. The body is robust at the middle as compared 
witli its extremities: it tapers especially i)Osteriorly, so that the tail is 
unusually slender. Tlie rattle is proportionally reduced in size, and is 
smaller than that of other species of the same dimensions. Its form 
is acuminate and the segments are so small as to have suggested to 
Linnauis the name of the species. The body is at its middle parts com- 
pressed toward the middle line, or obtusely roof-shaped. The neck is 
narrow and compressed, and the head oval in outline. 

Tlie canthus rostralis is sharply defined, more so on account of a 
shallow groove within it on the superior face of the muzzle. The ros- 
tral plate is perpendicular, and is not recurved on the muzzle. Its lat- 



1142 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

eral borders are concave but vertical in adaptation to the prenasal plate ; 
below it is slightly expanded; above it slightly truncates the other- 
wise triangular internasals. The prefrontals have an open angle at the 
junction of the superciliary and frontal scuta. The frontal is but little 
wider than each superciliary and presents an open angle forward. 
Posteriorly it has a parabolic and not an angular outline, and its aj)ex 
is on a line with the posterior angles of the superciliaries, with which 
it incloses a deep notch. Each parietal is about the size of the frontal ; 
it is short and is broadly rounded behind. 

Both nasal scuta are higher than long, the postnasal the narrowest. 
One loreal higher than long, entirely separating the postnasal and pre- 
oculars. One or two small scales below it and in front of the one which 
borders the pit. Two preoculars, the inferior sometimes divided into 
a short posterior and a longer anterior. Superior labials, ten or gener- 
ally eleven, separated from the front of the orbit by one scale, from the 
rest of it by two scales. Temporals, except lowest two rows, keeled. 
Three pairs of geneials separated by a groove; the anterior pair largest, 
Gular scales smooth. Dorsal scales in twenty-one, sometimes twenty- 
three, longitudinal rows, all carinated, the first and second rows slightly. 
On the terminal fifth of the tail the urosteges are in two rows. The 
rattle is a miniature of that of other rattlesnakes, and has a gradual 
acumination of form. The gastrosteges are fewer in number than in 
other species, ranging as low as one hundred and twenty-three. 

Ground color grayish ash of various depths, punctuated with dark 
brown. A series of from thirty-eight to forty-five subcircular dorsal 
blotches extending from head to tail, dark brown, each with a narrow 
distinct yellowish border. Interval rather narrower than the spots 
themselves. A broad band of purplish red passes from head to tail 
through the blotches. On each side may be distinguished three series 
of blotches, the first on the first and second lateral rows of scales and 
j)artly on the abdominal scutelhu. The second, alternating with this, on 
the second, third, fourth, and fifth rows of scales, and opposite the 
dorsal series. The third, alternating with the second and the dorsal 
series, on the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth rows of scales. The 
latter series is dusky and obsolete; the others are uniform and dis- 
tinctly black. 

The shape of the blotches is subjected to some variation, according 
to individuals. Generally subcircular or slightly oblong, they become 
sometimes a transversely elongated quadrangle, three times as long as 
wide. Their shape varies, according to the region of the body on which 
they are found. On the anterior third they are subquadrangular, an- 
teriorly and posteriorly emarginated; on the middle region they elon- 
gate, and toward the posterior third become nearly circular. Back- 
ward of the anus the five or six blotches of that region extend on the 
sides, without, however, meeting on the lower surface. The blotches 
of the first lateral row are subquadrangular and a little smaller 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 1143 

than those of the second and third rows; the blotches of the second 
row being- transversely oblong and largest on the middle region of the 
bodj^ Side of the head purplish brown. A narrow distinct white 
line. A deej) chestnut-brown vitta, is observed, of the same length, but 
broader, and lined above with a narrow, dull yellowish margin. Two 
nndulated dark-brown vitta> extend from the vertex to the first dorsal 
blotch and confluent with it. A doable crescentic blotch is observed 
on the frontal scutellu',, leaving a transversal fulvous band across the 
head between the orbits. The color underneath is reddish yellow, 
marmorated with brownish-black blotches and minute dots.

The distribution of this species is throughout the Austroriparian region 
of the Nearctic fauna. The distance to which it ascends the Mississippi 
is as j'Ct unknown. A color variety occurs in Sonora, according to 
the record of the U. S. IS^ational Museum (Cat. !No. C067), which is 
distinguished by the small size of its dorsal spots. They are two scales 
long and three wide anteriorly, and one long and seven wide poste- 
riorly, becoming thus transverse. They are widely separated.

not extend beyond the anus, occupying the second, third, and fourth 
rows of scales. The first and lower series affect the first and second 
rows, and only one scale. The belly is of a light straw color dotted 
and sprinkled irregularly with brown.

The characters of the squamation of this subspecies have been 
already described under the head of the species. It is distinguished 
by the erect narrow rostral plate, which is truncate above, by the well- 
defined cauthus rostralis, and especially by the trapezoidal loreal, 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 1147 

wlii(;li permits the contact of the ])()Stnasjil and tbe superior i)rc()cular. 
There are two small scales between it and tbe labials, and no scales 
between the circumfossal scale and the hibials. One row below orbit 
in front, and two rows behind the fifth superior labial. Parietals 
broadly rounded, rather larger than superciliaries. The frontal is 
narrower than the superciliaries, and does not extend so far posteriorly. 
Its posterior portion contracts rather abruptly to the median angle. 
Four or five rows of temporal scales, which are smooth. Scales of body 
in twenty-five rows, of which the first is smooth and the second 
nearly so. 

The ground color above is brown; the blotches are deep chestnut- 
brown blackish externally, and with a yellowish white margin. The 
dorsal blotches are twenty-four in number from the head to the region 
opposite the anus, most of which are transversely and irregularly 
oblong, anteriorly and posteriorly emarginated, less so, however, pos- 
teriorly; eight are subcircular. Five or six exist on the tail from the 
anus to its tip, extending on the sides, the last two forming sometimes 
a complete ring. The next series on either side is composed of small 
blotches, but as intensely colored as in the other series. They alternate 
with the dorsal ones. They have no regularity either in outline or posi- 
tion. The second lateral row is composed of the largest lateral blotches. 
They are transversely oblong or oval on the second, third, fourth, fifth, 
and sixth rows of scales, and opposite the blotches of the dorsal series; 
conse(iuently alternating with the third series above. The first lateral 
series again is composed of blotches intermediate in size between those 
of the third and second series; they occupy the first anfl second rows of 
scales, and extend somewhat to the abdominal scutelhe, and alternat- 
ing with the adjoining series. Two undulated vittai extend from the 
supraorbital plates along the neck to the first dorsal blotch, and often 
confluent with the latter. A linear vitta margined with yellowish 
white extends from the posterior edge of the eye to the sides of the 
neck; the inferior yellow margin is the broadest, and passes from the pit 
close to the angle of the mouth, turning forward to the middle of the 
lower jaw, inclosing a seraielliptical brown patch. Two elongated 
yellowish spots may be observed diverging from both sides of the pit 
to the lip. The cephalic plates are deep chestnut brown; a transverse 
light-brown band extends across the head from one orbit to the other. 

The color underneath is blackish brown, intermingled with yellowish.

Measurements. — The entire snake measures 777 mm. in lens'tli, of 
which the rattle is 39 mm. (Cat. No. 12752), from Lucknow, Ontario. 

As the largest sj)ecies of the genus, the Slsfrurus catenatus is the 
most dangerous. According to Prof. O. P. Hay,' this species is abun- 
dant in some parts of Indiana, but he does not confirm its occurrence 
south of Indianapolis. In this connection he remarks : 

U. C. Ridgley reports it from AVabash CoTinty. I have seen specimens from 
Lajjorte, Hendricks, Hamilton, and Montgomery counties. They appear to be 
abundant iu the swampy grounds iu the neighborhood of Lake Maxinkuckee, in 
Marshall County. The black specimens are frequently found in Indiana. They 
were once described as a distinct s[>ecies, l»ut their dark coloration is probably 
nothing more than an individual variation. We have a very similar case in the 
differently colored forms of J leicrodon pJalyrhinus, Colnher obsolctus, and Xutri.r sipcdon. 

This species is, on an average, considerably smaller than the banded rattlesnake, 
Crotalus liorridns. It is, on that account, less to be feared than that serpent, since 
the fangs would naturally penetrate less deeply, and the amount of poison that is 
injected into the wound would be less. Indeed, Dr. Kirtland, of Ohio, is quoted as 
saying that its bite is scarcely worse than the sting of a hornet. But having had a 
good deal of experience with and knowledge of these snakes, I think they are not 
to be tampered with. Animals that have been bitten by them, such as dogs and 
cows, suffer much and have troublesome swellings. Tlie rattle is less powerful 
than that of its larger relative, but may 1)6 heard at a sufficient distance. The 
snalies appear to prefer low, wet grounds as their habitation, but they are not 
aquatic. Yet they may often be found far away from water, in dry fields. On the 
prairies of Illinois, before the country became thickly populated, tliese reptiles Avere 
extremely abundant, and the; killing of two or three dozen of them in a season was 
not an unusual thing for any farmer's boy. Now, in that same region not one is seen 
in years. This disappearance of these snakes has been supposed to be due to the 
destruction wrought among them by hogs. Vet on those prairies in those days 
there were no roaming hogs. The extinction of the snakes maybe due to the break- 
ing up of the soil, the draining of the ponds, and the clearing away of the rank 
vegetation, which furnishes them protection. At tlic present day it is only in 
swamjis and marshes that they are found. 

It appears that these snakes shed their skins at least twice a year; and since, fur- 
ther, Garman has shown that the segments of the rattle represent a retained por- 
tion of the sloughed epidermal covering, it seems quite probable that two or more 
joints of the rattle are produced each year. In any case, the ago can not be deter- 
mined by the number of segments, since the terminal ones .are continually being 
worn off and lost. 

The young of this species .are brought into the world alive. Tliey are .about six 
in number at each brood, and when born are about six inches long. They appc^ar 
about the 1st of September. This species has been included by Goode in his list of 
those Avhose females allow the young a place of safety in the stomach. Tiie writer 
has published .an account of the observations made on two females of this snake by 
a man of credibility, who had captured them and kept tliem until they had iiro- 
duced young." According to these observations, the young passed freely into and 
out of the mother's mouth until they were a month old. After this time the motlier 
was very attentive to the young, as I saw myself.

The above simple diagnosis embraces the characters which distin- 
guish the genus Crotalus. This type, the most specialized form of the 
order Ophidia, is chiefly distributed in North America, to which, if we 
regard the Mexican plateau as a part of it, twelve of the (ifteen si)ecies 
are restricted. Two species are found in South America, but none 
occur in the West Indies. Within tbe nearctic region the distribu- 
tion of species is very unequal. Thus but one species, the C. horridus, 
is contined to the eastern district. A second, the C. (KhuHaittrn.s, exists 
in the austroriparian district, but extends itself from this region 
westward across and throughout the Sonoran district as far as the 
Pacific Ocean, occupying also the Lower Californiai district. This dis- 
tribution is only imitated by the Zamenis JhKjclhon among North 
American reptiles. The Central and Pacific districts are occupied by 
another species, C. confuentus, which also extends over the northern 
part of the Sonoran. To the Sonoran district we must go for five 
species: C molossus, C. tigris, C cerastes, C. lepidiis, and C. pyrrhus, 



1150 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

wliicli are all of rather small dimensions, excej^t the first named. Two 
others are confined to the Lower California peninsula, G. mitchellii and 
C. enyo, while two are restricted to the Mexican plateau and its western 
slope, the C. imlystictus and C. hasiliscus. 

The variations in structure of these species is not great, and they 
form a compact generic division. Dr. Coues has proposed to separate 
the C. cerastes as type of a separate genus, distinguished by the pro- 
longation of the free border of the superciliary plate into a horn-like 
process. Were this process distinctly articulated at the base from the 
superciliary plate, as is the case in the viperine genus Cerastes, we 
should be compelled to adopt such a division ; but at present I do not 
see the way to separate it, especially as the process is often but little 
l)ronounced. I have also proposed a generic division for the G. Jepidns 
based on the single nasal plate, but the plate is sometimes divided in 
part, and for the present I do not adopt the division, or at least until 
I can see more specimens of the species. 

The origin of the curious epidermal structure at the end of tlie tail, 
known as the rattle, is as yet a subject of speculation only. We have, 
however, so many rudiments of it in other generic divisions oi the Cro- 
talidic that its origin from some of these is evident, and that it occurred 
at no very late period of geologic time is probable. The terminal cau- 
dal vertebra^ are coossified, compressed, and expanded into a vertical 
body, which enters the first or basal button of the rattle. Such a mod- 
ification is found in a rudimental condition in the genus Lachesis, where 
it is covered by a simi)le horny sheath, grooved at the sides. In 
Sistrurns the rattle is of absolutely and relatively small size, and here 
we can see the beginnings of the segmentation and inflation of the 
joints, which constitute the x^erfected structure. The manner of for- 
mation of these segments has not been studied as yet, but the general 
theory of the origin of the entire structure is probably the same in 
this case as in others in the animal kingdom. The violent vibrations 
into which most snakes throw their tails when excited has determined 
nutritive processes to its extremity and produced the excessive growth. 

The species of this genus are of rather sluggish movements, and are 
not quick to bite unless trodden on. They throw the body into a coil 
and sound the rattle, giving a sigmoid flexure to the anterior part of 
the body, on which the head is poised with open mouth ready for 
action. At this time droits of the poisonous saliva fall from the fangs, 
and by a violent expulsion of air from the lungs are thrown at their 
enemy. In the act of biting the movement is threefold. First, tlicre 
is the spring of the body, which never exceeds two-thirds of its lengtli ; 
second, the bite proi)er, caused by the seizing by the jaws; and, third, 
the clutch with the fangs themselves, which are moved freely back- 
ward and forward by the flexor and extensor muscles of the maxillary 
bone on tlie prefrontal as a fixed point. This grasping movement may 
be observed in Crotali when very much excited and anxious to bite, 



CROCODILIAN^, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 1151 

and may be performed by the snake's liead when severed from the 
body. I had a narrow escape from being bitten in this way by the 
head of a Crotalus molosHus, which was attached to the body by skin 
only. 

Eattlesnakes live in all kinds of ground, but naturally persist longest 
in rocky regions, where they have abundant i)laces of concealment. 
Some of the si)ecies grow to a very large size, particularly the C. ada- 
mantoii.s of North and the C. (lurissus of South America. The former 
is probably the larger of the two; at least we have information of 
larger specimens. I am credibly informed that specimens have been 
found on the islands off the Gulf coast of Florida of 8 feet in length. 
Some specimens of the western subspecies G. a. atrox also reach a large 
size. The third species in dimensions is the C. horridns, which grows 
on the coast of North Carolina to a length of 5 feet and proportionate 
thickness. The species of the plains, C. confluentus, rarely reaches so 
large a size. Its gray-greenish color readily (!onceals it in the sparse 
vegetation and it is only observed when closely approached. It is very 
abundant north of the Missouri River and extends north to the Sas- 
katchewan, beyond the line of distribution of any other species. 

From the effective character of their weapons of offense and defense, 
rattlesnakes have a great advantage in the struggle for existence 
against all animals except man and his domestic companion, the jug. 
Hence in unsettled localities in North America they are abundant, 
especially in the warm regions of the South and West. In many 
places they are the most abundant species of snake, as, for instance, 
on the plains, where no s])ecies is as often seen as the Crotalus conjlu- 
entus. That they have been much more abundant in many wild parts 
of the East than at present, is indicated by the great quantities of their 
bones which are found in the caves of the limestone regions of the 
Mississippi Valley. The pig, as is well known, will destroy and eat rat- 
tlesnakes with impunity. It is said that the poison is not sufficiently 
introduced into the circulation to cause death, owing to the thick adi- 
l)ose layer with which the domesticated pig is covered. 

The following synopsis of the characiters of the species of Crotalus is 
the result of long familiarity Avith them. Some of the forms originally 
regarded as species are treated as subspecies, owing to the evanescence 
of their characters. In spite of the subdivision of their head plates, 
the homologues of the plates of harndess snakes maybe traced. Thus, 
there are from two to three preoculars and from one to four loreals. 
The nasals are never more than two, and the nostril is always between 
tliem. There is one ])air of geneials. The species of Section I display 
homologues of internasal and prefrontal plates, while the same, more 
divided, are seen species of Section II. 

The transitional forms or subspecies in this genus, as is usually the 
case, furnish instructive evidence as to the evolution of the chaiacter 
of the species. It is not imiirobable, as already remarked, that their

Crotali generally, scales rounded at the posterior apex, carinated but 
slightly. 

(ieneral color above that of roll sulphur, beneath pale yellowish, pos- 
teriorly very faintly clouded with brownish. Tail black. Anteriorly 
the scutelhe are entirely immaculate. Along the back is a series of 
transverse reddish or chestnut-brown lozenges embraced iu a width of 
twelve or fourteen scales and four or five scales long, and with the 
exterior angles produced to the abdomen. These lozenges are frames 
with the outline generally one scale in width and with the centers of 
the ground color; sometimes divided by a median line of brown, so as 
to show two yellowish spots inside of the lozenges. The scales exterior 
to the lozenges are rather lighter. Sometimes the brown rings and the 
lozenges widen at the abdomen and indicate lateral spots of four scales; 
at others, and especially anteriorly, the rings are obsolete, and the 
browu is iu a dorsal series. Iu fact, for the anterior foui'th of the body 
we have a dorsal patch of brown, showing alternately at successive 
intervals one large yellowish spot and then a pair of smaller ones, 
owing to the confluence of the successive lozenges. The superciliaries 
and scales anterior to them, as well as a broad patch below and behind 
the eye, light greenish brown. Tail uniform dark brown above, paler 
beneath. Only one button with two necks, no rattle. 

A remarkable character of this species is that each individual scale 
is ol' a uniform tint to its base, and does not show two colors, as in 
other species.

anterior to its angle, or canthus. 

This species presents greater variations than any other known, and 
its subspecies have been regarded as species. I find transition from 
one to the other of these forms, however, and they forbid recognition of 
uiore than one species. This form ranges from the Atlantic to the 
Pacific in the warmer parts of North America, and descends to Chi- 
huahua and Cai)e St. Lucas to the southward in Mexico. This is the 
largest and most formidable species of the genus, examples eight feet 
in length having been reported to me from the Gulf coast of Florida 
by Admiral McCauley, U. S. Is. 

The subspecies differ as follows : 

Entire top of head covered with irregular ilat scuta larger than the usual scales; 
hody colors paler than tail bauds ; dorsal rhombs with truncated angles one ; loreal 
plate C. a. scuhdatns 

Top of head with large plates on canthus rostralis, but scales elsewhere; two 
loreal plates; dorsal rhombs complete, not paler than caudal bands; last caudal 
band a broad ring C. a. adamantens. 

Top of head with plates on canthus and scales between; generally one loreal plate; 
dorsal rhombs paler than bauds of tail, which is not black at end C. a. atrox.

scales between the suborbitals and labials. Light stripe from angle of 
eye to canthus rostralis above the labials, and another from before 
the eye to the labials, as in G. a. atrox, but the rostral and space in 
front of the pit and nostril not lighter than the crown. On the middle 
third of the body a dorsal series of distinct rhomboids, margined with 
whitish and with the lateral angles acute, much as in C. a. atrox or C. a.

quite uidike those of G. Incifer. The ground color is light yellowish or 
brownish ash; on the middle third of the body there is a dorsal series 
of rhomboidal blotches more or less truncated before and behind; ante- 
riorly they become elongated longitudinally, and not only truncated, 
but sometimes emarginateon the longitudinal angles, while the lateral 
angles are rounded, leaving the blotches subcircular. Posteriorly the 
dorsal blotches continue to have the lateral angles acute and perfect 
till they become confluent with a lateral series, and form nineteen half 
rings, six of wiiich are on the tail. In the middle third of the body the 
dorsal blotches are inclnded in eleven or twelve dorsal rows and are 
four to four and a half scales in longitudinal extent; anteriorly they 
become longer longitudinally, and only nine to ten scales in transverse 
diameter. The dorsal blotches are light brown, bordered for the width 
of one scale with darker. They are separated along the backs by a 
line of the ground color one and a half to two scales in width, and imnie- 



lino REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

diately bordered by a narrow line lighter than the ground color, as in C. 
confiuentus, C. a. atrox, and C. a. adamanteus, this line being about a hali 
scale in width. Posteriorly the light intervals between the rings widen 
to three or three and a half scales, while the rings themselves become 
much narrower, being only two to three scales wide. On the middle 
third of the body below, and oi)i)osite to the dorsal series, is another 
row of small rhomboidal or sometimes triangular brown blotches on 
each side. They involve four to six scales and extend from the second 
to the fifth lateral row of scales, and are bordered by light lines like 
the dorsal series, from which the^^ are separated by a single scale. 
Indications are seen of another series of small blotches resting directly 
upon the abdominal scutella*, alternating with and a little lower than 
the first lateral series. The abdomen is whitish yellow without dis- 
tinct blotches. A light line from posterior angle of superciliary and 
orbit to angle of jaw above labials, and another from before the eye to 
labials. The markings of the head of this species seem to be very 
nearly the same as in C. lucifer. There is, however, indications of a 
light border to the external edge of the suj)erciliary, and the rostral 
and entire space in front of the nostril and i)it, as well as a little pos- 
terior to these, is as dark as the crown, while in G. lucifer they are dis- 
tinctly lighter. 

Though this subspecies so closely resembles G. adamanteus atro.v, itAvill 
be readily distinguished by the large plates of the head and by the dor- 
sal rhombs being more imperfect in their outlines anteriorly and poste- 
riorly. The type specimen (Oat. No. 5021), and another (Oat. No. .S(5(>9), 
might be properly referred to Section I of the genus with the C. moJos- 
sus, since the anterior head scuta are quite identical with those of that 
group, but Oat. Nos. 14225 and 14278 show division of tliese plates. 
The tendency to form parietal scuta is peculiar to this subspecies. Like 
the G. molossus, its habitat is on either side of the United States and 
Mexican boundary, where it is not uncommon. I have not seen speci- 
mens from south of the city of Ohihuahua. Dr. Boulenger' records it 
from Huamautla.

Head wide posteriorly ; muzzleobtuse, not especially elevated. Nasal 
plates distinct from each other and separated from the two elongate 
preoculars bj^ two loreals, of which the superior is the smaller, being 
sometimes quite small. Two rather small internasal plates which are 
connected with the superciliaries by two large plates of the canthus 
rostralis, the posterior one of these being quite large. Seven or eight 
rows of smooth scales between inner edges of superciliaries. Three 
rows of .scales between orbits and superior labials. The latter number 
fifteen, the inferior eighteen. The scales of the cheek are smooth. 
Scales in twenty-seven or twenty-nine rows, the two inferior rows 
smooth, the third and fourth obsoletely, the rest strongly keeled. 

Scales on the back and sides not conspicuously different in size except 
the lower two or three rows. Posteriorly, near the tail, all the scales 
are carinated; except the lowest. 

General color, yellowish gray, with rhomboidal black blotches, lighter 
in the center, and with all the angles perfect. Or rather there is a 
series of dull yellowish lines crossing oblicjuely from one side of the 
abdomen to the other over the back, following the oblique series of 
scales, and occupying generally the posterior half of each scale, the 
basal portion being black. These lines, of which there are about 
thirty-six crossing from each side, from head to tail (nine on tail), 
decussate first on the tifth or sixth lateral row, and then on the back, 
where they are more or less confluent three or four rows. The rhom- 
boids thus enclosed and crossing the back are generally black for one 
and one half or two scales within the yellowish lines, and the most 
central portion is dark yellowish brown, mottled with darker. The 
intervals on the sides between the lines are mostly dark yellowish 
brown, minutely mottled with dark brown. These intervals constitute 
a lateral series of transverse rhomboids, sometimes with the lower 
angle truncated. Opposite to the dorsal rhomboids is a series of small 
triangles in the angles of the first decussation. The distance between

two parallel transverse stripes generally consists of five rows oF scales, 
occasionally of six. 

On the sides and posteriorly these markings are more or less indis 
tinot, though generally recognizable. The tail nsually exhibits a good 
deal of black. The under parts are dull yellowish white, or greenish 




white, clouded toward the sides with brown. No regular spots visible. 
The black on the tail does not constitute complete rings, but is inter- 
rupted in the middle of the lower surface, and in fact the black patches 
alternate with each other, and are not opposite. The last patch, how- 
ever, forms a complete ring wider than the rest, so that the end of the 
tail is black. This is peculiar to the subspecies G. a. adamanteus. 



CROCODILIANS, LTZAWDS, AND SNAKES. 1163 

The top of tlie head is light brown, with occasional lihujk scales, A 
dull yellowish streak starts at the posterior edge of the superciliary 
plate, and passing obliquely backward, through two rows of scales, 
extends to the angle of the mouth. A second band starts on the plate 
in advance of the superciliary, and crossing the anterior orbitals, 
expands till it involves the seventh, eighth, and ninth upper labials. 
Interval l)etween the first two stripes dark brown. There are also 
indications of a second vertical light bar in front of the nostril, and 
two below the ]>it. Kostral dark yellowish, lighten- in the margin.

The largest specimeu now in the U. S. National Museum is 6 feet in 
length, or 2.025 mm.; the tail measures 235 mm., of whi(;h the rat- 
tle is 70 mm. The latter, though broken, has twelve joints and a but- 
ton. The rhombs on the posterior part of the body are very obscure, 
and the tail bands are not so black as in younger specimens. Professor 
Holbrook mentions specimens of 8 feet in length and Admiral E. Y. 
McOauley, U. S. N., assures me that he has seen specimens of that size 
on the island off Pensacola, Florida. This is, then, the most bulky of 
the venomous snakes. The Najid Ophiophagus hnmjarus exceeds it in 
length, but is a slender snake.

1164 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

Dr. Eiuar La^'unberg^ writes of this species as follows: 

In the interior of Florida the dianioud-backed rattlesnal\e is scarce, hut not so 
along the coast and on some of the Florida keys. In the neighborhood of Ozoua, in 
Hillsboro CoTinty, I heard of the killing of nine rattlesnakes within two weeks in 
October, 1893. It evidently prefers the neighborhood of the water, and is a good 
swimmer, not afraid to cross over from ''key" to "key." If not too often disturbed 
this species is slow and does not rattle nnless offended. I saw one in the hitter part 
of October in the ])inc woods near Toronto, Orange Connty, coiled np under a pal- 
metto bush. A dog following ns went up and sniffed at him, with his nose hardly 
a foot from the snake. We called the dog back, and a man ran forward with a whip 
and struck the snake sevei'al times. After the second blow the snake began to rattle 
and make himself ready to strike. This shows plainly the slow nature of the snake. 
In other cases they are more easily offended. Those kept in boxes and cages often 
begin to rattle as soon as they see anyone approaching. They are easy to keep alive, 
and take food without trouble. I saw one that was kept in a small box and was fed 
with toads; it did so well there that it changed its skin twice in a summer. They 
are often kept in the shops of taxidermists and in " curiosity stores," where northern 
tourists buy them, paying good prices. The skin is often used for ornaments or for 
the manufacture of pocketbooks and similar objects. 

People are very seldom bitten by rattlesnakes in Florida. The rattling, the strong 
odor, and the slowness of the snake are protective. The snake is often caught by 
placing an empty barrel over the coils, after which a board is shoved under the snake 
and the whole thing turned over.

Plates Oil bead ; two internasals in contact; between tbese and super- 
ciliaries, on side of tbe crown, two imbricated plates. Space inclosed 
occupied by smaller scales. Superciliaries bordered by a row of larger 
scales ; the anterior much largest. Three rows of scales between labials 
and suborbitals. Labials sixteen above; first, fifth, and seventh larg- 
est; fifteen below, first and third largest; one loreal plate, which rep- 
resents the inferior loreal of the C. a. adamanteus, except in specimens 
from lower California, where the superior loreal is present. Scales in 
25 — '21 rows, the exterior smooth. 

General style of coloration somewhat as in G. adamanteus. Ground- 
color above dull yellowish brown, with a series of subhexagonal patches 
from the head nearly to the tail, in an uninterrupted series, separated 
throughout by narrow lines. We may refer the markings to the inter- 
section of light yellowish lines, about forty in number, crossing obliquely 
from each side across to the other, along the anterior half of as many 
oblique series of scales. The lateral decussation is along the sixth row

of dorsal scales; on the back, where they cross, the lines are confluent 
for a breadth of Ave or six scales, making a series of transverse lines 
across the back, truncating the obtuse angles of the rhomboids, which 
would otherwise be produced. Sometimes the acute lateral angle of 
the rhomboids are also truncated. Laterally, the yellowish lines are 
more or less obsolete, leaving a more or less distinct chain pattern. 
Tiie ihomboids or subrhomboids inclosed have a narrow margin of dark 
brown, lighter toward the center. In all cases the interval between 
the successive rhomboids is but one or two half scales in width. The 
lateral rhomboids and triangles referred to in G. a. adamanteus are indi- 
cated by two alternating series of dark brown blotches, the tirst along 
the third and fourth lateral row, oj)posite the apices of the rhomboids; 
the second along the sixth and seventh, and alternating with the

same; the spots occupy one scale, or part of four contiguous ones. Space 
between these rhomboids and the yellowish lines is dull yeHowish brown. 
Beneath nearly uniform yellowish, slightly clouded on the sides of the 
scales. On the tail the blotches are confluent into three or six dark 
brown lialf rings, interrupted on the under surface. (Jeneral distribu 
tion of lines on the head nnich as in C a. adamanteus; a narrow light line 
from the posterior end of the superciliary backward, directly to the 
angle of the mouth; a second from the anterior extremity, nearly par- 
allel with the tirst, the two inch)singan indistinct patch, and separated 
on the labials by four and one-half scales. There is also a single narrow 
light line across the superciliary obsolete in old specimens. 



1166 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

It may readily be distiuguished from G. a. adamanUus by its ligbt color 
and the truucatious of the rhomboids, as well as the general obsolete- 
ness of the lateral markings. The rhomboids are longer in proportion 
and more rounded. The two lateral rows of scales are smooth, the 
next two more strongly carinated than in C. a. adamanteus. The iifth 
upper labial is largest, and transverse; the rest nearly uniform. The 
stripes on the head are less distinct. The last black band on the tail 
is not so wide, and does not embrace it so as to form a black termina- 
tion of that organ. The subspecies atrojc has in general the paler 
characters which western representatives of eastern species so often 
present, excepting iu regard to the black bands of the tail, which are 
quite as deep iu color as in the eastern adamanteus. 

As com^jared with the Crotalus confluentus^ which this subspecies 
resembles at first sight, these color characters always distinguish it. 
These are in the latter: First, the passage of the dark postocular band 
above the angle of the mouth ; second, the absence of black rings on 
,the tail, and third, the nonrhombic form of the dorsal spots.

Four specimens from near Gape St. Lucas, Lower California (Oat. No. 
12045), all have two loreals as in the subspecies adamanteus. In all 
other respects these specimens are like the true atro.v, except that in 
one the posterior canthal plate is smaller than usual, but not so small 
as in the subspecies ruber. A specimen (Cat. No. 4G7) from the Great 
Basin has the bleached appearance of the form C. conjiuentus leco7itei, 
which inhabits the same region. 

This form has the manners of the typical subspecies. I observed a 
pair of fully grown ones on the headwaters of the Colorado lliver in 
Borden County, Texas. They were rather sluggish. One I caught in 
a noose and suspended it on a stick until dead. The other one retreated 
among the rocks as fast as pursued, and was allowed to escape.

rank of a species. All the characters ascribed to it turn out to be con- 
staut, excepting" that probably the red color is in some specimens 
replaced by chestnut brown. Its affinities are with the C. adamanteun 
atrojc, but its general appearance is more like that of the C. confiuentus 
lucifer. The cutting off" of the labial part of the first inferior labial 
plate is present in all the specimens of the G. ruber. This is frequently 





met with in C. a. atrox, but does not occur in any other species. The 
direction of the postocular band and the coloration of the tail is also as 
in C. a. atrox. On the o"ther hand, the reversed i ehition of size between 
the internasal and posterior canthal (or lateral prefrontal) is not found 
in the C. a. atrox nor in any of the forms of the C. adamanteus or 
C. conjiuentusy and its lateral decurvature is only approached by some

specimens of the C. c. lucifer. It is in the dorsal coloration that the 
C. ruber resembles the G. c. lucifer, but the broad, ill-delined postociilar 
band not passinj*' beyond the canthns of the mouth and the white tail 
with black rings easily di^stinguish it from the common form of the 
Pacific coast. 

This is a large species; besides Cat. No. 0201) above measured. Cat. 
No. 20381 measures 1,400 mm. and Cat. No. 192G!); 1,130 mm. 

Dr. iStejueger remarks' that tlie characters by which I originally 
defined this form --do not seem to hold in a larger series." I find on 
examining the same material that the characters are fully substantiated. 

The habitat of tlie C. ruber ia southern California as far north as San 
Francisco. Mr. Van Deuburgli reports a head from Ensenada, in the 
adjacent part of Lower California, but as he remarks that the only 
peculiarity it presents is that of color the identification may be for the 
present regarded as doubtful. 

In young specimens the color markings are better defined. This is 
the case with Cat. No. 8850, where the dorsal spots are rhombic on the 
posterior three-quarters of the body, and are parallelogrammic on the 
anterior fourth, and the pale lateral borders are very faintly indicated. 
Details as follows : 

Cat. No. 8856 ; rows of scales, 29 ; upper labials, 15 ; gastrosteges, 194 ; uroateges, 21 ; 
total length, 600 mm. ; length of tail, 52 mm. ; rattle, 22 mm.

scales in twenty-three to twenty-seven rows, all keeled except the 
external three on each side. 

Color light brown, with one row of dark brown spots usually paler 
edged, on the median line of the back, which are generally longer than 
wide anteriorly, but soon become transversely oval, and ultimately 
assume the form of cross-bands. Tail of the same color as the body, 
with cross-bands of the color of the dorsal spots. Belly unspotted, 
but with dark shades in some forms. 

Four well-defined subspecies are embraced in this species; they are 
defined as follows: 

Cephalic scales larger; 4 rows between superciliary plates, 4 rows below orbit; dor- 
sal spots and cephalic bands light edged; few posterior cross bands .conjinentus 

Cei)halic scales intermediate; 6 rows between superciliaries; 3 rows below orbit 
(probably sometimes 4) ; dorsal spots square, with the head bands, not light edged ; 
posterior cross bands more numerous ; color dotted with brown specks . .pulverulentus 

Cephalic scales smallest; 8 rows between superciliaries; 4 rows below orbit; dorsal 
si^ots with light centers and l)rown borders light-edged or not ; head bands obsolete ; 
numerous posterior cross bands leconlel 

Head scales small as in C. c. leconiei ; colors dark ; dorsal spots and bands not pale, 
centered and closer together than in C. c. leconiei; head wide, rounded lucifer 

The distribution of these subspecies is as follows : The typical one 
inhabits the plains including western Texas and southern California, 
also C. c. leconiei belongs to the Great Basin. The C. c. pulverulentus 
is a form of the Sonoran district; while the C. c. lucifer inhabits the 
Pacific district to its eastern limit, the northern Kocky Mountains.

third. Stripe from superciliary to angle of jaws, crosses angle of the 
mouth on the second row above labial. Kostral margined with lighter.

consists of six, not four as in (J. atro.v. Siipeiciliaries more prominent. 
Labial series mucli smaller. Upper anterior orbitals much smaller, as 
also is the anterior nasal. Scales on the top of the head less carinated.

number instead of four. Two lateral rows of scales smooth, first, 
second, and third jiradually increasing in size. Scales more linear than

along the back light brown, darker than the margins of the blotches. 
Anteriorly the interval between the dark spots is but a single scale; 
posteriorly it is more, becoming sometimes two scales, where also the 
spots are more rhomboidal or lozenge-shaped ; nearer the tail, however, 
they become transversely quadrate. The fundamental tlieory of colora- 
tion might be likened to that of Crotahis <((lani<(ntci(s, namely, of forty 
or fifty light lines decussating each other from opposite sides; but the 
angles of decussation, instead of being acute, are obtnse, and truncated 
or rounded off throughont. Along the third, fourth, and liftli lateral 
rows of scales is a series of indistinct brown blotches covering a space 
of about four scales and falling op])osite to the dorsal blotches; between 
these blotches, and opposite to the intervals of the dorsal blotches, are 



1172 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

others less distinct. Along the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth rows 
is a second series of obsolete blotches, each covering a space of about 
four scales, and just opposite the intervals between the dorsal spots. 
The dorsal and lower series are separated by an interval of three scales, 
this interval light brown. Beneath, the color is dull yellowish, and ten 
or twelve darker half rings are visible on the tail. 

In point of coloration the principal features, as compared with C. a. 
atrox^lie in the dorsal blotches, being disposed in subquadrate spots 
instead of subrhomboids; the intervals thus forming bands across the 
back perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. This tendency to assume 
the subqnadrangular pattern has broken up the chain-work into 
isolated portions, as in Osceola doliata trlangula, or Sistrtirxs terge- 
minus. Tbe intervals of the dorsal blotches are wide and darker in the 
middle, while in G. a. atrox they are narrow, not linear, and unicolor. 
The sides of the head present the usual light stripe from the posterior 
extremity of the superciliary; it i)asses, however, to. the angle of the 
jaw on the neck, along the second row of scales above the labials. A 
sscond stripe passes in front of the eye to the labials, widening there. 
A small light vertical bar is seen below the pit, and another on the 
outer edge of the rostral. On the superciliaries are seen two light 
transverse lines inclosing a space nearly one-third of the whole surface. 
In C. a. atrox there is a single median line. Sometimes, as in C. a. atrox, 
the single blotches on the n&jje are replaced by two elongated ones 
parallel to each other.

This rattlesnake is a universal companion of tlie prairie marmot, 
Cynomys ludovicianns. I have observed them together from near the 
Oanatlian border in Montana to the southern extremity of the staked 
plains in central western Texas. Not only do the marmots provide 
them food, but their burrows furnish them a safe refuge. In some 
regions the wild rat Neotonia does the same service. 1 well remember 
a large Crotalus which dwelt in apparent harmony with a rat and her 
lamily near a camp north of Clarendon, in the Panhandle of Texas. 
Both the snake and the rat were fat, but no young rats were in sight. 

This is the familiar rattlesnake of the plains. They are frequently 
found near the camp of the traveler, and, like others of their genus, 
intlict no injury unless provoked or hurt. The bite is, however, fre- 
quently fatal if fairly delivered. When the head is raised in the act 
of attack the light strii)es of the muzzle and lips present a handsome 
appearance. 

Dr. H. A. Brous gives his experience of the relations between the 
rattlesnake, jirairie marmot, and the prairie owls in the following 
language:' 

Prairie dogs (Ciinomiis htdovicianus) seoin to have a most inteii.so dread of rattle- 
snakes {Crotaltifi conlhunius). This little animal dreads not only its venomous bite, 
but more the loss of its young, which serve as food for these snakes that enter their 
burrows, take i)os8es8ion, and drive them from their homes. Where does one iind a 
prairie-dog town but that it is teeming with snakes and the strange little owl 
{Speotyto cuiipnilaria) that "ducks" to passers in ludicrous solemnity? These do

not roustitiite a liappy family. The owls, though they generally occupy an abau- 
douecl hole or burrow, destroy the young dogs. Nor do the eggs and nestlings of 
the owls faro with any better treatment from tlie snakes; between these exists much 
enmity. One afternoon, while passing through one of these dog towns in Wallace 
County, Kansas, we heard a most unusual noise and stir (in the town), as though 
they were holding a bellicose council. They were collected around a hill, into 
which they were scraping dirt vigorously. On examining the burrow it wns found 
to contain a large rattlesnake that the dogs were trying to entomb. I noticed this 
several times, as did other members of our party. To leave no doubt upon the sub- 
ject, we dug out the snakes after shooting them.

Lake Valley, New Mexico. 

Collection of E. D. Cope. 

Cephalic scales intermediate; six rows between superciliaries ; three 
rows below orbit (probably sometimes four); dorsal spots square, with 
the headbands, not light edged; posterior cross bands more numerous; 
colors dotted with brown specks. The ground is a yellowish brown, 
and the belly is light yellow. The dorsal spots are a darker brown, 
and are composed of dense punctulations of uniform tint throughout. 
Bands on head indistinct. 

The C. c. pulverulenttis at first sight resembles the Grotalus mitchelli, 
having much the same coloration, but the head scales and plates are 
quite different. It gives out a powerful musky odor when excited, 
which I have not noticed in the typical form of the species. 

I have two specimens in my collection which I took near Lake Val- 
ley, Sierra County, New Mexico, about 60 miles north of the border of 
Mexico. I nearly stepped on one of them on a hot day, and' he vio- 
lently resented the intrusion. At a safe distance I annoyed him by 
tossing pebbles, sticks, etc., at him, and he made unsuccessful eftbrts to 
reach me. As he lay with head erect and mouth open, the poison

dripped from his fangs and, with liis violent expiration or hisses, was 
thrown toward, without leachiiig nie. My ascription of this habit to 
rattlesnalies in my Synopsis of Snakes of North America ' brought out 
in the pages of Forest and Stream some vigorous protests and asser- 
tions that I was quite in error. Among my critics was Capt. Charles 
Bendire, who lias seen a great deal of rattlesnakes in the West. How- 
ever, the circumstance occurred as 1 now state it. At the same time 
it is the only time that I have observed it. The habit is probably not 
common among rattlesnakes, but it is nevertheless usual among venom- 
ous snakes, and the genus Crotalus is not likely to be an exception.

Cat. No. 8143, U.S.N. M. 

This form is the C. confinenUis of the Great Basin. Althougli it is 
quite diflerent from the typical G. confluenUis, 1 can not distinguish it 
as a species. It is indeed more closely allied to the Californian sub- 
si)ecies C. c. lucifer, and although it is not ditticult to distinguish most 
individuals of the two, the differences rest largely on color and form of 
the head and other features of no great constancy. 

Cephalic scales smallest; eight rows between superciliaries; four 
rows below orbit; dorsal spots and headbands light-edged or not; 
numerous posterior cross-bands. The general appearance is that of a

bleacbed-looking C c. conflMentus, with a peculiarity in the dorsal 
spots. These consist of a dark brown circumference only, the centers 
difleriug little from the ground color. The bands and stripes on the 
head are wanting or obsolete, the postorbital being faintly indicated. 
Instead of these there are irregular blackish splotches more or less 
confluent on the top of the head between the orbits and behind that 
region. The tail bands are very distinct. 

Cat. No. 4617; rows of scales, 25; upper labials, 16; gastrosteges, 169; urosteges,

48 mm. 

This subspecies agrees with the G. c. lucifer in the small size of the 
scales which cover the head, but differs from it greatly in color. While 
this forms the palest of the subspecies, the C. c. lucifer is the most 
deeply colored, in agreement with the general law of Allen, namely, 
that the pale types inhabit dry regions, and the dwellers in moist 
climates are more heavily pigmented.

than the rest, but irregular. Scales on the cheeks large, flat, smooth. 
Ground color, light brown above. Along the back a series of sub- 
hexagonal or octagonal blotches, formed by a skeleton of dull yellowish, 
constituting a dorsal chain. The space thus inclosed of the ground- 
color is margined faintly with dark brown. The width of the interval 
between the sut-cessive blotches is from one-half to one and a half 
scales. These spots are frequently confluent, two and three running 
together. Where most distinct the s])ots are four scales long and 
eleven wide. On each side of this dorsal series is a second, separated 
by a single row of scales, the blotches extending from the abdominal 
scutellse to the fifth or sixth row. These are smaller than the dorsal

and subcircular. ()))posite the transverse light bands, and in the open 
space between four contiguous blotches on the sides, smaller blotches 
are indistinctly visible. Posteriorly the s])ots on the back and sides 
are confluent and darker, in one specimen forming seventeen half rings, 
encircling the back, leaving about twenty-four dorsal blotches. Abdo- 
men greenish yellow, more or less clouded with brown at the bases of 
the scales. Head dark brown; alight line from posterior ])ortion of 
the snperciliaries along the fourth row of supralabial scales back to the 
angle of the jaws, on the occiput, where it expands into the color of 
the under part. Upper labials of the same light color behind, rapidly 
widening anteriorly so as to include whole front and side of the face, 
leaving only the top of the head dark. The space about the facial pit 
darker. 



1178 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

The theory of coloration is that of decussating lines, which, when 
they intersect, unite so as to have the angles of intersection truncated. 

The species has a general resemblance to G. a. atrox in the arrange 
nieut of the blotches, but is darker, and has about seventeen dark 
half rings posteriorly instead of four or five. In G. a. atrox the head 
is narrower and more triangular, the s])ace between the superciliaries 
narrow, and occupied by augulated larger scales instead of small tuber- 
culous ones. In G. a. atrox the row bordering the superciliaries is much 
larger than the rest, and the scales on the top of the head generally more 
angulated. In C. c. Incifer the line on the side of the head, instead of 
going directly from the posterior end of the superciliary to the commis- 
sures, passes back nearly parallel to the moutli, crossing along the fourth 
row of scales above the labial. The second line in front of the eye is 
much wider below in G. c. lucifer, and the face generally shows more of 
white, while the dark portions are mu<-h darker. 

In small specimens the colors are much brighter and the pattern 
better defined. Such individuals graduate into the G. c. conjiiientus of 
corresponding age which are found in southern California. On the 
other hand, the large sjjecimens become obscure in the pattern of col- 
oration, and lose various marks; for instance, the superior border of 
the postocular band and the lateral borders of the dorsal spots. This 
form is simply the dark-colored phase of G. conjiiientus, characteristic 
of a relatively wet climate. 

As already remarked, this subspecies is directly connected with the 
typical one G. c. confluentus by the intermediate form G. c. lecontei. 
This gradation is especially evident in specimens from the mountains 
of Arizona, where the colors are apt to be dark; as for instance in speci- 
men, Cat. No. 8397.

Dr. Stejneger, in his report upon the rei)tiles of the Death Valley 
Expedition, says: 

The present species is characteristic of the interior valley and slopes of California 
as contrasted with the Great Basin, and the boundary between the two forms seems 
to be quite sharply drawn, at least in the regions visited by the expedition. There 
is probably no stronger contrast among the reptiles of the same genus met with by 
theUeath Valley explorers than that between the pale and clay-colored rattlesnakes 
in the desert plains [C. c. lecontei E. D. C] and mountains, and the dark-colored C. 
lucifcr which they obtained only in the San .Joaquin Valley and in the monntain 
slopes encircling it. 

The distribution of this subspecies is given by Dr. C. Hart Merriam 
in the same publication, as follows: 

This species does not inhabit the Great Basin, but was found in a number of locali- 
ties on the west or costal slope of the Sierra, and in the San Joaquin Valley. Speci-

a branch from which cuts off more or less completely a part of the 
margin. Five or six rows between supraorbitals. Scales on cheek 
and back of head keeled. Body scales not narrowed, all keeled, except 
the inferior three rows on each side. 

The ground color of the alcoholic specimens is a light yellowish gray 
above and a dirty white below. The median dorsal line is crossed by 
numerous trunsverse hexagons of a brown color, which is punctulated 
with a darker brown. The interspaces of two scales on the middle line 
are pigmented probably yellow in life. On the inferior four or five rows 
of scales opi)osite the lateral angles of the hexagons is a series of ver- 
tical brown bars or spots. Near the anterior fourth of the length these 
fuse with the hexagons, forming cross-biinds, which continue to the end 
of the tail. They are wide at the middle ami narrow at the sides of the

spaces. G-astrosteges with brown aud gray sliades at their extremities 
at points alternating with the dorsal and lateral spots; otherwise with- 
out markings. Tail colored like the body, buff with brown cross-bands 
except at the extremity, where there are two black cross-bauds. 

The colors of the head are indistinct. There is a brownish-gray 
postocular band which extends to the angle of the mouth, the superior 
border not well defined, the inferior one a yellowish band, which is as 
wide as the eye and reaches the labial border below it. A large spot 
on each side of the nape above the suspensoriura of the lower jaw, 
which sends forward a shade to the inner border of the superciliary 
plate on each side. Superciliary aud nasal plates paler than the 
others. 

Cat. No. 5271 differs in several respects from the types (Cat. Kos. 
471, 472). The dorsal and lateral spots do not unite into cross bauds 
anterior to the tail. The lateral spots are represented by traces only on 
the anterior third of the length. The dorsal spots have brown borders, 
while the interiors are but little darker than the ground color, and are 
not punctulate. The interspaces are not yellow. The head markings, 
except the postorbital band, are wanting.

The large number of specimens of this species obtained by the Death 
Valley exploring expedition enables me to add considerably to the 
knowledge of its characters. The division of the supraorbital plate is 
present in all of the new specimens, but in various degrees. It is indis- 
tinctly indicated in one of the types, and may have been indicated 
in the other, but have been obliterated by long soaking in weak 
spirits. This division, when comj)lete, is into three parts — an anterior 
smaller and a posterior larger, and a still smaller marginal, produced 
by the bifurcation of the transverse suture. This marginal scute is fre- 
quently only half defined. This structure is, in some of its conditions, 
probably similar to that which gave origin to the horn of the C. cerastes^ 
which is a prolongation of a fold of the supraorbital plate defined by 
two grooves. The number of loreal plates varies from one to three, 
but one is the more common number. 

This species is nearest the G. enyo Cope of the Lower Californian 
Peninsula. It differs from that species in the smoothness of the head 
scales, which are strongly carinate in G. enyo; also in the presence of 
keels on all the body scales, except sometimes one row, instead of the 
five and six smooth rows on each side. The color is materially different, 
since the G. tkiris is a pale form apparently adajtted to desert surround- 
ings, while the colors of the G. enyo, especially the head bands, are 
bright and strong. The i)attern is not very different, but the lateral 
angles of the dorsal hexagons have a black apex in the G. enyo, which 
is wanting in G. tigrin, and head bands are wanting or very indistinct. 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 1183 

The distribution of this species is commented on by Dr. Stejneger in 
his report on the reptiles of the Death Valley expedition as follows: 

The "tiger rattler," of which the expedition has l)roiight home quite a series, is oue 
of the rarest species in collections. Discovered during tlie survey of the boundary 
between the United States and Mexico, and described by Kennicott, the habitat of 
the species was given in general terms as "Deserts of Gila and Colorado," but I can 
find no evidence of specimens recorded from anywhere except from the Sierra del 
Pozo Verde,' in Arizona. A specimen was afterwards collected by Dr. Irwiu at Fort 
Buchanan, Arizona, and recorded by Dr. Yarrow in his Catalogue of the Rejttiles and 
Batrachians in the U. S. National Museum (No. .5271). Dr. .J. G. Cooper has since 
enumerated C. tujris from the California side of the "Colorado Valley," but whether 
he based his record upon specimens actually collected (in which case, probably near 
Fort Mohave), or only upon the general statement in the report of the Mexican 
Boundary Survey, I do not know. 

It does not appear to have been collected by any of the many parties of the Pacific 
Railroad Surveys, nor was it brought home by the herpetologists of the Wheeler 
expedition west of the one hundredth meridian. 

The extension of its known range by the present expedition is therefore very 
material, and is the more interesting since it was found almost over the entire desert 
area visited. So far from being restricted to the Colorado Valley proper, as sur- 
mised by Dr. Cooper, it seems to be chiefly confined to the desert mountain ranges, 
in which it ascends to a considerable altitude, as shown by the table below, while 
horizontally its range has been extended over quite a considerable area of southern 
Nevada. 

A study of the present series convinces me that the nearest affinity of the " tiger 
rattler" is with the true Crotaliis conjluentus of the plains, in spite of the rather 
striking and, in many respects, peculiar aspect of the former. 

Dr. Merriam gives the following note in his report on the results of 
the Death Valley expedition : 

The known range of this exceedingly rare rattlesnake has been greatly extended 
by the expedition, specimens having been secured at frequent intervals from Owens 
Valley, in California, to the Great Bend of the Colorado, on the boundary between 
Nevada and Arizona. It was usually found in rocky places in the desert ran<'es — 
rarely in the intervening valleys. 

When i)assing through Emigrant Canyon, in the Panamint Mountains, in California, 
April 15, two large rattlesnakes of this species were killed at one shot by Mr. 
Stephens, at an altitude of 1,400 meters (1,600 feet). They were on a ledge of rock, 
and were standing erect with their heads near together, apparently playing. In Indian 
Spring Valley, north of the Charleston Mountains, in Nevada, one was found in a 
wood rat's nest that was dug open to secure a large scaly lizard {Scelojwrus magister) 
which had taken refuge there. Its stomach contained a kangaroo rat {Dqiodomi/s) 
and a pocket mouse ( Per of/nat hits), indicating nocturnal habits. Others were killed 
in the upper part of Vegas Valley (near Cottonwood Springs) and Vegas Wash, 
Nevada, and in Owens Valley (on Independence Creek), Coso Valley, the Argus Range 
Slate Range, Pauamint Range,»and (Grapevine Mountains, California. In the Argus 
Range nineteen were killed in or near Shepherd Canyon, during the latter part of 
April and first week of May, by Dr. Fisher's party. 

'The name is written both Sierra del Pozo Verde and Sierra Verde in the Rept. 
U. S. and Mex. Bound. Snrv. (See I, Pt. 1, p. 121, and Pt. 2, p. 70). This range 
is situated on the boundary between Arizona and Sonora, nearly due south of Babo- 
quivari Peak, and about 50 miles northwest of Nogales. A spring known as Agua 
del Pozo Verd«! (Green Well) is situated at the foot of the western slopo near the 
southern end of the range.

CROTALUS PRICEI Van Denburgh. 

Crotalus pricei Van Denburgh, Proc. Cal. Acad. Sci., 1895, p. 856. 
I copy the following description from Van Denburgh, as I have not seen 
the species: 

Small; internasal and prefrontal plates large; anterior nasal in contact with ros- 
tral; supraocular normal; nine supralabials; 153-159 gastrosteges ; two rows of 
small dorsal spots; belly dark slate. 

Head subtriangular; rostral nearly as broad as high; two nasal, one loreal, and 
two preocnlar plates; two internasals; four prefrontals; one to three rows of scales 
between supraoculars; nine supralabials; nine infralabials, first pair in contact on 
the median line; one row of scales between labials and orbit; scales in twenty-one 
rows, parts of the lower two smooth ; gastrosteges one hundred and fifty-three to 
one hundred and fifty nine; urosteges twenty-one to twenty-seven, the first and 
from two to nine of the posterior ones usually divided; rattle very slender and 
delicate. 

The general ground color is olive gray so thickly covered with minute brown <lot8 
as to give the animal a decidedly brownish hue. A narrow dark brown band of 
uniform width runs back and down from the eye just touching the upper angles of 
the eighth and ninth labials without involving them. The scales below this band 
are vinaceous cream. There are two small seal brown spots on the occiput. The 
geneials and gulars are yellow tinged with vinaceous laterally. The rest of the 
head is unicolor. Along each side of the back is a series of from fifty-four to sixty 
small brown blotches. Anteriorly these have a tendency to alternate, but posteriorly 
they unite with one another to form crossbars. There are seven similar brown bars 
oil the tail. The dorsal blotches are seal brown, palest centrally, and are edged 
with very pale brown or white. They are about one and one-half scales long, and 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 1185 

from two to three rows of scales wide. Tbey are sepurated from the other blotches 
on the same side of the back by about one and cue-half scales, and from those of the 
opposite side by the width of one scale. There are two or three rows of smaller 
alternating brown spots on the sides. The gastrosteges, except anteriorly, are dark 
slate. The edges of the gastrosteges and of the scales of the first row are whitish. 
The tip of the tail is bright salmon or tiosh color.

This interesting- species has relationships with both the C. tigris and 
the C. lepidus, }n(lgi\\g from the description. It seems to be quite dis-

and size of the dorsal spots. The urosteges are more than usually 
divided.

Crotalus horridus Linn.eos. 

= 1. 

Kansas. 

Cat. No. 4621, U.S.N. M. 

Upon the top of the extremity of tbe muzzle tbere are two subtri- 
augular shields (iDternasals) in contact with eacb. other. A large oval 
shield covers the region over each eye (superciliary). These shields 
are in contact anteriorly with the j)refronta], and forms upon each side 
the external shield of a cross series (postfrontals) immediately behind 
the prefrontals, which is usually composed of five plates. The remaining 
part of the upper surface of tbe head is covered with small subtuber- 
culous scales. 

The shields bounding the upper lip (superior labials) are from twelve 
to fourteen in number, the fourth or fifth the largest; those bounding 
the lower lip (inferior labials) thirteen to fifteen. Three rows of scales 
separate the eye from the superior labials. Two plates iu front of the 
eye (preoculars), the lower usually reaching the pit in the side of the 
face; the upper larger and separated from the hinder of the two plates, 
between which the nostril is pierced (nasals) by two or more small 
plates (loreals). The scales of the body are in twenty-three or twenty-

five longitudinal rows, all keeled, the two rows on each side next the 
shields of the abdomen (gastrosteges) faintly. 

The ground color above varies from bright yellowish tawny or ful- 
vous to dark brown; beneath from whitish yellow to black gray. A 
light line extends from the superciliary plate to the angle of the mouth, 
behind which is a dark band or blotch. Upon each side of the medial 
dorsal line there are two series of brown or black spots. The spots of 
the upper or medial series are larger, rhomboid, running obliquely 
upward and backward. They are frequently confluent across the 
middle line of the back anteriorly; always upon the posterior half of 
the body. The spots of the lower series encroach slightly ui)on the 
gastrosteges, and posteriorly unite with those of the middle series to 
form zigzag cross bands. Anteriorly they sometimes alternate with 
the central series, or rather become confluent with an indefinite alter- 
nating series, and joining the extremities of the former inclose the 
ground color, which thus forms a series of light spots. Of these trans- 
verse bands or rows of spots there are twenty one, more or less, from 
the head to the anus. In Southwestern specimens a narrow rufous 
band frequently extends along the median dorsal line throughout the 
whole length. Tail nearly always entirely black. 

This species is found from Maine to Kansas and from Louisiana to 
Florida.

The largest individual of this species which I have seen is from near

that of the full sleeve of an ordinary house coat. 

This species has the widest range of all the species excepting the 
tropical C durissus. It was formerly abundant in the eastern district 
everywhere, but it has been exterminated from the well-settled regions 
and is only abundant in the wilder regions. It is not uncommon about 
Lake George in northern New York and in the Berkshire Hills in western 
Massachusetts. Thence it is to be found throughout the Alleghany 
Mountains to Georgia and Alabama, 1 have not seen a specimen from 
Florida.

Prof. O. P. Hay ^ gives the following account of the habits of (Jrotalus 
Iwrridus: 

In its free state this species appears to inhabit wooded districts, although it may 
probably sometimes be found on the prairies. It especially delights in taking up its 
abode where there are rocks and dobris, amoug wliicli it can find at short notice a 
safe retreat. Its movements of locomotion are rather slow. When surprised, it will 
often seek to escape without intlictiug injury on its enemy. When, however, it is 
pressed, or there is no time for retreat, it delivers a blow with such rapidity that the 
motion can hardly be followed. 

Rattlesnakes do not appear to try to injure one another by biting. Indeed, Dr. 
Mitchell states that the poi.son does not aifect the snakes themselves. He says that 
he has over and over injected under the skin of a rattlesnake its own venom or that 
of a moccasin, or of another rattlesnake, but he had in no ca.se seen a death. He 
often kept from ten to thirty-five rattlesnakes together withovit any of them harm- 
ing the others. If a large snake were suddenly dropped on the others they would 
show no resentment, whereas if any other animal were thus dropped on them it 
would immediately get a blow. In captivity they are extremely sluggish, not mov- 
ing, and for long periods refusing to accept food. Usually, after about a year with- 
out food, they will kill and eat animals. Dr. Mitchell fed his nnmerous specimens 
by putting a long funnel down their throats and pushing the food into their stomachs. 
They were very fond of water, and would drink large (jnantities of it and lie in it 
for hours. 

They shed their skins at different times. If they did not have water, the skin 
would come off in patches. He says nothing about the relation of the shedding of 
the skin and the accjiiisition of new segments of the rattle. It has been noted by 
observers that a variable number of segments of the rattle is acquired each year, 
although tlie popular idea is that one is the number. As high as four have been 
observed to be added in a single year. The terminal segments, too, are constantly

beiiitf worn off, bo that the imiiih«r of seniiieiits present is no indication jf the »<^e 
of the snake. 

Holbrook stat'es that Mr. I'eah-, of tlie Phiiailolphia Musenni, kept a living female 
rattlesnake for lourteen years. She had eleven rattles when she cauao into his pos- 
session. Several were lost annually and new ones formed. When slu' died, there were 
still eleven. During this period the snake had grown 4 inches in length. 

The number of young appears to be al)out nine. I found this number of eggs in a 
female about .37 inches long, brought from Pennsylvania. The eggs were 1..5 inciies 
long by an inch in diameter. Of these there were four in the left oviduct. There 
were evidences that development had begun. 

Where these snakes are numerous, they are inclined to gather in considerable num- 
bers in caverns in rocks and similar places in order to undergo their winter sleep. 
Such places form the rattlesnake dens about which wo hear occasionally.

General color above light grayish brown, shaded with yellow; vertex 
rugous, marked with a pair of small brown spots. A light band bor- 
dered with dark crosses each superciliary plate; from the inner border 
of the same plate begins a chestnut brown band, which diverges 
from its fellow on the posterior part of the head, where it is either 
interrupted or continuous Avith a broader one which nearly joins that 
of the opposite side on the neck; here they are either interrupted, or 
continuing, unite on the neck, and form the first spot. A brown baud 
extends from the eye to the cauthus oris, involving the last labial i)late, 
and is continued beyond, forming a spot on each side the throat. A 
series of about thirty-three spots are longer than broad, emarginate 
anteriorly and posteriorly; opposite to each is a black spot upon scales 
of the first, second, and third rows. The dorsal spots become broader, 
resembling transverse rhombs, with light borders outside the black; 
the lateral angles become confluent with the lateral black spots, forming 
vertical black bands on the sides. They finally assume the form of 
transverse brown bands. The tail is crossed by five of these, upon a 
brown ground. Beneath yellow; tips of many of the gastrosteges 
blackish. Inhabits Lower California, whence specimens have been seut 
to the Philadelphia Academy and Smithsonian Institution by Mr. John 
Xautus. Type 46G3. Xautus collection. 

This species bears considerable resemblance to G. inolossus in its 
style of coloration, and, like it, is a beautiful animal. The latter species 
is scutellated upon the muzzle, as in C. durisstis, the rows of scales are 
more numerous than in C enyo, and it is without the head stripes.

Fig. 344. 
Crota!,us lepidds Kennicott. 
= 1. 
Rio Grande, Texas. 

Head ovoid, tapering to the nose, wliicli is narrow, pointed, and 
depressed. Nostril small, circular, and placed near the point of the nose 
in about the middle of a nasal plate, which is nsually only divided from 
the nostril downward. Two elongated internasals in contact, extending 
behind the nostrils. Superciliaries and other large plates smooth. 
Rostral subtriaugular, broader than high, the apex turned back slightly 
upon the crown. Upper preorbital small and separated from the post- 
nasal by the width of two larger loreal jilates. Labials rather large, 
twelve above, ten to twelve below. Color of head yellowish ash. 

The head is nuich depressed, the general outline ovoid, tai)ering 
regularly from about opposite the angle of the mouth to the nose. The 
crown is remarkably smooth and the occipital scales are very faintly 
carinated. There are two large internasals elongated laterally and 
iwsteriorly, with their inner ends in contact. They are convex on their 
external and concave on their internal edges, and extend for nearly 
half their length back of the nostril. Behind and litting into the 
emarginatiou formed by these are two subciuadrangular and sujaller 
plates in contact. Immediately behind these is another similar pair. 
On each side of these last two pairs, at the edge of the crown, between 
the superciliaries and anterior frontals, is a larger plate. The super- 
ciliaries are rather small, and, like the other larger plates, quite smooth; 
the space between the superciliaries is quite narrow and filled with 
three rows of irregular large scales; the i)osterior part of the crown is 
also covered with rather large and smooth scales. The lower preorbital 



1192 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

is, as usual, small and elougated over the pit, but the upper, very small 
and quadrangular, is separated from the nasal by two plates, each 
larger than itself. In all the other species the upper preorbital is large, 
more or less elongated, and in contact with the postnasal or only 
separated from it by the width of one smaller plate. The suborbital 
chain is complete, and there is only a single row of scales between that 
and the labials. The color of the head is uniform yellowish or light 
brownish ash without any distinct spots or stripes, though each x)late 
is minutely mottled with brownish and with a few scattering black 
dots, and there is a very faint indication of the usual posterior facial 
stripe extending over the angle of the mouth. 

It will be at once distinguished from C. tigris by the single nasal, 
number of loreals, number and comparative size of labials, and number 
of rows between the suborbitals and labials, and by the narrow, pointed 
nose instead of the broad, blunt snout of C. tigris. It disagrees also 
with C. c. lucifer in all of the above characters excepting the size of 
labials and the narrow nose, and differs widely from that species in the 
depressed snout, wide rostral, and perfectly smooth plates and scales 
on the head. By the smoothness and size of the plates and absence of 
the horn it will be at once distinguished from C. cerastes. It will be 
impossible to confound it with any of the Eastern siiecies. 

The color above is a greenish gray, which is crossed by nineteen jet- 
black rings on the body, which do not extend on the abdomen. These 
rings are two and a half scales wide on the middle line and narrow 
downward on each side, so as to cover but one scale in width. The 
scales which border the annul! are half black and half green, the effect 
of which is to give the edge of the ring a turreted outline. The edges 
of the ground color are paler than any other part of the scales, thus 
throwing the black into greater relief. A large black spot, shaped like 
two hearts side by side, with the apices i)osterior, marks the nape, and 
there is an irregular small black spot on each side of the occiput 5 some 
black specks between the orbits; no other marks on the head. Near 
the middle of the gray spaces of the body some of the scales of many 
of the rows have black tips. The tail is light brown above and has a 
basal broad black and two other narrow brown annuli. Below dirty 
white, with closely placed shades of brown. 

The following specimon is in the lunseum of tbo University of Kansas, and is from 
the Magdaleua Mountains, New Mexico. It furnishes the following data: Rows of 
scales, 23; upper labials, 12; gastrosteges, 153 ; urosteges, 27; total length, 555 mm. ; 
rattle, 74 mm. 

In the typical specimens the nasal plates are not divided. In three 
specimens since received the plates are separated from the nostril 
downward. In two si)ecimens the cross-bands are uninterrupted. On 
^wo others (from Fort Huachuca, Arizona) the bands are broken at 
the ends on the sides, along the middle of the length, giving rise to a 
row of lateral spots. In both the tail is salmon color, with two dark 
cross bands.

This is a i)ecnliarly handsome species and is the only one to which 
the term "green rattlesnake*' can be correctly applied. In the airange- 
ment of its dark colors it ai)proii(;hes nearer to the C. horridus of the 
East than any other form. In the arrangement of its head scales it 
approaches the C. polystictus.

In this species the subdivision of the h -.id scales is carried further 
than in any other. The rostral is separated from the nasal by one or 
two series of scales, and there are from two to five loreals, the posterior 
two representing the anterior parts of the preoculars of other species. 
There is no distinct can thus rostralis, and the scales of its external 
border are identical iu character with those that separate them on the 
median part of the muzzle and front. All of these scales are rather 
small and are striate. Six to eight rows separate the superciliaries. 
The latter have a strongly convex external border. The muzzle is 
short and wide, and the nostrils are somewhat vertical in position. 
Three rows of scales separate the orbit from the labials. Superior and 
inferior labials both fifteen, the first inferior divided transversely, so 
that the postsymi)liyseal part is a separate element. The symphyseals 
taken together corditbrm; rostral a triangle, a little wider than high. 
Tlie scales of the body are in twenty three to twenty-five rows and are 
rather obtuse. They differ little in size, except that the median five or 
six rows are narrower. All are rather weakly keeled except the two 
exterior. They are in addition finely striate ridged toward the base. 
The rattle of the type specimen displays eight Joints and a button. 

The color above and below is grayish yellow. The upper surface of 
the head is shaded, that of the body coarsely and densely punctnlated

lations form a series of about forty-two dorsal spots. These are trans- 
verse, with produced lateral angles, extending across twelve rows of 
scales from angle to augle, separated from the adjacent ones by a bright 
band of ground color one and a half scales wide. On the posterior 
fourth of the total length they form brown cross bands. Five upon the 
tail are black on very light ground, as in (J. a. atrox. Anteriorly there 
is an ill-delined series of spots, which are opposite those of the dorsal 
line. A yellow band extends from the nasal plates anterior to the eye, 
involving from the ninth to the last superior labial. Superior to this 
is a brown band extending from the eye and ceasing on a line with the 
augle of the mouth. Some indistinct brown marks on the top of the 
head are arranged as follows: One on the inner border of each super- 
ciliary; three [losterior to these, the median short and broad; four 
further posterior, the median pair longer, diverging, reaching the neck.

The typical specimen from which this si^ecies was described was 
taken at Cape St. Lucas. A specimen from Arizona which subse- 
quently came to hand differed so widely in squamation and color that 
I referred it to a distinct species under the name of C. pijrrhus. Thus, 
while the Cape St. Lucas specimen had two loreals, the Arizona ani- 
mal had four, and while the Cape St. Lucas snake was pale gray, with 
scarcely discernible dorsal spots, the Arizonian was red, with dark-red 
quadrate dorsal spots. Dr. Stejneger subsequently observed that speci- 
mens from California, in about the latitude of the Arizonian locality, 
had the color of the Cape St. Lucas specimen, and that the number of 
loreals was not constant. Still later Mr. Van Denburgh, of the Cali- 
fornia Academy of Sciences, has shown that the number of loreal

very variable, so that the distinction between the two supposed species 
is purely individual.

only separated from prenasal below the nostril, and from preocular by 
a large loreal. Three rows of scales below orbit. Scales on top of 
muzzle smooth, four on each side larger than the others, two bordering 
the nasals above, ai)d two smaller ones bordering the superciliary in 
front. Scales between superciliaries small, in five rows. Those behind 
them and on the cheek keeled. External border of the superciliary 
plate produced, sometimes (;onsiderably to an obtuse apex, which is 
grooved longitudinally below. Scales of the body strongly keeled, 
except the two inferior rows, which are smooth. 

General color light yellowish or brownish gray above, dirty white 
below. The upper surface is crossed by a median series of transverse 
brown hexagons, the color marked with numerous black punctulations. 
Opposite the lateral apices of these, on the fourth row of scales, is a 
small spot of the same color, and between these, on the first and sec- 
ond rows, and the end of the adjacent gastrostege is a rather larger

dusky spot. None of these spots have dark or light borders except the 
median series, which are narrowly black edged anteriorly and poste- 
riorly on the middle part. The dorsal bands increase in relative trans- 
verse diameter on the posterior part of the body, but it is only on the tail, 
and a part of the body of equal length anterior to it that they extend, 
that they are united with the lateral spots. The extremities of the gas- 
trosteges are shaded oi)posite the lateral and median spots, but tlu-y 
are elsewhere unspotted. The head is in the specimens in alcohol with- 
out markings on the pale ground color, excepting a dusky postorbital 
band, which passes above the rictus of the mouth. The space anterior 
to it, and below the eye, as far as the maxillary fossa, is very light 
colored, probably yellow in life. The superior border of the postorbital 
band is not defined; the inferior border is marked with some small 
black spots.

1198 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

We have but few specimens of this species, five only having come 
under my observation. It is ne?:est the G. tigris Kennicott, but has 
even fewer scales on the body, presenting the smallest number known 
in the genus. The labial plates are fewer, and the gastrosteges mate- 
rially less numerous (28). The partial fusion of the nasal plates is also 
characteristic of the G. cerastes as of the G. lepidus. 

A small rattlesnake has been long known to the Arizonians as the 
"sidewinder," from its habit of progressing sidewise instead of in 
the usual way. It has been ascertained by Dr. J. L. Wortman that the 
species which possesses this peculiarity is the Grotalus cerastes. Dur- 
ing an ethnological exploration of the valley of the Salt River, a tribu- 
tary of the Gila, in Arizona, he frequently observed the snake and its 
habits. 

In his report on the results of the Death Valley expedition Dr. Mer- 
riam gives the distribution and habits of this species as follows : 

The horned rattlesuake, or "sidewinder," as it is locally known throughout the 
region it inhabits, is the characteristic snake of the Lower Sonoran deserts of the 
Great Basin, from southern California easterly across southern Nevada to Arizona 
and southwestern Utah. It inhabits the open deserts, while its congener of the 
same region {C. tigris) lives in the desert ranges. Its local name is derived from its 
peculiar mode of progression. When disturbed it moves away sideways, keeping 
its broadside toward the observer instead of proceeding in the usual serpentine 
manner. Its bite is said to be fatal, which is probably not the case under ordinary 
circumstances. A large number were secured by the expedition, and many others 
were killed, but no one was bitten by it. It was found on both sides of Pilot Knob, in 
the Mohave Desert (April 5 and 6) ; in Pahrump Valley, where four were caught in a 
space of a mile and a half (April 28 and 29) ; in Vegas Valley (May 1) ; in Vegas Wash 
(May 3); in Indian Spring Valley (May 29), where one was shot containing a kan- 
garoo rat (Dijmdomys) and two pocket mice {Pero(inailius); in the Amargosa Desert 
(May 31), and in Sarcobatus Flat (June 2). It was common in the valley of the 
Virgin and Lower Muddy (May 6 and 7), and was said to inhabit Pahranagat 
Valley, though we did not find it there. 

During the latter part of April and the early part of May these rattlesnakes were 
often found in pairs, and were doubtless mating. At such times they remained out 
in plain sight over night instead of retreating to holes or shelter under desert brush, 
and on two occasions they were found by us on cold mornings so early that they 
were too chilled to move until considerably disturbed. I stepped on one of these by 
accident as it lay in a compact coil with its head in the center, but it was held so 
firmly by my weight that it was unable to strike. A moment before, I had killed its 
mate. I killed three on the mesa east of St. Joe, in the valley of the Muddy, in 
eastern Nevada, May 7.

GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION. 

As is well known, the aggregates of organic beings called faunie and 
fior.e correspond in part with the natural land divisions of the earth's 
surface, but not exactly. The first classification of the primary faunie 
was proposed by Dr. P. L. Sclater in 1858, as follows : 

1. Paleaictic. — Europe, Northern Africa, Northern and Central Asia. 

2. Ethiopian. — Africa south of the Great Desert, and Madagascar. 

3. Indian. — Southeastern Asia and the Malay Archipelago. 

4. Australian. — Australia with New Guinea and the adjacent islands, New Zealand, 
and Polynesia. 

5. Nearclic. — North America as far south as Mexico. 

6. Neotropical. — Central and South America and the West Indies. 

Subsequently Dr. A. R. Wallace proposed that the name Oriental be 
used in place of Indian. 

In 1868 Prof. T. H. Huxley proposed that the world's areas be arranged 
in two divisions, Arctogani and Notoga'a; the former including the 
Palearctic, Indian, Ethiopian, and Nearctic of Sclater, and the latter 



1200 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

including the Australian and Neotropical regions. To the last two he 
added the ^STovo-Zealanian for New Zealand, and he proposed to change 
the name of the Neotropical to Austrocolumbian. 

In 1871 Dr. J. A. Allen proposed the following faunal divisions: 
I. Arctic Realm ; II. North Temperate Kealm ; III. American Tropical 
Realm; IV. Indo- African Tropical Realm; V. South American Tem- 
perate Realm; VI. African Temperate Realm ; VII. Antarctic Realm ; 
VIII. Australian Realm. 

In 1874 Sclater modified his system as follows: He retained the term 
Arctogsea in the Huxleyan sense. To the Neotropical region he gave 
the name of Dendrogiea, and to the Australian he gave the name of 
Antarctogtea, omitting New Zealand and Polynesia, which he consti- 
tuted a fourth division, Ornithogica. 

In 1878 Heilprin proposed the name Holarctic to include Sclater's 
Palearctic and Nearctic regions. He also proposed two transitional 
regions; that of the Old World he called Mediterranean and that of 
the New World the Sonoran, the latter a term already introduced by 
Cope for a division of the Nearctic of Sclater. 

In 1884 Gill proposed the following primary divisions or realms: 
1, Anglogitan (North American); 2, Euryga^an, or Eurasian; 3, Indo 
goean; 4, Afroga^an; 5, DendrogcTan, or Tropical American; 6, Amphi- 
gican, or Temperate South American; 7, Austrogiean, or Australian; 
8, Ornithoga^an, or New Zealand; 9, Nesogtean, or Polynesian. Pro- 
fessor Gill justly insisted on the importance of fresh- water fishes as 
furnishing definitions of natural faunal realms and regions. 

In 1890 Blanford published a system of geographic zoology in which 
he adopted the primary divisions of Huxley, and divided the Arcto- 
gsean region into the following : Malagasy, Ethiopian, Oriental, Aqui- 
lonian (= Palearctic and northern part of Nearctic), and Medio- 
Columbian (southern part of Nearctic). 

In 1896 Lydekker proposed the following divisions: I. Notogjeic 
Realm; regions: 1, Australian; 2, Polynesian; 3, Hawaiian; 4, Austro- 
malayan. II. Neog^ic Realm; region, Neotropical. III. Arctoga^ic 
Realm; regions: 1, Malagasy; 2, Ethiopian; 3, Oriental; 4, Holarctic; 
5, Sonoran. Lydekker makes use of paleontologic evidence in this 
connection. While this treatment of the subject is important from the 
point of view of origin, it is often irrelevant, since the distribution of 
vertebrate life in each geologic age was different from that in each 
other geologic age. 

In an essay on the geographical distribution of North American 
Reptilia published in 1875, the present writer adopted the first system 
of Sclater. After a lapse of twenty years, the light thrown on the sub 
ject by various investigators suggests the following modifications: In 
the first place the recognition of the close similarity of the life of the 
northern regions of the earth, requires more definite formulation than 
was accorded it in Sclater's first system, by the union of his three divi- 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 1201 

sioiis of Nearctic, Pahvaictic, and Indian into one, for which the name 
Arctogiiea is a])propriate. The incloisaie of his Ethiopian division in 
it, as proposed by Hnxley, does not seem to me to be i)roper, in view 
of the important types of fishes and reptiles which characterize it; for 
instance, the Crossoi)terygian, Dipnoan, and Scyphophoroiis fishes, and 
the Pleurodire tortoises. In the tishes, indeed, tlie Etlnoi»ian region has 
as mnch affinity with the Neotropical fauna as with any other, in its 
Characinid and (^ichlid fiimilies, and in the Dipnoan subclass. The pres- 
ence of the Dipnoi and the IMeurodire tortoises allies it to the Australian 
fauna as well. It is for these reasons that Professor Gill proposes to 
combine the southern hemisphere realms into a single "Eoga'an" 
division. The northern athnities of the Ethiopian Kealm are, however, 
too many to permit us to regard this arrangement as a just expression 
of the facts. Thus, it has Insectivorous Mammalia, Firmisteruial 
Anura, and Cyprinid fishes, none of which are Australian or Neotro- 
pical types. The course that remains under the circumstances is to 
regard the Ethiopian Kealm as fully distinct from the other three. 
The definitions of the four primary divisions are then as follows: 

The AustraUan Bcalm is peculiar in the absence of nearly all types of 
Mammalia, except the Orniihodelphia and the marsupials; in the i)res- 
ence of various Ratite birds, in great development of the Proteroglyx)h 
serpents, and absence of the higher division of both snakes and frogs 
(thitt is, Solenoglypha and Pirmisternia); in the existence of Dipnoi 
{Ccratodus) and certain Isospondylous families of fishes. On the other 
hand, many of the lizards and birds are of the higher types that prevail 
in India and Africa, namely, the Agamida' and the Oscines. 

The Neotropical Realm only possesses exclusively the Platyrhine 
monkeys and the great majority of the humming birds. It shares 
with the other southern regions the Edentate and Tapiroid mammals: 
Ilatite, Pullastriue, and Clamatorial birds; Proteroglyph snakes; Igua- 
uid Sauria, the Agamids being entirely absent; Arcilerous frogs; and 
Characinid, Chromid, Osteoglossid, and Dipnoan fishes. It has but few 
types of the northern regions; these are a few bears, deer, and oscine 
birds. Insectivorous Mammalia, Viperid ser[)ents, and Ginglymodous, 
Ilalecomorphous, and Cyprinid fishes are wanting, except on the north- 
ern border. 

The Ethioinan Realm is that one which combines the prevalent features 
of the Arctogiiean Realm with the southern hemisphere types already 
mentioned, together with some found elsewhere only in the Indian region, 
and a very few peculiar. The two latter classes not being mentioned 
elsewhere, they may be here enumerated. This region shares, with the 
Indian alone, the Catarrhine monkeys, theElephautidu', Rhinocerotidic, 
Nomarthrous Edentata, and Chameleons. Its peculiar tyi)es are the 
Lemuridas llippopotamidu', and Protelida-, Cryptoproctida'. and llyra- 
coidea among mammals, and Polypterida' and Mormyrida- among fishes. 
It possesses in common with the Neotropical Realm Characinid, Cichlid, 

NAT MUS 98 70 



1202 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

and Dipnoaii fisbes, Pleurodire tortoises, aud Ratite and Trogonoid 
birds; aud differs from it in the absence of Arciferous Batracbia aud 
Orotalid snakes, and presence of Dendraspid, Causid, Atractaspid, and 
Viperid snakes. 

The Arctogcean Realm is characterized by the absence of types con- 
spicuous elsewhere, and by the presence of a few peculiar forms. Among 
fishes it lacks Dipnoi and Crossopterygia, Osteoglossidaj, Characinidic, 
and Cichlidw. It lacks Pleurodire tortoises aud Katite birds. Gingly- 
modous fishes aud Urodele Batracbia are nearly confined to it, merely 
extending a little over the border of the Neotropical. Its Oryptodire 
tortoises extend both into the Neotropical and Ethiopian. Anguid 
lizards are confined to it. It shares most of its Mammalia with other 
regions. The Insectivora it shares with the Ethiopian, aud its deer 
aud camels with the Neotropical. The genus Ursus is very character- 
istic, one aberrant species only extending into the Neotropical. 

From what has preceded it is seen that the primaiy differences 
between the faunae of the realms are to be found to a large degree in 
the lower Vertebrata, the fishes, Batracbia, and Keptilia. These forms 
furnish stronger distinctions than the birds and mammals, owing to 
their greater inability to traverse natural boundaries. Neglect of these 
indications has led to much of the difference of opinion in the question 
of geographical distribution, which has been founded principally on 
the conditions presented by the birds and Mammalia. 

In this system fragments of existing or old continents, which have 
been subjected to conditions unfavorable to particular forms of life 
otherwise prevalent in them, are, as in the system of Sclater, disre- 
garded. Thus, islauds generally are not regarded as presenting con- 
ditions definitive of divisions of the first rank, as was done by Huxley 
and Gill in the case of New Zealand, and Gill and Lydekker in the 
Polynesian Islands. The temperate regions of Africa and South 
America are certainly not separable from the tropical portions as 
divisions of primary rank, as was done by Allen, who is followed as to 
South America by Gill. With equal propriety western North America 
might be separated from Mississippi and Atlantic North America, on 
account of the great deficiency of its fish fauna. In estimating faunis- 
tic affinities one has to give similarities over a given area more weight 
than differences, where the differences are only due to absence of tyi)es. 

Finally, it must be remembered that there are geographic points of 
transition between all the realms. 

THE ARCTOG/EAN REALM. 

This realm includes three regions, namely, tbe Fndian, the Holarctic, 
and the Medicolumbian. I have already defined the first two in gen- 
eral terms. The third is the Transitional of Heilprin, tlie Sonoran of 
Merriam and Lydekker, and the Neotemperate of Town send. It 
embraces what is left of the Nearctic of Sclater after the subtraction 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 1203 

of the Holarctic. As the name Souorau has been previously j^iven by 
me to one of tlie districts of this legiou, I have preferred to use for it 
the name given by ]>lanford. 

The faunal characteristics of these regions may be enumerated as 
follows: 

Tndimi Region. — Presence of Ilolostomatous fishes. Absence of 
(iiiiglyniodous, Ilalecomorphous, and Sahiiouid fishes. Presence of 
Cu'ciliid Patrachia. Absence of Trachystoinatous. Amphiumid, Cryp- 
tobranchid, and Arciferons Patrachia. Presence of Agamid lizards, 
and Angiostomatous and Vi[)erid snakes. I'resence of Phasianid, 
Euryhemid, JSTectariniid, and Pittid birds. Absence of Tyrannid and 
of several nine-quilled oscine families. Presence of Nomarthrous 
Edentata, of Viverridie, Hya-nida', Tupauida^, and Tarsiidu'. Presence 
of Rliinocerotida', Tapirida-, Proboscidia, Catarrhine (^nadrumana, 
and Anthropomori)ha. Absence of Didelphyidte, Procyonida-, and 
Scalopidffi. 

Holarctic Region. — Absence of llolostomatons and Halecomorphous 
fishes. Presence of Ginglyniodous and Salmonid fishes. Absence of 
Trachystomatous, Amphiumid, and (Ju-ciliid Batrachia, and absence 
of the Arcifera, except the family J^iscoglossida' (two species of ffi/la 
excepted). Absence of Angiostomatous and presence of Viperid 
snakes. Presence of Phasianid, and absence of Euryhemid, Necta- 
riuiid, Pittid, and Tyrannid birds, and of several nine quilled oscine 
families or subfamilies. Absence of Nomarthrous iulentata, of \'iver- 
ridte, Uyamida', Tup;eiida^, lihinocerotida', Tapirida', Proboscidia, 
Quadrumana, and Anthropomorpha (except Homo). 

Medicolumhian h'a/ion. — Absence of Ilolostomatous fishes; presence 
of Ginglyniodous and Ilalecomorphous fishes. Presence of Trachy- 
stomatous, Ami)hiumid, Arciferons, and Eirmisternial Batrachia, 
and absence of Ca'ciliida*. Presence of Iguanid, and absence of Aga- 
mid and Chamadeonid lizards; absence (except three species) of Angio- 
stomatous and of Vii)erid snakes. Absence of the Indian types of 
Passeres mentioned, and presence of Tyrannid Clamatores, and several 
groups of nine-<iuilled Oscines (Icterida-, Mniotiltidu', Tanagridu'). 
Absence of all the s[)ecially Indian INIannnalia, and of the Holarctic 
Erinaceida', and presence of Didelphyidic (one species), Talpida*, and 
Procyonidai. 

In defining these regions 1 have restricted myself necessarily to types 
of tolerably high rank, and have not referred to species. This is 
because species are not generally characteristic of entire divisions, but 
only of parts of them. One can not, however, be absolutely exact in 
su(;li major definitions, since a number of the conspicuous tyi)es in each 
are not universally distributed over these areas. 

In comparing the Ilolarctic with other realms, I have already referred 
to the number of types which it i)osscss(^8 in common with the Ethi- 
o[)ian, not found in the Neotropical. It has also several in common

with tlie Neotropical, which do not occur iu the Ethiopian. These 
are the Arciferous Batrachia, the Crotalid snakes, and the deer 
(Gervidte), The Medicolumbian division of the Holarctic shares other 
forms with the Neotropical. These are Didelphyidjie and Procyonida' 
among Mammalia; Tyraunid, Icterid, and Tanagrid birds; Cinosternid 
tortoises, and the Arciferous Batrachian family Hylidas. 

Some of the forms of the Holarctic region are not uniformly dis 
tributed over it. Thus the Gingiymodous and Polyodontid lishes only 
occur in the eastern parts of the eastern and western continents. The 
same is true of the Siluroid genus Amelurns and the Loricate genus 
Alligator. The Crotalid snakes are not found in the western part of 
Eurasia. The Batrachian Cryptobranchidaj have the same distribu- 
tion. 

The Medicolumbian Region. 

This region was formerly included in the Nearctic of Sclater, and the 
area thus constituted has the following geographic boundaries: To the 
south it includes the plateau of Mexico, including the central valley. 
The Neotroi)ical area bounds it to the east and west, occupying the 
lowlands, or Tierra Caliente, to a point 150 miles south of the Eio 
Grande on the east,' and to Mazatlan, or some point not far from it, on 
the west. The high laud of Oaxaca is its extreme southern outpost. 
Its northern boundary is thus described by Merriam: ^ 

Tlio Boreal (Holarctic realm) Province extends oblu^uely across the entire con- 
tinent from New England and Newfoundland to Alaska, conforming in direction to 
the trend of the northern whores of the continent. It gives otf three long arms or 
chains of islands which reach far south along the three great mountain systems of 
the United States, a western arm in the Cascades and Sierra Nevada, a central arm 
in the Rocky Mountains, and an eastern arm hi the Alleghanies, and these interdig- 
itate with northward prolongations of the Sonoran (Medicolumbian) province, which 
latter completely surrounds the southern islands of the Boreal (Holarctic) system. 

The faunal relations of the Medicolumbian realm may be tabulated 
as follows :

Baird' divided this rejiiou into three districts, which he termed the 
Eastern, Central, and Western. The Eastern occupied eastern Xorth 
America to the central plains, where they exceed 800 feet above sea 
level. The Western included the territory between the Cascade and 
Sierra Nevada Mountains and tlie Pacific Ocean. In my paper of 1875- 1 
adopted the Eastern, Central, and Western districts (calling- the last the 
Pacific), and proposed two other districts, namely, the Austroriparian 
for the Louisianian division of the eastern of Verrill, and the Sono- 
ran for the southwestern and Mexican Plateau fauna'. Merriam, ■ in 
1800, proposed a dift'erent arrangement. Using the name Sonoran for 
the entire Medicolumbian Region, he divided it into — 

(1) an Afid or Sonoran snbregion proper, occupying the tablo-land of Mexico, 
reaching nortli into western Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and southern California; 

(2) a Californian snbregion, occupying the greater part of the State of that name; 

(3) a Lower Californian snbregion; (4) a (Ircat Basin snbregion, occupying the area 
between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada, extending as far north as the 
plains of the Cohinibia; (5) a Great Plains sul)region, occupying the plains east of 
the Rocky Mountains, and extending north to the plains of the Saskatchewan ; and 
(6) a Louisianian or Anstroriparian snbregion, occupying tlie lowlands bordering the 
Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi, and extending eastward south of the Alleglianies 
to the Atlantic seaboard where it reaches as far north as the mouth of Chesapeake 
Hay. 

According to his arrangement the Eastern region of Uaird and myself 
is not mentioned. 

This classification may be api>licable to birds and mamnuils; but it is 
not applicable to the fishes, batrachia, and reptilia, wliicli are much 
more exact indicators of the histories of fauna;, owing to their inferior 
powers of migration. The eastern district or snbregion is more nearly 
allied, from this i)oint of view, to the Austrorii)arian than the latter is 
to the Sonoran proper, or arid region. This is due, as Baird previ-

1206 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

ously pointed out, to the great difference in rainfall between the part 
of the continent lying eastward of the one-hundredth meridian and 
that i^art which lies west of it. This difference is coincident with a 
profound difference in geologic age between the regions west of that 
meridian and the eastern district, the former having a short conti- 
nental history as compared with the latter. 

I, however, agree with Merriam in the abolition of the "Central" as 
a subregion of Medicolumbia. 

The relation of the several zoological divisions to these subregions 
are as follows : The eastern subregion is the original center of distri- 
bution of all the fishes peculiar to the Medicoliimbian region, except 
only the Plagopterine Cyprinida'. It is the center of distribution of all 
the Batrachia, with the following exceptions: The degenerate types of 
Trachystomata and Amphiamidte probably originated in the A.ustro- 
riparian subregion, and the species of Bufo in the Sonoran. The east- 
ern snl)region is also the source of the aquatic Testudinata. On the 
other hand the Sauria of the eastern and Austrorij)arian subregions 
are ail overflow from tlie abundant lizard life of the Sonoran legion, 
excepting the family of tlie skinks, and the genus Anolis, the latter 
being of ]S"eotro])ical origin. The snakes also are mainly Sonoran 
types, including especially the true rattlesnakes. The copperheads 
and ground rattlesnakes are on the contrary indigenous to the eastern 
subregion. The Pacific subregion has close affinities with the Sonoran, 
but of a largely different kind as to its lizards, while the Batrachia 
have the character of the eastern types as far as they go. 

The distribution of types indicates six i^rincipal subdivisions, which 
I call the Floridan, Austroriparian, Eastern, Sonoran, Western, and 
Toltecan subregions. The Floridan subregion includes the greater 
part of the peninsula of Florida, being bounded approximately on the 
west by the Suwanee River. The Austroriparian subregion extends 
northward from the Gulf of Mexico to the isothermal of 77° F. It 
begins near Norfolk, Virginia, and occupies a belt along the coast, 
extending inland in North Carolina. It ])asses south of the Georgia 
mountains, and to the northwestward up the Mississippi Valley to the 
southeastern part of Illinois. West of the Mississippi the bouudsirv 
crosses Missouri, extends south along the southern boundary of high 
lauds of Texas, and reaches the Gulf at the moutli of the Eio Grande. 
The Eastern suhngion is the most extended, reaching from the iso- 
thermal line of 77° F. north and from the Atlantic Ocean to the elevate d 
plains west of the Mississip])i River. Many of its forms extend up ti e 
bottoms of the rivers which flow to the eastward through the plains. 
The Sonoran subregion extends from the limit of the Eastern as fur 
west as the Sierra Nevada, and south, including Nevada, New Mexico, 
Arizona, Sonora, and the Plateau of Mexico, including the State of Chi- 
huahua, and, i)erhaps, Durango. It does not cross the Sierra Nevada, 
but includes the entire peninsula of Lower California. It extends north- 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 1207 

ward on the east side of the Sierra Nevada as far as, including the arid 
region of British Columbia. It occupies the valley of the Itio Grande, 
aud extends into Texas as far as the Kio Pecos. It extends south- 
ward in western Mexico as far as Mazatlan. The Western nuhregion 
extends from the Pacific coast to the Sierra Nevada to an uncertain 
distance on the Lower Californian peninsula. At the north it crosses 
the Sierra Nevada, skips the narrow strip of the Sonoran in Washing- 
ton, and extends to the Rocky Mountains, including northern Idaho 
and western Montana. The Toltecan ftiibregion in(;ludes the States of 
Guanajuato, Mexico, and the adjacent elevated regions of Michoacan, 
Oaxaca, and Puebla, including the Alpine regions of the southern Sierra 
Madre. It is probable that another subregion should be added, the 
Taynanlipan of Townsend. This is a dry region extending frf)m near 
the mouth of the Kio Grande to the Kio Soto la Marina, in the State of 
Tamaulipas, More information regarding the fauna of this country is 
desirable. 

The faunal peculiarities of these subregions are well marked. The 
three subregions included in eastern North America differ from all the 
others in the abundance of their turtles and the small number of their 
lizards. Prolific of life, this area is not subdivided by any marked 
mitural barriers. Hence, though its species present great varieties in 
extent of range, it is not divided into districts which are very sharply 
defined. The warmer regions are much richer in birds, reptiles, and 
insects than the cooler; and as we advance northward many species 
disappear, while a few others are added. The natural division of the 
eastern part of the continent is then in a measure dependent on the 
isothermal lines which traverse it, which accord also quite closely with 
its geologic history. 

The FlorUJan subregion is distinguished by the presence of several 
peculiar genera of Batrachia and Keptilia, and by a number of i)e<*uliar 
species. A special feature is the almost total absence of Batrachia 
Urodela. The genera aie: 

TIATRACHIA. 

Lithodytes. Pseudohranchus. 

SERPENTES. 

Stilosoma. Uhadincca. 

ISeminatrix. lAodytes. 

SAIIRIA. 
Bliinenra. Sph cvrodactt/his. 

Lithodytes and S2)ha;rodactyIiis are West Indian Neotropical genera, 
and Zv'/tar/inrm, besides being Neotropical, extends into the eastern i)art 
of the Austroriparian subregion. Five genera are then peculiar. The 



1208 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

ix'cnliar species will be eniinierated later. Several species of mammals 
are coiiMued to tliis subrejiiioii. The genera of birds that do not rauge 
north of it are, according to Allen: 

Certhiola. Aramus i 

Zenaida ■\ Auduhonia ] 

Oreopelia \ Pigeons. Phmnicopterus. 

IStartiOBiias Haliplami > ^

The isolation of the Floridan subregion is due to the fact that the 
nucleus of the peninsula (which is of Eocene age) was separated from 
the continent during the greater part of Neocene time. If at any time 
connected with the Antilles, the period was of short duration. 

The Austroriparian subregion possesses many peculiar genera of rep- 
tiles not found elsewhere, while the region north of it possesses none, 
its genera being distributed over some or all of the remainiiig regions. 
The number of peculiar species in all departments of animal life is 
large. It presents the greatest development of the eastern reptile life. 
Sixteen genera of Iveptiles and eight of Batrachia do not range to the 
northward, Avhile ninety-nine species are restricted in the same man- 
ner. The peculiar genera which occur over most of its area are: 

Saukia. Testudinata, 

Anolis. ' Macrochelys. 

Serpentes. Loricata. 

Elaps. Alligator. 

Haldea. Batrachia. 

Gemophora. IJngystoma. 

Tantilla. Maneulus. 

Compsosoma. Amphiuma. 

Farancia. Siren. 

I have omitted from this list ten genera which are restricted to one 
or the other of its subdivisions. Siren, Gemophora, Anolis, and Alli- 
gator are the most striking of the above characteristic genera. No 
genus of lizards is peculiar excepting Anolis, which has its greatest 
development in other than the Nearctic continent. Among serpents 
a few genera of Neotropical character extend eastward along the 
region of the Mexican Gulf, as far as the Atlantic coast, which are 
not found in any of the northern regions; such are Gompsosoma (Cen- 
tral American), Tantilla, and Elaps (Sonoran). On the other hand, 
Ahastor, Virginia, Haldea, ami Storeria embrace serpents which it shares 
with the Eastern region. 

This region is the headquarters of the Batrachia, especially of the 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS. AND SNAKES. 1209 

tiiiled forms. The majority of species of the tailless genera me found 
here, esi)eci}il]y of Ilyla (tree toads). Nana, and Ghorophilus. 

There are no less than nine genera of birds which do not, oi- only 
accidentally, range northward of this district. They are, according to 
Allen: 

Plains. Gonurns. 

Tantahia. Cli ama'peUa. 

Plotalea. Campephiluti. 

Elanns. Helhuca. 
Jctinia. 

All these genera, excepting the last, rang»^ into South America or 
further. 

Among mammals, but few species and one genus [Sifimodon) are con- 
fined to it. Lepvs (ujnaficns and L. jfolusfris, the cotton rat, etc., and a 
few others, are restricted by it. The tish fauna Is very similar to that 
of the Eastern region. 

The Eastern si(hre(/ion ditt'en^ from the Austrori])arian almost entirely 
in what it lacks, and agrees with it in all those peculiarities })y which it 
is so widely separated from the Sonoran subregion. No genus of mam- 
mals is found in it which does not range into other regions, excepting 
the Insectivorous genera Parascalops and Gondylnra (star-nosed mole); 
but numerous species are confined to it, not extending into the Austro- 
rii)arian. These number from twenty to twenty-five. Among birds, 
the following genera are, according to J. A. Allen, share<l with the more 
southern region only: Quiscalus, ^ixrus, Relmitherns, Protonotarm, 
Parula, Mniotilta. ^o genus of Kej)tiles, and but one of Batrachians 
(Gyrinophilus), is confined to this region; but it shares all it possesses 
with the Austrorii)arian. It has but four genera of lizards, namely, 
Sceloporus, Gnemidopltorus, Liolepisma, and Eumeces. 

The Sonoran subregion is cliaracterized in the lower vertebrate fauna 
by great poverty in fishes, batrachians, and tortoises, and abundance 
of lizards and snakes. Among fishes it lacks the orders (iinglymodi, 
Halecomorphi, and Choudrostei, and possesses only one peculiar group, 
the PlagO|)terina% a division of the Cyprinida'. Of usual llolarctic 
types it possesses only rsos[)ondyli (Salmonida') and Plectosi)ondyli ; 
Percomorphi and Nematognathi being absent. The rivers that inter- 
sect its central district contain these types, but they must be reckoned 
as belonging with their bottom lands to the Eastern subregion; the 
high i)lains only belonging to the Sonoran. The true drainage area of 
the Sonoran subregion is that of the Colorado. 

No genus of Batrachia is peculiar to it, and the following divisions 
are wanting: Proteida, Trachystomata, Amphiumoidea, an<l all (Tro- 
dela, except Amblystomida' (one species). The genus Bu/o is the 
only one that is well represented. 



1210 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

The following genera of reptiles are peculiar to it: 

Uta. Anota. 

Uma. Lichanura. 

Sauromalus. Phyllorhynchus. 

Callisaurns. Chio n actis. 

Dipsosavrxfi. Chilomeniscn.s. 

It sliaies the following genera with the Toltecan subregion and the 
Central American subregion of the Neotropical Realm only: 

Gtenosaura. 

EuhlephartH (also in the Indian region). 

rhyllodactyhifi (also in the Columbian Neotropical). 

HclixJerma. 

Hypsiglena. 

Salvadora. 

Rhinechis (also Holarctic of Eurasia). 

ChionacUs. 

Tr'nnorphodon. 

TantiUa (also in Brazilian Neotropical). 

Cinosternum (also in Brazilian NeotrojMcal). 
The following genera of the Sonoran subregion enter the Texan dis- 
trict of the Austroriparian subregion : 

Holbrookia. Hypsiglena. 

Grotaphytus. Rhinochilus. 

Phrynosoma. Cinosternum. 
Oerrhonotus. 

Many species are peculiar to this subregion, as will be shown later on. 

The Western subregion is distinguished by the absence of most of the 
types of fishes of the humid part of the continent, and the ])resence 
of a few. Thus, the Ginglymodi. Ilalecomorphi, and Catostomidai are 
absent, while Percomorphi are present. The Batrachian fauna lacks 
the Proteida, Trachystomata, and Amphiumoidea, while Urodela are 
abundant, excepting (h-yptobranchidiv. All the families of Salientia 
characteristic of Medicolumbia are present except the EngystomidtE. 
Xmong reptiles the genus Gharina is entirely characteristic, and Gerr- 
honotus of the Toltecan and Sonoran fauna langes its entire length. 
It is especially distinguished by the absence of the following genera: 
First, all of the Iguanidai exclusively characteristic of the Sonoran 
fauna, there remaining only Grotaphytus, Sceloporus, and Phrynosoma, 
which also enter the Texan district of the Austroriparian ; by the absence 
of Heloderma, Ophisaurus, and Liolepisma. Among snakes, by the 
absence of true water snakes (genus Natrix), and the small burrowing 
Natricinai of Opisthoglyph forms, and of poisonous snakes of the genera 
Elaps and Sistrurus. No genus but Gharina can be cited as of universal 
distribution, which is not at the same time found in some other subre- 



CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 1211 

^ion; but several genera occur in one or the other of its districts whidi 
do not o(;cur elsewiiere. Similarly, no genus of birds or maniinals can 
l»(» exclusively assigned to its entire area; but Cltamcvu of the former 
(lass and Haplodontia of the latter are restricted to particular portions 
of it. 

The Toltecan auhrrginn is characterized by the genera it lacks as well 
as those which it iwssesses. Thus, it lacks all the genera of Sauria 
above cited as characteristic of the Sonoran subregion, including those 
enumerated as])assingover into the Austrorii)arian excei)t Phryuosoma. 
It also lacks the following genera of snakes which are fcmnd in the 
Sonoran : 

Liehannra. Ghilomeniseus. 

Pityophis. Zamenis, 

Ophiholu.s. Phyllorhynclms. 

From the Aiistroriparian subregion it differs in the lack of all the 
numerous genera of fishes and IJatrachia Urodela, which characterize 
it, excepting only Spelerpes. It lacks also the following genera of 
snakes; Cyclpphis, Virginia^ HaUlea, ixwd Carphophiops; and A^a/>-/.r is 
very sparsely if at all represented. 

In its i)ositive characters the Toltecan subregion combines certain 
forms of both the Sonoran and Austroriparian subregions. Of the 
former character are Spca, Phrynosoma,, Barissia, Gerrhonatus, Hypsitj- 
Icna, and Salradora; of the latter kind, iSj)elerpes, Liolepi.sma, Osceola, 
Storeria, and iSistrurus. Characteristic of Medicolumbia generally: 
Anihlystoma, Rana, Sceloporus, Eumeees, Diadophis, JSutwnia, Grotalus. 
Peculiar genera. 

Siredon. Conopsis. 

Thorins. Epif/lottopliis. 

Malachylodes. Ophry((cvs. 

Neotropical genera: (Ediptis, Anolis, Gelestns, AtractuH, Ninia, Dry- 
mobius, Bothriechis. 

I. TIIK EASTERN SUBREGION. 

The fauna of Batracliia and Keptilia of this subregion is characterized 
by what it lacks as much as by what it possesses. The numbei* of 
species which occupy its entire extent exclusively of other subregions 
is small, while a larger number are restricted to parts of it. Verrill 
divided it into four distri<*-ts, namely, the Caroliman, the Alleghenian, 
the Canadian, and the Hudsonian. These are distinguished by the 
ranges of mammals and reptiles, and the bree(ling-[)laces of birds. The 
Carolinian fauna extends in a belt north of the Austroriparian subre- 
gion from Long Island, south of the hill region of New Jersey, to the 
southeastern (;orner of Pennsylvania, and thence inland. It embraces 
a wide belt in Maryland and Virginia, and all of central North Carolina, 
and then narrows very much in passing round south of the Alleghenies 



1212 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. 

of Georgia. It extends north again, occupying East Tennessee, West 
Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, the greater i)arts of Illinois and Oliio, and 
the southern border of Michigan. It includes southern Wisconsin and 
Minnesota, all of Iowa, and the greater part of Missouri. The Alleghe- 
nian embraces the States north of the line Just described, excepting the 
regions pertaining to the Canadian fauna, which I now describe. Tliis 
includes northern Maine, I^ew Hamjjshire, and Vermont, with the Green 
Mountains, the Adirondacks, and summits of the Allegheny Mountains 
as far as Georgia. It includes Canada east and north of the lakes. The 
Hiidsonian fauna is entirely north of the isothermal ot 50°. It has 
great extent west of Hudson Bay and is narrowed southeastward to 
Newfoundland. 

The information as to the distribution of the Batrachia and Keptilia 
now at hand, points to the following conclusions: The Hudsonian 
fauna need not be further referred to here, as it is part of the Holarctic 
region. The Canadian is sustained, as defined by the range of certain 
Batrachia. The demarkation between the Alleghenian and Carolinian 
is determined by the northern limit of most of the species common to 
the Eastern and Austroriparian subregions. An important division is 
indicated by the boundaries set to the range of certain species by the 
Allegheny Mountains. This division affects chiefly the Carolinian dis- 
trict of Verrill, and I therefore propose to abolish that name, and replace 
it by the two terms CisaUeghenian for the Eastern and Transalleglienian 
for the Western districts. They are separated from each other by tlie 
Alleghenian district of the foothills and the Canadian of the summits 
of the Allegheny Mountains. 

The species which are found over the entire Eastern subregion, and 
not elsewhere, are the following: 

Amblyatoma jejfersonianuni Green. 

Plethodon cincreus Green. 

Ran.a silvatica, Le Conte. 

liana palustris Le Conte. 

Osceola doliata triangula Boie. 

Natrix fasciata sipedon Linnauis. 

Eutamia sirtalis graminea Cope. 
The Canadian district is characterized by the following species, which 
are restricted to it: 

Ainblystoma jeffersoniannm laterale Hallowell. 

(jryrinophilus porphyrificiis Green. 

Desmognathus ochrophwa Cope. 

Desmognatkus nigra Green. 

Bufo lentiginosus foivlerti Putnam. 

Rana cantabrigensis Baird. 

Rana septentrionalis Baird. 
The list above given as universally distributed in the Eastern sub- 
region characterizes the Alleghenian district. I know of no species

that is restricted to it. The genera wliicli do not extend iioitli of it are

The two remaining districts include the hirge number of species 
which are common to the Eastern and Austroriparian snbregions 
enumerated under tlie latter head. The Cisallegheniau is furiiuT 
characterized by the following: 
Hyla andersonii Baird. 
Rana virgatipes Cope. 
Ophiholus rhombomaculatus Holbrook. 
To these must be added from the Austrorii)arian list: 

Abastor erythrof/rammus Daudin. 
The following species are peculiar to the Transalleghenian district: 
Chondrotus microstomus Cope. 
Spelerpes maculicandns Cope. 
Kami areolata circnlosa Kice and Davis.

Probably Eutmnia brachystoma Cope belongs to this district, but oidy 
one specimen has been found. 

The following species enter this district only from the Austroriparian : 
Natrix grahamii Baird and Girard. 
Eutwnia proxima Say. 
Of the species peculiar to the Transalleghenian district, Ophibolus 
calligaster and Tropidoclonium lineatum extend into the northern limits 
of the Texan district. 

The genera which do not range northward of the Cisallegheniau dis- 
trict are Cnemidophorus^ I/iolepismaj and Abastor.

II. THE AUSTROHIPARIAN SUBREGION. 

This subregiou is the rauge of a large uumber of species of I>atracliia 
and Eeptilia, only a part of which occupy it to the exclusion of all other 
subregions, and another series of which occupy parts only of its area. 
Three centers of distribution within its borders may be discerned — the 
Ocimdgiaii, the Louisianimi, and the Texan. The Texan is especially 
characterized by the combination of the Austroriparian fauna with a 
considerable number of the species of the Sonoran subregion. The 
characteristic Austroriparian species are the following:

Total - 115 

The species which enter the Texan territory from the Sonoran extend 
to various distances to the north and east. Thus, GrotaphytKS collaris 
ranges to southern Missouri, and Holbroolcia i)iaculata to Arkansas. 
Sceloporus spinosus extends along the Gulf States to western Florida. 
Phrynosoma cornutum extends eastward to Dallas, Texas. Bhinochilus 
leconteij on the other hand, has not been found east of Austin. Several 
species from the extreme southwest of Texas have not been included 
in the above lists, since some of them are well known to belong to the 
Central American fauna, while the range of others is probably similar, 
but is not sufficiently known. Of the former kind are Drymobms mar- 
garitiferus Schlegel, Sihon albofuscum Lac^pede, and Coniophanes inipe- 
rialis Baird and Girard, of the latter are Lysoptychns lateralis Cope, 
Holhroolda proprimjua Baird and Girard, and Hypopachus cuneus Cope.

IV. THE SONORAN SUBREGION. 

This subregion presents several natural divisions, as follows: I. The 
Lower Cali/ornian district, including only the region at the extremity 
of the peninsula of Lower California; II. The Chihuahuan district^ 
embracing the State of Sonora, Mexico, the northern part of the Mexican 
Plateau, Arizona south of the San Francisco Mountains; most of the 
peninsula of Lower California, and most of New Mexico; III. The 
Basin district, embracing the Great Basin of Utah and Oregon, to Ver- 
non, British Columbia; and IV. The Central district, which includes 
the high plains east of the Rocky Mountains, from Texas northward, 
excei)ting the river bottoms which cross it from west to east. This 
great subregion is bound together by the general distribution of numer- 
ous genera; but I do not know a single species which covers its entire 
area which is not found elsewhere. These define the districts. 

The Lower Californian district is defined by the following fourteen 
species, which are restricted to it : 

Ilyla curta Cope. 

Gtenosaura hcmilopha Cope. 

Cfta thalassina Cope. 

Uta nigricauda Cope.

nata are peculiar to this district, namely, Cinosternum henrici Lecepede; 
G. iiavesceiis Agassiz, and Xcrobatcs agasshii Cooper. This district 
possesses a larger number of i)eculiar species than auy other in the 
Medicolumbian Kegion. 

The Basin district has but few peculiar species. Its southern bound- 
ary may be regarded as the San Francisco Mountains in northern Ari- 
zona. The Grotalus tigris, which is restricted to it, has been shown by 
Dr. Merriara to inhabit only the mountains, and its northern limit is 
as yet unknown. The following are the species of the Great Basin :

V. THE WESTERN SUBREGION. 

This subregion presents two distinct modifications, a northern and a 
southern. The boundary between the two has not yet l)een dehned; 
it represents the demarkation between the greater iiuinidity of the 
north and the arid conditions of the south. The name J)ief/<m has 
been given by Mr. Van Deuburgh to the southern region; to the 
northern 1 propose to restrict the name Pacijic, which 1 formerly used 
for the entire subregion, which had been previously named the Western 
by Baird. The Pacific district extends farther south along the Sierra 
Nevada than in the San Joaquin Valley. Some of the forms of the 
Diegan district extend north to the latitude of San Francisco, but the 
majority of the species are restricted to more southern latitudes. TIow 
far the Diegan district extends on the Lower Californian Peninsula is 
uncertain. The separation from the Chihuahuan district is also unde- 
termined, and the species of both districts mingle in some degree on 
their borders. 

Species peculiar to the Diegan district are the following: 

BATRACHIA. 

Rufo Golumbiensis halopliila Baird and Girard. 

SAURIA. 

Uta repens Van Denburgh.

These species are then characteristic of the Western subregion as a 
whole, except those marked with a star, which occur elsewhere. 

The Pacific district is especially characterized by certain genera and 
species of Batracibi*. No certainly known genus of scaled reptiles 
and a limited number of species and subsiDBcies are peculiar to it. Con- 
spicuous among these are the species of Entwnia, which display great 
variety, while they are but sparsely represented in the Diegau district. 
The peculiar species are as follows : 

URODELA.

VI. THE TOLTECAN SUBREGION. 

This subregion includes three districts which possess characteristic 
species and whicli differ iu climate. The Austr oriental is a humid 
region, with abundant rains and fogs, and includes the eastern face and 
slope of the central plateau, with the mountain elevations, including 
parts of the States of Puebla, Vera Ornz, Hidalgo, and San Luis 
Potosi. It is cut off to the north from the Austroriparian subregion by 
an interval in the States of ISTuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. The middle 
or Anstrocentral district includes the valleys of Mexico and Toluca, 
and the region northward to the edge of the Sonoran subregion, includ- 
ing the State of Guanajuato, and perhaps farther north. The climate 
of this district is much less humid than that of tlie Austroriental dis- 
trict. The Anstroccidental district includes the high lauds of Oaxaca, 
Guerrero, Michoacan, and Jalisco. It is the most arid of the three 
divisions and extends farthest to the south and west. 

The northern boundary of the Toltecan subregion is not yet determina- 
ble; hence it is not possible to state whether species from the States 
of Durango and Zacatecas, such as Eutwnia angustirostris, should be 
referred to it or not. A small collection made by Wilkinson in south- 
ern Chihuahua at Batopilas^ has the character of the Chihuahuan 
fauna, with the following species not otherwise found in it: 
Anolis nehnlosus Wiegmann. 
Uta hicarinata Dumeril. 
Scolecophis (vmnlus Co])e. 

The humid and dry districts of the Toltecan subregion repeat in petto 
the differences between the Austroriparian and Sonoran subregions. 
The Austroriental district is distinguished by the larger number of 
batrachian genera and species and of certain genera of Crotalidte. It 
also includes some genera which may be regarded as immigrants from 
the Central American region of the Neotropical realm. 

The characteristic species of the Austroceatral district are:^

The Austroccidental district is inhabited by a number of peculiar
