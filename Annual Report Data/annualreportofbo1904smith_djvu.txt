REPORT 



THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE I T . S. NATIONAL MUSEUM 
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1904. 

. By Richard Rathbun, 
Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, incharge of the U. S. National Museum. 

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 

The United States National Museum had its origin in the act of 
Congress of 1846 founding the Smithsonian Institution, which made 
the formation of a museum one of the principal functions of the 
latter, and provided that — 

Whenever suitable arrangements can be made from time to time for their recep- 
tion, all objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural 
history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United 
States, which may be in the city of Washington, in. whosesoever custody they may 
be, shall be delivered to such persona as may be authorized by the Board of Regents 
to receive them, and shall be so arranged and classified in the building erected for 
the Institution as best to facilitate the examination and study of them; and when- 
ever new specimens in natural history, geology, or mineralogy are obtained for the 
museum of the Institution, by exchanges of duplicate specimens, which the Regents 
may in their discretion make, or by donation, which they may receive, or otherwise, 
the Regents shall cause such new specimens to be appropriately classed and arranged. 

The principal and accrued interest of the Smithsonian fund 
amounted at that time to about $750,000, a sum considered ample to 
meet the needs of the various operations in which it was proposed that 
the Smithsonian Institution should engage. In 1846 probably not 
more than one or two universities or learned establishments in Amer- 
ica had so large an endowment, and it w r as apparently the idea of 
Congress that the fund was sufficient both for the erection of a build- 
ing and for the care of the collections which would be turned over 
to it or acquired by the national surveys, and in other ways. The 
Museum thus began as an integral part of the Institution, coordinate 
with its library, and was required by law to provide for the Govern- 
ment collections which had previously accumulated, a duty which the

Institution did not see its way clear to fulfill until 1858, when Con- 
gress began to make small yearly appropriations to aid in this purpose. 
So inadequate, however, were the sums voted that for many years the 
slender income of the Institution continued to be drawn upon to insure 
the maintenance of what was then justly called the Smithsonian 
Museum, since the building was paid for out of the Smithson fund, a 
considerable portion of the collections was and still is the property of 
the Institution, through exploration and gift, and a number of the offi- 
cials connected with the Museum were employed at its expense. 

The first scientific collection to come into the possession of the Insti- 
tution — and, in fact, it accompanied the bequest — was the small but 
valuable mineralogical cabinet of James Smithson, the founder, who 
was himself a chemist and mineralogist of repute and a Fellow of the 
Royal Society of London. 

The nucleus of the National Museum was, however, virtually acquired 
by the National Institute, a society organized in Washington about 
1840, having for its avowed purpose the direction of the Smithson 
bequest and the pursuit of objects in consonance with the terms of that 
foundation. One of these objects was the gathering of historical and 
natural history specimens from both official and private sources, most 
prominent among the former having been the United States Exploring 
Expedition around the world from 1838 to 1842. Rooms in the Patent 
Office building were secured for the museum of the society, which was 
practically recognized as the appropriate place of deposit for all Gov- 
ernment collections retained in Washington. Another important serv- 
ice rendered by the society was, as the late Dr. G. Brown Goode has 
said, in the direction of educating public opinion " to consider the 
establishment of such an institution worthy of the Government of the 
United States." Failing, however, to secure the public recognition at 
which it aimed, it became inactive upon the establishment of the Smith- 
sonian Institution in 1846, and its charter, which expired in 1861, was 
not renewed. The Government collections in its possession, which 
came practically under the care of the Commissioner of Patents, were 
turned over to the Smithsonian Institution in 1858. Other material 
directly under the control of the National Institute remained at the 
Patent Office until 1862, and a part of the historical objects were held 
there until 1883. 

Previous to 1858, however, important materials for a museum were 
being accumulated at the Smithsonian Institution, at its own cost and 
through the activities of its assistant secretary, Prof. Spencer F. 
Baird, beginning even before his appointment to that office in L850. 
The personal bent of Professor Baird was toward the collection of 
natural history specimens for purposes of study. With the approval 
of Secretary Henry he put into operation plans for the accomplish- 
ment of this object, which, fostered and encouraged, were soon yield- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 5 

ing regular and abundant returns. Professor Baird's own vacations 
were spent in field work. Officers of the Army and Navy and of other 
branches of the Government service, fishermen, fur traders, private 
explorers, and such powerful organizations as the Hudson's Bay Com- 
pany and the Western Union Telegraph Company, were enlisted in 
the work and rendered valuable assistance. The influence exerted by 
these beginnings has been lasting and widespread, as shown in the 
extensive natural history operations of subsequent National and State 
surveys, the organization of the Fish Commission and Bureau of Eth- 
nology, and the support given to scientific collecting by many other 
bureaus of the Government. 

The discussion of plans for the organization of the Smithsonian 
Institution, which devolved upon the first Board of Regents, led. in 
January, 1847, to the unanimous adoption of the following resolution 
expressing approval of the museum feature as one of its important 
functions: 

Resolved, That it is the intention of the act of Congress establishing the Institution, 
and in accordance with the design of Mr. Smithson, as expressed in his will, that 
one of the principal modes of executing the act and the trust is the accumulation of 
collections of specimens and objects of natural history and of elegant art, and the 
gradual formation of a library of valuable works pertaining to all departments of 
human knowledge, to the end that a copious storehouse of materials of science, 
literature, and art may be provided, which shall excite and diffuse the love of learn- 
ing among men, and shall assist the original investigations and efforts of those who 
may devote themselves to the pursuit of any branch of knowledge." 

The policy thus announced has prevailed to the present da} T . 

In 1879, when most of the existing Government surveys, whose 
work included the collecting of specimens in the field, had been estab- 
lished, Congress deemed it important to practically reenforce the pro- 
visions of the act founding the Institution, in order that there might 
be no doubt as to the proper disposition of the material certain to be 
derived from these various sources, by the following enactment in the 
sundry civil appropriation act for 1880: 

All collections of rocks, minerals, soils, fossils, and objects of natural history, 
archeology, and ethnolgy, made by the Coast and Interior Survey, the Geological 
Survey, or by any other parties for the Government of the United States, when no 
longer needed for investigations in progress shall be deposited in the National 
Museum. 

Although the name ""National Museum" was sometimes used in the 
earlier reports of the Smithsonian Institution, it did not appear in any 
of the laws of> Congress until 1875. Its general employment may be 
said to date from the time of the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition 
of 1876, the first exposition in this country in which the Government 
participated, and the first to make known to vast numbers of the 
people of the United States the existence of national collections at 



"Report of Committee on Organization, p. 20. 



6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Washington, as well as new methods of installing- and exhibiting 
museum materials, differing radically from the older cabinets of col- 
lege or local museums, which had prevailed up to that period. After 
its close the Government exhibits brought back to Washington, 
together with the extensive gifts made to the United States by private 
persons and foreign governments, rendered necessary the early erec- 
tion of a new and separate building, devoted entirely to museum 
purposes. Since that time Congress has mainly provided for the 
maintenance of the Museum, but its management remains, by the 
fundamental act, under the authority of the Regents of the Smithso- 
nian Institution, administered through their Secretary, who is ex officio 
the keeper — a form of government insuring a consistent and uniform 
policy and a nonpartisan administration of its affairs. The greater 
part of the Smithsonian building is still used for museum purposes, 
and the Institution, as well as most of the scientific bureaus at Wash- 
ington, cooperate, both through men and material, in enlarging and 
caring for the national collections. 

The scope of the National Museum as defined by law comprises 
practically all branches of science and of the arts which admit of 
museum treatment. With exceedingly limited means for making pur- 
chases, and therefore almost entirely dependent as to the character 
of its collections upon Government explorations, personal donations, 
and exchanges, its different departments have had a very unequal 
growth. The subjects best represented are American ethnology and 
archeology, geology, zoology, and botany. A fair beginning has been 
made in the exceedingly important branches of the industrial arts 
and American history, and scarcely more is required to place these 
two departments on a proper basis than sufficient room to display 
the necessary collections, which are certain to be received, in greater 
part through gratuitous contributions, when it is known that the 
Museum is prepared to care for them. In the department of the fine 
arts the collection is still very small, but the subject is one which 
must sooner or later receive earnest consideration by the Government. 

The specimens in all branches are classified in two series; one, com- 
prising the bulk of the material, being arranged for the purposes of 
scientific research and reference in laboratories and storerooms, to 
which students are freely admitted; the other, selected with regard to 
their general educational value and public interest, and accompanied 
by descriptive labels, being displayed in glass-covered cases in the 
public halls. The duplicate specimens not required for exchanges 
are made up into sets for distribution to schools and colleges, as 
opportunity offers. Papers descriptive of the collections, both tech- 
nical and popular, are published for gratuitous circulation to the 
extent of three or more volumes yearly, and, finally, the Museum 
has come to be regarded as a bureau of information in respect to all 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 7 

subjects with which it is oven in the remotest degree concerned, the 
correspondence which this involves now constituting one of its heaviest 
tasks. 

The history of the Museum, as pointed out by the late Doctor Goode, 
may be divided into three epochs, which he characterized as follows: 

First, the period from the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution to 1857, dur- 
ing which time specimens were collected solely to serve as materials for research. 
No special effort was made to exhibit them to the public or to utilize them, except 
as a foundation for scientific description and theory. 

Second, the period from L857, when the Institution assumed the custody of the 
" National Cabinet of Curiosities," to 1876. During this period the Museum became 
a place of deposit for scientific collections which had already been studied, these col- 
lections, so far as convenient, being exhibted to the public and, so far as practicable, 
made to serve an educational purpose. 

Third, the present period (beginning in the year 1876), in which the Museum has 
undertaken more fully the additional task of withering collections and exhibiting 
them on account of their value from an educational standpoint. 

During the first period the main object of the Museum was scientific research; in 
the second, the establishment became a museum of record as well as of research, 
while in the third period has been added the idea of public education. The three 
ideas — record, research, and education — cooperative and mutually helpful as they 
are, are essential to the development of every great museum. The National Museum 
endeavors to promote them all. 

In the same connection, Doctor Goode also defined the scope and 
objects of the Museum in the following concise manner: 

It is a museum of record, in which are preserved the material foundations of an 
enormous amount of scientific knowledge — the types of numerous past investigations. 
This is especially the case with those materials that have served as a foundation for 
the reports upon the resources of the United States. 

It is a museum of research, which aims to make its contents serve in the highest 
degree as a stimulus to inquiry and a foundation for scientific investigation. Research 
is necessary in order to identify and group the objects in the most philosophical and 
instructive relations, and its officers are therefore selected for their ability as investi- 
gators, as well as for their trustworthiness as custodians. 

It is an educational museum, through its policy of illustrating by specimens every 
kind of natural object and every manifestation of human thought and activity, of 
displaying descriptive labels adapted to the popular mind, and of distributing its 
publications and its named series of duplicates. 

AS A MUSEUM OF RECORD. 

In its function as a museum of record the growth of the National 
Museum has been unprecedented, due mainly to the rapid exploration 
and development of a rich and extensive country under the liberal 
and progressive policy of the Government. From scientific institu- 
tions throughout the world, from foreign governments, and from indi- 
viduals abundant stores of great value have been received, either as 
gifts or through the medium of exchange of specimens, and a small 
appropriation in recent }^ears has permitted of some purchases to 
supply desiderata. 



8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

The principal sources of the collections may be briefly summarized 
as follows: 

1. The explorations carried on more or less directly under the 
auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, or by the Institution in con- 
nection with educational institutions or commercial establishments, 
and the efforts, since 1850, of its officers and correspondents toward 
the accumulation of natural history and anthropological material. 

2. The United States Exploring Expedition around the world from 
1838 to 1842, the North Pacific, or Perry, Exploring- Expedition from 
1853 to 1856, and many subsequent naval expeditions down to and 
including the recent operations in the West Indian and Philippine 
waters. 

3. The activities of members of the United States diplomatic and 
consular service abroad. 

4. The Government surveys at home, such as the Pacific Railroad 
surveys, the Mexican and Canadian boundary surve3 T s, and the surveys 
carried on by the Engineer Corps of the U. S. Army; and the activi- 
ties of officers of the Signal Corps, and other branches of the Army 
stationed in remote regions. 

5. The explorations of the U. S. Geological Survey, the U. S. Fish 
Commission, the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of American 
Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution, and other scientific branches 
of the Government. 

0. Donations and purchases in connection with the several exposi- 
tions at home and abroad in which the Museum and Fish Commission 
have participated, among these having been the Centennial Exhibition 
at Philadelphia in 1870, the International Fisheries Exhibitions at Berlin 
in 1880 and at London in 1883, the New Orleans Cotton Centennial 
Exposition in 1881 and 1885, the Cincinnati Exposition of 1888, the 
World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, the expositions at 
Atlanta in 1895, at Nashville in L897, at Omaha in L898, the Pan- 
American Exposition of 1901, and the Charleston Exposition of 
1901-02. The returns from the World's Fair in Philadelphia were of 
greatest extent, comprising, besides the collections displayed by the 
United States in illustration of the animal and mineral resources, the 
fisheries, and the ethnology of the native races of the country, valuable 
gifts from thirty of the foreign governments which participated, as 
well as the industrial collections of numerous manufacturing and com- 
mercial houses of Europe and America. 

7. Exchanges with foreign and domestic museums and with indi- 
viduals. 

Immediately preceding the Centennial Exhibition of 1870, when the 
collections were entirely provided for in the Smithsonian building, 
the number of entries of specimens in the Museum record books was 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. V> 

about 235,000. In 1884. when the additional room afforded by the new 
building gave opportunity for taking a provisional census of the large 
accessions received from Philadelphia and from other sources, the 
number had grown to 1,471,000. At the close of the year covered 
by this report the total number of recorded specimens was 5,898,493. 
While these figures convey no impression of the bulk of the collec- 
tions, when it is considered that by L885 all of the space in both build- 
ings was completely filled, and in fact so overcrowded that a third 
building was already being asked of Congress, some conception may 
be had of the conditions now existing. The storerooms are packed to 
their utmost capacity, making it difficult to gain access to the speci- 
mens or to provide adequately for their safety. For many years most 
of the objects received have had to be stored in outside and unsafe 
structures, where they are mainly piled up in the original packing- 
boxes, and where has already accumulated enough material of great 
intrinsic and scientific value to fill an additional building as large as 
that now occupied by the main collections. 

AS A MUSEUM OF RESEARCH. 

In order to permit of their examination and study, as provided in 
the act of establishment, the collections of the Museum are, to the 
extent of its accommodations, arranged systematically and in a manner 
convenient for reference. Access to the reserve or study series, so 
called, consisting of the main body of the collections and as complete 
in all the groups as the accessions have made possible, is given to all 
properly qualified persons engaged in original research. The oppor- 
tunities thus afforded are widely availed of, the Museum being visited 
every year b}^ many investigators, some of world-wide distinction, 
coming from the scientific centers of European and other foreign 
countries, as well as from all parts of the United States. Material is 
also occasionally sent out to representatives of other institutions hav- 
ing the means of providing for its safe-keeping, when required in the 
working up of special subjects, or for comparison in connection with 
their own collections. 

The custodianship of the collections being the first and most impera- 
tive duty devolving upon the scientific staff of the National Museum, 
its members find comparatively little time during office hours for 
advancing knowledge, though they are mostly well qualified for such 
work, being selected with special reference to their ability to identify 
and classify the specimens under their charge in accordance with the 
latest researches. As a matter of fact, however, the staff does pro- 
duce every year a large number of papers descriptive of the collec- 
tions, which together constitute an important contribution to scientific 
literature. 



10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Among the honorary officers having- their laboratories at the Museum 
are a number of assistants employed by other scientific bureaus to con- 
duct investigations on material kept here in their charge, and in whose 
results the Museum shares. 

Many collections have, from time to time, been transferred by the 
Geological Survey, the Fish Commission, the Department of Agricul- 
ture, and other branches of the Government to the custody of the 
Museum in advance of their final working up, in order to provide for 
their safe storage and to secure the better facilities for study here 
afforded. Under this arrangement the amount of research work car- 
ried on in the Museum building has been greatly increased. 

Though having little means to expend for field work, members of 
the Museum staff are occasionally given opportunities to participate 
in the explorations of other Government bureaus or of private expe- 
ditions, in connection with which special researches may be carried on, 
though the chief advantage results from the acquisition of new and 
valuable material and a knowledge of the conditions under which it 
occurred in nature. 

AS AN EDUCATIONAL MUSEUM. 

The educational side of the Museum is intended to consist mainly 
of an exhibition of all the classes of objects which it represents, so 
mounted, installed, and labeled as to directly interest and instruct the 
general public. The principal difficulty incident to the proper instal- 
lation of such a collection, conceding all the space required} lies in the 
selection of its parts, so that while enough is displayed to convey the 
amount of information which it is intended to impart, the visitor shall 
not be overburdened or confused with details. While this policy is 
being followed in the National Museum, so far as its means permit, 
the lack of room has always prevented a complete or satisfactory 
development of the plan, and. every succeeding year the conditions in 
this respect grow worse instead of better, through the increased crowd- 
ing of the halls. The advances in recent } 7 ears have been chiefly in 
the methods of display, in the character of individual and group 
mountings, and in the labeling, in all of which directions exceptional 
progress has been made. 

Three years ago it was announced that all of the halls designed for 
public use were then for the first time permanently open, though none 
were above addition or improvement, while in some the arrangement 
was entirely provisional. This was accomplished only by the transfer 
of large quantities of material to outside storage, hut it has unfortu- 
nately been again necessary to shut off one or more of the halls from 
time to time, in order to furnish increased space for workrooms. 

In this connection it seems appropriate to refer to the work of 
Doctor Goode, than whom no museum administrator ever had a better 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 11 

understanding of the public needs. He labored earnestly and con- 
scientiously to make this a museum for as well as of the people, and 
the plans now being carried out are, in all their essential features, of 
his making-. While the assistants might be relied upon to arrange and 
maintain the study series in a manner acceptable to the specialist, the 
interests of the public always remained in his immediate charge. He 
was ever occupied in devising ways for so presenting the features of 
nature and the activities of mankind that by the very force of his sur- 
roundings the visitor was bound to receive and carry with him some 
definite impression, some new bit of knowledge. Doctor Goode's 
labors in this held ranged from the planning of the general scheme to 
the most minute details of case architecture and fittings. His official 
connection with nearly all the important expositions of the past quar- 
ter of a century and his exhaustive studies of all the principal museums 
of Europe and the United States gave him exceptional opportunities 
for observation and experiment. Though a young man when he died, 
none other had acquired so ripe an experience and none is more worthy 
of being followed. 

An incidental, though very popular, educational feature of the 
Museum, having for its purpose the promotion of scientific teaching 
throughout the country, has been the distribution to schools and col- 
leges of its duplicate specimens, properly identified and labeled, and 
put up in carefully selected sets. Inadequate means have prevented 
this measure from being carried out on the scale which the resources 
of the Museum would admit of, but many hundreds of such sets have 
already been given away. 

Scarcely a year passes that some exposition, either at home or 
abroad, is not occupying the attention of the Museum, and through 
this means its existence and aims are brought constantly and promi- 
nently before the public. These expositions have of late followed one 
another so closely, and have required such extensive preparations, as 
to interfere greatly with the ordinary work of the Museum, but the 
practice of introducing new and varied features, of showing a fresh 
series of objects or improved groupings in connection with each one, 
insures a substantial gain, when the collections are returned to Wash- 
ington, besides fulfilling the important function of making museum 
methods known to the people of the United States and stimulating 
the growth of museums in many quarters. 

Though mainly technical and most useful to the investigator, the 
publications of the Museum can be classed, in a general way. as 
belonging to its educational side, being the medium through which 
the nature and extent of its collections are made known. The Annual 
Report, first printed as a separate volume of the Smithsonian Report 
in 1884, and now in its twentieth volume, consists, besides the admin- 
istrative part, mainly of semipopular papers on interesting portions of 



12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

the collections. The Proceedings and Bulletins are almost exclusively 
technical, the shorter papers being - assigned to the former and the 
larger and more exhaustive works to the latter. Of the Proceedings 
tweifty-four complete volumes have been issued, and of the Bulletins 
fifty-two numbers. 

THE NEW MUSEUM BUILDING. 

As stated in the last report, Congress, in its session of 1903, had 
authorized the erection of an additional building for the National 
Museum at a cost not to exceed $3,500,000, and tin 1 Board of Regents 
had appointed a committee to have charge of this important work. 
The superintendent of construction, Mr. Bernard K. Green, had been 
designated in the act of Congress, and the architects, Messrs. Horn- 
blower & Marshall, who prepared the tentative sketches, had been 
selected by the Regents. 

By the close of that year the architects had begun upon the elabora- 
tion of their plans, a work of slow progress, since the building is not 
for an object with which that profession, in an} T part of the world, has 
had much to do. There is no fixed pattern to follow, but it is hoped to 
correct some of the faults shown in buildings heretofore put up for 
the same purpose; to correct them all is beyond expectation. It has 
been the task of the Museum expert to explain his needs; it is now for 
the architect to express them in a definite and practical form. It is 
expected that this work will be satisfactorily accomplished, and a 
building produced meeting the requirements of science and the arts, 
as well as those proposed for architectural improvement at the national 
capital. 

It is still too early to discuss the details of the plans. It may oe 
said, however, that the building will be effective in appearance, sub- 
stantial, and fireproof. It will have an abundance of light and be 
well ventilated and well heated. The reserve collections and the labor- 
atories of each division will be in relatively close proximit}^ to the 
corresponding exhibition collections, insuring convenience of study 
and oversight. Several elevators will connect the different stories, 
and the comfort of visitors will be fully providedfor. Congress has 
called for plans for a central power and heating plant for the buildings 
on the Mall. The benefits of such a feature can not fail to be appre- 
ciated, but as some dela} T must occur in carrying out this measure, it 
is expected that the new Museum building will need to have its own 
separate plant installed in the basement to meet at least its preliminary 
wants. 

By the beginning of the calendar year 1904 the plans had been suffi- 
ciently advanced to fix definitely the main lines, the general dimensions, 
and the architectural design, though requiring still further study to 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 13 

harmonize the parts and perfect the many details. At this stage they 
were, on January i!T. approved by the Secretary of the Smithsonian 
Institution, with the advice and consent of the Chancellor of the Insti- 
tution and the chairman of the executive committee, as provided by 
the resolution of the Board of Regents. About this time also the 
expert personal services of Prof. S. Homer Woodbridge, of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, were engaged to plan the 
mechanical equipment of the building, including the apparatus for its 
heating, ventilation, and electric lighting. 

The excavation for the building, the contract for which had been 
awarded to the Cranford Paving Company, of Washington, was begun 
on June 15, li»(»4. The lateness of the season precluded the holding of a 
formal ceremom T on that occasion, but the first spadeful of earth Mas 
turned by Secretary Langlev in the presence of the superintendent of 
construction, the architects, and the employees of the Museum and 
Institution. Addressing the superintendent, Mr. Green, the Secretary, 
remarked: 

On behalf of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, with the consent of the 
chancellor and of the chairman of the executive committee, I now authorize you, 
in accordance with the act of Congress, to proceed with the construction of the new 
building for the United States National Museum, designed to increase and diffuse the 
knowledge of the arts and sciences among the people. 

The site of the building was also inclosed with a' high board fence 
and a small frame structure was erected as the headquarters of super- 
intendence. Immediately following the excavation, sometime during 
the summer, the work of building the foundations will be begun. 

GROWTH AND NEEDS OF THE MUSEUM. 

On preceding pages a brief history and a summary of the objects of 
the National Museum have been given. Becoming a prominent fea- 
ture in the early programme of the Institution, the course of the 
Museum ran smoothly as long as there was room for its development. 
Its scope, defined by the organizing act of Congress, was as compre- 
hensive as the sphere of human knowledge in so far as could be com- 
passed by Museum methods. In the beginning its collections were 
practically all of natural history. Then appeared ethnology and 
archeology, and finally the arts and industries as exemplified in the 
work of modern man. In fact, the Museum building proper was 
intended mainly for the last-named subjects. So rapid, however, has 
been the growth of the collections that some confusion has resulted in 
their arrangement, and their appearance at present is no criterion of 
the wealth of the Museum or of its scope and anticipations. The 
.Museum has back of it all the Government surveys, whether at home 
or abroad — a guaranty of the value of at least a largo proportion of its 



14 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

acquisitions. It has many friends, some the owners of large and 
important collections, who have come to recognize that in an institu- 
tion founded by the Government for all time their specimens will be 
not only perpetually and securely cared for, but also at the service of 
every specialist who needs to consult them. Officials of the Govern- 
ment detailed for duty in the new possessions, rich in novelties of 
nature and of culture, are giving thought to the wants of their National 
Museum. By means of the duplicates, set aside as collections are 
worked over, exchanges are made with other museums, whereby 
important additions are obtained. The exhibition collections in some 
branches, notably the historical, owe many of their most attractive 
features to loans. These are not the property of the Museum and may 
only remain in its possession for short periods; but the spirit of liber- 
ality in this direction, long manifested, is growing steadily, until of 
late it has sometimes been necessary to decline important deposits on 
account of lack of room. This difficulty will be overcome upon the 
completion of the new building, whose greater accommodations and 
improved facilities will, it is hoped, prove an additional incentive to 
the possessors of collections, large or small, which may be instructive 
to the people. 

In appropriating for the large expositions, of which many have 
been held in recent }^ears, there has been a general understanding on 
the part of Congress that from the allotment to the National Museum 
the Museum shall gain something of permanent value. By judicious 
management, though the amounts have been small, the Museum has 
secured many unique specimens which it could not have obtained in 
any other way at its command. With several of the larger museums, 
which are well supplied with funds, it is customary to send out 
exploring expeditions even to distant regions, and some of these 
investigations are conducted on a very extensive scale. They are an 
important source of collections as well as of information, but the 
National Museum has neither the funds nor a sufficiently large staff 
to engage in such work except on a very small scale, generally in 
connection with one or other of the Government surveying expedi- 
tions, and with the object of obtaining material which these surveys 
do not collect. 

There is one method of obtaining collections in which the National 
Museum has been weak, while by such means all of the larger 
museums of the world, whether national, municipal, or private, have 
acquired a large proportion of their treasures. This is in the direct 
expenditure of money for purchases. The importance of this method 
is not realized by Congress, though it might be, were the matter 
given thorough consideration and were the proper relations of the 
Museum to those bureaus of the Government which are charged by 
Congress with the investigation of agricultural, mining, fishery, and 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 15 

other like problems, better understood. The specimens resulting 
from all Government surveys and investigations are transferred to the 
National Museum as soon as the studies upon them are completed. 
The Museum is, therefore, the depository for all Government collec- 
tions. Those who wish to consult them, whether in the Government 
employ or strangers to it, must come to the Museum. It is, there- 
fore, to be concluded that the National Museum is not a passive bod}-, 
but one most actively concerned in the development of the welfare of 
the country. Yet, in a general way, the investigators of practical 
problems for the Government find here only what they themselves 
have collected. They need more complete series of objects in order 
that their studies may be more complete, and at least for the benetit 
of the industries of the country the gaps in the series should be filled 
up as opportunity offers. An expert set to work upon a problem of 
far-reaching economic importance requires to have before him all the 
material possible, that nothing bearing upon his subject shall escape his 
observation. It is the province of a large central museum to possess 
these extended collections, classified and arranged so that they may at 
all times be accessible. 

The curio shop of old has given way to the modern museum, with 
its definite purpose based upon experience and the advance of knowl- 
edge during many years. While the purpose may vary in accordance 
with the character and advantages of a museum, none can doubt that 
it should be the primary object of a great national museum like the 
one at Washington to subserve the needs of the Government, to do a 
large part toward promoting the material interests of the people. 

It is in this spirit and with these objects in view that appropriations 
are asked for the purchase of such specimens as can not be acquired 
in other ways. To approach perfection in the rounding out of collec- 
tions is in itself naturally very gratifying, but to do this for the pur- 
pose of benefiting the practical investigations of the Government is 
the chief aim of the National Museum. Private collectors and students 
have spent their lives in bringing together special collections which 
are often far more perfect than can be obtained through the means sup- 
plied by the Government, and rare and unique objects of exceeding- 
value fall into the hands of individuals. The National Museum should 
have the means of acquiring such of these as are required for the pur- 
poses of the Government, and all this with the understanding that 
the Museum is only a part of the system organized by the Government 
for improving the condition of its people. 

The collections are separated into practically two series, the so-called 
reserve or working series being arranged for the convenience of inves- 
tigators, while for the instruction and entertainment of the public 
ample provision is made here as elsewhere, much more room, in fact, 
having been allotted to this than to other purposes. There is. of 



16 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

course, a limit beyond which any display becomes bewildering and 
tiresome, but that point lias not yet been reached in this Museum. 
The exhibition collections comprise selections from all the branches 
represented, and only enough from each to serve the desired purpose. 
In some branches, however, like history, nearly all the material objects 
are appropriate for exhibition, and find their most appreciative critics 
among the general public. In other branches, moreover, there are 
many large objects which can best be cared for in the exhibition halls, 
and are, therefore, nearly always seen there. 

A third division of the collections, one prepared for general teachers 
and young students, as suggested by Dr. F. A. Bather, of the British 
Museum, might readily be arranged when additional room becomes 
available, but there is less need for such in this country than seems to 
be the case abroad, since nearly all the schools and colleges throughout 
the United States have their own collections, especially of natural 
history, supplied in part from the duplicates in the national collections. 

It will thus be seen that the collections which come to the National 
Museum are being utilized to the fullest extent and in a most liberal 
manner. The reserve series, comprising the specimens which have 
already been worked up and are held as records of past investigations, 
together with those which still remain to be studied, constitute the 
technically important part of the Museum, and alone justify its exist- 
ence. The public collections, however, take the greatest amount of 
space, require the largest expenditure of money, and demand the 
most ingenuity in their selection and arrangement. There remain 
the duplicates, only known to be such as the work of classification 
proceeds, which serve the double purpose of securing valuable returns 
through exchange and of promoting education by their gratuitous 
distribution to schools and colleges. The amount of material used 
for the latter purpose since this practice was established over half a 
century ago, has been very great. 

The greatest discrepancy to-day in the administration of the Museum 
results, however, from an insufficient staff, not as regards efficiency 
but numbers. Only one who has had to do with the management of 
such a large trust can fully appreciate tin" significance of this state- 
ment, and those clothed with power to correct this condition have not 
yet come to thoroughly understand the importance of the matter. 
The responsibilities in administering upon a national museum of this 
great and free country are probably much heavier than those in any 
other land. The policy recognized in every branch of the Govern- 
ment of the United States, and sanctioned by Congress, is to d<> 
for the people whatever is possible. This Government is doing for its 
people what no other government has ventured to attempt, and the 
result is a condition of extreme prosperity and contentment. And 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 17 

is no share of credit for this condition to be given to the National 
Museum? It plays an important part in this great programme of 
which it is supremely proud, and while Congress may not yet fully 
realize what it accomplishes in this respect, the public does, and 
demands more than it can perform. 

For the conduct of its technical work the Museum is able to employ 
less than 35 persons of all grades. Nearly as many more employees 
of the Government give as much of their time as can he spared in the 
interest of the classification of the collections and their supervision. 
For the proper installation and maintenance of the exhibition collec- 
tions, in which Congress places much store, further skilled help is 
required, and a supervision which has long been inadequate. The 
force of watchmen employed for the safety of the collections, both by 
day and night, would be scarcely equal to the task of protecting, under 
the same circumstances, even the contents of a large jewelry store. 
The Museum contains objects whose intrinsic value mounts into the 
hundreds of thousands of dollars, many of which are so small that 
several could be carried away in a man's pocket. In a jewelry estab- 
lishment the valuables are packed away each evening in large safes. 
Such a course is impossible in the Museum, owing to the number of 
its treasures. They must be left in the cases, and }et the appropria- 
tions permit of so small a force of watchmen that they are kept under 
great and constant strain to prevent the abstraction of what could 
never be replaced. 

Beginning years ago Congress, in the interest of their. constituents, 
looked to the Museum for the anal} T sis of mining products and for the 
identification of objects of every kind. These demands have increased 
rapidly, and their satisfaction has alwa}s been regarded as within the 
legitimate province of the Museum. The fact, however, is not appre- 
ciated that work of this character requires the attention of trained 
experts, and the time of the scientific staff is largely occupied in 
complying with such requests. In preparing the letters of repby, in 
registering the specimens received, in cataloguing, in taking down 
the notes of investigators, in arranging and keeping track of the 
collections, a comparatively large intelligent clerical force is required. 
In the preparation of duplicate collections, in the shipping and receiv- 
ing room, in the library, in the making of cases and the installation of 
specimens, in the keeping clean of all the large halls, there must be 
help, and at the minimum this is no small item. 

The U. S. National Museum is like no other museum in this country, 
and it has no parallel in the world. Elsewhere, with few exceptions, 
museums exist solely for what may be termed museum purposes. They 
promote science and they promote the arts. Many are powerful factors 
in education and in the improvement of industries. The l\ 8. National

18 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Museum attempts to do the same within the limits of its scope, but it has 
an added function in that it shares a part of the executive work of the 
Government. The correspondence with members of Congress and with 
the Executive Departments is very large, but not nearly as extensive 
as that with the public, and all is supposed to relate to business on which 
the Museum only is in a position to furnish information. The fre- 
quent expositions also greatly increase the burden of work, for, though 
special appropriations are made for them, it is necessary to call upon 
the skilled employees of the Museum to a large extent. This means 
that a proportionately larger force is required than in museums gener- 
ally, and the increase is as necessary outside as within the scientific 
staff. 

It is not to be expected that a complete staff will ever be within the 
means of the Museum — that is to say, a staff sufficient to do especially 
all the classificatory work required. Such a staff rftis nowhere been 
assembled. In a proper organization, however, there should be an 
adequate number of experts, some at least of the highest rank, to con- 
trol and supervise the several subjects represented. In this respect 
the National Museum is now far below the standard. The members 
of its staff, while acting as custodians of the collections, should be 
competent to assist extensively in their classification, should appre- 
ciate their value and significance, and should have the faculty of 
keeping order, so that any specimen in their care can readily be found. 

The classification of collections must always be largely done by out- 
siders, the result of the specialization of study, and this is the course 
now almost universally pursued as a matter of necessity when large 
collections are being worked up. In accordance with this plan, the 
National Museum has now many experts at work on special parts of 
its collections, most of them- connected with institutions in the United 
States, but some abroad. In this way the collections are being classi- 
fied in the most accurate manner possible. When they are returned 
to Washington they need the same oversight as before, but their 
value has been enhanced by the fact that the specimens are no longer 
an uncertain quantity. 

Other parts of the business of the Museum can not be carried on in 
the same way — the administration, the correspondence, the care of 
the collections and their installation for reference or exhibition, the 
watch service, the skilled help in the mechanical departments and in 
the preparation of specimens, and the labor required to keep the 
buildings clean, to do the moving and lifting and to assist in every 
branch of work — the workers in these directions can not be omitted 
from the staff, nor can their labor be performed by volunteer assistance. 

Among other important needs of the Museum are means for main 
taming its library on a better basis. The library is purely technical, 
having no other use than to provide for the working up of the collec- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 19 

tions, but the small annual appropriation given for this purpose is 
inadequate even to provide the current literature on the necessary 
subjects, though the freest use be made of the Library of Congress. 

There is still another subject to which it is desirable that reference 
should be made — the extension of the hours of opening the buildings 
to the public so as to include Sundays and evenings. A change in this 
direction would be of inestimable value to the working people as well 
as to visitors to the capital, and the extra expense would be small. 

The writer desires to call attention in this connection to the part 
now being taken by the Museum, in conjunction with the parent insti- 
tution and its other bureaus, at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. 
The Museum has had a long experience in matters of this kind, begin- 
ning with Philadelphia in 1876, and it is therefore to be expected that 
some improvement would be shown at each succeeding exposition. 
The display at the St. Louis Fair now in progress is more noteworthy 
than anything that has preceded it, both in the novelty of the objects 
exhibited and in the perfection and attractiveness of the installation, 
which have already elicited much praise- 



SUMMARY OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE 

YEAR. 



APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPENDITURES. 

The total amount appropriated by Congress for the maintenance of 
the National Museum during the year ending- June 30, li»04, was 
$269,400, as against $281,400 for the previous year. The decrease 
was due to the omission of the appropriation of $7,000 for publishing 
the " Contributions from the U. S. National Herbarium," and to the 
fact that there was no necessity for renewing- the item of $5,000 
appropriated the previous year for the preparation of preliminary 
plans for an additional Museum building. A special appropriation of 
$250,000 was made as the first installment of the cost of this building. 

The expenditures up to the close of the year from the appropria- 
tions for 1903-4 amounted to $254,286.59, leaving a balance of $15,118.41 
to meet outstanding liabilities. During the same year $22,479.50 
were disbursed from the balance of $23,408.14 of the appropriation 
for 1902-3, on hand July 1, 1903. 

The following tallies show the expenditures during the year 1903-04, 
under each item of appropriation:

Disbursements from the appropriation for 1901-02 were made as 
follows: Preservation of collections, $100.52; books, pamphlets, and 
periodicals, $165.89; purchase of specimens, $20, leaving balances of 
$58.61, $32.88, and $35.26, respectively. These balances, together 
with unexpended balances of the appropriation for furniture and 
fixtures, heating and lighting, building repairs, construction of gal- 
leries and rent of workshops, amounting to $161.13, have reverted to 
the surplus fund of the Treasury. 

The regular appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1905, 
are as follows: 

Furniture and fixtures $22, 500 

Heating and lighting 18,000 

Preservation of collections 1 .SO, 000

Building repairs 15, 000 

Rent of workshops 4, 580 

Postage 500 

Printing and binding 25, 000 

Total 267, 580 

It will be observed that the item for printing and binding has been 
increased from $17,000 to $25,000, and that for rent of workshops 
from $1,100 to $1,580; while the appropriation of $10, 000 for the 
purchase of specimens has been omitted. With these exceptions the 
appropriations are the same as for the fiscal year 1904. 



BUILDINGS. 



The progress made toward the construction of an additional building 
for the National Museum has been described in a previous part of this 
report. The architects' plans had advanced so far that actual work 
upon the site was possible by June 15, 1901, on which date the excava- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 23 

tion of the ground was started. The building of the foundations will 
follow next, and should be completed before winter. 

The very unsatisfactory condition of the roof of the present Museum 
building- has been repeatedly referred to, and attention has also been 
called to the fact that any repairs which can now be made will be 
essentially temporary, since the supporting iron framework over the 
main halls lacks sufficient strength, and the slate covering can not be 
made entirely tight, whereby leaks occur where least expected, damag- 
ing the walls and at times even defacing the cases. The difficulty with the 
slate results largely from the contraction and expansion of the frame- 
work, due to changes in temperature, and heavy falls of snow have also 
caused parts of the iron structure to buckle. 

The faulty character of the roof is undoubtedly due to the cheap 
manner in which it was originally constructed. The only remedy 
seems to be the substitution of a new roof, at least over the large halls, 
courts, and rotunda. Such an extensive repair is impracticable at this 
time, or until the new building is finished, as there is no place in 
which the collections could be stored. In the meantime, however, with 
the aid of experts, strong efforts are being made to render the roofs 
effective for a few years longer without the necessity for constant and 
unavailing attention. The work was started during last year and will 
be continued during the present one. 

The area of tin rooting around the rotunda and over the eight 
ranges, which had greatly deteriorated, was thoroughly repaired, 
all imperfect tin being replaced and many seams resoldered. The 
rotunda roof was extended down over the old top gutters and new 
overhanging gutters, and down spouts were added. The slate roof 
over the east hall was. as an experiment, covered with a coating of 
Bermuda asphalt, burlap, and slag, intended to till the interspaces 
between the slates and to present an unbroken surface for carrying off 
the water. Up to the time of writing, this expedient seems to have 
answered its purpose well, and should it continue to do so, the other 
slate roofs will be treated in tin same way. The work about the roof 
has also included repairs to the skylights and to clear-story and rotunda 
windows, the insertion of ventilator frames in many of these, and the 
addition of skylights over two of the ranges, made necessary by the 
construction of galleries. 

The dilapidated platform in front of the main entrance has been 
replaced with one of mosaic, consisting of large irregular marble frag- 
ments, and the steps and side coping have been reset. 

The repairs in the interior of the Museum building have been chiefly 
of a minor character, though in the aggregate extensive. They have 
related mainly to the floors and to the walls and ceilings. The sten- 
ciling of the rotunda walls, which had been deferred until the roof of 



24 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

this part of the building had been made more secure, was also in prog- 
ress at the close of the year. 

Many persistent leaks about the roof of the Smithsonian building, 
which previous repairs had not corrected, were found to be mainly 
due to the imperfect condition of the old tin gutters and down spouts, 
which were repiired during the year, copper being generally substi- 
tuted where a renewal of material was necessary. 

Reference has been made in earlier reports to the unsafe condition 
of the plastering in Archeological Hall, which began to show innumer- 
able large cracks several years ago. At times small pieces of the 
plaster would fall, but in September, 1902, several such large masses 
gave way from the ceiling as to damage the cases underneath and 
emphasize the fact that the hall should be closed to the public. It was 
only during the past year that the damage could be repaired, and this 
necessitated a very considerable undertaking. The entire area of 
plaster was carefully tested and all loose parts were removed. The 
bare places were carefully pointed up, but the plaster cornices of the 
large central panels were replaced by others of galvanized iron, as 
being the cheaper method. Subsequently the room was painted in 
water color, the walls green, the ceiling in light tints of green to ivory. 
This extensive repair greatly disturbed the arrangement of the arche- 
ological collections, and a considerable period will be required for the 
renovation of the cases and the reinstallation of their contents. 

The number of cases made during the } r ear was 212, the number of 
specimen drawers 3,378, these having been chiefly required for the 
storage and arrangement of collections received from Government sur- 
veys. A large part of the work done under the head of "Furniture 
and fixtures," however, has consisted in the repair and renovation of 
cases; the making and inserting of fittings in the exhibition cases, 
including the shelving and their supports, and the tablets and other 
devices on which the specimens are mounted; the more extensive 
supports for the mounting of large exhibits, such as recent and fossil 
vertebrates and ethnological and archeological objects; the making of 
label-holders and the painting of large labels and signs for the cases 
and halls, and the construction of laboratory and office furniture. 

Rearrangements in certain parts of the building have necessitated a 
few readjustments of the electric-light wiring, and there have been 
some minor extensions of this system into storerooms and laboratories 
not previously so provided. A small ' electric motor has also been 
installed in the geological workshops in the Emery building. 

The high-pressure steam boilers placed in the Museum building in 
the summer of 1901 have continued to give satisfaction. From this 
source both of the large buildings, as well as the several smaller ones 
adjacent, are now heated. There has been the usual amount of repairs 
in connection with the heating apparatus, and it has been found neces- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 25 

sary to increa.se the number of radiators in some of the halls. Steam 
was first raised in the boilers on October 10, 1903, and. with sonic 
interruptions, continued to be maintained until May 3, 1904. 

The tire apparatus was thoroughly overhauled during- the year and 
its condition greatly improved. Some of the extinguishers of old pat- 
tern were replaced by others of more recent make and more effective 
character. 

The amount of labor involved in maintaining the cleanliness of the 
buildings can scarcely be appreciated except by those who have the 
matter in charge. Twenty-two exhibition halls, mostly of large size 
and many containing galleries, and 89 laboratories, office rooms, toilet 
rooms, etc.. require to be swept and dusted every morning, and, for 
the most part, before 9 o'clock. In this enumeration is not included 
the outside buildings. The number of regular laborers and cleaners 
amounts to only 22, and these same men are also fully occupied 
throughout the day on other matters. The number of exhibition 
cases of which the glass has to be kept clean and the woodwork free 
from dust is over 1,300. 

ADDITIONS TO THE COLLECTIONS. 

The National Museum, as the legally constituted depository for the 
science and art collections of the Government, has as its most constant 
and important sources of supply the national surveys and explorations, 
such as are conducted by the Geological Survey, the Bureau of Fish- 
eries, the Biological Survey and Bureaus of Entomology and Plant In- 
dustry of the Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of American 
Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution. But these are not the only 
Government branches which conduct explorations. The Departments 
of War and of the Navy sent out many important expeditions during 
the early and middle part of the last century, and in connection with the 
recent acquisition of new territory they have again furnished the oppor- 
tunity for securing valuable collections. Interesting objects are also 
sent home from time to time by members of the consular service of 
the State Department. A large part of the additions to the Museum 
are, however, received from individuals and private establishments, 
through donation and exchange, and the exhibition series derives 
many of its attractive features from loans or deposits. Field collect- 
ing by members of the Museum staff is almost prohibited by the 
scarcity of funds, and the acquisition of specimens by purchase is 
seriously restricted because of the small appropriation for that purpose. 

Appendix II of this report contains a complete list of the accessions 
for the year, and the more noteworthy are described in the reports of 
the head curators. 

The number of separate lots of material received during the year 
was 1,703, as against 1,613 in 1903, aggregating about 241,527 speci- 



26 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

mens and thereby increasing the total number of specimens recorded 
in all of the departments to approximately 5,898,493. Of these, nearly 
4,200,000 belong to the Department of Biology, about 975,000 to 
Anthropology, and about 730,000 to Geology. 

The additions in anthropology during L904 numbered H>,121 speci- 
mens, of which the more important were many carefully selected 
objects obtained by Dr. W. L. Abbott among the natives of the 
Malay Peninsula, northern Sumatra, and the Mentawei Archipelago. 
These, in conjunction with the previous generous contributions of 
Doctor Abbott from the same and other parts of southern Asia, con- 
stitute an exceedingly valuable and unique feature of the ethnological 
collections, and are now being used as the basis for a monographic 
report by Professor Mason and Doctor Hough.. The same explorer 
also sent material bearing upon the physical characteristics of the 
Moros, and of apes and monkeys. 

Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. Arm}-, who has continued his scientific 
work while on duty in the Philippine Islands, presented an especially 
interesting collection made by him personally during a campaign 
against the Moros of Mindanao. It is rich in weapons, basketry, and 
fine brass work. Another Moro collection, received as a loan from 
Dr. R. B. Grubbs, also of the United States Army, consists of edged 
weapons, spears, armor, costumes, and other specimens of the handi- 
work of those people. Several native Philippine Island firearms were 
presented by the President of the United States. 

Two totem poles and four house posts of large size and excellent 
workmanship, taken from a Tlinkit village, were obtained through 
Dr. George A. Dorsey, of the Field Columbian Museum, and a valu- 
able lot of art objects from southwestern Alaska, consisting of carved 
clubs, embroidered blankets, figures, knives, etc., through Lieut. G. T. 
Emmons, U. S. Navy. Some important additions were made to the 
already large collections of Indian basketry, musical instruments, and 
folklore. 

The large archeological collection which had belonged to the late 
Dr. Thomas Wilson, curator of prehistoric archeology, and which 
remained on deposit in the Museum during his lifetime, was purchased 
during the year. It consists of over 19,000 pieces, of which somewhat 
under two-thirds are of European origin, the remainder being from 
North America. The European material covers a wide range, begin- 
ning with the roughl} r shaped Hint implements of the river gravels of 
England and France, and ending with the more highly elaborated 
objects of the polished stone and bronze ages. The American speci- 
mens are mainly from Virginia, Tennessee, and Arkansas. 

The very valuable collection of archeological objects obtained in 
Porto Rico, Trinidad, Grenada, Barbados, Dominica, Cuba, and other

West Indian islands, during the winter of 1903, by Dr. J. Walter 
Fewkes, of the Bureau of American Ethnology, has been transferred 
to the keeping of the Museum. It contains a great variety of objects, 
some of the most noteworthy being especially tine examples of stone 
collars, tripointed stone zemes, earthenware bowls, carved stone faces, 
amulets, etc., all of which were secured in the course of a thoroughly 
systematic investigation of the island region between North and South 
America. The same Bureau also deposited a large series of stone and 
bone implements, pieces of pottery and woven work, and fragments 
of animal and human bones, collected by Mr. E. H. Jacobs in caverns, 
rock shelters, and village sites in the Ozark region of Missouri and 
Arkansas. 

By bequest of the late Mr. I. H. Harris, of Waynesville, Ohio, 
there was obtained a large and varied collection of stone implements, 
with some shell beads and carvings and a few copper implements and 
ornaments, mainly from the Miami Valley of Ohio, and of typical 
earthenware vessels from mounds near (Jharlestown, Missouri. Mr. 
H. W. Seton-Karr, of England, presented an unusually interesting- 
series of Egyptian stone implements, mainly of a t}^pe peculiar to the 
desert of the Fayum district, about 10 miles from the present limits 
of cultivation. From Mr. Felix F. Outes were secured several earth- 
enware vessels taken from aboriginal graves in the province of Cata- 
marca, Argentina. 

A number of casts of Assyro-Babylonian, Egyptian, and Grseco- 
Roman sculptures were obtained by purchase, and several others by 
donation from the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. In this collection is 
a stela engraved with the code of laws of the Babylonian King, Ham- 
murabi. A series of heliogravures of Hellenistic portraits was pre- 
sented by Mr. Theodor Graf, of Vienna, Austria; and knives and Hint 
implements from the Temple of Osiris, Abydos, were received from 
the Egyptian Exploration Fund. 

To the recently established Division of Physical Anthropology there 
were added more than 2,000 crania and skeletons by transfer from the 
Army Medical Museum, 14 crania of Wasco Indians from the Fred. 
Harvey collection, and other desirable specimens. 

The additions to the historical collections included a valuable series 
of relics presented to the Smithsonian Institution by Gen. John Watts 
de Peyster, who has also made several large contributions of important 
historical works; the gilt dress sword presented to Gen. Jacob Brown 
by the State of New York, for services during the war of 1812, donated 
by his grandson, Mr. Nathan Brown Chase; the sword and epaulets 
worn by Gen. Alex. McComb, U. S. Army, deposited by Mrs. F. C. 
d'Hautville; a fine oil painting of ( ieorge Catlin by W. H. Fisk, li. A., 
lent by his daughter, Mrs. Louise Catlin Kinney, and now hung in 



28 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

the midst of the famous Catlin collection of Indian portraits, and 
numerous relics deposited by the National Society of the Daughters 
of the American Revolution. 

The technological exhibits have been materially increased, among 
the accessions of special and to a great extent also of historical interest 
being a collection of rifles, muskets, and other firearms, 615 in num- 
ber, showing the improvements of many years and containing several 
noteworthy pieces, deposited b} T the Bureau of Ordnance of the War 
Department; a collection of sporting rifles of the kinds used in this 
country prior to about 1850, accompanied by powderhorns, etc., lent 
by Mr. Herman Hollerith; a finely finished .44-caliber rifle made by 
Henry Deringer, of Philadelphia, and often used by David Crockett 
in target practice, lent b} T Col. Wright Rives; a rare form of flintlock 
pistol with folding bayonet, presented by Mr. Paul Beckwith; a col- 
lection of Morse telegraph keys, insulators, and other electrical appa- 
ratus in use about 1850, presented by the Pennsylvania Railroad 
Company; a telegraph switch invented in 1855 by E. W. Culgan, of 
Pittsburg, and generally employed down to 1865, donated by Mr. 
C. S. Greer, of Zanesville, Ohio, and a collection illustrating the 
development of the hand camera, contributed by the Eastman Kodak 
Company. 

The accessions to the Department of Biology embraced 151,273 
specimens, or nearly 11,0(>0 more than the previous year. The col- 
lection of insects was increased by 58,953 specimens and the herba- 
rium by 13,800, the remaining 18,520 specimens being divided among 
the other divisions. 

The most extensive of the zoological additions in point of number 
of specimens consisted of about 40,000 insects collected in British 
Columbia by Dr. Harrison G. Dyar, assisted by Mr. R. P. Currie and 
Mr. A. X. Caudell. The Bureau of Fisheries transmitted large col- 
lections of land and fresh-water shells, reptiles, and crustaceans from 
Indiana and other States; a valuable series of marine mollusks, chiefly 
from Alaska; the types of recently described fishes from Japan, the 
Hawaiian Islands, etc.; fishes, crustaceans, and corals secured in con- 
nection with the Alaskan Salmon Fisheries Investigation of 1903, and 
461 plants from Alaska and Oregon. 

Especially worthy of mention are important zoological contributions 
from the Mentawei Archipelago, eastern Sumatra, and the various 
islands off that coast, obtained and presented by Dr. William L. 
Abbott. Thirty 7 -one new forms of mammals, including one new genus 
and two new species of gibbon and several new species of birds, are 
represented in the collection from the archipelago, while that from 
eastern Sumatra also contains very valuable material, among which 
are numerous forms of birds and reptiles not previously represented 
in the Museum. Several valuable lots of mammals, birds, and mol- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 29 

lusks from Minnesota and the Philippine Islands were donated by 
Dr. E. A. Mearns, V. S. Army. A large number of mammals, birds, 
reptiles, and fishes from the Bahama Islands were secured as the result 
of the expedition sent out by the Baltimore Geographical Society, and 
of which Mr. B. A. Bean and Mr. J. H. Riley, of the Museum staff, 
were members. A valuable collection of birds' eggs and reptiles from 
Texas was transmitted by the Biological Survey of the Department of 
Agriculture. Other miscellaneous lots consisted of birds, land shells. 
and insects from the mountains of Venezuela, and of bats and birds 
from Barbuda and Antigua islands. 

Noteworthy among the mammals received were a specimen of a 
remarkable species of bat, Euderma maculatum, presented by Mr. 
E. O. Wooton, of Mesilla Park, New Mexico; the first authentic 
specimen of a jaguar from the United States; a rare mouse-deer, 
Tragulm stanleyanus, obtained from M. Emile Deschamps; a collec- 
tion of Old World mammals, from Mr. W. Schli'iter; a collection of 
Japanese mammals, from Mr. T. Tsuchida; some rare forms of bats 
from the British Museum; a collection of Colombian mammals from 
the American Museum of Natural History, and a number of bats 
from Cuba, the gift of Capt. Wirt Robinson, U. S. Army. 

An interesting series of birds of the Philippine Islands was secured 
by exchange with the museum in Manila. Mr. Homer Davenport, of 
Hast Orange, New Jersey, donated a number of young pheasants, and 
Mr. N. C. Brown, of Portland. Maine, a well-prepared series of birds 
from South Carolina. Four species of birds-of-paradise, new to the 
collection, were purchased. Dr. W. L. Ralph, of the Museum staff, 
and Gen. J. W. Barlow made generous contributions to the collection 
of birds 1 eggs, and series of rare Mexican eggs and of the eggs of the 
hoactzin were purchased. 

A collection of Japanese reptiles was presented by Dr. Hugh M. 
Smith, Deputy Commissioner of Fisheries, and some rare reptiles of 
southern Florida by Mr. E. J. Brown, of Lemon City, Florida. The 
Division of Fishes has received a large number of Japanese species 
from the Leland Stanford Junior University, and a well -prepared 
series of specimens from Puget Sound, donated by Dr. J. C. Thomp- 
son, U. S. Navy. A specimen of the Japanese shark, Tlfztsukitria 
owstoni, 11 feet long, was purchased. 

Hawaiian land shells and other invertebrates were received from 
Mr. H. W. Henshaw, of Hilo, Hawaii; Dr. II. E. C. Stearns, associate 
in zoology, now residing in Los Angeles, California, presented an 
extensive series of west American shells, and Mr. H. N. Lowe and 
Mrs. Blanche Trask several lots of Californian shells. Mr. E. J. 
Court, of Washington City, donated a representative series of the 
land shells of Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia; Mr. 
D wight Blaney, about 300 shells dredged near Mount Desert. Maine, 



30 KEPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

and Mr. C. A. Davis, many Bermuda shells, including several cotypes. 
Among the specimens obtained by purchase was a large collection of 
Japanese land and marine mollusks, and land shells from the Pacific 
coast and the islands off California. Rev. L. T, Chamberlain presented 
a small collection of rare river mussels. 

The division of marine invertebrates received a collection of Mex- 
ican fresh-water crabs from the Biological Survey of the Department 
of Agriculture; crustaceans from Catalina and San Clemente islands. 
presented by Mr. H. N. Lowe; cotypes of a species of shrimp and of 
a stomatopod crustacean from the National Museum of Brazil; several 
beautiful specimens of four species of Japanese precious coral, from 
Dr. K. Kishinouye, and a collection of sea urchins, chiefly from the 
Gulf of Siam, from the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen. 

The additions to the division of insects were numerous and valu- 
able. Among those of greatest importance, next to the one already 
mentioned, may be noted two lots of over 6,000 specimens from the 
Department of Agriculture; an extensive collection of Coleoptera, 
Lepidoptera, etc., made by Mr. K. A. Schwarz in Cuba; several lots of 
Philippine insects from Rev. W. A. Stanton, of Manila, and one from 
Mr. R. C. McGregor, of the Philippine Museum; a miscellaneous 
collection from the grounds of the Washington Biologists 1 Field Club 
at Plummers Island; a valuable collection of Lepidoptera, from Mr. 
E. M. Anderson, of the Provincial Museum at Victoria. British Colum- 
bia, and a large collection from Colorado and New Mexico from Prof. 
T. D. A. Cockerell. From foreign sources the following collections 
were received as gifts: Indian Hymenoptera from Maj. C. G. Nurse; 
Indian spiders from Prof. N. Jambunathan; Venezuelan beetles from 
Mr. Edward A. Klages; Peruvian insects from Mr. M. J. Pusey; 
Norwegian Lepidoptera from Sir George Hampson, of the British 
Museum, and Japanese Hymenoptera from Prof. S. Matsumura. of 
Sapporo. 

Of 555 accessions to the division of plants, the most valuable was 
the deposit made by Dr. E. L. Greene of his very valuable collection 
of about 60,000 sheets of plants and his entire botanical library, con- 
sisting of about 3,000 volumes and pamphlets. Next in importance 
was the gift by Mrs. T. A. Williams, of Memphis, Nebraska, of about 
15,000 specimens from various parts of the United States. Mr. C. V. 
Piper, of Pullman, Washington, presented 658 plants from that State, 
and Mr. E. W. D. Hoi way, of Minneapolis, Minnesota, an interesting 
collection of Mexican plants. Important exchanges were made Avith 
the Philippine Bureau of Agriculture, the New York Botanical Gar- 
den, and the Royal Gardens at Kew, England. Sixty-eight botanical 
accessions were received from the Department of Agriculture, the 
most important comprising specimens obtained in Texas by Mr. Arthur 
Howell, in New Mexico and Oklahoma by Mr. Fred G. Pluinmer. and 



KEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 31 

in Now Mexico by Mr. Vernon Bailey. Plants from Australia. Mexico, 
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and from several of the States were acquired 
by purchase. 

There were 690 accessions to the Department of Geolog} r , the most 
extensive coming, as usual, from the U. S. Geological Survey. Promi- 
nentamong them were about 40,000 invertebrate fossils, mostly named, 
and including a large amount of material on which Dr. William 11. 
Dall and his assistants have been working for several years. The 
Survey also transmitted a series of 1,932 tertiary insects, assembled 
by Dr. Samuel H. Scudder, but in large part still unworked, together 
with many hundred original drawings, a great part of which are 
unpublished. The acquisition of these specimens is believed to make 
the Museum collection of fossil insects the largest in the United 
States, if not in the world. 

To the division of physical and chemical geology there were added 
a collection of platiniferous rocks from the Demidoff mines of Russia, 
presented by Mr. Juarez Sponville; a series of rocks illustrating the 
occurrence and association of diamonds at the De, Beers Consolidated 
Mines, Kimberly, South Africa, donated by Mr. Gardner F. Williams, 
manager of the mines; a beautiful nugget of native silver, from Mr. 
A. L. Pellegrin, of Nogales, Arizona; a specimen of diamond-bearing 
gravel from Minas Geraes, Brazil, to which a small diamond was 
attached, from Dr. O. A. Derby, of Sao Paulo, aiid a tine mass of 
amethystine quartz, weighing about 400 pounds, taken from the ex- 
traordinary geode discovered a few years ago in Rio Grande do Sul, 
Brazil. 

The division of minerals was enriched by a large collection illus- 
trating the occurrence and association of zeolites and siliceous minerals 
in the trap rocks of New Jersey, obtained through the assistance of 
Dr. W. S. Disbrow, of Newark, New Jersey, who also transmitted 
one of the first known crystals of American spodumene obtained in 
the early part of the nineteenth century. Other important gifts 
were a specimen of pink spodumene used as gem material, from Mr. 
F. M. Sickler; a series of artificial stones used in the gem trade, from 
Mr. Oscar T. Jonassohn; a cut turquoise from North Carolina, from 
Mr. Eugene A. Smith, and some fine specimens of smoky quartz from 
Montana, from Messrs. A. P. Pohndorf and J. R. Wharton. 

For the meteorite collection specimens illustrating the Trenzano 
fall, the Franceville, Missouri, iron, the Mukerop. South Africa, iron, 
and the Finnmarken pallasite were acquired. 

Of invertebrate fossils, the accession next in importance to those 
transferred by the U. S. Geological Survey was the last portion of the 
E. O. Ulrich collection, containing about 15,000 specimens, including 
500 lots of original types or of specimens that have been used for illus- 
tration. A series of Lower Silurian fossils, selected by Mr. Charles

Schuchert while in Russia, was presented by the Imperial Acadenry 
of Sciences of St. Petersburg, through the cooperation of Dr. Fred- 
erich von Schmidt, and a valuable donation consisting of nearly 600 
specimens of Hamilton brachiopods was received from the Yale 
University Museum. By exchange with the Zoological Museum of 
the University of Copenhagen more than a hundred specimens of 
identified European mesozoic and tertiary bryozoans were obtained. 

To the collection of fossil vertebrates were added tine specimens of 
pterodactyl, ichthyosaurus, and teleosaurus; some fishes from the 
lithographic limestone, and a fossil skull of Bison alleni from a placer 
deposit of frozen gravel, 25 feet below the surface. The object last 
mentioned is especially noteworth} T as being the first specimen of the 
species discovered in Alaska. It was secured through the efforts of 
Gen. Timothy E. Wilcox, U. S. A. (retired), and was presented to the 
Museum by Mr. Donald McLean, of Rampart City. Alaska. 

One hundred and thirty-two fossil plants, collected from the higher 
beds of the anthracite series, were donated by Mr. C. W. Unger, of 
Pottsville, Pennsylvania, and 190 specimens of fossil plants from Illi- 
nois, Ohio, and other localities, forming part of the Carl Rominger 
collection, were also obtained.

GENERAL WORK UPON THE COLLECTIONS. 

The primary work of the Museum statf is the care and preservation 
of the collections. With the large accessions constantly received, this 
is also the most important and the most onerous of all the duties 

NAT MUS 1904 3 



34 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM. 1904. 

devolving- upon the employees. So diverse and so full of detail is this 
branch of administration that it would be quite impossible to discuss 
the subject adequately in this connection, but some idea of its extent 
and complexities may be obtained from the reports of the head 
curators. 

The packages as received have to be unpacked and their contents 
assorted in accordance with the departments or divisions to which the 
specimens belong. A complete record of each accession is made and 
retained in the office of registration. In the various divisions to which 
the} 7 are then transferred the specimens are labeled, numbered, and 
catalogued serially, after which they are arranged in cases or in stor- 
age, their safety and convenience of reference being presumably 
secured by these several acts. Unless they come identified they may 
be named at once, but the work of classification goes on slowly for 
the most part, and years sometimes elapse before a collection can be 
thorough^ identified and described, as noted under the head of 
" Researches." 

As a part of general museum work may be included the duties of 
the preparatory in preparing, poisoning, and mounting specimens; in 
extracting fossils from their matrix, in cutting rock specimens to a 
convenient size, and making thin sections to show their structure; in 
modeling and arranging lay-figure groups, and in many other directions. 

In the Department of Anthropology, where the objects average 
larger than in other departments, there has long been greater need 
for the use of outside storage, but during the year considerable inside 
storage has been gained by the building of racks and shelves back of 
exhibition cases. This has afforded some relief, and permitted the 
overhauling and improvement of the reserve collection. Through 
cooperation with the Bureau of American Ethnology, the work of 
photographing, singly or in groups, the members of Indian delega- 
tions, which have lately been numerous, has been so increased as to 
greatly enlarge the tine portrait series of American natives started 
several years ago. 

The Department of Anthropology has two preparators' laboratories, 
one for the making of models of objects of various classes, mostly 
ethnologic, for filling out the Museum series of exhibits and for 
exchange purposes, the other concerned with the making of replicas 
of Museum specimens in plaster. During the year 45 models were 
completed in the former, while in the latter an exceptionally large 
amount of work was accomplished, the regular preparators being 
assisted by two other skilled workmen especially employed in con- 
nection with the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. Molds of 120 of 
the most important archeological objects in the National Museum 
were made, and from these several sets of casts were obtained, 
one, properly colored, being installed with the Museum's exhibit at 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 35 

St. Louis, the others held for exchange. These replicas are executed 
with the utmost care, and one set has been photographed along with 
the originals for distribution to the museums with which exchanges 
are arranged. The same force of preparators also built models of a 
number of the ruined buildings of Mexico and Yucatan, five of these 
being completed and exhibited at St. Louis. In the same laboratory 
there were also made during the year twenty masks, besides other 
castings of Indians belonging to delegations which visited Washington 
during the season, and from these castings a number of busts have 
been prepared, both for the Museum and for exchange. 

In the several divisions of the Department of Biology not only has 
the material obtained during the year received the attention required 
to insure its safety, but much has also been done toward improving 
the condition of older parts of the collections. The staff is, however, 
altogether too small to handle these large collections satisfactorily, 
and the limited storage and laboratory quarters prevent that arrange- 
ment of specimens which would make them readily accessible for 
reference or study. The latter difficulty is soon to be overcome, and 
it is hoped that the former also may. In the division of mammals 
6,760 skulls were cleaned, a necessary preliminary to the study of the 
specimens of this group. A large number of skins were made over, 
and some additional cases for the arrangement of the reserve series 
were provided. The entire collection of mammals is now in as good 
condition as the means will allow, but very much remains to be done. 
No special improvement is to be noted in the condition, of the bird 
collection, as the space allotted to it has long been overcrowded. The 
identification, labeling, and cataloguing of specimens has continued. 
In a general way the same may be said of the other biological divi- 
sions, but it should be recognized that in all the preservation of 
specimens has been as carefully looked after as the circumstances 
permit, and practically everywhere their condition is good. The 
mollusks, to which much attention has been given, are mostly labeled 
and accessible. The collection of insects, one of the largest and most 
valuable in the world, was never so well preserved and arranged as it 
is at present, rapid progress having been made in the transfer of 
specimens to the new hermetically-closing drawers. Much of the 
work with this group is being performed by volunteers, members of 
the entomological section of the Department of Agriculture, whose 
assistance is to the advantage of both bureaus. The condition of the 
varied collections in the division of marine invertebrates was greatly 
improved, a large amount of cataloguing having been done, and many 
sets of duplicates put up for distribution. The helminthological col- 
lections, considered to be the finest in the country for study purposes, 
has been maintained in good condition. 



36 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

In the division of plants much activity has prevailed. Eighty -six 
insect-proof cases were installed, increasing the entire number of this 
kind to 341, all of which have been found to answer their purpose 
perfectty. These additions and changes in furniture, which afford 
secure storage for a very large proportion of the collection, have 
necessitated an extended rearrangement of specimens, which is still in 
progress. The number of specimens mounted during the year was 
29,700; of sheets stamped and recorded, 21,000. 

The collections generally in the Department of Geology are reported 
to be in a fairly satisfactory condition, and not less than 100,000 speci- 
mens have been put away in final Museum shape, but large accessions 
have rendered it impossible to keep the numbering, complete labeling, 
and cataloguing of material up to date. The working out of fossil 
vertebrates from the rocks in which they are embedded has received 
continued attention, but the progress in this direction has been neces- 
sarily slow, and it is evident that the staff of preparators must be 
increased if prompt results are desired. The entire lithological study 
series has been overhauled and catalogued in card form, and upward of 
300 thin rock sections have been made. Card catalogues of the entire 
mineralogical and of other geological collections are in course of prep- 
aration, and an annotated list of the types belonging to the Depart- 
ment of Geology, several thousand in number, is also under way. 

The preparation of 500 duplicate sets of fossil invertebrates, in 
which not less than 60,000 specimens will be used for distribution to 
educational establishments in the United States, was nearing comple- 
tion at the close of the j 7 ear. 

THE EXHIBITION COLLECTIONS. 

In the Department of Anthropology a few cases have been added in 
the northwest court gallery for an exhibit of Indian baskets, this sub- 
ject having gained special prominence through the publication of Prof. 
O. T. Mason's recent paper on "Aboriginal American Basketiy." The 
series of lamps, illustrating the development of means of illumination, 
has also been extended. A beginning has been made toward illustrat- 
ing the ethnology of the Philippines, in which has been utilized the 
collection recently obtained by Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, on the 
island of Mindanao, and the ethnolog} 7 of Malaysia through the import- 
ant contributions of Dr. W. L.. Abbott. The collection of musical 
instruments, now. one of the most important in the world, has been 
partly reinstalled. A typical series of muskets, rifles, and carbines, 
mostly deposited by the War Department, and three tabic cases of 
revolvers and pistols of various makes and dates, have been arranged 
in the east hall. 

A new mahogany case has been provided for the original Francis 
life-saving car, an object of deep interest to all visitors, and in auothe?" 
suitable case has been installed the cylinder of the Hornblower engine.

the first steam engine set up on the Western Continent, having been 
imported from England in 1753 for pumping water from the copper 
mines of Col. John Schuyler, Belleville, New Jersey. A very useful 
addition to the time-keeping series consists of two clocks from the 
Chelsea Clock Company, of Boston, which have been connected with 
the service of the U. S. Naval Observatory. Interesting historical 
relics deposited by the Society of the Daughters of the American 
Revolution have been added to the cases assigned to that society. 

Several groups of ethnological lay figures returned from recent 
expositions have been installed wherever a place could be found for 
them, some having been arranged in the lecture hall. 

With a view to unifying the work of installation in the Department 
of Biology, this entire subject was placed in charge of Mr. F. A. Lucas, 
the curator of comparative anatomy. But little was done toward 
preparing new exhibits in this department, however, owing to the 
arrangements in progress for the St. Louis Exposition. Some of the 
more valuable birds were remounted, and four groups of game birds 
were installed in two new special cases at the entrance to the Smith- 
sonian building. Additional casts of fishes for the series in the south- 
east range of the Museum building are being prepared, and a beginning 
has been made toward the installation of a series of specimens illus- 
trating the mollusk fauna of the District of Columbia, one such case 
having alreadj^ been completed. The installation of the systematic 
series of insects has been nearly finished. 

A series of illustrations of corals and coral reefs from Saville Kent's 
work on the Great Barrier Coral Reef of Australia has been framed 
and placed with the exhibition of corals in the west hall of the Smith- 
sonian building. Many specimens in the different exhibition collec- 
tions have been renewed, and there is a generally improved appearance 
in nearly all the exhibits of this Department. 

To the display collection in the Department of Geology have been 
added skulls of JJiplodocus, Trac/todon, and of two genera of Cerat<>j>- 
sia, one being the type of Triceratops caMcwviis and the other repre- 
senting a new genus of the dinosaurs. The mounted skeleton of a 
specimen of Syornis casuarinus from New Zealand has also been 
installed. 

A noteworthy addition to the exhibits in geology is a geological sec- 
tion on a scale of 2 miles to the inch across the United States from the 
coast of North Carolina to a point near San Franeisco. This model 
has been the work of two years. The specimens in all other divisions 
of this department have been more or less overhauled during the 
year, especially in the lithological and mineralogical series, and 
improvements have been made in the exhibit of invertebrate fossils, 
but lack of room prevents any noteworthy additions to or expansion 
of these collections. 



38 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

RESEARCHES. 

Of the material which reaches the Museum a part has previously 
been studied and a part not. The act founding the establishment 
provides that the collections shall be arranged and classified, and there- 
fore in selecting the care-takers, persons skilled in the various branches 
represented are chosen. It is recognized that their first obligation is 
to look out for the safety of the specimens, and as the technical staff 
under pay is relatively small, attention to this dut} T consumes the 
greater part of their time. About one-half of this staff consists of 
volunteers employed in other bureaus of the Government on whom 
the same demands can not be made, though some of these are equally 
attentive to the routine work. The scientific results accomplished 
each }^ear by the paid employees of the Museum is, nevertheless, 
relatively extensive, comprising mainly the identification, labeling, 
and descriptions of specimens, and their classified arrangement in 
cases and drawers so as to make them convenient for reference. 

For a large part of the scientific work, however, assistance must be 
obtained from experts connected with other establishments throughout 
the United States and in Europe. Entire groups of specimens may 
be assigned to individuals for study, or advantage taken of researches 
in progress elsewhere to have material of greater or less extent iden- 
tified, and visiting scientific men are often willing to spend some time 
upon such parts of the collections as come within their knowledge. 

It is impossible within the limits of this report to account for all 
the work of this character carried on during the past year, but the 
number of persons concerned, not including those on the Museum 
staff, was in the neighborhood of 200, and over 20,000 specimens were 
sent away for study. This cooperation is far greatest in connection 
with the Department of Biology, whose varied collections have long- 
attracted a widespread interest and have led to many extensive and 
important investigations. 

In the Department of Anthropolog} 7 considerable progress was made 
by the Head Curator and his assistants in studying the ethnological 
collections sent to the Museum during the past ten years by Dr. Wil- 
liam L. Abbott from the southern part of Asia and its adjacent islands. 
Mr. William H. Holmes has continued his work of monographing the 
mines and quarries of the American aborigines. Dr. A. F. Hrdlicka 
conducted extensive researches in different branches of physical anthro- 
pology. Further investigations in the subjects of primitive heating, 
illumination, cooking devices, etc., have been carried on by Dr. Walter 
Hough. Mr. Paul Beckwith has begun the preparation of a descrip- 
tive catalogue of the Grant relics in the National Museum and a 
catalogue of ancient coins. The collection of swords has also been 
catalogued. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 39 

Mr. George C. Maynard has given much time toward unraveling 
the history of the old locomotive Stourbridge Lion, and has also been 
engaged on a history of firearms. 

The collections of the Department of Anthropology have been 
examined by many persons, some of whom have made important stud- 
ies for official and other purposes. Among these investigators umy 
mentioned the Statistician of the United States Bureau of Immigration; 
Prof. C. S. Sherrington, of University College, Liverpool, England; 
Miss Voorhees, of Indiana, who examined the prehistoric European 
collections; Miss Marie Ruef Hofer, of Teachers 1 College, Columbia 
University, New York; Mr. John P. S. Neligh, Columbus, Georgia, 
who is interested in the study of Indian textile art; Mrs. J. Wells 
Champney, who is gathering information regarding the Abenaki tribe; 
Judge James Wickersham, of Eagle City, Alaska, who is investigating 
the industries and social customs of the Indians of that region; Mr. 
Ole Solberg, of Christiania, Norway, who is making studies in prepara- 
tion for an investigation of the social customs of the Hopi Indians; 
Lieut. W. E. W. McKinlay, U. S. Army, detailed by the Division of 
Military Information to obtain data to assist in compiling grammars 
and dictionaries of some of the Philippine languages; Mr. Stewart 
Culin, Curator of Ethnology in the Brooklyn Institute, to whom speci- 
mens were also lent for the purpose of reporting upon Indian games 
for the Bureau of American Ethnology; Dr. H. M. Whelpley, of St. 
Louis, Missouri, who studied material for a paper on catlinite pipes, 
and Mr. E. A. Forward, of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 
who is interested in the history of the Stourbridge Lion already 
referred to. 

In connection with the Department of Biology research work was 
extensively carried on both b} r members of the Museum staff and br- 
others. Dr. F. W. True, the Head Curator, completed his important 
monograph on the whalebone whales of the western North Atlantic, 
which will appear in Volume xxxni of the Smithsonian Contribu- 
tions to Knowledge, and he also published four shorter papers on ceta- 
ceans. Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, jr., assistant curator of mammals, has 
continued his studies on Dr. William L. Abbott's large collection of 
mammals from the Malay Archipelago, having finished one paper on 
the subject during the year, descriptive of 70 new species, including 1 
new genus and (3 new species of monkeys, 2 new species of mouse deer, 
and 6 new species of fl} T ing lemurs. He also prepared several smaller 
papers and continued work on a new classification of the bats. Dr. 
Marcus W. Lyon, jr., aid in mammals, completed a revision of the 
hares and their allies, based upon a detailed study of their anatomical 
and other characters. 

Among those who had access to the mammal collections or to whom 
specimens were sent for examination were Dr. J. A. Allen, of the 



40 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

American Museum of Natural History; Mr. J. A. G. Rehn, of the 
Philadelphia Academy of Sciences; Dr. I). G. Elliot, of the Field 
Columbian Museum; Mr. Outran) Bangs, of the Museum of Com- 
parative Zoology; Prof. Burt G. Wilder, of Cornell University, and 
the* members of the Biological Survey of the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture. 

Mr. Robert Kidgway, curator of birds, continued with little inter- 
ruption the preparation of his comprehensive monograph on the Birds 
of North and Middle America, completing the manuscript f c c Volume 
in, and a large part of that for Volume iv, beside two small papers 
on new genera and species of birds. In making the measurements of 
specimens for his monograph he was assisted by Mr. J. H. Riley, aid, 
who also published three notes on birds from the Bahama Islands. 
Dr. Charles W. Richmond, assistant curator of birds, finished the 
identification of the majority of the birds collected by Dr. W. L. 
Abbott on the islands off the western coast of Sumatra, prepared a list 
of the species obtained by Doctor Abbott and Mr. C. B. Kloss on 
Anambas and Tambelans islands, China Sea, and at Tringana, Malay 
Archipelago, and was the author of several notes on zoological 
nomenclature. 

The collection of birds was consulted by Dr. R. M. Strong and Prof. 
C. O. Whitman, of the University of Chicago; Mr. Elliot Blackwelder, 
of Chicago; Mr. Jonathan Dwight, jr., of New York; Mr. Outram 
Bangs; Mr. Frank Chapman, of the American Museum of Natural 
History; the Biological Survey, and the Committee on Nomenclature 
of the American Ornithologists 1 Union. 

Studies on the reptile fauna of eastern Asia were carried on by Dr. 
Leonhard Stejneger, curator of reptiles, who also worked up the collec- 
tion of reptiles brought from Japan by Dr. Hugh M. Smith, Deputy 
Commissioner of Fisheries, and from the Bahamas by Mr. J. H. Riley, 
as a member of the expedition of the Baltimore Geographical Society. 
Doctor Stejneger likewise prepared a general account of the herpetol- 
ogy of the Bahama Islands and several small papers, and, in conjunc- 
tion with Mr. Vernon Bailey, identified the Museum collection of 
reptiles from Texas. His report on the proceedings of the Fifth Inter- 
national Zoological Congress at Berlin, during August, 1901, at which 
he represented the National Museum, was received during the year. 
Facilities were afforded Prof. W. P. Hay, of Howard University, for 
studying the diamond back-terrapin for the Bureau of Fisheries. 

Mr. Barton A. Bean, assistant curator of fishes, reported on the 
fishes collected on the expedition of the Baltimore Geographical Soci- 
ety to the Bahama Islands, comprising 165 species, identified the 
specimens obtained by the Senff Expedition to the Nile in 1899, and pre- 
pared notes on material from North Carolina and the Barbados. The 
collections in this division were also consulted by Dr. Theodore Gill, 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 41 

an associate of the Museum; Dr. David S. Jordan and Dr. C. II. Gil- 
bert, of Leland Stanford Junior University; Dr. C. II. Eigenmann, of 
Indiana University, and the scientific start' of the U. S. Bureau of 
Fisheries. 

Among - the results accomplished by Dr. William II. Dall, honorary 
curator of mollusks, may be noted reviews of the nomenclature of the 
Pupacea, and of the history and classification of the Tritons and Trog- 
shells, a summary of the recent and fossil land shells of the Bahama 
Islands, and a number of other papers, some prepared in conjunction 
with Mr. Paul Bartsch, aid in mollusks. He also began upon a general 
review of the land and fresh-water mollusks of Alaska and adjacent 
regions. Mr. Bartsch continued work on the family Pyramidellida 1 , 
and published descriptions of new species of Scissurella and Sonorella, 
a note on Limax, and an account of the herons living in the District of 
Columbia. The- Pacific coast Pectinidse were studied by Mr. Ralph 
Arnold, of the United States Geological Survey, and the recent and 
fossil Pleurotomida? by Col. Thomas L. Casey, U. S. Army. The 
collection of Achatinellas was sent to Prof. Alpheus Hyatt, of the 
Boston Society of Natural History, and after his death was turned 
over to Dr. A. G. Mayer, of the Brooklyn Institute, who is to complete 
his investigation of this group. 

The statf of the division of insects, including its honorary members, 
has to its credit a total of 114 papers published during the year, but 
not nearly all of these related to Museum material or were issued b\ T 
the Museum. The authors were Dr. L. O. Howard, honorary cura- 
tor; Dr. W. H. Ashmead, assistant curator; Dr. H. G. Dyar, Mr. D. 
W. Coquillett. and Mr. Nathan Banks, custodians, Mr. R. P. Currie, aid, 
and Mr. A. N. Caudell. Doctor Ashmead continued his work on the 
classification of the Hymenoptera and has published his generic revision 
of the entire order except the ants, or superfamily Formicoidea, which 
will probably soon be completed. He has also worked up all the 
Japanese and Philippine Hymenoptera now in the Museum, and papers 
on this subject will shortly appear in the Proceedings of the Museum. 
His most important paper of the year was a classification of the Chalcid 
flies. Among the thirty-one papers prepared by Doctor Dyar, the 
most noteworthy was one of 160 pages on the Lepidoptera of the 
Kootenai district of British Columbia. Mr. Coquillett's researches 
related mainly to the diptera, and those of Mr. Banks to the spiders. 

Studies were made as follows by visitors to the Museum: On the 
Lepidoptera, by Prof. J. B. Smith, of Rutger's College, Dr. J. W. 
Holland, of the Carnegie Museum, Mr. W. D. Kearfott, of New York, 
and Mr. William Schaus, of London; on the Arachnidae by Mr. J. H. 
Emerton, of Boston, and Prof. R. V. Chamberlain, of Cornell Uni- 
versity; on the Coleoptera by Mr. C. Schaeffer, of Brooklyn, Dr. 
Henry Skinner, of Philadelphia, and others. Several physicians have 



42 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

examined the collection of mosquito larvae, and the Carnegie Institu- 
tion has had the use of the specimens of Polisies, a genus of social or 
paper-making wasps. The number of loans of specimens was large, 
the principal being of Coleoptera to Dr. F. E. Blaisdell, San Francisco, 
California; of Orthoptera to Mr. J. A. G. Rehn, of the Philadelphia 
Academy of Sciences; of Rhynchota to Prof. P. R. Uhler, of Baltimore; 
and of Diptera to Prof. James S. Hine, of the Ohio State University. 

Dr. James E. Benedict, assistant curator of marine invertebrates, 
continued his studies on the anomouran crustaceans, two papers, a 
revision of the genus Lepidopa, and descriptions of new albuneids, 
being published during the year. Miss M. J. Rath bun, assistant cura- 
tor, completed the monograph of the fresh-water crabs (Potamonida?) 
on which she has been engaged for some time, and which is being 
printed in the Archives of the Paris Museum of Natural History. 
She also continued work on the crabs of Hawaii, preparing a paper on 
this subject for the U. S. Bureau of Fisheries, and one on the decapod 
crustaceans of the northwest coast of North America for the Harriman 
Alaska expedition. Dr. Harriejt Richardson, collaborator in marine 
invertebrates, also finished a report, published in the same series, on 
the isopod crustaceans of the northwest coast, besides an account of the 
isopods obtained on the Alaskan expedition of the Bureau of Fisheries 
in 1903. She has since begun upon a manual of the North Ameri- 
can Isopoda. Mr. T. Way land Vaughan, custodian of madreporarian 
corals, has made notable progress in the study of that group as repre- 
sented in the Museum, haying paid special attention to the collections 
from the Hawaiian islands. Dr. C. W. Stiles, custodian of the 
helminthological collections, completed his investigation of the hook- 
worm disease in the Southern States, and began upon a study of 
"spotted fever" in Montana. 

A number of specialists connected with other institutions are 
engaged in working up several groups of marine invertebrates as fol- 
lows: Prof. Charles L. Edwards, of Trinity College, Hartford, Connect- 
icut, the pedate holothurians; Prof. Hubert Lyman Clark, of Olivet 
College, Michigan, the apodal holothurians; Prof. C. C. Nutting, of the 
University of Iowa, the hydroids, of which reports on the Plumulari- 
dse and Sertularidae have been published; Dr. Charles B. Wilson, of 
the State Normal School, Westfield, Massachusetts, the parasitic cope- 
pods; Dr. K. W. Gent-he, of Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut, 
the free swimming copepods; Dr. R. W. Sharpe, of Wilmette, Illi- 
nois, the Ostracoda; Dr. W. T. Caiman, of the British Museum of 
Natural History, the cuniacea; Dr. H. Coutiere, Ecole Superieure de 
Pharmacie, Paris, the Alpheidse. Besides material supplied to the 
above, specimens from the collections made during the investigations 
of 1903 by the Bureau of Fisheries into the Alaskan salmon fishery 
and elsewhere have been sent out as follows: The parasitic copepods

Cambridge, Massachusetts; the Schizopoda t<> Dr. A. K. Qrtniann, of 
the Carnegie Museum; the Amphipoda to Dr. .1. S. Holmes, of the 
University of Michigan; and the Cirripedia to Prof. H. A. Pilsbury, 
of the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences. A large numberof Bering 
Sea and arctic starfishes have been supplied to Prof. A. E. Verrill, of 
Yale University, for examination in connection with a report on the 
starfishes of the Harriman Alaska Expedition: several lots of actinians 
to Dr. J. E. Duerden. of the University of Michigan, who i- prepar- 
ing- a report on the Hawaiian species for the Bureau of Fisheries; and 
specimens of echini and isopods to Dr. T. H. Mortensen and Dr. 
H. J. Nansen, respectively, of the Zoological Museum of Copenhagen, 
Denmark. 

Mr. F. A'. Coville. curator of the division of plants, has published 
several papers which are cited in Appendix III. Dr. J. N. Rose, 
assistant curator, has continued his studies on Mexican and Central 
American plants. He has also, in conjunction with Dr. X. L. Britton, 
director of the New York Botanical Garden, conducted investigations 
relative to the North American Crassulacese and has begun to work up 
the cacti of North America, a research which is expected to occupy 
four or five years. A preliminary paper on the Crassulaeese and one 
by Doctor Rose on a new species of Begonia have appeared during the 
year. Mr. W. K. Maxon, aid. has given special attention to the speci- 
mens of ferns received from the Philippine Islands, and Mr. E. S. 
Steele, to the genus Laciniaria. Dr. E. L. Greene, appointed associate 
in botany near the close of the year, has engaged in various lines of 
systematic work. The Carices have been the subject of study by Mr. 
Theodor Holm, of Brookland, District of Columbia, and the speci- 
mens of the genus Plantago by Prof. E. L. Morris, of the Washing- 
ton High School. The collections have been frequently consulted 
by several members of the botanical staff of the Department of 
Agriculture. 

There were 43 loans of plants, aggregating 2,873 specimens, the prin- 
cipal ones being as follows: A large collection from the Philippine 
Islands to Dr. Janet Perkins. Berlin Botanical Gardens; a collection of 
Mexican plants to Dr. B. L. Robinson, of the Gray Herbarium. Har- 
vard University: specimens of pines to Mr. George R. Shaw, of the 
Arnold Arboretum.^Jamaica Plains, Massachusetts; and specimens of 
orchids to Mr. Oakes Ames, of the Ames Botanical Laboratory. North 
Easton, Massachusetts. 

The Head Curator of Geology. Doctor Merrill, has supervised the 
work of an economic survey relating to the building and ornamental 
stones of North Carolina, and as an expert special agent of the last 
census has completed a report on stone quarries. A collection id" rocks 
brought from the Nugsuaks Peninsula, Greenland, and the occurrence 



44 KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1004. 

of unakite near Milams Gap, Virginia, have been described by Mr. 
William C. Phalen, while many rare minerals and a meteorite from 
Persimmon Creek. North Carolina, have been the subject of study by 
Mi\ Wirt Tassin. Researches on the Rochester shale bryozoa have 
been continued by Mr. K. S. Bassler, and two papers on Paleozoic 
bryozoa have been completed by Mr. E. O. Ulrich in conjunction with 
Mr. Bassler. An account of all the Middle Devonian crinoids in the 
Museum collections has been prepared by Miss Elvira Wood, of the 
U. S. Geological Survey. 

Material from the collection of vertebrate paleontology has been 
utilized by Prof. H. F. Osborn, of the American Museum of Natural 
History, in his work on the Titanotherium; by Mr. J. B. Hatcher, of 
the Carnegie Museum, in his study of Triceratops, and by Mr. F. A. 
Lucas, of the National Museum, in connection with his researches on 
Stegosaurus. Besides the investigations carried on by the paleo- 
botanists of the U. S. Geological Survey, some studies have been 
made on the fossil plants by Dr. Arthur Hollick, of the New York 
Botanical Garden; the Rev. H. Herzer, of Marietta, Ohio; and Mr. E. 
W. Berry, of Passaic, New Jersey. Dr. Thomas L. Watkins, of 
Denison University, Ohio, has made use of the collections in applied 
geology.

technic Institute; Mr. S. F. Emmons, of the U. S. Geological Survey, 
and Mr. Frank Springer and Dr. H. N. Stokes, of the U. S. Bureau 
of Standards. 

EXPLORATIONS. 

But few explorations were carried on last year by members of the 
Museum staff. Dr. Walter Hough spent some time in Arizona and 
New Mexico, where he made a large collection of ethnological and 
archeological objects. Botanical field work was carried on in Mexico 
by Dr. J. N. Rose, and in Jamaica by Mr. W. R. Maxon. The expe- 
dition sent to the Bahamas during the summer of 1903 by the Balti- 
more Geographical Societ}^ and Johns Hopkins University, under the 
direction of Dr. G. B. Shattuck, was accompanied by Mr. Barton A. 
Bean and Mr. J. H. Riley, who took an active part in the work of col- 
lecting and observation. Dr. Harrison G. Dyar and Mr. Rolla P. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 45 

Currie were members of a party sent to British Columbia by the Car- 
negie Museum, of Pittsburg, and returned with large collections of 
insects. During a trip to Europe Mr. Charles Schuchert secured 
some valuable fossils, and, while seeking material for the Louisiana 
Purchase Exposition, Dr. George P. Merrill obtained for the Museum 
many geological specimens on the Pacific coast and in Canada and 
western Mexico. 

Having been designated by the State Department and the Smith- 
sonian Institution as delegates to the International Congress of 
Zoology to be held at Berne, Switzerland, during the summer of 1904, 
Dr. Leonhard Stejneger and Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, jr., left Wash- 
ington in May, with the object also of making collections of mammals 
and reptiles in Europe, and of identifying unclassified material by 
comparison with specimens in certain European museums. A num- 
ber of short collecting trips were also made by other members of 
the staff. 

There have been many explorations by private individuals and by 
other Government bureaus through which the Museum has profited. 
A few of these maj r be noted. Dr. William L. Abbott has continued 
his field work in Sumatra, the Mentawei Archipelago, and along the 
coast and on the islands east of Sumatra, and, as usual, has contributed 
his specimens to the National Museum. In connection with the inves- 
tigations of the Bureau of Fisheries. Dr. Hugh M. "Smith has visited 
Japan, and Dr. B. W. Evermann, Prof. Charles IT. Gilbert, and 
Prof. O. P. Jenkins have made extensive explorations in Hawaii. 
The natural history bureaus of the Department of Agriculture, and 
especially the Biological Survey, have made important collections in 
different parts of the United States. Field work under the Bureau of 
American Ethnology, productive of collections, has been carried on 
b} r Dr. J. Walter Fewkes in the West Indies, and by Mr. James 
Mooney, Mr. Gerard Fowke, Mrs. M. C. Stevenson, and Mr. J. R. 
Swanton in the West. Reference should also be made to the impor- 
tant work conducted in the Philippine Islands by Dr. E. A. Mearns, 
U. S. Army, one of the most frequent contributors to the Museum 
collections. 

Collecting outfits were supplied to the following persons outside of 
the Museum staff: Mr. Vinal N. Edwards, Woods Hole, Massachu- 
setts; Mr. L. H. Ayme, New York City; Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, Bureau 
of American Ethnology; Dr. Frank Baker, National Zoological Park;

DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGE OE SPECIMENS. 

In the distribution of duplicate material to educational establish- 
ments throughout the country a total of 20,010 specimens was used. 
These contributions, chiefly to schools and colleges, were comprised 
in 148 separate lots or sets of objects accurately labeled and adapted 
for teaching purposes. They consisted of 55 sets of marine inverte- 
brates, 35 of fishes, 10 of geological material illustrating rock weath- 
ering and soil formation, -4 of casts of prehistoric stone implements, 
and 44 of a special and miscellaneous character. 

In making exchanges, for which an equivalent is obtained for incor- 
poration in the national collections, 216 lots, aggregating 9,005 speci- 
mens, were disposed of. The number of specimens lent to specialists 
for study amounted to 20,535, comprised in 115 separate sendings. 

Among the more important exchanges received from establishments 
abroad were the following: From the British Museum of Natural His- 
tory, London, England, a number of alcoholic bats; from the Royal 
Botanic Gardens, Kew, England, a large collection of plants from

VISITORS. 

The Museum building was visited during the year by 220,778 per- 
sons, and the Smithsonian building by 143,988 persons, a daily aver- 
age of 705 for the former and 460 for the latter. The decrease as 
compared with the previous year is accounted for by the meeting of 
the Grand Army of the Republic in October, 1902, during which 
month alone the attendance amounted to 131,448. 

The following tables show, respectively, the attendance during each 
month of the past year, and for each year beginning with 1881, when 
the Museum building was first opened to the public.

MEETINGS AND LECTURES. 



During- the first half of the year the lecture hall was utilized for the 
preparation and packing of a part of the exhibits for the Louisiana 
Purchase Exposition. After January 1, 1904, however, it was fre- 
quently used for its legitimate purposes. 

A series of Saturday afternoon lectures, under the auspices of the 
Biological Society of Washington, was given as follows: 

February 20, Exploration of the Deep Sea, by Mr. Charles H. Town- 
send; February 27, The Living Forest, by Mr. Gitford Pinchot; 
March 5, A Naturalist's Winter in Mexico, by Mr. E. W. Nelson; 
March 12, The Evolution of the Horse, by Prof. Henry F. Osborn; 
March 19, The Coast Region of Alaska, by Dr. C. Hart Merriam. 

The attendance at these lectures varied from 898 to 1,213 persons — 
far more than the seating capacity of the hall. 

The closing exercises of the U. S. Naval Medical School were held 
here on March 21, and those of the U. S. Army Medical School on 
April 5. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 49 

The American Oriental Society occupied the hall for its annual meet- 
ing on April 7 and 8, and the National Academy of Sciences from 
April 19 to 21, the latter also being- given the use of the rooms of the 
Assistant Secretary for its business sessions. 

A lecture entitled "Botanical tramps with a camera." illustrated hj 
stereopticon views, was delivered on June 13, by Dr. C. E. Waters, of 
Johns Hopkins University, under the auspices of the Wild Flower 
Preservation Society of America. 

CORRESPONDENCE. 

The Museum, ever since its establishment, has been looked upon by 
the general public as the most convenient agency for obtaining- infor- 
mation on all subjects within its scope, and scientific men and scientific 
institutions throughout the country turn to it for aid and advice. All 
requests of this character, made in evident good faith, have prompt 
attention, but the work involved, steadily increasing year by year, 
has become especially heavy and exacting, and consumes much of the 
time of both the scientific and the clerical stall's. The requests average 
several daily, are rarely confined to a single subject, and often relate 
to collections of greater or less size which are sent for identification. 
They also have reference, in many instances, to the building up and 
maintenance of collections, the construction of cases, the installation, 
labeling, and cataloguing of specimens, and other topics connected 
with museum administration. The replies made to such inquiries 
during the past year fill about 6,000 pages in the letter-press books, 
this being entirely apart from the ordinary official correspondence of 
the Museum, which alone is very extensive. 

The correspondence office also has charge of the distribution of 
publications, the number of which sent out during the year amounted 
to about 18,000 volumes and 39,000 separate papers. 

PUBLICATIONS. 

A greater number of publications than usual was issued during the 
year, owing partly to delays in completing volumes belonging to the 
previous year. They comprised the annual reports of the Museum 
for 1901 and 1902; volumes 25, 26, and 27 of the Proceedings; and 
Part II of Special Bulletin No. 4. entitled ••American Hydroids," 
being a monograph of the family Sertularidse by Prof. Charles ( '. 
Nutting, of the University of Iowa. The last named is a quarto vol- 
ume of 325 pages and 41 plates, the result of a painstaking and impor- 
tant investigation of collections belonging to this Museum. 

The annual report for L901 was received from the Printing Office 
on October tl, 1903; that for 1902 on March 12, 1904. The former 

NAT MUS 1904 4 



50 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

contains, besides the administrative report, the following - live papers, 
constituting the general appendix to the volume: "An account of the 
exhibit of the National Museum at the Pan-American Exposition in 
Buffalo in 1901," by F. W. True, William H. Holmes, and George P. 
Merrill; "Flint Implements and Fossil Remains from a Sulphur 
Spring at Afton, Indian Territory," by Mr. William H. Holmes; 
"Classification and Arrangement of the Exhibits of an Anthropolog- 
ical Museum," by Mr. William H. Holmes; "Archeological Field 
Work in Northeastern Arizona," by Dr. Walter Hough; "Narrative 
of a Visit to Indian Tribes of the Purus River, Brazil," by Prof. J. B. 
Steere. The appendix to the report for 1902 consists of a paper on 
"Aboriginal American Basketry," by Prof. O. T. Mason; one on the 
" Herpetolog}' of Porto Rico," by Dr. Leonhard Stejneger; and one 
on " Wokas, a Primitive Food of the Klamath Indians," by Mr. F. V. 
Coville. 

Of the volumes of Proceedings, No. 25 was issued on July 24, 1903; 
No. 26 on August 27, 1903; and No. 27 on June 30, 1904. The total 
number of papers comprised in the three volumes is 107, numbered 
consecutivel} 7 from 1275 to 1381, inclusive. They are descriptive, 
either wholly or in part, of collections belonging to the Museum. 
The subjects treated of and the number of papers relating to each are 
as follows: Mammals, 5; birds, 10; reptiles, 2; tishes, 39; insects, 19; 
marine invertebrates, including mollusks, 21; plants, 4; fossils, 2; 
meteorites, 2; miscellaneous, 3. The authors are partly members of 
the Museum staff and partly collaborators connected with other estab- 
lishments. 

The Proceedings papers are first issued separately, in a limited 
edition, as soon as each can be printed, in order to insure their early 
distribution. The papers in the annual reports are also published in 
separate form, but not until the volume is completed. Except for this 
practice, which has long been followed, it would be impossible to sup- 
ply the requests of specialists, the completed volumes being mostly 
distributed to libraries and educational institutions. 

In Appendix III will be found the titles of all publications for 
the year by members of the staff and collaborators of the Museum. 
The number of papers cited is 315 and the number of authors 89. The 
papers are grouped by subjects in the following table:

The Editorial Office also has charge of other printing than that of 
the publications, including labels, blanks, stationery, cards, etc., and 
likewise of the binding of books, which together constitute a very 
considerable item. 

LIBRARY. 

The National Museum library has received as a gift from Prof. Otis 
Tuf<ton Mason, Head Curator of Anthropology, about 2,000 pamphlets, 
separates and bound volumes, mostly on anthropological subjects, for 
which a special bookplate has been provided. This is the second gen- 
erous contribution of the same character from Professor Mason. Dr. 
Edward L. Greene, recently appointed associate in botany, has depos- 
ited his entile botanical library, in connection with his botanical cob 
lection, for a period of ten years, the only condition stipulated being 
that while the books shall be accessible on the same terms as other 
books in the Museum library they are not to be lent outside the Dis- 
trict of Columbia without the consent of Doctor Greene. 

The Museum library now contains 2<),54S bound volumes and 35,960 
unbound papers. The additions during the year consisted of 1,504 
books, 3,187 pamphlets, and 700 parts of volumes. There were cata- 
logued 938 books, 2,130 pamphlets, and 11,520 parts of periodicals. 
The number of cards added to the author's catalogue was 4,090, exclu- 
sive of 2,855 cards for books and pamphlets recatalogued. Seventy 
broken sets of periodicals have been completed or partly so. The 
number of books, pamphlets, and periodicals borrowed from the gen- 
eral library was 26,456, including 5,679 assigned to the sectional 
libraries. 

There has been no change in the sectional libraries, which are as 
follows:

The report of the photographer of the Museum, Mr. T. \Y. Smillie, 
shows that 1,359 negatives, 3,501 silver prints, 373 platinum prints, 
140 velox prints, 79 lantern slides, 2,346 blueprints, and two enlarge- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 53 

merits were made during the } 7 ear. Under the direction of the Secre- 
tary, Mr. Smillie also devoted considerable time to recording- the 
flight of birds by means of telephoto cameras stationed at elevated 
points in the Zoological Park. He likewise rendered assistance to the 
Civil Service Commission in the examination of applicants for posi- 
tions in the Government service requiring- a practical knowledge of 
photography. 

COOPERATION OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT. 

The Museum has received, as usual, important assistance from sev- 
eral of the Departments and bureaus of the Government. Its relations 
to the U. S. Geological Surve} r , the Bureau of Fisheries, the Biolog- 
ical Survey and Divisions of Entomology and Botany of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, and the Bureau of American Ethnology, 
especially in regard to the transfer of collections, have been referred 
to elsewhere. Officers of the Army and Navy stationed in the new 
possessions have made valuable contributions, and representatives 
abroad of the Department of State have been instrumental in securing 
interesting material. The Departments of War and of the Navy have 
rendered generous help toward building up the collections of history 
and of the implements of war, having presented and deposited during 
the year many objects of exceeding interest and value. The Arm} 7 
Medical Museum has also cooperated most liberally in promoting the 
welfare of the recently established Division of Ph}-sical Anthropology. 
Special acknowledgments are due to the Quartermasters' Department 
of the Army for many courtesies in connection with the transporta- 
tion of specimens and outfits to and from distant points, and to the 
Treasury Department for the prompt admission and shipment to 
Washington of specimens received from abroad at several of the 
custom-houses. 

EXPOSITIONS. 

Louisiana Purchase Exposition. — The exhibits of the National Mu- 
seum, together with those of the Smithsonian Institution and of the 
other Government branches under its direction, were practically all in 
place in the Government building at St. Louis on the opening day, 
April 30, 1904. Under the direction of Dr. F. W. True, who represents 
the Institution and the Museum on the Government board, no pains 
have been spared to make this display both interesting and noteworthy. 

The anthropological exhibits of both the Museum and the Bureau 
of American Ethnology were assembled under the supervision of Mr. 
W. H. Holmes, whose principal aim in the former connection has been 
to illustrate the higher culture of the native American peoples as shown 
in their arts and industries, the specimens selected being as far as pos- 
sible the most typical of their kind. Among them are examples of 



54 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

native architecture, sculpture, ceramics, fabrics, metal work, and of the 
development in water craft, musical instruments, pipes, ceremonial 
objects, etc. The most striking feature of the exhibit is a series of 
five, models of ancient Aztec ruins in Mexico; namely, the "Temple 
of the Cross" at Palenque, Chiapas; the ""Temple of the Columns" at 
Mitla, Oaxaca; the temple of Xochicalco at Morales; the "Castle" at 
Chichen-Itza, Yucatan; and the '"House of the Governor" at Uxmal, 
Yucatan. The collection also contains a number of plaster rusts of 
some of the most famous religious sculptures of the Assyrians, Egyp- 
tians, Greeks, and Romans. 

In biology the most conspicuous objects are the cast and skeleton 
of a sulphur-bottom whale, about 80 feet long, taken off the coast of 
Newfoundland. Many of the larger mammals of the world are repre- 
sented by especially fine examples of the art of taxidermy, among them 
being the hippopotamus, rhinoceros, lion, tiger, giraffe, moose, cari- 
bou, axis-deer, sambur-stag, antelope, wild sheep, chamois, etc., and 
many birds of popular interest, such as game birds, birds of paradise, 
pheasants, the vulture, pelican, etc. A specimen of the curious hoact- 
zin of Guiana, South America, with its nest, eggs, and young, occupies 
a case by itself, and the great egg of the iEpyornis, a now extinct 
bird of Madagascar, is represented. Deep-sea fishes and some of the 
large species of reptiles are shown in the form of models, and there is 
also a fine display of butterflies, including many large and brilliant 
forms from tropical America and the Old World. An especial^ inter- 
esting feature is a reproduction of the "Children's Room" in the 
Smithsonian building at Washington. 

The most striking specimens in the Department of Geology are 
restorations of the large extinct Stegosaur and Triceratops, along- 
side of which have been placed the skeletons of a mastodon and an 
elephant, by way of contrast. Dr. George P. Merrill, in charge of 
this Department, has also brought together a very interesting collec- 
tion of meteorites, including casts of some of the largest ones known, 
such as that discovered by Lieutenant Peary in Greenland, and the 
Bacubarito meteorite found in the State of Sinaloa, Mexico. The 
mineral exhibit embraces some of the most beautiful varieties from 
all parts of the world, and is supplemented by two other collections, 
showing the various forms of silica and of carbonate of calcium. 
Among the fossil invertebrates are many interesting forms, and 
among the vertebrates are fishes, reptiles, a pterodactyl, and a com- 
plete skeleton of a moa, a large extinct flightless bird. 

The official report upon the exposition by Doctor True will appear 
in the next annual report. 

Lewis and Clark Msposition. — On April 13, 1904, the President of 
the United States approved the bill (S. 270) providing for the celebra 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 55 

tion of the one-hundredth anniversary of the exploration of the 
Oregon country by Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. 
The bill authorizes a Government exhibit in this connection, and 
appropriates $200,000 for its preparation, as well as $250,000 for a 
building. 

INTERNATIONAL CONGRESSES. 

At the Ninth International Geological Congress, held at Vienna. 
Austria, from August 20 to 27, 1903, the Smithsonian Institution and 
National Museum were represented by Mr. Charles Schuchert, assist- 
ant curator of stratigraphic paleontology. The total attendance at this 
congress from the United States was 22, papers being read by three 
of the number, namely, Prof. C. R. Van Hise, of the University of 
Wisconsin; Mr. Bailey Willis, of the U. S. Geological Survey, and 
Dr. E. O. Hovey, of the American Museum of Natural History. 

Delegates appointed before the end of the fiscal year to congresses 
to be held during the summer of 1901 were as follows: Dr. Leon- 
hard Stejneger, curator of reptiles and batrachians, Mr. Gen-it S. 
Miller, jr., assistant curator of mammals, and Dr. C. \V. Stiles, cus- 
todian of the helminthological collections, to the Sixth International 
Congress of Zoology, at Berne, Switzerland, during August; and Mr. 
William H. Holmes, Chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology, to 
the Congress of Americanists at Stuttgart, during the same month. 
These same persons were also designated by the Department of State 
as official representatives of the United States. 

Dr. Paul Haupt, honorary curator of historic archeology, was 
appointed, on April 30, 1904, to represent the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution and National Museum at the Fourteenth International Congress 
of Orientalists, to be held in Algiers in April, 1905. 

ORGANIZATION AND STAFF. 

The classification • of the scientific departments of the Museum 
remains as indicated in the report for last year, with the following 
exceptions: The title of the "division of religions" lias been changed 
to "division of historic religions," with Dr. Cyrus Adler as hon- 
orary curator, and the former " section of historic religious cere- 
monials" has been abolished. That of the " division of history and 
biography" has been changed to "division of history," with Mr. A. 
Howard Clark as honorary curator and Mr. Paul Beckwith as assist- 
ant curator, the "section of American history" being omitted. The 
"section of electricity " has been abolished, Mr. George C. Maynard, 
who was in charge of that section, being the assistant curator of the 
division of technology. 



56 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Mr. William II. Holmes, formerly Head Curator of the Department 
of Anthropology, but now Chief of the Bureau of American Ethnol- 
ogy, has accepted the position of honorary curator of the division of 
prehistoric archeology, and Mr. J. I). McGuire, also of the Bureau 
of Ethnology, that of collaborator in the same division. Other appoint- 
ments have been made as follows: Dr. Edward L. Greene, formerly 
professor of botany in the Catholic University of America, associate 
in botany; Mr. Paul Brockett, custodian of the division of graphic 
arts, and Mr. J. S. Goldsmith as superintendent of construction and 
labor, being a part of the service performed by the late Dr. J. E. 
Watkins. The appointment of Mr. Walter L. Halm, as aid in the 
division of mammals, in 1902-03, inadvertently failed to receive men- 
tion in the last report. 

A number of members of the scientific staff have severed their con- 
nection with the Museum, all at their own volition, to accept positions 
elsewhere at higher compensation. Among these were Mr. F. A. 
Lucas, curator of comparative anatomy, who has become curator-in- 
chief of the Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences; 
Mr. Louis Pollard, assistant curator in the division of plants; Mr. 
Rolla P. Currie, aid in the division of insects; and Mr. W. C. Phalen, 
aid, Messrs. R. S. Bassler and Alvan S. Stewart, preparators, in the 
Department of Geology. 

Dr. Marcus W. Lyon, jr., of the division of mammals, who on 
November 1, 1902, was temporarily transferred to the service of the 
Smithsonian Institution and its bureaus in connection with the exhibit 
at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition as chief special agent, is still 
employed in that capacity. 

NECROLOGY. 

It is with deep regret that I have to record the death, on August 
11, 1903, of Dr. J. Elfreth Watkins, whose official connection with 
the National Museum extended almost continuously over a period of 
nearly twenty years. 

Dr. Watkins was born in Ben Lomond, Virginia, on May IT, 1852, 
his parents being Dr. Francis B. Watkins and Mary Elfreth. He 
was a descendant of Thomas Watkins, who, during the War of the 
Revolution, aided in organizing a troop of cavalry, while on his 
mother's side he was connected with Timothy Matlack, known as the 
"Fighting Quaker," a member of the Committee on Safety in Penn- 
sylvania, and later a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1780 
to 1787; and also with John Elfreth, who served in the Philadelphia 
City Troops in 1814. 

After receiving an academic education at Tremont Seminary in 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 57 

Morristown, Pennsylvania, young Watkins entered Lafayette College, 
from which he was graduated in 1871, with the degrees of C. E. and 
M. S. He then became connected, as mining engineer, with the 
Delaware and Hudson Canal Company, remaining one year, after 
which he entered the employ of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company 
as assistant engineer of construction. In 1873 he was disabled for 
field work by an accident, which resulted in the loss of his right leg. 
Upon his recovery he was assigned to the Amboy division of the 
Pennsylvania road. In the same year he was appointed chief clerk 
of the Camden and Atlantic Railroad, and a year later was reassigned 
to the Amboy division of the Penns}dvania Railroad, which position 
he held until 1886, two years after the beginning of his connection 
with the National Museum. 

His first connection with the Museum was in 1884, when he was ap- 
pointed "honorary curator of transportation.''' In 1886 he accepted 
a salaried position in the service of the Museum, to which he devoted 
all of his time until 1892, when he returned to the Pennsylvania Rail- 
road Company and at once began the preparation of its exhibits for 
the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Later he was placed 
in charge of the Department of Industrial Arts in the Field Columbian 
Museum, a direct outgrowth of the exposition. He remained there 
only one year, however, coming back to Washington in 1895 to fill 
the positions of curator of mechanical technology and superintendent 
of buildings in the National Museum, w T hich he held until his death. 

In 1891 he became very active in promoting the interests of the 
Patent Centennial Celebration held in Washington, and served as sec- 
retary of the executive committee. 

Doctor Watkins was a member of several patriotic and other socie- 
ties, including the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Society of 
Colonial Wars, the Society of the Sons of the Revolution, the Society 
of the War of 1812, and the Philosophical Society of Washington. In 
recognition of his standing among authorities on the history of the 
mechanical arts the Stevens Institute of Technology conferred upon 
him the degree of "doctor of engineering " in 1900. 

Among the best known of his published writings are "Beginnings 
of Engineering''' (1888); " The Development of the Rail and Track" 
(1889); "The Log of the Savannah " (1890); and " Transportation and 
Lifting of Heavy Bodies by the Ancients " (1898). His most extensive 
literary undertaking was the compilation of the history of the Penn- 
sylvania Railroad from 1845 to 1896 (as yet unpublished), which also 
constitutes a very complete exposition of the general subject of rail- 
road transportation in the United States during the half century. 

Mr. Henry Marshall, taxidermist of the division of birds, during a 
period of nearly thirty years, died on May 26, 1904. He was born at 



58 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1004. 

Oldham, Yorkshire County, England, in 1823 and in 1846 emigrated 
to America, soon thereafter purchasing a farm at Laurel, Maryland, 
which remained his home until the time of his death. He first engaged 
in business as a machinist, in partnership with a brother; but having 
when a } T oung man learned taxidermy, he cultivated it as a recreation 
and partly as a matter of business, many colleges and other public 
institutions being supplied with specimens of his handiwork. In 1875 
he was appointed to the position of taxidermist in the National 
Museum, where he continued in service until stricken with paratysis 
on July 1*>, L901.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY 
FOR THE YEAR 1903-04. 

By Otis T. Mason, 
Acting Head Curator. 

The work of the year has been devoted to the care of specimens in 
hand and of new materials daily arriving, to finding- safe and accessible 
storage for collections not on exhibition; but, more than all, to making 
the department useful "for the increase and diffusion of knowledge." 

Although the specimens received number over 5,000 less than in the 
previous year, when 24,319 were catalogued, they were on the whole 
as valuable, for the reason that besides those acquired without definite 
aim very many were secured for the purpose of perfecting old series 
or of making new ones to illustrate special points in anthropology. 
Some of the more valuable accessions are here enumerated: 

GIFTS. 

The W, L. Abbott collection, numbering 1,377 specimens from the 
Malay Peninsula, northern Sumatra, and the adjacent archipelago, 
adds materially to the resources of the Museum from this almost 
virgin area. These, with his gatherings in former years from the 
East Indies and other parts of Asia, form a most valuable addition to 
the Museum, and constitute the basis of a monograph on the ethnology 
of the regions explored by Doctor Abbott, now in course of prepara- 
tion by Professor Mason and Doctor Hough. The collection illustrates 
the arts of the people of this region, who are especially skillful in the 
use of plant and vegetable materials, of which the most serviceable is 
rattan. Besides the ethnological, there are also specimens in physical 
anthropology, consisting of Moro skulls and monkey and ape brains. 

Of unusual interest and value is the collection of 278 ancient Egyptian 
chipped stone specimens presented by Mr. II. W. Seton-Karr, which 
includes crescent-shaped implements, leaf -shaped and semilunar 
blades, spearheads, saws, scrapers, a tine collection of arrow points with 
extremely long barbes, knives with handles in one piece, and a number 
of specialized forms for cutting. Mr. Seton-Karr writes: 

They are all from the Fayum, and arc of a type mainly peculiar to that district. 

They were found in the desert about 10 miles from present cultivation, the ancient 

prehistoric lake having a much higher level than the dynastic or, of course, the 

present one.

62 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

There was also secured a large and representative series of archeo- 
logical specimens, part of a bequest to the U. S. National Museum, in 
1898, b} T the late I. H. Harris, of Waynesville, Ohio. The archeo- 
logical portion was placed in the division of prehistoric archeology, 
and consists mainly of stone implements, including hammer stones, 
pestles, mortars, grooved axes, polished hatchets, discoidal stones, 
polished stone amulets, beads, pipes, leaf-shaped blades, arrow points 
and spearheads, scrapers, drills, shell beads, carvings, and a limited 
number of copper implements and ornaments. A catalogue was fur- 
nished, giving exact data for a portion of the collection. A number 
of other specimens had the locality marked upon them, and from this 
source as well as from letters and memoranda, it is shown that the 
material was obtained mainly from a few spots in the Miami Valley, 
Ohio. There is, in addition, a typical series of earthenware vessels 
From mounds near Charleston. Missouri. The whole embraces 8,533 
numbers, although several lots of small flakes and fragments arc 
counted as one number. 

The ethnological and historical collections from the Philippine 
Islands presented to the Museum by Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, 
are especially interesting and valuable from the fact that they were 
secured personally in the campaign against the Moros of Mindanao by 
an experienced observer. They comprise manj^ specimens not hereto- 
fore in the National Museum, and are rich in weapons, basketry, and 
the fine brasswork for which the Moros are so famous. 

An important addition to the historical division is the gilt dress 
sword presented to (Ten. Jacob Brown by the State of New York for 
services in the war of 1812. This sword was received as a gift from 
his grandson, Nathan Brown Chase. 

Other interesting specimens received during the year are a serenato 
saxophone, with accessories and instructions, presented by William 
Tonk & Bro., of New York, which fills a niche in the collection of 
musical instruments; a rare flintlock pistol with folding bayonet, 
made by Miles, London, and presented by Mr. Paul E. Beckwith. 

A collection of Morse keys, insulators, and other important his- 
torical apparatus used on telegraph lines in the United States about 
1860, was presented by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company through 
C. E. McKim, superintendent of telegraphs at Pittsburg; a telegraph 
switch, invented about 1855 by E. AY. Culgan, of Pittsburg, Pennsyl- 
vania, and used generally throughout the United States up to 1865, 
presented by Mr. C. S. Greer, of Zanesville, Ohio; a series of speci- 
mens illustrating the development of the hand camera, donated by the 
Eastman Kodak Company, of Rochester, New York; a collection of 
native firearms from the Philippine Islands, presented by the President 
of the United States; and a series of heliogravures of Hellenistic por- 



REPORT OE ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 63 

traits, useful in connection with the study of the physiognomy of the 
nations, was given by Theodor Graf, of Vienna, Austria. 

PURCHASES. 

During the year the Museum acquired by purchase the huge archeo- 

logical collection from various European localities (11,519 specimen-). 
and a smaller collection (7,815 specimens) of American objects, belong- 
ing to the estate of the late Dr. Thomas Wilson. The European 
collection covers a wide range, beginning with the roughly shaped 
flint implements from the river gravels of England and France, and 
ending with the more highly elaborated objects of the polished stone 
age and the bronze age. The more important groups from Europe 
include objects of stone, bone, pottery, and bronze from the Swiss 
lakes; a fine series of chipped and polished stone implements from 
Scandinavia; and pottery and bronzes from Italy. Of the American 
series, the most notable are the large collection of stone implements, 
etc., from Fairfax County, Virginia (the Hunter collection); two sets 
of cache implements, one including 18 leaf-shaped blades of quart- 
zite from Carter County, Tennessee; and 14 large spearheads of 
quartzite from Pike County. Arkansas. 

A collection of 1 house posts and 2 totem poles was purchased from 
Dr. George A. Dorsey for exhibition at St. Louis. The house posts, 
hewn from yellow cedar, are very interesting specimens, and were 
secured personally by Doctor Dorse\ T from a Tlinkit village. Each 
pair is 10 feet in height, 2£ feet in breadth, and nearly 4 inches in 
thickness. The posts are carved, and two of them are of especial 
interest owing to the fact that they are painted. The totem poles rank 
among the best examples of wood carving from the Northwest Coast. 

Owing to the widespread popular interest in basketry, a number of 
collections were offered to the Museum, and of these 54 tine examples 
of Nez Perce, Chemehuevi, and Maidu baskets were purchased from 
the Fred Harvey collection, rendering more complete the large and 
valuable series now displayed in the north-west gallery. 

A collection of 48 examples of aboriginal art from southeastern 
Alaska, consisting of carved clubs, knives, figures, dishes, chests, and 
embroidered blankets, was purchased from Lieut. G. T. Emmons, 
U. S. Navy, whose long familiarity with the tribes of this region 
enhances their value. 

The purchase of 14 specimens of crania of the Wasco Indians from 
the Fred Harvey collection made an important addition to the division 
of physical anthropology. 

A series of models of steamboat propellers, dating from L681 to 1825, 
and illustrating the development of this feature of marine architecture 
for that period, were purchased from Mr. Emil Wellauer. 



64 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Casts of Assyro-Babylonian, Egyptian, and Grrseeo-Roinan sculp- 
tures were purchased from various dealers in England, France, Italy, 
and the United States. In this collection is a stele engraved with the 
code of laws of the Babylonian King, Hammurabi, which is of peculiar 
interest, as it aids in portraying the civilization of Babylon more than 
four thousand years ago. 

EXCHANGES. 

Among the specimens acquired through exchange during the year 
may be mentioned copies of rare musical instruments received from 
Mrs. John Crosby Brown, in exchange for similar material; and 28 
specimens illustrative of the folklore of England and Ireland from 
Edward Lovett, Esq., Croydon, England, in exchange for American 
Indian specimens. 

TRANSFERS AND LOANS. 

A very interesting collection numbering 550 specimens was secured 
by J. Walter Fewkes, of the Bureau of American Ethnology. It 
includes objects from the islands of Trinidad, Grenada, Cariaco, St. 
Vincent, Barbados, Dominica, Porto Rico, and Cuba. The most nota- 
ble of these are stone collars, tripointed stone zemes, earthenware 
bowls of unique form and decoration, and a series of carved stone 
masks and amulets. There are also polished hatchets and chisels, axes 
of the Carib type, sculptured pestles, mortars, heads of stone, shell 
hatchets, and grotesque heads and faces used as decorations of pottery 
vessels. This collection was made systematically with a view to work- 
ing out the ancient connections between the two continents of North 
and South America. 

A large number of archeological objects from various caverns, rock- 
shelters, and village sites in the Ozark region in Missouri and Arkan- 
sas, collected by William H. Holmes, were obtained by transfer from 
the Bureau of American Ethnology. These include chipped flint 
implements, ranging from roughly worked pieces and blades to well- 
finished arrow points, spearheads, and scrapers; hammer and rubbing 
stones, bone implements, fragments of pottery, pieces of basket work, 
woven fabrics, twisted cords made from the vegetable liber, cave 
breccia containing flints, animal bones (mainly split), and a few human 
bones. The objects are exceptionally well classified. The position, 
whether in caves, village sites, bottom lands, etc., is carefully marked, 
and in addition there are furnished two maps and four charts upon 
which the different localities arc indicated. The collection, which 
numbers 2,71<> specimens, is a notable addition to the Museum, as it 
represents material from new areas. 



EEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 65 

The division of physical anthropology has been enriched by over 
2,000 crania and skeletons transferred from the Army Medical Museum. 

During- the last few years the curator of the division of technology 
has made special effort to increase the series illustrating the develop- 
ment of firearms. Recently there has been lent by Col. Wright Rives 
a finely finished 44-caUber rifle, made by Henry Deringer, Philadel- 
phia, Pennsylvania, and often used for target practice by David 
Crockett and other friends of Mr. Rives. This was the rifle used by 
W. J. Graves in his duel with Jonathan Cilley^ in 1838. 

There may also be mentioned a valuable series of sporting rifles, 
collected by Mr. Herman Hollerith in Mitchell County, North Caro- 
lina, in 1893, and lent by him to the Museum. These are typical 
specimens of sporting guns used throughout the United States up to 
about 1850. They are provided with homemade powderhorns, pow- 
der charges, turkey calls, and other appliances, showing the skill of 
the early backwoodsman. 

A collection of rifles, muskets, carbines, and revolvers has been 
transferred to the National Museum by the Ordnance Office of the 
War Department. These weapons include, besides the guns manu- 
factured by the Government for many years, fine specimens made by 
private firms for the Government. There is one remarkable example, 
which is a 7-barrel flintlock revolving gun, with 11-inch barrels, 
caliber .50, fastened to a central frame and revolved b} T hand, to bring 
each barrel successivel}* under a common flash pan. 

Another especial^ rare and valuable loan from the War Depart- 
ment is the Ferguson breech-loading rifle, which it has been claimed 
is the only one of its kind in existence. It was invented and patented 
in England in 1775-76 by Maj. Patrick Ferguson, of the British Army, 
and was manufactured by Mr. D. Egg, of London. This gun was 
presented by Major Ferguson to Capt. Frederick de Peyster and 
bequeathed by him to his son. Gen. John Watts de Peyster. 

To the division of history there has been added a number of objects 
illustrating the colonial and Revolutionary periods, including inter- 
esting relics received from Gen. John Watts de Peyster, who has 
during the last few years presented his Napoleonic library to the 
Smithsonian Institution. Mention may also be made of the sword and 
epaulets worn by Gen. Alexander McComb, U. S. Army, a loan from 
Mrs. F. C. d"Hautville, and of a fine portrait in oil of George Catlin, 
the Indian portrait painter, received from Mrs. Louise Catlin Kinney. 
The portrait, which is an excellent likeness, was painted in 1849 by 
Mr. W. H. Fisk, R. A. It adds much to the interest of the great 
collection of Indian portraits given to the Museum many years ago. 

As a result of the war with Spain in 1898 the Museum has gradually 
acquired a large number of objects illustrating the history of the peo- 

NAT MUS 1904 5 



66 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

pie of our insular possessions. During the past year Dr. K. 13. Grubb, 
U. S. Army, added to his collection 53 specimens from the Moros of 
western Mindanao, Philippine Islands, consisting of edged weapons, 
spears, armor, ceremonial objects, matting and costumes of these 
interesting and warlike people. 

EXPLORATIONS. 

Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, of the Bureau of American Ethnology, con- 
tinued his researches in the West Indies, visiting Cuba, Porto Rico, 
and other islands as far south as Trinidad. His collection contains 
many notable objects in carved stone, as zemes, or tripointed idols, 
masks, amulets, pottery of rare forms, and implements and utensils of 
hard, finely-polished rock. 

Field work in New Mexico and Arizona was carried on by Dr. 
Walter Hough, assistant curator of the division of ethnology, who 
succeeded in obtaining a valuable collection of basketry, pottery, stone, 
bone, wood, and shell implements, weapons, ornaments, and ceremonial 
objects from a region heretofore unexplored. Ruins near Magdalena, 
Datil, along the upper Tulerosa River at Frisco, and near Luna, 
New Mexico, were examined. The last named were excavated and 
important data and specimens were collected. A reconnoissance of 
cave and cliff ruins in this region was made and a number of specimens 
secured. At the close of the work Doctor Hough proceeded north- 
westward by way of Alpine, Nutrioso, Springerville, and St. Johns, to 
the Santa Fe Railroad at Holbrook, Arizona. During his trip he trav- 
ersed a stretch of country 270 miles wide between points on the rail- 
roads. The object of Doctor Hough was to cut across lines of north 
and south migration of peoples in early times, and in this respect much 
valuable information was gathered. 

In May, Mr. George C. Maynard commenced a special investigation 
of the history of the locomotive " Stourbridge Lion," with a view to 
clearing up some unsettled questions relating to the authenticity of 
parts of the locomotive in the custody of the Museum, as well as to 
determine the whereabouts of other parts now in the possession of 
private parties. He visited Honesdale, Carbondale, Pittston, Scran- 
ton and other places in Pennsylvania, where he obtained much valuable 
information. 

Mr. Paul E. Beckwith, assistant curator in the division of histoiy, 
acting under special directions from the Assistant Secretary, spent the 
month of June at the Louisiana Purchase F .position examining 
certain anthropological collections. 

CARE OF THE COLLECTIONS. 

No changes have been made in the method of handling accessions. 
All collections received during the year have been catalogued and 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 67 

cared for, and, so far as possible, systematically arranged. Specimens 
subject to destruction b} T insects have been poisoned. 

Increased space and facilities for preservation and installation were 
obtained by the finishing- of the repairs in the hall of prehistoric 
archeology, which has been closed for two years; by dismounting 
man} T pictures from swinging screens and putting the former into the 
study series; by building additional racks for unit drawers in the hall 
of history and in the graphic arts storage; by adding to the furni- 
ture in the east hall a large gun rack, presented by the War Depart- 
ment; and by building new racks in the laboratory of physical 
anthropology. 

A great deal of time has been spent in labeling the musical instru- 
ments, which number nearly fifteen hundred pieces. This collection 
is in the care of Mr. E. H. Hawley, who has completed an elaborate 
catalogue of the entire series. It is provided with four sets of labels, 
as follows: 

1. General labels, descriptive of the plan of classification. 

2. Case labels, naming the class of instruments in each inclosure. 

3. Descriptive labels, explaining the structure and functions of the 
instruments in each case. 

4. Individual labels, giving the native name, the English name, 
locality and peoples, and collector of each specimen. 

The collection has been installed to teach history of thought and of 
development through inventions, from the simplest monotone device 
to mark rhythm up to the most elaborate apparatus for musical expres- 
sion. The exhibit is divided into four grand divisions, according to 
the structure of the instruments, and the pieces are arranged accord- 
ing to simplicity or supposed order of invention. The divisions may 
be described as follows: 

(I) Vibrating solid, sonorous bodies; (II) vibrating membranes; (III) 
vibrating strings; (IV) vibrating columns or currents of air. 

Musical instruments are put into vibration or functioned: (1) imme- 
diately, by human agency only; ('2) mediately, by means of devices in 
the hand; (3) mechanically, through the agency of keyboards and the 
like, and (4) automatically, by machinery, which demands no skill; 
(5) iEolian harps and wind bells are vibrated without human agency. 
There are five methods employed in playing, namel} 7 , striking or ham- 
mering; picking or twanging; rubbing with the hand, bow, wheel, etc.; 
blowing; and sympathetically. 

The four grand divisions have been mounted, where practicable, so 
as to indicate geographic and ethnic distribution, and arranged in sets 
as related to the musical scale. Some advance has been made in the 
literature of music, but none in collecting portraits of composers, 
instrument makers, or writers on the subject, 



68 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Case and specimen labels were prepared for the series illustrating 
heating 1 and illuminating and other subjects, and many hundreds of 
labels were printed for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. Mr. 
Thomas Sween}^ continued the systematic care of the study series. 

EXHIBITION AND STUDY SERIES. 

The crowded condition of the Museum seriously interferes with the 
association of the exhibition with the study series. The ideal connec- 
tion between the two is partly maintained in the northwest range and 
in a few other parts of the Museum where the student, attracted by a 
specimen, wishes to go further into the subject, and finds the study 
series close at hand. But in other exhibits the study material has to 
be stored away so as to be practically inaccessible. 

The exhibits in many of the halls are in a satisfactory condition, 
being well arranged and well labeled; but in other halls old-fashioned 
methods still prevail and the labeling is inadequate. 

INSTALLATION. 

A number of cases were arranged in the northwest gallery, to illus- 
trate the different types of basketry, this subject having attracted 
much popular attention of late owing to the publication by the National 
Museum of Professor Mason's monograph on Aboriginal American 
Basketiy. A collection of lamps has been arranged in the east hall, 
to show the development of illumination. A tine portrait of George 
Catlin, lent by his daughter, Mrs. Louise Catlin Kinney, was installed 
in the north-west range amidst the great painter's works. A large 
number of specimens from the Philippine Islands, from various sources, 
were set up for exhibition in the galleiy of the north-west court. 
Among these is the Mearns collection from Mindanao. A special 
studio was set apart for the Abbott collections from Mala} T sia, with 
reference to publishing an illustrated account of them. A great deal 
of time was expended in the installation of musical instruments, now 
one of the richest in the world. A rare collection of objects illus- 
trating Tibetan religion has been set up and labeled. A walnut case 
extending along one side of the east hall has been installed with a 
large collection of muskets, rifles, and carbines, some of which were 
received from the War Department; and three table-cases, especially 
lifted up for the exhibition of revolvers and pistols, were also placed in 
the east hall and tilled with a collection of historical military revolvers, 
and single and double barreled pistols of various dates and types, 
some of which are not duplicated, so far as known, in any other public 
or private collection. The original Francis life-saving car was perma- 
nently installed in a new mahogany case, especially designed for the 
purpose; while another was made for the cylinder of the Hornblower 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 69 

engine, the first steam engine ever erected on the western continent, 
having been imported from England in 1753, set up by Josiah Horn- 
blower, and used for pumping water from the copper mines of Col. 
John Schuyler, located opposite Belleville, near Newark, New Jersey. 
Two clocks received from the Chelsea Clock Company, of Boston, 
through the courtesy of Charles H. Pearson, treasurer, were placed 
in the east hall near the telegraph instruments. Here the noon signals 
are received from the IT. S. Naval Observatory, and serve a useful pur- 
pose in illustrating to visitors the Government's method of distributing 
correct time throughout the United States. 

The Daughters of the American Revolution have manifested great 
interest in the historic collections, and cases especially devoted to their 
contributions have been arranged and labeled. 

MODELS AND REPLICAS. 

Models of a large number of objects, chiefly ethnologic, have been 
made under the supervision of the Department for use in filling out 
the series of exhibits in the Museum and for exchange purposes. A 
number of replicas in plaster have also been prepared under the direc- 
tion of Mr. William H. Holmes, including a series of casts of 120 of 
the most important archeologic objects illustrating the higher achieve- 
ments of the ancient Mexican peoples. One set of these; carefully 
colored, was installed with the Museum's exhibit at the St. Louis 
Exposition, while several additional sets were prepared for exchange 
with other museums. These replicas have been executed with the 
greatest care, and one series has been photographed side by side 
with the original objects for distribution to the museums with which 
exchanges are contemplated. Up to the present time these include 
the Field Columbian Museum, Chicago; Carnegie Museum, Pittsburg; 
Free Museum of Science and Art, Philadelphia; American Museum 
of Natural History, New York; Museum of the Brooklyn Institute 
of Arts and Sciences, Brooklyn; Peabod}^ Museum, Cambridge; and 
also with the following foreign museums: Trocadero Museum, Paris; 
British Museum, London; Royal Ethnological Museum, Berlin; Royal 
Museum of Dresden; National Museum of Mexico, and the National 
Museum of Argentina. 

The preparators of this Department, from plans by Mr. Holmes, 
also constructed models of a number of the ruined buildings of Mexico 
and Yucatan, five of which were completed and installed with the 
exhibit prepared for the St. Louis Exposition. These represent the 
" Pjn-amid Temple," Xochicalco; the "Temple of the Columns," Mitla; 
"House of the Governor," Uxmal; "El Castillo," Chichenitza; and 
the "Temple of the Cross," Palenque. Models are kept of such parts 
of these as can be cast in plaster for use in preparing replicas. 

In the laboratory of this Department twenty masks, besides other 



YO REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

castings of Indians belonging to delegations visiting Washington, have 
also been made at the expense of the Bureau of American Ethnologj^, 
and from these a number of busts have been prepared for the Museum 
exhibits and for exchange with other museums. Some material has 
already been received from the Field Columbian Museum, the Ameri- 
can Museum of Natural History, and the Royal Ethnological Museum, 
Berlin, in exchange for casts. It is expected that these exchanges will 
result in adding greatly to the collections in the National Museum, and 
at the same time they will enrich the various museums with which 
arrangements are made. 

The work of photographing Indians visiting Washington has been 
greatly enlarged during the year. By special arrangement whole dele- 
gations have visited the Museum, where photographs of them, either 
singly or in groups, have been made and measurements taken. 

RESEARCHES. 

In the past ten years, the Museum has been receiving from Dr. 
William L. Abbott important ethnological collections made by him in 
the Eastern Continent, especially in southern Malaysia. During last 
year much time was spent in arranging and classifying this material, 
and in preparing descriptions and illustrations for publication. The 
work will be continued during the coming year. Mr. Holmes has 
continued intermittently the preparation of a monograph on the mines 
and quarries of the aborigines, based to a large extent upon collections 
in the division of prehistoric archeology. Mr. Paul Beckwith began 
a systematic description of the Grant relics in the National Museum, 
for publication in the form of an illustrated catalogue. He has also 
prepared a card catalogue of the swords, with the view of studying the 
evolution of this arm, and has continued his work on a catalogue of 
the collections of ancient coinage in the Museum. 

Doctor Hrdlicka made measurements on negro children and adults, 
and on 32 Indians belonging to visiting delegations. He continued 
his studies on the humerus, atlas, cranial fossa?, parietal and malar 
bones, and also commenced testing the value and effect of various 
preservatives on the excised brain. 

The usefulness of the Department of Anthropology to students and 
investigators is shown b} 7 the number of persons who have derived 
benefit therefrom. Each year more and more institutions and indi- 
viduals seek access to these collections, and through the cordial rela- 
tions thus established the Department has not only contributed to 
education, but has profited in the increase of its material for study. 
Among those visiting the Museum for the purpose of carrying on 
researches in its anthropological material may be mentioned the 
following: 

Professor Sherrington, of the University College, Liverpool, inves- 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 7l 

tigated the negro brains in the collection, in order to determine the 
relative proportions of the windings of the Rolandic fissure in this 
race. Miss Voorhees examined the collections from prehistoric Europe 
in connection with a stud}^ on the Man of the Drift Gravels and 
the Cave Dwellers of France. Miss Marie Ruef Hofer, of Teachers 
College, Columbia University, New York, examined the plan of 
synoptic series in the Museum as a basis of exercise and manual labor 
teaching. John P. S. Neligh, of Columbus, Georgia, studied Indian 
textile art, basketry, beadwork, and weaving, with a view to teaching. 
Ole Solberg, from Christiania, Norway, spent several days in the 
Museum, preparing himself for a trip to Arizona, in order to investi- 
gate the social customs of theHopi (Mold); on his return he examined 
the Eskimo collection, with a view to enlarging his monograph on 
Eskimo stone implements. 

Judge James Wickersham, U. S. District Judge, Eagle Cit}^ Alaska, 
made studies of the works and social customs of the Indians in that 
region, with a view to deciding their fitness for citizenship, and con- 
sulted the division of ethnology on what constitutes civilized tribes, 
with a view to enfranchising certain tribes of his judicial district. 
Lieut. William E. W. McKinlay, of the First U. S. Cavalry, having 
been detailed by the Division of Military Information in the War 
Department to work up grammars and dictionaries. of the chief lan- 
guages in the Philippines, utilized the resources and methods of the 
Department of Anthropology to aid him in his labors. Miss Maude 
Barrows Dutton, Columbia University, New York Chy,-spent Febru- 
ary 19 to February 29 in the Museum, gathering illustrations for a 
series of school readers to show the development of primitive indus- 
tries. Miss Cora M. Folsom, curator of the museum at Armstrong 
School, Hampton, Virginia, examined cases, methods of exhibition, 
and the Museum system of caring for the stud} r series; she also received 
instructions in cataloguing, poisoning, and other museum work. The 
Director of the Mint, Mr. George E. Roberts, selected from the 
Museum twenty-eight coins to illustrate a lecture on numismatics, and 
transparencies were made for him in the Museum laboratory. Mr. 
Stewart Culin, curator of the division of ethnology in the Brooklyn 
Institute, made further studies in the games of the American Indians, 
with reference to a paper being published by the Bureau of American 
Ethnology. Miss Grace Nicholson, Pasadena, California, spent the 
month of June at the Museum, studying the classification and care of 
basketry; and the Immigration Bureau of the Department of Com- 
merce and Labor, through its statistician, Mr. Wells F. Andrews, 
consulted the Division of Ethnology for the purpose of obtaining 
information which would enable the Bureau to classify more exactly 
by nationality and race the vast number of immigrants into the United 
States. 



72 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

The following material was transmitted to students and investigators 
outside of the Museum: A number of photographs lent to Miss Maude 
Barrows Dutton, of New York City, for reproduction in a series of text- 
books prepared under the supervision of the Teachers College, Columbia 
University; whale tusks, implements connected with whale fishing, and 
a number of models of fishermen's boats lent to Mr. W. de C. Rave- 
nel, in charge of the exhibit of the Bureau of Fisheries, Department 
of Commerce and Labor, at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition; a num 
ber of arrows from the Natano (Hupa) Indians of California, Indian 
games (3), Indian tops, and Indian popguns, were lent to Mr. Stewart 
Culin, to be used in illustrating a paper published by the Bureau of 
American Ethnology; models of Indian fire-making apparatus were 
lent to Mr. Gerard Fowke, for the general anthropological exhibit at 
the Louisiana Purchase Exposition; the original Francis life-saving 
car was lent to the Treasury Department for exhibit at the Louisiana 
Purchase Exposition. To Mr. S. W. Stratton, of the Bureau of 
Standards, for the same purpose, were lent examples of Mexican and 
Japanese scales, the coin scales of England, and a set of antique silver- 
smith's weights, manufactured in Nuremburg, Germany; from the 
division of histoiy a number of specimens connected with the mili- 
tary life of Gen. W. T. Sherman were lent, upon the request of Mr. 
P. T. Sherman, to the U. S. Military Academy, for exhibition at the 
Louisiana Purchase Exposition; and an interesting case of historical 
specimens belonging to the Daughters of the American Revolution 
was sent to the exposition in the care of Mr. Paul Beckwith, for 
installation. 

It is the policy of the Department of Anthropology not to send out 
valuable specimens to individuals for stud} r , but to invite them to 
carry on their investigations at the Museum. This course is safer for 
the collections, and the student himself is thereby brought into touch 
with other materials of which he probably has had no knowledge. 

PLANS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. 

The Acting Head Curator calls attention to the need of additional 
help in the several divisions. Accessions are multiplied, the corre- 
spondence has greatly increased, and yet the same number of men and 
women have to do the work. These conditions have been recognized 
and remedied as far as possible by temporary aid. 

From Doctor Hough the following observations are received with 
reference to the plans for the development of the division of eth- 
nology: 

This is the era of collector-dealers in ethnology. Material that falls into their 
hands is held for sale, so that a museum must enter the lists with money to purchase 
or must go into the field as a collector. The latter plan tends to build up a museum 
with the most desirable material, but it requires funds as well as trained men who 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 73 

must spend part of the time in the field, and part in the care of the specimens. It is 
also most desirable to foster disinterested collectors, who engage in the work for 
relaxation without thought of gain. It is the opinion of the Curator that this matter 
of providing for the purchase of specimens should have attention by the Museum 
authorities. The interior development of the Division as pursued by the Curator 
and his assistant has been carried on (1) by the study of correlated objects, publi- 
cation, and exhibition to the best advantage for educational purposes; (2) by the 
grouping of ethnic material to show at a glance the life and arts of tribes and peo- 
ples; (3) the collection of information regarding specimens and filing such data where 
it is readily available for students and for lables; (4) the storing of photographic 
blueprints by subjects. This work is being steadily carried on and is improving the 
status of the division each year. 

Mr. Holmes has planned a sweeping reinstallation of the division 
of prehistoric archeology. To the exhibits prepared for the Louisi- 
ana Purchase Exposition will be assigned the space in the middle of 
the hall. Mr. Ma}nard proposes to enlarge the subject of metrology 
in all its branches, by originals when possible, and also by copies and 
models of originals. He also will assiduously increase the material in 
the section of gunnery, for which the time is propitious. In this con- 
nection Mr. Maynard has prepared an elaborate classification of the 
topics under his division. Mr. Brockett plans to very much enlarge 
the study series in graphic arts by bringing from storage and putting 
in new drawers much material hitherto unavailable. Doctor Flint, 
having completed his classification and cataloguing .in the division of 
medicine, will develop his plan on the lines established. In the divi 
sion of history, Mr. Beckwith will avail himself of the gallery recently 
assigned to him to enlarge and improve the study series. The assist- 
ant curator of the division of physical anthropology, Dr. A. Hrd- 
licka, makes the following recommendations: 

The time has come when the division of physical anthropology can begin to pre- 
pare exhibits of great interest and instructive value, relating on the one hand to the 
American aborigines, and on the other to man in general. The part concerning the 
Indian would complete the immense ethnological exhibit; that concerning man in 
general would be a continuation of the series in biology. To achieve these results, 
the division is in need of the exclusive services of a modeler. A most important 
part of the Indian exhibits, and at the same time valuable for exchanges with other 
museums, would be a series of casts of the natives. For this purpose the modeler 
should take visiting Indians, and also be sent to do field work. In the biological 
exhibits, an important role would be played by casts of brain and other objects; by 
representations in plaster of human development and decline; and by showing the 
numerous types of man. All this will require the constant application of an able 
modeler through a number of years, and the work can and should be begun at once. 

Doctor Hrdlicka also calls attention to the fact that a compre- 
hensive biological survey of the people of the United States is a pos- 
sibility, though it would be difficult, extend over a number of years, 
and require a large corps of trained aids. There is no other country 
that presents more vital problems to be solved by such a survey 



74 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

than the United States. This is due to the great diversity of its cli- 
mate and industries; but above all, to the heterogeneity of its con- 
stituents. The objects of such a survey would be to investigate the 
physical status; certain physiological elements; relative fecundity; 
the effects of racial mixtures; and certain pathological conditions 
which have important influences on the population. These investiga- 
tions would have to be prosecuted on (a) the various racial divisions 
of the population; (/>) the Americans in large cities, as well as those 
in the rural districts; those living in high and those in low lands; those 
in the coldest and in the hottest regions; the seamen with extremes in 
kinds of nourishment; (c) all such parts of the population as follow 
the same mode of physical or mental activity, such as the laborer, 
specialized artisan, professional athlete, specialized brainworker, the 
highest class of inventor or original composer; (d) such divisions of 
the population as are continuously subjected to differing social condi- 
tions, and (f) the defective classes. In order that a survey of this 
nature should succeed in this country, the very first condition would be 
to elaborate, as far as possible, in conjunction with the Immigration 
Bureau and the Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce 
and Labor, accurate maps representing the racial constituents of the 
population. 

Mr. Hawley proposes to complete his card catalogue of all the types 
of musical instruments ever used by man; also by exchanges, copies, 
and models to make the series of specimens complete as to types. 

In looking over the stock of material already mounted for exhibition 
in swinging screens, unit boxes, and special frames, it was found that 
much of it was piled up in such a way that for years it would be lost 
not only to the public but also to the student. In the new Museum 
installation should not be handicapped by faded backgrounds, soiled 
labels, and discarded furniture. Therefore many hundreds of speci- 
mens have been cut from the mountings and returned to the study 
series, the boxes and frames being sent to storage. In this way the 
floors of the halls have been cleared of packing boxes. It is purposed 
to continue this process into spaces now set apart for storage. 

The general plan for the Department during the year 1904-5 will be 
to make the collections still more useful to the students, authors, and 
teachers. No changes of arrangement are contemplated for the pres- 
ent building, but every effort will be made to perfect the exhibits that 
will be set up in the new one. 

CHANGES IN THE DEPARTMENT. 

Owing to the constant growth of the Department of Anthropology, 
it was deemed wise during the year to make certain changes in its 
organization, so that at present all divisions of the subject that may 
be taught and studied by objects are represented. Physiological 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 75 

psychology is omitted, since its operations consist of experiments. 
Its apparatus is provided for in the division of technology, under the 
class of metrics. Language also is omitted, since its investigation is 
assigned to the Bureau of American Ethnology. The same is to be 
said of sociology and primitive religions. The closest relationship, 
however, exists between the two dependencies of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, the Museum, and the Bureau of American Ethnology, since 
cult objects, the paraphernalia of customs, writings, and inscriptions 
are tangible things and may be exhibited. Mr. William H. Holmes 
served as honorary curator, and Mr. J. D. McGuire as collaborator 
in the division of prehistoric archeology, Mr. E. P. Upham having 
charge of cataloguing. The division of technology was enlarged to 
include all phases of handicraft. Mr. Paul Brockett has been made 
custodian of the division of graphic arts. The division of religions 
becomes the division of historic religions, the cults of unlettered 
peoples being assigned to the Bureau of American Ethnology and 
their cult objects exhibited in the division of ethnology. The divi- 
sion of history and biography becomes the division of history, with 
Mr. A. H. Clark as honorary curator and Mr. Paul Beckwith, 
assistant curator. In February Miss Mary Virginia Young was 
made clerk in the office of the Acting Head Curator, and in April Mr. 
Richard A. Allen was appointed preparator in the Department. 



REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY 
FOR THE YEAR 1903-04. 

By Frederick W. Trie. 
Head t 'urator. 

The principal event of the year covered by this report was the com- 
pletion of the exhibit for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition and its 
installation in St. Louis. Fully two years were occupied in assembling 
and preparing this exhibit, and the staff of every division of the 
department, except that of plants, shared in the work to a greater or 
less extent. The Head Curator, having been placed in charge of the 
entire exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution, found it impossible to 
attend at the same time to the regular work of the department, and 
for about live months the general management devolved upon one of 
the curators, Dr. L. Stejneger. A full report on the. St. Louis exhibit 
will lie submitted next year after the close of the exposition. 

The Museum had the good fortune to receive on deposit for ten 
years the herbarium and botanical library of Prof. E. L. Greene. The 
herbarium comprises about 60,000 sheets, and is believed to be one of 
the finest private botanical collections in existence. A detailed state- 
ment of the conditions of this deposit will be found in the earlier 
pages of this Report. 

Dr. William L. Abbott continued his generous donations of valuable 
zoological material collected by him in the East Indies. 

The accessions show a substantial increase in most classes, and in 
mollusks the number of lots received was double that of last year. 
While it is often difficult to estimate with exactness the scientific value 
of material received, the additions of the }'ear as a whole may be con- 
sidered as comparing favorably with those of previous years. The 
principal exceptions were among the lower invertebrates, where the 
accessions, though more numerous than last year, are reported to be 
much less important. The birds' eggs were 1 fewer in number and- less 
noteworthy. 

About 108,000 zoological specimens and 44,000 botanical specimens 
were received during the year. The former included about 59. < urn 
insects. Marked improvement was made in the condition of the gen- 
eral collections of mammals and reptiles. 

77 



78 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

The department is handicapped at present chiefly by the crowded 
condition of the laboratories and storage quarters and exhibition halls, 
and the want of a sufficient staff of zoological assistants in the lower 
grades. 

EXHIBITION COLLECTIONS. 

The arrangement recently made of combining all work on the exhi- 
bition series under one head continued in force during the year with 
excellent results. On account of the great amount of work required 
in connection with the exhibit for the St. Louis Exposition, however, 
the regular exhibition work was brought almost to a standstill. The 
World's Fair work continued until May, and, on account of belated 
material, one or two pieces were still in hand during the closing 
months of the year. 

The remounting of especially valuable birds in the exhibition series 
continued during the year, 13 specimens having been successfully 
treated. Shortly before its close, two new cases were provided for 4 
of the new groups of game birds, located in the entrance hall of the 
Smithsonian building. In addition, 30 other birds were mounted, 12 
dismounted, and 59 skins made up for study purposes. Fourteen 
pieces of groundwork were made for birds exhibited at St. Louis. In 
the case of birds mounted during the year, an effort was made to color 
the bills, feet, and naked portions of the skins as in life. New work 
was begun on a series of fish casts to fill cases now unoccupied. 

A brief summary of the work done for the St. Louis exhibit during 
the past two 3^ears is as follows: 

A series of large mammals representing the principal large game 
animals of the world were mounted, including such huge forms as the 
giraffe, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, polar bear, and moose. Molds 
were made in Newfoundland of an adult sulphurbottom whale, 78 feet 
long, from which a cast in paper was prepared and properly painted. 
The skeleton of a full-grown whale of this species was also obtained at 
the same place and mounted in St. Louis. Specimens representing the 
species of peacocks were mounted, together with a collection of the 
most beautiful species of pheasants. To these were added a few other 
birds of remarkable appearance or habits, and a group of the South 
American hoactzins, which are of special interest from the fact that 
the young have hooked claws oh the wings, b} 7 means of which they 
climb about from branch to branch. Casts of a large python and of 
several other interesting snakes, such as the cobra, coral snake, rattle- 
snake, etc., were prepared and painted. A series of enlarged models 
of the most grotesque or otherwise remarkable deep-sea fishes was 
prepared from specimens in the National Museum. The synoptic 
series of invertebrates belonging to the regular exhibition series of 
the Museum was renovated, enlarged, and thoroughly labeled. A 



REPORT OE ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 79 

large series of perfect specimens of the most remarkable butterflies of 
the world was assembled and arranged for exhibition in unit boxes. 
A similar series of birds' eggs, representing the largest and the most 
remarkably colored or shaped eggs were selected from the Museum 
collection and arranged on newly designed stands. A series of 
zoological objects attractive to children was prepared for the replica 
of the Smithsonian "Children's room" which was installed at St. 
Louis. The whole Museum exhibit was thoroughly labeled, with 
special reference to the requirements of an exposition. 

EXPLORATIONS. 

As mentioned in the report of last year, Mr. B. A. Bean and Mr. 
J.'H. Riley accompanied the expedition of the Baltimore Geographical 
Societ}^ to the Bahama Islands in the summer of 1903, and made con- 
siderable collections of fishes, birds, reptiles, mammals, and mollusks 
and other invertebrates. The collection of lishes added to the knowl- 
edge of the fauna of the Bahamas and many of the species represented 
in it were new to the Museum series, as was also the case with the 
corals and crustaceans. 

In the spring of 1904 Mr. William Palmer accompanied Dr. George 
P. Merrill to the State of Sinaloa, Mexico, for the purpose of making 
a mold of the great Bacubarito meteorite. While on. this expedition, 
Mr. Palmer collected a few zoological specimens of interest. 

Toward the close of the year, Dr. L. Stejneger and Mr. G. S. Miller, 
jr., were detailed to make faunal collections in the Swiss and Italian 
Alps, the object being to add to the knowledge of the life zones in that 
region. Mr. B. A. Bean and an assistant visited Beaufort, North Car- 
olina, in June and collected fishes. 

ACCESSIONS. 

The number of lots of specimens in all classes received during the 
year covered by this report was greater than last year, and in the case 
of mollusks, as already noted, almost double. Birds' e<rgs were less 
numerous and less important, and the lower invertebrates, though more 
numerous than last }^ear, were of much less interest scientifically. So 
far as plants are concerned, the accessions (numbering 555), though 
somewhat less numerous than last year, exceeded those of any other 
year since 1895. Of zoological specimens, the total number received 
was about 107,473, including about 59,000 insects. Of plants, the 
accessions aggregated 43,800 specimens, as compared with 35,000 in 
1903 and 53,500 in 1902. The purchases of plants comprised 10,000 
specimens. 

The largest transaction of the year, as regards specimens, was, as 
already mentioned, the deposit by Prof. E. L. Greene of his very 



80 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

important herbarium, comprising about 60,000 sheets, and his botan- 
ical library, numbering about 2,000 volumes. This valuable acquisi- 
tion will open new opportunities to s} T stematic botanists in the United 
States of which they will, without doubt, hasten to avail themselves. 
The details regarding this important deposit will be found in the report 
of the Assistant Secretary. 

Mrs. T. A. Williams, of Memphis, Nebraska, presented some 15,000 
plants from various localities in the United States, consisting of the 
duplicates from Mr. Williams's herbarium. She also signified her 
intention to deposit the herbarium itself, now in the George Washing- 
ton University, but the actual transfer had not been effected at the 
close of the year on account of press of other Museum business. 

Of zoological material, the largest accession was a collection of 
about 40,000 insects obtained by Messrs. Dyar, Currie, and Caudell in 
British Columbia. Next in order are the collections received through 
the Bureau of Fisheries, Department of Commerce and Labor. These 
comprised about 12,000 land and fre^h-water shells and about 670 
reptiles from Indiana and other parts of the eastern United States 
and 3,000 marine mollusks, chiefly from Alaska, preserved in alcohol. 
The Bureau also transmitted the types of a considerable number of 
recently-described fishes from the Hawaiian Islands, Japan, and other 
localities, with other specimens of fishes and also large collections of 
crustaceans and stony corals, which were obtained during the investi- 
gation of the salmon fisheries of Alaska in 1903. In addition, the 
Bureau transmitted a large series of crayfishes and shrimps from Lake 
Maxinkuckee, Indiana, collected by Dr. B. W. Evermann and assist- 
ants in 1899 and 1900, and also 461 plants collected in Alaska and 
Oregon. 

Special attention is again to be directed to the importance of the col- 
lections made by Dr. W. L. Abbott in the East Indies and veiy gener- 
ously presented by him to the National Museum. During the year 
the collections received were those from the Mentawei Archipelago, 
off the west coast of Sumatra, and from the coast and islands of eastern 
Sumatra. The mammals from the Mentawi Archipelago comprised 
about 500 specimens, including 31 new forms, among which were a 
new genus and species of gibbon, named Simias concolor by Mr. G. S. 
Miller, jr., and another new gibbon, which Mr. Miller has named 
' Symphalangia Mossi in honor of Dr. Abbott's associate, Mr. C. B. 
Kloss. The birds from the archipelago number 572 specimens, includ- 
ing several new species and many rare ones, such as the pigeon 
Columba grisea, the cuckoo Urococcyx seneicauda, etc. The collection 
from eastern Sumatra comprises 371 mammals, 202 birds, and 83 rep- 
tiles and batrachians. The mammals have not yet been identified, but 
among the birds and reptiles are known to be numerous forms not 



BEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 81 

previously represented in the National Museum and very valuable for 
comparison. Some new species are quite likely to be detected later. 

Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, added to his previous donations a 
number of valuable lots of specimens, comprising 155 mammals from 
Minnesota, 271 birds from the Philippine Islands, including 1 many 
rarities, various mollusks, and (conjointly with his son) some interest- 
ing birds' egga. 

Through an arrangement with the Baltimore Geographical Society, 
Messrs. B. A. Bean and J. H. Riley, of the Museum scientific staff, 
made an excellent miscellaneous zoological collection in the Bahama 
Islands, including many desiderata, especiall} r among fishes. Of the 
110 species of fishes obtained, many were previously unknown as 
belonging to the fauna of the Bahamas or were unrepresented in the 
national collections. Of mammals, 181 specimens were obtained, of 
which one species was undescribed; of birds, 15(3 specimens, including 
a new subspecies of night hawk and the second known specimen of 
the woodpecker Cmturusnyeanus; of reptiles, 73 specimens, including 
a new large iguana, described by Dr. L. Stejneger. under the name of 
Cyclura rileyi. 

The Biological Survey, U. S. Department of Agriculture, trans- 
mitted some valuable birds' eggs and a collection of 377 reptiles from 
Texas, the result of several years' collecting and the basis of a paper 
by Mr. Vernon Bailey on the reptile fauna of the "State. One new 
species of lizard in this collection was described by Doctor Stejneger 
under the name of Sceloporus merriami. 

Capt. Wirt Robinson, U. S. Army, presented a collection of bats 
from Cuba and a number of interesting birds. Some 215 birds, a col- 
lection of land shells, and about 3,000 insects, together with 31 mam- 
mals, from the mountains of Venezuela were purchased from Mr. M. 
S. Briceiio. Among the former were many rare humming-birds. 

A collection of 56 bats and 323 birds from Barbuda and Antigua 
islands was purchased from Mr. H. Selw} T n Branch. The birds repre- 
sent the fauna of these islands with a great degree of completeness, 
and comprise several forms not previously known to occur there, as 
well as a new species of warbler. 

Mammals. — Besides the specimens included in the foregoing miscel- 
laneous collections, mention should be made of a number of accessions 
consisting solely of mammals. Mr. E. O. Wooton, of Mesilla Park, 
New Mexico, presented the second known specimen of a remarkable 
bat belonging to the fauna of the United States, known as Euderma 
maculatum. 

A jaguar killed in Texas was purchased from Mr. H. P. Attwater. 
This is the first authentic specimen of the jaguar from the United 

NAT mus 190-4 6 



82 KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

States, though the range of the species was considered as including 
the southern part of that State. 

A specimen of the very rare mouse-deer, Tragulus stanleyanus, was 
purchased from M. Emile Deschamps. 

A miscellaneous collection of^Old World mammals, including repre- 
sentatives of two new species, was purchased from Mr. W. Schli'iter. 

A collection of Japanese mammals was purchased from Mr. T. 
Tsuchida. A large collection of bats from Vera Cruz, Mexico, was 
purchased, and by exchange with the British Museum six exception- 
ally rare bats, belonging to genera not represented in the national 
collection, were acquired. By exchange with the American Museum 
of Natural History, a collection of 51 Colombian mammals was obtained. 

Birds. — In addition to the birds presented by Doctors Abbott and 
Mearns, and those acquired from the Biological Survey and the Balti- 
more Geographical Society above mentioned, a few other especially 
interesting accessions deserve notice. Mr. Homer Davenport, of East 
Orange, New Jersey, presented 20 3 7 oung pheasants. Pheasants in 
these early stages, which are valuable in the study of the arrangement 
of feathers, are difficult to obtain. Mr. N. C. Brown, of Portland, 
Maine, presented an especially well-prepared series of 267 birds from 
South Carolina. By exchange with the Philippine Museum, at Manila, 
an excellent series of well-prepared Philippine birds, comprising about 
200 specimens, was obtained. Four species of birds-of -paradise not 
previous^ represented in the national collection were purchased, as 
well as 215 specimens of birds from the mountains of Venezuela, com- 
prising several species neAv to the Museum and including man}^ speci- 
mens valuable for comparison in connection with the work on "Birds 
of North and Middle America." Some of the humming-birds in this 
collection are rare in museums. 

Of birds' eggs, Dr. W. L. Ralph added many interesting specimens 
to his previous donations, and some excellent specimens were presented 
by Gen. J. W. Barlow. A collection of rare Mexican eggs and 13 
eggs of the hoactzin, also very rare, were purchased. 

Reptiles. — Dr. Hugh M. Smith, Deput} r Commissioner of Fisheries, 
presented a collection of 158 reptiles which he collected in Japan. 
This material has been of much service to Doctor Stejneger, who is 
engaged in preparing a work on the reptile fauna of Japan. Mr. E. J. 
Brown, of Lemon City, Florida, presented 17 rare reptiles from south- 
ern Florida, among which were specimens of a new species of spread- 
ing adder, described by Doctor Stejneger under the name of Ileterodon 
hrovMti. 

Fishes. — The Stanford University presented 10 lots of fishes from 
Japan, comprising t} T pes and cotypes of species collected and described 
by Dr. David S. Jordan and Mr. Snyder. One lot of excellently-pre- 
pared fishes from Puget Sound was presented by Dr. J. C. Thompson, 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 83 

U. S. Navy. In order to replenish the collection with fresh material 
and to obtain duplicate specimens for distribution, Messrs. Bean and 
McKnew, as already mentioned, visited Beaufort, North Carolina. 
The}' obtained a large series of specimens. A specimen of the rare 
Japanese shark, Mitsukurina owstont, 11 feet long, was purchased. 

MollwJcs. — Rev. L. T. Chamberlain presented a small collection of 
rare river mussels, or Unionidse, for addition to extensive earlier con- 
tributions. About 2,500 specimens of several species of western 
American shells were presented by Dr. R. E. C. Stearns, honorary 
associate in zoology. Mr. E. J. Court, of Washington City, con- 
tributed a series of about 2,000 land shells from Maryland, Virginia, 
and the District of Columbia. From Mr. H. W. Henshaw, of Hilo, 
Hawaii, was received a very acceptable lot of about 600 Hawaiian land 
shells, together with a number of other invertebrates. Mr. Dwight 
Blaney presented some 300 shells dredged near Mount Desert, Maine, 
and Mr. C. A. Davis a series of specimens, representing about 72 
species, from Bermuda, including cotypes of several forms described 
by the donor. The Museum received as a gift from Mr. H. N. Lowe 
and Mrs. Blanche Trask, of California, some small lots of very accept- 
able Californian shells, which were needed to fill gaps in the series. 

Several purchases of mollusks were made during the year in addi- 
tion to the lot from the mountains of Venezuela referred to. Among 
these should be mentioned a series of about' 2,500 Japanese land and 
marine mollusks, representing 487 species; a large series of unusually 
rare or beautiful land shells, comprising 252 species; a fine Vblttta 
pulchra, and a large collection of land shells from the coast and islands 
of California. The latter was obtained from Mr. Henry Hemphill, 
and is commented on by Doctor Dall as follows: 

The series sent by Mr. Hemphill is nearly 50 per cent larger than was called for 
by the agreement, and may to that extent be regarded as almost a donation. The 
material comprises a thoroughly representative series showing the various mutations, 
varieties, and species in which the coast is so rich, including the pleistocene forms 
when they occur, and illustrating in a remarkable manner the flexibility of what have 
been regarded as species. There were in all 649 lots of specimens, representing as 
many distinct varieties or mutations. 

Lower invertebrates. — A collection of sea-urchins, chieify from the 
Gulf of Siam and the Ingolf dredgings, was obtained by exchange 
from the Zoological Museum, Copenhagen, Denmark. Dr. K. Kishi- 
nouye presented 11 specimens of four species of Japanese precious 
coral, showing the different varieties. Three of the specimens were 
cotypes of forms described by Doctor Kishinouye. The National 
Museum of Brazil presented cotypes of the shrimp JVephrops rubettus, 
and of the stomatopod crustacean Pseudosquilla braziliensu. Mr. 
H. N. Lowe, of Long Beach, California, presented a collection of 
crustaceans from Catalina and San Clemente islands, among which

were found two new species and several rare ones. In a small collec- 
tion of Mexican fresh-water crabs received from the U. S. Biological 
Survey, one new species was discovered. Specimens of an undescribed 
species of isopod crustacean, and of Branchipus, were presented by 
Mr. George E. Morris, of Waltham, Massachusetts. Through exchange 
with the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 
five specimens (four species) of crabs from the Hawaiian Islands, all 
new to the Museum collection and two new to science, were obtained. 
By purchase from Emile Deschamps, San Jose, California, the Museum 
procured miscellaneous invertebrates from Shanghai,' a locality scarcely 
at all represented in our collections. 

In*, <is. — The accessions of insects numbered 377, comprising 58,953 
specimens, as compared with 250 accessions, comprising 37,684 speci- 
mens, last year, a gratifying increase both in number and in quality of 
material. 

Mr. E. A. Schwarz added to the donations of previous years a col- 
lection of 6,300 Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, etc., from Texas. Prof. 
T. D. A. Cockerell presented a large collection of insects from Colo- 
rado and 325 specimens from New Mexico. Mr. C. F. Baker, of 
Claremont, California, presented a large collection of Diptera. The 
members of the Washington Biologists' Field Club who are interested 
in entomolog}" collected and presented to the Museum about 3,400 
miscellaneous insects from the grounds of the club at Plummers 
Island, Maryland. A valuable collection of Lepidoptera from British 
Columbia was presented by Mr. E. M. Anderson, of the Provincial 
Museum, Victoria. Two large collections of British Columbia insects, 
comprising in all about 40,000 specimens, were collected lyy Messrs. 
Dyar, Currie, and Caudell. 

A miscellaneous collection of Peruvian insects was presented by 
Mrs. M. J. Pusey, of Callao, Peru, and Mr. Edward A. Klages 
donated a collection of Venezuelan beetles. Two excellent series of 
Japanese Hymenoptera were the gift of Prof. S. Matsamura, of Sap- 
poro. Two collections from India deserve notice here — a series of 
Hymenoptera presented lyy Maj. C. G. Nurse, and a series of spiders 
presented by Prof. N. Jambunathan. Sir George Hampson, of the 
British Museum, presented a collection of Norwegian Lepidoptera. 

Four lots of Philippine insects were donated by the Rev. W. A. 
Stanton, of Manila. Another Philippine collection of importance was 
received as a gift from Mr. R. C. McGregor, Of the Philippine 
Museum, Manila. 

The Washington Agricultural College presented, through Prof. C. 
V. Piper, a large collection of Diptera, containing t} 7 pes of Tipulidse 
described by Mr. Doane. A collection of Diptera containing types 
of Poridae was presented by Mr. C. T. Brues, of Paris, Texas. Twelve

cotypes of species of spiders were th% gift of Mr. Theodore Scheffer, 
of Manhattan, Kansas. 

Among the purchases of the year were three important lots of South 
American insects, including one from Paraguay and one from Vene- 
zuela; also a miscellaneous collection from Australia. 

The U. S. Department of Agriculture transmitted two lots of mis- 
cellaneous insects comprising 6,054 specimens, of which 4,500 were 
collected by Mr. E. A. Schwarz in Cuba. 

Plants. — The accessions to the National Herbarium during the year 
numbered 555, which is considerably above the average for the last 
thirteen years, though somewhat exceeded last year. The specimens 
numbered 43,800, or about 9,000 more than last year. The deposit of 
Professor Greene's herbarium and the large accession from Mrs. T. A. 
Williams have already been mentioned (pp. 7i», SO). Following these 
should probably be placed the accessions from the Philippine insular 
bureau of agriculture, Manila, which aggregate 3,360 specimens. 
.These were received in exchange. Other important exchanges with 
the New York Botanical Garden, resulting in the acquisition of 1,317 
specimens, were effected during the year. These were from Jamaica 
and other islands of the West Indies, and from Colorado. By exchange 
with the Ro3 r al Botanical Gardens, Kew, London, 278 plants from 
Europe, India, and other Old World regions were obtained. Mr. C. V. 
Piper, of Pullman, Washington, presented 658 plants from that State. 
An interesting collection from Mexico, comprising 139 specimens, 
was presented b}^ Mr. E. W. D. Holway, of Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
Mr. William Palmer, of the Museum staff, collected 328 plants in 
Newfoundland while engaged in making molds of a whale at the 
Balena whaling station. 

About 10,000 plants were purchased from outside the United States. 
The series acquired in this manner were 773 specimens from Australia, 
1,606 specimens from Mexico, 471 from Nicaragua, and 109 from Costa 
Rica. Important purchases of plants of the United States were as 
follows: Utah, Wyoming, and Nevada, 1,402; California, 1,269; Vir- 
ginia, 325; Texas and Arkansas, 280; Florida, 212; Oregon, 201. 

The national herbarium received from the Department of Agricul- 
ture 68 accessions, comprising 1,870 specimens, among which the most 
important were the collections made in Texas by Mr. Arthur Howell 
(74 specimens), by Mr. Fred G. Plummer in New Mexico and Okla- 
homa (97 specimens), and by Mr. Vernon Bailey, also in New Mexico 
(165 specimens). 

The plants transmitted by the Bureau of Fisheries have been men- 
tioned (see p. 80). They comprise 461 specimens collected in Alaska 
and Oregon b}^ Messrs. Gilbert, Evermann, Chamberlain, and others. 



86 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

WORK ON THE STUDY SERIES. 

In the division of mammals the two principal operations which 
tend toward the preservation and improvement of the great series of 
specimens reserved for the use of svstematic zoologists are the clean- 
ing of skulls and the renovation of skins which have deteriorated on 
account of the presence of oily matter or from other causes. During 
the year 1903-4, 6,760 skulls were cleaned, or about 2,700 more than 
in the preceding year. Somewhat more than two-thirds of these skulls 
belong to the collection of the Biological Survej^, U. S. Department of 
Agriculture. At the end of the year, 3,000 small and 1,200 large 
skulls were on hand, for which no contract for cleaning had been 
made. The importance of this work is due to the fact that at the 
present time genera and species of mammals are founded largely on 
cranial characters and measurements, which can only be determined 
satisfactory after the skulls have been entirely stripped of the soft 
parts surrounding or attached to them. 

During the year, 289 skins of the smaller species were made over 
and put in order, and 73 large skins, such as those of deer, antelopes, 
bears, etc., these being cleaned and tanned. 

The condition of the collection as a whole is excellent, but as no 
new cases for small species were provided no improvement could be 
made in the systematic arrangement of the material. The large skins 
are now arranged systematically, but are much overcrowded. Dur- 
ing the year the space behind the large exhibition case in the east side 
of the west hall, about 90 feet in length, was fitted with 274 trays, 
and the large skulls which are kept there were arranged in systematic 
order, so that the material is now available. The labeling and arrange- 
ment of the alcoholic series was completed during the year, and that 
part of the collection is in excellent condition. 

In the division of birds, on account of lack of assistance and over- 
crowded quarters, no special progress could be made in improving 
the general condition of the study series, but many type-specimens 
were newly labeled, obscure species identified, etc. Some 650 birds 
sent to the Museum for naming during the year by various institu- 
tions and individuals were properly identified, a task which consumed 
much time. A large amount of material, comprising about 3,500 
specimens, was borrowed for use by Mr. R. Ridgway in connection 
with his manual of North and Middle American birds. 

The collection of birds' eggs is reported to be in better condition 
than ever before. The arrangement of the nests and eggs was much 
improved during the year. 

The study collection of reptiles and batrachians is in a satisfactory 
condition and the systematic arrangement progressed favorably dur- 
ing the year, though on account of insufficient space many difficulties 



'report of assistant secretary. 87 

are encountered. The entering- of the specimens returned to the 
Museum from the estate of E. D. Cope was completed. 

In the division of fishes, the regular routine occupied most of the 
time. The equipment was improved by the addition of some new 
tanks, and a number of type-specimens were rebottled and placed with 
the special series of types. 

In the division of mollusks, the arrangement of several families 
was revised, and a separate series was established for the fauna of 
the District of Columbia. The collection as a whole is reported as 
thoroughly accessible and in a good state of preservation. 

The honorary curator of the division of insects, Dr. L. O. How- 
ard, reports as follows regarding the insect collections: 

The insect collections were never before so admirably arranged or so well pre- 
served as they are to-day. This is due principally to the liberality shown the Divi- 
sion in furnishing so many of the standard insect drawers, and the specialists are 
now arranging the several orders as rapidly as possible in these drawers. 

Doctor Dyar continues his excellent work in naming, arranging, and increasing the 
Lepidoptera, and deserves special mention for the great work he is doing for this 
order. It is mainly due to him that the national collection of these insects is now so 
large and in such splendid systematic order. 

Mr. E. A. Schwarz, of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, is another who has 
contributed more than anyone else to increasing the insect collections in all orders. 
The Coleoptera, now under his charge, are probably not surpassed in any other 
museum in this country. 

Mr. D. W. Coquillett, of the Department of Agriculture, continues his work on the 
Diptera and has made many additions to the collection of the past year. The Culi- 
cida?, or the mosquitoes, in the collection are worthy of special mention, as they have 
been enormously increased the past year in all stages of their development — from 
egg to wings — and the collection of these insects in the National Museum is probably 
unequaled in any other museum, except the British Museum. 

Mr. Kolla P. Currie, during the present year, has been fully occupied in superin- 
tending and perfecting the collection of insects sent to the St. Louis Exposition, and 
should receive credit for the excellence of that exhibit. Such time, however, as he 
could spare from this and other work he has devoted to the Neuropteroid insects — 
Odonata, Neuroptera, and Trichoptera — and the collections of these insects will 
before a great while be in excellent order and arranged in the standard insect 
drawers. 

Mr. A. N. Caudell, of the Department of Agriculture, has done some excellent 
work in arranging the Orthoptera, removed last year to Doctor Dyar's room, and now 
virtually under his charge. 

Doctor Ashmead continues his work on the Hymenoptera, and in the coming year 
hopes to have the whole order arranged in the standard insect drawers. He has 
published his generic revision of the order, except the ants, or the superfamily 
Formicoidea. The generic revision of the ants will probably be completed this 
autumn. He has also worked up all the Japanese and Philippine Hymenoptera now 
in the National Museum, and papers on these subjects will appear in the Proceedings 
of the Museum. 

The great order Rhynchota still remains without a specialist to take care of it, 
and almost nothing has been done toward arranging and determining the rich collec- 
tion of these insects now in the Museum. 



88 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

In the division of marine invertebrates, a special cataloguer was 
employed for two and one-half months in bringing up the records of 
various series, especially the Hawaiian crabs and shrimps, the amphi- 
pods of the New England coast, identified by Dr. S. J. Holmes, and 
the isopods obtained during the investigation of the salmon fisheries 
of Alaska by the Bureau of Fisheries in 1903. Fifty-one sets of 
duplicates, each containing about 200 specimens, were distributed, 
together with several special sets of few specimens each. 

As the Helminthological collections are without separate permanent 
quarters, no special action was taken in connection with them beyond 
the care required to keep them in good condition. They constitute, 
according to the custodian, Dr. C. W. Stiles, the finest collection for 
study purposes in the country. 

The work done in the national herbarium is reported on as follows 
by Mr. F. V. Coville, honorary curator: 

During the year we have added 64 standard insect-proof cases, making 312 now in 
use. In addition, we have added 5 half-units, making 12 now in use. Beside these, 
We have had constructed 17 three- fourths-unit cases, for storage purposes only. 
This gives us a total of 7,938 pigeonholes. No insects have been observed in these 
cases during the last six months, although they have been very bad in other parts 
of the herbarium. The entire herbarium is now stored in insect-proof cases, except 
the following groups: Lower cryptogams ( exclusive of alga'), the ferns and fern allies 
and the coniferge. 

Practically all the specimens which have been mounted during the year have been 
stamped and recorded. The number of specimens stamped and incorporated in 
the permanent herbarium since its transfer to the National Herbarium on July 1, 
1894, is 241,000. Of these, 21,000 have been added the past year. 

Owing to our small force, only a little work has been done toward stamping and 
recording the old part of the herbarium. Our record shows only 429 of these speci- 
mens stamped, all of which were loaned for study. 

The specimens are recorded in large books, each one of which contains space for 
5,000 names. Thirty-five of these have been closed and 13 are still open. Seven 
new books were opened during the year. 

The following table shows the number of plants mounted during the last few 
years, exclusive of the lower cryptogams: 

1898-99 22, 556 

1899-1900 22, 272 

1900-1901 • 18, 117 

1901-02 18, 000 

1902-03 21, 076 

1903-04 29, 700 

The number of specimens mounted, as is here shown, is 29,700. This is the 
largest number mounted during the last six years. This large number is due to the 
fact that some $400 was transferred to our account, which was used in mounting 
specimens. Of these plants, 21,900 were mounted by contract at a costjof $876, while 
3,350 were mounted by the Department of Agriculture. 

The rearrangement of the herbarium according to the Engler and Prantl sequence, 
to which reference was made in the last two annual reports, has been continued. 
The work has continued from near the end of family No. 105, the Crucifene, to the 
beginning of family No. 246, Gentianaceae. 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 89 

COOPERATION OF SPECIALISTS AND LOAN OF COLLECTIONS. 

The Museum continued, as in previous years, the custom of lending 
specimens to specialists engaged in scientific investigations. The 
activity in this direction among mammalogists was about the same as 
last } 7 ear. Seventeen lots, comprising 31*> specimens, were sent out to 
eight persons. Among the specimens were live types. The principal 
loan consisted of 244 bats, which were sent to Mr. J. A. G. Rehn, of 
Philadelphia, who is engaged in the study of the American species of 
this order. Among the remaining classes of vertebrates the transac- 
tions of this kind were less numerous, amounting in all to nine or ten 
lots, comprising somewhat more than 50 specimens. 

The loans of insects and lower invertebrates were far more numer- 
ous, amounting to more than 5,500 specimens in the case of the former. 
Among them the most extensive were 1,914 Coleoptera, sent to Dr. 
F. E. Blaisdell, of San Francisco, California; 1,709 Orthoptera to Mr. 
J. A. G. Rehn, of Philadelphia; 4!>3 Rhynchota to Prof. P. R. Uhler, 
of Baltimore; and 440 Diptera, of the family Tabanida?, to Prof. 
James S. Hine, of the Ohio State University. Columbus, Ohio. 

The collections of marine invertebrates made during the investiga- 
tion of the salmon fishery of Alaska by the Bureau of Fisheries in 1903, 
were sent to the following specialists for identification and report: 
Siphonostoma to Prof. Charles B. Wilson; Pycnogonida to Dr. Leon 
J. Cole; Schizopoda to Dr. A. E. Ortmann; Amphipoda to Dr. S. J. 
Holmes; Cirripedia to Prof. H. A. Pilsbry. Doctor Ortmann also 
received the Schizopoda collected by the Bureau of Fisheries steamer 
Alhatroax in 1891, for use in connection with the report on the collection 
of 1902. A number of starfishes from Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean 
were sent to Prof. A. E. Verrill for use in connection with his report on 
the starfishes of the Harriman Alaska Expedition. Several lots of 
actinians were sent to Dr. J. E. Duerden, who is preparing a report 
for the Bureau of Fisheries on the forms found in the Hawaiian 
Islands, and also on species held in the claws of certain crabs. Fifty 
bottles of surface towings from the Woods Hole region were sent to 
Dr. K. W. Genthe, from which to sort out copepod crustaceans for a 
report on that group. 

The general collection of Cumacea was forwarded to Dr. W. T. 
Caiman of the British Museum for study. 

Loans of plants from the National Herbarium were about as numer- 
ous as last year, comprising 43 lots, containing 2,873 sheets, as com- 
pared with 35 lots, containing 2,704 sheets, sent out in 1902-03. The 
principal loans were as follows: 

To Dr. Janet Perkins, at the Berlin Botanical Garden, 1,150 Philip- 
pine plants; to Dr. B. L. Robinson, (nay Herbarium, Harvard Uni- 
versity, 423 sheets of Mexican plants and specimens of Xyris and 



90 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Polygonum ; to Dr. Theo. Holm, Brookland, District of Columbia, 277 
sheets of Ca/rex, Betula, Lychnis, etc.; to Mr. George R. Shaw, 
Arnold Arboretum, Jamaica Plains, Massachusetts, 212 specimens of 
pines; to Mr. Oakes Ames, 219 specimens of orchids. 

DISTRIBUTION OF SURPLUS MATERIAL. 

As already stated, 51 sets of duplicate specimens of marine inver- 
tebrates were distributed during- the year. These sets contain about 
200 specimens each, representing from 92 to 99 species, and as many 
different groups as the nature of the material available permits. Of 
the 10,000 or more specimens, somewhat less than one-half went to 
high schools, and the remainder to various other public schools, 
and to universities, colleges, academies, seminaries, institutes, and 
museums. Eighteen States are represented in this distribution. 

LABORATORY USE OF THE COLLECTIONS BY INVESTIGATORS. 

The bird collections have been very frequently consulted during the 
year by ornithologists from different parts of the country. The col- 
lections from the Western States were examined by Mrs. Vernon 
Bailey, of Washington City, who is revising her handbook of western 
birds. The bluebirds and crested flycatchers were studied \>y Mr. 
E. W. Nelson, of the Biological Survey, in connection with a list of 
Mexican birds which he is preparing. Mr. H. C. Oberholser, of the 
same Bureau, made almost daily use of the collection in connection 
with his official work, and also for identifying birds sent in by various 
correspondents, and in preparing a report for the Museum on Doctor 
Abbott's collection from Mount Kilima-njaro, East Africa. Prof. 
W. W. Cooke, another ornithologist of the Survey, examined the 
North American series in connection with his study of migrations. 
The entire stud}^ series was examined by Dr. R. M. Strong, of the 
University of Chicago, on points connected with his researches on 
the structure and color of feathers. The Nomenclature Committee of 
the American Ornithologists' Union considered the validity of various 
species and subspecies of North American birds as represented in the 
collection. Dr. Jonathan Dwight, jr., examined the collection of 
North American gulls. 

In the division of reptiles, Mr. W. P. Hay was given facilities for 
studying specimens of the diamond-back terrapins, on which he is pre- 
paring a report for the Bureau of Fisheries. Mr. Vernon Bailey spent 
several weeks in stud}dng the reptiles of Texas. 

The collection of fishes was frequently consulted by the ichtlryolo- 
gists of the Bureau of Fisheries, especially Messrs. Evermann, Kendall, 
Goldsborough, and Pope. 

Mr. Ralph Arnold made a study of the Western American Pectinida?, 
in connection with a monograph of the group which he has in contem- 



EEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 91 

plation. Col. Thomas L. Caesy, U. S. Army, made an investigation 

of the fossil and recent Pleurotonidse for a classification of that family. 

Regarding- the insect collections. Doctor Howard reports as follows: 

Prof. J. B. Smith, of New Brunswick, New Jersey, W. D. Kearfott, of New York, 
Dr. W. J. Holland, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, Win. Schaus, London, England, and 
others, have consulted the collection of Lepidoptera; John H. Emerton, of Boston, 
and Prof. R. V. Chamberlain, of Cornell University, made use of the collection of 
Arachnidse; C. Schaeffer, of Brooklyn, Dr. Henry Skinner, of Philadelphia, and 
others, have made studies on our Coleoptera; several physicians have examined our 
collection of mosquito larva\ The Carnegie Institute has also had the use of our 
PoliMse for the purpose of illustrating a paper on the American species. 

Regarding investigation carried on in the national herbarium, Mr. 
Coville reports as follows: 

Dr. E. L. Greene, of the Catholic University of America, has spent much time 
here engaged on various lines of systematic work. Dr. N. L. Britton, director of the 
New York Botanical Garden, has been a frequent visitor, being engaged with .Mr. 
Rose in preparing a monograph of the North American genera of Crassulacese, which 
will soon be published. Mr. Theo. Holm, of Brookland, District of Columbia, has 
frequently been here to examine our Carices. He has frequently borrowed material 
to take to his home, and we have had specimens sent on here for him to study. We 
have endeavored to give him every facility to carry on his work and to grant all 
requests consistent-with the Museum rules and regulations. Prof. E. L. Morris, of the 
Washington High School, has been studying the genus Plantago, doing much of his 
work at the herbarium. We have borrowed several collections for him from other 
institutions. 

The following persons from the Department of Agriculture, in addition to those 
officially connected with the Division, have frequently consulted the herbarium: 
Mr. L. H. Dewey, Mr. V. K. Chestnut, Mr. W. F. Wight, Mr. C. L. Sheer, Mr. C. R. 
Ball, Mr. P. L. Ricker, Mr. C. F. Wheeler, Mr. C. V. Piper, Mr. Scofield. 

SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHES AND INVESTIGATIONS. 

While the preparations for the St. Louis Exposition occupied a 
portion of the time of nearly every member of the scientific staff, on 
the other hand the separate management of the exhibition work by a 
chief designated for that purpose more than compensated for the diver- 
sion. The scientific work accomplished during the year, therefore, 
showed no important diminution as compared with that of previous 
years. A complete list of papers published will be found under the 
heading ' ' Bibliography ". 

Work on the manual of the Birds of North and Middle America was 
continued by Mr. Ridgway without interruption during the year. 
Part 1 of this work was published in 1901 and part 2 in 1902. Part 3 
was printed to page 172 and the manuscript for the remainder com- 
pleted and sent to press. Of part 1, more than TOO pages of manuscript 
were made ready for the printer, and the work beyond that point is well 
in hand. Mr. Ridgway was assisted after January 1, 1901, by Mr. J . H. 
Riley, who prepared the necessary tables of measurements, etc. 



92 KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Mr. Ridgway also published during the year two papers containing 
descriptions of 1 new genera and 29 new species and subspecies of 
American birds. 

Lists of the birds collected by Doctor Abbott and Mr. C. P. Kloss 
on Anambas and Tambelans islands, China Sea, and at Tringanu, Malay 
Peninsula, were prepared by Doctor Richmond and sent to Mr. Kloss 
at his request. Doctor Richmond also completed the majority of 
identifications of the birds collected b}^ Doctor Abbott on the islands 
off the west coast of Sumatra and published live notes on matters of 
zoological nomenclature. 

Mr. J. H. Riley published three notes on birds of the Bahama 
Islands, including a description of a new nighthawk. 

Dr. F. W. True submitted the manuscript of his memoir of the 
Whalebone Whales of the Western North Atlantic for publication, 
and at the close of the year the entire work, consisting of about :'><>() 
pages, with 50 plates, had passed through the press. During the year 
he published four papers on cetaceans and a number of articles for the 
Encyclopedia Americana. 

The study of Doctor Abbott's collections of mammals from the 
Malay Archipelago was continued by Mr. G. S. Miller, jr., during 
the year. He published descriptions of 70 new species from these 
collections, including a new genus and (> new species of monkeys. 'J. 
new species of mouse-deer (T/'at/u/t/x), and l> new species of flying 
lemurs (Galeopithecus), etc. He published also descriptions of -i 
additional species of Old World mammals, a note on the bat Euderma 
maculatwri, and a paper on bats collected by Mr. William Palmer in 
Cuba. In addition, Mr. Miller continued work on a reclassification of 
the Cheiroptera. Dr. M. W. Lyon completed his study of the osteology 
of the hares and their allies, mentioned in last year's report, and pub- 
lished an elaborate revision of the genera and subgenera, based on 
osteological characters. 

Doctor Stejneger's Herpetology of Porto Rico was published during 
the year in the Museum report for 1902. It is a comprehensive work 
of 175 pages, with numerous illustrations. Doctor Stejneger con- 
tinued his investigation of the reptile fauna of eastern Asia, and also 
worked up the collections obtained by Dr. Hugh M. Smith in Japan 
and by Mr. J. II. Riley in the Bahama Islands. The latter contained 
a new species of iguana, which was named Gyclura rileyi by Doctor 
Stejneger. He also published a description of a new snake from 
Florida and a new lizard from Texas, together with a report on the 
Fifth Zoological Congress, to which he was delegate. 

A report on the fishes collected in the Bahama Islands by Mr. B. A. 
Bean for the Baltimore Geographical Society was prepared by him for 
the society. It included a list of 165 species, with notes on their 
habits, abundance, and uses. Mr. Bean also identified the collection 



KEPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. . 93 

of fishes of the Nile made by the Senff Expedition of 1899, and published 
notes on collections from North Carolina and the Barbados. 

Dr. William H. Dall completed reviews of the nomenclature of the 
Pupacea and of the history and classification of the Tritons and Frog- 
shells, and also a summary of the recent and fossil land-shell fauna 
of the Bahamas. He also began a general review of the land and fresh- 
water shells of Alaska and adjoining regions in Asia and North 
America. His publications on recent mollusks for the year consisted 
of descriptions of 13 new species from California, a new genus of 
Trochidse from Hawaii, three notes on nomenclature, a note on the 
family Septidse, and one on the relations of Gundlachia and Ancylus. 
He also published conjointly with Mr. Paul Bartsch the chapter on 
the Pyramidellidse in Mr. Ralph Arnold's Paleontolog}- of San Pedro, 
California, a synopsis of the genera of the same family, a revision of 
ArnpuEaria, and a description of a new California species of Peri- 
ploma. 

Mr. Bartsch continued work on the Pyramidellidse, as noted in last 
year's report, and published descriptions of new species of Scissurella 
and So, mi; Ha. a note on Limax, and also an account of the herons 
living in the District of Columbia. 

The bibliography of the staff of the Division of Insects (including 
the honorary officers) for the year comprises 111 titles. It is obvi- 
ously impossible to mention so large a number in detail in this place, 
but a full list will be found under "Bibliography' 1 . Dr. L. O. 
Howard published 16 papers, including one in the Yearbook of the 
Department of Agriculture for 1903 on silk culture. Doctor Ash- 
niead's papers number 20, the most extensive being a classification of 
the Chalcid flies, based partly on the collection of the National Museum 
and published by the Carnegie Museum of Pittsburg. It consists of 
326 pages and !» plates. Dr. H. (J. Dyar's entomological publications 
for the year number 31, among them being a paper of 160 pages on 
the Lepidoptera of the Kootenai District of British Columbia. Mr. 
D. W. Coquillett published 15 papers, including descriptions of new 
genera and species in Mrs. C. F. Baker's reports on the Diptera of 
California. Mr. Nathan Banks's publications on spiders were of equal 
number; among them one on Pliasmidae of 23 pages, the spiders of 
Florida, containing a list of 27'.» species, of which 13 were new (28 pp.). 

Mr. Caudell published 11 papers, among them one on the Wal king- 
sticks (Phasmidse) of the United States (23 pp.), containing descrip- 
tions of a new subfamily, three new genera, and four new species. 
Mr. R. P. Currie published an account of an insect-collecting trip in 
British Columbia (11 pp.) and two other papers. 

Dr. J. E. Benedict's revision of the crustaceans of the genus 
Lepidopa, mentioned in last year's report, was published in the Pro- 
ceedings of the Museum, and he has continued his studies of the

anomurans and published a paper on new albuneids. Miss M. J. 
Rathbun's monograph of the fresh-water crabs (Potamonidse) was 
completed and is in course of publication in the Archives of the 
Paris Museum of Natural History. She also continued work on 
the Hawaiian crabs. Her report on the decapod crustaceans of the 
northwest coast of North America (190 pp.) was published in the 
Harriman Alaska Expedition series. A report on isopod crustaceans 
of this region by Dr. Harriet Richardson was included in the same 
volume. Doctor Richardson published two other papers on isopods 
during the year. 

Dr. C. W. Stiles, custodian of the helminthological collection, 
completed his investigation of the hookworm disease in the Southern 
States, and undertook an investigation of the "spotted fever." He 
published two papers relating to parasites, and, in cooperation with 
Dr. Albert Hassall, the fourth, fifth, and sixth parts of an index 
catalogue of medical and veterinary zoology. 

The titles of papers published by Dr. F. V. Coville, honorary 
curator of the national herbarium, are given in the Bibliography (Ap- 
pendix III of this Report). Dr. J. N. Rose continued the study of the 
Crassulacese, and expects soon to publish a monograph of that family 
conjointly with Dr. N. L. Britton. One preliminary paper on the 
family by these authors appeared during the year, in which eleven 
new genera and a large number of new species were described. 
Doctor Rose also published a description of a new species of Begonia. 
He was invited to join Doctor Britton in a work on the cactuses of 
North America, the investigations for which will occup} r some four or 
five years. Mr. W. R. Maxon gave some time to the study of the 
ferns of the Philippine Islands.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY 
FOR THE YEAR 1903-04. 

By George P. Merrill, 
Head Curator. 

The year 1903-04 compares favorably with those immediately pre- 
ceding it in both the number and value of accessions. Indeed, when 
that acquired for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition is taken into 
consideration, the value of exhibition material received exceeds that of 
either of the two previous years. As, however, much of this has not 
yet been installed in the Museum collections, its full value can not be 
made apparent. 

ACCESSIONS. 

The total number of accessions received by the Department is shown 
in tabular form below, those of 1902-03 being also given for purposes 
of comparison:

DIVISION OF GEOLOGY. 



1. A series of 102 specimens of platiniferous rocks from the Demi- 
dotf Mines, Russia; gift of M. Juarez Sponville. 

2. A magnificent mass of amethystine quartz, weighing some 4<><> 
pounds, from the extraordinary geode discovered a few years since in 
Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and described b} r Dr. G. F. Kunz in the 
Mineral Resources for 1901. 

3. A series comprising 78 specimens of rocks, illustrating the occur- 
rence and association of the diamond at the De Beers Consolidated 
Mines, Kimberley, South Africa. These came to the Museum as a 
gift from Mr. Gardner F. Williams, the manager of the mines, and 
the author of the work The Diamond Mines of South Africa.

98 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

•Jr. A series of 22 specimens of copper and its associations from 
Calumet, Michigan. 

5. A large slab of polished rose quartz, some 33 by 39 by 5 inches, 
frojm the Black Hills of South Dakota. 

6. A beautiful nugget of native silver; gift of Mr. A. L. Pellegrin, 
Nogales. Arizona. 

7. A sample of diamond-bearing gravel with small diamond attached 
from Minas Geraes, Brazil; gift of Prof. O. A. Derby. 

In addition, mention should be made of a fine series of opalized 
wood from near Logan, Montana, and a unique series of silicified gey- 
ser tubes from southwestern Wyoming (both collected for the Louisi- 
ana Purchase Exposition by the Head Curator); some large slabs of 
the peculiar porphyritic rock known as leopardite from near Salisbury, 
North Carolina, and of orbicular diorite from near Advance, in the 
same State; also of the various quadrangle series, comprising some 
385 specimens, received from the U. S. Geological Survey. 

DIVISION OP MINERALOGY. 

1. The largest accession of the year comprised some 600 specimens 
illustrating the occurrence and association of zeolites and other sili- 
cates in the trap rocks of New Jersey. The collection is remarkably 
complete and valuable for both study and exhibition purposes. It 
came to the Museum through the instrumentality of Dr. William S. 
Disbrow, of Newark, New Jersej r , to whom we have been indebted for 
much interesting material in }^ears past. 

Of historical interest, the division has also received from this same 
gentleman one of the first known crystals of American spodumene, 
forming one of the lot exhibited by Dr. Edward Hitchcock in New 
England in the early part of the last century. 

2. An example of the recently discovered and described pink spodu- 
mene known locally as kunzite and utilized as gem material; the gift 
of Mr. F. M. Sickler. 

3. A specimen of anglesite with sulphur on galena from Monte Poni. 
The material is of interest in showing the processes of oxidation and 
reduction in the same specimen. 

4. A series of artificial stones used in the gem trade, including fine 
examples of pastes, doublets, triplets, and stones artificially colored; 
the gift of Mr. Oscar T. Johnasson. 

5. Cut turquoise from Idaho, Clay County, Alabama; the gift of 
Mr. Eugene A. Smith. 

6. A set of paste models showing the various forms in which gems 
are cut. 

7. Several important additions have been made to the meteorite 
collection, including examples of the Trenzano fall, weighing L63 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 99 

grams; the Franceville, Missouri, iron, weighing 300 grams; the 
Mukerop, South Africa, iron, weighing 14,288 grams; and the Finn- 
marken pallasite, weighing 595 grams. 

In addition is to be mentioned a large series of showy quartzes and 
calcites obtained by gift, collection, and purchase for the Louisiana 
Purchase Exposition. This includes some magnificent smoky quartzes 
from Montana, the gift of Mr. A. P. Pohndorf and Mr. J. R. Whar- 
ton, beautiful agates, opals, and other materials which can not be 
described in detail until they are returned from the Exposition. 

INVERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY. 

The permanent accessions in this division amount to something like 
68,000 specimens, though, naturally, this includes much duplicate 
material. 

1. The largest single accession includes some 40,000 reserve speci- 
mens transferred from the U. S. Geological Survey. These are for 
the most part determined, labeled, and arranged in zoological and 
stratigraphical order, and comprise the material which Dr. William 
H. Dall and his assistants have spent years in gathering and working 
up to its present high scientific value. 

2. The Survey has also turned over to this Museum another very 
valuable, though in large part unworked, collection. This comprises 
a series of some 1,932 Tertiary insects, brought together by Dr. Sam- 
uel H. Scudder, besides many hundred original drawings, a great part 
of which are unpublished. Mr. Charles Schuchert reports that this 
transfer makes the Museum collection of fossil insects the largest in 
America, if not in the world. 

3. Second only to the accessions mentioned above is the final por- 
tion of the E. O. Ulrich collection. This embraces the mollusca and 
miscellaneous materials of this most valuable collection, and comprises 
no less than 15,000 reserve specimens and 500 lots of original types or 
illustrated specimens. 

4. From the Imperial Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, Russia, 
through Dr. Frederich von Schmidt, was received as a gift an excel- 
lent suite of Lower Silurian Estland fossils. The material was selected 
by Mr. Schuchert while in Russia for the purpose of making correla- 
tions between the Russian and American faunas. 

5. From the Zoological Museum of the University of Copenhagen, 
Denmark, through Prof. G. M. R. Levinson, there was received in 
the way of exchange a fine series comprising more than 100 specimens 
of identified European Mesozoic and Tertiary bryozoa. 

6. From the Yale University Museum, through Dr. C. E. Beecher, 
was received as a gift a collection of 18 species, comprising 580 speci- 
mens, of Hamilton brachiopods, representing the various stages of 



100 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM;, 1004. 

growth. This is a collection of more than ordinary value, because 
of the great care exercised by Doctor Beecher in the selection and 
mounting of the material. 

.7. From Mr. B. E. Walker, Toronto, Canada, as a gift, there was 
received a number of excellent cystids from the Silurian of Grimsby, 
Ontario. 

8. For exhibition at St. Louis there were obtained, largely by pur- 
chase, an excellent series of Lower Devonian starfishes and crinoids, a 
large slab with many fine examples of JPentacrimts jwsilis, a similar 
slab of Trigonia clavata, several large ammonites, and an excellent 
series of Solenhofen invertebrate fossils. 

VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY. 

1. The most important accession of the year was a specimen of the 
pterodactyl, Rhamphorhynehus pkyllurus, showing the impression of 
the wing and tail membranes. This, as well as tine specimens of 
ichthyosaur and teleosaur {Stenosaurus) and a number of fishes typical 
of the fauna of the lithographic limestone, was purchased for the 
Louisiana Purchase Exposition. 

2. A cranium of Bison alien I, presented b}^ Mr. D. McLean, of 
Rampart city, Alaska, is important from the fact that it is the first 
specimen of this species obtained in Alaska, and because the horn 
material itself was preserved. 

PALEOBOTANY. 

The only accessions of great importance in this department were: 

1. One hundred and ninety specimens from Mazon Creek, Illinois; 
Athens, Ohio; and other localities, which form a part of the Carl 
Rominger collection purchased a year ago. This collection is especially 
valuable as containing a fair representation of silicified trunks, par- 
ticularly of the genera Ihidoxylon and Psaronins, These were accom- 
panied by a series of well-prepared microscopic sections. 

2. One hundred and thirty-two specimens from the higher beds of 
the anthracite series, collected and presented to the Museum by Mr. 
C. W. Unger, of- Pottsville, Pennsylvania. 

ROUTINE. 

In the division of geology some 1,250 labels for the exhibition 
series have been printed and distributed; at least a thousand duplicates 
have been sorted out from the material that has been gradually accu- 
mulating for years past, labeled, wrapped, and sent to storage to 
be utilized for exchanges and future distribution; 8,632 catalogue, 
bibliographic, and title cards have been prepared; 1,041 slips written 
for the type catalogue; 1,530 catalogue entries made; copy for t>L i 2 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 101 

labels prepared for the printer; 1V*3 temporary labels prepared for the 
exhibition series; 2,140 slips for the reserve collections; 895 pages of 
manuscript of scientific material prepared; and 3,658 specimens have 
been permanently numbered in oil colors. 

The entire lithological study series has been overhauled and a com- 
plete card catalogue made of the same. 

The geological section across North America, referred to in my 
previous reports, has been completed and placed on exhibition against 
the south wall of the west-south range. This, it will be remembered, 
comprises a section on a scale of 2 miles to the inch, extending from 
the coast of North Carolina to that of California near San Francisco. 

Upward of 300 thin sections of rocks have been prepared. 

In the division of minerals the entire descriptive exhibition series 
has been overhauled and labeled. The work on a card catalogue of 
the mineralogical collection is progressing favorably, some 1,300 cards 
having been thus far prepared. 

In the division of stratigraphic paleontology Mr. Schuchert reports 
that Mr. R. S. Bassler has spent a large portion of the fiscal year in 
the work of unpacking, labeling, and sorting specimens, and remount- 
ing the thin sections of bryozoa in the E. O. Ulrich collection. To 
this collection have now been added nearly all the other Museum 
bryozoa, the greater part of which are in an un worked condition. 

During the year there have been put away in final Museum condi- 
tion probably not less than a hundred thousand specimens. The exact 
number can not be given, since the Paleozoic collections have been 
growing at a remarkable rate. This growth is due largely to the pur- 
chase during the past three }ears of the Ulrich, Rominger, and Sher- 
wood collections, besides much other material, not including such as 
comes to the Museum regularly from the U. S. Geological Survey 
and through the efforts of the departmental staff. The registering of 
these specimens, as well as the work of painting the numbers and 
making the cards, is now far behind, owing to the lack of sufficient 
assistance. 

The work of preparing for distribution 500 school collections of 
invertebrate fossils, each comprising 30 to 00 specimens, is well in 
hand and will be completed during the first month of the coming 
year. The 500 collections will contain altogether not less than 60,000 
specimens. 

In the division of vertebrate paleontology a skull of a Diplodocus 
from the Marsh collections has been cleaned and mounted, and one of 
a Trachodon from Butler County, Montana, restored and remounted 
for exhibition purposes. 

Two skulls of Ceratojma, one the type of Triceratops calicomis and 
the other a fine specimen of a new genus of these great Dinosaurs, 
have been prepared for exhibition. 



102 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Iii the division of paleobotany the work of preparing the card cata- 
logue of the Lacoe collection of fossil plants is progressing slowly. 

The regular work of the Museum has been greatly interrupted dur- 
ing this period by preparation for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. 
The Curator of the Department was absent from Washington in con- 
nection with this work some ninety-one days of the year. During this 
time he made — 

(1) A trip to the Pacific coast and back, going via Ishpeming, Michi- 
gan, and the Northern Pacific to Portland, Oregon, and returning by 
way of San Francisco; Ogden, and Salt Lake, Utah; Pocatello, Idaho; 
through Wyoming to Laramie, Denver, and the Black Hills of Dakota. 
(2) A trip into western Mexico in the vicinity of Bacubirito, State of 
Sinaloa, and (3) finally, a trip into the apatite, mica, and asbestos 
regions of Canada. 

The purpose of the Mexican trip was to secure for the Louisiana 
Purchase Exposition a cast of the celebrated Bacubirito meteorite, the 
second largest known mass of meteoric iron in the world. 

Mr. Wirt Tassin, of the division of mineralogy, made a trip into an 
interesting zeolite locality near Newark, New Jersey, and obtained 
much valuable material. 

Mr. William C. Phalen made two trips into Virginia for the purpose 
of making collections and studying the unakite near Milams Gap, 
Virginia. 

Mr. Schuchert was granted four months' leave of absence in Europe, 
where considerable time was devoted to collecting Ordovician, Silurian, 
Devonian, and Carboniferous fossils. 

Messrs. W. H. Newhall, Charles Schuchert, Wirt Tassin, and the 
Head Curator were in St. Louis for periods varying from one to three 
weeks, engaged in the work of installing the exhibits of the Depart- 
ment. Dr. A. C. Peale was also on leave for a period of more than 
two months. 

ASSISTANCE TO INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS. 

There have been sent out by the Department during the period cov- 
ered by this report, in the way of gifts and exchanges, some 04 lots, 
comprising 7,138 specimens. 

In addition, material for study has been loaned to the individuals 
and institutions mentioned below: 

Mr. John M. Clarke, of the New York State Museum; Prof. W. B. 
Clark, of Johns Hopkins University; Mr. S. F. Emmons, of the U. S. 
Geological Survey; Dr. A. Handlirsch, of the K. K. Naturhistorische 
Ilofmuseum, Vienna; Prof. C. H. Hitchcock, of Dartmouth College, 
Hanover, New Hampshire; Prof. Edwin G. Kirk, of Columbia Uni- 
versity, New York City; Dr. George F. Kunz, New York Cit}^; the 
American Museum of Natural History; Mr. P. E. Raymond, New 



REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 103 

Haven, Connecticut; and Mr. Frank Springer, of the Bureau of 
Standards. Washington City. 

Portions of the collections of the Division of Geology have been 
studied by Dr. Thomas L. Watson, of Denison University, Granville, 
Ohio, in connection with the preparation of a report on the building 
stone of North Carolina. 

Prof. H. F. Osborn has continued his work on the Titanotherium of 
the Marsh collection. Dr. J. B. Hatcher spent several weeks in the 
study of the Triceratops, and Mr. F. A. Lucas in the study of the 
Stegosanr remains. 

In addition to the members of the U. S. Geological Survey, the fol- 
lowing persons have studied the collections in Paleobotany: 

Dr. Arthur Hollick, assistant curator of botany in the New York 
Botanical Gardens; the Rev. H. Herzer, of Marietta, Ohio; and Mr. 
E. W. Berry, of Passaic, New Jersey. 

PRESENT CONDITION OF THE COLLECTIONS. 

The condition of the collections as a whole is quite satisfactory, 
when everything is taken into consideration. In spite of numerous 
interruptions, due to the work of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, 
the general work of cataloguing and numbering has been carried on, 
and the records are being daily improved. 

The exhibition series is kept constantly alive through the insertion 
of new material and the weeding out of that which is old and less 
desirable. 

The section of vertebrate paleontology at present needs the largest 
share of attention. This is in part due to the fact that the work of 
preparation of vertebrate material is slow, laborious, and necessarily 
expensive. The Claosaurus mount, which was reported as nearly 
complete at the close of the last fiscal year, is now installed against 
the south wall of the southeast court. 

The exhibition series has been increased by the addition of a fine 
skull of a new genus of Ceratopsia and skulls of a Diplodocus and 
Trachodon, the latter from Butler County, Montana; also a mounted 
skeleton of Syornis casuarinus from New Zealand. 

It was hoped that we might be able to report fair progress in the 
way of mounting a Triceratops, but numerous events, including the 
resignation of a preparator, have conspired to prevent this. 

The collection of bryozoa, which has been already referred to, is 
reported by Mr. Schuchert as occupying nearly 150 standard drawers 
and comprising what is probably the most important collection of its 
kind extant. This is indicated by the number of types and illustrated 
specimens, of which there are some 620 different lots or species. 

The exhibition collections in all the divisions, with the exception of 
that of vertebrate paleontology, are as full as available space will 
permit. 



104 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

The study collections are, as a rule, in a fairly satisfactory condi- 
tion, although much remains to be done to bring the records up to 
date. 

In the division of stratigraphic paleontology much yet must be 
done to complete the records relating to the Ulrich, Rominger, and 
Sherwood collections. It is estimated that at the present rate of 
progress at least two years will be required to complete this work. 

RESEARCH. 

The routine work of the Museum, taken in connection with that of 
preparing for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, has greatly inter- 
fered with research work on the part of the Museum force. The 
Head Curator published but little. He has, however, supervised the 
work of an economic survey in North Carolina, having particular ref- 
erence to the building and ornamental stones of the States, and has 
acted in the capacity of expert special agent in charge of Report on 
Stone Quarries in connection with the census. He has prepared 
reports in both instances, but they have not yet been published. 

Mr. William C. Phalen has studied and described the rocks of the 
Nugsuaks Peninsula, in Greenland, and an occurrence of unakite near 
Milams Gap, Virginia. 

Mr. Wirt Tassin reports some eighteen analyses made looking 
toward the identification of little-known material; he has also studied 
and described a meteorite from Persimmon Creek in North Carolina. 

Mr. R. S. Bassler has continued his studies on the Rochester shale 
bryozoa. a work which he hopes to complete during the coming year. 

Mr. E. O. Ulrich, in conjunction with Mr. Bassler, has completed 
two papers on Paleozoic bryozoa. 

Miss Elvira Wood, of the U. S. Geological Survey, has prepared a 
paper treating of all the Middle Devonian crinoids in the Museum 
collections. 

CHANGES IN PERSONNEL. 

The Department of Geology has suffered severely through resigna- 
tions, due in nearly every instance to insufficient salaries. 

Mr. Alban Stewart, preparator in the section of vertebrate paleon- 
tology, resigned on March 12, last. His place has been filled, tempo- 
rarily, by Mr. C. W. Gilmore. • 

Messrs. R. S. Bassler and William C. Phalen resigned on May !> and 
15, respectively, to accept positions with the U. S. Geological Survey. 

Mr. Charles Schuchert has accepted the position of professor of 
paleontology in Yale University, though his resignation has not yet 
taken effect. 

Mr. F. A. Lucas, of the Department of Biology, who has been in 
charge of the collections of vertebrate fossils, has also severed his con- 
nection with the Museum.

Classification of the Chalcid flies,, 

or the superfamily Chalcidoidea, with 
descriptions of new species in the Car- 
negie Museum, collected in South 
America by Herbert H. Smith. 

Memoir* Carnegie Museum, i, 1903-4, No. 4, 
pp. 221-551. 

This forms a large quarto volume of 326 
pages, with 9 plates, containing 51 figures. 
It is devoted to the classification of the Chal- 
cid flics, or the superfamily Chalcidoidea, and 
to describing the new genera and species in 
the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburg, Pa. It is 
based principally upon the extensive collec- 
tion of these insects made by Mr. Herbert H. 
Smith in South America, although others in 
the U. S. National Museum are also included. 
The work is divided into two parts; the first 
part is devoted to the classification of the 
Chalcid flies of the world; the second part 
deals with the South American Chalcidoidea, 
and contains, besides the descriptions of the 
new genera and species, a full bibliographical 
catalogue of all the known species. Dr. Ash- 
mead has been studying these insects for over 
25 years and he now recognizes and defines 
14 families, namely, Agaonidae, Torymidse, 
Chalcididse, Eurytomidce, PerilampidSe, Eu- 
charidse,Miscogasterid8e,Cleonymidse, Encyr- 
tidse, Pteromalidae, Elasmida, Eulophidse, 
Trichogrammida?, and Mymaridae. Each of 
these families is taken up in order, fully de- 
fined and discussed and separated into sub- 
families, tribes, and genera. Eull tables for 
the recognition of the families, subfamilies, 
tribes, and genera are given, and with the 
aid of these tables the student should have 
no difficulty in classifying his material in 
this great complex. In all 621 genera are 
recognized as valid and tabulated. In the 
second part over 30 { J new species are described 
from South America. A full bibliography of 
the genera terminates part first, in which the 
type of each genus is specified. The last ten 
pages (pp. 522-532) are devoted to the litera- 
ture on the subject, arranged in alphabetical 
order. This is the first complete work ever 
published on these minute and obseure 
Hymenoptera, and it is hoped that Dr. Ash- 
mead's work will stimulate and facilitate their 
study. 

Three new Ichneumon flies from 



Russia. 

Can. Ent., xxxvi, 1904. 
Describes Pristomerus schreincri, Temelucha

that the name Miodon Carpenter, preoccupied 
by Dumeril for a fish, has been replaced by 
Miodontisciis Dall; and for Acus, a subgenus 
of Terebra, also preoccupied, the name Oxy-

Proc U. S. Nat. Mus., xxvi, No. 1349, July

The name Macrodon can not be used for the 
Trahirasol the South American rivers, as has 
been done since 1812, inasmuch as it had been 
taken in 1822 by H. R. Schinz for the genus 
called Ancijlodon by Cuvier. Macrodon Schinz 
must be adopted in place of Ancijlodon Cuvier 
(not Illiger 1811), and a new name (Hoplia* i) 
is proposed as a substitute for the fish genus 
of Miiller.

•GILL, Theodore. On the relations of 
the fishes of the family Lamprididse or 
Opaha. 

Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xxvi, No. 1340, July 
7, 1903, pp. 915-924, figs. 1-3. 
The genus Lampris had been associated 
■with various fishes, mostly Seonibroidean, 
but in 1903 Boulenger, having homologized 
some of the bones of the shoulder girdle in a 
peculiar way, considered it as the representa- 
tive of an independent group (Selenichthyes) 
of a new suborder (Catosteomi) which fur- 
ther included the Hemibranchii and Lopho- 
branchii. The reasons given for this classifi- 
cation are traversed, the bongs called coracoid 
and infraclavicle being homologized with 
the fourth actinost and hypocoracoid, and 
the existence of an independent infraclavicle 
is denied. There is consequently no reason 
for the association of Lampris with the Hemi- 
branchii and Lophobranchii. The affinities 
are rather with the Scombroideans, as for- 
merly claimed, but the family is isolated as 
the representative of an independent super- 
family — Lampridoidea. A diagnosis of the 
superfamily and synonyms of the family 
name are added. 

On some neglected genera of fishes. 

Proc. U. S. Nat. Mas., xxvi, No. 1344, July 
11, 1903, pp. 959-962. 
An analysis of an article published in 1790 
by H. F. Linck (Versuch einer Eintheilung 
der Fische nach den Zahnen) is given, and it 
is shown that " of the nine newgeneric names 
proposed by Linck, three are well entitled to 
adoption from him — Mustelus, Pristis, and 
Mola. The others do not seem to be pre- 
sented in suchf orm as to demand recognition . ' ' 

On some fish genera of the first 

edition of Cuvier's Regne Animal and 
Oken's Names. 

Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xxvi, No. 1346, July 
11, 1903, pp. 965-967. 
It is remarked that " in the first edition of 
the Regne Animal (1817) Cuvier introduced 
many new genera or subgenera, but most of 
them were named only in French guise. 
Consequently many naturalists have refused 
to accept them." In an entirely overlooked 
summary, also published in 1817, L. Oken 
gave Latin or Latinized names and many (18) 
date from his commentary.

The fishes of the African family 

Kneriidse. 

Science (new series), xvm, No. 154, Sept. 
11, 1903, pp. 338, 339. 
Attention is called to the agreement in 
many respects between the descriptions of 
two African genera — Kncria, described by 
Steindachner in 1866, and Cromeria, described 
by Boulenger in 1901. The discrepancies, 
which are marked, it is suggested, may per- 
haps be due to age, and possibly Cromeria 
(known only from specimens about thirty 
millimeters long) may be the youngof Kin Ha. 
The affinity of the family is doubtful, and it 
appears to be entitled to distinction as a pe- 
culiar superfamily, Kneriordea. It may be 
referred to the group Haplomi or perhaps the 
Iniomi.

An answer to Doctor Murray's defense of 
the dictionary (o. c, 209, 210) and claim that it 
"doesindeed give the earliest quotation (known 
to us at the time) for every word and sense," 
etc., and that when the writer "can cite an 
earlier instance of the word ornithology than 
can be given in the ' dictionary,' it will be time 
to write about it." 

Improper usage of the word Oology is shown, 
and earlier instances of the use of the words 
Ophidia (1802), Ophidian, a. (1813), Ophidian, n. 
(1813), and Ophiology (1817) are adduced. A~

A summary is given of (1) the bibliograph-

The Encyclopaedia Americana on 



Ichthyology. 

Science (new series), xix, No. 486, Apr. 
22, 1904, pp. 675, 676. 
Attention is called to the careless editorial 
handling of an article on "Ichthyology" by 
Dr. D. S. Jordan, and the misnaming of many 
(twelve) figures. The act is declared to be a 
wrong to the public as well as author of the 
article; the latter should be relieved of re- 
sponsibility for the errors noted.

A notice of a number of errors in a little 
book entitled " The Tree Dwellers,'' in which 
the assumption is made that the ancestors of 
the horses had live toes and lived partly in 
trees. The error of such an assumption is 
pointed out and protest is made against the 
use of the word horse for the ancient forms, 
which really belonged to a different family 
from the recent horses. It should certainly

not be used for the eocene many toed form 
named Hyracotherium, which is differentiated 
" as the representative of a peculiar family — 
the Hyracotheriids." Objection is also made 
•' to the assumption that the early represent- 
atives of the equine phylum were striped like 
a zebra. * * * The evidence, such as it is, 
is against the assumption.'' 

Non-education of the young by 

parents. 

scii nee (new series), xix, No. 492, June 3, 
1904, pp. 861,862. 
In connection with pending discussions, 
attention is called to the ••annual fishes'' of 
the family of Gobies known as Aphya pellu- 
cida and Crystallogabius » ilsson ii. The parents 
die when the breeding season is over, and con- 
sequently the young have no care takers or 
exemplars. An analogous instance is fur- 
nished by the salmons of the genus Oncorhyn- 
chus, the parents dying soon after their pro- 
creative duties have been discharged. As all 
the parents die. " the young can not have the 
benefit of parental instruction or of learning 
through association with their elders." 

The name mammal and the idea

are embodied in the present article, but much 
additional matter and literary illustrations 
are intercalated and added.

Calls attention to the American so-called 
Fusvlina, that they have not the interior 
structure of the Russian genus, and therefore 
proposes Triticites for the American form 
passing as Ftisidina cylindrica. This should be 
called Triticites secalicus Say. 

New molluscan genera from the 



Carboniferous. 

Proc. V. S. Nat. Mus., xxvn, No. 1372, 
June 1, 1904, pp. 721-736, pis. 45-47. 

This paper defines the new genera Limipee- 
trn, Plriinipkorella, and Clavulites. Also the 
new species L. texanvs, L. ti.nanis ffrandicos- 
tahts, J', papillosa, and C. howardensis. The 
genus Orthotetes Fischer de Waldhcim proves 
to be the same structurally as Waagen's later 
proposed Derbya, and the latter is, therefore, 
a synonym. For Waagen's redefinition and 
misinterpretation of Ortliotlittcs, the present 
author proposes the new name Schuchertella, 
using as his genotype Streptorhynchus lens 
White.

MASON, Otis Tufton — Continued. 

The design of this work is to study out the 
processes of weaving and other forms of tex- 
tile work done by hand in America by the 
aboriginal tribes. These processes antedate 
machinery, and some of the primitive devices 
connected with the Indian handwork led up 
to the first looms. The materials for basket 
work are enumerated, the processes of manu- 
facture described and illustrated, and the sub- 
ject of ornamentation, in form and design, 
discussed. Symbolism is shown to have fol- 
lowed the other arts in motives, but to have 
taken on special details by reason of technic. 
The many uses of basketry occupy a large 
part of the work, which closes with a discus- 
sion of the subject in its ethnic relationship.

APPENDIX IV. 



REPORT OF CHARLES SCHUCHERT, DELEGATE OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITU- 
TION AND U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM TO THE NINTH INTERNATIONAL GEO- 
LOGICAL CONGRESS, HELD AT VIENNA, AUSTRIA, AUGUST 20-27, 1903. 

The congress held its first meeting on August 20 in the festsalle of the Vienna 
University, and all the subsequent meetings were held in this large and handsome 
building. The opening gathering was a festal one, and the addresses of welcome 
were made by the protector of the congress, Erzherzog Rainer, and by the honorary 
president, Dr. von Hartel. Prorektor Hofrat Dr. Schipper greeted the congress for 
the university, and Vizeburgemeister Strobach for the city of Vienna. The president 
of the congress, director of the Royal Geological Institute of Austria, called atten- 
tion to the great variety of geological structures and formations within the Austrian 
Empire, invited all to join the excursions, and thus to learn by practical means 
what the Austrian geologists had to offer. The routine work of the congress largely 
devolved upon the general secretary, Prof. Dr. Diener, of the university. 

The social side of the congress, of course, could not be other than kindly, due to 
the well-known hospitality of Austrians, and especially of the citizens of the beautiful 
city of Vienna. On the evening of the 24th of August the congress was invited to a 
reception and banquet in the grand rathause by Herr Strobach, assisted by Dr. 
Neumayer. About 500 ladies and gentlemen participated. 

The congress was a success, as 355 members were in attendance out of 640 that had 
registered. North America was represented by 1 from Mexico, 2 from Canada, and 
22 from the United States. The standard of the papers presented was high. One 
day was occupied by seven speakers from various parts of the world in presenting 
a synopsis of our present knowledge of the crystalline rocks. Our countryman, C. R. 
Van Hise, took a leading part in this presentation. Another day was devoted to 
"Faults and Cliffs," one of the speakers being Mr. Bailey Willis, of the U. S. Geo- 
logical Survey, who presented a paper entitled "On the overthrust faults of North 
America." A timely and well-illustrated presentation was that of Dr. E. O. Hovey 
on "The 1902 eruptions of La Pelee, Martinique, and La Souffriere, St. Vincent." 
Another day was devoted to a presentation of the geology of the Balkan Peninsula 
and the Orient. The scientific meetings were on alternate days, the intermediate 
ones being occupied by excursions to noted places of geologic interest around Vienna. 
These one-day excursions were necessarily made hurriedly and were intended to 
acquaint the visitors with some of the broader structures, of which Austria has so 
large a variety. 

At Vienna a paleontologist finds much to interest him, not only in the beautiful 
and well-ordered museum and through coming in contact with many able scientific 
men, but also from a study of the great collections. If one wishes to examine 
Austrian fossils from the provincial or stratigraphic side, he will find the Geologische 
Reichsanstalt in Rasumoffskygasse full of interest. For general paleontology there 
are the splendid collections of the Naturhistorische Hofmuseum, and of paleobiology 
at the Paleontological Institute of the University.

186 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

The closing banquet of the congress, at the Hotel Continental on the evening of 
August 27, was one of those pleasant affairs which will live long in the memory of 
the attending geologists because of the general good fellowship. Tietze presided at 
this banquet and spoke the official farewell in French, followed by Geikie with rem- 
iniscences in English. The latter told us that more than forty years ago he made 
his first visit to Vienna for the purpose of consulting with Haidinger, one of the 
great geologists of that day. Of those he then met, nearly all are now gone except 
ing Suess, then a young man beginning, to attract attention, but now known to us all 
through his masterly work, " Das Antlitz der Eide." 

This reference to forty years ago, when both Geikie and Suess were young, visibly 
affected the latter. Toward the end of the speaking Suess rose, and with bowed 
head and a low voice increasing to considerable volume as he proceeded, spoke elo- 
quently in German in the following words: 

"My distinguished master, Sir Archibald Geikie, was so kind as to say that more 
than forty years ago he became personally acquainted with me. With my highly 
honored friend Baron Richthofen, it is rather near fifty years. What a memorable 
half century we have lived through! During this time, under the influence of 
increasing knowledge of nature, all human conceptions of the earth have changed. 
It is remarkable, however, to see how often the single inquirer, bent upon the object 
of his quest, fails to comprehend the broader aspects of a problem by whose details 
lie is fettered, just as the stonecutter clinging to the facade, can not see the splendor 
of the structure on which he himself is engaged. And yet there is a special charm 
in geological studies precisely on account of the extraordinary range of accommoda- 
tion that is demanded of the eye — of the same eye which now examines the disinte- 
gration of quartz in a thin slide under the microscope, now sweeps over snowy 
mountain peaks, over dark precipitous cliffs and verdant vales, and with command- 
ing glance reads their structure in the features of the landscape. But not less is the 
demand on the adjusting powers of the mind. From the most subtle conclusions 
derived from an ingenious experiment the geologist must be able to lift the mental 
eye over hill and valley into the most distant parts of the universe. There the 
glowing spectra of nebula- teach him that even now the great processes of world-making 
are not yet ended. With the aid of instruments he can daily witness the greatest 
eruptions of superheated gases emanating from the body of our sun. Photography 
spreads before him the pictures of the desolate crater fields of the moon. 

"Returning to his earth lie now perceives that the sum total of life's phenomena 
not only forms a single phenomenon, but that it is also limited by space and time. 
It occurs to him now that the stone which his hammer strikes is but the nearest 
lying piece of the planet, that the history of this stone is a fragment of the history 
of the planet, and that the history of the planet itself is only a very small part of the 
history of the great, wonderful, and ever-changing kosmos. 

" His heart then thrills; he'feels called as a colaborer on the most sublime prob- 
lems in which feeble mortal beings can take part. Then, too, he sees that the 
fundamental lines of structure coursing over the earth's surface have nothing to do 
with the political lines separating the nations. The vastness of the problem itself 
makes the concord of civilized nations natural, and they remain separated only 
through their emulation, all filled with the idea that mankind in general will most 
highly esteem that nation which is in the position to offer the most and the best of 
noble example, of new truth, and of ideal worth. 

"These are the words which have crowded into articulation at this moment when 
you, now gathered from all parts of the world, are about to disperse. 

" For the continuation of the feelings that till us to-day, and for continued inspira- 
tion for our noble science, I raise my glass." 

W \shington, D. C, June 25, 1904.

PREFATORY NOTE. 



The work herewith presented Is in part an outgrowth of a series of 
lectures to students in geology in Columbian (now George Washing- 
ton) University, though many of the facts were gathered while look- 
ing up the records of the early Government surveys, with a view of 
ascertaining the final disposition of their collections. No idea was at 
first entertained of putting the matter in book form, but as material 
gradually accumulated the advisability of making it a permanent 
record became apparent. On the supposition that it was a desirable 
thing to do at all, it is perhaps fortunate that the idea of a fairly con 
secutive history of the rise and progress of American geology was. 
like the science itself, a matter of growth, as the magnitude of the 
task would certainly have deterred from undertaking it one whose 
main opportunity lay in the improvement of odd moments. 

As to the mode of presentation of the subject: It has been the 
writer's desire to do this in a manner such as should show not merely 
what has been done, by whom, and how it has been done, but the 
gradual growth of the science and the development of powers of 
observation and deduction as well. To do this satisfactorily, no other 
arrangement than a chronological one seemed possible, though it must 
be confessed that' a topical one would have been easier to handle and 
could, perhaps, have been made more readable. In several instances, 
indeed, the topical treatment has been adopted, as in the chapters on 
the Eozoon and the Taconic question. Should it appear that the method 
is essentially similar to that adopted by Sir Archibald Geikie in his 
Founders of Geology, the writer has only to express the regret that 
the imitation is so crude. 

Let no one for a moment feel that the writer has called attention to the 
errors and crudities of observation and deduction of the early workers in 
a spirit of levity. Far from that. These men were pioneers. They had 
received little or no preliminary training along these special lines, and 
had access to but few books. The information with which the geolo- 
gist of to-day begins his career did not then exist, and an effort has 
here been made to show by what years of toil each new fact has been 
unearthed, cleansed of the debris which obscured its outlines, and 
treasured up in such form that it is now possible for the student, in a 
few short years, to encompass the garnerings of a century.

192 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Nor must it be thought that in touching upon sundry disputes, 
quarrels, and petty jealousies it has been done with an idea of belittling 
the individual in any way. Indeed, a truly able man is not belittled 
by his weaknesses. To appreciate his strength we need to know his 
weakness. These were but men, and we, who are weakly human, like to 
recognize in them human traits — like to learn of their errors in judg- 
ment and wordy warfares. 

Regarding the portraits, it may, perhaps, be well to state that a 
special effort has been made to obtain such as represented the individ- 
ual at the period of his career under discussion. This has naturally 
been a matter of some difficulty, and in some cases an impossibility. 

A large part of those here reproduced are from the G. Brown Goode 
collection in the National Museum and the private collection of the 
writer. For assistance in securing others the writer is indebted to 
Prof. W. H. Brewer, Prof. W. B. Clarke, Dr. W. H. Dall, S. F. 
Emmons, Dr. A. C. Peale, T. C. Weston, Gen. A. W. Vogdes, and 
others. Acknowledgments for other assistance are due to many, but 
particularly to Prof. Charles Schuchert, formerly of the National 
Museum, but now of Yale University. Miss Lucy M. Graves has 
rendered valuable assistance, both in preparation of tbe manuscript 
and reading the proof.

CHAPTER 1. 

THE MACLUREAN ERA, 1785-1819. 

In order that one may fully appreciate the conditions under which 
the early workers in geology in America labored, it is necessary to 
refer somewhat briefly to foreign workers and the general condition 
of the science at the time this history opens. A detailed statement is 
presumably unnecessary, the subject having been well covered by 
Lyell." Geikie, 6 and Zittel/ 

The literature extant at that time was not large, and was, moreover, 
for the most part quite inaccessible to the average American student. 
Libraries were few, small, and far between, and the workers, as a rule, 
men of moderate means who studied geology as a recreation or when 
the cares of their professions permitted. 

Disregarding the cosmogonists — those who, to use a popular expres- 
sion, did not allow what few facts they may have possessed to seri- 
ously hamper the flights of their imaginations — mention should be 
made of the writings of the French geologist, Giittard, during the 
period 171H-1765. Gi'ittard studied the now well-known region of 
the Auvergne in central France, recognized the volcanic nature of the 
phenomena there displayed, and, though he fell into error when he 
attributed their origin to the combustion of petroleum or bitumen, 
he may, nevertheless, according to Doctor Geikie, be regarded as the 
founder of volcanic geology. Singularly enough, as it seems to-day, 
he failed to recognize the connection between volcanoes and basalt, 
and attributed the latter to crystallization from an aqueous solution. 
Giittard's papers were for many years lost sight of, but their value 
and interest have of late been made apparent by the author above 
quoted. Desmarest, who followed Gi'ittard, corrected this error in 
his memoir on basalt, which appeared in 1774. 

The geological results obtained by the Russian astronomical expe- 
dition under Pallas, in 1769, though important, could, for a long time 
at least, have had little effect on American workers, and then only 
through the writings of others. They were first published at St. 
Petersburg in German (1772-177*)) and afterwards translated into 
French. Pallas taught, among other things, that a granite core was a

constituent of all mountain ranges, and that the remains of the mam- 
moth and other large animals found in Siberia and the Arctics were 
transported thence by floods from the region of the equator. This 
last idea, it will be noted, took firm hold on at least one of our 
American authors. 

During 1779-1796 the Swiss naturalist, De Saussure, had put out 
three quarto volumes giving the results of his observations in the 
Alps, and Lehman and Fuchsel, during 1756-1770, had published 
important matter relative to the order of superposition of rocks. 
Fuchsel, unfortunately, wrote wholly in Latin, and though his obser- 
vations were important they created little impression. 

The two most prominent figures, and those whose views undoubt- 
edly prevailed over all others, were the German, Werner, and the 
Englishman, Hutton. Indeed, our history opens in the very midst of 
a controversy between these two and their followers — between those 
who believed with Werner that the various rocks of the earth's crust 
were the result of a gradual precipitation from the waters of a uni- 
versal ocean and who were not inaptly called Neptunists, and those 
who recognized the efficacy of igneous agencies and were therefore 
called Phctonists. 

It is, of course, impossible to state in the majority of cases whence 
any writer may have drawn his inferences or inspiration. We may 
know the literature of any given period, but we have no means of 
knowing whether or not it was accessible to a writer or, indeed, if he 
was aware of its existence. Discoveries in science, like inventions, 
are rarely or never the work of a single brain, but are matters of 
growth. Such result from the gradual accumulation of facts or ideas, 
often seemingly wholly disconnected, but which some master mind 
takes at the proper time and molds to his uses. ' 

What is commonly regarded as the first work on American geology 
was Johann David Schopf s Beit/page zur Miner alogisc hen Kermtniss 
von des Oestlichen Theils von Nbrd Amerika und seine Gebirge, pub- 
lished in 17s7. Schopf came to America as a surgeon 

Schijpf's Work on . . . . _ . 

American Geology, to the Hessian troops during the war of the Kevolu- 

1787 

tion, and immediately after the treaty of peace in 1 783 
made a tour throughout the Eastern States as far south as Florida. 

As a foreigner, whose results were published in Germany, Schopf s 
work lies outside the limits of the present history. It may be said, 
however, that he noted the close similarity throughout all its parts of the 
Hat lands (coastal plain) extending from the western end of Long Island 
to Florida, and that this was marked off from the hilly region to the 
northwest by a double series of waterfalls in all the rivers emptying 
into the Atlantic. Thus early was recognized the ''fall line" as a 
physiographic feature of the American continent. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY MACLUREAN ERA, 1785-1819. 209 

There are several brief papers of a mineralogical nature of an earlier 
date than SchSpf's. which may be mentioned. Thus, in the Memoirs 
of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences for 1785 are to be 
found the following titles:

Benjamin Lincoln; and Fossil Substance containing Vitriol and Sul- 
phur. An Account of large quantities of, found at Lebanon, New 
Hampshire, by Jeremy Belknap. 

Of more importance are two papers by David Jones and Caleb Alex- 
ander regarding the sifpposed volcanic nature of West River Mountain 
in Connecticut. Jones described in some detail the appearance of the 
mountain and the efforts of the natives, or peasants, 
conSectfcut 0,can ° ,n »* he called them, to discover thereon the gold which 
they imagined had been melted down to a solid body 
by the extreme heat of the eruption. The rock comprising the moun- 
tain was described as in many places much burned, softened, and 
dissolved by heat, with cinders and melted drops adhering and hanging 
down like small icicles, somewhat resembling in color the cinders of a 
furnace or black glass. While convinced that there had been volcanic 
explosions in the mountain, he regarded such as having taken place at 
least fifty years earlier, while the volcano itself, he thought, could 
not have been active perhaps "within the present nor past century." 

Alexander wrote much more confidently: 

Once in winter there was an eruption. The years when the preceding eruptions 
happened I can not inform; the last was twenty-seven years since, winch was the 
most violent eruption ever known in that place. It was toward the close of a dark 
evening when it was first perceived, being preceded by a louder noise than common; 
then directly was seen the fire, which was seen to burn for several hours. 

After describing in some detail the appearance of the rock in the 
immediate vicinity of the spot from which the fire was supposed to 
have issued, Alexander went on to say: 

I am not able to determine whether there be anything of a sulphurous nature on 
this mountain, but this I dare affirm, that there have been several eruptions, but 
whether it may with propriety be called a volcano I know not. This determination 
is submitted to the judgment of gentlemen more acquainted with the nature of vol- 
canoes than I can pretend to be. 

In view of the definite nature of these statements, it may be well to 
anticipate, and to state here that iii 1810 Col. George Gibbs visited 
the mountain, attracted by the published reports, and made known 
the results of his observations in Bruce's Mineralogical Journal. He 
found no trace whatever of any eruption nor other signs of volcanic 
activity, the " lava " reported proving to be hematite, an oxide of iron.

210 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

A paper by Robert McCauslin, read before the American Philosoph- 
ical Societ}^ of Philadelphia in 1789 and published in 1793, conveys a 
good idea of the crude condition of analytical chem-

Chemistry in 1789. ■-,.„.■■. . • i 

the difficulties under which the mineralogists labored. 
In describing a " mineral substance'' 1 found near the falls of Niagara, 
he wrote: 

In order to determine the nature of this substance, I made the following experi- 
ments: 

Exp. 1st. I put an opaque piece, weighting fourteen grains, into the vitriolic acid 
diluted with three times its quantity of water, and let it remain there twenty-four 
hours, shaking it now anil then. Not the least effervescence ensued, and on taking 
out the piece it weighed near one grain more than when it'Vas put in, although care 
was taken to absorb the moisture which was upon its surface. This experiment was 
repeated with a shining piece, and with exactly the same result. 

Exp. 2nd. When put into vinegar it did not produce the least effervescence. The 
vinegar having stood upon it for sometime, it was then poured off and spirit of 
vitriol dropped into it, yet not the least precipitation ensued. 

That I might not be led into error by the vinegar not being good of its kind, I 
repeated these experiments with chalk; and as both effervescence and precipitation 
took place it was evident there was no defect in the vinegar. 

Exp. 3rd. A small piece was exposed to the heat of a blacksmith's forge during 
fifteen hours. Upon taking it out and pouring water upon it no ebullition ensued; 
nevertheless it tasted like weak limewater; being then divided into two portions, a 
solution of mild fixed alkali was dropped into the first, and immediately a precipita- 
tion ensued. The second portion being exposed to the air in a tea cup soon, con- 
tracted a changeable film, which next morning was become very thick, resembling 
in every respect that of limewater. 

Exp. 4th. Hot water being poured on some of this substance reduced to powder 
and the whole suffered to settle, the clear liquor had not the taste of limewater as 
in the 3rd experiment; nevertheless a solution of mild fixed alkali being dropped 
into it as copious a precipitation ensued as when the earth had undergone calcina- 
tion. 

As I had neither the nitrous nor muriatic acids, nor even caustic fixed alkali, I 
had it not in my power to make any trials with them. 

From these experiments we may perhaps be authorized to draw the following 
conclusions: 

1st. That this concrete is not an alkaline earth, as it is not affected either by the 
vitriolic or the vegetable acids. 

2ndly. We may with more probability say that it is a combination of an acid with 
a calcareous earth, and that it might with propriety be ranked amongst the selenites. 
This supposition is founded on the following reasons: First, it appears from the 
fourth experiment that it is practically soluble in water, and that its earth can be 
precipitated by a mild fixed alkali; secondly, the third experiment shews evidently 
that its earth is of the calcareous kind, as appears by the styptic taste and changeable- 
colored film, agreeing exactly with common limewater. It seems probable that the 
vehemence of the fire had in part expelled the acid, leaving a portion of the mass in 
the state of quicklime. 

Of more direct geological bearing is a letter from Benjamin De Witt 
to the Philadelphia Academy, printed in the second volume (IT'.'M) 



AMEEICAN GEOLOGY MACLUREAN ERA, 1785-1819. 211 

of their Transactions. He mentioned the occurrence of iron ore, 
gypsum, calcareous petrifactions, red, slaty stones, soft clay, a white 

fossil substance, rock crystal, a curious annular stone, 
thVDrift° n i79^ ,nof an d sixty-four specimens of some varieties of stone 

found on the shore of Lake Ontario. Discussing' this 
last occurrence, he wrote: 

Now, it is almost impossible to believe that so great a variety of stones should be 
naturally formed in one place and of the same species of earth. They must, there- 
fore, have been conveyed there by some extraordinary means. I am inclined to 
believe that this may have been effected by some mighty convulsion of nature, such 
as an earthquake or eruption; and perhaps this vast lake may be considered as one 
of those great fountains of the deep which were broken up when our earth was del- 
uged with water, thereby producing that confusion and disorder in the composition 
of its surface which evidently seems to exist. 

So far as I am aware, this is the first recognition of or attempt to 
account for the glacial drift, although its glacial character was of 
course undreamed of. 

It is perhaps not strange that, with the cosmogonists not yet fully 
out of the field, the "many-sided" Franklin should have indulged in 
theories relative to the earth's histoiT, nor that such were, at the time, 
thought worthy of consideration. In 1788, in a letter 
ThelTrS i788 k,in ' s to the Abb e Soulavie, he suggested that the earth may 
not be solid to the core, but that the outer portion or 
shell is floating, as it were, on an internal fluid more dense than any 
solids of which we have knowledge. He was led to this view from 
seeing at the base of one of the Derbyshire, England, mountains, 
" oyster shells mixed in the stones,' 1 a condition of affairs indicating 
an elevation of this portion of the land above the sea level and which 
he conceived could not take place were the earth solid. He wrote: 

Thus the surface of the globe would be a shell, capable of being broken and dis- 
ordered by any violent movements of the fluid on which it rested. And as air has 
been compressed by art so as to be twice as dense as water, in which case if such 
air and water could be contained in a strong glass vessel the air would be seen to 
take the lowest place and the water to float above and upon it; and as we know not 
yet the degree of density to which air may be compressed; and M. Ainontons calcu- 
lated, that its density increasing as it approached the center in the same proportion 

as above the surface, it would be at the depth of leagues heavier than gold, 

possibly the dense fluid occupying the internal parts of the globe might be air com- 
pressed. And as the force of expansion in dense air when heated is in proportion 
to its density; this central air might afford another agent to move the surface, as well 
as be of use in keeping alive the subterraneous fires; though as you observe, the 
sudden rarefaction of water coming into contact with those fires may also be an agent 
sufficiently strong for that purpose when acting between the incumbent earth and 
the fluid on which it rests. 

If one might indulge imagination in supposing how such a globe was formed, 1 
should enceive that all the elements in separate particles being originally mixed in 
confusion and occupying a greater space, they would, as soon as the- Almighty fiat 
ordained gravity or the mutual attraction of certain parts and the mutual repulsion 



212 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

of other parts to exist, all move toward their common center; that the air being a fluid 
whose parts repel each other, though drawn to the common center by their gravity, 
would be densest toward the center and rarer as more remote; consequently all 
matters lighter than the central part of that air and immersed in it would recede 
from the center and rise till they arrived at that region of the air which was of the 
same specific gravity with themselves where they would rest; while other matter 
mixed with the lighter air would descend, and the two meeting would form the 
shell of the first earth, leaving the upper atmosphere quite clear. The original 
movement of the parts toward their common center would naturally form a whirl 
there, which would continue in the turning of the new-formed globe upon its axis, 
and the greatest diameter of the shell would be in its equator. If by any accident 
afterwards the axis should be changed, the dense internal fluid by altering its form 
must burst the shell and throw all its substance into the confusion in which we 
find it. 

Again, in a letter to Mr. Bodoin, under date of 1790, he said: 

Let me add another question or two, not relating, indeed, to magnetism, but, how- 
ever, to the theory of the earth. 

Is not the finding of great quantities of shells and bones of animals (natural to hot 
climates) in the cold ones of our present world some proof that its present poles have 
been changed? Is not the supposition that the poles have been changed the easiest 
way of accounting for the deluge by getting rid of the old difficulty how to dispose 
of its waters after it was over? Since, if the poles were again to be changed and 
placed in the present equator, the sea would fall there about 15 miles in height and 
rise as much in the present polar regions, and the effect would be proportionable if 
the new poles were placed anywhere between the present and the equator. 

Does not the apparent wrack of the surface of this globe, thrown up into long 
ridges of mountains, with strata in various proportions, make it probable that its 
internal mass is a fluid, but a fluid so dense as to float the heaviest of our substances? 
Do we know the limit of condensation air is capable of ? Supposing it to grow denser 
within the surface in the same proportion nearly as we find it does without, at what 
depth may it be equal in density with gold? 

Can we easily conceive how the strata of the earth could have been so deranged 
if it had not been a mere shell supported by a heavier fluid? Would not such a 
supposed internal fluid globe be immediately sensible of a change in the situation of 
the earth's axis, alter its form, and thereby burst the shell and throw up parts of it 
above the rest? 

As if we would alter the proportion of the fluid contained in the shell of an egg 
and place its longest diameter where its shortest now is the shell must break if the 
whole internal substance were as solid and hard as the shell. 

Might not a wave*by any means raised in this supposed internal ocean of extremely 
dense fluid, raise in some degree as it passes the present shell of incumbent earth 
and break it in some places, as in earthquakes? And may not the progress of such 
wave and the disorders it occasions among the solids of the shell account for the 
rumbling sound being first heard at a distance, augmenting as it approaches, ami 
gradually "lying away as it proceeds? A circumstance observed by the inhabitants of 
South America in their last great earthquake — that noise coming from a place some 
degrees norrh of Lima and being traced by enquiry quite down to Buenos Ayres, 

proceeding regularly from north to south at the rate of leagues per minute, as I 

was informed by a very ingenious Peruvian whom 1 met in Paris. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY MACLUREAN ERA, 1785-1819. 213 

Franklin was not the only one of our statesmen who at that time 
felt at liberty to indulge in study and speculation on scientific subjects. 
Thomas Jefferson, when he came to Philadelphia to be inaugurated 
Vice-President in 1797, brought with him a collection 
PaV^ntoiolift, 1797. °f fossil bones from the western part of Virginia, and 
the manuscript of a memoir upon them, which he read 
before the American Philosophical Society, of which he had been 
elected president the preceding year. a And again in 1801, when Con- 
gress was vainly trying to untangle the difficulties arising from the tie 
vote between Jefferson and Burr, when every politician at the Capitol 
was busy with schemes and counter-schemes, Jefferson was corre- 
sponding with Doctor Wistar in regard to some bones of the mam- 
moth which he had just procured from Shawangunk, in New York; 
and still again, in 1808, when the excitement over the embargo was 
highest, and when every day brought fresh denunciation of him and 
his policy, he was carrying on his geological studies in the White 
House itself. Under his direction upward of three hundred speci- 
mens of fossil bones had been brought from the famous Big Bone 
Lick, of Kentucky, and spread in one of the large unfinished rooms 
of the Presidential Mansion. The exploration of this lick, it should 
be noted, was made at the private expense of Jefferson, through the 
agency of Gen. William Clarke, the western explorer. 6 

The appearance of bones of animals of large size and now extinct, 
as described by Jefferson, naturally excited the attention of the 
curious, and numerous accounts of similar occurrences began to find 
their way into print. In the Transactions of the American Philo- 
sophical Society, under date of 1802, is given an abstract of a commu- 
nication by Martin Duvalde regarding the finding of bones supposed to 
be those of an elephant in the Opelousas country west of the Missis- 
sippi, i. e.. in Louisiana. 

Of greater interest, however, is a paper by the artist and naturalist, 
Rembrandt Peale, entitled Account of the Skeleton of the Mammoth, 
A Nondescript Carnivorous Animal of Immense Size Found in Amer- 
ica. This was printed in London under date of 1802, 
t P he a Mammo O t U h nt i O 802. and dedicated to Sir Joseph Banks, Bart., President 
of the Royal Society. The particular skeleton de- 
scribed was exhumed in the vicinity of Newburgh, New York, in 1801/ 
The animal was regarded by Peale as unquestionably carnivorous from 

"This paper was published in the Transactions of the Society, IV, 17W, as was 
also Doctor Wistar's more detailed description of the bones themselves.

States, by G. Brown Goode. 

'Sufficient material was found to form two skeletons, one of which was sent to 
London and the other to Philadelphia, where it was subsequently destroyed by fire.

the structure of the teeth and jaw, and he concluded his description 
with a quotation from Doctor Dunter: 

If this animal was indeed carnivorous, which I believe can not be doubted, though 
we .may as philosophers regret it, as men we cannot but thank Heaven that its 
whole generation is probably extinct." 

Turning- once more to the Transactions of the American Philosoph- 
ical Society, we find in 1799 Thomas P. Smith giving an account of 
" crystalline basalts " found in the Conewago Hills, near Elizabeth- 
town in Pennsylvania. The "crystals " were described 
the Conewago Hiiis, as generally tetrahedral and of very fine grain. The 
massive, noncolumnar form was spoken of as amor- 
phous, but it "has generally a very strong tendency to crystallize." 
Cr} r stallized granite in predominating tetrahedral forms was also de- 
scribed. In the same transactions (1807) S. Godon made certain obser- 
vations for a mineralogical map of Maryland, in which he noted the 
occurrence of gneiss and greenstone in the the vicinity of Washington, 
and the finding of "fossil bodies," shells, and fossil woods in a ravine 
near Rock Creek Church. The city itself was rightly described as 
built on alluvial land, Rock Creek forming the boundary between the 
primary and alluvial soil. 

In February of this same } T ear B. H. Latrobe read before the society 
a paper describing the geographic distribution of the sand rock quar- 
ried at Aquia Creek on the Potomac, and used in some of the public 
buildings of Washington. The marked cross-bedding, so prominent a 
feature in the stone, he ascribed to wind action. A fact of more geo- 
logical importance is, however, his recognition of the "fall line" — of 
the fact that a line drawn along the lower falls of our rivers is the 
ancient line of the seacoast from New York to the southwest, and indi- 
cates a higher ocean level of some 120 feet. Schopf, it will be remem- 

«The first mention of bones of the American mammoth upon record appears to be 
that made by Dr. Cotton Mather, of Boston, in a paper communicated to the Royal 
Society in 1714. The object of this worthy divine seems to have been to corroborate, 
by the discovery of the bones, the account given in Scripture of a race of antediluvian 
giants. He inclines to this opinion from the circumstance that bones have been dug 
up in America of an enormous size, and yet resembling in their formation those of 
the human body. These bones, he states, were found in 1705 near Albany, on the 
Hudson. Among them was a grinder weighing 4f pounds; another tooth, broad and 
flat, like an incisor; a third like the eye tooth of man when worn away by mastica- 
tion, and a bone, supposed to be that of the thigh, which was 17 feet in length. The 
ground for 75 feet around the spot where these bones were discovered he asserts t<> 
have been of a different color and substance from the surrounding, a difference which 
he attributes to the effects produced by the rotting of the flesh of the animal. Some 
of these bones were found at a distance of 50 leagues from the sea, and at a great 
depth in the earth. An account, so manifestly tinctured by credulity and evincing 
such entire ignorance of anatomy, excited but little attention in the scientific world, 
and scarce any further notice of these bones can be found for nearly thirty years,—

bered, recognized this fall line, though it does not appear that lie put 
a like interpretation upon the phenomenon. 

At this date, it is well to note, none of the sciences were taught in 

the colleges and other institutions of learning in America. Indeed, 

the general trend of public opinion was decidedly against the study of 

geology or the investigation of any question which

cies in the Mosaic account ot creation or to conclusions 
in any degree out of harmony therewith. The movement, therefore, 
by Professor Dwight in 1798 toward the establishment in Yale College 
of a department for the teaching of these subjects, was of the greatest 
importance and of far-reaching consequences. This movement cul- 
minated in 1802 with the appointment of Benjamin Siiiiman to the 
professorship of chemistry and natural science in that institution. 
Siiiiman was at that time about twenty-two years of age, onh T recently 
admitted to the bar, and was serving as a tutor in law, with not even 
the most rudimentary knowledge of the science he was to teach. He 
wrote : 

The appointment was of course the cause of wonder to all and of cavil to political 
enemies of the college. Although I persevered in my legal studies * * * I soon 
after the confidential communication of President Dwight [informing him of his 
probable appointment] obtained a few books on chemistry and kept them secluded 
in my secretary, occasionally reading in them privately. This reading did not profit 
me much. Borne general principles were intelligible, but it became at once obvious 
to me that to see and perform experiments and to become familiar with many sub- 
stances was indispensable to any progress in chemistry, and of course I must resort 
to Philadelphia, which presented more advantage to science than any other place in 
our country." 

To Philadelphia he accordingly went in the autumn of 1802, remain- 
ing for nearly five months attending the lectures on chemistry given 
by Dr. James Woodhouse in the Medical School of Philadelphia. His 
own first lecture at Yale was delivered April 1, 1804, while in his 
twenty-fifth year, in a room in Mr. Tuttle's building on Chapel street. 

Few geological papers bear Silliman's name, and he is better known 
as a teacher and public lecturer. That which, however, has tended 
more than anything else to keep him in constant remembrance is his 
American Journal of Science, founded in 1818, some eight years after 
the suspension of the American Journal of Mineralogy, to be noted 
later. The publication has continued down to the present day, and it 
is therefore one of the oldest and perhaps the most important geo- 
logical periodical extant in America. 

Siiiiman resigned his professorship in 1819 and died on December 
24, 1861, having through his own efforts as a teacher, but more par- 
ticularly through his personal influence as a writer and lecturer, prob- 
ably done more to advance the science of geology than any man of 
his day. Nevertheless, looking down the vista of a hundred years of

advancement, the spectacle of this young lawyer secluding in his desk 
sundry books which he read privately in order to fit himself for the 
position of a professorship in Yale is edifying to say the least. 

On January 1, 1800, the Connecticut Academy of Sciences had 
addressed a circular letter to every town in the State, containing sub- 
jects of inquiry arranged under thirty-two distinct heads, and request- 
ing answers. To the fifth of these inquiries Silliman

the town of JNew Haven, lnis was published in the 
Transactions of the Society in 1810, and is of interest as being the 
first attempt at a geological description of the region, as well as being 
Silliman's first attempt at a geological survey. 

With much laborious argument he showed that the town of New 
Haven is itself situated on an alluvial plain. East Rock he described 
as a whinstone, trap, or basalt, identical with that from the Salisbury 
Craig near Edinburgh, Scotland. 

The stone i.s reckoned among the argillaceous clays by some mineralogists and by 
others among the siliceous. The predominant ingredient is certainly silex or flinty 
earth, although when breathed upon it emits the smell of clay, which would induce 
one to refer it to the argillaceous family. 

He would account for its presence on the supposition that it had — 
actually been melted in the bowels of the earth and ejected among the superior 
strata by the force of subterraneous fire, but never erupted like lava, cooling under 
the pressure of the superincumbent strata and therefore compact or nonvesicular, its 
present form being due to erosion. 

Thus, at this early date and with a very limited amount of experi- 
ence, Silliman was able to discriminate between effusive and deep- 
seated rocks. The rock resting upon the sandstone to the southeast 
of East Rock he found somewhat puzzling. " We must pronounce it 
granitic, although it is not a granite, and inclined to whin, although it 
is not a whinstone, " he wrote, finally concluding that it formed a con- 
necting link between granite and whinstone. Pine Rock and West 
Rock were also identified as whin rock and basalt resting upon sand- 
stone. Quartz and' sandstone found at Westfield and at the Derby 
pike were referred to as "micacious and magnesian schistus." He 
modestly concluded his paper by adding: 

If there are errors (in the above) they are not the result of indolent and remiss 
inquiry, but of deficient information or erroneous judgment. 

In these same Transactions, under date of 1808, Silliman, in conjunc- 
tion with Professor Kingsley, gave a very full account of the meteor- 
ite that fell in Weston, Connecticut, the year previous. This was the 

first really scientific description of the phenomena 
Metew-tte O, i808. attending the faH of one of these bodies, as well as of 

its mineral nature, that had, up to that time, been 
given in America, and it attracted widespread attention. It was this 
account concerning which Jefferson is said to have remarked: "It is

stones can fall from heaven."" 

A pudgy duodecimo volume of some 500 pages, from the pen of a 

Dr. James Mease, and bearing- the date 180T, may be mentioned here, 

not so much on account of the scientific value of its contents as the 

pretentiousness of its title: A Geological Account of

of their Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral Productions, 
Antiquities, and Curiosities. The portion really geological comprises 
some 30 pages, though 25 more are given up to a catalogue of minerals. 
The geological part is acknowledgedly a compilation from the writings 
of Volnev, Mitt-hill, and others. The country is divided into (1) 
granitic region, (2) region of sandstone, (3) calcareous region, (4) 
region of sea sand, and (5) region of river alluvions, the boundaries of 
each of which are given in some detail. The truly scientific character 
of the work is shown by the following quotation taken from a descrip- 
tion of the narrows of the Connecticut River. 

No living creature was ever known to pass through this narrow except an Indian 
woman, who was in a canoe, attempting to cross the river above it, but carelessly suf- 
fered herself to fall within the power of the current. Perceiving her danger she took 
a bottle of rum she had with her and drank the whole of it; then lay down in her 
canoe to meet her destiny. She marvelously went through safely, and was taken out 
<>!' the canoe some miles below quite intoxicated. 

The year 1809 must ever be notable in the history of American geol- 
ogy, since it brought forth Maclure's Observations on the Geology of 
the United States, with a colored geological map of the region east of 
„ , the Mississippi. With the exception of Giittard's

in 1(52, it was the earliest attempt at a geological map 
of America, and has caused its author to become known as the father 
of American geology and the William Smith of America. 6 

Maclure's personal history is not without interest in itself, and is 
worthy of note here on account of his relation to American science and 
as illustrating the conditions under which a man at that date could rise 
to prominence in geological circles with little or no preliminary training.

credits the authenticity of the report, regarding it one of the millions of slanders to 
which Jefferson was subjected in those days.

which is the same as that of the lirst edition of Maclure's. 



218 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

He was horn at Ayr, Scotland, in L763, and first came to America 
at the age of nineteen, with a view to mercantile employment, subse- 
quently returning to London, where he commenced his career of com- 
mercial enterprise us a partner in the house of Miller, Hart & Co. He 
seems to have been remarkably successful, and accumulated a consider 
able fortune. In l7i>6 he again visited America and, it is stated, took 
the necessary steps for becoming an American citizen. 

He was a liberal patron of science, and for twenty-two years, begin- 
ning with December, 181 T, was president of the Philadelphia Academy 
of Natural Sciences, to which institution he subsequently donated his 
valuable private library and some $20,000 in money. 

After retiring from business, and prior to 1809, Maclure spent sev- 
eral years in England and on the continent of Europe, traversing the 
most interesting portions of the Old World from the Mediterranean 
Sea to the Baltic and from the British Isles to Bohemia. On return- 
ing to America he took up the important enterprise, noted above, of 
preparing a geological map of the United States. To accomplish this, 
in the language of his biographer: 

He went forth with his hammer in hand and his wallet on his shoulder, pursuing 
his researches in every direction, often amid pathless tracts and dreary solitudes, 
until he had crossed and recrossed the Allegheny Mountains no less than fifty times. 
He encountered all the privations of hunger, thirst, fatigue, and exposure, month 
after month and year after year, until his indomitable spirit had conquered every 
difficulty and crowned his enterprise with success. 

Like several of the scientists of his time, Maclure in 182-1 became 
interested in the communistic societ} 7 at New Harmony, Indiana, 
founded by the elder Owen. He was, however, seriously disappointed 
in the outcome and withdrew about 1827. 

It was, presumably, during his connection with this association that 
he is quoted as refusing to invest money in real estate in the city of 
Philadelphia, saying: 

Land in the cities can no longer rise in value. The communistic society must pre- 
vail, and in the course of a few years Philadelphia must be deserted; those who live 
long enough may come back here and see the foxes looking out of the windows. 

Opinions like this and those which follow are quoted here, not for 
the purpose of belittling Maclure in the least, but as showing how 
impossible it was at that time for any man to realize all that was in 
store for the United States. 

The possibilities of railroad transportation were scarcely dreamed 
of, and mountain barriers and desert plains were looked upon as natu- 
ral boundaries between various peoples. From an examination of 
maps of the United States, Maclure was inclined to divide the country 
into three distinct and separate parts, differing materially from each 
other in their relative situation and in their means of communication

with the rest of the globe. The natural line of separation between the 
two main divisions was that formed by the Allegheny Mountains, 
which, from the poorness of the soil and the difficulty of access to 
market, he regarded as probably the last portion of the continent to 
become thickly inhabited. 

To the west of this range was the Mississippi basin, which, in his 
view, was destined, on account of climate and soil, to become a coun- 
try of immense agricultural capabilities. Traversed by only one great 
liver, which is practically inaccessible to large ships of war, this sec- 
tion, inclosed b} T the Alleghenies on the east, the Rockies on the west, 
and the Lakes at the north, he felt to be guarded against invasion by the 
comparative weakness of their mountain neighbors and the impossi- 
bility of attack by sea. It would therefore be given over to a nation 
of agriculturalists, the rulers of which would by nature be deprived of 
even an excuse for keeping either a fleet or army such as had in the 
past always brought about the ruin of free and equal representative 
governments. 

He wrote: 

On this earth or in the page of history it is probable no place can be found of the 
same extent so well calculated to perpetuate a free and equal representative govern- 
ment as the basin of the Mississippi, both from its physical advantages and the 
political constitutions on which the state of society is bottomed. 

The people of the Atlantic slope, he felt, would, however, labor 
under entirely different conditions. Placed on an extensive coast, 
accessible at all points, with numerous rivers, they were liable to the 
depredations of a superior fleet and would naturally become a military 
people and involved in wars with European nations. 

Maclure's observations, as already noted, were made in almost every 
State and Territory in the Union, from the river St. Lawrence to the 
Gulf of Mexico, and the memoir which embraces the accumulated 
facts was submitted to the American Philosophical Society and printed 
in their Transactions in 1809. The map of this issue is interesting 
not alone for its geological coloring, but as showing the paucity of 
knowledge regarding the physical features of the continent. (See Plate 
1.) Thus, a continuous range of mountains was figured as extending 
from northern Maine, along its western boundary, through eastern 
Vermont, western Massachusetts, across southeast New York and New 
Jersey to Pennsylvania. More or less parallel ranges were figured as 
extending down into northern Georgia, two of which turn toward the 
west, the more northerly of these terminating on the Ohio River just 
east of the Tennessee, and the other forming the divide between the 
Tennessee and the headwaters of the Tombigbee River. This last 
feature was, however, dropped out of the second issue, published 
in 1817. 



220 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

The classification of the geological formations as adopted by Maclure 
in the later issue and as given below, was naturally largely Wernerian: 

Class I. Primitive rocks. 

(Sienna brown. ) 

(1) Granite, (2) Gneiss, (3) Mica slate, (4) Clay slate, (5) Primitive limestone, 
(6) Primitive trap, (7) Serpentine, (8) Porphyry, (9) Sienite, (10) Topaz-rock, (11) 
Quartz-rock, (12) Primitive flinty slate, (13) Primitive gypsum, (14) White stone. 

Class II. Transition rocks. 

(Carmine.) 

(1) Transition limestone, (2) Transition trap, (3) Graywacke, (4) Transition flinty 
slate, (5) Transition gypsum. 

Class III. Floetz or secondary rocks. 

(Light blue.) 

( 1 ) (dark blue) Old red sandstone, or First sandstone formation, (2) First or oldest 
Floetz-limestone, (3) First or oldest Floetz gypsum, (4) Second or variegated sand- 
stone, (5) Second Floetz gypsum, (6) Second Floetz limestone, (7) Third Floetz 
sandstone, (8) Rocksalt formation, (9) Chalk formation, (10) Floetz trap formation, 
(11) Independent coal formation, (12) Newest Floetz trap formation. 

Class IV. Alluvial rocks. 

(Yellow.) 

(1) Peat, (2) Sand and gravel, (3) Loam, (4) Bog iron ore, (5) Nagel-fluh, (6) Calc 
tuff, (7) Calc sinter. 

His alluvial class, it will be observed, occupied that portion of the 
Atlantic border beginning with Long Island and extending southward 
and westward to the western Louisiana line, comprising the beds now 
mapped by the U. S. Geological Survey as in part Cretaceous, but 
mainly Tertiary and Quaternary, and forming what is known, from 
a physiographic standpoint, as the Coastal Plain. The materials 
were described as mainly sands and cla}^s, with considerable beds of 
shell deposits, and in New Jersey a greenish-blue marl (the Cretaceous 
glauconitic marls of recent workers), used as a manure. There were 
also noted deposits of iron ore and ochre. His Primitive Class was 
essentially the area mapped as Archean on the latest IT. S. Geological 
Survey maps; the Transition, the narrow belt of sedimentaries along 
the Appalachian range including the various horizons from Algonkian 
to Carboniferous; and the Secondary class, all that area to the west 
now known to be occupied mainly by Carboniferous and Silurian rocks 
with smaller areas of Algonkian and Cambrian. The red-brown sand- 
stones (Triassic) of the Eastern States were classed as Floetz or Sec- 
ondary and called Old Red Sandstone. This sandstone he however 
separated by a deeper blue in the 1818 issue from the secondary rocks 
on the western side of the range, because of its having a slight dip 
and agreeing, in the absence of organic remains and its relative posi-

tion on the .sides of many mountain ranges, with his Transition rocks. 
To the Transition beds he evidently referred all the crystalline lime- 
stones and dolomites (marbles) of western New England and the 
Southern States, tog-ether with quartzites and gray waekes. The roof- 
ing slates, now regarded as of Cambrian and Silurian ages, he classed 
as secondary. The line between the Primitive and Transition may 
"perhaps be marked b}^ the presence or absence of organic remains. 
or of aggregates of rounded particles the result of former decomposi- 
tion, in part, by the more or less crystalline texture and its approach 
toward deposition. 1 " 

To the northwest of the Transition belt lies an immense area of sec- 
ondary rocks, comprising, as above noted, the horizontal limestones and 
slates skirting Lake Champlain about Ticonderoga and Crown Point. 
There are also "immense beds of secondary limestones, of all shades 
from a light blue to black, intercepted in some places by extensive 
tracts of sandstone and other secondary aggregates, 1 ' which "appear 
to constitute the foundation of this formation, on which reposes the 
great and valuable coal formation, 11 which "extends from the head- 
waters of the Ohio in Pennsylvania, with some interruption, all the 
way to the waters of the Tombigbee. 11 He noted that along the south- 
east boundaries of this formation, as on the fork of the Holston in 
Virginia and in Greene County and the Pigeon River region of Ten- 
nessee, gypsum, salt licks, and salt springs had been discovered. In 
his first map this is indicated by a line of green extending northeast 
and southwest entirely across the State. In the second he continues 
it northeast to New York. The continuation of these as far north as 
Lake Oneida, in New York State, led him to the conclusion, since 
abundantly verified, that "we may hope one da} r to find an abundance 
of those two most useful substances (salt and gypsum), which are 
generally found mixed or near each other in all countries that have 
hitherto been carefully examined. 11 He called attention to the pres- 
ence of iron pyrites in the coal and limestone, of iron ores consisting 
principally of brown sparry and clay iron stone, and of galena in the 
Mississippi valley. On the Great Kanawha, near the mouth of Elk 
River, he noted the presence of ""a large mass of black (I suppose 
vegetable) earth, so soft as to be penetrated by a pole 10 or 12 feet 
deep. Out of the hole so made frequently issues a stream of hydrogen 
gas, which will burn some time;' 1 and he queried "if a careful exami- 
nation of this place would not throw some light on the formation of 
coal and other combustible substances found in such abundance in this 
formation. 11 The occurrence of large detached masses of granite over 
an area from Harmony, in Indiana, to Erie, New York, and thence to 
Fort Ann, in some cases at least 200 miles from any known outcrops, 
was noted, but no suggestion made relative to their probable means of 
transportation. 



222 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1004. 

In this same year S. Godon published in the Memoirs of the Ameri- 
can Academy of Arts and Sciences a paper of twenty-seven pages on 
Mineralogical Observations made in the environs of Boston in 1807 

and 1808. 

(melon's . 

Mineraiogicai As customary at that time, rocks and minerals were 

bunched together quite indiscriminately. He divided 
his minerals into two general groups, (1) Simple minerals and (2) 
Aggregate minerals. The simple minerals were then divided into 
Acidiferous substances (under which was placed carbonate of lime!), 
Earthy substances, Combustible substances, and Metallic substances. 
The aggregate minerals were classed under Primordial soil and Alluvial 
deposits. Under the first mentioned (Primordial soil) were placed all 
the primary and consolidated sedimentary rocks of the region. The 
nomenclature adopted, though somewhat cumbersome and awkward, 
was not more so than others since devised, the name of any rock being 
formed by adding the termination oid to that of the most characteris- 
tic mineral. Thus am/phiboloid, feldsparoid, a/rgilloid were the names 
of rocks in which amphibole, feldspar, or clay formed the chief con- 
stituent. The rhyolites (quartz porphyries and felsites) of the region 
were classed as simple petrosilex and compound petrosilex and the 
Dorchester conglomerate as wacke. 

The paper offers a striking evidence of the lack of knowledge of the 
composition of rocks and of chemical methods at that date. Thus an 
attempt was made at analyzing the " argilloid' 1 by reducing 100 parts 
to a " subtile" powder and mixing it with an equal part of concentrated 
sulphuric acid. After standing fifteen days the solid portion remain- 
ing was removed from the solution (method not stated), washed, and 
weighed, whereby it w T as found that 85 per cent remained. The solu- 
tion was allowed to evaporate to dryness, and from the precipitated 
sulphate of lime thus obtained it was calculated that 5.5 parts out of 
the 15 parts soluble were of lime. Alumina and iron were determined 
by precipitation by ammonia — 6.75 parts obtained. The liquid remain- 
ing from the alumina-iron filtrate was then dried and heated till the 
ammonia was driven off, the substance left dissolved in water and 
allowed to crystallize, producing an admixture of kW well characterized 
sulphate of potash and sulphate of soda." " This analysis, 11 while con- 
fessedly not of great accuracy, he wrote, " is sufficient to establish the 
important fact of the existence of potash and soda as elements in some 
rocks in this part of the world." Truly an important discovery! 

In the same memoirs and this same year Prof. Parker Cleaveland, of 
Bowdoin College, perhaps all unintentionally, started the controversy 
relative to Glacial and post-Glacial uplift and depression by announ- 
cing the finding of fossil shells belonging to genera still living in 
deposits of sand and clay well above sea level at Brunswick, Maine.

In January, 1810, there was established by Prof. Archibald Bruce 

the American Mineralogical Journal, the first American publication 

designed primarily for geologists and mineralogists. The life of this 

journal was, however, short, the last issue bearing the 

Bruce's American . . 

Mineralogical date of 181-1, and the whole number comprising but 

Journal, 1810. _. r ° 

•J0> pages. 

The first paper was by Samuel L. Mitchill, professor of natural his- 
tory and botany in the University of the State of New York. This 
consisted of an annotated catalogue accompanying a suite of mineral 
specimens made during a tour to Niagara in 1809. 

Among the other papers which followed mention may be made of 
one by Colonel Gibbs on the Iron Ores of Franconia, New Hampshire; 
by Benjamin Silliman on the Lead Mines near Northampton, Massa- 
chusetts; by .lames Catbush on the Blue Earth of New Jersey, and by 
W. Meade on Elastic Marble, a "fossil of 
rare occurrence'" found near Pittsfield, 
Massachusetts. 

The more important strictly geological 
papers were by Dr. Samuel Akerly and 
included a geological account of Dutchess 
County in New York, one on the improba- 
bility of finding coal on Long Island or in 
the vicinity of New York, and one on the 
geology and mineralogy of the island of 
New Y'ork. Akerly described the high- 
lands of Dutchess County as consisting of 
granitic rocks, and the whole country north 
of the highlands as underlaid with primitive 
slate, most of the hills being composed of 
limestone. New York Island was described as underlaid throughout 
its northern part by primitive rocks, granite, and limestone; the south- 
ern part, upon which the then existing city was built, as composed of 
an alluvion of sand, stone, and rocks. This he regarded as a recent 
deposit "subsequent to the creation and even the deluge." The man- 
ner in which this alluvial material was deposited he described as 
follows: 

After the waters of the Deluge had retired from this continent, they left a vast 
chain of lakes, some of which are still confined within their rocky harriers; others 
have since broken their bounds and united with the ocean. The highlands of 
New York was the southern boundary of a huge collection of water, which was con- 
fined on the west by the Shawangunk and Katts-kill mountains. The hills on the 
east of the Hudson confined it there. When the hills were cleft and the mountains 
torn asunder, the water found vent and overflowed the country to the south. It 
was then that the channel of the Hudson was formed, ami its stream has never 
since ceased to flow. The earth, sand, stones, and rocks brought down by this tor- 
rent were deposited in various places, as on this island, Long Island, Staten Island, 
and the Jerseys. This opinion is mostly hypothetical, because unsupported by a

sufficient number of facts, but that it is probable maybe judged by what follows. 
(See Mitchill's views on p. 231.) 

In the same journal Samuel Brown, of Lexington, Kentucky, gave a 
description of a cave on Crooked Creek, with remarks and observa- 
tions on niter and gunpowder; Robert Gilmore, a descriptive cata- 
logue of minerals occurring in the vicinity of Baltimore; while S. L. 
Mitchill proposed an amendment to Maclure's chart of the United 
States so far as it related to the character of the north side of Long 
Island, which he showed to be alluvial and not primitive, as stated, 
and Benjamin Silliman described the plain of New Haven as wholly 
alluvial and of very recent origin. This paper is evidently a partial 
reprint of one offered before the Connecticut Academy of Sciences 
in 1810 and referred to elsewhere (p. 216). 

A paper by J. Corre de Serra, the Portuguese minister then resid- 
ing in Philadelphia, read before the American Philosophical Society 
in 1815, and published in their Transactions in 1818, is of interest as 
showing the condition of knowledge relative to so commonplace a 
phenomenon as that of rock weathering and formation of soils. His 
paper was entitled Observations and Conjectures on the Formation 
and Nature of the Soil in Kentucky. He regarded this soil as the 
product "of the decomposition of an immense deposit of vegetables 
which the ocean had left uncovered by any other deposition." 

It may be remembered that Jefferson, in his notes on the State of 

Virginia, had described in considerable detail and very eloquently the 

now well-known Natural Bridge of Rockbridge County, which he 

regarded as spanning a gigantic fissure, the result of

William Gilmer had a paper on the same subject, illustrated by a full- 
page plate. The bridge was described in detail and its formation 
ascribed, not to a sudden convulsion, as argued by Jefferson, or to 
any extraordinarily sudden deviation from the ordinary laws of nature, 
but to the "very slow operation of causes which have always and 
must ever continue to act in the same manner. 1 " This cause he rightly 
considered to be the solvent action of meteoric waters on limestone. 
In this respect Gilmer, although scarcely known to geological science, 
was vastly in advance of the workers of his day. 

Three years later the Rev. Elias Cornelius, a man of education and 
culture, but whose professional training seems to have quite unfitted 
him for the work of a geologist, also discussed the subject in a paper 

in the American Journal of Science, giving the results

words, no ""difficulty even in supposing it (i. e., the bridge) to have 
proceeded from the hand of the Almighty as it is." 

Next to Maclure's Observations on the Geology of North America, 
undoubtedly the most important of the early publications was Parker 
Cleaveland's Elementary Treatise on Mineralogy and Geology, a work 
of upward of six hundred pages, with live plates of 
Treatfse'oii 8 crystal drawings and a colored geological map. 

G^iog a y?l8i a 6 nd Fo1 * most of the geological observations and for the 

map Cleaveland was indebted to Maclure and to writ- 
ten communications from II. H. Ha} T den. The principal variation 
from Maclure's map lay in the adoption of the suggestion of S. L. 
Mitchill regarding the extension of the alluvial deposits on Long Island. 
It further differed from that published b} T Maclure in 1817 in that a 
large portion of southern and western Maine was colored as occupied 
b} T transition rocks, this area having been left blank by Maclure. 

The classification adopted in the work was largely chemical, the 
minerals being divided into (1) classes, (2) orders ? (3) genera, and (4) 
species, his definition of species being "a collection of materials 
which are composed of the same ingredients, combined in the same 
proportions." 

In the tabular view given, all known minerals were grouped under 
four classes, as follows: Class 1, substances not metallic, composed 
entirely or in part of an acid; class 2, earthy compounds or stones; 
class 3, combustibles, and class 1, ores. As was the case with all 
writers of that day, basalt and several other compact rocks of indis- 
tinct mineralogical nature were classed as minerals. Thus is found 
under class 2, species 15, porceUanite; species 16, .silicon slate; species 
32, i mi /■<//</, and species 34, basalt. This last was described as never 
ciystallized but occurring "in large amorphous masses, but also under 
a columnar, tabular, or globular form" and passing insensibly into 
"greenstone, wacke, and perhaps clinkstone." 

Not only was the mineralogical nature of basalt little understood, 
but even its relationship to volcanic rocks as well. It was described 
as sometimes found in countries decidedly volcanic, but seldom near 
the craters of still active volcanoes; " on the contrary, it appears at 
the foot of volcanic mountains and sometimes almost surrounds them." 
Some of the most noted localities mentioned are the Giant's Causeway, 
island of Staffa, the Erzgebirge, Auvergne, etc. Its occurrence in 
the United States was regarded as doubtful, though he noted its 
reported occurrence on the Stony (Rocky) Mountains. It was regarded 
as of both igneous and aqueous origin. 

Anthracite, which forms species t> under class 3, combustibles, was 
described as "strongly resembling coal, from which, however, it 
materially differs." It was said to occur in primitive or transitional 
rocks, though sometimes connected with secondary rocks. Obviously,

therefore, it is stated, it bus not, at least in many eases, resulted from 
the decomposition of vegetable matter. 

Pages 586 to 636 of Cleaveland's first edition included an introduction 
to the study of geology. Some of the statements here made are of 
interest: wu Most of those extensive masses of strata," he wrote, "with 
which geology is concerned are compound minerals, or aggregates, 
composed of two or more simple minerals mingled in various propor- 
tions and denominated rocks."" While thus a division into species and 
genera may be possible with minerals, with rocks the case is quite 
different. "It is obvious that they can not admit of distinctions 
which are strictly specific." This observation holds good to the pres- 
ent day. His remarks on the position of the beds of rocks were no 
less interesting: 

When primitive rocks are stratified the strata are seldom horizontal. On the 
contrary, they are often highly inclined and sometimes nearly or unite vertical. 
But whether these strata were originally inclined or whether, subsequent to their 
formation, they have been changed from a horizontal to an inclined position by the 
action of some powerful cause, is a question on which the most distinguished geolo- 
gists are divided in opinion. 

Again: 

It is further evident that the higher the level at which any rock appears at the 
surface of the earth, the older is the rock; for it so declines as to pass under those 
rocks which appear at a lower level. The only exception to this general fact appears 
in those horizontal strata of secondary rocks which sometimes rest on the summits 
of high mountains. 

The theory of the earth adopted by Cleaveland is apparently that of 
Cuvier. In his discussion of the origin of rocks and geological sys- 
tems he was for the most part a follower of Werner, though he recog- 
nized some of the difficulties attendant upon the complete adoption of 
the Neptunian theoiy. "Though its general outlines may be correct, 
we are yet unable to give its details. It seems, however, to be rather 
encumbered with difficulties than absolutely confronted by existing 
facts. " His views regarding volcanoes were largely a reflection of those 
advocated by his European contemporaries, and need but brief allusion. 

Many parts of the external crust of the earth are subject to the action of subter- 
ranei ms tire. In some cases these tires are comparatively mild and produce no impor- 
tant effects, excepting the destruction of the combustibles which feed them, and are 
nothing more than coal mines in a state of combustion. But in other cases these 
subterraneous tires rage with resistless impetuosity. 

Cleaveland was a graduate of Harvard in the class of 1790, and was 
in 1805 appointed to the professorship of mathematics, natural phi- 
losophy, chemistry, and mineralogy in Bowdoin College, Brunswick, 

Maine. He is described by his biographer (the elder 
cieaveiand. Sillimaii) as a man of great natural ardor and activity. 

with a reputation for zeal, industry, and learning. To 
these statements certainly no one will take exception, when the period 
and magnitude of his work and manifold character of his professional

duties are taken into consideration. It must be remembered that his 
was the first attempt made in America at a systematic treatise on min- 
eralogy.. (Shepard's came sixteen and Dana's twent} r -one years later.) 
The only available foreign works were those of Jameson, Kirwan, 
Werner, and Brongniart; moreover, there were in America few, if 
air\ r , important mineral cabinets, those of B. D. Perkins, Archibald 
Bruce, and Col. George Gibbs alone being worthy of mention. The 
work, we are told, was received with great favor, two editions being 
issued, the second in two volumes bearing date of 1822. A third was 
called for but never prepared, owing to the failing health of the author/' 

An interesting side light is thrown by one of the reviewers of the 
first edition upon the condition of the science at that time. Thus he 
wrote of Hauy's "curious discoveries regarding the six primitive fig- 
ures or solids which form the base of all crystals," and called it " the 
most singular and acute discovery of our age," though "there is a 
difference of opinion among mineralogists as to the practical use of 
crystallography in the discrimination of minerals." The same 
reviewer naively remarked: "In this age of bookmaking it is no small 
negative, praise if an author be acquitted of unnecessarily adding to 
the onerous mass of books." 6 

Not satisfied with his first edition, which, according to Marcou, was 

published during the author's absence in Europe, Maclure immediately 

set about obtaining the necessary information for a revision, and in 

1817, after eight years of hard work, presented the 

Second Edition of . 

Maciure's amended memoir, which was republished in the trans-

actions of the Philosophical Society and also in the 
form of a separate volume of 127 pages, bearing the same date. The 
second issue differed considerably from the first, the most conspicu- 
ous features being the delineation of the mountain ranges and the cor- 
rection of many minor details regarding the distribution of various 
geological formations. 

On Plate 2 of this issue he gave five sections across the United States 
from the Atlantic, through the Appalachian regions and the secondary 
rocks of the Mississippi, which were colored to correspond with the 

" In a letter dated Madrid, August 20, 1822, Maclure writes to ( 'leaveland as follows: 
"I felicitate you on a second edition of your mineralogy being so soon necessary. 
The rhineralogical professor here, Dn. Donato Garcia, has the intention of trans- 
lating your work into Spanish as the best elementary book yet known." As to 
whether or not this intention was carried out, the present writer has no information. 

b The second American work on mineralogy by one who could with propriety be 
called a mineralogist and original worker was Prof. C. r. Shepard's Treatise on 
Mineralogy, Shepard being at that time twenty-eight years of age and an assistant to 
Professor Silliman at New Haven. The work, which was founded on that of the well- 
known Austrian mineralogist, Mohs, appeared in the form of a small octavo volume 
of 256 pages. In 1835 a second part in two volumes of 630 pages appeared. Being 
purely mineralogical in its nature, but passing note can be made of it here. A second 
edition was issued in 1844.

scheme in the map. (See Plate 5.) The lirst section extended from 
Camden in Penobscot Bay, Maine, to Oxboro, near Kingston, on Lake 
Ontario; the second from Plymouth, Massachusetts, to Cayuga Lake, 
New. York; the third from Egg Harbor, New Jersey, to Pittsburg, 
Pennsylvania; the fourth from Cape Henry, Virginia, to Arlington, 
in the same State, and the fifth from Cape Fear, North Carolina, to 
Warm Springs, in the same State. The poverty of information at 
that time relative to the Rocky Mountain region is shown in the state- 
ment that "the tops of the Stony Mountains are covered to a consid- 
erable extent with perpetual snows and pendent glaciers." 

As was the case with a majority of the earlier surveys and geological 
text-books, considerable attention was given to the relation of the 
science to agriculture, and the two closing chapters of the second issue 
were given up to Hints on the Decomposition of Rock, with an 
Inquiry into the Probable Effects they may Produce on the Nature 
and Fertility of Soils. The kinds of soils resulting from the decom- 
position of various rocks were discussed with particular attention to 
their physical nature, but while occasional references were made to 
their content of lime, the alkalies, and other constituents, no chemical 
analyses were given, nor was their desirability apparently appreciated. 

It does not seem to have been realized, however, that throughout 
the entire glaciated area as now known there may be little connection 
between the soils and the rocks immediately underlying them. 

During 1818, as already noted, there was founded the American 
Journal of Science, or, as it was familiarly called, Silliman's Jour- 
nal, the first volume bearing on the title-page the date 1819. It is 
notable as being the first American journal to be given 

The American i-i ■ ii • 

journal of science, up largely to geological subjects, although other sci- 
ences were b}^ no means debarred. In fact, as noted 
in his plan of the work, the Journal was intended to embrace the circle 
of the physical sciences and their application to the arts and to every 
useful purpose. 

From its earliest inception geological notes and papers occupied a 
prominent place in its pages, and a perusal of the numbers from the 
date of issue down to the present time will, alone, afford a fair idea of 
the gradual progress of American geology- I shall note in the follow- 
ing pages many articles taken from the Journal, particularly the 
earlier numbers, as serving best to illustrate the condition of the 
science at the time of their issue. 

Among the earliest publications on the geology and mineralogy of 
New England mention must be made of J. F. and S. L. Dana's Out- 
lines of the Mineralogy and Geology of Boston and Vicinity, which 
bears the date of 1S18, and which is further noteworthy

and the various reprints of Maclure's. The classification adopted was 
that of Werner, and hence, of course, purely lithological. The various 
rocks enumerated and colored on the map were: I. The Primitive, 
including granite, argillite, primitive trap, porphyry, and syenite; II. 
Transition, including amygdaloid and graywacke; and III. Alluvial, 
including sand, pebbles, clay, and peat. No granite was, however, 
recorded as in place, the granite of Quincy and the areas west of north 
of Marblehead being colored as syenite. The argillite was regarded 
as the oldest rock occurring in the vicinity, and was represented as 
forming gently undulating eminences in Charlestown, Watertown, 
Chelsea, and Quincy. Greenstone, or primitive trap, was represented 
as occupying all of the Marble head-Salem areas and large areas to the 
west, including Stoneham and Lexington. Porphyry, "a compound 
rock having a compact basis, in which are embedded crystals or grains 
of other minerals of contemporaneous formation," and which passes 
into both syenite and petrosilex, they found 
in Maiden, Lynn, and Chelsea, while the 
large area beginning at the shore east and 
north of Lynn and extending southwest- 
ward as far as Maiden, was colored as /» tro- 
silex. A wide strip, extending from just 
west of the Charles River to the coast, in- 
cluding Brookline, Roxbury, and Dorches- 
ter, was colored as graywacke, this being, of 
course, the conglomerate of later writers. 
On the northern and western edges of this 
are narrow belts colored as amygdaloid, the 
same being the rock later shown by Benton 
to be melaphyr, or ancient basaltic lava flow. 
The minerals as described were divided 
into Class I. Earthy fossils; Class II. Saline fossils; Class III. 
Inflammable substances; and Class IV. Metallick fossils. Under 
Class I were included the phosphates and carbonates of lime, quartz, 
such silicates as mica, shorl, feldspar, garnet, epidote, the amphi- 
boles, etc., and such compound substances as petrosilex, basalt, 
wacke, schaalstone, argillaceous slate, and clay. The second class. 
Saline Fossils, included but a single species, sulphate of iron. Class 
III included hydrogen gas and peat, and Class IV sulphides and 
chlorides of copper, sulphide, oxide, and carbonate of iron, sulphide 
of lead, and oxide of manganese. The classes were subdivided into 
orders and the orders into genera, species, subspecies, and varieties. 
Thus novaculite was considered a subspecies of argillaceous slate, a 
species under Order II, Nonacidiferous substances of Class I, Earthy 
fossils. Altogether some 21 species of Earthy fossils were recog- 
nized, 1 of Saline fossils, 2 of Inflammable substances, and 8 of 
Metallick fossils. These were all described in detail, their physical

External characters. 

Its colours arc grey and purple. Of grey, it occurs blackish grey and greenish 
grey; of purple, lavender purple. The colours vary much in their intensity. 

It is dull. 

It is amorphous ami cellular. 

It exhales a strong argillaceous odour when breathed upon. 

It adheres to the tongue. 

Its streak is greyish white, with a reddish purple tinge in some parts, and is dull. 

It is moderately hard, passing to soft. 

The fracture is from fine grained uneven to earthy; some specimens show a slightly 
slaty structure. 

It is brittle. 

It is easily frangible. 

The fragments are indeterminately angular and not particularly sharp edged. 

Its specifick gravity is about 2.88.

Before the blowpipe it melts into an opaque, semi-vitreons mass which appears

Geological situation and localities. 

It occurs in beds in Petrosilex at Milton, and forms the basis of Amygdaloid at 
Brighton, Ilingham, Newton, Ac, and it is found also in rounded fragments at 
Xeeilham, Newton, Brighton, &c. 

Remarks. 

This mineral sometimes much resembles ferruginous clay, and is intermediate 
between ( 'lay and Basalt. It is very liable to decomposition, and when it forms the 
basis of Amygdaloid, by undergoing tins change, it leaves the imbedded minerals 
projecting, or they fall out and leave the Wacke cellular. " 

In 1818 there was published by Kirk and Mercein in New York 

Robert Jameson's translation of Cuvier's celebrated essay on the 

Theory of the Earth, and with it S. L. Mitchill's Observations on the 

Geology of North America. 6 It is the Observations

"This work was the subject of a scathing review in the Analectic Magazine, XIII, 
1819, where the writers were accused of having borrowed at least three-fourths of 
their material "for the mere purpose of eking out the matter to the proper size of a

scientific men of his day, hud read and traveled extensively, and it may 
he safe to assume that the views heid by him were supposed to rest 
upon a good foundation, though they were not wholly accepted, as is 
mentioned later. 

It was Mitchill's idea that the Great Lakes were the shrunken rep- 
resentatives of great internal seas of salt water, which ultimately 
broke through their barriers, the saline lakes becoming gradually 
freshened by a constant influx of fresh water. The remains of the 
barriers which held back for a time this inland sea he thought to be 
still evident. One of them, he wrote, seemed to have circumscribed 
to a certain degree the waters of the original Lake Ontario and to be 
still traceable as a mountainous ridge be- 
yond the St. Lawrence in upper Canada, 
northeast of Kingston, passing thence into 
New York, where it formed the divide 
between the present lake and the St. Law- 
rence, and, continuing to the north end of 
Lake George, apparently crossed the Hud- 
son above Hadley Falls. Thence he be- 
lieved it to run toward the eastern sources 
of the Susquehanna, along the Cookwago 
and Papachton branches of the Delaware, 
crossing the last named a little north of 
Easton (Delaware Watergap), the Lehigh 
north of Heidelburg (Lehigh Gap), and the 
Schuylkill northwest of Hamburg in Penn- 
sylvania. Continuing thence along to the north of Harrisburg. 
across the Susquehanna, in a southwesterly direction until it entered 
Maryland, and passed the Potomac at Harpers Ferry into Virginia, 
where it became confounded with the Allegheny Mountains. Thence 
gradually disappearing, traces of it appeared to the westward, as at 
Cumberland Gap in Tennessee and the mountains west of Cape 
Girardeau beyond the Mississippi. 

It is evident that for a good part of its course, as traced, this barrier 
was but the Blue Ridge, while in eastern New York it was comprised 
mainly of the Catskills and Adirondacks. 

To appreciate Mitchill's view, then, we have to imagine this now 
broken and gapped ridge as continuous throughout its whole extent, 
forming a vast dam holding back the waters of several salt inland seas 

early tendency to reprint many of the English works on geology and mineralogy. 
This finds its most important illustration, from the present standpoint, in the reprint- 
ing of Frederick Accums's A Practical Essay on the Analysis of Minerals (Philadel- 
phia, 1809); Cuvier's Essay, as noted above; BakewelPs An Introduction to Geology 
(New Haven, 1829); Cuvier's A Discourse on the Evolution of the Surface of the 
Globe (Philadelphia, 1831) ; and De la Beche's A Geological Manual (Philadelphia, 
1832), etc.

to the northward, while the region to the southward was dry land. A 
tittie came, however, when the dams at various points proved too frail 
and gave way, the pent-up waters rushing through and carrying 
devastation with them like the waters from cloud-bursts or bursting- 
reservoirs of to-day, but on a thousandfold larger scale. 

One breach was conceived to have been at the northeastern extremity 
of Lake Ontario. The Thousand Isles, to Mitchill's mind, " bear wit- 
ness to the mighty rush of waters which thus prostrated the opposing

operation the water must have subsided about 160 feet,"" or to its

and left bare * * * exposing to view the waterworn pebbles, the works of marine 
animals, their solid parts buried in the soil, their relicks bedded in the rocks, and the 
whole exhibition of organic remains formed in the bottom of such a sea as that was. 

Great masses of primitive rocks from the demolished mound or dam and vast 
quantities of sand, mud, and gravel were carried down the stream to form the 
curious mixture of primitive with alluvial materials in regions below. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY MACLHREAN ERA, 1785-1819. 233 

A second breach was conceived to have been at the northern 
extremity of Lake George, whereby the lake was diminished to about 
its present size. A third was at Hadlev Falls; a fourth at the upper 
falls of the Mohawk; a fifth was made by the pent-up waters of the 
Delaware above Easton, Pennsylvania; a sixth by the Lehigh to the 
northwest of Bethlehem; a seventh by the Schuylkill ; an eighth by the 
Susquehanna, and a ninth by the Potomac cutting its way through the 
Blue Ridge at Harpers Ferry. A second series of lakes and dams he 
conceived as having existed outside, i. e., to the southward of those 
above mentioned. To the bursting of these he attributed many of the 
minor features of the present landscape. 

The work contains little in the wa} r of systematic geology aside 
from the speculations above mentioned, though there are disconnected 
references to and descriptions of fossil remains and rocks found in 
various parts of the country. He, however, called attention to the 
possibility of the Great Lakes having formerly drained into the Mis- 
sissippi, the gradual retreat of the falls of Niagara, and the formation 
of the gorge through the undermining of the harder surface limestone, 
facts which seem to have been very early recognized. 

This same year witnessed the first appearance in geological science 

of Edward Hitchcock, then a young theological student of twent}-five, 

but who was destined to be one of the most prominent figures of his 

time. Hitchcock came first into notice in 1815 through 

Edward Hitchcock's . . , 

First Geological some astronomical observations and corrections fur- 
nished Blunt's Nautical Almanac. His inclination, 
however, early took a geological turn, and throughout a prolonged 
period of activit}% first as a clergyman and later as professor, presi- 
dent, and again professor in Amherst College, he kept himself ever 
prominently to the front. 

The first State geological surve}- carried to completion, that of 
Massachusetts, 1830-1833, was primarily his conception and executed 
almost wholly through his efforts. He became, however, most widely 
known and is best remembered through his work on the footprints 
found in the Triassic sandstones of the Connecticut Valley and his 
studies of the drift phenomena, in both of which he was a pioneer. 
Indeed, if one may be allowed to speak facetiously of so cultured and 
dignified a gentleman, he was America's first k " superficial geologist," 
and a perusal of his papers alone will give a very fair idea of the 
development of the glacial lypothesis in America. 

The paper to which allusion is made above, Some Remarks on the 
Geology and Mineralogy of a Section of Massachusetts on the Con- 
necticut River, with a Part of New Hampshire and Vermont, was 
published in the first volume, 1818, of the American Journal of 
Science. It is noteworthy on account of a geological map of the 
region, colored by hand, and a transverse section of the rock strata

from Hoosac Mountain to 11 miles cast of the Connecticut River. 
The rocks were classed as primitive, secondary, and alluvial, the older 
crystallines and the argillites being- considered as primitive, while the 
traps and sandstones were put down as secondary. 

The year 1818 was rendered notable also by the appearance in the 
geological arena of Amos Eaton, a man who, like Hitchcock, was 
destined to achieve a national reputation, but whose mental character- 
istics were as unlike Hitchcock's as was possible 
Eaton's index, 1818. among men in the same calling. His first geological 
paper occupied three pages of the American Journal 
of Science for the year under discussion. His first noteworthy publi- 
cation was the Index to the Geology of the Northern States, which 
appeared in the form of a text-book for the geological classes at Wil- 
liams College that same year. Eaton is described as a man of great 
force, untiring energy, and was one of the most interesting men of his 
day. In 1816, at the age of forty, he abandoned the practice of law and 
went to New Haven to attend Silliman's lectures on mineralogy and 
geology. Subsequently he traveled many thousand miles on foot, 
throughout New England and New York, delivering in the principal 
towns short courses of lectures on natural history. In March, 1817, 
having received an invitation to aid in the introduction of the natural 
sciences in Williams College, his alma mater, he delivered a course of 
lectures in Williamstown. Such was the zeal at this institution, he 
wrote, that "an uncontrollable enthusiasm for natural history took 
possession of every mind, and other departments of learning were for 
a time crowded out of the college." In April, 1818, on invitation of 
Governor De Witt Clinton, he delivered in Albany, before the mem- 
bers of the State legislature, a course of lectures on natural history. 
Here was undoubtedly the beginning of the work which resulted in 
the establishment of the State survey. 

In the "Index 11 mentioned above (which has been pronounced "the 
first attempt at an arrangement of the geological strata of North 
America 1 ') the views expressed were naturally largety tinged with 
Wernerism. They are reviewed in detail here, even when almost 
exact equivalents, on account of their local application. 

Eaton divided the rocks of the earth's crust into five classes: First, 
Primitive; second, Transition; third, Secondary; fourth, Superin- 
cumbent; and, fifth, Alluvial; .the bod}^ of the work, occupying pages 
15 to 41, inclusive, being given up to their description and geograph- 
ical distribution. 

Under the head of Primitive rocks he included granite, granular 
limestone and quartz, gneiss, mica-slate, soapstone rocks, calcareous 
and granular quartz, and syenite. These were regarded as barren of 
fossil remains and the oldest rocks to which human research had 
extended.

In the Secondary class he 
included the red sandstones of the Catskills (Devonian), as well as 
those of the Connecticut River (Triassic). Discussing the position 
of the Catskill stone, he wrote: "Bakewell removed this stratum

from the Secondary class (where Werner placed it) to the Transition. 
He .says this stratum terminates the series of transition rocks con- 
taining metallic veins and the more ancient organic relics. Had 
Bakewell ever visited Catskill Mountain he would undoubtedly have 
left the red sandstone where Werner placed it; for here the true old 
red sandstone of Werner contains the organized remains of at least 
one well-known phenogamous woody plant. " tt He also stated that 
this sandstone contained the petrified remains of the roots of the 
Kalinin latzfoUa, or common laurel! The gypsum and rocksalt beds 
of New York and Pennsylvania, now regarded as of Salina age, he 
included in this Secondary class, and also the common compact lime- 
stone occurring in the western part of New York State, but not found 
east of the Hudson River. 

In the Superincumbent class were included, as already stated, green- 
stone trap, amygdaloid, and basalt, which he regarded as varieties of 
one and the same rock. This assumption on his part is interesting in 
connection with the discussion of the last twenty years (since the 
introduction of the microscope into geology) regarding the now well- 
established relationship existing between basalt, melaphyr, and' dia- 
base. While these rocks were considered by him as volcanic, their 
exact source seemed problematic. " On the Deertield River the green- 
stone sinks down in a fissure in the red sandstone. * * * Bakewell 
would say here were volcanoes and here the melted greenstone was 
thrown up through the sandstone." 

In discussing his Alluvial class, he wrote: 

It is agreed by all geologists that all soils, excepting what proceeds from decom- 
posed animal and vegetable matter, are composed of the broken fragments of disin- 
tegrated rocks. From this fact it is natural to infer that the soil of any district 
might be known by the rocks out of which it is formed; consequently, that rocks 
abounding in quartz would produce a sandy soil and those abounding in argillaceous 
slate a clay soil, etc. * * * This inference is certainly correct, but there is great 
difficulty in determining what rocks may have extended over any particular district 
and been entirely dissolved in former ages. Is there not good reason to believe that 
most of the strata now constituting Cal skill Mountain * * * once extended over 
Massachusetts to the Atlantic Ocean? 

That these strata once extended as far as Massachusetts and united 
to the same strata at Pittsfield and Stockbridge he regarded as beyond 
question, and he concluded that a mass of rock from 1,000 to 3,000 
feet in thickness, from 20 to 30 miles in breadth, and perhaps 80 miles 
in length, had been dissolved and mostly washed down the Hudson 
River. Fragments of every stratum lie thought were still to be found 
in small masses throughout the towns in the vicinity. The possibility 

" Concerning this Hall remarks ( Geology of Fourth District, p. 6): "It is a 
remarkable fact that at this early period Mr. Eaton should have recognized the sand- 
stone of the Catskill Mountains as the Old Red of Europe, which, now that we have 
identified its characteristic fossils, is proved to be true." 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY MAOLUREAN ERA, 1785—1819. 237 

of glacial drift was of course at that time wholly unrealized, and he 
accounted for the masses of granite and syenite, weighing from 1 to 
50 tons, which are scattered throughout the Connecticut River region, 
as residuary fragments from atmospheric decomposition. 

What force can have brought these masses from the western hills across a deep 
valley 700 feet lower than their present situation? Are we not compelled to say that 
this valley was once filled up so as to make a gradual descent from the Chesterfield 
range of granite, sienite, etc., to the top of Mount Tom? Then it would be easy to 
conceive of their being rolled down to the top of the greenstone, where we now find 
them. 

In this year Eaton published also his Conjectures Respecting the 
Formation of the Earth. In this, largely following Werner, he 
taught that the water now covering three-fourths of the earth's exterior 
was at one time thoroughly commingled with the solid materials con- 
stituting the globe in such a manner as to form a very thick paste. 
Such being the primary condition, the heaviest materials contained in 
this globular mass of mortar would soon begin slowly to settle together, 
the heaviest naturally at the center. Further, that such settling took 
place in inverse order of the specific gravities of particles, forming 
thus several concentric la} T ers of metals, arranged like the coats of an 
onion. This settling went on until finally granite was deposited, several 
thousand years being regarded as necessary for the completion of all 
the strata. Previous to the deposition of granite, gneiss, mica-slate, 
and other primitive rocks, neither animals nor vegetables were con- 
ceived to exist, for no traces of them have been discovered in the rocks 
of these types. 

As condensation went on, the water being disengaged from the inner 
deposits and forced gradually toward the exterior of the mass, the 
earth paste became more diluted, and a few zoophytes, shell animals, 
and cryptogamous plants were created, as was shown by the finding 
of their remains in the transition rocks overlying the primitive. 

The continued dilution of the water by the deposition of the mate- 
rials of the transition series was followed by the creation of several 
species of fish, and as the solution was thinner the deposits of the 
secondary rocks went on with considerable rapidity. During this 
time the red sandstone, compact limestone, and indurated marl were 
deposited, entombing incidentally individuals of the various plants 
and animals enumerated. 

While this secondary formation was going on the internal heat of the earth imme- 
diately beneath the granite, by converting the water which remained in the subter- 
ranean interstices into steam, began to raise up the rocks of granite. The expansion 
of this steam found relief by forcing its way wherever the least resistance was pre- 
sented, and as strata can be separated from each other easier than they can be broken 
through, the steam probably traveled laterally round the earth, separating the gran- 
ite from the next stratum below. At length the force of the more highly rarefied 
steam became too great to he any Longer confined within the coat of granite. Jt 
burst through at the weakest part and shot forth its craggy broken edges above the 
muddy waters which surrounded it. 



238 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Concerning the source of this heat, "whether it arose from the 
admixture and combustion of substances then abounding- beneath the 
granite," or whether "it was excited by the concentric layers of 
metallic plates serving as a vast galvanic battery," Eaton was non- 
committal. 

The projecting edges of granite, together with the uplifted strata of transition and 
secondary rocks, formed the first islands and continents of dry land. Alluvial 
deposits had already commenced under water, and therefore parts of the raised 
islands and continents were prepared for the reception and support of plants and 
animals of the more perfectly organized structure. 

These, however, were not the continents of the present day. which 
were conceived then to be at the bottom of the primeval ocean, but 
were rather the continents occupied by antediluvians, and which are 
now in their turn probably at the bottom of the Indian Ocean. This 
land, he argued 

may have been supported by the meeting place of two vast segments of uplifted 
granite which contained beneath them an immense subterranean sea. Our pres- 
ent continent may now be supported in the same way and the meeting of the edges 
of segments form the granitic ridge which extends from Georgia to the Frigid Zone — 
that is to say, that which forms the Appalachian Mountain system. 

In whatever manner the ancient world was supported, it is evident that when the 
wickedness of man drew down the vengeance of the Almighty, its foundations gave 
way and it sank to the bottom of the ocean never to be again uplifted. 

Incidental to this catastrophe, he conceived there may have been 
formed a "vacuum wherein much water might subside;" or possibly 
several continents falling in contemporaneously, basins were formed — 

sufficient to hold all the waters which had hitherto covered the continents of our 
day; or, perhaps, the pressure at the outer margins of the falling'continents might 
force up the granite, which raised our continents out of the ocean. * * * At any 
rate, the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and our continents, then at the 
bottom of the great deep, emerged into open day. While this tremendous crash of 
nature was going on, scales of various thicknesses from the various strata were shot 
up, detached and broken, which gave formation to our surrounding hills, the ragged 
cliffs of the Catskill and the bleak brow of the Andes. Some were formed at the 
bottom of the sea by volcanic fires; others have arisen from various causes since the 
great deep retired. 

This order of creation he conceived to be directly in accord with the 
account of Moses and the sinking of the ancient continent contempora- 
neous with the Noachian deluge. 

When the fountains of the great deep were broken up and the bottoms of those 
fountains became dry land, the ancient world became itself the bottom of the great 
deep in its turn. 

During this period all surviving animal life, both human and other- 
wise, was conceived as confined within the limits of Noah's ark, about 
one year elapsing from the time the sinking took place and the ark was 
Moated before the new earth was sufficiently dry for the occupants to 
disembark. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY MAOLUREAN ERA, 1785-1810. 239 

These conjectures, it will he observed, are not quite those of Werner, 
since the original paste constituting the globe must, according to Eaton, 
have been rather a mechanical admixture than a chemical solution. 
While the early stages of precipitation, whereby the heaviest mate- 
rials were deposited in the form of concentric layers of metals, might 
be suggestive of a condition of solution or aqueo-igneous fusion, the 
subsequent deposition of the secondary rocks, which are so plainly 
fragmental, leaves us to conclude that he regarded the primary condi- 
tion as that of a mechanical mixture or emulsion. 

Eaton in his index deviated somewhat from Werner's classification 
also in that he placed the argillaceous slates in the transition rather 
than in the primitive class." 

The year 1819 was signalized by the organization, in the philosoph- 
ical room of Yale College, of the American Geological Society, the 
tirst American society devoted mainly to geological and allied subjects. 
Though this continued in existence only until the end 
s\£fe r ty a mT logica ' of 1828, it was productive of much good in stimulating 
workers throughout the country. Maclure was elected 
president, with Colonel Gibbs, Professor Silliman, Professor Cleave- 
land, Stephen Elliott, R. Gilmor, S. Brown, and Robert Hare, vice- 
presidents. Among the more prominent members were Akerly, 
Bruce. Cornelius, S. L. and J. F. Dana, Dewey, Eaton, Godon. 
Hitchcock, Mitchill, Ratinesque, Schoolcraft, and Steinhauer, while 
the names of Emmons, Harlan, Lea. Morton, Troost, and Vanuxem 
appear among the younger and then less prominent workers. 

The society published nothing and has left little that is tangible to 
tell of its existence, though Eaton, in the second edition of his Index 
to the Geology of the Northern States, makes the following interesting 
comment concerning its personnel: 

The president of the American Geological Society, "William M'Clure, esq., has 
already struck out the grand outline of North American geographical geology. The 
first vice-president, Col. G. Gibbs, has collected more facts and amassed more geolog- 
ical and mineralogical specimens than any other individual of the age. The second 
vice-president, Professor Silliman, his learned and indefatigable colleague in these 
labors, gives the true scientific dress to all the naked mineralogical subjects, which 
are furnished to his hand. The third vice-president, Professor Cleaveland, is suc- 
cessfully employed in elucidating and familiarizing those interesting sciences; and 
thus smoothing the rugged paths of the student Professor Mitchill has amassed a 
large store of materials, and annexed them to the labors of Cuvier and Jameson. 
But the drudgery of climbing cliffs and descending into fissures and caverns and ul 
traversing in all directions our most rugged mountainous districts to ascertain the 
distinctive characters, number, and order of our strata has devolved on me. I make 
no pretensions to any peculiar qualifications other than that bodily health and con- 
stitutional fitness for labor ami fatigue which such an employment requires. 



"Silliman in his review of the work (American Journal of Science, I, 1819, p. 
70) called attention to the fact that the clay slate may belong either to primitive, 
transition, or secondary formations. He also questioned if the West Stockbridge 
marble should not be regarded as primitive rather than metalliferous.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



During the years 1818 and 1819 Henry R. Schoolcraft made a trip 

throughout what is now known as the lead region of the Mississippi 

Valley, and in November of the last-named year published, in the 

form of an octavo volume of some 300 paeres, a book 

Schoolcraft's 

Explorations, entitled A View of the Lead Mines of Missouri; 

Including Some Observations on the Mineralogy, 
Geology, Geography, Antiquities, Soil, Climate, Population, and Pro- 
ductions of Missouri and Arkansas and Other Sections of the Western 
Country. The work contained little of geological importance, the 
purport of the trip being mainly to study the lead deposits of the 
region. He described the whole mineral country as "bottomed" on 
primitive limestone, though he found quartz rock and later sand rock 
very common in the southern section of the Arkansas country. Sec- 
ondary limestone was also met with, but was far less common than in 

Ohio, Indiana, Connecticut, and Illinois, 
the ore itself being found in the decompo- 
sition products from the primitive lime- 
stone. He mentioned the occurrence of 
granite in Washington and Madison coun- 
ties, also greenstone porphyry and iron 
ore, and correct^ described the granite as 
being the only mass of its kind known to 
exist between the primitive ranges of the 
Allegheny and Rocky mountains, being sur- 
rounded on all sides and to an almost 
immeasurable extent with secondary lime- 
stone. He gave also a descriptive catalogue 
of the minerals found in the State. Among 
them mention was made of the Hint from 
Girardeau County, several varieties of quartz, including the Arkansas 
novaculite; a red pipestone from the Falls of St. Anthony, which is 
evidently the catlinite of more recent writers, but which he called stea- 
tite; and other minerals, including baryte, nuorite, blende, antimony, 
native copper, etc. He described briefly the micaceous iron ore of 
Iron Mountain, the coal found near Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, and other 
minerals which need not be mentioned in detail. 

Schoolcraft was one of those all-round naturalists and investigators 
such as could exist only in the early days of science, when it was pos- 
sible for one mind to embrace or include all knowledge, keep track of 
its development, and at the same time aid in its advancement. A man 
apparently of more than ordinary vigor, daring, and perseverence, he 
early became interested in the work of exploration, his Held being, 
however, limited mainly to the Mississippi Valley and the region of 
the Great Lakes. His geological work was purely of the reconnais- 
sance type, but was of the greatest value in the then existing condi- 
tion of knowledge regarding the regions visited, the lead regions of the

Mississippi Valley and the copper regions of Lake Superior both prof- 
iting by his labors. 

Being brought in contact with the aborigines and realizing the 
rapidity with which they were becoming contaminated through con- 




tact with the whites, he was drawn into a study of the Indian tribes 
of North America, to which work, after 1822, he gave up a large por- 
tion of his time, The main work of his life lies, therefore, quite 
outside the limits of the present paper.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



In 1820 Schoolcraft, acting under direction of Governor Lewis Cass, 
of Michigan, who was himself acting under authority of the then Sec- 
retary of War, made a trip along the Great Lakes and to the sources 




of the Mississippi)!, the results of which, with general notes on the 
natural history of the region, were published the year following. 



AMKRICAN GEOLOGY MAOLUREAN ERA, 1785-181!). 



243 



In 1821 he was a member of a second expedition authorized by the 
General Government to explore the central portions of the Mississippi 
Valley, the results of which were published in 1825. In 1822 he also 
reported to the General Government on the extent and value of the 
mineral lands on Lake Superior, and again in 1832 " resumed and 
completed" his explorations of the sources of the Mississippi, his 
results appearing- in book form in 1855. 

The expedition of 1820 (See map, fig. 7) started at Detroit and made 
its way northward along the western shores of lakes St. Clair and 
Huron to the Straits of Michilimackinac, thence northward through 
St. Marys River and along the south shore of Lake Superior to Fond 
du Lac, up the St. Louis River, and down the Savannah to Sand}- 
Lake and lakes Winnipeg and Cassina farther north. The return trip 
was made down the Mississippi to the lead region near Dubuque, Iowa, 
and thence northeasterly up the Wisconsin River to Green Bay. where

the party divided, a portion going to Michilimackinac (now Mackinac), 
along the northern and eastern shores, and the rest keeping to the 
south, to Chicago, and eastward and north till the starting point was 
reached once more, one section of the party, with Governor Cass, leav- 
ing the lake near the southeastern end (at the mouth of the River du 
Schmein) and going overland to Detroit. 

The narrative of the expedition of 1820 abounds with mineralogical 
and geological notes, which are in large part, however, of a supposed 
economic nature. The occurrence of gypsum at St. Martins Island 
was noted, the island of Michilimackinac itself being of ''transition 
and compact 11 limestone. A colored section was given showing the 
relative position of granite and overlying sandstone between Presque 
Isle and Garlic River (tig. !>). The sandstone he described as overlap- 
ping the granite and fitting into its irregularities in a manner that 
"shows it to have assumed that position subsequently to the upheav- 
ing of the granite." The age of this sand rock lie was unable to satis- 



244 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

factorily determine, though its position seemed to him to indicate a 
near alliance to the " Old red sandstone.'' a 

He described the finding of the large block of native copper (now in 
the IT. S. National Museum in Washington), upon the edge of the 
Ontonagon River, giving a picture and offering some remarks on the 
probable origin of the same. In his report to Secretary J. C. Cal- 
houn, under this same date, made with reference to the copper mines 
of Lake Superior, Schoolcraft dwelt in some detail upon the occur- 
rence of frequent masses of drift copper, but stated that no body of 
the metal sumcientl} T extensive to mine profitably had been discovered. 
He, however, regarded it as probable that a more intimate knowledge 
of the resources of the country might result in the discovery of valu- 
able ores of copper, in the working of which ""occasional masses and 
veins of the native metal may materially enhance the advantage of 
mining." This prediction, it is scarcely necessary to say, has been 
abundantly verified. 

Writing on the prevailing theories as to the origin and distribution 
of metals and gems, he remarked, "There is no reason that can be 
drawn from philosophical investigations to prove that these substances 
may not be abundantly found in the climates of the north, even upon 
the banks of the frozen ocean," their distribution being apparently 
wholly independent of climatic conditions. 

The Dubuque lead ore he described as occurring in detached masses 
in the ocherous alluvial soil resting upon a calcareous rock referable 
to the Transition class (in the revision of his work, published in 1832, 
he made this Carboniferous), and also in veins penetrating the rock. 
The relationship existing between the rock and the residual clay did 
not seem, however, to have been recognized/ 

The presence of extensive beds of coal about 40 miles southwest of 
Chicago, on the Fox River, was noted. The fact that bricks, made 
from clay occurring near Chicago, turned white was* also noted, and 
explained on the ground that they were lacking in iron oxides/ 

In his "Travels" Schoolcraft advanced the idea that there had been 
at some former period an obstruction in the channel of the Mississippi 
River at or near Grand Tower, in southern Illinois, whereby there 
was produced a stagnation of the current at an elevation of about L30 

" The correct position of this sandstone remained long a matter of doubt and dis- 
pute. It is now considered as of Potsdam age. 

f > Since this mode of occurrence was referred to by subsequent explorers, it may be 
well to state here that the ore was originally in the limestone, from which it was 
liberated by decomposition and left to accumulate in the residual clay, representing 
the insoluble constituents. 

'This has since been shown to be an error. These clays contain as much iron as 
others that may burn red. It is probable that, in the process of tiring, this iron coin- 
bines to form an iron-linie-magnesian silicate and is not oxidized to the extent of 
imparting the common brick-red color. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY MACLUREAN ERA, 1785-1819. 245 

feet above the present ordinary watermark. This was made sufficiently 
evident to him by the general elevation and direction of the hills, which 
for several hundred miles above are separated by a valley from 20 to 
25 miles wide. Wherever these hills disclosed rocky and precipitous 
fronts a series of distinctly-marked old water lines were observed. 
The Grand Tower and the contiguous promontories were regarded as 
but the dilapidated remains of this barrier. On the breaking away of 
the obstructions the water gradually receded into existing channels, by 
which the inland sea was gradually drained. 

One of the most curious features of this paper lies in his pronounced 
acceptation of the accuracy of the various reports relative to the find- 
ing of living animals embedded in rocks of considerable geological 
antiquity. He mentioned the finding at Carthage, on the Genesee, of 
twelve or fifteen frogs embedded in a layer of packed clay marl about 
9 feet below the surface, where they had apparently been buried since 
the diluvial era; also the finding of one in a geode in the Niagara lime- 
stone at Lockport. As bearing upon the same subject, he gave in his 
addenda a series of accounts of the finding of various living animals 
under equally impossible conditions, which he seems to accept without 
question. 

In 1819-20 Maj. Stephen H. Long, under the direction of John C. 
Calhoun, Secretary of War, made an expedition from Pittsburg to 
the Rocky Mountains. With him were associated Thomas Say, 
entomologist, and Edwin James, botanist and geolo- 
mf-2o Expediti ° n ' gist. The accounts of the expedition, compiled by 
Mr. .Tames, contain numerous references to the geol- 
ogy of the region, which are of interest, considering the time at which 
they were made. The route of the expedition la} T from Pittsburg 
down the Ohio to its mouth, up the Mississippi to St. Louis, and 
northwestward to Council Bluffs; thence westward along the Platte 
and South Platte to a point a little west of the one hundred and fifth 
meridian and north of the thirty-fifth parallel; across to the Arkansas, 
which was followed down to a point a little east of the one hundred 
and fourth meridian, where the party divided, one returning by the 
Arkansas and the other by the Canadian River. 

The reports on geology were, naturally, largely tinged with Werner- 
ism. It was noted that, in the vicinity of the Rocky Mountains, only 
Secondary rocks occurred, Transition forms being entirely lacking. He 
noted, first, the occurrence of red sandstone resting immediatel}' on the 
granite, rather indistinctly stratified, the strata sometimes inclined and 
sometimes horizontal; second, argillaceous or gray sandstone overlying 
the red and conforming to it in its inclination and carrying sometimes 
coal and iron; third, floetz trap, including greenstone and amygdaloid; 
and fourth, sand and gravel restingon thesandstones and extending over 
the Great Desert, this latter material being recognized as a product of

the disintegration of the primitive rocks of the mountains and which he 
thought "to have been deposited at a very remote period when the waters 




of the primeval ocean covered the level of the Great Plain and the 
lower regions of the granitic mountains.' 1 The inclined position of 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY MAOLUREAN ERA, 1785-1819. 247 

some of those Secondary rocks in the immediate vicinity of the moun- 
tains was noted, but some difficulty found in accounting for the same. 
"Subsequent to the deposition of these horizontally stratified rocks," 
he wrote, ""their position has been somewhat changed, either by the 
action of some force beneath the primitive rocks, forcing them up to 
a greater elevation than they formerly possessed, or by the sinking 
down of the Secondary, produced by the operation of some cause 
equally unknown.' 1 This matter he again referred to, thinking it pos- 
sible, though scarcely probable, that the great and abrupt change in 
the inclination of the strata in the parts near the granite might be due 
to the gradual wearing away by the agency of rivers of some portion 
of the sandstone, and that those rocks now found in an inclined position 
were detached portions of what was formerly the upper part of the 
strata which, having been undermined on their eastern side and sup- 
ported by the granite on the western side, had fallen into their present 
position. 

The presence of coal beds in the region of the Ozark Mountains was 
noted, and the associated limestones were set down as of Carbonifer- 
ous age, as was also the limestone of the region of the lead mines. 

An important suggestion was made relative to the possibility of 

obtaining water through bore holes sunk in the arid tract lying west 

of the Ozark Mountains. "It is not improbable," he wrote, "that 

the strata of many parts of this secondary formation

horizontal to an inclined position, in consequence of 
which the water that falls in dew and rains in the hill}* districts, be- 
coming insinuated between curved stratifications, may descend toward 
the center of the formation under such circumstances as would insure 
its rising to the surface through well or bore holes sunk sufficiently 
to penetrate the veins." 

The rocks of the Allegheny Mountains were classified as granular 
limestone, metalliferous limestones, transition, argillite, and sandstone. 
The report was accompanied by a volume of plates, which included 
geological sections on the thirty-fifth and forty -first parallels (tig. 11). 
These were intended to form continuations of Maclure's third and 
fifth sections, already noted (p. 228). 

The second volume of Silliman's American Journal of Science, issued 

this year, had a long article by the editor — Sketches of a Tour in the 

Counties of New Haven and Litchfield, Conn., with notices of the 

Geology, Mineralogy, and Scenery — in which are de-

siiiiman, Olmsted, scribed the various rocks passed over, among others 
the ''primitive white marble" near New Milford. 
He described this as "a perfectly distinct bed in gneiss, which is found 
on both sides of it, and, of course, both above and below it." a sensible 
admixture of the two rocks being perceptible for some feet on both 
sides of the junction.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



Just what Silliman's preconceived opinions may have been is not 
apparent, but he remarked in a satisfied way that the associations 
were exactly what he had anticipated. 




The geological relations of the marble appear to have been perfectly distinct, 
* * * and give us new reason to admire that wonderful order and harmony, little 
expected by people in general, which are found equally in the mineral kingdom as

in the animal and vegetable, and which afforded on analogical grounds the best rea- 
son to predict that the geological association of this marble would be found to be 
what it actually is. 

In the district are nearly all the important primitive rocks of Verneuil, while New 
Hampshire includes a considerable portion of his secondary formations. 

Iii the same Journal, Denison Olmsted, then at Chapelhill, in North 
Carolina, announced the discovery of a red sandstone formation in 
North Carolina, which he had traced through the counties of Orange 
and Chatham, with a breadth, in one instance at least, of about 7 miles. 

Caleb Atwater, in the same volume, noted the occurrence of ancient 
human bones, together with those of a mastodon or mammoth in Ohio, 
which indicated to his mind that the whole country had at one time 
been covered with water, which had made it "one vast cemetery of 
the beings of former ages." 

In August, 1819, Dr. Samuel Akerly, who is first mentioned on page 
223, read before the New York Lyceum an essay on the geology of 
the Hudson River and vicinity. This was published the year follow- 
ing in the form of a small duodecimo volume of 69

the country from the neighborhood or bandy Hook, 
New Jersey, northward through the Highlands in New York toward 
the Catskills. This section is mainly interesting as being the second 
attempt of its kind, being preceded by Eaton's transverse section from 
the Catskills to the Atlantic by only two years. The work consisted 
mainly of descriptive details relating to the lithological character of 
the various formations, and contained little else of value. Akerly was 
a disciple of Mitchill, whom he followed implicitly. He, however, 
questioned the Old Red Sandstone age of the Connecticut River sand- 
stones, on account of bones of land animals having been found beneath 
them at Nyack. Since, however, credence is given to the reported 
finding of pine knots, earthen vessels, iron instruments, corn cobs, etc., 
under these same sandstones, and an iron instrument resembling a 
pipe in the anthracite coal of Rhode Island, little weight can be given 
even to his doubts.

CHAPTER II. 

THE EATONIAN ERA, 1820-1829. 

According to Amos Eaton, 1820 marked the close of the first era of 
American geology. Accepting this, it may well be called the Maclur- 
ean era. The second, including the decade 1820-1829, may with equal 
propriety be called the Eatonian era, since Eaton was the most promi- 
nent worker as well as most profuse writer of the decade. In so doing, 
however, we must not overlook the fact that Eaton was favored with 
unusual opportunities, owing to the munificence of the Hon. Stephen 
Van Rensselaer and that he, himself, would perhaps have called it the 
Rensselaerian era. 

The era opened with promise, and though the results as apparent 
on paper were not great, yet much was actually accomplished. It was, 
so to speak, a transition period, one in which the possibilities of State 
and Governmental surveys were seriously considered, and one, too, in 
which, so far as America was concerned, there was made the first sys- 
tematic attempt at correlation by means of fossils. We meet, too, 
during this interval the first really satisfactory suggestion as to the 
source of the glacial drift, the first recognition of overturned folds 
and the possibility of the repetition of strata through faulting and dis- 
placement. The cosmogonists had largely disappeared and in their 
place were men who had learned to first observe and then deduce 
according to their understanding of the observed phenomena. 

In 1820 Eaton published a second edition of his Index in the form 
of a small octavo volume of 286 pages. In this many of the earlier 
opinions were restated with little, if any, modification. His views rel- 
ative to the origin of the continents were illustrated 
i^on^ndlx n i O 820. D .Y tne P late here reproduced, but the source of the 
energy which resulted in the elevation of the continents 
was still unexplained. He asserted: 

That the rents made by the grand explosion, which first upturned and disfigured 
the rocky crust of the earth, were in a north and south direction. That those cross- 
ing the forty-second degree of north latitude were principally made at the Pyrenees 
and Alps in Europe, Caucasus, Tartary, and China in Asia. Rocky Mountain and 
New England in America. 

Whether this theory accords with the real origin of the present state of things or 
not is immaterial. It is introduced solely for the purpose of aiding the memory in 
studying the strata which we know do exist. 

251 



252 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

His views regarding- the formation of eaves in limestone were prim- 
itive and highly interesting: 

When the waters of the ocean retired, the calcareous cement which now holds the 
shelly together was in a state of soft paste. * * * After the waters retired the 
parts exposed to the sun's rays hegan to harden, contract, and crack into blocks. 
In some parts of the Heldeberg these blocks are of great extent, but I have seen 
acres of it where the stratum is very thin, checkered up into blocks from 2 to 10 feet 
square. Where the stratum is very thick and the fissures very long, large caverns 
were frequently formed, for the upper surface of the stratum was soon dried and 
indurated, while the whole remained soft a long time a few feet below the surface. 
If a stream of water happened to flow in the vicinity of the fissure, it would prob- 
ably make its way into it and soon wash away the loose shells beneath the surface, 
which were merely enveloped in soft calcareous paste. 

And further: 

I have examined four of the largest caverns in the Heldeberg, and they all still 
exhibit conclusive evidence of their having been once in the state of mere fissures, 
and streams of water still traverse them all. 

The majority of readers of to-day need scarcety be told that these 
limestone caves are formed wholly by a process of solution, by surface 
waters acting upon the strata only after they had reached, essentially, 
their present position and condition of induration. The streams of 
water which are found traversing the caves are incidental and conse- 
quent rather than causative. 

His views on the formation of stalactitic iron ore, as exemplified in 
the Salisbury mine, are equally interesting. The ore, he believed to 
have been at one time specular iron imbedded in the talco-micaceous 
rock, and deposited in its present form from a state of fusion as recent 
as the time when the "Alluvion'''' was formed. 

These stalactites are always suspended from masses intermixed with the soil in 
such a manner that it is evident the iron was in a state of fusion when in contact 
with it. The foot, which still adheres to all stalactitic specimens, proves that the 
heat was continued after the ore was confined in its present state. If it was ever 
fused down from any rock, it must have been the same out of which the alluvion 
embracing it was formed. The cause producing such a high heat I shall not attempt 
to assign; but that the ore exhibits sufficient evidence of its having been recently 
fused, I believe no one can question who has ever inspected it in place. 

The reader of to-day need here also scarcely be told that all the 
peculiarities thus described were due not to heat, but to deposition 
from solution. 

His views regarding man}- phenomena were, naturally, largely a 
reflection of those held by European authorities. In fact, one of the 
most striking features which impresses itself upon the reader of these 
early works is the attempt manifested by all to correlate the various 
formations, not of America alone, but American with European, on 
purely lithological grounds. If a specimen of sandstone, schist, or 
whatever it might be, resembled another from a different source, no 
matter how distant, this was considered evidence of its belonging to 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY EATONIAN ERA, 1820-1829. 253 

the .same formation. This method of correlation did not wholly dis- 
appear among American workers for many years, although Marcou 
was probably its latest ardent apostle. Eaton himself made an 
attempt to break away from it in his later work, as will be noted. 

In the work under discussion the crystalline limestone or granular 
limestone and quartz, calcareous and granular quartz, and metalliferous 
limestone of the first edition were regarded as all belonging to one 
and the same stratum, but the position of this limestone, as shown 
near the east line of Danbury, Connecticut, confused him. 

Here the layers dip to the west; but in West Stockbridge and Alford they gen- 
ally dip to the east, though there seems to be no conformity in their direction. 
Had some force, applied at the eastern edge, raised these mountain masses from the 
horizontal toward the vertical position, leaving some inclined to the east and forcing 
others beyond a vertical position, they would have presented their present inclination. 

This is the first suggestion of anything resembling an overturned 
fold which had thus far been made. He was correct in his observa- 
tions, but the science had not sufficiently advanced to enable him to 
realize the possibilities. It will be noted, too, that he was working 
in a region, the correct interpretation of which has been a source of 
dispute for nearly three-quarters of a century. The glacial drift was, 
as in the first edition of his work, still classed as alluvial, and the 
materials composing Long Island and the coastal plain were regarded 
as of a common origin. 

Eaton made use of Le Due and Jameson's awkward name of Geest to 
include the "most universal of all strata,'"' which was found occupying 
"every inch of dry land which is neither naked rock nor covered with 
alluvion," and the character of which "is generally indicated by the 
rock upon which it lies and by those which have recently disappeared." 
Although thus denned, in his attempt to outline its distribution he 
failed to discriminate between the true residual material and that 
which is drift. 

What he had to sa}' on the subject of organic relics or fossils was 
merely an adaptation from Martin's Systema reliquiorum. He classi- 
fied these relics under two heads, petrifactions and conservatives. The 
petrifactions or substitutions, as he sometimes called them, were "those 
relics which are entirely made up of mineral substances, which have 
graduall} 7 run into the places occupied by organized bodies, as those 
bodies decayed, and assumed their forms." The conservatives or pres- 
ervations, on the other hand, were " those relics or parts thereof which 
still consist of the very same substances which originally composed the 
living, organized being." 

These relics were named by annexing the termination Uthos, a stone, 
to the scientific name of the living organism; as, for instance, a fossil 
fish would be ichthyolithos, though the terminology in English he 
often modified from lithos to lite. Adopting this nomenclature, he 



254 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

grouped all organic relics under nine heads, as follows: Genus I, 
Mammodolite; Genus II, Ornitholite; Genus III, Amphibiolite; Genus 
IV, Ichthyolite; Genus V, Entomolite; Genus VI, Helmintholite; 
Genus VII, Concholite; Genus VIII, Erismatolite; Genus IX, 
Phytolite. 

In 1821 Eaton was employed by S. Van Rensselaer to make a geo- 
logical and agricultural survey of Rensselaer County, New York. His 
report, printed in 1822, formed an octavo pamphlet of 70 pages, and 

was accompanied b} r a geological section, extending 
Ren°sseiaef u county° f f rom the Onondaga Salt Springs across the county to 

Williams College in Massachusetts. The first thirty 
pages of the report were given up to discussions of the character and 
distribution of the various kinds of rocks and soils, and the remainder 
to methods of culture and an agricultural calendar. 

The rocks of the county, as well as those of Washington County on 
the north and of Columbia County on the south, were regarded as chiefly 
belonging to the transition formations. Secondary limerock resting 
on the graywacke was found in Schaghticoke about four miles east of 
the Hudson and in the northern part of Greenbush. As to whether 
the argillite along the eastern margin of the county was transition or 
primary, he was in doubt. As with his contemporaries, he based his 
opinions largely upon lithological data, quite failing to realize that 
rocks of widely varying age may more or less resemble each other, 
according to local conditions and the amount of metamorphism they 
may have undergone. Passing westward from Williams College, the 
various rocks met with, as shown in his section, and described are (1) 
granular and primitive limestone, (2) metalliferous or transition lime- 
stone, (3) argillite, (4) metalliferous limestone again, (5) a second band 
of argillite, (6) graywacke with sporadic patches of (7) compact second- 
ary limestone, (8) secondary or calcareous sandstone, and (9) argillaceous 
gra} T wacke, semi-indurated argillite, and clay slate. The first three 
were represented with steep westerly dips passing under the gray- 
wacke, which constitutes the principal formation. 

On November 17, 1820, the Hon. J. B. Gibson read a paper before 
the American Philosophical Societ} 7 , which was published in the 
Transactions of that year, on the trap rocks of the Conewago Hills 

near Middletown, Dauphin County, and Stony Ridge 
TrapRock S T82o n near Carlisle, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. He 

described the mode of weathering into bowlders, and 
rightly argued that such was due wholly to atmospheric agencies and 
did not indicate an original concretionary structure. He seemed to 
regard the columnar structure in this class of rocks as due. also to 
decomposition, mentioning as an example the columns of the Giant's 
Causeway, "which exhibit regular prismatic form only when it has 
long been exposed to the action of the atmosphere." 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY EATONIAN ERA, 1820-1829. 255 

He did not regard the trap of the Conewago Hills as igneous, but 
that of Stony Hill presented to him an appearance more decisively 
volcanic. This did not, however, necessarily mean that there may 
have once existed a crater here. 

These observations of Gibson relative to the mode of decomposition 
of the trappean rock are of interest when taken in connection with 
observations of other individuals of about this period in North 
Carolina. 

It appears that the attention of the Rev. James Hall and Zachariah 
Lewis had been called to what are now known to be small trappean 
dikes on the Yadkin River, near Salisbury, which had undergone 
decomposition into small bowlder-like masses. The fact that these 
dikes had at one time occupied rifts in older rocks which had largely 
disappeared through decomposition, leaving them standing in wall- 
like masses, entirely escaped the observation of the two gentlemen 
named, and they were consequently described as probably of human 
workmanship. 

In response to a request of Dr. Samuel L. Mitchill, Mr. John Beck- 
with made an examination of the occurrences and reported the result 
in a letter printed in the American Journal of Science for 1822. 
Beckwith described in considerable detail the occurrence of the dikes 
and the stages of transition from the solid bowlder-like masses to the 
supposed interstitial cement. While apparently not realizing com- 
pletely the fact that their then appearance might be due to decompo- 
sition, his description is such as to leave no doubt in the mind of the 
present reader. As to the exact character of the material itself, he 
was somewhat at a loss, but, on the whole, inclined to believe it to be 
basaltic, though perhaps of aqueous rather than igneous origin. 

The work of Thomas Nuttall merits attention here only on account 
of the time of its accomplishment. Nuttall himself was not a geolo- 
gist, nor can he be considered an American. His principal work was 
of a botanical and ornithological nature, the paper, 

Nuttall's . . & ' il \ 

observations, Observations on the Geological Structure of the Valley 

of the Mississippi, being his sole contribution to the 
literature of geology. This was read before the Philadelphia Academy 
in December, 1820, and in its printed form occupies 38 pages of the 
journal of the society. 

Nuttall's travels took him along the southern shore of Lake Erie to 
Detroit; thence by canoe along the coast of Lake Huron to Michili- 
mackinac; thence southwestward to Green Bay, Wisconsin, and by way 
of the Fox and Wisconsin (Ouisconsin) rivers to the Mississippi, near 
Prairie du Chien, and southward to St. Louis. This and other trips 
up the Missouri and Arkansas rivers gave him ample opportunity for 
such superficial observations as he was competent to make These 
observations consisted largely of conjectures as to the geographic 



256 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

limits of the secondary formations, which he found here to consist 
mainly of limestone strongly resembling the mountain limestone of 
Derbyshire in England, and he announced himself as "fully satisfied 
that almost every fossil shell figured and described in the Petritica 
Derbiensia of Martin " was to be met with throughout the great cal- 
careous platform of the Mississippi Valley. The limits and character 
of the "Ancient Marine Alluvium," its fossil and mineral contents 
were discussed; the essay concluding with some observations on the 
Transition Mountains of Arkansas, with brief notes on the hone slate 
of Washita. 

In 1820 there appeared also H. H. Hayden's Geological Essays. 
These are of especial interest as dealing particularly with the Tertiary 
and more recent alluvial deposits of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, form- 
ing what is now known as the coastal plain. The work 
"mo en ' s Essays ' is verbose in the extreme and more argumentative than 
logical. Indeed, were it not for its historical interest 
and for the light which is thrown upon the crudities of early observa- 
tion and deduction, it would be scarcely worth considering at all. 

After referring to the geographical limits of this coastal plain, as 
defined and mapped by Maclure, and combating the opinions of pre- 
vious observers [including Latrobe, Stoddard, and others] to the effect 
that it was formed by flood tides and the winds acting on materials 
cast up by the sea or through the transporting powers of the great 
rivers, Hayden proceeded to elaborate his own theories in a way as 
ingenious as it now seems improbable. "Viewing the subject in all 
its bearings, there is no circumstance that affords so strong evidence 
of the cause of the formation (i. e., the coastal plain) as that of its 
having been deposited by a general current, which at some unknown 
period flowed impetuously across the whole continent of America, and 
that from northeast to southwest." The course of this current he 
assumed depended on that of the general current of the Atlantic 
Ocean, the waters of which rose to such a height that "it overran its 
ancient limits and spread desolation on its adjacent shores. 1 ' 

In seeking a cause for this general current the author referred, first, 
to the seventh chapter of the book of Genesis, "For yet seven days, 
and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights, 
and every living substance that I hav< made will I destroy from off the 
face of the earth." He then proceeded to show the inadequacy of this 
cause alone; the water being thus equally distributed over the ocean 
and the land, there "could be no tendency to cause a current in the 
former." Some other cause must therefore be sought, and fortu- 
nately his imagination proved equal to the task. 

Accepting as probable the suggestion of "a writer of no common 
celebrity," presumably Kirwan, to the effect that the cause of the 
general deluge was the melting of the ice at the two poles of the earth, 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY EATONIAN ERA, 1820-1829. 257 

and that this was occasioned by the sun deviating from the ecliptic, he 
proceeded to explain in his own way how this might be brought about, 
though acknowledging that no positive testimony could possibly be 
adduced to substantiate the fact. 

Having admitted the possibility of the earth's changing its position 
so that the sun would pass "immediately. over the two poles upon an 
unknown meridian.'" he showed that there would then result a rapid 
dissolution of the existing ice caps, such as would yield an ample sup- 
ply of material, it. being only necessary to give it direction. Consid- 
ering as essential to the problem only the northern hemisphere, he 
remarked that from this polar cap there are but two outlets — the one 
into the Pacific Ocean through the narrow Bering Strait and the other 
through the wider channel between Greenland and Lapland into the 
Atlantic. Hence, when the melting ensued, by far the larger vol- 
ume of water passed into the latter ocean. 

No sooner was this operation established, ami this accession of strength and power 
thrown into the Atlantic Ocean in particular, than its tide be^an to rise above its 
common limits accompanied by a consequent current, both constantly increasing, 
the one in height and the other in rapidity, proportioned to the increase of power at 
the focus. * * * At the commencement of this frightful drama the current, it is 
highly probable, was divided by the craggy heights of Spitsbergen and a part thrown 
into the White Sea, while the other was thrown back upon the eastern ami southern 
coast of Greenland, and from thence in a southwestern direction until it struck the 
southeastern coast of Labrador, along which it swept through- the straits of Belle 
Isle, across Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and along the Atlantic coast into the Gulf 
of Mexico. * In a short space of time, the southern and eastern coast of 

Labrador, over which this current was urged with increasing force, was desolated. 
The soil * * was hurled adrift and * * * carried across the country into 

the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and across a part of New England i»to the sea, or general 
current of the ocean. Continuing to rise, the waters swept across Davis Strait and 
rolled their tumultuous surges into Hudson Bay, embracing the whole coast of Lab- 
rador, while the unequal current of the St. Lawrence was forced hack and upward to 
its parent source. * * * 

At length the floods of the pole forming a junction with Barnns Bay and the Arc- 
tic Sea, defying all bounds, overran their ancient limits and hurled their united 
forces, in dread confusion, across the bleak regions of the north to consummate the 
awful scene. Thus lakes and seas uniting formed one common ocean which was 
propelled with inconceivable rapidity across the continent between the great chain 
of mountains into the Gulf of Mexico and probably over the unpeopled wilds of 
South America into the Southern Ocean. Fulfilled in this way were the awful 
denunciations of an offended God, by the sure extermination of every beast of the 
field and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the face of the earth. 

The argument used to substantiate or in favor of the probability of 
the above causes can not be dwelt upon here. But to these causes he 
believed to be due not merely the alluvial deposits of the coastal plain, 
but as well the barrenness of soil of the rocks in Labrador and the 
northeastern portion of the continent, and also the general phenomena 
of the glacial drift, the bowlders of the latter being conceived as 
transported by floating ice.

While all this was taking - place on the American continent, the 
material supplied by the melting- of the south Polar ice cap was tind- 
ing- its way northward over Asia, carrying" with it to northern Siberia 
the mammoth, rhinoceros, and other gigantic animal remains now 
there found. In this last, it will be observed, he followed Pallas. 

The opinion held by many to the effect that the deltas of rivers 
were composed exclusively of alluvion brought down in the course of 
time and deposited at their mouths, he regarded as "a flagrant dere- 
liction from truth and every principle of sound reasoning and estab- 
lished fact." Such he regarded as formed in part of natural alluvion 
of the rivers, in part of wind-blown sand and dust, and in part of waste 
from the fields due to cultivation and the cutting away of forests. 
Thus early he recognized the importance of man as a geological agent, 
and also that of the wind. He nowhere in the whole 150 pages of 
the discussion, however, recognized the now well-known fact that 
deltas are formed only at the mouths of rivers emptying into tide- 
less seas. 

Strangely enough, although one of the earliest to recognize the 
extent and importance of the alluvial formations. Hayden seems to 
have had very hazy notions regarding the origin of their materials. 
The belief held by many to the effect that ever} r species of rock is 
liable to a slow but progressive form of disintegration and decomposi- 
tion was to him rank heresy, as '■'tantamount to a libel against the 
letter and spirit of Holy Writ." Not but that some rocks may indeed 
decompose, such as the "micaceous schistus," but "granite and other 
rocks of like nature, where the quartz feldspar and mica are perfectly 
combined, are practically indestructible;" and the arguments he used 
to prove this are precisely those used to-day to prove the rapidity of 
the destructive process — that is, the evidence furnished by old stone 
monuments and buildings. Blinded by his religious prejudices and 
preconceived notions, he refused to accept proof of such decay, even 
when confronted by it in unmistakable forms, referring to such as but 
the " debris of the incompact or imperfectly formed mass that served as 
the covering, as it were, of the rocks, and which, being destitute of 
a cement, had fallen away to sand/''' 

Even that "the soil which covers the face of the earth was produced 
by the disintegration of rocks'' was to him an opinion unfounded 
both in natural as well as in moral philosophy, and betrayed a want 
of attention to the plans of the Omnipotent. "Who can or will con- 
tend that the mountains of our earth are becoming more and more 
depressed by the disintegration of the rocks of which they are com- 
posed? * * * Fortunately, however, it is not so. The Great 
Author of Nature intended it otherwise, and they are, and ever have 
been, the same in height, in all human probability, that they were 
from the commencement of time."'

Harden was the first to suggest the name Ternary for formations 
of alluvial origin and more recent than the secondary. The secondary 
formations he regarded as " the results of a natural operation;" that 
is, as natural deposits from water, probably in a state of perfect tran- 
quility. The alluvial, on the other hand, were the results of "acci- 
de n tal operations . * ' 

These essays were very favorably reviewed by Silliman in the third 
volume (1821) of his journal, even the idea of the fusion of the polar ice 
cap being allowed to pass with no more serious criticism than to suggest 
that the flood of waters might have been produced through the expul- 
sion of the same from cavities in the earth. J. E. De Kay. writing in 
1828. ventured, however, to. take exception to some of the expressed 
views regarding drift bowlders. He wisely suggested that since the 
speculative part of geology is but a series of hypotheses we should in 
every ease admit that which explains the phenomena in the simplest 
possible manner. To his mind the simplest manner of explaining the 
presence of bowlders of primitive rocks scattered over a secondary or 
alluvial region was to suppose that such had been, as. igneous materials, 
extruded through all superincumbent strata, forming peaks which 
have since been destroyed by some convulsion of nature or by the 
resistless tooth of time, the bowlders thus 
being but fragments which had escaped 
destruction, though their place of extrusion 
had become completely obscured. 

Hayden's career was varied and interest- 
ing. Earh T thrown on his own resources, 
with an ardent desire for knowledge and 
craving for travel, he went to sea at the age 
of fourteen, making two voyages to the West 
Indies, after which he re- 
sketch of Hayden. turned to his school and his 
books. When sixteen years 
of age he was bound out to an apprenticeship 
with an architect, with whom he served until 
he reached his majority, when he once more sailed for the West 
Indies and established himself at Point a Pitre in Guadeloupe Island, 
one of the Lesser Antilles. Ill health, however, finally drove him 
back to America, where he found employment in his profession in 
Connecticut and New York, with occasional intervals of teaching, in 
which, it was stated, he was very successful. 

Through accident his attention was turned to dentistry, and with no 
preliminary training and only such knowledge as could be gained by 
reading, he established himself in the practice of that profession in 
Baltimore, somewhere about 182-1, being then, it will be observed, 
between fifty and sixty years of age. In this work he is represented as

being highly successful, rising - rapidly in public confidence and hold- 
ing the highest professional rank in the city. When the American 
Society of Dental Surgeons was established, he became its first presi- 
dent. Aside from his profession he devoted himself to studies in 
physiology and pathology, as well as geology. 

To Volney and Mitchill's hypotheses (mentioned on p. 232) to the 

effect that the deep gorge of the Potomac at Harpers Ferry, of the 

Hudson at West Point, the Delaware near Easton, the Schuylkill 

northwest of Hamburg, and the Susquehanna below 

Wilson's Exceptions l , 

to Hypotheses of Harnsburg, were torn open by the pressure of the 

VWtchill 1821 ■ 

waters of Lake Ontario, Mr. J. W. Wilson, in the 
American Journal of Science for 1821, took exception. He gave 
altitudes showing that the waters of the supposed lake could never 
have risen within 500 feet of the summit of the highlands at West 
Point without discharging over the summits of the mountains at 
Harrisburg; or through Lake Champlain into the Sorel and St. Law- 
rence before rising within 1,400 feet of Butler Hill, near West Point. 
These were good arguments, but the explanations offered by Mr. 
Wilson were in themselves by no means satisfactory. "Is not" he 
wrote "the best theory of the earth, that the Creator, in the begin- 
ning, at least at the general deluge, formed it with all its present 
grand characteristic features ? " To this the editor (Silliman) responded 
in a footnote that "The Creator undoubtedly brought all matter into 
being and established the laws which govern it; the operation of those 
laws then is always a fair subject of discussion, and although it is the 
shortest it is not the most instructive course to out the knot where it 
may be untied" 

Early accounts of the geology and mineralogy of North America 
were eagerly seized upon by foreign scientists, as well as those inter- 
ested from a spirit of gain only. Thus, in 1822 there was published 
in Hamburg, in the form of a small octavo pamphlet of 124 pages, a 
series of extracts from the American Journal of Science and Journal 
of the Academy of Natural Sciences, entitled Beitrage Zur Mineral- 
ogie u. Geologie ' des Nordlichen America's nach/ Amerikanischen 
Zeitschriften bearbeitet von Heinrich von Struve. The articles 
abstracted were Schoolcraft's account of the native copper on the north 
shores of Lake Superior;" A. G. Jessup's geological and mineralogical 
observations on a portion of the northern border of New York;' 
Vanuxem's description and analyses of the Wollastonite (Taffelspath's) 
of Willsborough, New York; 7 ' John Dixon's mineralogical and geo- 
logical observations on a part of North and South Carolina; Gerard 
Troost's description of a mineral resembling amber found in the sands

of Cape Sable;" and miscellaneous notes on the geology and mineral- 
ogy of North America from the same publishers/' There was also 
given a description of a collection of North American minerals. A 
little over four pages were devoted to a description of the marbles of 
Pennsylvania; Connecticut; Vermont; Stockbridge, Massachusetts; 
and Thoraaston, Maine, the descriptions being naturally limited to 
specimens and not to their occurrence in the field.

published in the American -Journal of Science an article of nearly 

forty pages, giving his views on volcanoes and volcanic substances.

exposed to the action of intense heat in the bowels of the earth. The 
seat of the volcano he believed to be below or within the oldest gran-

derived from contact with coal strata, the eruption being usually 
accompanied by electric light, the source of which he acknowledged 
as problematical. Compared with all this 
error, his recognition as lavas of the por- 
phyries in the vicinity of Boston and the 
Triassic traps of the eastern United States 
stands out in remarkable contrast. 

Cooper, or '"Old Coot, 1 ' as he was called

said to have called him. He

ing in books, but rather an 
educator and theorist. He was born in 
London in 1759 and educated at Oxford, 
where he paid chief attention to the classics, though his inclination 
was for the sciences. He came to America in 1795 and settled down 
for a time to the practice of law at Northampton, Pennsylvania. 

A restless, aggressive spirit soon took him into the political field, 
where the violence of his newspaper attacks ca'used him at one time 
to be imprisoned for six months and fined. After his release he was 
appointed first land commissioner and then judge, being removed 
from the latter office for arbitrary conduct. He then turned his 
attention to chemistry and became in turn professor of chemistry in 
Dickinson College in Carlisle, professor of chemistry and mineralogy 
in the Universit}^ of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and professor of

chemistry, mineralogy, natural philosophy, and law (!) in the Univer- 
sity of Virginia. At the last named place he served From 1817 to 
1820, being finally forced to resign on account of the opposition to 
his liberal teachings on the part of the Presbyterians. 

From Charlottesville he went to Columbia, South Carolina, where 
he served as professor of chemistry (1820-21) and then as president 
( Ls^l-1831), being here again compelled to resign for his violent liber- 
alism in matters relating to science and religion. Queerly enough, a 
committee appointed by the State legislature in 1831 to investigate his 
conduct with a view to his removal failed to make out a case, and the 
charges were dismissed. His final undoing would seem to have been 
parallel with that of the sick man whose case his physician was unable 
to diagnose specifically and the record of whose death was put down 
to ''general cussedness." 

Cooper, as above noted, was not a geologist, as the term is now 
used, but comes in for recognition here on account of the prominent 
part he played in early educational movements relating to the intro- 
duction of the science in the universities. It was through his influence 
that the chair of geology at the South Carolina College was established, 
to which Vanuxem was called in 1821, and Le Conte in 1857. At the 
time Cooper assumed the reins in Columbia geology was taught at no 
other institution in America except Yale, and the only available text 
books were the reprints of Bakew r ell's geologies with Silliman's notes. 
To the latter, on account of the acceptation of Mosaic doctrines, Cooper 
took violent exception, and attacked them, lirst in lectures to his 
classes and subsequently in his pamphlet on The Connection between 
Geologjr and the Pentateuch (published in 1833). 

A man of powerful intellect, but a reckless busybody. Bold and 
aggressive, he "walked roughshod over men's opinions and suffered 
the inevitable consequences." His personal appearance must have 
been as peculiar as his conduct. "He was less than 5 feet high and 
his head was the biggest part of the whole man. He was a perfect 
taper from the side of his head down to his feet. He looked like a 
wedge with a head on it," is the way it is expressed by one of his old 
pupils. 

The credulity of even the scientific men of this date (1822) can not 

be better illustrated than by referring to an account by Schoolcraft of 

the finding of supposed human footprints in limestone belonging to 

the ""Secondary" formation (Lower Carboniferous), 

Supposed human "J ■»«■••• -tt o t •

Ihese so-called footprints (see fig. 11) were described 
as those of a man, standing erect, with his heels drawn in and his toes 
turned outward. The distance between the heels \>y accurate measur- 
ment was 6£ inches, and between the toes 13^ inches. Attention was 
called to the fact that the impressions were not those of feet accus-

tomed to a close shoe, the toes being too much spread and the foot 
flattened. The length of the foot was 10i inches, width across the 
spread toes 4 inches, and at the swell of the heels ]>k inches. Public 
attention was first called to these prints by the Rev. Frederick Rapp, 
the head of the religious sect "Hal■monites, ,, who had them removed 
to his village of Harmony, and w T ho, it is said, taught that they were 
the impressions of the feet of the Saviour. 

According to Schoolcraft, every appearance warranted the conclu- 
sion that the impressions were made at a time when the rock was soft

enough to receive them by pressure, and the marks of the feet were 
natural and genuine. In this opinion, he stated, Governor Cass coin- 
cided. He acknowledged, however, there were difficulties in the way 
of accepting this belief, and one of these was the want of tracks lead- 
ing to and from them. He could only account for this on the suppo- 
sition that the toe prints might have pointed inland, "in which case we 
should be at liberty to conjecture that the person making them had 
landed from the Mississippi and proceeded no farther into the interior." 



2()4 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Col. Thomas H. Benton, of Missouri, to whom Schoolcraft wrote 
concerning the footprints, differed with him and regarded them as 
artificial, but his reasons therefor were not sufficient to convince 
Schoolcraft. 

The matter was brought up again by David Dale Owen in 1842 
in an article entitled Regarding Human Footprints in Solid Lime- 
stone, which appeared in the American Journal of Science of that 
date. Owen hen 1 described the appearance of the tracks, and quoted 
the opinions of Maelure, Troost, Say, and Lesueur to the effect that 
they were of artificial origin. The English paleontologist, Mautell, 
was, however, inclined to the opinion of Schoolcraft. Owen himself 
regarded the tracks as artificial for essentially the same reasons as 
those advanced by Benton, to the effect that, first, the footprints were 
not continuous, but isolated; second, this was but a solitary instance 
of human footprints in solid limestone; third, he could not conceive of 
the sudden consolidation of compact limestone after having received, 
while in a plastic state, such impressions; and, last, because of the age, 
nature, and position of the rock, and because no human remains had 
hitherto been discovered in any similar formation. He regarded them 
as having been carved by aborigines with stone implements. In this 
he was doubtless correct. 

Of interest at this time, as bearing upon the subject of faulting and 
displacement, is a paper in the American Journal of Science by D. H. 
Barnes, containing a geological section of the Canaan Mountains in 
Connecticut, together with observations on the soils 
oA r iuitin| ge f822 ns °f tne region. In the explanation of his section, 
beginning at the bottom, the beds are described as 
(L) clay loam with bowlders; (2) transition limestone; (3) white quartz, 
grading on one side into limestone and on the other into clay slate; 
(4) slate; (5) graywacke slate. The strata then repeat themselves in 
the same order, the graywacke slate forming the summit of the knob. 
The entire formation is described as appearing "to have been broken 
off from the primitive tract on the east of it, and to have sunken 
down about one thousand feet perpendicularly.' 1 Regarding the beds 
and their associations on Hancock Mountain, he concluded that the 
strata on the top of the mountains might be considered as origin- 
ally parts of the same bed now at the base of Canaan Mountain, 
whence they had ''been disrupted by some mighty force," 1 the eastern 
part remaining firm, while the western settled down to its present 
position. Referring to Maclure's map, he found that the two forma- 
tions discussed "butt against each other in a line nearly straight for 
more than 300 miles." This he accounted for by supposing "that 
some mighty convulsion has rent asunder the continent from the St. 
Lawrence to the ocean, 11 though what this force may have been he

left for others to decide. He, however, thought it probable that it 
operated from beneath, "and that, after it had opened for itself a 
vent, and escaped through the rift caused by its action, the rock 
strata of the western part fell into the cavity which had previously 
contained the imprisoned agent." 

In 1S23 Dr. John J. Bigsby, a surgeon of the British army sta- 
tioned in Canada, read before the Geological Society of London a 
paper, subsequently published in their transactions, on the Geology 
and Geography of Lake Huron. He noted that the 
canada' s i^2°3 rk '" rocks of the north shore of the lake were mainly primi- 
tive -granite, gneiss, basanite — quartz rock, conglom- 
erate, and greenstone. The other shores were described as occupied 
by secondary rocks, frequently fossiliferous, which he regarded as 
forming part of an immense basin, which, "extending probably 
without interruption from the southern shore of Lake Winnipeg, 
spreads itself over the greater part of lakes Superior, Huron, and 
Simcoe, the whole of lakes Michigan, Erie, and Ontario, much of the 
western part of the State of New York, the whole of the States of 
Ohio, Illinois. Indiana, and Michigan, and the rest of the valley of the 
Mississippi." On Thessalon Island was found a new species of Orth<>- 
ceratite, which, though described and figured, was not named. Drum- 
mond Island yielded also corals and a trilobite — Asaphus platycephalus. 
Naturally no attempt was made to determine the relative age of the 
rocks by means of these fossils. 

In the year following. Doctor Bigsby had an article, in the Annals 
of the Lyceum of Natural History (New York) on the geology of 
Montreal. He described the lowest rock of the region as a trap of a 
kind unique in the Canadas, and illustrating "in a 
ffMont reaS he i8 e 24 0gy beautiful manner the affinity existing between the 
formation of which it is a member and the primitive 
class in general." 

A horizontal shell limestone of a bluish-black color he noted as 
forming the floor of the plain surrounding the hill on which the city 
stands, and through this hill, as a center, the passage in all directions 
of a large number of trap dikes. 

The sandstone of St. Ann's he rightly described as underlying the 
limestone, and noted the presence of fossil Li/ngulse,, Terebratulse, 
Trilobites, and Orthoceratites. 

In the consideration of the sands and gravels constituting the so- 
called alluvial, he followed the trend of opinion of his time, regarding 
them as products of the vast inland seas which succeeded the deluge. 

The coastal plain of the Eastern United States, which up to this 
time had been studied in detail only by Maclure and II. H. Hayden, 
was in 1823 made the subject of a special essay by John Finch, then 



266 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

professor of geology and mineralogy in Birmingham, England. This 
appears to have been the first attempt at a subdi- 

Finch's Subdivision . . . *- . 

of the Tertiary, vision ot the tertiary deposits and their scientific 
correlation, and was, beyond question, the most impor- 
tant contribution to the stratigraphy of the region that had thus far 
appeared. 

From an examination of all available data, as well as from a per- 
sonal inspection of a part of the area, Finch was led to conclude that 
this formation, as existing in America, was identical and contempora- 
neous with the newer Secondary and Tertiary formations of Europe 
and other countries. 

In this same year Finch gave also a short sketch of the geolog} 7 of 
the country near Easton, Pennsylvania, his paper being accompanied 
by a small colored map and catalogue of minerals. According to 
J. P. Lesley, this was the first paper on the geology of Pennsylvania 
to appear in the pages of the American Journal of Science. 

The paper on the coastal plain, above noted, is b}^ all means the 
most important of Finch's geological publications, though in the 
American Journal of Science for 1826 he had a brief "Memoir' 1 
(3i pages) on the red-brown sandstones of the Connecticut Valley and 
New Jersey, where he expressed the opinion that such should be con- 
sidered as belonging to the new-red or variegated sandstones of Europe 
rather than to the old-red, as contended by some. In this he was right. 

In 1823, too, Denison Olmsted, "a Connecticut school-teacher/ 1 

was authorized by the president of the State board of agriculture of 

North Carolina to make a geological survey of the State. This act is 

sometimes referred to with sectional pride as being 

Olmsted's Work in _ , , _, 

North Carolina, the first survev undertaken under State auspices." 

1823 

Olmsted's first report, a pamphlet of 41 pages, 
appeared under date of 1821 and was mainly of an economic character, 
dealing only with the distribution in the State of such substances as 
graphite, gold, coal, and building stones. 

His second report appeared in 1827, but bore on the title-page the 
date 1825. He naturally dwelt upon the agricultural possibilities of 
the country and the suitability of its limestones and marls for ferti- 
lizing purposes. Some space was devoted to the great slate formation '' 

"The work of Eaton in New York in 1824 was the first sufficiently thorough and 
systematic survey to be dignified as a geological survey, though as this was done 
under the patronage of Hon. Stephen Van Rensselaer, it can. not be considered a 
public survey. To Massachusetts credit must be given for the first geological survey 
made at the expense of the State, the same being begun under the direction of Rev. 
Edward Hitchcock in 1830. (See p. 307. )

and its included rocks and minerals. He noted that the "whole sec- 
tion of country from the great slate formation to the Blue Ridge" is 
granitic, containing numerous subordinate formations, such as mica- 
slate and greenstone, with beds of iron ore, etc., and described with 
some detail the Natural Wall of Rowan, which was supposed by early 
observers (see p. 255) to be the work of human hands, but which he 
rightly ascribed to the natural jointing and decomposition of a basic 
igneous rock. The "peculiar assemblage of rocks that cross the Dan 
River at Buckingham' 1 he classed as transition. 

In his kt conclusion " he remarked that " the rocks are not, as in most 
other countries, particularly New England, exposed on the surface, but 
are very generally concealed b} r a thick covering of clay and sand." 
This he rightly regarded as having resulted from the decomposition of 
the rocks themselves, and not due to a deluge of waters, "as might 
at first be thought/ 1

informed by his biographer, always regarded it as his more appro-

vate science as to teach and

Yale in 1813, and for a time 
employed as tutor there, he in 1817 was 
appointed to the chair of chemistry in the 
University of North Carolina. While here 
he conceived the idea of a State geological 
and mineralogical survey and laid the plan 
before the board of internal improvements 
in 1821, with the oner to himself perform 
the entire work gratuitously, asking only 
an appropriation of $100 (to be afterwards 
renewed or not at the pleasure of the board), 
to defray his necessary expenses in traveling. 
This proposition was, however, declined," only to be renewed a year 
or two later, with the result that in 1823 the assembly authorized the 
board of agriculture to have such a survey made and appropriated the 
sum of $250 a y ear, for a period of four }^ears, to cany it out. The 

a Referring to this failure to secure assistance, Olmsted, under date of January 9, 
1822, wrote to a friend: "But the Legislature (the Senate, I mean) has, it seems, 
saved me any trouble on their account. I, however, feel most highly gratified and 
greatly encouraged at the handsome manner in which my proposition was treated by 
the Board of Improvement; and the readiness with which the resolution was adopted 
by the Commons inspires the hope that something may yet be accomplished at the 
public expense. But my feelings are too much interested in this project to yield to 
this failure; I hope to do something by my own exertions next summer, and trust 
the hospitality of the people of the State will make amends for my poverty. If I 
can live (as I think I can) on the charity of the people, I don't know what need I 
shall have of the public money; for Mr. M says he will lend me a horse."

work tints inaugurated was interrupted in L825 by his call to the 
professorship of mathematics and natural philosophy in Yale College, 
hut was taken up again almost immediately by Dr. Elisha Mitchell 
and, continued for two years longer (see p. 285). 

The mental breadth of Olmsted is shown in the fact that while occu- 
pying this position at Yale he prepared in 1831 a two-volume work on 
natural philosophy, a text-book on astronomy in 1839, and became 
well known throughout the scientific world through his papers on 
meteoric showers and the zodiacal light. 

Of his personal character it is written: 

His uniform kindness and courtesy of demeanor and patience in imparting instruc- 
tion, the excellent moral influence which he always exerted, as well by his consistent 
Christian example as by his personal counsels, the genuine friendliness of his disposi- 
tion, and the unaffected interest which he always manifested in the welfare of his 
pupils — especially the readiness and fidelity with which he encouraged and assisted 
any who exhibited special fondness for the studies of his department — will not soon 
lie forgotten by those who enjoyed the benefit of his instructions, and especially by 
those who were admitted to his closer friendship. 

In this same 3'ear Edward Hitchcock published in the American 

Journal of Science a sketch of the geology, mineralogy, and scenery 

of the regions contiguous to the Connecticut River, the same being 

accompanied by a colored geological map embracing 

Hitchcock's Geology l ' i i -i • i 

of the Region an area some 30 miles broad bv 150 miles in length. 

Contiguous to the . . . . 

Connecticut River, the coloring and classification of the rocks were not 

1 823 

strictly Wernerian, as might have been expected, but 
an attempt was made " to give every particular rock that position and 
extent on the map which it actually occupies on the earth's surface." 
The paper was devoted mainly to a discussion of the lithological nature 
and geographic distribution of the various rocks, which were classed 
as granite, gneiss, hornblende slate, mica slate, talcose slate, chlorite, 
syenite, primitive green slate, argillite, limestone, verd-antique, old- 
red sandstone, secondary greenstone, coal formation, and alluvion. 
Incidentally he discussed their possible origin and relationship. 

The granite he described as occurring in beds, and regarded it as 
primitive, along with the gneiss, mica slate, and the greenstone to 
the west of New Haven, while that to the north and east was thought 
to be secondary. The argillite was also regarded as primitive, on the 
ground of its being highly inclined and destitute of organic remains. 
The red-brown sandstone now known to be of Triassic age he con- 
sidered as the old-red sandstone of Werner and Cleaveland, but dis- 
cussed the possibility of a part of it, as at Chatham and Middletown, 
belonging to the coal formation. 

He chronicled the rinding in this sandstone at Deerfield of petrifac- 
tions belonging to the genus phytolite and to the species lignite, and 
agreeing with the petrifactions found in theCatskill red sandstones by 
Eaton and referred to "the tribe of Naked Vermes." Fossil bones of

an animal .some 5 feet in length were also mentioned as having been 
found in this sandstone at East Windsor." 

The year following Prof. Chester Dewey came forward with a paper 
in the same journal. A Sketch of the Geology and the Mineralogy 
of the Western Part of Massachusetts. This was likewise aceom- 
Deweyonthe panied by a hand-colored geological map designed as :i 

M e ^sfchu f srttI Stern continuation of Hitchcock's and carrying the field of 
1824, observation as far west as the Hudson River. 

Working from the Hudson River eastward, he found a belt of transi- 
tion argillite succeeded by a broad belt of graywacke with included 
areas of the argillite; this followed by another continuous belt of the 
same, and then one of transition limestone and a narrow one of primi- 
tive argillaceous slate directly along the border line of New York and 
Massachusetts. Beyond this, in Massachusetts, a broad belt of prim- 
itive limestone with included areas of mica slate, quartz rock, and 
transition shell and compact limestone, which still farther to the east 
became the predominant rock, with a narrow area of gneiss, a small 
one of granite, and one of talcose slate. 

The most pretentious piece of field work accomplished by Amos 

Baton was that done under the direction of the Hon. Stephen Van 

Rensselaer in 1N^4, and comprised a geological and agricultural survey 

of the district adjoining the Erie Canal. The results 

Eaton's Survey of . .. . . 

the Erie Canal, of this survey were published in a quarto volume of 

163 pages, which was accompanied by a geological sec- 
tion extending from Albany to Lake Erie, and one b} r Edward Hitch- 
cock from Boston to Plainfield, the two combined enabling Eaton to 
give a continuous section all the way from Lake Erie to the Atlantic 
Ocean at Boston Harbor. 

To judge from the introductory remarks in this report. Eaton had 
been accused of a disposition to create new names. He. therefore, 
here announced that he had made use of European names, so far as 
possible, but had found at least five distinct and continuous strata, 
none of which could, with any propriety, take a name given in any 
European treatise which had thus far reached this country. 

He found along the line of the canal rocks belonging to the prim- 
itive, transition, and secondary series. AH these were described in 
considerable detail, but almost wholly with reference to their litho- 
logical features. When fossils occurred, such were noted, but were 
not utilized as aids to correlation. 

The prevalent ideas on chemical geology are well brought out in 
certain parts of his discussion. He recognized the fact that many of 
the valleys were excavated in the softer and more soluble rocks, like 

"These bones were at first thought to be possibly human, but the finding of evi- 
dences of a tail at least 5 feet in length caused the abandonment of this idea! ( Amer- 
ican Journal of Science, III, 1821, p. 247.) 



270 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

limestone, and that carbonic- acid holds its base (the lime) with a tenure 
more feeble than that of the common acids; consequently he argued 
that when muriatic, sulphuric, or nitric acid comes in contact with 
limestone, it is immediately decomposed. 

We have vast quantities of muriate of lime in our wells, springs, etc., which is a 
very soluble salt. If nature has now, or formerly had, any method for present- 
ing large quantities of muriatic acid to the lime rocks, they would of course be 
reduced to that soluble salt with great rapidity. Lime rocks would lie rapidly dis- 
solved, leaving valleys between those rocks which are subject to the ordinary disin- 
tegrating agents only. The valleys of Adams, Williamstown, Little Hoosick, etc., 
which are situated on limestone, could then be satisfactorily explained. If the com- 
mon opinion that the ocean has stood over our continent be received as true, we 
have only to add one more conjecture to make out the requisite supply of muriatic 
acid; that is, we must suppose that the ocean at that time contained an excess of 
that acid. 

In spite of admonitions by Van Rensselaer, Eaton insisted in indulg- 
ing in a theorizing propensity, although he would not acknowledge it 
by this name, claiming that he but traced ""a few of nature's footsteps 
where the impressions still remain entire." Finding large and small 
masses of what he designated as calciferous sandstone, metalliferous 
limestone, and graywacke, which properly overlie the slate, actually, 
as he thought, embedded in it, where the rocks were exposed, as at 
Cohoes Falls, he would argue that these masses fell in between the 
slate lamina 1 while the latter were in a semi-indurated state. 

Eaton noted the probable difference in age between the red sand- 
stones of the Connecticut Valley and of the Catskill Mountains, which 
latter he rightly considered to belong to the old-red or Devonian forma- 
tions. In discussing the Saliferous rock occurring near Little Falls 
and extending to the west end of Lake Ontario in upper Canada, and its 
economic importance, he was disposed to argue that the brine springs 
issuing from the same were what he called "the daily productions of 
nature's laboratory." "We see, 11 he wrote, "the sulphur in iron 
pyrites taking oxygen from water, and thereby becoming sulphuric 
acid; we then see it uniting with magnesia, which is diffused in rocks, 
and thus forming Epsom salts. * * * We are all familiar, too, 
with the process of nature by which alum and copperas are made. 
Why ma} T we not suppose that the two constituents of common salt 
(muriatic acid and soda) are in some state of combination in the rocks 
of the salt district, and that by some of those double decompositions 
with which nature is perfectly familiar salt is produced in the liquid 
state? May not this be the cause of the superior saltness of the brine 
springs of Salina over those foreign springs which are supposed to 
proceed from the solution of rock salt?" 

It was in this work that Eaton introduced the name "Calciferous 
slate" to designate the slaty rock associated with gwpsum and shell

limestone occurring- as the principal rock forming the ridge south of 
the land from Oneida Creek to Pittsford." 

The naturalist liafinesque, as might have been expected, did not 
hesitate to express himself on subjects geological, his ideas, however, 
being a strange admixture of Wernerism and groundless imagery. 
We will note here only his Annals of Kentucky, which 
views of RaHnesque, a p peare d i n Humphry's history of that State, pub- 
lished in 1824, where, as Doctor Peters has succinctly 
remarked, "In only 26 duodecimo pages he gives the geological, eth- 
nological, and historical annals of Kentucky from the first day of 
creation, according to Moses, down to the current year.'" 

The geological history of the State he divided into six periods, the 
first being that of a general inundation, in which the "briny ocean 
covers the whole land of Kentucky and the United States, rising above 
4,000 feet over the Cumberland or Sawioto Mountains and 5,000 feet 
over the limestone region near Lexington." The Organ and Mexican 
mountains alone in all North America rose above the water level. 

Through a gradual decrease of the ocean and the decomposition and 
consolidation of its waters the various rock strata were deposited in 
the following order: (1) Limestone; (2) slate; (3) sandstone; (4) free- 
stone; (5) grit; (6) pebblestone. These, he stated, were not always 
superincumbent or coexistent, though generally horizontal except the 
last four toward the Cumberland Mountains, which; having probably 
a granitic nucleus, have compelled the incumbent strata to become 
1,4 obliqual " or inclined from ten to thirty degrees. (In this, it will 
be noted, he showed an inability, characteristic in his day, to com- 

"The following reference to this survey appeared in the American Journal of 
Science, IX, 1825, and will serve to show how Eaton's work was regarded by his 
contemporaries. The note, it should be stated, was signed C. D. (presumably 
Chester Dewey) : 

"Mr. Jeffrey, the principal conductor of the Edinburgh Review, has obtained the 
opinion of Professor Buckland, the celebrated author of the Reliquiae DUuvianse 
(published in 1823), on the above work of Professor Eaton. In a letter to the Hon. 
S. Van Rensselaer Mr. Jeffrey has given the result. Mr. Buckland says that the 
'author seems both to understand his subject and to have done his work carefully.' 
The work contains, indeed, abundant evidence of extensive and patient examination. 
This point will not he affected by the adoption or rejection of Mr. Eaton's peculiar 
views by our geologists. In some parts there is an evident improvement upon some 
of his previous publications on the geology of our country. Thus, at page 31 and 
page 62 and onward we find introduced 'primitive argillite,' a rock so clearly sepa- 
rated and so easily distinguished in our country from 'transition argillite,' though 
both are united under the same name by Bakewell and some others. 

"Mr. Buckland makes some objection to the style, and complains of Mr. Eaton for

prehend the effect of subsequent uplift in tilting- rock strata.) By 
the operation of submarine volcanoes during- this period the strata of 
coal, clay, and amygdaloid were formed and intermixed at various 
intermittent times with the other strata. 

During the second period the Cumberland Mountains emerged from 
the sea, the waters of which sank to a level of 1,500 feet above those 
of to-day. The formation of the schistose rocks proceeded, vegetation 
began, and streams began to flow. 

During the third period the level of the water was reduced to 1,100 
feet and all the table-lands and highlands of Kentucky became uncov- 
ered. An inland sea still covered the Ohio limestone basin, extending 
from the actual mouth of Sciota River to that of Salt River. Land 
animals, inseets, reptiles, birds, and quadrupeds were created during 
this period. 

During the fourth period the level of the sea was reduced to 700 
feet, and the limestone sea of Kentucky drained. Alluviums and 
bottoms began to form in the valleys and gulfs by the attrition of the 
strata and soil conveyed and deposited by the streams. Sinks and 
caves in the limestone region were formed. Lastly, Adam appeared 
in the Garden of Eden. This fourth period of Kentucky history 
thereby answered to the sixth day of the general creation. 

The fifth period was that of Noah's flood, though Ratinesque 
acknowledged he failed to find an} r traces of such a violent convulsion 
in Kentucky. The ocean, which still bathed its western corner, sub- 
sided to about 300 feet above its present level and abandoned Ken- 

and the continuity of the description is much interrupted. We do not object to this 
in that part of the work entitled 'General Descriptions of North American Rocks,' 
though some have said that these can hardly belong, in a general view, to the dis- 
trict of the canal. But in the ' Description of rocks in the vicinity of the Erie 
Canal,' page 47, the fault often occurs. We mention the account of the hornblende 
rocks near West Point, page 54; of granular quartz, pages 56, 57; of granular lime- 
stone, pages 57, 58, and many others which are not found near the line of the canal. 
" If the work should pass to a second edition, which is highly probable, and even 
rendered somewhat necessary to make it as complete as the subsequent examinations 
of Professor Eaton enable him to do, and as the light thrown on the subject of the 
newer formations by the very able work of Conybeare and Phillips on the Geology 
of England and Wales seems to require, we would suggest as an improvement of the 
work that the notices of rocks which are not found along the line of the canal be 
omitted in this part of the work, or be reduced to the bare remark that they do not 
occur in the district, and that the remarks and localities of rocks in other parts of 
the country be taken from the text and put into form of notes. In this way the 
continuity of geological description of the country along the canal will be unbroken. 
We think no one can read the work without being sensible of its interest and 
importance to every one who examines the rocks of this district. The localities are 
given with much precision, and the traveler is enabled at once to ascertain the 
rocks intended by the names which Professor E. has given them. It were to be 
wished that the common nomenclature of the rocks had been altered with a more 
sparing hand."

tuck}' forever. Strata began to consolidate, ponds and marshes 
decreased, animals multiplied, and vegetation overspread the soil. 

The sixth period, that of Peleg's flood, was one of catastrophe. 
Great volcanic eruptions in Europe and America, with awful earth- 
quakes convulsed the Atlantic Ocean. During this period the Atlantic 
land disappeared leaving only the volcanic islands — Azores, Madeira, 
Canary, and Cape Verde — to mark its position. 

It will be remembered that in 1793 Benjamin De Witt noted the 

great diversity among the bowlders along the shore of Lake Ontario 

and recognized the fact that such must have been conveyed there b} T 

some extraordinary means. The means conceived of 

Dobson's Obser- T . - , ,. , , . 

vation on the b} r De Witt were indeed extraordinary and nothing 

less than a ''mighty convulsion of nature." Peter 
Dobson, a Connecticut cotton manufacturer, writing thirty-two years 
later, showed himself a better observer and more gifted in powers of 
deduction. 

In a letter to Benjamin Silliman, dated November 21, 1825," Dobson 
described bowlders which were unearthed at Vernon, Connecticut, 
while excavating preliminary to the erection of a cotton factory, as 
"worn smooth on their under side as if done by their having been 
dragged over rocks and gravel ly earth in one stead y position.' 1 They 
also showed scratches and furrows on the abraded, parts. He could 
account for these appearances only by calling in the aid of ice along 
with water, the blocks having been worn by being suspended and 
carried in ice over rocks and earth under water. 

These observations seem to have attracted no attention at the time, 
and even Edward Hitchcock, thirteen years later, attached no serious 
importance to them, although his attention was called to the matter by 
another letter from Dobson, this time addressed to Hitchcock himself. 
In this second letter, written in 1838, Dobson described the bowlders as 
having been first rounded by attrition and then worn flat on one side 
by a motion that kept them in one relative position, as a plane slides 
over a board in the act of planing. Some of them he describes as 
worn and scratched so plainly that there was no difficulty in pointing 
out which side was foremost in the act of wearing, a projecting bit of 
quartz or feldspar protecting the softer material behind it. In this 
letter he again announced his inability to account for these appearances 
except on the supposition that the boulders had been enveloped in ice 
and moved forward over the sea bottom by currents of water. The 
drifting icebergs off the Labrador coast he thought might well 
illustrate the conditions and methods of their production. 

Perhaps it may have been because Dobson was a cotton manufac- 
turer and not a member of the learned profession, or there may have

been other reasons for it, but Hitchcock allowed the observations to 
pass unnoticed until 1842 when the subject was brought up by 
no less an authority than Murchison, in his anniversary address before 
the Geological Society of London. "I take leave of the glacial 
theory, 1 ' said Murchison, "'in congratulating American science in 
having possessed the original author of the best glacial theory, though 
his name has escaped notice, and in recommending to you the terse 
argument of Peter Dobson, a previous acquaintance with which might 
have saved volumes of disputation on both sides of the Atlantic.' 1 " 
Supported by this somewhat enthusiastic indorsement, Hitchcock then 
gave the letter to the public through the American Journal of Science, 6 
though at the same time remarking that he had himself derived his 
ideas concerning the joint action of ice and water from the writings 
of Sir James Hall. 

April 25, 1823, Maj. S. H. Long received orders from the* War 
Department to make an expedition for a general survey of the coun- 
try in the vicinity of the Great Lakes and the sources of the Missis- 
sippi: to prepare a topographic description of the 

The Longdating ll ' l r ,,,,., j , , ., . , ,, 

Expedition, same; to ascertain the latitude and longitude ot all 

1821=1825 

the remarkable points; to investigate its productions, 
animal, vegetable, and mineral, and to inquire into the characteristics 
and customs of the Indians. The route of the expedition (see map, 
tig. 16) beginning at Philadelphia, was through Wheeling, West Vir- 
ginia, to Chicago by way of Fort Wayne; thence to Fort Crawford and 
up the Mississippi to Fort St. Anthon3 T , and the source of the St. 
Peters River; thence to the point of intersection between Red River 
and the forty-ninth degree of north latitude; along the northern bound- 
ary of the United States to Lake Superior, and thence homeward by 
the Great Lakes. 

Although not intended primarily as a scientific survey, it was accom- 
panied by Thomas Say, zoologist, and William II. Keating, mineralo- 
gist. It was expected that Dr. Edwin .lames, who with Say had been 
a member of the expedition of 1819-20, would be a member of this 
also, but through failure to connect with the party at Wheeling or 
Columbus the expedition was deprived of his services. 

An account of this survey, under the title of Narrative of an 
Expedition to the Sources of St. Peters River, etc., was prepared by 
William H. Keating and published in two volumes in London in 1825. 
Keating, it should be noted, was professor of mineralogy and chemis- 
try as applied to the arts in the University of Pennsylvania, and 
though his published notes contain little or nothing along the broad 
lines of geology, they are full of references which, at the time they 
were written, were of value.

River. The occurrence of a white marble near Hagerstown and a 
secondary blue limestone in the vicinity of Cumberland was noted, and 
some attention given to the coal formations in the vicinity of Cumber- 
land and Wheeling-. He noted further the occurrence of a limestone 
containing organic remains lying in a nearl} T horizontal position in the 
vicinity of Chicago, but no superposition being visible, he was unable 
to determine its relative age. 

Concerning the lead ores at Dubuque, and their apparent occur- 
rence only in the alluvial soil, he wrote: 

From the specimens which we have seen, * * * we can not hesitate in assert- 
ing it as our opinion that no lead has yet been discovered on the Merrimeg or Miss- 
issippi in metalliferous limestones, but that wherever it has been found it has always 
been in an alluvium and never in regular veins or beds, nor even in masses which 
might be considered as coeval with the substances in which they are embedded. 

The Cambrian sandstone found between the Wassemon and the Wis- 
consin rivers he regarded as not older than the variegated or Banter 
sandstein of Werner (Triassic), and the Lower Silurian limestone which 
lies above the sandstone, as corresponding to the English Lias. The 
whole region comprising the headwaters of the Winnipeek River was 
looked upon as having been at a comparatively recent period an 
immense lake interspersed with innumerable barren, rocky islands, 
which had been drained by the bursting of the barriers which tided 
back the waters. The innumerable bowlders which he found covering 
the valley were regarded, as were similar bowlders in other places by 
his contemporaries, as due to the flood of waters caused by the bursting 
of these natural dams. 

This was plainly a recognition of the extinct glacial Lake Agassiz, 
later described by Lieut. G. K. Warren/' and the history of which was 
worked out in detail by Warren Uphani. 

Keating's ideas as to the possible development of the mining industry 
were not of the most advanced type. Referring to the subject of the 
supposed source of the native copper reported by Schoolcraft (p. 244), 
he wrote: 

The question which appears to us of far greater importance is not where the copper 
lies, but what shall we do with it if it should be found. We are very doubtful 
whether any other advantage would result from it, at least for a century to come, 
than the mere addition in books of science of a new locality of this metal. 

This in 1825! The development of the Michigan copper mines 
began about 1855, and up to 1889 the combined mines had produced 
over 1,000,000,000 pounds of the refined metal. The output for 1889 
alone amounted to 87,455,675 pounds.

This is of interest, since while the nafure of the fold was partially 

realized, the means by which it was brought about was 
Overturned Folds, considered as problematical. Similar phenomena had 

been noted by Eaton (p. 253) and by Maclure, but with 
nothing like as much detail. The writer says: 

It is impossible to examine this locality without being strongly impressed with the 
belief that the position which the strata here assume could not have been effected 
in any other way than by a power operating from beneath upward and at the same 
time possessing a progressive force, something analogous to what takes place in the 
breaking up of the ice of large rivers.

considered in connection with 

the dispute relating- to priority of discovery which later arose between 
Messrs. Hitchcock and Rogers. (See p. 31l.)

suggested or, indeed, attempted. In that year, however, Maclure, in

278 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

The appearance in hook form of Prof. Jeremiah Van Rensselaer's 

lectures on geology, as delivered before the New York Athenaeum in 

L825, gives us an opportunity of judging of the condition of science 

at that date, such as was ottered a few years earlier bv 

Van Rensselaer's 

Lectures on Geology, Alitchill s Observations. 

1825. T7 t» i i ..... 

Van Rensselaer was not so much an original investi 
gator as a student and teacher; hence the inference 1 is fair that his 
work gives us a summary of existing knowledge rather than the details 
of his own observations or his individual views. He reviewed the 
opinions of the cosmogonists and theorists from Burnett, in 1680, 
down to Werner and Mutton, and referred to the work of his prede- 
cessors and contemporaries in America, summing up with conclu- 
sions condensed from Cuvier's Observations, to the effect that, first, 
the sea had, at one period or other, not only covered all our plains, but 
remained there 1 for a long time in a state of tranquillity; second, that 
there had been at least one change in the basin of the sea which pre- 
ceded the present one; third, that the particular portions of the earth 
which the sea had abandoned by its last retreat had been laid dry once 
before and had at that time produced quadrupeds, birds, plants, and 
all kinds of terrestrial productions; and that it had been reinundated by 
the sea, which had since retired and left it to the possession of its own 
proper inhabitants. These facts, which had been proven through 
geological evidence, he regarded as supporting the accounts of Moses, 
both agreeing, first, in the prevalence ever everything else of water 
at the time of the creation; second, in the subsequent separation of 
the land from the water; and, third, in the eruption of the sea over the 
continent, the last corresponding to the Noachian deluge. 

Van Rensselaer recognized the value of fossils in proving the iden- 
tit} T of geological horizons, also the fact that organic remains have 
been deposited in successive generations and in such order that those 
of one bed bear a certain connection to each other and exhibit certain 
distinctive points differentiating them from those of earlier or later 
deposits, and that the greater the distance between the deposits the 
greater the difference between the contained fossils. This, 1 believe, 
is the second recognition by an American author of a now well-estab- 
lished principle. 

The tendency to make sweeping generalizations founded upon purely 
local observations is noticeable in his writings, as in those of many of 
his contemporaries. Thus, in describing the gneiss: 

It is the next rock to granite and occurs resting or lying upon it. When they are 
both seen in the same mountain its ledge is always the lower of the two. Mountains 
of gneiss are seldom so steep as those of granite, and the summits are not quite so 
peaked. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY EATONIAN ERA, 1820-1829. 279 

Or, again, in writing on the weathering of rocks: 

The decomposition of granite is slow and when decomposed the unfriendly siliceous 
grains are .easily washed away. There is neither vegetable nor animal matter in the 
compound; it does not absorb moisture, letting the moisture percolate, nor does it 

retain heat. The soil made from gneiss is not washed away so easily, and the mica 
yields more argillaceous matter. * * Micaceous schist and argillite decompose 

more rapidly and form a better, though not a good, soil. * The rivers of 

primary districts have rocky beds and precipitous hanks, etc. 

Van Rensselaer was one of the first to recognize the necessity of 
exercising cure in the selection of stones for building purposes: 

We take our materials because they are near at hand, because they are cheap, and 
hecar.se others have taken the same, in preference to searching out others which 
* * * are more durable. Scarcely any one building in Europe or America of 
modern construction at the end of one thousand years will have one stone left upon 
another stone to denote the place where it stood, and the most splendid works of 
modern architecture are even now hastening to decay from want of attention to this 
subject. 

His remarks on anthracite coal offer an interesting illustration of a 
disposition, still too frequently met with, to make the observed facts 
conform to preconceived opinions. Anthracite or native mineral car- 
bon, or "" blind coal." he wrote, is not regarded, strictly speaking, as a 
coal, though combustible. 

It occurs in the primary rocks, and hence it is obvious that it did not proceed from 
the decomposition of vegetable substances, since it is generally acknowledged that 
the primary rocks were formed previous to the existence of vegetation. 

An analytical key or a synopsis, given with a view of facilitating 
the study of geology, is of particular interest, since the methods of 
modern petrography have shown how absolutely impossible it is to 
classify rocks by a simple examination of the hand specimen and with- 
out the aid of a microscope. It is difficult to imagine a student in 
other than a thorough state of mental demoralization who should 
attempt to identify and classify rocks from such a description, an 
abstract of which is given below: 

SYNOPSIS OF THE OVERLYINU OR SUPERINCUMBENT ROCKS. 

FIRST DIVISION. 
Simple, or apparently so. 

A. Wacke, of the German school. Resembles indurated clay, with an even and 
smooth earthy, or an uneven, somewhat granular fracture, and a shining streak. 

a. Compact. 

b. Cellular; but generally in that case partly amygdaloidal and appertaining to 
another division. 

B. Indurated clay, more or less hard, with an earthy and dull fracture. 
a. Compact. 

This is different from the ferruginous clays found often with the trap rocks, which 
pass into jasper. 
h. Cellular. 



280 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Like var. A, b, it is rarely cellular in large masses without also containing amyg- 
daloidal nodules, when it passes to another division. The colors of this variety are 
usually ash or gray of different hues, or modifications of red, or brown, or purplish 
blarck. 

The prevalent ideas on the subject of earthquakes at this time may 
be gleaned from a paper by Dr. Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia, in the 
American Journal of Science for 1825. Lea rejected the theories put 
forward in 1749 by a Doctor Stukley to the effect that 
Earthquakes, 1825. earthquakes were caused by lightning, but regarded 
them as the effect of volcanic eruptions, though at the 
same time he could see no necessary connection between the electric 
discharges of volcanoes and the earthquakes, regarding such as an 
effect rather than a cause. 

He thought that there were strong reasons for believing a consider- 
able portion of the interior of the earth to be in a constant state of 
incandescence and that there were beneath the surface great cavities 
or channels of connection between one volcano and another. "We 
must admit," he wrote, "of deep-seated channels of connection 
stretching from one portion of the globe to the others, through which 
the explosive gases pass with an instantaneous motion, accompanied 
by a rumbling or terrible noise peculiar to earthquakes/ 1 In this, it 
will be noted, he followed to a large extent the teachings of Humboldt 
and Newton. These channels, he thought, had connection with the 
sea, basing his opinion upon the fact that volcanoes throw up salt 
water and fish; moreover, that most volcanoes are situated near the 
sea. He regarded these branching channels as species of horizontal 
volcanoes, their roofs and walls furnishing material which, aided by 
oxygen supplied by the influx of the sea, would yield the necessary 
amount of combustible matter to keep up the earth's internal fire. 
To the possible objection that rocks in themselves would not burn, he 
answered that, when such are decomposed, "their metallic bases, cal- 
cium, silicium, aluminum, magnesium, etc., are highly incandescent." 

Four years later (1829) Maclure, in discussing the theories of Poulett 

Scrope, took exception to the views of Lea, though he failed to offer 

anything satisfactory in return. He instanced the earthquake of 

1811-12 in the Mississippi Valley, in which only the 

Maclure's Criticisms . i i -f tii i • 

of scrope and Lea, alluvial formations had been disturbed, and questioned 

1829 

if such could not have been caused by the evolution of 
elastic gases arising from the fermentation of large masses of vegetable 
matter accumulated in the beds. If such were the case, however, he 
recognized the possibility of an increase in the frequency of earth- 
quakes as fermentation went on. Maclure evidently did not place a 
great amount of reliance on his own theories, for he states, in referring 
to some of the ideas advanced by Scrope: a "All these speculations are 

a Scrope' a Theory of Volcanoes appeared in 1825.

out of the reach of our senses and can be accounted only as amuse-

In 1820 there appeared a Manual of Mineralogy and Geology, 

designed for the use of schools and for persons attending lectures on 

these subjects, as also a convenient pocket companion for travelers in 

the United States of America, the same being from

Geology, 1826. * . -a • l • l U- 

act a very important part in American geological his- 
tory, but at that time newly graduated from the Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute at Troy, New York. 

Emmons at first studied, and later practiced, medicine, but in 1828 
removed to Williamstown, where he had been appointed lecturer on 
chemistry. During the years 1830-1837 he also served as junior pro- 
fessor in the Rensselaer Institute, and in 1836 was appointed one of 
the four geologists of the New York State survey. In 1812 he became 
custodian of the State collections at Albany, and in 1843 engaged in 
investigations relating to the agricultural resources of the State, the 
results of which were published during the period'1846-1854. in the form 
of five quarto volumes. In 1851 he was appointed State geologist of 
North Carolina, a position which he retained until the time of his death. 

As noted elsewhere, Emmons, during his work on the New York 
State survey, became involved in a discussion relative to the so-called 
"'Taconic System, 1 ' which lasted for nearly half a century and which 
undoubtedly seriously embittered the latter days of his life. The dis- 
pute, indeed, became at times so harsh that Emmons was practically 
ostracized by the scientific fraternity. 

In 1851 he published a pretentious volume on North American geol- 
ogy, and, in connection with his work in North Carolina, two volumes 
on the agriculture and geology of the State. He died during the period 
of the civil war, and his papers and notes are said to have become 
lost in the unsettled condition of the country which followed. 

It is impossible here to go into a discussion of the true merits of the 
Taconic controversy, and the matter is reserved for a separate chap- 
ter. Hundreds of pages of printed matter have been published, cov- 
ering a period of nearly fifty years, but the name has now disappeared 
from the maps and is only of historical interest. 

Emmons's Manual, to which reference is above made, and which, as 
stated in the title page, was adopted as a text-book at the Rensselaer 
school at Troy, was a small duodecimo volume of 230 pages. It had 
the distinction, so far as the mineralogical part was concerned, of 
being the second treatise of its kind written by an American and for 
American students, being preceded only by Cleaveland's Mineralogy, 
published in 1816. In geology it was preceded b} T the works of 
Cleaveland in 1816 and Eaton in 1818. 



2S2 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

In Emmons's work the minerals were all included in four classes, 
with an appendix which contained those minerals of which but little 
is known. The classes were subdivided, as Cleaveland and others had 
done before him, into orders, the orders again into genera, and the 
genera finally into species. His arrangement of classes was. how- 
ever, somewhat different from any of his predecessors. Thus, the 
first class included those minerals, not metallic, which are oxidable or 
which are compounds whose bases are oxidable. It comprised native 
gases and liquids, sulphur and carbon, and the carbon compounds, 
but, singularly enough, no mention was made of graphite. 

The second class included all minerals which are metallic or whoso 
bases are metallic; the third class all those which consist of an 
alkaline or earthy base in combination with acids, and the fourth 
those which consist of an earth or are compounds of earths with 
variable portions of alkaline and metallic oxides. In the seven sec- 
tions into which this last class was divided he placed quartz in all its 
varieties, siliceous slate, pumice, obsidian, clinkstone, a large number 
of hydrous and anhydrous silicates, argillite, wacke, clay, phosphates, 
etc. But little attention was given to crystallography, and "silex, 
alumnie, and lime are considered as the oldest of the earths, as they 
(Miter into the composition of the primitive rocks.' 1 Altogether 297 
species were recognized, 44 of which were mentioned in the appendix 
as little known. Many of these, such as pumice, obsidian, wacke, 
etc., can not, of course, be properly considered as minerals. In spite 
of this unintentional exaggeration, it is interesting, for purposes of 
comparison, to note that in the latest edition of Dana's Mineralogy 
(1892) 824 species were recognized. 

The part of Emmons's work devoted to geology was made up mainly 
of a ''general description of North American rocks." The classifica- 
tion adopted was the same as that used by Eaton and need not be noted 
here further than to say that he included an argillite among his primi- 
tive as well as transition rocks, while Eaton limited argillite to the tran- 
sition series, though recognizing the possibility of a primitive form. 

Among the early workers in stratigraphic geology, along lines laid 
down by Cuvier, Brongniart, and their successors, mention must be 
made of Gerard Troost, born in Holland in 1776 and dying in Nash- 
ville, Tennessee, in 1850. Like man}' naturalists of 
wo?k! ?826 His hi * time Troost was a physician. He studied in France ; 

was appointed by the King of Holland to accompany, 
in a scientific capacity, a naval expedition to Japan. He was captured 
and imprisoned by English privateers, finally returning to Paris. He 
thence took passage for New York in an American vessel and was again 
captured, this time by a French privateer, and once more imprisoned. 
On his release he went again to Paris, was again allowed to embark, 
and in 1810 came to Philadelphia.

When the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences was established in 1812 
he became its first president, holding- the office for five years, when 
he was succeeded by William Maclure. Troost, with Owen. Maclure, 
:ind others, joined the communistic society at New Harmony, Indiana, 
in L825, but removed to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1827, and the fol- 
lowing- year was elected professor of chemistry, geology, and miner- 
alogy in the university of that city. In 1831 he became State geol- 
ogist, holding the office till 1839, when it was abolished. Nine reports 
were made during his time, but seven of which were published. Prior 
to going to Tennesseee his most important geological work was a survey 
of the region about Philadelphia, the same being done and the results 
published in 1826 under the patronage of the Society for the Promo- 
tion of Agriculture. 

The work comprised forty small octavo pages with a colored map 
of the region included within a half circle north of the Delaware 
River, having a radius extending a little beyond Chester, i. e., some 
I7i miles. As may be readily supposed, fully three-fourths the area 
was colored as- gneiss, with narrower bands extending in a general 
way parallel with the river; in the northern part, of primitive clay- 
slate and of limestone. Between the gneiss and clay-slate was a short, 
narrow belt of serpentine, and between the clay-slate and limestone one 
of eurite, and in the extreme northeastern portion of the sheet a band 
of transition graywacke. Among the varieties of rocks mentioned, 
in addition to those enumerated and comprising subordinate forma- 
tions, are diabase and pegmatite. The eurite was described as occur- 
ring north of the high ridge which separates the limestone from the 
granitic rocks and as being in every respect similar to that of Penig, 
on the Erzgebirge. "I was delighted, v he wrote, "at meeting this 
rock for the first time on this side of the Atlantic. J imagined myself 
transported to the Erzgebirge, in Saxony, and remembered with 
renewed pleasure the father of geology, who made us acquainted with 
it. 11 More than half of the paper was given up to a discussion of the 
physical and chemical properties of the soil, as might be expected 
when its date and the auspices under which the work was done are 
taken into consideration. 

In the Boston Journal of Philosophy for the same year the ill-starred 

Prof. J. W. Webster gave a somewhat detailed account of the geology 

of Boston and vicinity, describing the three hills, to which "Boston 

owes its ancient name and so much of its picturesque

clay with gravel and bowlders. Amister s Hill was 
described as composed largely of clay -slate, passing on the north into 
hornblende slate, the latter containing veins of "greenstone;" and

of trap. "This hill," he wrote, "exhibits that gentle acclivity and 
rounded summit so common in the transition formations of the Wer- 
nerian school.' 1 

The Medford trap (diabase) he noted as being- unfit for architectural 
purposes, owing to its rapid disintegration, a fact which has been 
many times commented upon in more recent years. The tendency 
manifested by the "greenstone" as a whole to exfoliate in bowlder 
forms with concentric structure, he correctly ascribed to weathering, 
as did Gibson writing several years earlier (p. 254). 

lie noted the occurrence of abundant joints in the conglomerate of 
Dorchester, but considered such as inexplicable with the geological 
information then available. An interesting light is thrown upon the 
lack of knowledge of the chemical composition of rocks at that time 
in the continuation of his paper the following year, in which he 
described this conglomerate — a highly siliceous rock — as passing into 
the overlying melaphyr, a basic igneous rock. In several places 
within the town of Brighton he thought to note the transition from 
one rock type to another." 

In the American Journal of Science for 1827 Alanson Nash pre- 
sented his first, last, and only geological paper that seems to have 
found its way into print — this relating to the lead mines and veins of 
Hampshire County, Massachusetts — and offered some 
Firm S ati<^ as i h 8°27 Vein interesting speculations as to their origin. 

That the}^ were not once open fissures tilled from 
above, the fissures themselves being formed by the unequal subsidence 
of the earth's crust or through shrinkage caused by desiccation, accord • 
ing to the Neptunian theory, was to him evident for the following 
reasons: If the cavities were formed by desiccation and subsidence the 
veins would be widest at the surface and narrow as they descend, 
whereas, in fact, the very reverse is the case. If filled from above by 
mineral solutions which covered the globe, then he thought we ought 
to find beds of metallic matter in the valleys and plains also. Neither 
was he disposed to accept the views of the Plutonists, who regarded 
the veins as filled lyy "an injection from a fiery furnace below." Rather 
would he look upon them as contemporaneous both in formation and 
tilling with the rocks in which they occur, being analogous to the 
granite veins of the same region. That the vein material did not 
adhere firmly to the wall rock, as is the case with the granite veins, 

"This deceptive appearance, it may be stated, is due to the fact that the melaphyr 
at the time of its extrusion was in a highly liquid condition and flowing out over the 
uneven surface of the conglomerate rilled in all the inequalities, so closely welding 
itself as to form what was apparently one and the same mass. When subsequent 
erosion cut away a considerable portion of both rocks the appearance of isolated 
patches of melaphyr here and there on the eroded surface of the conglomerate was 
quite misleading. Some more recent observers have since committed the same 
blunder of observation and faulty deduction with far less excuse.

was to him no argument against this view. "In one ease the vein is 
lapideous. in the other it is metallic; they are different/, " 

As has been already noted, Olmsted's work in North Carolina 

was continued after his resignation by Prof. Elisha Mitchell, who 

was transferred from the chair of mathematics to that of chemistry, 

mineralogy, and geology at the time of Olmsted's 

Elisha Mitchell's rpsirrrmtinn 

Work, 1827-28. i e&iguauuii. 

Like Olmsted, Mitchell was born in Connecticut and 
graduated at Yale, going to North Carolina about the same time as did 
the former. He was known as a man of great culture and erudition, 
but had manifested no indications of a particular leaning toward geol- 
ogy until the transfer above noted, and to-day his fame probably rests 
more upon his knowledge of the physical geography and botany of 
North Carolina than of its geology. He was 
an enthusiastic explorer and collector, and, 
as is well known, finally lost his life on Black. 
now Mitchell, Mountain in 1857. 

His two most important papers on geology 
were published in 1828 and 1829, the first 
relating to the origin of the low country of 
North Carolina and the second to the geology 
of the gold regions. In 1812 he published 
a summary of his work in the form of a 
text-book for his classes, accompanied by a 
small geological map of the State, the only 
map of its kind thus far prepared. A re- 
port on the mineralogy of the State was 
also prepared by his assistant, C. E. Rothe, 

of Saxony, in 1827. A geological map of the eastern half of the 
State was said to have been made, but never published. 

Mitchell, in his paper on the origin of the low country, took the 
ground that the various strata there found were formed in the bed of 
the sea and became dry land through the depression of the level of the 
ocean or the elevation of the land by a force operating from beneath. 
The shells found by him in these beds proved, in his judgment, that 
they were of comparatively recent origin, but just how recent he was 
not prepared to say. The presence of bones of elephants and masto- 
dons, however, indicated to his mind an elevation prior to the Noaehian 
deluge, to which catastrophe he evidently attributed their burial.

286 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

In 1829 Mitchell published in the American Journal of Science an 

article in which he threw doubt upon the statements and theories of 

Olmsted and Rothe regarding the origin and occurrence of gold in the 

State. It will be remembered that Olmsted considered 

Mitcfiell's Criticism .. .. . , . . , , . ,, 

of Olmsted and Rothe, the gold to be limited to the area occupied by the 

i 829 

argillite, while Rothe considered granite as the base 
of the gold-bearing formations. Olmsted further argued that the gold 
occurred in the diluvial formation, while Rothe believed that the gold 
now found in the alluvial was derived from veins and spread over the 
country by a flood of waters breaking through the Blue Ridge and 
rushing in torrents over the entire gold-bearing region/' 

Mitchell's idea, which is undoubtedly the correct one, was that the 
gold occurred originally in veins and perhaps in part disseminated 
throughout the country rock, which was in itself in part primitive and 
in part secondary. From these rocks it was set free through atmos- 
pheric decomposition and subsequently distributed by gravity and 
running water. 

Mitchell's paper is of further interest in that it contains a colored 
geological map of the gold region, the rocks being classified as primi- 
tive, transition or slate, old-red sandstone, and alluvium. 

Although the da}^ of the cosmogonist was fast drifting into the 
obscurity of the past, there were, nevertheless, occasional writers 
who still preferred to ignore facts of observation or the efficiency of 
simple causes and to seek for more difficult or more 
tJ?e P r>?ft S /i d 828° n mystical methods of accounting for phenomena than 
those furnished by the observation of processes now 
in action. Thus Benjamin Tappan, in discussing the bowlders of prim- 
itive and transition rock found in Ohio (glacial erratics), objected to the 
commonly accepted idea that such were necessarily foreign to the local- 
ity, brought by currents of water or floating ice in immense inland lakes. 
He frankly acknowledged, however, his own inability to account for 
their presence, but ingenuously claimed that "ignorance is preferable 
to error," ancLadded: "It may therefore be asked why ma} T not these 
rocks have been created where they are now found?" Or, "Again, 
why may they not have been thrown out by earthquakes or volcanoes? " 

Groping though this writer may have been, it is questionable if his 
ignorance were not preferable to the kind of knowledge manifested 
by a writer (signature "A") in the American Journal of Science of 
two years previous, who would account for the drift on the supposition 
that the earth's revolution, amounting to 1,500 feet a second, was 
suddenly checked. This, he thought, would result in the whole mass 



« Rothe had previously (1826) expressed the idea that the gold was derived from 
the bursting asunder of the gold-bearing veins by subterranean explosions and the 
gold thus scattered over the adjacent regions, some of it being carried down in the 
water courses. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY EATONIAN ERA, 1820-1829. 287 

of the surface water rushing forward with inconceivable velocity, 
until overcome by opposing obstacles or exhausted by continual fric- 
tion and the counterbalancing power of gravitation. The Pacific 
Ocean would thus rush over the Andes and the Alleghenies into the 
Atlantic, which would in the meantime be sweeping over Europe, 
Asia, and Africa. "A few hours would cover the entire surface of 
the earth, excepting, perhaps, the vicinity of the poles, with one 
rushing torrent, in which the fragments of disintegrated rock, earth, 
and sand would be carried along with the wreck of animal and vege- 
table life in one all but liquid mass." 

The period that may with propriety be called the dark age of geol- 
ogy was that prior to the discovery and general recognition of the 
value of fossils in stratigraphy — the fact that the relative age or 
stratigraphic sequence of sedimentary rocks could be 
Qeoio* 31 * Ages °' determined by means of the plant and animal remains 
they may contain. 

According to Dr. Archibald Geikie, in his Founders of Geology, 
credit must be given to the Abbe Giraud-Soulavie for having first 
planted the seeds of stratigraphic geology. In a paper read before 
the Royal Academy of Scientists in Paris in August, 1779, Soulavie 
described the calcareous mountains Vivarais as made up of limestones 
belonging to five different epochs, the strata in each being marked by 
its own peculiar assemblage of fossils. 

These views, though undoubtedly correct in the main, were not 
generally accepted even in France, a fact thought by Doctor Geikie 
to be due mainly to the wretched style in which they were set forth, 
and the Abbe's fame has been eclipsed by more brilliant successors, 
among whom may be mentioned Desmarest, Kouelle, Lamanon. 
Cuvier, and Brongniart. 

Cuvier, it will be recalled, was primarily a biologist, and may well 
be considered the first vertebrate paleontologist — the first to announce 
that the globe was once peopled by vertebrate animals of a type which 
have long since disappeared. In connection with Brongniart, Cuvier 
published in lNOS a memoir containing the results of their joint studies 
in the basin of the Seine. Thev showed that the formations there 
existing were arranged in a definite order and could be recognized by 
their lithological and paleontological characteristics. Although sub- 
sequent research has naturally tended to show that the observations 
and deductions of these early workers were not in all cases correct, it 
mav, nevertheless, be said that they established on a basis of accurate 
observation the principles of paleontological stratigraphy, demon- 
strated the use of fossils for the determination of geological chronol- 
ogy, and paved the way for the enormous advances which have since 
been made. 



288 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

When one recalls the avidity with which each new suggestion is 
seized upon by the scientists of to-day, it seems strange that . so 
promising a field of investigation as was here thrown open should not 

have been immediately occupied. Nevertheless, it 
Co™eia«on! P i t 82 t 8. was not until 1828 that an American geologist took up 

the matter with an apparently full appreciation of its 
possibilities. In that year Dr. S. G. Morton, the paleontologist, read 
before the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences, from notes furnished 
him by Lardner Vanuxem, what was probably the most important 
paper of the year, relating to a possible subdivision of the heretofore 
so-called alluvial or Tertiary deposits of the Atlantic coast. The most 
important feature of this paper, as may be surmised, lay in its 
announced recognition of the value of fossils for purposes of correla- 
tion. With the exception of Prof. John Finch, already mentioned, 
writers up to this time had very generally referred to these deposits 
as belonging to a single formation, either alluvial or Tertiary, as the 
case might be. Vanuxem here asserted for the first time the exist- 
ence of both Secondary and Tertiary formations, and showed "that 
the two formations may be at all times unequivocally identified by 
their fossil remains." The relative geological position of the beds he 
gave as below:

In L828 Dr. C. T. Jackson, of Boston, in company with Francis 

Alger, published in the American Journal of Science a series of papers 

bearing on the mineralogy and geology of a part of Nova Scotia. 

These, although mainly of a mineralogical nature, con-

and were accompanied by a colored geological maps 
This showed the distribution of the various geological formation, 
(identified mainly on lithological grounds) of the northern half of the 
peninsula. A broad belt of transition clay-slate was represented as 
extending from the Gut of Canso to St. Marys Bay. This was bor 
dered on the northeast by a narrow bed of alluvium, the immediate 
border of the Bay of Fundy being occupied b} r trap rock or greenstone, 
as it was then called. A wide band, of red and gray sandstone, alter- 
nating with shale and carrying beds of coal, occupied the region south 
of Minas Basin and all of the Cumberland County peninsula. This 
sandstone was described in considerable detail, and from its fossil con- 
tents was judged to be a secondary rock, although evidently older than

the trap —a recognition here of the value of fossils for stratigraphic 
purposes. 

The clay-slate of the South Mountains he regarded as belonging to 
the transition class, since it dips .50 or 60 to the northwest, while 
the sandstone dips at an angle of only lo or 15° to the north, clearly 
indicating the former rock to be of greater antiquity than the latter. 
Moreover the slate contained only marine fossils. It was regarded 
also as having existed before the neighboring plutonic rocks had 
emerged from the central region of the earth. 

The granite was regarded as being undoubtedly of greater age than 
the clay-slate, since it contained '"no relics of organized beings." He 
did not, however, consider it as belonging to the oldest primitive 
rocks, since it showed at places a brecciated structure, contained black 
mica, and was "lacking in the metalliferous compounds and minerals 
which characterize the ancient formations." "It probably belongs," 
he wrote, '"to the third or newest formation of Werner." 

Concerning the source of the trap and its relationship to the sand- 
stone, he wrote: 

The sharp fragments of the breccia and the breaking up of the strata also shew 
that the production of this rock or, rather, its nonconformable position on the sand- 
stone strata, was effected suddenly. Whether it was ejected from the inaccessible 
depths of the Basin of Minas, or was thrown directly up through the strata of sand- 
stone, we can not determine; but the occurrence of the trap only on the borders of 
the basin, which it almost surrounds, leads to the belief that this cavity was the 
crater, if it may be so called, from which, in former times, the trap rocks issued. 
The same remarks will apply to the whole North Mountain range, except that they 
probably originated from the unfathomable deeps of the Bay of Fundy, which is 
completely skirted on either side by trap rocks. 

It will be noted here that Jackson for the first time cut loose from 
the Wernerian (Neptunian) doctrine. He realized this and stated that 
the evidence found convinced him of its insufficiency, and he was 
obliged to allow the superiority of the igneous theory as taught b} T 
Hutton, Play fair, and Daubenv. 

Writing of the origin of the bed of hematite iron ore of the South 
Mountain region and its relation to the granites, he said: 

Speculative geologists would doubtless regard the protrusion of the granite from 
the central regions of our globe as the cause of the disruption of the strata of clay- 
slate which was thus raised from the bottom of the sea, bearing with it the spoils 
of the ocean. The layers would thus be broken, their edges thrown up at an angle, 
and, by the contraction of the subordinate rocks, the superior strata being fixed, 
or the protrusion having carried the rocks so far as to poise the strata in a per- 
pendicular position, a chasm would be formed into which the ore of iron was after- 
wards poured from above by a second submergence. From the similarity of fossils 
we should think the bed of iron ore must have been immediately formed after the 
disruption of the strata, 

In 183)-) a revised edition of the work was published in the Memoirs 
of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. This was referred to

by Featherstonhaugh in his journal, as "the neatest and best executed 
work on geology which has been gotten up in the United States/' 

Dr. Charles T. Jackson was born at Plymouth, Massachusetts, June 
21, 1805; was graduated at the Harvard Medical School in 1829, and 
settled down to the practice of medicine in Boston in 1833, having 
spent a portion of the intervening years in Europe. 
c k T C JacLon He shortly , however, abandoned his medical practice 

in order that he might devote himself to chemical and 
geological investigations more to his taste. In 1836. he was appointed 
State geologist of Maine, and published during the three years he held 
that office three octavo reports comprising some 1,000 pages and an 
atlas of 21 plates. These volumes, while recording a large number 
of disconnected observations, contain nothing of striking interest or 
importance. They are devoted also largely to economic questions. 
It must lie remembered, however, that the country at that time was 
largely a wilderness, without rail or carriage roads, and many of his 
journeys were made by canoes on streams and lakes. 

In 1839, as State geologist, he made a survey of Rhode Island, and 
in the year following submitted the manuscript copy for his report, 
1,000 copies of which were issued, constituting the first, last, and 
only official account of the resources of the State ever published 
(Wood worth). In 1810 he began work upon the geology of New 
Hampshire, having been appointed geologist for that State September, 
1839. This survey lasted until 1813, the final report appearing in 
1811. It was while in the prosecution of this work that he made the 
discovery of tin ore at Jackson, and from it smelted the first bar of 
metallic tin produced in America. 

In 1817 Jackson was appointed United States geologist to report on 
the public lands in the Lake Superior region, but spent only two 
seasons in the field, resigning for personal and political reasons in 
1849. It was through his instrumentality, however, in part, that the 
copper regions of Lake Superior were opened up. Other economic 
work of Jackson which needs mention is that in connection with the dis- 
covery and description of the emery mines at Chester, Massachusetts. 

After withdrawing from the Lake Superior survey, Jackson devoted 
himself largely to laboratory work, having an office at 32 Somerset 
street, Boston. As is well known, he was one of the claimants for 
priority in the discovery of the "anaesthetic properties of ether. He 
was well and favorably known as a chemist and all-round naturalist, 
and is described as "an enthusiastic personage, a ready conversation- 
alist, even eloquent in his speech and fond of story telling — a man of 
large stature, square shoulders, and massive head." As a geologist 
he was conservative almost to the point of obstinacy, as is shown by 
his steady adherence to the older forms of classification, though find- 
ing it necessary to depart somewhat from the ideas of Werner. He

was but little given to theorizing-, at least so far as is shown by his 
published works, and announced few, if any, new principles. His 
fame rests rather upon the extension of the geographic boundaries of 
our knowledge and the development of economic resources. 

The matter of the relative age of rocks as indicated by their position 
with respect to horizontal ity, which had been discussed by Cleaveland 
in 1816, Maclure in 1825, and Jackson in 1828, was again taken up by 
Vanuxem in 1829. In a paper in the American Jour- 
vanuxem's Views, na j Q £ Science in this year he called attention to sev- 
eral errors promulgated by the American geologists, 
the first of which related to the existence of Alluvium and Tertiary 
rocks in the Southern Atlantic States, as he had previously announced 
in conjunction with Morton. 

Of almost equal importance was the objection raised at this time to 
the prevailing assumption that all of the so-called secondary rocks 
were horizontal in position, or, on the other hand, that all horizontal 
rocks were, therefore, secondary. He pointed out that rocks com- 
posed of mechanical particles when undisturbed would form horizon- 
tally lying masses, but that both uplifting and downfalling forces had 
existed and there was no certainty that such had acted in a uniform 
manner, giving rocks of the same age the same inclination. There- 
fore the position of beds as regards horizontal ity, he. argued, could 
not be relied upon to indicate age. "The analogy or identity of 
rocks," he wrote, "I determine by their fossils in the first instance 
and their position and mineralogi-cal characters in the second or last 
instance." This is perhaps one of the most important generalizations 
that had thus far been made by any American geologist. 

Vanuxem was a Philadelphian by birth, but received his mineral- 
ogies,] and geological training at the School of Mines in Paris at the 
time when Brongniart and Hauv were both active. Graduating in 
1819, he returned to America and assumed the chair 
vanuxem. of chemistry in Columbia College, South Carolina, 

resigning in 1826 to undertake some private mining 
work in Mexico. In 1830 he removed to a farm near Bristol, Penn- 
sylvania, which continued to be his home during the rest of his life, 
though connected with the New York State survey during 1837-13. 

He is represented as a man of slight build, active and energetic, and 
with great powers of endurance; one who loved his work for the 
work's sake, and was always averse to receiving pay for his services 
excepting when circumstances rendered it absolutely necessary. 

According to his biographer, he had the reputation of being vision- 
ary and full of untenable theories. Be this as it may, his published 
writings show no such failing, and there are few men of his day who 
saw more clearly or reasoned more correctly. His published writings 
were, for that time, remarkably free from error. As a geologist he

ranks with those who have put forward new ideas rather than those 
who have extended geographic boundaries." 

In 1829 there appeared the tirst American, from the third English, 

edition of Bakewell's Introduction to Geology. This was edited by 

Silliman, and was accompanied by the hitter's Outline of the Course 

of Geological Lectures given in Yale College. The

in the preface, was that he might place in the hands of 
his classes a comprehensive treatise on geology which the} 7 "would be 
willing to read and able to understand. 11 ■ The lecture notes, which 
merit our attention here, comprised 126 pages and may be reviewed 
in some detail as illustrating the character of instruction given at that 
time. 

Silliman announced himself as being neither a Wernerian nor Hut- 
tonian, but simply a student of facts. The classification was, how- 
ever, largely Wernerian, though he says: "It is one of convenience 
merely, and therefore there is no hesitation in deviating from it, or 
in substituting other views, when they appear preferable. 11 The dis- 
coveries of geology he regarded as consistent with the biblical account, 
and "respecting the deluge, there can be but one opinion * * * 
geology fully confirms the scripture history of that event. 11 

The earth, he conceived, as at an early stage covered superficially by 
a watery abyss, containing in solution acids and alkalies such as would 
augment its solvent powers. He regarded the solubility of all the 
existing elements forming the crust of the globe as clearly and actu- 
al^ demonstrated, but found a serious difficulty in attributing to the 
quantity of waters that now exist * * * sufficient power to sus- 
pend all the materials of those rocks that bear marks of deposition from 
a state of chemical solution. Among other possibilities he, however, 
seriously considered that of a portion of the then existing waters hav- 
ing " been received into cavities of the earth, to await a future call to 
deluge the surface anew." From this solution the primitive rocks — 
granite, gneiss, mica, slate, and some of the limestones — were regarded 
as having been deposited, the author thus far following Werner. 

The question as to the origin of mountains and of the continents 
was, with him, a vexed one. "Some imagine that entire mountain 
ranges and even entire continents have been raised by the force of 
subterranean fire," and he saw no inconsistency in admitting that both 
igneous and aqueous agencies might have been active in their produc- 
tion. But, as to the source of the materials from which they were 
formed, he felt by no means clear. If supplied from regions imme-

tions with those. of New York, identifying the lower rocks of Ohio, Kentucky, and 
Tennessee with the Trenton limestone.

diateh' beDeath, what fills the void? he asked. If it is arched over 
from side to side, what security is there that subterranean tires will 
not melt down the abutments and undermine the continent? But, 
whether the mountains were raised from below, left prominent by the 
subsidence of the contiguous regions, or were reared by accumulation, 
he regarded as immaterial for his present purpose. "It is agreed on 
all hands that they existed before the subsidence of the early ocean, 
whose retreat must of course have first exposed their summits." 

Among the rocks belonging to the transition period he included the 
crystalline limestones — marbles — of Bennington, Middlebury, and 
Swanton in Vermont; the graywackes of the Chaudiere Falls in Lower 
Canada, of Rhode Island, and of the Catskill Mountains; the breccia 
marble of Point of Rocks, Maryland; and the conglomerates of Dor- 
chester and other locatities in Massachusetts. These, as is well known, 
are now relegated to various widely separated horizons, extending 
from the Cambrian in the case of the Swanton marbles to the Triassic 
in the case of that of Point of Rocks. 

The manner in which the fossil organisms were conceived to have 
become imbedded in their various matrices is interesting: 

We can not doubt that the animals received their existence and lived and died in 
an ocean full of carbonate of lime, in solution, or in mechanical suspension, or both. 
When they died they of course subsided to the bottom and were surrounded, as they 
lay, by the concreting calcareous matter; * * * the interstices were filled by the 
calcareous deposit, and this being more or less chemically dissolved, produced a 
firm, subcrystalline mass, a section of which shows the animals sawn through. 

Concerning the value of such remains, he was fully cognizant: 
"Fossil organic bodies contained in rocks are now considered as good 
indicia of the geological age and character of the strata in which they 
occur.' 1 

As with others of his time, Silliman was a believer in the Noachian 
deluge. Indeed, in point of detail, he outdid all others in his attempts 
at harmonizing apparently conflicting statements and ideas and wrote, 
as Huxley has aptly expressed it, "with one eye on fact and the other 
on Genesis." 1 "There is decisive evidence that not further back than 
a few thousand years an universal deluge swept the surface of the 
globe." This deluge, it should be remarked, was considered quite dis- 
tinct from the original, primeval ocean, and to have been brought 
about through direct intervention of the Creator for the purpose of 
punishing and partially exterminating the race. It was sudden in its 
occurrence, short in duration, and violent in its effects. In order to 
account for the biblical expression, "the fountains of the great deep were 
broken up, 11 Silliman offered the suggestion that, contemporaneous 
with the fort}' da} T s and nights of rain, a deluge of water burst forth 
from the bowels of the earth, whence it was forced by the sudden dis- 
engagement of gases, the presence of the subterranean water he having

already conveniently accounted for by assuming- that it was derived 
from the primeval ocean at the time it shrank away and left the dry 
land. Sufficient water to cover, when forced to the surface, the high- 
est mountains, could, he calculated, be contained in a cavity the cubical 
content of which was only one two hundred and sixty -fifth part of the 
globe. 

Assuming that the antediluvian mountains were the same as to-day, 
but somewhat higher (say, 5i miles), and accepting the fact that they 
were covered by the water, Silliman proceeded to show that, with a 
time limit of forty days, the water rose at the rate of a foot in two 
minutes — i. e., 30 feet an hour, or 1S1 feet in the time of a common 
flood or ebb tide, 362 feet in the time of the ordinary ebb and flow of 
the tide, or 726 feet in twenty-four hours. 

The inequalities in the surface of the land would, however, increase 
even this rate, and a very graphic picture is drawn of k 'the incon- 
ceivably violent torrents and cataracts everywhere descending the 
hills and mountains and meeting a tide rising at the rate of more than 
TOO feet in twenty-four hours.'' 

It is to such a catastrophe that he believed to be due the extinction 
of whole races of vertebrate animals, like the Siberian mammoth and 
others. That such would be amply sufficient no one will be likely to 
doubt. 



CHAPTER III. 

THE ERA OF STATE SURVEYS, FIRST DECADE, 1830-1839. 

The decade beginning with 1830 stands out prominently as an era of 
public surveys. With the exception of the single abortive attempt 
made in North Carolina in 1824 no surveys at other than private 
expense had thus far been attempted, though the subject had more 
than once been agitated. During this interval, however, scarcely a 
year passed but witnessed the establishment of a State survey or the 
organization of an exploring expedition, to which a geologist was 
attached. Thus were established surveys in Massachusetts in 1830; 
in Tennessee in .1831; Maryland in 1834; New Jersey, Connecticut, 
and Virginia in 1835; Maine, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania in 
1836; Delaware, Indiana, and Michigan in 183?, and in New Hamp- 
shire and Rhode Island in 1839. In addition, the United States Gov- 
ernment for the first time recognized the practical utility of the 
geologist by authorizing the surveys by G. W. Featherstonhaugh of 
the elevated country between the Missouri and Red rivers in 1834 and 
of the Coteau des Prairies in 1835, and by D. D. Owen of the mineral 
lands of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois in 1839. 

The Wilkes exploring expedition, with J. D. Dana as geologist, was 
also organized and sent on its way in 1838. Beyond the limits of the 
United States Abraham Gesner was doing important work as provin- 
cial geologist in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Eaton and Maclure 
were still in the field, but new workers were rapidly forcing their way 
to the front, and the influence of the two pioneers was already on the 
wane. Other names which appear in this decade and grow to prom- 
inence are Timothy A. Conrad, James Hall, William Mather, D. D. 
Owen, J. G. Percival, and H. D. Rogers. 

In 1830 Eaton published the first edition of his Geological Text-book, 

an octavo volume of 64 pages, accompanied by a colored geological map 

exhibiting a general view of the economic geology of New York and part 

of the adjoining States, the work for which had been

Rensselaer. 
The book is worthy of a somewhat extended notice, since it gives us 
an insight into the character of the instruction furnished students at 
that time at the Rensselaer Institute, and also, since it was Eaton's 
second attempt at preparing a text-book. His first attempt, it will be 
remembered, was his Index to the Geology of the Northern States, 

295 



2% REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

published in 1N18, a second edition of which appeared in 1820. In 
these works he was anticipated only by Parker Cleaveland's Text-book 
of Geology and Mineralogy, which appeared in 1816, though the volume 
we arc now discussing was anticipated in 1826 by the work of Emmons. 

Eaton's general views regarding the formation of the various geolog- 
ical deposits are summed up as follows: "The earth is composed of 
masses of rocks and detritus which are more or less extensive and uni- 
form in their characteristic constituents." "These masses are mostly 
in regular deposits, and those of the same structure and composition 
regard the same order of superposition in relation to each other. 1 '' A 
few of the outermost masses, having no reference to each other, he 
called "anomalous deposits." He divided these regular deposits into 
live series, called classes, each of which "consists of three formations 
which are found to be corresponding equivalents in all the series. 
The lowest formation in each series is slaty or argillaceous and always 
contains beds of carbon in the state of coal, anthracite, or plumbago." 
The next is silicious and destitute of beds of carbon, and the upper- 
most, also lacking in carbon, is composed chiefly of carbonate of lime. 

All the primitive formations he regarded as deposited in the form of 
concentric spheres like the coats of an onion. These contained the 
materials of which all outer formations were afterwards made up. 
"Soon after these deposits were laid down they were broken up 
through several northerly and southerly rents by a very great force 
exerted immediately beneath the lowest of the primitive strata. In 
this semi -indurated and broken state materials were readily furnished 
for the outer strata." The source of the force producing these rents, 
it will be remembered, was in his early works regarded as problematical 
(p. 238). 

In this last work he, however, solved the problem in a manner best 
understood by reference to the figures here reproduced, which he 
claimed were an improvement on those given in the Index. 

The earth is here supposed to be cut into two parts at the forty- 
second degree of north latitude. Large bodies of combustibles of an 
undetermined nature, it will be observed, are conveniently stored 
under what are now the regions of maximum disturbance, as the Rocky 
Mountains. New England, Great Britain, the Alps, Pyrenees, Caucasus, 
and the Himalayas. 

In the second figure combustion is supposed to have taken place, 
whereby an explosion was produced which burst through the primitive 
and transition series, and appalling indeed must have been the results. 

A geological segment, not reproduced here, gives in greater detail 
a section across the American continent, showing the internal nucleus, 
the areas of combustible matter under New York State and the Rocky 
Mountains, and the alternation of the regular deposits, illustrating 
his ideas as to the present condition of the earth. The combustible

materials at this time are supposed to be nearly exhausted, although 
still sufficient to cause ordinary earthquakes. 

The superficial rocks of the crust, as shown in this section, were 
divided into four series, each of which was made up, in ascending order, 
of Carboniferous, Quartzose and Calcareous rocks. The definitions 
of the various classes forming the transition and secondary remained 
much as in the early work, excepting that he divided his Class III 
into a lower and upper division and added a fifth series, the Tertiary, 
this latter including those strata which contained remains of viviparous 
vertebral animals. 

The so-called anomalous deposits were those which have been pro- 
duced at the earth's surface by fusion or disintegration of regular 
strata, and were divided into (1) Volcanic deposits, (2) Diluvion, (3) 
Postdiluvion, and (-±) Analluvion, the last including what are known 
as residual deposits — that is, those which result from decay in situ. 

In the second edition of this work, published in 1832, the same gen- 
eral ideas were advanced regarding the formation and uplifting of the 
various rocks; a much more satisfactory chapter added on the charac- 
ter and objects of geology, and also a chapter on organized remains 
as auxiliaries in the determination of rocky strata, in this respect the 
second edition being decidedly in advance of the first/' 

Many of the ideas put forward in the chapter on the character and 
objects of geology are, in the light of to-day, peculiarly interesting. 
The desire to harmonize all phenomena witnessed with the biblical 
account of the deluge was still manifested: 

Geological facts lead us to the history of created beings long anterior to written 
records. Such records may be erroneous, and we have no means of correcting 
them. But geological records are perpetual, unvarying, and can not be vitiated by 
interpolations or counterfeits. For example: The written history of the deluge 
might be varied more or less by erroneous copies and incorrect translations. But 
the geological records of divine wrath poured out upon the rebellious inhabitants of 
the earth at that awful period can never be effaced or changed. These later records 
add, to the Mosaic account, that even the antediluvial beasts of the forests and fens 
partook of the ferocious nature and giant strength of antediluvial man. 

The bed of Lake Ontario Eaton regarded as made by the rapid dis- 
integration of Saliferous and Carboniferous rock, while the beds of 
Lake Champlain and the Mohawk and Hudson rivers were thought to 
have originated, for the most part, bj T the disintegration of rocks at

line of contact between different formations. tw The deep bed of the 
Hudson across the Highlands, however, may, without extravagance, 
be ascribed to the fusion by volcanic heat which produced the basaltic 
Palisades below the chasm. The same hypothesis may be well applied 
to the channel of the Connecticut River north of the northern line of 
Massachusetts, whence the volcanic lava flowed which now covers a 
series of basaltic prominences which form the northern part of Long- 
Island Sound. " And this as Late as L830-1832! Yet the Rensselaer 
school, where Eaton was teaching, was, and continued to be for many 
years, the chief training school for American geologists. Fortunately, 
his students were taught to think and not to blindly follow. 

Eaton claimed at this date (1832) to have devoted more time and 
labor to American geology than any other individual, and credits Gen. 
Stephen Van Rensselaer with having furnished the necessary facilities. 
''I made the first attempt,* 1 he wrote, ''at a systematic arrangement 
of American rock strata/' The various discoveries which he thought 
might be claimed as having been made under the auspices above noted 
are as follows: 

(1) That each of the classes of rocks always begins with a Carbonif- 
erous slate and terminates with calcareous rocks, having a middle 
formation of quartzose. 

(2) The discovery of ferriferous stratum containing argillaceous 
iron ores, and which extends unbroken from near Utica to the extreme 
termination of Lake Ontario, in Upper Canada. 

(3) That the bog-ore properly belongs to the Tertiary formation. 
(•i) That talcose slate is the grand repository of hematitic iron ore, 

peroxide of manganese, and native gold. 

(5) That the Corniferous lime rock is the true carboniferous only. 

(6) That crystalline granite is not entitled to a place among general 
strata, as it is never found other than as a bed or vein. 

(7) That granular quartz rock and granular lime rock are entitled to 
a place among general strata. 

(8) That all primitive rocks, excepting granular quartz and lime 
rocks, are contemporaneous. 

('.)) That there is evidence of a diluvian stratum having been depos- 
ited near the termination of the deluge, which formed an universal 
mantle about the earth. 

In discussing the "regular" deposits, he wrote: 

They exhibit grounds for conjecture, if not absolute demonstration, that the 
surface of the earth had undergone five general modifications which no animals 
survived. Four of these modifications were followed by as many new creations of 
animals, two new creations succeeding the final depositions of all regular strata. In 
the whole there appeared to have been five creations of animals at least, and per- 
haps ten, since the primitive mass of earth was formed. 



300 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

In his chapter on soils, it is instructive to note, he recognized and 
emphasized a principle now generally accepted, to the effect that the 
fertility of the soils does not depend upon ultimate chemical constitu- 
tion„ but rather upon physical properties; that a fertile soil should 
contain, first, sufficient stones and pebbles to keep it open and loose; 
second, sufficient clay to absorb and hold water in the right propor- 
tion; and third, sufficient fine sand to prevent the clay from baking in 
time of drought. 

That the fertility of a soil could not be told by a chemical analysis 
had been stated by him some years earlier, as follows: 

Suppose, in one specimen, the soil, etc., should he quartz, in another feldspar, in 
another hornblende, in another sapphire, in another diamond, would there be any 
difference in the influence of the sand, etc., upon the productive quality of the soil 
on account of the different ultimate elements of which these different minerals are 
composed? Should they be so far decomposed, at some future period, as to become 
an impalpable powder, perhaps they may then differ in their influence upon vegeta- 
tion. Perhaps we may foretell the future state of the country a century or two to 
come, where such extreme disintegration is effected. But the difference in the ulti- 
mate constituents can not possibly affect the question of fertility or barrenness at the 
time tin' analysis is made. For whatever effect can be ascribable to the one is equally 
a property of the other. They all hold water on their surfaces by the attraction of 
adhesion; they all keep the soil duly open and porous to give passage to the roots of 
vegetables; they all aid alike in bracing up plants and in keeping them in a fixed 
position, etc;. Whatever is effected by one is effected by all— size, form, quantity, 
and all circumstances, other than their constituent elements, agreeing." 

To this second edition he added a chapter of some 11 pages on the 
science of mining, one of 12 pages on localities, and 5 pages on fossils. 
His gradually expanding views as to the value of fossils in geological 
work are shown in his paper on Geological Equivalents of this year 
(1832). He here advanced the idea that the enumeration of the min- 
eral constituents of rocks could never be satisfactorily applied for the 
determination of the relative position of strata, but that recourse must 
be had to the organic remains. " We find the same organized remains 
associated with equivalent strata in every part of the earth."' * 

If we are to judge from the preface of the edition of 1830, Eaton 
was by no means lacking in egotism, and had, at times, an unfortunate 
way of expressing his opinions, such as must have aroused antagonism 

"American Journal of Science, XII, June, 1827, p. 870. 

''The hrst edition of Eaton's work was somewhat savagely reviewed by a writer in 
the North American Review for April, 1831. From its perusal one might be led to 
suppose that the following extract from a letter by Eaton to Silliman in 1839 had a 
sounder basis than Eaton would himself be likely to acknowledge. He wrote: "I 
was one of your earliest correspondents on geology, consequently it is to be presumed 
that I have introduced more errors to the public through your journal than any other 
individual." Most writers will say things of themselves which they would resent if 
said by others. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1830-1839. 301 

in the minds of his collaborators. Thus,, in referring to the work just 
mentioned, he wrote: 

A text-book is too small a name for these days of puffing arrogance. But I propose 
to present all my supposed heresies to the geological fraternity in this form and under 
this title. And I beg the favor of the most rigorous criticism upon this book, small 
as it is. To stimulate men of science to the work of examination and of criticism, I 
will state that I intend to publish considerable in scientific journals, also a full 
system upon this plan. As I have had more than 7,000 pupils already (rather 
auditors) , and shall probably have more still, it will be well for them " to be on the 
alert" if I am propagating errors. I am not in sport; I have, during the last fifteen 
years, traveled over 17,000 miles for the express purpose of collecting geological 
materials, the results of which are comprised in this little octavo pamphlet and 
exhibited in the accompanying map and wood cuts. 

I may be accused of fickleness, on account of the changes which appear in every 
successive book I publish. I confess this is the ninth time 1 have published a geo- 
logical nomenclature, and that I made changes in each of more or less importance. 
But I have always consulted my scientific friends, and every change was founded on 
new discoveries in "matters of fact." 

And further on: 

Students for whom this text-book is intended may feel no interest in anything 
personal relating to myself. But I will throw this paragraph in their way. 1 have 
been accused of arrogance for stating facts relating to American geology without 
formally bowing to European authorities. * * * I confess that this is a kind of 
"ipse dixit " text-book. It is so, because the plan does not admit of demonstration. 
In a future publication I intend to cite authorities from nature to illustrate my 
views. But I am prepared to abandon any of them, as I have frequently done here- 
tofore, in cases of numerous errors, to which I am still subject. 

Geology is a progressive science, and he who has any respect for his future repu- 
tation should be exceedingly cautious about committing himself on matters of fact 
or speculation. I confess that I have most egregiously violated this rule, but there 
are peculiar circumstances in my case, arising from my being "a hireling drudge" 
to the most munificent patron of this science (Stephen Van Rensselaer), which will 
palliate, at least, if not justify. 

I despise arrogance; but I am within sixteen years of the "three score and ten," 
when the mind of man is averaged beyond the period of vigorous effort. About two 
score of these years have been devoted to natural science. I offer this as an apology 
for some dogmas forbidden to youth." 

In July of 1831 there appeared the first number of G. W. Feather- 
stonhaugh's Monthly American Journal of Geology and Natural His- 
tory. This proved a short-lived but vigorously conducted journal in 
.... . which essays on geoiogT, as understood by the editor, 

Monthly American • i i i • . 

Journal of Geology, occupied a leading part in each number. Troubles, 
financial and otherwise, beset the venture, and amongst 
the "otherwise" may be mentioned a lack of appreciation and support 
where he apparently had a right to expect both. "So that a work 
which has hitherto been stamped with general approbation, * * * 

"One can almost imagine him saying with Emerson "What is well done I feel as 
if I did, what is ill done I reck not of,"

has not been permitted to have a single subscriber in New Haven, the 
pretended seat of an American Geological Society," is his fierce plaint 
in the ninth issue." 

Featherstonhaugh was a man of English birth and some means, who 
came to America when quite young apparently merely through love of 

« Featherstonhaugh' s efforts seem to have been better appreciated abroad than at 
home, if we may judge from the following: 

The editor lays before his readers, with a just pride and entire satisfaction, the 
following communication from the president of the Geological Society of London, 
and other distinguished naturalists: 

London, June 18, 1831. 
My Dear Sir: We, your undersigned friends in England, are happy to learn that 
you propose to establish a new periodical work in the United States, which, in 
embracing all subjects connected with the natural history of America, is to be 
specially devoted to the accumulation of geological facts and phenomena. 

Knowing your zeal and ability, we have great hopes that a work so directed will 
meet with every encouragement in your country, and we are certain that it can not 
but be of service to the cause of science in general. 

We shall at all times be desirous of aiding you with any communication in our 
power, and we subscribe ourselves, 
Yours, very faithfully,

P. S. — I can not refrain, in particular, on my own part, from expressing the desire 
which I feel for the appearance of the proposed publication, as likely to conduce in 
the most important points to the effective progress of geology; to ascertain in detail 
the suite of formations, and the series of organic remains distinguishing them in a 
new continent, so widely separated from the old, and embracing such a range of vari- 
ous climate. So to compare the phenomena with those of Europe has ever appeared 
to me the most material desideratum in geology, for we may be sure that any analo- 
gies which are common to localities geographically so distant, and placed under 
physical conditions so distinct, are, in truth, analogies belonging generally to the 
whole globe; and thus we shall obtain data adequate for the foundation of a general 
geological theory. 

Well acquainted with the attention you have paid to the formations on this side of 
the Atlantic, I am convinced that the execution of this task can not fall into more 

competent hands.

travel. Being of good presence — standing- more than 6 feet in height, 
well educated, and an accomplished musician — he easily procured 
admission into the best of society, married an Ameri- 
can girl, and established himself at Duanesburg, in 
New York, but was, apparently, never naturalized. 
He appears to have taken an active interest in agricultural, scientific, 
and political affairs, and, in company with 
Stephen Van Rensselaer, became one of the 
directors of the railroad from Albany to 
Schenectady, a charter for which was 
granted in 1826. The death of his wife and 
two daughters, however, caused him to leave 
Duanesburg and turn his thoughts toward 
exploration and science. He therefore re- 
moved to Philadelphia, where he established, 
in 1831, the journal above mentioned. 

In 1831, and again in 1835, he was ap- 
pointed a Government geologist, but his 
work was extremely superficial and of only 
historical interest. Concerning his work in 
the elevated country lying between the Mis- 
souri and Red rivers — the Ozark region — and his subsequent work in 
the upper Mississippi region, Whitney, after numerous quotations, 
remarks: a 

From the above it will be seen that this so-called geological reconnaissance was 
about as worthless rubbish as could well be put together, neither correctly describing 
any facts which came under their author's observation, nor giving any theoretical 
views worthy a moment's notice, except from their absurdity. 

The year 1831 seems, on the whole, to have been singularly une- 
ventful in geological history, but few papers of importance appearing, 
although undoubtedly a large amount of hard, preliminary work was 

being done. 

Perhaps the most important event of the year was 

the establishment of the State geological survey of 
Tennessee, with Gerard Troost, then professor of geology and chem- 
istry in the University of Nashville, but formerly of Philadelphia, at 
its head. This survey continued in existence until 1815, during which 
time eight annual reports were made, the first two of which were not 
published. The third report, made in October, 1835, comprised but 
32 octavo pages and dealt particularly with the extent of the coal 
formations and investigations of the soil, marls, and iron ores. It was 
accompanied by a geological map, in which the coal area, colored in pink, 
was indicated as extending in a gradually narrowing belt from the north- 
east to the southwest in the region lying west of the Tennessee River.

Tennessee, 1831-35.

304 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Troost's fourth report appeared in ls:;7, in form of :i pamphlet of 
37 pages. Of these the first 2<> were given up to a general exposition 
of geology, as he understood it. This was followed by a description of 
that part of the State lying south of the Hiwassee 
Report s /837 rth River and east of the Tennessee, and known as the Ocoee 
district. A map of this district and a colored geolog- 
ical section were given, the latter extending in a general northeast 
to southwest direction from the Tennessee River to a point near 
Nicajack. The entire area to the point of the intersection of the Chatta- 
nooga Creek was colored as occupied by "grauwacke," with outcrops 
of primordial limestone coming to the surface near Coqua Creek. The 
region to the west of Chattanooga Creek was represented as underlaid 
by mountain limestone, with the Coal Measures forming Lookout 
Mountain and Raccoon Mountain. These Carboniferous rocks, it 
should be noted, were indicated as unconformable with all other rocks 
of the region. 

The iifth annual report was made November, 1839, and comprised 
all told 75 pages, including an appendix. This was accompanied by 
a colored geological map of the State, the first which had thus far 
appeared, and also a colored section across the entire 
An n ua'i S Report. State from Roane Mountain, in Carter County, to 

Randolph, on the Mississippi. On this map the Roane 
Mountain rock was colored as primordial, mostly granite. An area 
from and including the Smoky Mountains to a point a little Avest of 
Kingston, on the Clinch River, was colored as transition, composed 
of graywacke, slate, limestone, and sandstone, all alternating with each 
other, and in strata highly inclined and dipping toward the southeast. 
From the last-named point to the Tennessee River the country was 
stated to be underlaid by mountain limestone horizontally stratified, 
upon which rested the Cumberland Mountains, composed of Coal- 
Measure rocks, mostly horizontally stratified, and the Buffalo and 
Harpeth hills, just east of the Tennessee River, which were put down 
as formed of siliceous strata, assuming sometimes an earthy appear- 
ance, sometimes that of chert, and horizontally stratified. 

The region west of the Tennessee was given as mostly occupied by 
secondary strata composed of Cretaceous marl, greensand, and clay, 
horizontally stratified. 

It should be noted that Troost, while seemingly recognizing the 
importance of the fossils carried by the rocks of various ages, did not 
attempt to utilize them systematically as means of correlation. On 
page IS, however, he w T rote: 

The lowest pari of the stratum, where it is near the encrinital limestone, often 
contains members of Encrinites, anil other fossils of thai stratum, and arc invariably 
<>f a calcareous nature. This shows that the formation of those siliceous strata is 
more or less contemporaneous with the encrinital strata.

it related to the Trilobites. at least, is shown by Dr. Jacob Green's 
Monograph of the Trilobites of North America, a duodecimo volume of 
93 pages and one plate of ten figures. Thirty-three 
species were described. In a supplement bearing date 
of 1835 this number was increased to forty. A series 
of casts, examples of which are still to be 
found in many of our educational institu- 
tions, accompanied the original publication. 

The true nature of the TriloMte was at that 
time not well understood. Green himself 
seems at first inclined to agree with Latreille, 
who, owing to their supposed footless con- 
dition, placed them intermediate between 
the Chitons and the Articulates." Brong- 
niart, Dekay, and others, it will be remem- 
bered, considered them as belonging to the 
Entomostraca. 

A contemplated chapter on this branch of 
the subject remained unwritten, since the au- 
thor felt that all matters of dispute were " put 

to rest by the late discovery of some living trilobites in the southern 
seas." Concerning the exact position in the zoological scale of these 
"living" forms there still exists some doubt. Dr. James Eights, who 
originally described them under the name of Spseroma bwnastiformis, 
seems to have regarded them as Isopods. Emmons, in his Geology of 
the Second District of New York, on the other hand, referred to them 
as Trilobites, while Zittel, in the latest edition of his Handbook on 
Paleontology, refers them once more to the Isopods. 

Green's ideas as to the value of fossils as indices of geological age 
were not as advanced as those of most of his colleagues or as his time 
would lead one to expect. After quoting some of the prevalent opin- 
ions, he adds in a footnote: 

Nothing can be more opposed to true science than to pronounce on priority of 
formation or the comparative age of rocks from either their structure or the organic 
remains they present. 

Concerning Brongniart's expressed opinion relative to the prepon- 
derating value of fossil over lithological criteria, he wrote: 

This seems to us to imply an admission that nothing definite fan be inferred from 
the nature of the rocks; moreover, that between the nature of the rock and the organic 
remains there may be a palpal de discrepancy. * * The event has proved, from 

what we have already mentioned, that no evidence as to priority can be obtained 
from the nature of the fossil remains displayed in particular strata. 



"The Trilobites have since been shown to have feet.

And this from a paleontologist! 

Although the geological map referred to on page 219 was the most 

important of Maclure's works and the one upon which his fame as a 

geologist largely rests, there are at least two papers of later date that 

are worthy of consideration. The first of these bears 

the west indies, the title Observations on the Geology of the West 

1832 

India Islands from Barbados to Santa Cruz, Inclu- 
sive. This was printed for the author in pamphlet form in 1832, 
while he was at New Harmony, Indiana. The mineralogical nature of 
the materials composing the islands was noted as well as many of the 
structural features. He thought to divide the islands into two distinct 
classes on geological grounds, the first, or most eastern, comprising 
the islands of Barbados, Marie Galante, Grande Terre in Guadeloupe, 
Desirade, Antigua, St. Bartholomew, St. Martin, Anguilla, and Santa 
Cruz. These he found composed mainly of shell-limestone or madre- 
pore rock belonging to the transition class, though sometimes capped 
by secondaiy rocks. The second class, including the Grenadines, St. 
Vincent, St. Lucien, Martinique, Dominica, Basse Terre in Guade- 
loupe, Montserrat, Nevis, St. Christopher, St. Eustatia, and Saba, 
were more or less volcanic and regarded as probably thrown up from 
the bed of the ocean. Such an origin he felt to be proven by their 
containing intermingled masses of volcanic rock and coral or madre- 
pore limestone. The idea that volcanic activit}' was dependent upon 
combustion, as the word is commonly used, still prevailed with him, 
and from the fact that the line of islands corresponded closely with 
the strike of the rocks composing them he thought that the seat of 
combustion probably existed in some stratified substance running par- 
allel to the general stratification of the surrounding rocks. Further, 
since he found on the islands soufrieres which deposited sulphur as 
well as formed alum rock, he concluded that sulphur was one of the 
combustible ingredients. 

Maclure's second paper referred to, An Essay on the Formation of 
Rocks, or an Inquiry into the probable Origin of their Present Form 
and Structure, appeared in 1838. In this the rocks were divided 

into three classes: First. The Neptunian, including 

Maclure on the . , . . * 3 "■ 

Formation of Rocks, those plainly ot aqueous origin. Second, the volcanic - 
and third, those of doubtful origin, under which head 

he would place gneiss, mica, and clay slate, primitive limestone, sye 

nite, granite, greenstone, etc. 

In 1832 the melancholy Conrad began the publication of his work 
on the fossil shells of the Tertiary formations of North 

Conrad's Tertiary of . . 

North America, " America. This marks, according to Dr. G. D. Harris, 

1 832 

"the beginning of systematic research into this part 
of our continent's history." 

The work was published in parts and in small editions, largely at 
Conrad's own expense, the numerous plates of illustrations being pre-

pared, even to the drawing- on stone, by himself. Nos. 1 and 2 appeared 
in 1832, and Nos. 3 and 1 in 1833. These editions early became ex- 
hausted, and in L893 a new edition was prepared through the instru- 
mentality of Doctor Harris. It will be well to mention here that a 
second edition of his Medial Tertiary fossils was brought out this 
same year by Dr. W. H. Pall, working in conjunction with the Wag- 
ner Free Institute of Philadelphia. 

The work of 1832-33 contained little of a strictly geological nature, 
being mainly devoted to a description of the various fossil inverte- 
brates belonging to the Tertiary formations. Conrad divided the 
Tertiary, in conformity with the English custom, into an Upper Marine 
formation, a Middle Tertiary formation, and a Lower Tertiary for 
mation, and gave the geographic extensions of each so far as they are 
known. 

In 1830 the legislature of Massachusetts passed a resolve authorize 

ing the appointment of a surveyor to make a general surve} r of the 

Commonwealth, and on the fifth of June following, on the recommen. 

dation of Governor Lincoln, further authorized the

connection with this survey, a geological examination 
of the region involved. On February 2, 1831, the limits of the geolog- 
ical survey were extended so as to allow tin 1 inclusion in the report of 
a list of the mineralogical, botanical, and zoological productions. 

Prof. Edward Hitchcock, then professor of chemistry and natural 
history in Amherst College, was selected as the "suitable person," and 
presented,, early in 1832, a report of 72 pages, with a colored geolog- 
ical map, on the economic geology of the State. Of this 600 copies 
were ordered printed. In the early part of 1833 reports on the topo- 
graphic geology (37 pages), scientific geology (130 pages), and the cat- 
alogues of animals and plants, with an appendix containing a list of 
the rocks and minerals described (248 pages), were likewise submitted. 

The legislature promptly accepted these reports likewise and ordered 
the printing of 1,200 copies, including a reprint of the report first 
made. Altogether these formed an octavo volume of 692 pages, with 
numerous figures in the text, and a folio volume of 19 plates, includ- 
ing a colored map. The publication of this report marks an epoch in 
American geological work, since it brought to a successful conclusion 
the first survey of an entire State at public expense/' It is true that 
spasmodic beginnings had been made in North and South Carolina, 
but such were so lacking in breadth of conception and failed so utterly 
in execution that it is only by courtes\ r that they can be considered as 
geological surve} T s at all. Under these conditions a detailed review of 
the contents of the reports will not be out of place here. 



«The total expense to the State of the three years' work, exclusive of cost of 
printing, was $2,030. 



308 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

In the consideration of the application of Beaumont's theory of 
mountains to those of Massachusetts, Hitchcock thought to tind six- 
systems of strata and contemporaneous uplift in the State. These six 
systems as enumerated are: (1) The oldest meridional system, (2) the 
trap system, (3) the latest meridional system, (4) the northeast and 
.southwest system, (5) the east and west system, and (6) the northwest 
and southeast system. 

The Hoosac Mountains, considered under his oldest meridional sys- 
tem, he regarded as due to two different epochs of elevation, the last 
taking place after the deposition of the new red sandstone, as was 
.shown by the slight dip (15° to 20°) of the latter, while the slates and 
gneisses of the range stand nearly vertical. The force which gave 
rise to mountain uplift he regarded as gravity acting on the crust as 
the nucleus gradually shrunk away in process of cooling. 

Not the least interesting chapters in Hitchcock's work are those 
relating to the unstratified rocks. Here, under the name of greenstone, 
he included the entire series of basic and intermediate eruptives now 
classed as melaphyrs, diabases, and diorites. Their mineral composi- 
tion was stated, however, as hornblende and feldspar, though the min- 
eral identified as hornblende has been proven by modern microscopic 
methods to have been almost wholly augite. Columnar, compact, 
amygdaloidal, and porphyritic varieties were recognized. 

Concerning the igneous origin of these rocks he professed little 
doubt, and he accounted for their appearance in the form of continuous 
sheets on the assumption that they were poured out, not from craters 
but from linear openings produced by the shrinkage of the earth's 
interior. Thus early was recognized the phenomena of fissure erup- 
tions, as later developed by Geikie and others. 

Commenting on the occurrence of the greenstone in "veins,' 1 as at 
Nahant, he expressed the opinion that the slate in which these veins 
occurred could not have been solid at the time of the intrusion, this 
on account of the size of the fissures, which seemed to him to be too 
wide to have been formed by desiccation. Evidently the possibility 
of the formation of these fissures by dynamic agencies acting on con- 
solidated materials was not then realized. 

Under the name of porphyry he included the compact eruptive rocks 
now classed mainly as aporhyolites or quartz porphyries, such as form 
the cliffs at Marblehead, and are also found in other localities, as Hing- 
ham and Maiden. Their porphyritic structure he thought could 
result only from igneous solution, The base of these porphyries he 
stated to be of compact feldspar, which he regarded as formed by the 
melting down of preexisting feldspathic rocks. 

The slaty structure sometimes shown, and which is now recognized 
as flow structure, he regarded as representing the original structure 
of the slaty rock from which the porphyry was derived by fusion. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY— DECADE OF L830-1839. 309 

This view is interesting when compared with those put forward nearly 
half a century later by one who, working under the misguided T. 
Sterry Hunt, argued in favor of the sedimentary origin of the entire 
series. 

Hitchcock thought it probable that the mica slate and gneisses of 
the Hoosac Range passed laterally into one another, 'owing to a 
decrease in the amount of feldspar in the gneissic rock. Such a 
transition seemed to him as possible, whether the rocks were to be 
regarded as direct crystallizations from aqueous solution or sedi- 
mentaries crystallized through the influence of heat. He himself 
was inclined to the belief that these schists and gneisses were meta- 
morphosed sediments, since he could conceive of no chemical process 
by which such a variety of minerals as those contained by them could 
have crystallized out simultaneously from solution. Such a crystalli- 
zation, he argued, would be differential. 

He utilized this same argument in writing on the origin of the 
granites. These latter he looked upon as resulting from the melting 
down of other rocks, gneisses being duo to the more or less complete 
fusion and crystallization of feldspathic sandstone. The deeper lying 
portions, which were most highly heated, gave rise to granitic gneiss, 
and those further removed gave rise to the porphyritic, lamellar, and 
schistic varieties. It will be of interest to compare these views with 
those advanced by Clarence King nearly forty years later. 

Hitchcock classed under the name of graywacke the siliceous con- 
glomerate of Dorchester and Roxbury (now considered as of Cambrian 
age), and, indeed, every conglomerate sandstone and fragmentary for- 
mation that was older than the red sandstone and coal formation, thus 
avowedly following Humboldt." 

Under a misapprehension regarding the character of the amygdules, 
he included under the name of varioloid wacke the melaphyr of 
Brighton and elsewmere, as well as other altered Paleozoic lavas found 
at Hinghani, Needham, and Saugus; also the siliceous or flinty slates 
of Nahant and jasper of Newport. 

The red sandstones of the Connecticut Valley were rightly set down 
as belonging to the New Red, he having identified the upper portions 
of the bed with the New 7 lied sandstone of Europe through the presence 
of "vertebral" remains found at East Windsor, Connecticut, and Sun- 
derland and other localities in Massachusetts. He still, however, 
thought it not impossible that the lower portion of the beds might cor- 
respond to the Old Red sandstone of Europe. It will be remembered 
that in the American Journal of Science for 1823 he considered these 
upper beds as belonging to the coal formation, on account of the 
included thin seams of bituminous coals. 



"Humboldt's Essay on the Trend of Rocks in the Two Hemispheres appeared in 
1822. 



310 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

The Tertiary formations of the State he divided into two general 
groups, the most recent being made to include 1 the beds of blue plastic 
clay alternating with layers of white siliceous sand, and the second 
division the plastic clays of ( iayhead and Nantucket. 

Naturally the drift so abundantly distributed over the surface was 
attributed to the action of the Noachian deluge. ''That seen about 
Cape Ann can not fail to impress every reasoning mind with the con- 
viction that a deluge of tremendous power must have swept over this 
cape. Nothing but a substratum of syenite could have stood before its 
devastating energy." 

One of the points which must impress the reader who is at all con- 
versant with the work of modern physiographers is the inability of 
Hitchcock, as well as his contemporaries, to understand the relation- 
ship existing between a river and the channel in which it flowed. Dis- 
cussing the course of the Connecticut River, he wrote: "The ordinary 
laws of physical geography seem here to be set at defiance," and " the 
geologist will be surprised to find it crossing the greenstone ridge " at 
its highest part, i. e., through the gorge between Mounts Holyoke 
and Tom. The facts that he deduced from this and other like illustra- 
tions are that "surely the Connecticut River did not excavate its own 
bed, but the gorges through which it and the Deerfield and Westtield 
pass were excavated to a considerable depth before they began to tlow. v 

The student of to-day need scarcely be reminded that the river did 
excavate its own channel and ran in essentially its present position 
before the warping which brought the trap ridge across its course took 
place. 

Hitchcock was not a believer in the doctrine of uniformitarianism; 
indeed, while perhaps not an extreme catastrophist, he combated 
vigorously the views put forth b} 7 Lyell in his Principles," and argued 
for the greater intensity of geological agencies in the earlier periods 
of the earth's history. Some of his reasons for this belief are worthy 
of attention. He believed the continent to have been elevated above 
the ocean, not little by little, but by a few paroxysmal efforts of vol- 
canic force. Since this force, as acting during the past four thousand 
years, seemed too feeble to result in the elevation of a single mountain 
chain, so, he argued, it must have been more energetic in previous 
epochs. 

The fact that the older rocks are more distorted and highly meta- 
morphosed than the younger was also regarded as indicative of the 
greater intensity of the earlier productive agencies. Singularly 
enough, the near-shore origin of beds of conglomerate was not real- 
ized, the occasional occurrence of such among sedimentary rocks 
being regarded as due to the "occasional recurrence of powerful

debacles of water,' 1 the like of which can not be produced by any 
causes now in operation. 
Concerning the origin of valleys there was manifested a great dearth 

of knowledge. * W I am in doubt whether there is more than one valley 
in Massachusetts that is, strictly speaking. : i valley of denudation," 
that being the one lying between Mount Toby and Sugar Loaf. The 
valleys in Berkshire and Worcester and possibly also that of the 
Merrimac River were regarded as primary, more or less modified by 
deluges and other abrading agencies. 

Accompanying this report was a volume of nineteen plates, com- 
prising a colored geological map of the State; nine general and 
special views; four of fossils; a map of the valley of the Connecticut: 
a map showing the direction of the strata; two plates of sections, 
three of which ran in an east and west direction and one in a north 
and south; and one "tabular view" of the rocks and their imbedded 
minerals. 

On the map the rocks were colored as belonging to six groups, as 
below. It will be noted that there is no attempt at other than a litho- 
logical classification until the New Red sandstone and Tertiary are 
reached.

The drawings of fossils and the general views were the work of 
Mrs. Hitchcock. 

In 1837 Doctor Hitchcock was commissioned by Governor Everett 
to make a further geological and mineralogical survey in which 



312 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

economic problems should be of primary importance. His report 
appeared in the form of House Document No. 52, under date of 1838. 
In 1839 the legislature authorized the reprinting of all the reports, 
with such additions and corrections as the author chose to make. This 
reprint appeared in 1841 in the form of two quarto volumes of s:;i 
pages, the first 126 of which are given up to a discussion of the soils, 
their kind, origin, and fertility. 

Hitchcock here followed closely Sir H. Davy. Berzelius, and 8. L. 
Dana, and dwelt particularly upon the problematic geine, a substance 
resulting from vegetable decomposition and supposed to contain all 
the essentials of plant food. This part of the work is of interest as 
containing C. T. Jackson's expressed and well-founded doubt as to the 
existence of such a body, and a long letter from S. L. Dana attempt- 
ing to prove the chemical unity of the compound. Some twenty pages 
were devoted to fossil fuels, with especial reference to the anthracite 
of Worcester, Massachusetts, and of Rhode Island, and the bituminous 
coal of the New Red sandstone. A list of peat bogs, with reference 
to their possible availability for fuel, was also given. Building stones 
were discussed, and two pages devoted to the subject of rock decay 
and its probable cause. Metallic and nonmetallic ores were described. 

Many of the views expressed in the early reports were repeated here 
with but slight modification. He still adhered to his six distinct 
systems of strata which were tilted at various epochs. The oldest, 
called the meridional system, embraced all the primary rocks lying 
between the valleys of the Connecticut and Worcester. The second, 
or northeast and southwest system, included the gneiss range in the 
southeastern part of Worcester County, the central part of Middle- 
sex, and a part of Essex. The third, or east and west system, 
included the gneiss around New Bedford, the graywacke, and a large 
part of the syenite, porphyry, and greenstone of the State. The 
fourth, or Hoosac Mountain system, embraced all the rocks between 
the Connecticut and Hudson rivers, except the trap and New Red 
sandstone. The fifth included the New Red sandstone, and the sixth, 
or northwest and southeast system of rocks, mainly gneiss occurring 
in the southern part of the State bordering upon Rhode Island. In 
the geological map which accompanied this report he employed but 
six colors, which marked off the rocks of the State into six distinct 
groups, the members of each of which, with the exception of the 
fourth, were so nearly related that he thought they might be regarded 
as belonging to the same formation. In his first group he placed the 
granite, syenite, greenstone, and porphyry; in the second, gneiss and 
the associated hornblende slate and quartz rock; in the third, mica 
slate, with the associated quartz rock and hornblende slate, talcose 
slate, and chlorite slate; in the fourth, limestone, steatite, and serpen- 
tine; in the fifth, metamorphic slates, graywacke, argillaceous slate, 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF L830— 1839. 313 

coal measures, and the New Red sandstone, and in the ^ixth group, 
Eocene Tertiary, diluvium, and alluvium. 

Hitchcock described the Connecticut as flowing through a synclinal 
valley, a valley which became nearly filled by the red sandstone deposit. 
This last, he thought, had since been eroded away, so that the valley 
as it now exists may "in some sense" be considered "as a valley of 
denudation." Most of the valleys in Massachusetts he still regarded 
as valleys due "to the elevation and dislocation of the strata." 

He noted that the animal remains found in the older rocks differed 
the most radically from the existing species, and also that the organic 
remains found in northern portions of the globe corresponded more 
nearly to existing tropical species than did those now living in the 
same localities. Further than this, he announced that different species, 
genera, and families of animals began their existence at very different 
epochs in the earth's history, and that the same species rarely extended 
over from one formation into another. Notwithstanding this, though 
giving lists of fossils found in rocks of various horizons, he made' no 
attempt to determine their relative ages by means of them and regarded 
correlation by such aids as impossible. Following Phillips and Lyell 
in many of his statements, he yet announced as a principle that " Rocks 
agreeing in their fossil contents may not have been contemporaneous 
in their deposition," although they might not differ greatly in age. 
'•From all that has been advanced," lie wrote, "it appears that an 
identity of organic remains is not alone sufficient to prove a complete 
chronological identity of the rocks widely separated from each other; 
but it will show an approximate identity as to the period of their 
deposition, and in regard to rocks in a limited district it will show 
complete identity. 1 ' Where both the mineral nature and the character 
of fossils were identical, identity or synchronism would be much more 
probable, but a want of such agreement, so far as it related to mineral 
character, was not regarded as fatal to the idea of synchronism. 

He argued against the idea that the stratified primary rocks are 
merely the detrital or fossiliferous rocks altered by heat, but regarded 
them rather as products of both mechanical and chemical action by 
aqueous and igneous agencies when the temperature of the crust was 
very high and before organic beings could live upon it. 

He noted that the dolomitic rocks seemed genetically related to the 
limestones, but his ideas as to the methods by which the changes had 
been brought about were naturally somewhat crude when considered 
in the light of to-day. From a study of the field relations of the dolo- 
mites of Berkshire County and other localities he came to the conclu- 
sion "that all the cases of dolomitization in Massachusetts occur either 
in the vicinity of a fault, or of unstratiried rocks, or in the midst of 
gneiss, where the evidences of the powerful action of heat in the 
induration of the limestone and the obliteration of its stratification is 



314 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



as great as results from the presence of unstratitied rocks." The 
actual dolomitization he thought to have been "probably produced by 
gaseous sublimations, chiefly of carbonate of magnesia, which pene- 
trated the rock after it had been softened by heat so as to be perme- 
able/' In some instances, however, he thought it highly probable that 
magnesian limestone had been deposited directly from thermal waters. 
In seeking an explanation of the fact that in passing from the top 
of Hoosac Mountain toward the Hudson River one continually meets 
newer and newer rocks which always appear to pass under the older — 
in other words, that there is inversion of the strata — he came to the 
conclusion, put forward with some hesitation, ""that these rocks have 
actually been thrown over into an inverted position, or rather, have 
been so contorted by a force acting laterally that one or more folded 
axes have been produced." 

The same feature had been mentioned in his report for 1835, but 

then appeared "too im- 
probable to be admitted." 
His views on the subject 
were illustrated by a 
sketch, copied in fig. 22; 
the portion above the 
heavy continuous black 
line being conceived to 
have been removed by 
erosion. Later this ob- 
servation was claimed to 
be the first recognition 
of the true character of 
overturned folds. This 
was, however, disputed by H. D. Rogers, who claimed to have made and 
published similar observations during the progress of the New Jersey 
survey in 1838-39. 

Below is the paragraph upon which the claim of Rogers was appar- 
ently based. The statement is made in the course of a description of 
the various axes of elevation that have given rise to the more promi- 
nent physical features of northern New Jersey. 

The movement which elevated Jenny Jump, seems to have heen everywhere one 
of excessive suddenness and violence, as the strata along its anticlinal axis are not 
only frequently much dislocated and broken, but those lying immediately along its 
northwestern base are in several places thrown into an inverted posture, dipping not 
to the northwest, but in toward the base of the hill. & 

«This is probably a reflection of views earlier put forward by Von Buch with ref- 
erence to the dolomites of the Tyrol.

Fig. 22.— Folded axes. (After E. Hitchcock.) 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1830-1839. 315 

The idea was, however, brought out much more clearly in a com- 
munication made by him before the Association of American Geol- 
ogists and Naturalists in 1841, an abstract of which was given in their 
Proceedings and in the American Journal of Science for the same 
year. He then called attention to the "inverted dip' 1 observable 
among the rocks of the Coal Measures (of Pennsylvania) and ascribed 
the same to a great force acting laterally, folding and crushing the axis 
so as to produce this inverted dip by tossing the strata many degrees 
beyond the perpendicular, thus producing the present apparent dip of 
the lower stratified or sedimentary rocks beneath the primary. 

In view of the observations made by Eaton in 1820, Steel, in 1825, 
and W. B. Rogers, in Virginia, in 1838, as noted elsewhere, the sub- 
ject of priority between the two first named is scarcely worth discussing. 

Heavy demands have from a very early time been made upon elec- 
tric currents to account for all sorts of geological phenomena, from 
the formation of ore deposits to the production of slaty cleavage, or 
even the uplifting of mountain ranges. It is not strange, therefore, 
that Doctor Hitchcock should have felt justified in making slight 
draft upon it to help him over some of his minor difficulties. The 
peculiar imitative and otherwise interesting forms assumed by the 
ferruginous concretions found in the Connecticut Valley demanded an 
explanation. "I know of no agent," he wrote, . u that could have 
accomplished this (i. e., the separation of the iron from the menstruum 
which held it in solution) except galvanic electricity," and again, "I 
strongly suspect galvanism to have been a chief agent in concretions 
of every sort/ 1 

In the report of 1833, and again in those of 1835 and 1841, Hitch- 
cock called attention to the peculiarly flattened and otherwise distorted 
pebbles in the conglomerate at what is locally known as Purgatory, 
near Newport, Rhode Island. His description is important in view of 
his subsequent writings and the discussions which arose in connection 
therewith. The subject may, however, well go over until his later 
paper of 1861 (see p. 510). 

This final report, coming at the time it did, naturally attracted much 
attention and favorable comment. From a brief preliminary review in 
the American Journal of Science the following paragraph is selected: 

If we reflect that the vast mass of facts and information of various descriptions, 
and the reasonings and inferences contained in these columns, are all the result of 
untiring, nay, almost Herculean, efforts of an individual mind, continued among the

encouraged to hope that we may yet see the day when the united efforts of our small 
army of working geologists now laboring in the common cause shall reduce the whole 
of our widespread territory to an intelligible perfect system.

now dealing will scarcely permit us to overlook the explorations of 
Jean N. Nicollet throughout the Middle West. 

Nicollet was born in Fiance in 1790 and came to 
sketch of America in 1832 from purely financial considerations,

having" involved not merely his own fortune but those 

of friends in unfortunate speculations. His main scientific work 

up to this date had been of an astronomical nature, and it is perhaps 

natural that his attention in a new country should have 

work in turned toward exploration and map making. 

From 1833 to 1838 he was engaged, with the coop- 
eration of the War Department, though without financial assistance, 
in mapping the region of the upper Mississippi. From 1838 to 1841 
he was in the employ of the Government, completing the surveys 
and maps thus begun. Other work of like nature was projected, but 
before plans were matured his health gave way and he died in 1843. 
His geological work, under the conditions mentioned above, was 
therefore of comparatively slight importance, excepting as calling 
attention to regions as } T et but little explored. 

He claimed to have traced the Cliff limestone of Owen over a vast 
extent of country in the Mississippi Valley, and connecting his own 
work with that of Owen, Locke, H. King, and others, felt justified in 
assigning the Falls of St. Anthony as the northern limit of the forma- 
tion. In this he was correct. He added to the knowledge of the 
geology of the region of the Sioux and Missouri rivers by bringing 
in important Cretaceous fossils, both vertebrate and invertebrate in 
their nature; described the occurrence of the Indian pipestone (Cat- 
linite) of the Coteau des Prairies of Minnesota, and correctly described 
the pseudovolcanoes and their pumice-like product as due to burning 
lignite beds. 

The second American edition of Bakewell's Geology, from the 

fourth London edition, was printed, as was the first, in New Haven 

and under Silliman's supervision. The work needs notice here, as it 

shows Silliman's gradually expanding views and dis-

still floundering in the deep waters of the JNoachian 
deluge. Of particular interest are his remarks on the nature of geo- 
logical evidence and its consistency with sacred history. 

Silliman took the ground that there was no reason to believe that 
any part of the crust of the earth is now in the same condition as first 
created, every portion having been worked over in accordance with 
physical laws which are as much the Creator's work as are the mate- 
rials upon which they operate. Unlike some of his predecessors and 
contemporaries, he did not, however, at this time feel it incumbent 
upon him to close his eyes to, or even to distort, any evidence that 
might present itself in order that it might not conflict with the state-

merit of sacred history. "Any attempt to disprove the truth or gen- 
uineness of the Pentateuch, and Genesis in particular, is wholly 
superfluous, and quite aside from any question that can in this age 
be at issue between geologists." "No geologist at the present day 
erects any system upon the basis of the scripture history/* But 
admitting that the Mosaic history is genuine and true, he felt that 
one might with historical and philosophical propriety compare geology 
with history and regard historical coincidence with observed phe- 
nomena as interesting, "because they are mutually adjuvant and con- 
firmatory. 1 ' As with other workers, including even some of the 
present time, he found most that is confirmatory in a study of the 
drift or "diluvial," which was naturally ascribed to torrential action, 
and perhaps concomitant with the universal deluge recorded in Gen- 
esis. After a somewhat prolonged discussion of the meaning of the 
term "days,' 1 as used in Genesis, he gave the following:

Perhaps that part of Professor Silliman's work which showed the 
keenest insight into geological problems is that relating to the subject 
of crystallization in rocks. The proximate causes of the phenomenon 
were recognized as heat and solution. 

There is no doubt that fire and w T ater * * * have operated in all ages in pro- 
ducing mineral crystallization. Of these, however, fire appears to have been by far 
the most active, * * * and there is every reason to admit that even granite has 
been melted in the bowels of the earth, and therefore may crystallize from a state of 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY — DECADE OF 1830-1839. 319 

igneous fusion. If this be true of the proper crystals of granite it may be also true 
of the imbedded crystals which it contains, and therefore of all other crystals. 
Those which contain much water of crystallization may present a serious difficulty, 
but perhaps pressure may have retained the water, and as the parts of the mineral 
concreted in cooling the molecules of water may have taken their place in the regular 
solid. Still we can see no reason for excluding water and other dissolving agents, 
acting with intense energy under vast pressure and at the heat of even high ignition, 
from playing a very important part in crystallization. (Pp. 433-434.) 

This, it will be observed, is essentially the aqueo-igneous theoiy of 
eruptive rocks, and could scarcely be improved on to-day. In this 
connection it is well to remember that Edward Hitchcock, in his 
Geolog}^ of Massachusetts, 1833 (see p. 309), inferred the igneous origin 
of granite from its ciystalline structure, " since substances held in 
solution always crystallize in succession, while in granite we have a 
solid crystalline mass of three or four distinct substances which evi- 
dently crystallized contemporaneously." 

The tendenc}^ to generalize on insufficient data is evidently inherent 
in the human race, and it was to be expected that it should early make 
its appearance in so promising a Held for speculation as geology. It 
Eaton's Notions was therefore not surprising that Eaton, after his 
Rocky d Moun h tlins, many years of study in the eastern United States, 
,834- should have ventured opinions concerning the little- 

known West. Basing his statements on observations made by a Mr. 
John Ball, at one time a student of his, he wrote in 1834: 

The geology of the country west of the Rocky Mountains is remarkably simple and 
uniform. The general underlying rock is the red sandstone, which some English 
geologists call Saliferotis rock, and which characterizes the red sandstone group of 
De La Beche. It is the same which contains the salt springs of the western part of 
the State of New York, and which underlies the basaltic rocks (greenstone trap) of 
Connecticut and Hudson rivers. * * * Wherefore the geology of the east and 
west sides of the Rocky Mountains is remarkably alike. Mr. Ball says the Rocky 
Mountains rises up from the midst, as it were, of a horizontal sea of red sandstone, 
as if some tremendous force had driven it upward, like an island forced up from the 
depths of the ocean. * * * Mr. Ball considers almost the whole country as vol- 
canic * * * near the west side of the Rocky Mountains. * * * Mr. Ball 
found first graywacke and sparry lime rock. But he soon entered upon the red 
sandstone region, which continues as the basis rock to the Pacific. * * * The 
country is often very mountainous along the route to the Pacific, but the mountains 
are red sandstone, grey pudding stone, or basalt. Such is the simplicity and uni- 
formity of the geology of the vast region west of the Rocky Mountains that it can all 
be told in one sentence of six lines. 

It may be well to add that Mr. Ball himself took exception to some 
of the conclusions drawn by Professor Eaton, and later published in 
the same journal his own views on the subject. These may, however, 
be passed over here without comment.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



The two most important original contributions of the year 1833 were 
Hitchcock's Massachusetts, already noted, and Isaac Lea's Contribu- 
tions to Geology, the latter dealing - with the Tertiary of Alabama, 
Maryland, and New Jersey. In Lea's work there were 
^o e alo?oTy!' i i b 8 U 3 t 3 0nS brought prominently forward for the first time, by an 
American writer, the striking changes that had taken 
place in tin 1 introduction of the Tertiary fauna and the close relation- 
ship existing between that fauna and the fauna of the present day. 

Out of some two hundred and fifty species 
of invertebrates found by Doctor Lea in 
tin 1 bluffs at Claiborne, Alabama, two hun- 
dred and nineteen were not referable to any 
known species, i. e., were not found in any 
of the beds older than Tertiary and were 
new to science. It was in this work also 
that the undoubted presence in America 
of beds referable to the Eocene of Lyell 
was recognized, although the character of 
the fossils and the general position of the 
beds had been already noted b} 7 Conrad 
(p. 307)." 

The last named, the year following, marked 
out the distribution of the Eocene in Mary- 
land and noted the occurrence of Pliocene fossils overlying it at Vance's 
ferry on the Santee River. The Fort Washington beds, formerly 
regarded bv him as Eocene, he now suggested to be

contemporaneous with the Miocene of Europe. 
In 1834 there was organized the Geological Society of Pennsylvania. 
According to its constitution: 

The objects of the society are declared to be to ascertain as far as possible the 
nature and structure of the rock formations of the State; their connection or corn- 
_ . „. parison with the other formations in the United States and of the 

Organization of the r 

Geological Society of rest of the world; the fossils they contain, their nature, positions, 

ennsy vama, . & ^ associations, and particularly the uses to which they can be 

applied in the arts, and their subserviency to the comforts and conveniences of man. 

This society continued in existence but four years, but served its 
apparent purpose in bringing about the establishment, in 1836, of the 
State geological survey with H. D. Rogers at its head. A single

"This publication of Lea's led to a misunderstanding with Conrad, or rather with 
Conrad's friends, Say and Morton, who felt that Doctor Lea was invading Conrad's 
rights. Doctor Lea, however, worked only on material he had received from Judge 
Tait, prior to Conrad's entry upon the field. (Sec I hill's Determination of Dates of 
Publication of Conrad's Fossils of the Tertiary Formations. Bulletin of the Philo- 
sophical Society of Washington, XII, 1893, pp. 215-240.)

volume, in two parts, of "Transactions," numbering upward of 400 
pages, tells the story of its brief existence. This contains papers by 
authors now for the most part little known. R. C. Taylor wrote on 
fucoids and the coal fields of Pennsylvania ^md Virginia, his papers 
being accompanied by numerous sections; James Dickson had an 
Essay on the Gold Region of the United States, all comprised within 
the limits of 16 pages; Jacob Green had a paper on a Sulphated 
Ferruginous Earth, and a Description of a New Trilobite from Nova 
Scotia. Others were by Richard Harlan, Gerard Troost, Thomas 
Clemsen, and H. Koehler. Few of the writers or active members 
achieved other reputation than that given by the single publication, 
though Taylor became an authority on coal, while Harlan and Troost 
became later widely known, the one as a vertebrate paleontologist and 
the other as a geologist. This society, it is well to note, was the 
second .geological societ} 7 to be organized in America, the first being 
that at New Haven in 1819. 

A brief paper by William Aiken, professor of natural philosophy 
and chemistry in Mount St. Mary's College, Maryland, published in 
the American Journal of Science at this time, is worthy of some con- 
sideration as bearing upon the prevailing theories 

William Aiken's ...... . , f 

ideas on Mountain regarding mountain uplift and incidental phenomena. 

Uplift, 1834. Ti • » -i i ■ i 

Professor Aiken wrote on the geology of the country 
between Baltimore and the Ohio River, and gave a section showing 
the inclination and kinds of rocks. 

The classification conformed with that prevailing at the time, the 
rocks being divided into (1) a primitive series in the immediate vicinity 
of Baltimore, (2) the transition slates, sandstones, and conglomerates 
of the adjacent county, and (3) the lower secondary rocks of the West. 

Noting the reversal of the dip existing between Hancock and Cum- 
berland, he wrote: " Beneath this space, then, we are authorized, in 
concluding, the eruptive power that was instrumental in upheaving the 
Appalachian chain was most energetically exerted. This may lie con- 
sidered the true anticlinal region. 1 '' He regarded the agent so efficient 
in throwing up mountain chains as igneous, ''an opinion that gains 
confirmation, if any is needed, from the occurrence of thermal waters 
along the center line of the Allegheny region." It is apparent from 
this that he agreed with Daubeny and other European geologists as to 
the volcanic origin of these springs. Roger's paper, ascribing them to 
the other causes, did not appear until eight years later (see page 87:2.) 

In accordance with a resolution passed by the general assembly of 
Maryland, February 25, 1834, J. T. Ducatel, geologist, 

Ducateland ' ,..,'. . 

Alexander's survey and J. H. Alexander, a civil engineer, were appointed 

of Maryland, 1834. . f c .i cm. 

to make a geological survey and new map of the .State. 
This survey continued in existence until L840', during which time 
three annual reports, one on the outlines and physical geography of 

nat mcs 1904 21 



32!2 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Maryland, one on the new map of Maryland, and one on the Frostburg 
coal formation, were issued, the latter, however, not being an official 
publication. 

The geological reports were given up largely to a discussion of 
economic matters, such as the character of the soil and the occurrence 
of coal and ores of the metals. In the report for 1833 the occurrence 
of fossiliferons deposits in Prince George County; at Maryland Point, 
in Charles County; and on St. Mary's River, in St. Mary\s County; also 
at Fort Washington on the Potomac, were noted, but none of the fos- 
sils were identified nor any suggestion made as to their probable 
geological age, although that portion of Maryland was later referred 
to as being occupied by Tertiary rocks. The rocks comprising the 
upper part of Cecil County, the greater portion of Baltimore and Har- 
ford counties, the upper districts of Anne Arundel County, and the 
whole of Montgomery County, were thought to be generally metal- 
liferous and were grouped as primary or primitive. The serpentinous 
rocks were looked upon as of importance, as likely to furnish the basis 
for the manufacture of epsom salts, a not uncommon opinion at that 
time. On the map prepared under the direction of Mr. Alexander the 
lithological nature of the underlying rocks and the character of the 
soil were indicated by names, no attempt being made at coloring. 

In 1835 Ducatel visited the Eastern Shore of Maryland and in his 
report for that year gave a very full account of the geography and 
agricultural condition of Dorchester, Somerset, and Worcester counties. 
He announced the presence there of considerable deposits of greensand 
marl, which he believed would be of great value to the agriculturist. 
In 1836 he completed the geological survey of Calvert County and 
made extensive examinations in Anne Arundel, Prince George, Charles, 
and St. Mary's counties, where he found further deposits of marl. In 
this same year he examined the coal and iron deposits of Allegany 
County and published a geological account and section of the beds. 

In his report for 1838 he gave a general account of the mineral re- 
sources of Harford County and outlines of the geology of Harford and 
Baltimore counties, with a short treatise on the subject of lime burning. 

This survey was regarded by Ducatel as being the first attempt to 
connect a topographic and geological survey. 

Ducatel was born in Baltimore, where his father, a Frenchman, 
conducted for many years a prominent pharmaceutical establishment. 
He received his early training at St. Mary's College in Baltimore, 
subsequently studying in Paris. In 1821 he returned 
sketch of Ducatel. to America, and shortly after entered upon a very 
successful career as a teacher of the sciences —chem- 
istry, philosophy, mineralogy, and geology —serving in the Mechanic's 
Institute and the University of Maryland in Baltimore, and St. John's 
College in Annapolis.

In order that be might devote himself more fully to the work of the 
.survey, he severed his eonneetion with the institutions of learning 
about 1838. The move, however, proved an unfortunate one, as the 
survey was shortlived and he was thrown 
back upon his own resources. 

In 1846 he visited, in the capacity of a 
geological expert, the Lake Superior mining 
regions. Through exposure while there he 
contracted a severe illness, which left him 
in an enfeebled condition from which he 
never fully recovered. He died from con- 
gestion of the lungs in 1849. 

Ducatel is represented to us as a man of 
generous traits and of winning character, 
ardent and enterprising. Physically he was 
short in stature, with square shoulders, black 
eyes, dark complexion, and face strongly 
pitted by smallpox. He bent forward and 

walked with a nervous, energetic step, which betokened the ceaseless 
activity of one accustomed to work and think for himself. 

Few publications bear his name, though as a writer for the journals 
of the day he is said to have been quite prolific. I lis principal work 
was a Manual of Toxicology, which, it is stated, was well received. 

In July, 1831, G. W. Featherstonhaugh, who was introduced to the 

reader on page 301, was authorized by Lieut. Col. J. J." Abert, acting 

under instructions of the War Department, to make a geological and 

mineralogical survey of the ''elevated country lying 

known

under the designation of the Ozark Mountains."" 



The 



survey was duly made and a report rendered bearing the date of Feb- 
ruary 17, 1835. This comprised altogether 97 pages, the first 42 of 
which were given up mainly to a discussion of general principles not 
germane to the report at all, but which, as indicating the condition of 
mind of the writer, are worth}- of consideration. He regarded the 
continents and islands as having originated through an expansive sub- 
terranean force, and believed the mineral veins to have been tilled 
from below, rather than from above, as taught by Werner. 

Granite was regarded as an igneous rock, and designated as "ignige- 
nous." Gneiss he recognized as often passing into granite, while some 
of the primary limestones he thought to have possibly "come from 
central parts of the earth, in a state of aqueous solution, and to have 
subsequently received their high crystalline character from being in 
contact with ignigenous rocks in an incandescent, state.""' To the coni- 



" Thia appears to have been the first formal recognition of the science of geology

324 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

monly received opinion, that all coal resulted from vegetable matter, 
he took exception, and thought that some beds "may have been the 
result of outpourings of bituminous matter. 1 '' The wide geographical 
distribution of Carboniferous rocks west of the Appalachians and in the 
Mississippi Valley was noted, and a section given comprising 1,520 
vertical feet of these rocks and overlying snale and millstone grit, at 
Burkesville, Kentucky. 

Passing to the specific part of the work, Featherstonhaugh discussed 
the occurren2e of the lead ore (galena), its distribution in loose 
pieces in the soil, and its relation to the vein material in the solid 
rock, but the fact that this superficial layer was but the detritus from 
the decomposition of the underlying rock does not seem to have been 
realized more than by his predecessors. He remarked, however, that 
the disseminated granules in the limestone, as at Isie La Motte, fur- 
nished to the eye "sufficient proof that the stony and metallic matter 
were deposited at the same time.' 1 an idea not altogether different from 
that held to-da}'. Further on he noted the occurrence of the ore in 
pockets or cavities filled with red clay as pointing "to a projection of 
this metallic or mineral matter from below." 

He described the hematite deposit of Pilot Knob, Missouri, and 
correctly noted the improbability of finding precious metals in Arkan- 
sas in paying quantities. Magnet Cove he regarded as having been 
perhaps "one of those extremely ancient craters that may ha ve pre- 
ceded those of which basalt and lava are the products." 

Although Featherstonhaugh's standing with his fellow-geologists 
does not seem to have been the best, some of his recorded observations 
certainly show a more philosophical mind and greater ability to grasp 
the broader problems of geology than do those of many of his contem- 
poraries. Thus, discussing the muddy character of the Mississippi, 
he suggested that experiments might be conducted to show the amount 
of sediment annually brought down, whereby we might approximately 
assign a chronological period for the origin of the river, the com- 
mencement of the alluvial deposits, and the withdrawal of the ocean. 
This, so far as the present writer is aware, is the first suggestion of 
its kind to be made. 

Commenting on the fact announced by him in 1828 and since con- 
firmed, that, with the exception of the Tertiary and sub Cretaceous 
beds of the coast, no rocks more recent than the coal-bearing series 
had been found in the United States, he suggested that the American 
continent might in reality be older than the European. This also is 
the first suggestion of its kind to be found in our literature. 

The report was accompanied by a colored geological section extend- 
ing from the Atlantic at New Jersey to the Red River in Texas. On 
fids all New Jersey and Delaware as far as Chesapeake Bay were col- 
ored as occupied by superficial sand and sub-Cretaceous beds; Mary-

land to the west of the Potomac mainly by primary granites, gneiss, 
and slate, with a narrow band of transition limestone; Virginia by 
transition limestone overlaid in part by graywacke; Tennessee by 
graywacke overlaid at the Cumberland Mountains by Carboniferous 
limestone; Kentucky. Indiana, and Illinois by Carboniferous limestone; 
Missouri and Arkansas by Carboniferous limestone capped by calcareo- 
siliceous hills, and Arkansas, from a point about midway between 
the Fourche and Arkansas rivers, by graywacke capped by Old Red 
sandstone and occasional Tertiary deposits, with sub-Cretaceous beds 
beginning again at the Caddo River and extending nearly to the Red 
River in Texas, w here they were covered by a ferruginous sandstone. 
It was a reprint of this section in the Transactions of the Geological 
Society of Pennsylvania that Lesley referred to in his Historical Sketch 
of Geological Explorations as "a rambling description and a worth- 
less geological section across the continent from New York to Texas." 
In L835 Featherstonhaugh, again under instructions from Lieutenant- 
Colonel Abert, made a geological reconnaissance of the region lying- 
bet ween the seat of government and the Coteau des Prairies, by way of 
Green Bay and the Wisconsin Territory. His report, issued in 1836, 
formed Senate Document No. 333, comprising 168 pages, with -1 plates 
of sections and diagrams. In this, as in his first, there is a large 
amount of preliminary matter of a very general nature. He noted 
that Washington and Georgetown were underlaid by gneiss, in which 
were perceived evidences of an "extensive anticlinal movement by 
which all the rocks along the entire length of the Potomac,' 1 as high 
up as the great bituminous Held, had been affected, and that the true 
dip of the rocks was often "contradicted by the cleavage." This was 
a by no means unimportant observation. The erosive action of the 
river, as manifested by potholes in the schists at Great Falls, was 
dwelt upon and the Seneca sandstone and Potomac breccia described, 
the former noted as often carrying anthracite and casts of calamites, 
but no suggestion as to the geological age of the beds w r as given. The 
Catoctin Mountains were described as "composed of primary slates, 
sandstones, and quartz having a northeast direction. " Referring to 
the relationship existing between the Potomac breccia and the lime- 
stones, slates, and shales, he wrote: 

We thus have all the proofs that the Atlantic primary chain has come up from 
below through the limestone, triturating and breaking it up into fragments of every 
size, which wen- subsequently transported to the east of the chain by a current from 
the west, and deposited there, intermixed with the decomposed red shale. 

He concluded, therefore, that the Atlantic primary chain was ele- 
vated posterior to the deposition of the limestone, "which may be 
considered the equivalent of the lowest beds of Mr. Murchison's 
Silurian rocks." The unsymmetrical character of the folded sand- 
stones and grits at Wills Creek, in Maryland, he described as affording

evidence "that all the beds had been bent up by sonic action from 
below, and that from some inequality in the action or from some 
external cause the bed on which they lay, together with its associated 
strata, had collapsed toward the center in such a manner that they 
would appear to have been thrown up into a vertical position, if the 
uncurvated part had been concealed." 

In remarking- on the constancy of the phenomena connected with the 
anticlinal arrangement of the whole series of Allegheny ridges, he 
ascribed their origin to an elevatory undulating movement, whereby 
"some parts of the strata were forced up into the anticlinal form, in a 
constant magnetic direction," the intervening distance between each 
axis or ridge being at the same time probably thrown down in a 
ruinous state. As the land arose and the waters retired the ruins 
would gradually be borne away, leaving the valleys as we now find 
them. 

The extensive bituminous coal beds of Maryland and Pennsylvania 
were described, the coal itself considered as due to plant growth in 
situ, and not to drift. 

The presence of Carboniferous limestone about 8 miles from Nava- 
rino, Wisconsin, was noted and also, but erroneously, at the Falls of 
St. Anthony, in Minnesota. The lead-bearing beds of Dubuque, 
Iowa, were also judged, by their fossils, to be Carboniferous. In this, 
also, he was in error. 

In 1835 there was organized under the authority of the legislature 
of New Jersey a State geological survey, of which Prof. H. D. Rogers 
was made chief. The survey continued until 1839, the final report, a 
volume of some 300 pages and a colored geological 
NewJer S s fy,7l35° f m ap, bearing the date 1840, the first annual report 
being issued in 1836. In this final report Rogers 
argued that nearly the whole surface of the region occupied by the 
counties of Middlesex, Monmouth, Burlington, Gloucester, Salem, and 
Cape May was at some former period upon a level with the top of the 
surrounding hills, as shown by the finding of sandstone strata always at 
about the same elevation and in the horizontal position in which it 
was deposited. These hills he regarded as hills of denudation, that is 
to say, as formed by the washing away or laying naked of the strata 
which formed the surface of the region about them; but, looking at 
the matter, as he did, through the eyes of a catastrophJst, he was 
unable to say "from what quarter the mighty rush of waters pro- 
ceeded which swept off so extensive a part of the upper rocks." 

In view of the great difference of opinion which has existed and still 
exists in the minds of geologists regarding the age of the white lime- 
stone near Franklin Furnace, New Jersey, it is not without interest 
to note that Rogers himself regarded it as having been originally the 
blue limestone of the district invaded at some period by mineral v ems

in a highly heated or molten state, whereby was effected a series of 
changes similar to those known to be caused by* injections of trap into 
similar strata. 

In his final report Rogers divided the rock formations of the northern 
division of the State into, first, a group of primary rocks confined to the 
islands and the vieinit} T of Trenton ; second, a group of older secondary 
strata confined to the northwestern portions of Sussex and Warren 
counties, and third, a group of middle secondary strata lying in the 
broad belt of country between the southeastern foot of the Highlands 
and the boundary connecting Trenton and New Brunswick. With 
this third group he also connected the trap rocks of the region. 

The occurrence of graphite in the altered rocks near Sparta, remote 
from igneous dikes, and its nonoccurrence in more than very trivial 
quantities adjacent to the dikes, he looked upon as strongly implying 
that it had been derived '' from the elements of the blue limestone 
itself, which may easily be proved to contain an adequate quantity of 
iron and carbon for the production of this mineral." 

The great thickness throughout which this limestone had undergone 
crystallization, apparently from the heating agency of the dikes which 
traversed it, and the law which he traced in the development of some 
of the minerals, afforded, as he felt, unquestionably strong support to 
the theory that gneiss and other primary strata had once been sedi- 
mentary rocks, converted by an intense and widespread igneous action 
into a universally crystalline state. 

The presence of carbonate of copper diffused throughout the fissures 
of the shales indicated to his mind that a considerable portion of the 
metalliferous material, particularly the carbonate, had entered the 
strata in a gaseous or volatile condition and not in that of igneous 
fusion. The iron and zinc deposits, on the other hand, were ''un- 
equivocally genuine lodes or veins" filled with "matter injected while 
in a fused or molten state 11 and not beds formed contemporaneously 
with the surrounding rock. 

It may be recalled that in 1820 Professor Bakewell visited the Falls 

of Niagara, and on his return to England published in the London 

Magazine a short memoir, in which he endeavored to show that the 

falls were once at Queenstown. In the autumn of 1846

observation that the river at one time probably flowed 
through the ancient gravel-filled valley extending from the Whirlpool 
to St. Davids'. In this subsequent research has shown he was emi- 
nently correct. Nevertheless, his observations at the time were not 
wholly accepted. 

In 1834 a Mr. Fairholme, writing in the London and Edinburgh 
Philosophical Magazine, accepted BakewelTs views as expressed in 



328 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

1 s^}< > and put forward certain of his own relating to the rate of back- 
cutting of the falls. To these views H. D. Rogers, in the American 
Journal of Science for 1835, took serious exception. He believed that 
the channel below the falls had been formed in part as a diluvial val- 
ley and by some far-sweeping currents which denuded the entire sur- 
face of North America and strewed its plains and mountains with 
bowlders, gravel, and soil from the north. "The passage of such a 
body of water over the surface would deeply indent all the exposed 
portions of the land. Rushing in a descent from Lake Erie to Lake 
Ontario, from a higher to a lower plain, and across a slope like that at 
Queenstown, it would inevitably leave a long ravine. 11 Commenting 
on this, Silliman remarked in the same journal that an earthquake 
might possibly be instrumental in producing at once such a crack in 
the strata as would drain the lakes in a few days or hours, and to such 
an agency might be ascribed the channel in question. (See Hall's 
paper, p. 384.) 

Rogers was born in Philadelphia in 1808, being one of four brothers — 
James B., William B., Henry D., and Robert Empie — all of whom rose 
to distinction as geologists or chemists. When not quite twenty-two 
years of age he became professor of chemistry and 
|ogers.° f M " °' natural philosophy in Dickinson College, resigning in 

1831 for the purpose of going to Europe to complete 
his studies. He returned to Philadelphia in 1833, and in the ensuing 
winter delivered courses of lectures on chemistry in the hall of Franklin 
Institute. 

In 1835 he was elected professor of geology and mineralogy in the 
University of Pennsylvania, and was also appointed by the legislature 
in the same year to make a geological survey of the State of New 
Jersey, as already mentioned. In 1836 he was made State geologist 
of Pennsylvania, and it is upon the work done in this connection that 
his fame as a geologist chiefly rests. 

In 1857 he was made regius professor of natural history in the Uni- 
versity of Glasgow, being the first American to thus receive a foreign 
appointment. As was the case with his brother, W. B. Rogers, lie 
was a good lecturer, with quiet, gentlemanly bearing, never failing to 
make a favorable impression upon his audience. 

His work in Pennsylvania showed not merely great administrative 
ability, but also the power of mastering fully the observations of his 
assistants, making therefrom important generalizations. He was 
unquestionably the leading structural geologist of his time. That his 
generalizations and the theories he deduced will Dot in all cases hold 
to-day in noway reflects upon his ability. In judging his work, as, 
indeed, judging that of any of his predecessors and contemporaries, 
one must take into consideration not merely the condition of knowl- 
edge at the time, but also the conditions under which they worked.

AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1830-1839.

J. G. Percival's 
Survey of 
Connecticut, 
1835-1841. 



One of the most unique figures in early American geology was that 
of Dr. -lames G. Percival. This man was horn at Kensington, Con- 
necticut, September 15, 1795, and graduated at Yale College in 1815, 
after which he studied medicine, receiving the degree 
of M. D. in 1820, and entering upon a troubled and, 
to his friends, troublesome career, which terminated 
only with his death in 1856. 

He wrote poems, became editor of a newspaper, was a proof reader 
and assistant to Noah Webster in the preparation of his dictionary, 
and received a Government appointment as surgeon at West Point and 
afterwards with the recruiting service at Boston. But no form of 
practical work seemed suited to his taste, and he gave up position 
after position that he might devote himself to literature. 

Peevish, often morbid and misanthropic to the point of insanity, 
and always complaining, truly such is queer material from which to 
make a geologist. ''Slender of form, of 
narrow chest and with a peculiar stoop, a 
large, fine head, dark eyes, and inclined to 
sharpness of features; a wardrobe consisting 
of little more than a single plain suit — 
brown or gray — which he wore summer and 
winter until it became threadbare. He 
never wore gloves nor blacked his boots." 
Such is the picture held up to our view by 
his contemporaries. 

A geological and mineralogical survey of 
Connecticut being organized in 1835, Per- 
cival was given charge of the geology and 
C. U. Shepard the mineralogy. Shepard's 
report appeared in 1837. It comprised all 

told some 188 pages, but was not accompanied by a map, sections, nor 
by figures of any kind. 

Percival's report was long delayed, making its appearance finally in 
1812. It would seem that the survey, when inaugurated, was expected 
to be but a superficial one, yet Percival was engaged upon it for five 
weary and laborious years, each year rendering his researches more 
minute, until he had collected over eight thousand specimens and 
made record of dips and bearings still more numerous. The legis- 
lators demanded a report, which was not forthcoming, and finally, in 
1841, all appropriations were withheld and an abridged report pub- 
lished, much against Percival's wishes. This volume is beyond ques- 
tion one of the least interesting of any issued by any State. A dry 
mass of lithological details, with little or no discrimination between 
important and unimportant matters — no theories nor generalities. No 
one for a moment will question that Percival had been, as he claimed,

330 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

"laborious and diligent," yet the reader who searches from cover to 
cover for other facts than lithological characteristics, dip, and strike 
will search in vain. The fact that the trappean outbursts were not in 
straight and continuous lines, but curvilinear in form and occupying 
a series of nearly parallel fissures, was practically the only break in 
the monotony of detail. He wrote to a friend: 

I had twice surveyed the whole State on a regular plan of sections from east to 
west, reducing the intervals in the last survey to an average distance of 2 miles, 
thus passing along one side of each of the nearly 5,000 square miles of the 
State. * * * I had examined all objects of geological interest, particularly the 
rocks and their included minerals, with minute attention. I had scarcely passed a 
ledge or point of rock without particular examination. 

Peevish and complaining, Percival evidently could not be made to 
understand why he should not be allowed to go on indefinitely, render- 
ing a report when he himself should be satisfied of its correctness. 
With such a disposition the average country legislator naturally had 
no patience, and the abridged report, a volume of 495 pages, with an 
uncolored map, was finally printed in 1842, as already noted. 

Though written by a poet, it is utterly lacking in imagination, and, 
aside from its dullness, remarkable only from the fact that it is stated 
to have been written largely from memory. The subjects considered, 
in the order given, were: First, the rocks or consolidated formations; 
second, the loose or unconsolidated formations; third, the soils; fourth, 
economic results, and fifth, the physical geography. The rocks were 
all classed under three heads: First, the primary; second, the sec- 
ondary, and third, traps, the distinctions made being on almost purely 
lithological grounds. 

In 1853 Percival was employed by the American Mining Company 
in exploring the lead mines of Illinois and Wisconsin, and in 1854 was 
appointed State geologist of Wisconsin, as noted elsewhere. He died 
in 1856. 

In the American Journal of Science for 1836 S. P. Hildreth, later 
connected with the geological survey of Ohio, published what was, for 
its time, an important paper relative to the bituminous coal deposits of 

Ohio and the general geology of the Ohio Valley. 
woVin oh?o, 1836. Although Hildreth was inclined to indulge in specu- 
lations founded upon scanty data, his paper is, never- 
theless, important for the numerous sections of the coal strata and as 
illustrating the condition of knowledge at that day relative to both 
coal and petroleum. 

Hildreth was one of the first to recognize the enormous amount of 
subaerial erosion that had taken place throughout the region, and that 
the Ohio River had carved out its own channel. He felt, however, that 
in times past the precipitation had been much greater than at present, 
and the abrasion of the surface by rain and torrents much more rapid. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1830-1839. 881 

He thought to recognize in the Muskingum Valley Tertiary and Car- 
boniferous rocks with New Red sandstone on the extreme southern 
border, while on the Clear Fork of the Little Muskingum he noted 
the occurrence of a white limestone which he erroneously assigned to 
the Lias. 

Considerable attention was given to the " muriatif erous " rocks, and 
he noted the outcropping of a 5-foot bed of coal in the vicinity of the 
salt deposit as "•evincing apparent design in Him who laid the foun- 
dations of the earth in the greater abundance of coal in those places 
where it would be the most useful," i. e., in the evaporation of brine 
for making salt. The occurrence of petroleum springs on the Little 
Kanawha he thus describes: 

By opening and loosening with a spade or sharpened stick, the gravel and sand 
* * * the oil rises to the surface of the water, with which the trench is partially 
filled. It is then skimmed off with a tin cup or some other suitable vessel, and put 
up in barrels for sale or domestic uses. In this way from 50 to 100 barrels are col- 
lected in a season, and much more could be gathered 
if demand required. In the adjacent hills is a thin 
lied ef coal * * * but the source whence this 
petroleum flows must be deep in the earth, and the 
material which furnishes, vast in dimensions. The 
process is one of nature's hidden mysteries, carried 
on in her secret laboratory, far beyond the reach, 
and inaccessible to the curiositv of man. 




The occurrence of gas springs he also 
noted, and one in the center of an open 
tract, "given to the public by the liberality 
of Washington." who w " viewed it as an inter- 
esting natural phenomenon which no parsi- 
monious individual ought ever to appropri- 
ate to his own benefit," is described in some Fra.a6.-Bamuei Prescott midreth. 
detail and the same reverential spirit. " There appears to be no dimi- 
nution in the amount of gas from its first discovery to the present 
time. The same Almighty and liberal hand, which furnished the 
perennial fountains with water, having also provided this gaseous 
spring with the means of an exhaustless supply." 

Hildreth\s supposed discovery of the Liassic age of the white lime- 
stone, noted above, was later disputed by John Banister Gibson, 
chief justice of the supreme court of Pennsylvania, who claimed the 
credit for himself. Both were, however, in error, as shown by sub- 
sequent investigation. 

In 1886 there was organized the first geological survey of the State 
of Ohio, and W. W. Mather appointed chief geologist. 

Mather's Geological lr i ,. n 

survey of Ohio. Ihe survey lasted two years, seeming to have fallen 

through on account of local jealousies. Two annual 
reports were issued, of 184 and 286 pages, respectively, both bearing 
date of 1888. 



382 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Matners assistants were 1 the S. P. Rildreth, just mentioned, who 
early resigned on account of ill health; J. P. Kirtland, Dr. John 
Locke, C. Briggs, jr., J. W. Foster, and Charles Whittlesey, the last 
named in charge of topographic work. Mather's own work was 
largely of an economic character, and he showed here as in his later 
work on the New York survey, a lack of discrimination or ability to 
judge of the comparative value of the different subjects with which 
he had to deal. 

Hildreth's report must be read with a certain amount of allowance, 
since his ill health and consequent resignation precluded him from 
making certain possible modifications of his earlier statements. He 
described the occurrence of New Red sandstone, Lias, Oolite, etc., over- 
lying the coal, and dwelt to a considerable extent upon the possible 
value of the buhrstone and also upon the salt springs. 

Locke's report, comprising pages 201-286 in the second annual, was 
by far the most satisfactory, showing a much broader grasp of the 
general subject than that of any of his associates. He described the 
locks below the coal formation as having evidently been deposited in 
the bed of a deep primitive ocean, though he failed to realize, or at 
least ignored, the value of the fossil remains in which the rocks 
abounded, his classification being wholly lithological. As pointed out 
by Orton, moreover, he failed to correlate the members of the series 
which he found with those of the same series elsewhere. 

He noted the immense amount of drift material, and also the 
scratched and grooved surface of the underlying rock, describing it 
as '"planished as if b} r the friction of some heavy body moving over 
it and marked by parallel grooves. 1 "' He regarded such as having 
probably been formed by icebergs floating over the terrace and drag- 
ging gravel and bowlders frozen into their lower surface. In this he 
followed Hitchcock. 

Briggs's reports, comprising some seventy pages of the first and sec- 
ond annuals, contained nothing of more than very local interest. A sec- 
tion was given showing the relative position and thickness of the strata 
in the counties of Wood, Crawford, Athens, Hocking, and Tuscarawas, 
but no attempt was made to refer them to any particular geological 
horizon, nor was the value of fossils recognized at all. In fact, there 
was but the briefest allusion to fossils, excepting as curiosities. This 
seems the more remarkable, in the case of Locke as well, when we con- 
sider that these regions are peculiarly prolific in invertebrate remains 
and the very important role such have since been made to play. 

To Foster was assigned the geology of Muskingum County and parts 
of Licking and Franklin counties. He classified the rocks of the 
various formations of these regions as Alluvium, Tertiary, Coal Meas- 
ures, fine-grained sandstone, shale, and Mountain limestone, and noted 
the presence of remains of a mastodon and acasteroides in the alluvium.

Whittlesey's results consisted of, first, a brief pamphlet of some eight 
pages, relative to the general topography of the State, and second, a 
report of- seventy-one pages, in which he gave geological sections of 
the rocks from Cleveland to the southeast corner of the Western 
Reserve, with miscellaneous notes on the order of the strata and on 
coal, limestone, iron ores, mineral springs, etc. 

The general results of the survey may be summed up as follows: 
The principal formations, as indicated, beginning with the oldest, are 
first, the great limestone deposit (Silurian and Devonian) which was 
erroneously regarded as equivalent to the Mountain or Carboniferous 
limestone of Europe. This was found in Adams County, extending 
thence to the western portion of the State. It was felt by Locke as 
not unreasonable to suppose that the particles composing it were once 
held in aqueous solution and subsequently deposited in tranquil waters 
along the bottom of the ocean. This may then have been consolidated 
by subterranean heat. Overlying this is a bed of shales (Upper Devo- 
nian) two or three hundred feet in thickness, black, tissile, and with a 
fetid odor. Next comes Waverly sandstone, the Series being thus first 
named. Fourth, a conglomerate cropping out on the western border 
of the Coal Measures and varying in thickness from 80 to 100 feet. 
Fifth, a lower coal series, consisting of alternations of sandstone, shales, 
limestone, iron ores, and coals, some 300 feet in thickness. Sixth, 
buhrstone. Seventh, the upper coal series, made up of sandstones, 
shales, coal, iron ores, and limestones. Eighth, the Tertiary deposits, 
under which head he included the prairies or barrens-in the western 
part of the State, and the pebble beds and bowlders of primitive rocks 
so abundant in some parts of the Scioto Valley; and ninth, the recent 
deposits, including as such those now forming along the river beds. 
The beds were noted as having generally but a slight dip and irregular 
undulations. Locke found near the boundary of Ohio and Indiana a 
summit level and an anticlinal axis from which the strata dipped in 
opposite directions, eastwardly in Ohio and westwardly in Indiana. 
This is apparently the first recognition of what has since become known 
as the Cincinnati Uplift. 

Mather was educated at West Point, and from 1829 to L835 was 
assistant professor of chemistry, mineralogy, and geology in the Mili- 
tary Academy. While there he published (1833) a text-book on 

geology, a miniature sixteen-mo. volume of some L39 
sketch of Mather, pages, which seems to have been fairly well received 

at the time and is stated to have passed through sev- 
eral editions." A photographic copy of one of the pages is given 

a He also published in 1834 a 36-page pamphlet entitled a Sketch of the Geology 
and Mineralogy of New London and Windham counties, in Connecticut, the same 
being accompanied by a colored geological map.

AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1830—1839. 335 

Mather resigned his commission in 1830 and gave up his time wholly 
to science. He was for a short time professor of chemistry and 
mineralogy in the University of Louisiana, but in 1836 became con- 
nected with the Ohio State surve} 7 , and afterward with those of New 
York and Kentucky, as mentioned elsewhere. 

He is described as a large and robust man. with great capacity for 
physical and mental labor — a man "equable in his disposition and 
gentle in his manners, considerate of others and just in his judgment 
of them, modest, but manly and self-reliant and thoroughly versed in 
the branches of science to which he devoted himself." 

With a view of directing the attention of the legislature to the 

important subject of a geological and agricultural survey of the State 

of Georgia, the patriotic citizens of Burke and Kich- 

Geor^i,%836. k '" mond counties in 1836, at their own individual expense, 

directed Prof. John R. (Dotting — 

to make a geological and agricultural survey of their respective counties. To 
examine all localities of limestone, marls, and all other minerals useful in agriculture 
and the arts. Also rocks that may be proper for the purpose of architecture, the 
construction of roads, railways, etc. To examine the water of springs and wells 
with regard to the salubrity or insalubrity of the same. To analyze the soils on 
different plantations in the two counties, with a view to their improvement. To 
illustrate the whole by drawings, diagrams, and a chart of the two counties, and 
to present a report of the same to his excellency the governor, in order that it may 
come properly before the two branches of the legislature should he deem the subject 
of sufficient importance. 

In conformity with these instructions Cotting, in the latter part of 
March, began his survey, which was continued for eight months, the 
results appearing in the form of a duodecimo volume of 198 pages, 
unaccompanied by drawings or maps of any kind, since such could not 
be made within the State and the time assigned for publication would 
not permit of the original drawings being sent north. 

The work was divided into three parts: (1) Topography, (2) eco- 
nomic, and (3) scientific geology. The ideas advanced were naturally 
largely a reflection of those held by English and European authorities. 
The formations were divided into Tertiary, Secondary, Transition, and 
Primitive. Granite was recognized as an igneous rock, but it does not 
appear that the fact of its deep-seated origin and subsequent exposure 
by erosion was taken into account. 

Many of these rocks [he wrote] occur not only together, forming a group or series, 
but are ejected in fragments through others and over incumbent strata to the highest 
series, assuming the appearance of having been once in a fused state. Thus frag- 
ments bearing all the features of having been fused or, at least, acted upon by fire or 
intense heat, occur scattered over the surface or imbedded in the strata of the Terti- 
ary and Diluvial of this district, affording a demonstration that this region of country 
lias been subjected to violent internal forces. The granite or syenite exhibits 
marks of some great force acting laterally ami perpendicularly, which has rent the 
mass, heaved it up, and projected some of the fragments to a great distance. 



336 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904 

It is evident here that he considered the bowlder structure incident 
to decomposition as original and due to method of extrusion. 

Some interesting views regarding volcanic agencies are given in 
discussing the possible origin of the buhrstone, a chalcedonic rock 
carrying abundant casts of shells. The material as found occurred 
"only on the upper part of eminences and the edges of inverted 
cones.' 1 '' This he seemed to think offered a sufficient demonstration of 
its igneous origin, and he would account for its uplift on the theory 
of submarine explosions taking place over a large extent of sea bottom 
simultaneously. The vesicular character of the buhrstone he likewise 
regarded as indicative of its volcanic origin. "It is highly probable 
that the fused mass in that state was spread over the bottom of the 
then existing ocean and that these vesicles or holes were the effect of 
water converted into steam by the influence of the heat of the mass." 
Inasmuch as the fusion of silica without the aid of some other con- 
stituent to act as a flux is a phenomenon unknown in nature, such 
views now strike one as somewhat extraordinary. Nevertheless they 
were in accord with their time. 

Although no use was made of fossils in attempting to ascertain the 
relative age of the various rocks, he nevertheless recognized the fact 
that they indicated a sedimentary origin. He wrote: 

Geological investigation has led to the conclusion that there have been a number 
of deluges at different periods or, rather, that the oceanic waters have swept over 
the land, continued for an indefinite period, and then retreated several times, leaving 
their debris behind them. In no other place, perhaps, is the truth of the hypothesis 
1 tetter established than in this region, where fossil remains of different animals char- 
acterize different formations, as it is evident that these fossils must have been formed 
from animals who could not have existed under the earth, but on its surface and at 
the bottom of the then existing sea. 

This well-meant attempt to arouse public interest proved only par- 
tially successful. The legislature of the following winter adopted a 
resolution authorizing the governor to employ a suitable and well 
qualified person to undertake the work and appropriated $10,000 to 
carry it on. Doctor Little was thereupon appointed State geologist, 
but as the legislature of 1840 abolished the office nothing of value was 
accomplished. 

For but the third time in this history we are called upon to step 

be} 7 ond the limits of the United States, and for the second time upon 

the soil of Nova Scotia, a land still later made famous through the 

labors of Logan and the elder Dawson. In 1836 there

volume. The southwestern border was colored as occupied by primary

granites, gneiss, and mica-slate, this being succeeded by a wide belt 
(colored blue) of transition slate, graywacke, and graywacke slate, and 
this, in its turn, by a broad band of sandstone (colored red) extending up 
as far as Westmoreland County, New Brunswick. The broad belt of 
trap rocks along the southwest shore of the Bay of Fundy was colored 
green. Important beds of iron ore were indicated in the transition 
slate and of coal in the red sandstone. These districts were described 
in considerable detail, and attention was called to the fact that the 
different formations corresponded in direction and general character 
with those of the United States. 

Gesner's ideas regarding the uplifting of strata and the causes thereof 
were not at all in advance of his time. Thus writing of the position 
of the slate: 

The strata are variously inclined, and in some cases much twisted and broken; 
but generally they are so placed as to support the opinion that the primary rocks 
under their southern side have been uplifted by some violent and sudden move- 
ment which has thrown the neighboring slate in its present leaning, and often 
perpendicular, position. 

The iron ore of the South Mountains he regarded as of aqueous 
origin, such being demonstrated by the presence of the marine fossil 
shells which it contained. Their presence, however, he was unable to 
explain. 

From whence came these shells, and by what mighty convulsions and changes 
in this globe have their inmates been deprived of life and incarcerated in hard, 
compact, and unyielding rocks? By what momentous and violent catastrophe have 
they been forced from the bottom of the ocean, where they were evidently at some 
former period placed, to the height of several hundred feet above the level of the 
present sea, and even to the tops of the highest mountains? 

And further on: 

It is evident that the slate and ore containing the shells already mentioned were 
once at the bottom of an ancient sea. * * * By some mighty revolution the 
ground occupied by them has been uplifted and their native submarine possessions 
converted into slate, and even iron ore. 

The fact that some of this iron ore is magnetic was regarded by 
Jackson and Alger as due to the presence of trap rock. Gesner, how- 
ever, considered this as not probable, and called attention to the fact 
that the trap rocks are placed in a situation indicating a date much 
later than the New Red sandstone upon which they rest. 

Notwitostanding the crudity of his notions as to the manner in 
which the fossil remains had become entombed, Gesner possessed very 
advanced ideas concerning their value for correlation purposes. This 
is shown in his discussion of the slate range extending from Yarmouth 
to the Gut of Canso. The fossils found therein, he felt, had an exist- 
ence coeval with the original stratification.

They were inhabitants of the same age, enjoyed similar bounties, the same cli- 
mate, and were companions at a period when the waters of the sea were as warm as 
those of the present tropical oceans; a fact easily proved by their organization and 
the beauty and delicacy of their shelly coverings. The corals, coraline sponges, and 
other vegetable productions of that period, although bearing a striking resemblance 
to those now nourishing in submarine situations, have nevertheless some peculiar 
characteristic features, distinguishing them from species of the same classes now 
inhabiting our shores, although their lineal descendants have long since passed away. 

Gesner was an extreme catastrophist, and his ideas concerning the 
origin of the drift, as well as that of coal, were formulated more or less 
by the scriptural account of the flood. Discussing the fragments of 
slate and the masses of quartz rock and granite that were found scat- 
tered over the surface of the Red Sandstone, and even entering into 
its composition at great depth, he argued that their shape demonstrated 
that they had been transported by the efforts of mighty currents. 
From this fact he conceived that similar causes had operated upon the 
surface of the earth at separate and distinct periods of time, one period 
having produced the ingredients of the newer rocks, which in their 
turn had been evidently denuded by the rapidity of overwhelming 
floods. He thought it probable that the first great catastrophe arose 
when the earth emerged from beneath the waters at its first creation, 
before which darkness was upon the face of the deep, and that it was 
not improbable that another geological event may have produced 
another class of phenomena at that period when the "windows of 
heaven were opened and the fountains of the great deep broken up." 

The giant bowlders, sometimes found on the very hilltops, he recog- 
nized as erratics, but could not believe them to be due to flood action. 
""They have doubtless been thrown upwards," he wrote, "and left 
cresting the highest ridges, by volcanic explosions that have taken 
place since the general inundation of our planet." The general phe- 
nomena of the drift, however, he regarded as almost certainly the effect 
"of an overwhelming deluge which at a former period produced those 
results now so manifest upon the earth. Not only hath the granite 
sent its heralds abroad, large blocks of trap are also scattered over 
the soil of Nova Scotia far from their original and former stations." 

That coal is of organic origin he recognized, though as to the man- 
ner of its accumulation he was somewhat in doubt. He assumed that 
a part of it at least ma} r have collected at the bottom of the sea, 
together with successive layers of sand and clay, and that the beds had 
since been uplifted by volcanic forces. The method of conversion of 
the organic matter into coal, he thought, might also have been brought 
about through the intervention of volcanic forces. 

In discussing the changes which have taken place on the surface of 
the earth, he queried if such might not 

have been produced between that period when the globe was first created and the 
Noachian deluge, and might not many of those effects, the causes of which are now

almost inexplicable, have been produced at that momentous period when the "win- 
dows of heaven were opened, and the fountains of the great deep broken up. " * * * 

In no way can these phenomena be so satisfactorily accounted for and explained as 
by admitting the brief account of the creation of the world in the first chapter of 
Genesis; and that there is no necessity for making the world appear older than its 
date given by Moses. 

A.gain: 

The volcanic fires of the earth are gradually becoming extinct. Thev were evi- 
dently far more vehement in former ages than in the present day. Therefore, we 
have sufficient reasons to believe that from the creation of the world to the deluge 
great changes must have taken place upon the earth's surface. Who can clearly 
decide that the flaming sword which forever shut out our first parents from Eden's 
delightful garden was not a livid torrent of flame issuing from the ground polluted 
by sin? 

Concerning the limestones of the coal formation along the Nepan 
River, he wrote: 

On the surface of the limestone the detritus of the deluge forms a distinct cover- 
ing; and, according to the opinion of some geologists, should not be considered in 
any way connected with the changes which have taken place in the strata beneath. 
But we would remark that although the beds of rounded pebbles and sand clearly 
demonstrate the effects of a flood, they can have no reference to the great geological 
catastrophe which ushered in that awful event. The depression of whole continents, 
the raising of the ocean's level bed, the distortion of strata previously horizontal, 
the elevation of mountains, and all those violent operations whereby the whole 
surface of this planet has been rent asunder, might have been the prelude to that 
overwhelming deluge, while the diluvial debris resulted from the action of torrents 
after the crust of the globe had been thus broken up. 

Gesner was born of German-French ancestry in Cornwall is, Nova 
Scotia, and was by profession a physician and surgeon. For a long time 
after obtaining his degree he practiced his profession in the country 

bordering the shores of 
sketch of Gesner. Minas Basin, making his 
visits on horseback, and 
often returning with saddlebags filled with 
specimens collected on the way. In 1838, 
two years after the publication just referred 
to, he was appointed provincial geologist of 
New Brunswick, and removed to St. John, 
where he established the Gesner Museum, 
afterwards purchased by the Natural History 
Society of New Brunswick. This was an 
all-round natural history collection, many 
of the zoological specimens having been 
collected by Gesner himself, who was an 
ardent sportsman. 

After the somewhat premature closing of the survey in L846(?), 
Gesner left St. John and returned to Cornwallis. During his residence 
here he wrote his works on New Brunswick, with notes for emigrants,

and The Industrial Resources of Nova Scotia. Besides his medical 
practice and the scientific and literary work already mentioned, Gesner 
engaged in studies in applied science, particularly in electricity and 
chemistry, and in 1854 took out a patent in the United States for the 
manufacture of kerosene from coal and other bituminous substances. 
About this period he resided in Brooklyn, New York, and was con- 
nected with the company having works on Newton Creek near Perry 
Bridge. In 1861 he published a work on coal, petroleum, and other 
distilled oils. He returned to Halifax in 18H3, where he died the fol- 
lowing year. 

He is represented as a man of medium height, with deep chest and 
square shoulders, black hair and eyes, and a face showing deep thought 
and strong intellectual power. He was unquestionably a man of 
great mental and physical energy. He was noted for his deep piety 
and remained all his life a firm churchman. It is told of him that, 
when connected with Guy's Hospital in London, if troubled by any 
physiological mystery which had become a subject of speculation, he 
always gave as his ultimate conclusion that "God made it so." This 
phrase became known as "Gesner's reason 11 and was so used among 
the students. 

Although C. U. Shepard's work was mainly mineralogical, he occa- 
sionally contributed papers on areal geology. Thus, in the American 
Journal of Science for 1838, we find an article by him 

Shepard on Geology . ^ 

of upper Illinois, on the geology of upper Illinois. In this he described 
the extensive Kankakee swamp region south of Chi- 
cago, and the old beach lines above the present lake level. He also 
discussed the possible overflow of the lake in ancient periods to the 

southward, and dwelt to a considerable 
extent on the possibility of and the com- 
mercial advantages to be derived by uniting 
the waters of Lake Michigan and the Illinois 
River, forming thus a connection with the 
Mississippi. 

The geology of the region was described 
as being exceedingly simple and uniform, 
the great rock formation being the mag- 
nesian limestone. He mentioned the occur- 
rence in this of "Orthocera" and large 
" Pectunculus " and " Terebratula," two 
species of ""Ammonites"' and "'Caryophyl- 
lia," and a k " Favosites." The northern 
boundary of the coal formation he said he 
could not define with precision through lack of opportunity to explore 
it in detail. A geological section of the region between Fox River 
and Spring Creek accompanied the paper.

State Geologist of Virginia. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1830-1839. 841 

On March 6, L835, the general assembly of Virginia authorized the 
appointment of a "suitable person" to make a geological reconnais- 
sance of the State with a view to the general geological features of 
the territory and to the chemical composition of its 

Rogers's Work , , w 

in Virginia, soils, rocks, ores, mineral waters, etc. 1 rot. \\ . B. 

Rogers, then professor of natural history, philosophy, 

and chemistry in William and Mary College, and brother of H. D. 
Rogers, was selected as the suitable person, entering upon his duties 
in 1S35 and holding the office for seven years. He was assisted from 
time to time by George W. Boyd, Caleb Briggs, E. A. Aiken. C. B. 
Harden, Samuel Lewis. J. B. Rogers, H. D. Rogers, R. E. Rogers, 
Thomas S. Ridgeway, and M. Wells. The survey continued in exist- 
ence until the close of iS-p_\ the act of authorization being repealed by 
the legislature. 

No provision was made for the preparation of a final report, although 
Rogers was ready to undertake the same, and the idea not finally aban- 
doned until as late as 1854. The necessary appropriation was, how- 
ever, not granted, and the seven brief annual reports submitted are 
all there is to show for years of careful and patient work under most 
adverse circumstances. No map and no sections were published at 
the time. In 1884, after Rogers's death, a reprint of all these reports 
was made under the editorship of Maj. Jed. Hotchkiss, an engineer, of 
Staunton. Virginia. They formed an octavo volume of upward of rive 
hundred pages. This was accompanied by a small geological map 
which Rogers had previously colored for Hotchkiss, and by numerous 
plates of sections, which are, however, not described in the text. 

Under the conditions enumerated above, it is not surprising that 
the reports contained little of more than local interest, and that the 
broader aspects of geology w r ere barely touched upon. The region 
west of the Blue Ridge was described as occupied b} T fourteen groups 
of strata, which were designated by numbers, beginning with the 
lowermost. These all showed so general a conformit}' in superposi- 
tion, and so remarkable a correspondence in their mineralogical and 
physical characters, as to clearly indicate, he felt, the propriety of 
regarding them all as parts of one great series of strata accumulated 
over the widely expanded floor of the ancient ocean. 

No mention was made of the fossil contents of any of these beds, 
nor attempts at correlation or determination of their geological age. 
This seems the more remarkable when one considers the value attached 
to fossils by Rogers in his work on the Tertiary formations, where the 
inspection of a single shell, he claimed, would often enable one to pro- 
nounce upon the character of the stratum from which it was taken - 
that is, whether pertaining to the Eocene or Miocene. 

The Massanutten Mountains were recognized as one great synclinal 
tract resting in a trough of slate. It is worthy of note, in view of the 



342 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

EI. D. Rogers-Hitchcock controversy referred to elsewhere (p. 314), 
that in his report for 1838 Rogers described in considerable detail 
"the extraordinary phenomenon of inversion" presented throughout 
the. long - reach of North Mountains, whereby tin 1 entire series from 
formations II to VEII, inclusive, were found to lie conformably one 
upon the other, but in a reversed stratigraphical position; that is, the 
oldest above and the youngest at the bottom. No attempt, however, 
was made to account for the same. 

In the report for 1839 the Tertiary marl south of the James River 
was described in detail and its Eocene and Miocene subdivisions recog- 
nized. In that for 1840 was given a list of the fossils found in the 
Miocene marls, and attention called to the discovery of a " remarkable 
stratum varying from 12 to 25 feet in thickness, composed almost 
entirely of microscopic fossils (Diatoms), and lying between the 
Eocene and Miocene, but referred to neither." This, the first discov- 
ery of its kind in the United States, was referred to as an "infusory 
stratum." The coarse "middle secondary ,1 conglomerates of Vir- 
ginia, corresponding to the Potomac marble (Triassic) of Maryland, 
he regarded as having been deposited by strong currents coming from 
the southeast which laid down their load in a long, narrow trough 
extending from southwest to the northeast; such "being deposited in 
successive layers, commencing at its southeastern margin, would nat- 
urally assume the attitude of strata dipping toward the northwest." 

When one considers the condition of the country at the time Rogers 
did his work — the lack of facilities for transportation, the entire lack 
of maps sufficiently accurate for purposes of plotting, the deep mantle 
of residuary material that nearl} r everywhere obscured the more solid 
rocks, and that there were no railroad cuts or other artificial exposures, 
such as exist to-day — one can but admire its accuracy. It is not yet 
too late to express regrets that the parsimony of the legislature should 
have stood in the way of the preparation of a final report. 

W. B. Rogers undoubtedly derived a portion of his enthusiasm for 
geology from his brother Henry. The first manifestations of this 
mental trend appeared while professor of natural philosophy and 
chemistry at William and Mary College in 1833, when he set on foot 
inquiries relative to the greensand marl of Virginia. His first pub- 
lication, as given in his biography, however, related to artesian w T ells 
and appeared in the Farmer's Register of Richmond (1834-35). 

The poverty of his resources in 1835, while hopefully agitating the 
establishment of a State geological survey for Virginia, can not be bet- 
ter illustrated than by noting the request sent to his brother Henry, in 
Philadelphia, for the chemicals and apparatus mentioned below to be 

a In 1843 Tnomey announced the discovery of an infusorial stratum at Petersburg, 
in Virginia. This he referred to the lower portion of the Miocene. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1830-4839. 843 

used in the prosecution of his scientific work. The list comprised 1 
platinum capsule, 1 pound of absolute alcohol (French), one-half ounce 
oxide of ammonia, one-half pound distilled muriatic acid (pure), 1 
pound distilled nitric acid, one 4-ounce vial of phosphate of ammonia. 
1 foot small platinum wire for blowpipe. 
He wrote: 

My alcohol, with all the economy I have used, is almost exhausted. The gill 
which I had at the opening of the course has been used at least ten times in 
analysis, ami though carefully distilled off in each operation, a portion is, of 
course, lost. 

In August of 1835 Rogers was elected to the chair of natural philos- 
ophy in the University of Virginia, at Charlottesville, a position which 
he gladly accepted, being, undoubtedly, influenced in part at least by 
the more healthful climate of the latter place. 

His first years here were, however, full of trial, owing to the dual 
nature of his duties — teacher and State geologist — and the lawless char- 
acter of many of the students. Lacking, as he was, in physical stamina 
at the beginning, the trials as professor and the lack of appreciation of 
his work b}*- the State legislature undoubtedly wore upon him severely 
and had to do with his comparatively early breaking down. 

Like other of the broader men of his time, Rogers was an all-round 
scientist, and wrote not merely on geology, but made observations on 
the aurora, experiments with reference to binocular visions, and other 
subjects. 

As early as 1846, in connection with his brother Henry, he formu- 
lated plans for the Polytechnic School in Boston, which place he felt 
persuaded was on all accounts the best suited for an institution of this 
kind. " I long for an atmosphere of more stimulating power," he wrote 
from Charlottesville, and with these thoughts in mind he resigned his 
professorship in 1848, but was induced to reconsider and remain for 
five years longer. On his final removal to Boston in 1S53 he con- 
tinued to take an active part in scientific and educational matters. The 
year 1859 found him again actively advocating his plan for an institute of 
technology, the matter being brought forward at this time in connection 
with the so-called Back Bay lands and their rapidly enhancing value, 
and in 1801 an act to incorporate the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- 
nology passed the legislature and was approved by the governor. In 
1862, an organization having been perfected, he was elected its first 
president, an office he continued to hold until forced to resign by ill 
health in 1870. In 1878, his health having improved, he was again 
induced to temporarily accept the presidency, holding the position 
three years, and being succeeded by Gen. F. A. Walker. 

His reputation as a geologist rests mainly upon his work as State 
geologist of Virginia and that on the structure of the Appalachian

Chain in connection with his brother, II. D. Rogers. He was, how- 
ever, widely known as an educator and orator. To quote from one of 
his biographers: 

The wide extent of his own studies and researches in mechanics, physics, chem- 
istry ,*and geology; his truly philosophical spirit, his unfailing courtesy and urbanity, 
his warm sympathies, his scientific enthusiasm, his commanding and stately pres- 
ence, his rare gifts of expression, all combined to make him the ideal presiding 
officer. His introductions were most felicitous; his comments highly suggestive and 
inspiring; his summing up was always a masterpiece of discriminating and judicious 
reasoning, while, over all, his rich, tropical eloquence threw a spell as of poesy and 
romance, for to him the truth was always beautiful, and the most solid and substan- 
tial structure of scientific principle stood in his view against a sunset sky, radiant 
with a light which no painter's pencil ever had the art to fix to canvas. 

On April 15, 1836, there was authorized by the State assembly a 
geological and mineralogical survey of New 7 York. This led to an 
organization which has left a more lasting impression upon American 
geology than any that has followed or had preceded 
of^ew iC Yort ur r83 y 6. [t - As fate ordained, the locality was one of the most 
favorable that could have been selected for working 
out the fundamental principles of stratigraphic geology; moreover, 
those appointed to do the work proved equal to the occasion. The 
New York survey gave to American geology a nomenclature largely 
its own; it demonstrated above everything else the value of fossils for 
purposes of correlation, and incidentally it brought into prominence 
one man, James Hall, who was destined to become America's greatest 
paleontologist. 

To secure the greatest amount of individual freedom and to facili- 
tate the work to best advantage, the State was divided into four 
districts, W. W. Mather being placed in charge of the first, Ebenezcr 
Emmons the second, Timothy A. Conrad the third, and Lardner Van- 
uxem the fourth. The survey continued in existence for live years, 
reports being issued annually in the form of assembly documents, the 
final reports appearing in 1842-43 in the form of quarto volumes, com- 
prising, all told, over 2,000 pages and 82 plates, sections, and maps. 

The mineralogical and chemical work of the survey was placed under 
the charge of Dr. Lewis C. Beck, while Dr. John Torrey was made 
botanist and Dr. James E. De Kay given charge of the zoological 
department. At the end of the first season Conrad resigned, to become 
paleontologist of the survey, and- James Hall, who had previously 
been an assistant to Emmons, was put in charge of the fourth district, 
while Vanuxem was transferred to the second. As with all the earlier 
surveys, agriculture and mining were considered subjects of primary 
importance. The results of the survey can, however, be best consid- 
ered under the date of issue of the final reports (p. 374). 

This same year witnessed also the establishment of a geological 
survey in the adjoining State of Pennsylvania, of which H. D. Rogers,

also State geologist of New Jersey, was placed in charge. This sur- 
vey, as first planned, was expected to continue for a period of at least 
ten years, but. was brought to an abrupt close in L842,

of Pennsylvania, owing to the financial embarrassments of the Common- 
wealth. Rogers, however, unwilling to relinquish the 
work in its incomplete form, continued on his own responsibility, and 
largely at his own expense, for three years longer, and in 1N47 depos- 
ited in the office of the secretary of the Commonwealth his final report, 
ready for publication. For reasons to be noted later, the publication 
of this report was delayed until 1858. 

During its period of existence the survey issued six annual reports, 
the first bearing the date of 1836 and the last 1842. These were small 
octavos, destitute of illustration, with the exception of a few outline 
sections, and of from 100 to 250 pages each. The results of the work 
were so completely elaborated in the final reports issued in 1858 that 
these preliminary publications have been almost completely lost sight 
of and are of merely historical interest. It is well to note that, owing 
to the large proportion of foreign population in the State at that date, 
two editions of the preliminary reports were issued — one in English 
and one in German. This dual publication, so far as the present 
writer is aware, was paralleled only in the case of the Ohio survey, 
under Newberry. 

As with the New York survey, the results of Rogers's work can be 
best summed up in a consideration of the final reports (see p. 489.) 

After nearly ten years of agitation, there was passed by both houses 
of Congress, and approved by the President on May 14, 1836, a bill 
providing for an exploring expedition to the South Polar regions and 
the islands and coasts of the Pacific. This expedition, 
^xpedition^sio 2 which finally sailed from Norfolk on August 17, 1838, 
and which, from the name of its commander in chief, 
has come to be known as the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, had for 
its immediate object the increase of such knowledge as would be of 
interest and value to the whaling industry, w T hich had suffered severely 
through loss of men and vessels in these remote regions. Research 
along other lines was purely secondary. Fortunately, however, the 
scientific men of the day were full}' alive to the possibilities offered, 
and, through their influence, an efficient corps of trained observers in 
various lines was permitted to accompany it. Of these only the geolo- 
gist, J. D. Dana, who sailed on the Peacock, comes within the range of 
our present work, though incidental reference will be made to J. P. 
Couthouy, who sailed on the Vincennes. Inasmuch, however, as no 
tangible results from the expedition were made -known until after the 
return of Dana, in 1841, the entire matter may also be dismissed here 
and taken up again under the latter date. 



340 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

In March, 1830, sixteen years after her establishment on a basis of 
independent statehood, the legislature of Maine authorized the appoint- 
ment of " some suitable person" to make a geological survey of the 
State "as soon as circumstances will permit," appro- 
Ma&'l3 G 6 e 39 gy °' Plating the sum of $5,000 to cover expenses/' On 
June 25 a contract was entered into with Dr. C. T. 
Jackson for the carrying out of the same. Jackson seems to have 
entered upon his duties promptly and energetically, making his first 
report, a volume of 110 octavo pages, in December, 1830. This was 
accompanied by an atlas of 24 plates. His results were apparently 
satisfactory to the legislature, the appointment being renewed the fol- 
lowing year and $3,000 appropriated for expenses. Under this appro- 
priation a second annual report of 168 octavo pages was forthcoming. 
This in its turn was seemingly satisfactory, for the geologist's salary 
was increased from $1,000 to $1,500 a year, while the sum appropri- 
ated for the carrying on of the work was made discretionary with 
the governor and council. Under such favoring conditions it is not 
strange perhaps that the State geologist became effusive and brought 
his third (and last) report up to 270 pages, with an appendix of <i4 
pages, containing a catalogue of the collections. 

These reports, examined in the light of to-day, contain very little 
which would be considered of geological importance. Jackson seems 
to have roamed somewhat at random over the State, with little idea of 
the geological structure as a whole, and to have contented himself with 
making detailed notes on whatever was immediately at hand, regard- 
less of its possible relationship to other formations at a distance and 
with an eye particularly to economic questions. 

From the finding of marine shells at Lubec in layers of clay now 
some twenty-six feet above high- water mark, he rightly conjectured 
that the land had been elevated that amount within a comparatively 
recent period. He regarded the sandstones now known to be Devo- 
nian in the extreme eastern counties as identical with the red Triassic 
sandstones of Nova Scotia, and seriously discussed the possibility of 
their containing bituminous coal. The slates of Piscataquis County 
were classed as transition, and the possibilit}' of their carrying anthra- 
cite coal was likewise discussed. 

In his third annual report he noted the occurrence of fossil plants 
in the slates of Waterville and remarked on the discovery as being a 
strange occurrence, since the rocks belong to the older Transition 
series. 6 

« The legislature of Massachusetts authorized State cooperation in this survey so far 
as it related to certain public lands which were the joint property of the two States. 

h At the second session of the American Association of Geologists in Philadelphia, 
1841, Professor O. P. Hubbard exhibited a specimen of this slate and was able to 
show by the aid of "Murchison's Silurian system " that they were nut plant remains 
but annelid trails, a view which Jackson accepted. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY — DECADE OF 1830-1839. 347 

The possibility of the occurrence of beds of coal at Small Point 
Harbor near Phippsburg was investigated. As a result it was 
announced that there was no possibility of such being included in rock 
of the nature there found, and that the coal sometimes thrown up on the 
beach was presumably from English sources. So early a statement of 
this nature is interesting in view of borings for coal which have taken 
place along this coast within a very few years. 

Jackson's views on the glacial deposits were naturally crude. The 
" horsebacks" (ridges of glacial gravel) were regarded as diluvial 
material transported by a mighty current of water. 

It is supposed that this rushing of water over the land took place during the last 
grand deluge, accounts of which have been handed down by tradition and are pre- 
served in the archives of all people. Although it is commonly supposed that the 
deluge was intended solely for the punishment of the corrupt antediluvians, it is not 
improbable that the descendants of Noah reap many advantages from its influence, 
since the various soils underwent modifications and admixtures which render them 
better adapted for the wants of num. May not the hand of Benevolence be seen 
working even amid the waters of the deluge? 

It is, perhaps, doubtful if the hard-fisted occupant of many of 
Maine's rocky farms would be disposed to take so cheerful a view of 
the matter. 

However Jackson's work may impress the reader of to-day, it was 
considered by a reviewer in the American Journal of Science (XXXII, 
1837) as a "model of its kind. It has certainly not been surpassed by 
any similar effort in this country," and "The present sketch of Maine 
is a masterly production." 

In 1839 the general assembly of Rhode Island appropriated the sum 
of |2,000 to pay the expenses of a geological and agricultural survey 
of the State, and Doctor Jackson, fresh from his work in Maine, was 
placed in charge of this also, making his report the 
Jackson's survey of following year. This constituted the first, last, and 
Rhode island, 1839. only survey ot - Rhode Island carried on under State 

auspices. 

Such a work was naturally productive of little of importance, and 
no new principles whatever were evolved. Aside from the gathering 
of a few facts of possible economic value, it resulted on.y in an exten- 
sion of knowledge relative to the distribution of certain geologic 
groups. This, however, was a feature of all the work carried on by 
Jackson. As further illustrating the condition of geological knowl- 
edge, the report is, however, worthy of consideration. 

In his introduction he remarked on the attempt on the part of some 
geologists to abandon the name Transition and to group these rocks 
with the Secondary, according to the original schemes of Lehman, and 
felt that a numerical division would doubtless be found preferable to 
any of the fanciful names proposed for some of its subdivisions. 
The names Cambrian and Silurian, as proposed in England, he

thought, ""will never be regarded in this country as appropriate terms 
Tor our rocks." He recognized the existence of contact phenomena, 
and also that the degree of crystallization and general structural fea- 
tures ,of an igneous rock are dependent upon conditions of cooling, 
though he regarded pumice as being formed when the fused rock, 
under little pressure, was brought in contact with water. The pos- 
sibility of the cellular structure being due to expansion of vapor 
of water in the lava itself was not recognized. The hornblende rock, 
so extensively developed in Cumberland, Smithfield, and Johnston, he 
regarded as of igneous origin, and suggested that its apparent strati- 
form structure might be due to an admixture of the argillaceous slate 
through which it was elevated. 

The eruptive nature of the Cumberland iron ore was also recognized, 
though naturally the fact that the rock was an iron-rich peridotite 
partially altered into serpentine, as later described by Wadsworth, 
was overlooked. 

The origin of the drift was to him still obscure. Concerning the 
distribution in the form of bowlders of the iron ore to the southward, 
above mentioned, he wrote: 

There can not remain a doubt that a violent current of water has rushed over the 
surface of the State since the elevation and consolidation of all the rocks and subse- 
quent to the deposition of the tertiary clay, and that this current came from the 
north. * * * Upon the surface of solid ledges, wherever they have been recently 
uncovered of their soil, scratches are seen running north and south and the hard 
rocks are more or less polished by the currents of water which at the diluvial epoch 
coursed over their surfaces, carrying along the pebbles and sand which effected this 
abrasion, leaving strise, all of which run north and south, deviating a few degrees 
occasionally with the changes of direction given to the current by obstacles in its 
way. 

He did not accept the theory of drifting icebergs, "nor can we 
allow that any glaciers could have produced them by their loads of 
sliding rocks, for in that case they should radiate from the mountains 
instead of following a uniform course along hillsides and through 
valleys." 

The report was accompanied by six plates of Coal-Measure fossils 
and a geological map. 

Geological work in Delaware at the expense of the State began and 
ended with the survey by J. C. Booth, a chemist, during 1837-38. 
Incidentally, it may be remarked that Mr. Booth's career as a geolo- 
gist was equally prescribed. 

Booth's Survey fe • -• "1 -• A i *. uv U- ^1 

of Delaware, A unique feature of the act establishing the survey 

was the requirement that an equal portion of the 
appropriation should be expended in each county, regardless of exist- 
ing conditions. The clause was presumably inserted to allay local 
jealousies, but the absurdity of the same is, nevertheless, so great as 
to leave no room for comment. In the report, which appeared in the 




AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OE 1830-1839. 34 ( .) 

form of mi octavo volume of 188 pages in 1841, the geological forma- 
tions of the State were divided into (1) Primary, (2) Upper Secondary, 
(3) Tertiary, and (4) Recent. The geographical distribution and litho- 
logical character of each was given in detail. The Primary included 
gneiss, feldspathean rocks (traps), limestone, serpentine, and granite; 
the Upper Secondary, the Red Clay Formation and the Green Sand 
Formation. The Tertiary he divided into 
the northern Tertiary, the southern Terti- 
ary, the yellow-clay formation of Appo- 
quinimink Hundred, and the intermediate 
clays and sands. The Recent Formations 
were divided into the lower clays, the upper 
sands, and the river deposits. Attention 
was given to the Greenland and to other 
questions of economic interest. 

The report as a whole represents the 
patient attempt of a man unversed in the 
broader problems of geology who wrote 
down only what he saw and thought he

understood. His remarks on the weather- 
ing of rocks are perhaps the most striking. The entire cost of this 
survey to the State was $3,000, of which sum Booth received §2,000 
for his two years' work, the remainder going to defray cost of publi- 
cation of the report and various incidentals. 

In 1837 there was organized the first State geological survey of 

Indiana, Dr. D. D. Owen, who had served as an assistant on the survey of 

Tennessee under Gerard Troost, being appointed State geologist. The 

life of the survey was limited to two years, and two

of 1838, and one of 54 pages, bearing date of 1839. a 
The essential similarity of the formations of Indiana with those of 
Ohio was recognized. The lowest lying, oldest rock, called blue 
limestone, 6 which he regarded as the equivalent of the Lower Silu- 
rian limestones of Europe, was described as forming, near the com- 
mon boundary line between Indiana and Ohio, a kind of backbone 
which dipped gently in east and west directions, gradually disappear- 
ing in both States beneath a series of overlapping strata which, with 
one exception, have uniform characteristics. Here for the second 
time (see p. 333) is recognized the presence of the low swell known 
later as the Cincinnati anticline or uplift, which was subsequently 
identified by Newberry and Safford as a Middle Silurian emergence. 
This blue limestone was overlain by another limestone, regarded as the

recent writers. 



350 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1004. 

equivalentof the Cliff rock (Niagaran) of Doctor Locke; this, in its turn, 
by a series of black slates, the equivalent of the Waverly sandstones 
of Ohio, and this in turn by a series of limestones in part oolitic and 
the equivalent of the Ohio conglomerate. This last, immediately upon 
which the coal formation rests at Oil Creek, in Perry County, he con- 
sidered the uppermost member of a new series, to which he applied 
the name sub-Carboniferous, "as indicating its position immediately 
beneath the coal or Carboniferous group of Indiana, 1 ' and "which 
merely indicates its position beneath the Carboniferous group without 
involving any theory." 

Immediately overlying this sub-Carboniferous limestone was his 
bituminous coal formation, the latest and youngest of the series with 
the exception of the diluvium. He regarded the bituminous coal for- 
mation as a part of a great coal held which included nearly the whole 
of Iowa and Illinois and eight or ten counties in the northwestern part 
of Kentucky, and recognized the improbabilit3 r of anthracite coal being 
found within the limits of the State. 

He recognized the importance of fossils in geological correlation 
and, through the presence of the characteristic forms pentremites and 
archimedes, correctly referred the oolitic rock to the sub-Carbonifer- 
ous, notwithstanding its close lithological resemblance to the Jurassic 
oolites of England and the European continent." 

David Dale Owen was a son of Robert Owen, the well-known phil- 
anthropist and founder of the communistic societies at New Lanark, 
Scotland, and New Harmony, Indiana. He first came to America in 
1828, but in 1831 returned to Europe, in company 
ixD^Owen. with Prof. H. D. Rogers, for the purpose of qualify- 

ing himself in chemistry and geology. Returning to 
America in 1832, he studied medicine at the Ohio Medical College in 
Cincinnati, from whence he graduated in 1836. 

His earliest geological work was done in connection with Dr. Gerard 
Troost in Tennessee, and his earliest independent work that which has 
just been mentioned. Subsequently he made surveys under the United 
States General Land Office, in which work he showed administrative 
ability of no ordinary kind. Indeed, the organization and carrying out 
of the plan for a survey of the mineral lands of Iowa, Minnesota, and 
Wisconsin (in 1839-40) within the short space of time and under the 
conditions imposed Vy Congress was a feat of generalship which has 
never been equalled in American geological history. 

« There are ni merous references in the reports of 1838 and 1839 to sections and a 
geological map which, however, were apparently never published. In a partial 
reprint hearing date of 1859 entitled "Continuation of Report, of the Geological 
Reconnaissance of the State of Indiana," made in 1838, where reference is again 
made to tins map, occurs the following footnote: "The original geological map here 
referred to was deposited in the State library hut lias not been published."

AMERICAN GEOLOGT — DECADE OF 1830—1839. 351 

His life was one of unceasing - activity and furnished one more illus- 
tration of the energy, persistence, and virility of the Scotch emigrants 
and their descendants in America. He is described as a man of amia- 
bility, simplicity, and integrity of purpose, and certainly was an artist 
of no inconsiderable ability, as is exemplified by the sketches in his 
numerous reports. The geological sections given by him in the report 
on the Chippewa land district have never been equalled for picturesque 
effect (see Plate 19). 

To properly appreciate much that is to follow, it must be remem- 
bered that, beginning with 1807, all Government lands containing ores 
were reserved from sale and a system of leasing adopted. No leases 
d. d. Owen's were, however, issued until L822, and little mining 

wYsconsVn f , l^nT' was done previous to 1826. For a few years, accord- 
iihnois, 1839-40. j n g, ^ Q Whitney, rents for the mining lands were paid 
by the operators with comparative regularity, but after 1834, in con- 
sequence of the innumerable fraudulent entries of lands as agricultural 
which should, in reality, have been reserved as mineral, the smelters 
and miners refused to make any further payments, and the United 
States officers were entirely unable to enforce the claims of the Gov- 
ernment. 

In consequence of these difficulties a resolution was adopted in the 
House of Representatives, on the Oth of February, 1839 — 

That the President of the United States be requested to cause to be prepared, and 
presented to the next Congress at an early day, a plan for the sale of the public 
mineral lands, having reference as well to the amount of revenue to-be derived from 
them and their value as public property as to the equitable claims of individuals 
upon them; and that he at the same time communicate to Congress all the informa- 
tion in possession of the Treasury Department relative to their location, value, 
productiveness, and occupancy; and that he cause such further information to be 
collected and surveys to be made as may be necessary for these purposes. 

In accordance with this act Doctor Owen was appointed Govern- 
ment geologist under direction of the General Land Office (James 
Whitcomb, Commissioner) to make surveys in Iowa, Wisconsin, and 
northern Illinois. His first report, bearing date of April 2, 1840, was 
printed to form House Document No. 239, of the First session of the 
Twenty-sixth Congress." It comprised, all told, 161 printed octavo 
pages, with 25 plates and maps, including a colored geological map 
and several colored sections. Fourteen of the plates were from 
Owen's own drawings. The district explored comprised an area of 
about 11,000 square miles lying in equal portions on both sides of the 
Mississippi River, between latitude 41° and 43°, beginning at the 
north of Rock River and extending thence north upward of 100 
miles to the Wisconsin River. (See tig. 45.) 

"A reprint or second edition of the work was brought out in form of Senate Doc- 
ument No. 407, 28th Congress, 1844. 



352 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, W04. 

Doctor Owen's commission reached him at New Harmony-, Indiana, 
on August IT, 1839, and its acceptance demanded that he explore "all 
the land in the Mineral Point and Galena districts which are situated 
south of the Wisconsin and north of the Rock rivers, and west of the 
line* dividing ranges 8 and 9 east of the fourth principal meridian; 
together with all the surveyed lands in the Dubuque district, 11 and 
complete his work before the approaching winter should set in. Con- 
cerning these somewhat remarkable conditions, Owen writes: 

After duly weighing the nature of my instructions, estimating the extent of coun- 
try to be examined, considering the wild, unsettled character of a portion of it, and 
the scanty accommodations it could afford to a numerous party (which rendered 
necessary a carefully calculated system of purveyance), and ascertaining that the 
winter, in that northern region, commonly sets in with severity from the 10th to the 
middle of November, my first impression was that the duty required of me was 
impracticable of completion within the given time, even with the liberal permission 
in regard to force accorded to me in my instructions. But on a more careful review 
of the means thus placed at my disposal, I finally arrived at the conclusion that by 
using diligent exertion, assuming much responsibility, and incurring an expense 
which I was aware the Department might possibly not have anticipated, I might, in 
strict accordance with my instructions, if favored by the weather and in other 
respects, succeed in completing the exploration in the required time. 

I therefore immediately commenced engaging subagents and assistants and pro- 
ceeded to St. Louis. There (at my own expense, to be repaid to me out of the per 
diem of the men employed) I laid in about $3,000 worth of provisions and camp fur- 
niture, including tents, which I caused to be made for the accommodation of the 
whole expedition; and in one month from the day on which [ received my commis- 
sion and instructions in Indiana (to wit, on the 17th of September) I had reached 
the mouth of Rock River; engaged one hundred and thirty-nine subagents and assist- 
ants; instructed my subagents in such elementary principles of geology as were neces- 
sary to the performance of the duties required of them; supplied them with simple 
mineraiogical tests, with the application of which they were made acquainted ; organ- 
ized twenty-four working corps, furnished each with skeleton maps of the townships 
assigned to them for examination, and placed the whole at the points where their 
labors commenced, all along the southern line of the western half of the territory to 
be examined. Thence the expedition proceeded northward, each corps being 
required, on the average, to overrun and examine thirty quarter sections daily, and 
to report to myself on fixed days at regularly appointed stations; to receive which 
reports, and to examine the country in person, I crossed the district under examin- 
ation, in an oblique direction, eleven times in the course of the survey. Where 
appearances of particular interest presented themselves, I either diverged from my 
route, in order to bestow upon these a more minute and thorough examination; or, 
when time did not permit this, I instructed Dr. John Locke, of Cincinnati (formerly 
of the geological corps of Ohio, and at present professor of chemistry in the medical 
college of Ohio), whose valuable services I had been fortunate enough to engage on 
this expedition, to inspect these in my stead. 

By the 24th of October the exploration of the Dubuque district was completed, and 
the special reports of all the townships therein were dispatched to your office and to 
the office of the register at Dubuque. On the 14th of November the survey of the 
Mineral Point district was in a similar manner brought to a close, and by the 24th 
of November our labors finally terminated at Stephenson, in Illinois, the examina- 
tions of all the lands comprehended in my instructions having been completed in 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1830-1839. 353 

two months and six days from the date of our actual commencement in the field. 
Also several thousand specimens — some of rare beauty and interest— were collected, 
arranged, and labeled. 

The. immediate result of this examination was to establish the fact 
"that the district surveyed is one of the richest mineral regions, com- 
pared to extent, jet known in the world." The area marked off as 
including the productive lead region, as shown by his map. lay mainly 
in Wisconsin, but comprised also a strip of about eight townships on 
the Iowa side of the river and about ten townships in the northwest 
corner of Illinois, the ore-bearing strata being limited to a heavy 
bedded magnesian limestone which, on account of its characteristic 
tendency to form perpendicular cliffs when subjected to weathering 
and erosion, he called the Cliff limestone. This, he thought, from its 
fossil remains, to be the equivalent of the Upper Silurian, and perhaps 
a part of the Lower Silurian of Murchison. Though sparingly devel- 
oped in the east, this, according to Owen, "swells in the Wisconsin 
lead region into the most remarkable, most important, and most bulky 
member of the group. It becomes, as it were, the Aaron's rod, swal- 
lowing up all the rest," and attaining a thickness of upward of 500 
feet." 

Owen's principal assistants were Dr. John Locke, who reported 
mainly on the barometrical observations, with particular reference to 
the measurement of altitudes and the making of geological sections, 
and a Mr. E. Phillips, who reported on the timber, soil, and pro 
ductiveness of the region. 

On April 18, 1838, Abraham Gesner, whose work in Nova Scotia 
w T e have already referred to (p. 336), was appointed provincial geologist 
of New Brunswick, a position he continued to hold until 1843, mak- 
ing during this time live brief reports, comprising" 

Gesner's Work in & ° .... te 

New Brunswick, ill together but 440 pages. A partial geological map 
was prepared, but never published. A considerable 
portion of the reports was given up to a discussion of economic mat- 
ters, particularly the coal beds, the value of which, as noted later, he 
quite overestimated. The first four reports deal largely with that 
portion of the province south of the Miramichi, Xashwaak, and St. 
John's rivers. The fifth and last (1843) describes the country of the 
upper St. John and that between the headwaters of the Tobique and 
Ristigouche rivers. 

A gradual advance is to be noted, particularly where Gesner in bis 
second report subdivided his graywacke, which he thought comparable

objected, claiming that the Niagara, as known in the east, represented only a part 
of the formation he was describing, hi this last he was certainly right, more recent 
work having shown that his Cliff limestone included also beds belonging to what is 
now known as the Trenton period of the Lower Silurian.

with Murchison's Silurian, into upper and lower members, of which 
the upper contained a fossil mollusk which he identified as a terebrat- 
ulite, and which Dr. G. F. Matthew" thinks to have been probably 
a soniewhat poorly preserved Orthis billingsi. He also reported 
the finding of remains of conifers, calamites, and a cactus (?), the last 
being- regarded by Matthew as some form imitative of a stigmaria. 
Though the full significance of these fossil remains was not appre- 
ciated by Gesner, yet he must be regarded as a pioneer in making 
known the flora of both the Cambrian and Carboniferous beds in New 
Brunswick. 

In his fourth report he classed this graywacke with Sedgwick's 
Cambrian. About this time (1842) he seems to have become acquainted 
with Agassiz's glacial theories and referred to the expressed opinions 
of Lyell and Buckland with reference thereto, but thought that "the 
general occurrence of diluvial grooves and scratches upon the sur- 
faces of the rocks * * * can not in general be explained unless 
by admitting that a great current of water has passed over the coun- 
try from the north toward the south," though "it appears that ancient 
glaciers have had a powerful influence in the accumulation of those 
parallel mounds of erratic sand and gravel observed in different parts 
of these provinces, and likewise the} r may have been the means whereby 
bowlders of granite and other rocks have been scattered over the 
country." 

In this, his fifth report, he gave a general description of the coal 
fields of the province, which he estimated as embracing an area of 
8,700 square miles, or nearly one-third the entire area of New r Bruns- 
wick, making it one of the largest in the world. Through the influ- 
ence of these reports a great deal of interest was excited in the public 
mind concerning the mineral wealth of the province. A large number 
of mining adventures were undertaken with the expectation of imme- 
diate and favorable returns. Few of these were, however, successful, 
and the reaction in public feeling tended to throw discredit on Ges- 
ner's work and probably was influential in terminating his engage- 
ment, the survey being brought to an abrupt conclusion in 1848. 

The problem of the Tertiary deposits of the southern Atlantic 
States, which up to date had been touched upon in a scientific manner 
only by Finch, Morton, Vanuxem, and Lea, was again, in 1839, 
taken up by T. A. Conrad. In the journal of the 
on the Tertiary, Philadelphia Academy of Sciences for this year Con- 
rad described the Tertiary of Maryland as occupying 
all the tract south of an irregular line running from the vicinity of 
Baltimore to Washington, the Potomac being the western and the 
Chesapeake the eastern boundary. The deposit in the vicinity of Fort

AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1830-1839. 355 

Washington on the Potomac, he suggested, was probably contempo- 
raneous with the London clay, i. e. Eocene. 

The cause of the change in the character of animal life between rocks 
belonging to the different animal horizons, was regarded by Conrad as 
due to climatic changes. ""Periodical refrigeration alone can explain 
the sudden extinction of whole races of animals and vegetables." 

It is well to note that in his Geological Report for the State of New 
York, Conrad recognized the fact that in the earlier eras of our planet 
the temperature was uniform and the seas comparatively shallow. 
Hence, he thought, in the older rocks we should expect to find organic 
remains belonging to one group of species over the whole globe. 
Deep erosion and greater variation of temperature had caused more 
uncertainty in the Upper Tertiary formations. 

In connection with Conrad's work, it may not be out of place to note 
that Prof. J. L. Kiddell this same year described the surface geology 
of Trinity County, Texas, and, basing his determinations mainly on 
the beds of lignite there found, put down the prevailing sandstone 
as Tertiary. 

Incidentally, also, it may be noted that during 1840 Mr. James T. 
Hodge made a trip through the eastern portion of the southern Atlan- 
tic States and made extensive collections of fossils, which were turned 
over to Conrad for identification. Hodge's notes, as published in the 
Transactions of the Association of American Geologists, contain little 
of geological value, but the list of fossils comprised some 134 species, of 
which 32 were then new to science. All were of Tertiary age. 

Conrad was born in Philadelphia in 1803, and from early youth 
showed a decided taste for natural-history studies, though for a time 
following the calling of his father — that of a publisher and printer. 
The work noted on page 306 was his second of geolog- 
sketch of Conrad. ical importance, and was preceded also in 1831 by a 
paper on American marine conchology. Of his subse- 
quent writings on conchology, paleontology, or general geology upward 
of twenty related to the Tertiary, and it is upon these that his fame as a 
geologist chieily rests, though in addition he described the fossils col- 
lected by the Wilkes exploring expedition, by Lieutenant Lynch's 
expedition to the Dead Sea, by the Mexican boundary survey under 
Lieutenant Emery, and was first geologist and then paleontologist 
to the New York State survey. 

Personally Conrad was peculiar. 

He wrote his letters and labels frequently on all sorts of scraps of paper, generally 
without date or location. He was naturally careless or unmethodical, and his cita- 
tions nf other authors' works can not he safely trusted without verification, ami are 
usually incomplete. He had a very poor memory, ami on several occasions has 
redescribed his own species. This defect increased with aye, and, while no question 
of willful misstatement need arise, made it impossible to place implicit confidence in 
his own recollections of such matters as dates of publication. (Dall.) 



356 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

He himself says, in a characteristic letter to F. B. Meek, written 
July, 1863: 

I go on Monday to help H. ferret out my skulking species of paleozoic shells. 
May the recording angel help me. God ami 1 knew them once, and the Almighty 
may know still. A man's memory is no part of his soul. 

Conrad was bitterly opposed to the doctrine of evolution, and pre- 
dicted that Darwin's wild speculations would soon be forgotten. Every 
geological age came, according to him, to a complete close, and the life 
of the succeeding one was a wholly new creation. His feeling on this 
subject is well shown in a letter, also to Meek, dated February, 1869, 
where he says: 

I sent yon to-day a copy of my paper in Kerr's geological report. I perceive by 
Cope, Martin, and Hayden's researches that they have not found that phantom of 
the imagination, a formation between chalk and Eocene. The world has been so 
thoroughly harried by despairing development philosophers with so little result that 
they may as well say the "game is up," and not speculate on lost formations lying 
at the bottom of the ocean, a desperate expedient to save genetic succession. It is 
strange that geologists can not recognize an Azoic, era after the chalk. I consider, in 
the light of paleontology, the advent of one only form of life in the beginning to be 
absurd. The history of Lingula ought to teach us the permanence of certain forms 
of life from the beginning, while thousands of others were created and died out. 

Poor in health, given to melancholy and low spirits, he furnished 
to American geological history that which has a counterpart only in 
Percival, and like Percival, it may be added, he was sometimes given 
to rhyming, though unlike Percival, lie was slovenly and careless in 
his work to a point beyond endurance. 

His melancholy increased with age, and frequent ill health caused 
him at times to lose interest in every undertaking. 

A period of moping would usually end in his writing some verses which nobody 
would praise, and this seemed sufficiently to nettle him, to rouse him thoroughly, 
and he would become again enthusiastic in the matter of shells and fossils. 

It was presumably during one of these moping periods that he 
wrote again to Meek under date of October 24, 1864, as follows: 

I am troubled with the cui bono malady, and frequently wish to be under the 
"clods of the valley." The idea of suicide haunts me continually, and I wish to 
get to work to banish the horrors, but whatever side I look at work it brings 
expenses I think I would regret. Singular inconsistencies of man. I don't expect 
to live much longer, yet shrink from expenses, but such is the hard mental twist 
that early poverty gives the mind. My blues have been considerably increased by 
the death of Doctor Moore, « who I loved more than most other men, and by the 
death of my nearest and dearest sister with whom I lived in Trenton. Now r I must 
plunge into the marl beds to keep up a little time longer and hope to finish the 
Miocene figures before I go where no dreams of new discoveries will haunt me. 
Excuse this egotism; it is the last of it; but you now see why I do so little. Only 
one thing remains. I don't suppose yon feel the want of a home, but I have felt it 
all my life, and the dreams of an Egeria have overtopped the dreams of science, so

that in the midst of geological pursuits a horrid vacancy has yawned in my heart, 
and a grinning devil laughed unit a drawer of fossil shells. A small Hamlet in 
science, 1 grow <>ld and reform not. 

Conrad, though primarily a paleontologist, was sometimes drawn 
out of his chosen held by phenomena too obvious to be overlooked, 
and concerning- the nature of which little was actually known, even by 
the best authorities. The occurrence of enormous 
Se Driit/iSSp. 01 bowlders in the drift and resting often upon uncon- 
solidated sand and gravel, naturally called for an 
explanation. That such could not have been brought into their present 
position through floods was to him obvious, neither could they have 
been floated by ice floes from the north during a period of terrestrial 
depression. 

He assumed, rather, that the country, previous to what is now 
known as the glacial epoch, was covered with enormous lakes, and 
that a change in climate ensued, causing them to become frozen 
and converted into immense glaciers. At the same time, elevations 
and depressions of the earth's surface were in progress, giving various 
degrees of inclination to the' frozen surfaces of the lakes, down which 
bowlders, sand, and gravel would be impelled to great distances from 
the points of their origin. The impelling force might, in some cases. 
be gravity alone; but during the close of the epoch, when the tempera- 
ture had risen, vast landslides — avalanches of mud tilled with detritus — 
would be propelled for many miles over these frozen lakes, and when 
the ice disappeared the same would be deposited in the form of a 
promiscuous aggregate of sand, gravel, pebbles, and bowlders. The 
polished and scratched surface of the rocks in western New York he 
ascribed to the action of sand and pebbles, which were carried by 
moving bodies of ice, that is. apparently, to local glaciation. 

The year 1839 seems to have been one of remarkable activity among 
American geologists. Moreover, the various publications began to 
show a greater variation in individual opinion and a disposition on 
the part of maiiy to judge for themselves rather than 
v^w g s e ^839 ayes s follow too implicitly the opinions of others. Many of 
the ideas put forward were naturally crude (How" could 
they be otherwise?), but furnish us with a very good insight into the 
gradual evolution of ideas upon a great variety of subjects. 

George E. Hayes wrote upon the geology and topograph}" of western 
New" York and incidentally put forth several theoretical ideas worth}- 
of mention, even though ill-founded. He took occasion to deplore the 
common custom of invoking the assistance of the Noachian deluge to 
account for such results as erosion and the distribution of the drift. 
He felt that " the condition of a continent gradually elevated from the 
ocean, whether by volcanic action or by the expansive force of crys 
tallization, or by any other cause whatever, would be such as to 



858 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

account for all the geological phenomena hitherto attributed to the 
mechanical action of water." The formation of such terraces as Hitch- 
cock had described in the valley of the Connecticut he thought might 
be % due to the action of waves and tides. He regarded it as idle to 
suppose that existing streams have carved out their own channels, and 
ridiculed the idea that the falls of Niagara were once at Lewiston, 
seven miles below their present position, as had been contended by 
the English geologist, Bakewell. 

He also decried all attempts at estimating the age of the falls or the 
time before they would so far cut back as to drain Lake Erie. It w r as 
his idea that the channel below the falls was cut while the rocks were 
being slowly raised above the level of the great inland sea and forming 
a limestone ridge or reef across which, at its lowest points, strong- 
currents would alternately sweep during the ebb and flow of the tides. 
As the elevation progressed the currents would become more and 
more confined to the weakest and lowest points in the barrier, until 
in course of time the whole force of the conflicting currents would be 
concentrated at one, point. "The power of the waves and the influx 
of the tide operating from below would be applied to the best possible 
advantage in tearing up the strata which most impeded their course, 
while the current, combined with the receding tide, would carry off 
the fragments. In this manner the valley of the Niagara was doubt- 
less formed." (See Hall's views, p. 384.) 

The lake beds of the region he imagined to have been formed by the 
unequal erosion along the edges of uplifted strata, Lake Erie lying at 
the junction of shale and limestone. Before this limestone had become 
sufficiently elevated to shut out the sea from the basin now occupied 
by the lakes he conceived a strong current to have set in through the 
Gulf of St. Lawrence, finding its way through the valleys of the 
Mohawk and Hudson, and dropping on its course the large quantity 
of bowlders foreign to the localities now so plentifully distributed 
over the surface. 

As earl} T as 1823 Governor Woodbury, in his message to the State 
legislature of New Hampshire, had recommended an agricultural sur- 
vey, having particularly in mind chemical investigations of the various 
kinds of soils. It was not, however, until 1839 that, 

Jackson's Survey of . „ „. __ 

New Hampshire, under the earnest solicitation of Governor .rage, a 

1839-40. . ... . ° ' 

geological and mineralogical survey was organized, 
and Dr. C. T. Jackson placed at its head. This survey continued for 
three years, receiving annual appropriations of $3,000 to cover all 
expenses. The final report appeared in the form of an octavo volume 
of 375 pages, with two plates of colored sections and an uncolored 
map of the State on which the various formations, or, rather, rock 
types, were indicated by numbers. The localities of useful minerals, 
peats, etc., were also indicated, as were the dip and strike of the more

important rocks. J. I). Whitney served as assistant in the laboratory 
of the survey. 

As with other of Jackson's reports, this work contained scarcely 
anything- of a theoretic or advanced nature, although he did suggest 
that the apparent dipping of the Vermont marble beds under the Green 
Mountains might be due to "a folding or doubling back of the strata, 
which may curve around and pass down toward the shores of Lake 
Champlain, where the same strata may be composed of marine shells." 
He noted also that the secondary rocks must at some time have been 
horizontal and formed a continuous deposit extending entirely across 
the region now occupied by the White Mountains. If, however, the 
secondary strata were to be restored to their original horizontal posi- 
tion, he found an insufficiency of materials to cover the gap left by 
the removal of the primary rocks composing these mountains. This 
he would ascribe to the breaking up of the secondary rocks at this 
point through the sudden elevation of the primaries and a more or less 
altering of the same by heat. 

It was Jackson's idea, as set forth in this report, that highly 
inclined stratified rocks could have been made to assume that position 
only by some distorting cause other than aqueous action. This cause 
he conceived to be "a deep-seated power residing in the interior of 
the crust of the globe,"' the power itself being furnished by the 
"great caldron of molten rocks and pent up gases and steam, there 
being no more difficulty in our conceiving of the adequacy of this 
force than in the prodigious power of steam in moving the enormous 
engines" daily seen in operation. He conceived that a better idea of 
this power might be gained if one " look to the dimensions of the 
earth's great boiler, and consider the comparative thinness of its 
sides." Volcanoes he devoutly referred to as safety valves which 
prevented a general upbursting of volcanic tires, and "hold all in the 
most perfect order, and preserve the earth in safety." 

His views regarding the glacial drift would seem to have undergone 
no appreciable change since 1839, although perhaps somewhat dif- 
ferently expressed in the later reports. He wrote of this drift as due 
to the "ocean waters and seas of ice from the polar regions having 
been hurled with violence over the surface of the northern hemisphere 
during a period of shallow subsidence." The drifting of bowlder- 
laden icebergs would account for the glacial strhe, but the glacial 
theory of Agassiz he looked upon as quite insufficient and absurd. It 
is to be noted, however, that his only conception of glaciers was that 
of mountain glaciers of the Swiss type, the onetime presence of 
which was disproved by the nonradiating character of the drift and 
striae. This glacial flood to which he now appealed, however, was not 
regarded as contemporaneous with the Noachian deluge, but as having 
occurred before the advent of man.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



He recognized the plant origin of the coal beds, considering them 
as products of growth in low, moist, and warm bogs, which were at 
no great height above sea level, and which were frequently subjected 
to slow and gradual submergence and reelevation, in this following 
the other authorities of the day. 

In 1837 there was organized a State geological survey of Michigan, 

the sum of $3,000 being appropriated for the carrying out of the 

work the first year, the amount being increased to $6,000, $8,000, and 

$12,000, respectively, for each of the three succeeding 

Mich^a ", '^ r 4i in years, which limited the life of the organization. 

Douglass Houghton, then not 30 years of age, 
was made State geologist, and during his term of office issued five 
annual reports, the last bearing date of 1842. His chief assistants 
were Bela Hubbard and C. C Douglas. During the winter of 1837-38 
the survey was reorganized with particular reference to provisions 

for zoological, botanical, and topographical 
departments, and additional assistants were 
appointed to take charge of these branches 
of the work. 

In his first annual report, a document of 37 
pages, Houghton noted the geological fea- 
tures of the Lower Peninsula, classifying the 
formations under the heads of upper sand 
rock, gray limestone, and lower sandstone or 
gray wacke group, lying for the most part in 
♦nearly horizontal positions. The sandstones 
of the Upper Peninsula were regarded as 
belonging to the Carboniferous series." 

In his second annual report he detailed 
the topographical and general character of 
the northern portion of the peninsula, with special remarks upon the 
clays, marls, and gypsums. He devoted considerable attention to a 
consideration of the change of elevation in the waters of the Great 
Lakes, which were then at a higher point than had been known for 
many years. Many rather startling and mysterious reports had been 
previously circulated regarding the abrupt change in the level of the 
water of the lakes, and hence Houghton's report at this time was of 
particular significance. His conclusions were to the effect that the 
entire series of changes were due to periods of increased rainfall. 

A special report on the State salt springs was also submitted at about 
this time. In this Houghton announced that he had visited the salines 
of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Ohio with the view of acquiring infor- 
mation to guide his procedure, and had commenced the boring of two 
wells one on the Tittabawassee, near the mouth of Salt River, and

the other at Grand River, a few miles west of Grand Rapids. Both 
wells, it may be stated, have proved failures, owing to the weakness 
of the brine. 

The third annual report, of 11 1 pages, contained a description of the 
topography and geology of the portion of the Upper Peninsula bor- 
dering on Lakes Michigan and Huron, together with notices of the coal, 
iron, stone, and hog ores of the southern peninsula. The rocks of 
the Upper Peninsula were classified as primary and sedimentary, the 
latter being subdivided into a lower lime rock and shales and upper 
lime rocks. 

The fourth annual report, 1841, was given up largely to articles by 
Doctor Houghton on the topography, geology, and mineralogy of the 
country bordering Lake Superior. This contained also a description 
of the mineral veins of the trap and conglomerate. Although not so 
stated here, it may be well to remark that Houghton regarded the 
copper-bearing veins of the Lake Superior region as fissure veins 
tilled from below by the metal in a state of vapor or of compounds 
having their origin from copper in the native form. 

The fifth annual report was limited to but six pages, owing to the 
fact that the appropriations by the legislature were curtailed, the 
country suffering under pressure of a financial crisis. Houghton was 
not, however, content to drop the work, and in 1844, in connection 
with W. A. Burt, devised a plan for connecting the linear surveys of 
the public lands of the United States with the geological and mineral- 
ogical survey of the country. This plan was fully set forth in a paper 
prepared and read by him before the Association of American Geolo- 
gists at Washington in that } r ear. LTnder the recommendation of the 
General Land Office Congress appropriated funds for the purpose, and 
Doctor Houghton was appointed to undertake the work. According 
to the plan thus agreed upon Mr. Burt was to take charge of running 
the township lines of the Upper Peninsula, the subdivisions to he made 
by deputy surveyors, and Doctor Houghton was to have the director- 
ship of the entire work. The rocks crossed by lines were to be exam- 
ined, and observations made as to the general geological and topo- 
graphical features of the country. The system had been fairly organ- 
ized and the field work of one season nearly completed when, on the 
13th of October, 1845, Doctor Houghton met his death by drowning 
during a snowstorm, while making his way in an open sailboat along 
the west shore of Lake Superior. 

Houghton graduated in 1828 at what was then America's chief train- 
ing school for geologists, the Rensselaer Polytechnic 
sketch of Houghton, institute, and was almost immediately appointed assist- 
ant to Professor Eaton. In 1830, having but just 
attained his majority, he delivered a course of lectures at Detroit on 
chemistry, botany, and geology, an example no man of several times his 



362 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

age would care to follow to-day unless quite regardless of his reputa- 
tion. But such was the condition of knowledge at that time. In 1831 
he entered upon the practice of medicine, and soon after received the 
appointment of surgeon and botanist to the expedition under School- 
craft for the discovery of the sources of the Mississippi. His public 
career as a scientific man began, therefore, with that date. 

Houghton is described by his biographer as a man of rather small 
stature, with hands and feet small and delicately formed; head large 
and well developed; with blue eyes, well sheltered underneath massive 
brows, and showing upon his ears, nostrils, and mouth scars from an 
accidental explosion of powder, which took place during some of his 
boyish experiments. In early life he had suffered severely from a 
hip disease which had left one leg a little short, though not sufficiently 
so to cause him to limp. His temperament was warm and nervous; 
his movements quick and earnest. Young, ardent, and generous to a 
fault, he seems to have made friends wherever he went, and soon 
became the most prominent and popular man in the State. 

Everywhere his ability and energy were acknowledged. No name throughout the 
distant and rural districts was so often uttered. His daring, his generous acts, his 

g 1 humor, his racy stories were repeated everywhere. * * Every man 

seemed to feel a pride in the growing celebrity of Houghton, and the familiar epi- 
thets "The little doctor," " Our Doctor Houghton," " The boy geologist of Michi- 
gan," became common throughout the State.

CHAPTER IV. 

THE ERA OF STATE SURVEYS, SECOND DECADE, 1840-1849. 

The fever for State surveys, so prevalent during- the last decade, 
would seem to have very quickly subsided, since during- the period 
now under consideration such were established only in Alabama, 
South Carolina, and Vermont. Governmental surveys were also few, 
being limited to those by P. D. Owen in the Chippewa land district, 
and Jackson, Foster, and Whitney in the Lake Superior region. 

The cause of this sudden cessation is not quite apparent. Nine of 
the twenty-six States forming the Union at the beginning of the 
decade had, so to speak, escaped the contagion, and onh' the three 
above mentioned succumbed during the period, leaving Arkansas, 
Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky. Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri 
still unprovided for. It is possible, and perhaps probable, that the 
period of great financial depression beginning in 1830 may have had 
something to do with it, but as nine of the sixteen inaugurated dur- 
ing the decade 1830-184:0 were established either during 1836 or the 
three years immediately following, this is perhaps open to question. 
An important factor may have been the lack of geologists to agitate the 
subject and carry on the work, nearly every man of prominence and 
experience being engaged in surveys and organizations already under 
way. The period was. nevertheless, one of importance, one of mani- 
fest results rather than of organization and preparation. 

The single event of greatest consequence during the decade was the 
appearance of the four quarto volumes constituting the final reports 
of Mather, Emmons, Hall, and Vanuxem of the New York survey, an 
event which would, however, have been paralleled by the reports of 
Rogers in Pennsylvania but for the dilatoriness of the State author- 
ities. The volume of literature was naturally greater than at any., 
previous period, since it included many of the reports of organizations 
of the previous decade, as those of Percival in Connecticut (INI:'). 
Booth in Delaware (1811), Jackson in New Hampshire (1811) and 
Rhode Island (1810), and Rogers in New Jersey (1810). The estab- 
lishment of a geological survey of Canada in 1811, the coming of 
Lyell to America in the same year, the publication of his "Travels" 
in 1844, and the coming of Agassiz in 1846 should also be mentioned. 
The most noted of the participants in the events of the decade, as will 
be seen, were H. D. Rogers, then in full vigor; Edward Hitchcock. 

363 



364 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

mature and conservative; D. D. Owen, by all means the leader in 
reconnaissance work, and W . \Y. Mather. James Hall was rapidly 
forging to the front among paleontologists, while J. D. Dana, in the 
full Hush of early manhood and fresh from the experiences of the 
Wilkes expedition, began the important series of papers dealing with 
the grander problems of earth history which soon placed him foremost 
in the ranks of American geologists and. indeed, among the geologists 
of the world. 

Among the names which were to appear prominently in the decade 
will be found those of E. T. Cox, Ebenezer Emmons, J. P. Lesley, 
F. B. Meek, B. F. Shumard, Michael Tuomey, and J. D. Whitney. 

Geology, at the opening of the decade, had found a place in the 
curricula of the leading colleges of the land, as at Bowdoin, in Maine; 
Amherst and Williams, in Massachusetts; Yale, in Connecticut; the 
Rensselaer Institute, in New York; the University of Virginia, at 
Charlottesville; the University of North Carolina, at Chapel Hill, and 
the College of South Carolina, at Columbia. 

The Smithsonian Institution came into existence also during this 
period. The National Institute for the Promotion of Science and the 
Society of American Naturalists and Geologists were formed at the 
very beginning of the decade, the last named to be in 1847 merged 
into the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The 
retrospect was pleasing, the prospect encouraging. 

In 1840 an immense stride in the study of the drift deposits was made 
through the publication of Louis Agassiz's Etudes sur les Glaciers, a 
work comprising the results of his own study and observations com- 
bined with those of -Ian de Charpentier, E. T. Venetz, 
Agassiz's Glacial anc j y (; Hugi. The work was published in both 

Theory, 1840. => l 

French and German and brought to a focus, as it 
were, the scattered rays with which the obscure path of the glacial 
geologist had been heretofore spasmodically illuminated. But libraries 
in America were few and far between, the workers were poor, and 
many remained long in ignorance of the existence of the treatise or 
gained but a partial and imperfect idea of its contents through hearsay 
or brief reviews in periodicals. 

The prevalent ideas on the subject of the drift have been from time 
to time given in these pages. It was Agassiz's idea, based upon obser- 
vations in the Alps and the Juras, and what was known regarding exist- 
ing conditions in northern Siberia, that at a period geologically very 
recent the entire hemisphere north of the thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth 
parallels had been covered by a sheet of ice possessing all the char- 
acteristics of existing glaciers in the Swiss Alps. Through this agency 
he would account for the loose beds of sand and gravel, the bowlder 
clays, erratics, and all the numerous phenomena within the region 
described which had heretofore been variously ascribed to the Noachian 



AMERICAN aEOLOGY — DECADE OF L840-1849. 365 

deluge, the bursting- of dams, the sudden melting of a polar ice cap, 
or even to cometary collisions with the earth. 

Agassiz's ideas were favorably received by the majority of workers 
in Europe and Great Britain, though there was naturally a highly 
commendable feeling- of caution against their too hasty acceptation. 
As a reviewer in the American Journal of Science has put it: 

These very original ami ingenious speculations of Professor Agassiz must be held 
for the present to be under trial. They have been deduced from the limited number 
of facts observed by himself and others and skillfully generalized; but they can not 
be considered as fully established until they have been brought to the test of observa- 
tion in different parts of the world and under a great variety of circumstances. 

The effect of the publication was, however, soon apparent in Amer- 
ican literature. Thus, in 1839 James Hall, then a young man of 28 and 
just coming into prominence in connection with the geological survey 
of New York, had, with all the confidence of youth, written upon the 
glacial deposits as they had come under his observation. Such he 
regarded as due to water action, but to the action of opposite and con- 
flicting, rather than single, uniform currents. The great extent of 
the deposits and the evidence of long-continued wear shown by their 
materials proved to him that the force which produced them was not 
violent and sudden, but continued for an indefinite period. 

Four years later (1843) Prof. Charles Dewey, writing on the striae 
and furrows on the polished rocks of western New York, argued that, 
while the bowlders of the drift indicated that a mighty current had 
swept from north to south, the polishing and grooving might be due 
to glaciers as described by Agassiz. 

Glaciers or icebergs and the strong current of waters — a union of the two powerful 
causes — probably offers the least objectionable solution of tho^e wonderful changes. 

Though disposed thus to accept in part Agassiz's conclusions, Dewey 
yet failed to realize their full possibilities. He could not conceive 
how it was possible for a glacier to transport sandstone bowlders from 
the shore of Lake Ontario to the higher level of the hills to the south- 
ward. Bowlders of gravwacke removed from the hills in the adjoin- 
ing part of the State of New York and scattered throughout the 
Housatonic Valley furnished a like difficulty, since between the place 
of origin and that of deposit lay the Taconic range of mountains. 
"If," he wrote, '"the bowlders were once lodged on the glacier, the 
ice and bowlders must have been transported by a flood to waters over 
the Taconic Mountains." The Richmond bowlder train, concerning 
which we shall have something to say later, was likewise a source of 
difficulty in his acceptation of Agassiz's theory. 

At the April, 1811, meeting of the Society of American Geologists 
and Naturalists Mr. R. C. Taylor exhibited and described in detail a 
model of the western part of the southern coal field of Pennsylvania. 
This he stated to be the first model constructed in the United States. 



366 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1!)04. 

Such being the case, it is worthy of remark that he regarded the then 
customary (and to some extent still prevailing) habit of exaggerating 

the vertical relief as "a hideous burlesque upon the 
First Geological actual aspect of the district represented or, rather, 

misrepresented," and that he had himself "for some 
time ceased to make any such difference between the horizontal and 
vertical scale. " Ta} 7 lor, it should be noted, was particularly active 
during the period 1831 to 1839, his papers relating almost wholly to 
economic problems and appearing largely in the Transactions of the 
Geological Society of Pennsylvania. His most pretentious publica- 
tion was that entitled Statistics of Coal, a volume of 751 pages relating 
to the coal fields of the world, published in 1818. 

Troost's sixth annual report as State geologist of Tennessee, a 
pamphlet of 18 pages, was made in October, 1811; his seventh, of 15 
pages, in 1813; the eighth, of but 20 pages, in 1815; and the ninth and 

last in 1818. During the interval between his fifth and 
Ten^fesse^TsVi! sixth reports he had become acquainted with the work 

of Sedgwick and Murchison in England, and the result 
is a slight modification of his views regarding the rocks of Tennessee. 
He now announced the conclusion that those rocks west of the line which 
separated Tennessee from the State of North Carolina, and previously 
classitied by him as transition under the names of graywacke, etc., 
belong to Sedgwick's Cambrian system. The range known b} T the 
name of Bays Mountains, which extends into Tennessee for about 100 
miles in a northeast and southwest direction, he believed to terminate 
this system toward the we^t. A few pages farther on he, however, 
thrust a doubt on this determination by writing: 

I consider * * * that Bays Mountain forms the upper part of the Cambrian 
system or that it perhaps belongs to the Old Red Sandstone; that thence toward the 
north of that mountain chain another formation commences, which is the Silurian 
system of Murchison. 

To which of his particular subdivisions they should belong he was 
in doubt. He felt, however, it was possible they might be the equiva- 
lent of Murchison's Llandeilo flags (Upper Cambrian). 

The oolitic limestones and siliceous strata toward the west of the 
Cumberland Mountains he thought to rest upon a continuation of the 
Silurian system, more generally known under the name of "mountain 
limestone.' 1 This he made to extend over the whole of middle Tennes- 
see to a few miles east of the Tennessee River. 

In his seventh annual report he announced that the region about 
Nashville was composed of strata belonging to the Silurian system, 
and mentioned the fossils which he considered as characteristic of the 
lowest strata. In this report he gave a detail colored geological map 
of Davidson. Williamson, and Maury counties.

and species described in what is known as Troost's list of 1850,

together with the unfinished manuscript relating* thereto, passed after 
his death in 1850 into the custody of the Smithsonian Institution, by 
which it was handed over first to Agassiz, and several years later to 
James Hall, to be put into shape for publication. For reasons unknown 
to the public this work was delayed year after year, until, after the 
death of Hall, in his turn (in 1894), it once more came into the pos- 
session of the Institution. In the meantime all that was new had been 
elsewhere described. Thus, through sheer neglect, Troost was robbed 
of much of the credit to which he was justly entitled. 

In 1842 Dr. Edward Hitchcock read an important paper before the 
Boston meeting of the American Association of Geologists on the 
Phenomena of the Drift in North America, which is particularly inter- 
esting at this time as showing the gradual evolution of 

Hitchcock on Drift rt & ~ 

Phenomena in the present theory from that of the Noachian-deluere

idea advocated by earlier writers. Hitchcock s views 
had, of course, been influenced by those of such men as Charpentier, 
Agassiz, Buckland, and Murchison, and he expressed at the outset the 
conviction that nearly all geologists would "agree in the principle that 
the phenomena of drift are the result of joint and alternate action of 
ice and water.'' To express this joint and alternate action he made 
use of the term " glacio-aqueous." 

In this paper Hitchcock devoted some 50 pages to a description and 
discussion of, first, transported bowlders; second, smooth, polished, 
and striated rocks; third, embossed rocks; fourth, valleys or erosion; 
fifth, moraines; sixth, detritus of moraines; seventh, deposits of clay 
and sand; eighth, contortions of the stratified deposits; ninth, terraced 
valleys; tenth, fractured rocks; and eleventh, organic remains, after 
which he proceeded to discuss the theories of the various European 
authorities and state his agreement or objections to the same. He 
objected to the theory of Lyell to the effect that the results observed 
by him in North America were produced by. floating icebergs derived 
from glaciers formed on mountains as the land gradually emerged 
from the ocean, because, first, it failed to account for the lower tem- 
perature which was necessary; second, because there was no evidence 
that the glaciers descended from the mountains; and third, because 
the deposits of vegetable matter derived from land plants showed that 
the continent must have been above sea level long before the drift 
period. The theory of De la Beche, which supposed the contents of 
the northern ocean to have been precipitated over the countries farther 
south by the elevation of the polar regions, Hitchcock regarded as 
possibly applicable to the low countries of Europe, but not to New 
England, since it would require a rise of the ocean amounting to some 
6,000 feet, and he could find no facts to justify such an assumption, 
although recognizing the fact that the aqueo-glacial agency had operated 
well over the summits of the White Mountains. 



3^8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 11)04. 

To Agassiz's theory, which supposed an immense accumulation of 

ice and snow around the poles during- the Glacial period and ;i conse- 
quent sending- out of enormous glaciers in a southern direction, fol- 
lowed by floods of water and transportation of icebergs on return 
of a warmer period, he likewise took exception, since he was unable 
to conceive how such effects con Id be brought about; nor, indeed, 
could he understand how such causes could operate when the land 
was rising from the ocean and the water consequently retreating, as 
it must have been, to account for the various observed phenomena — 
such phenomena as would necessitate the occurrence of water loaded 
with ice and detritus floating for centuries at least over a large part 
of the earth's surface. 

He likewise objected to Maclaren's "ingenious amalgamation" of 
Lyell and Agassiz's theories, but failed himself to suggest one per- 
fectly satisfactory. 

His paper showed a very clear insight into what had taken place, 
but an inability, with the information at that time available, to account 
for it in a satisfactory manner. Thus, in describing the striae found 
by himself on the top of hills and mountains like Monadnoc, he wrote: 

Could immense icebergs have been stranded on the northern slope of the hills and 
afterwards, by the force of currents, have been driven over the summits; or would 
it he necessary to suppose that, after the stranding, the water must have risen so as 
to lift up the iceberg; or would a vast sheet of ice lying upon the earth's surface, by 
mere expansion, without the presence of water, have been able to produce the 
smoothing and furrowing in question? 

He regarded the moraines as deposited by floating icebergs and the 
linear forms observed as identical with the osars of Sweden. The tine 
blue stratified clay, often overlaid by sand, so characteristic of the 
upper valleys of the rivers in the glaciated areas, he regarded as silt 
deposited in temporary lakes formed by the damming of valleys by 
drift materials. After considering the phenomena as observed by 
himself and weighing all the theories advanced from time to time 
by the authorities quoted, he summed up the matter in the following 
words: 

Is it not possible that the phenomena of the drift may have resulted from all the 

causes advanced in the theories under consideration. * * I feel * that the 

proximate cause of the phenomena of drift has at last been determined, namely, 
the joint action of water and ice. 

This is true Hitchcock conservatism. 

In 1842 an expedition under Captain Powell was sent out by the 
Secretary of the Navy to survey Tampa Bay, Florida. Through the 
influence of the National Institute, in Washington, 
Ro n Hda s i8°2 k in T " A - C onraa was allowed to accompany the party for 
the purpose of examining into the geology of the 
region. Conrad remained on the coast sonic three months, his results 
being published in the American Journal of Science for 1846. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY — DECADE OF 1840-1849. 369 

From paleontological evidence Conrad was led to consider the lime- 
stone of the Savannah River in Georgia between Savannah and Shell 
Blurt' as Upper Eocene, and thought that very probably the prevailing 
limestone of Florida would be included in this division. He also found 
evidence to lead him to believe that a considerable post-Pliocene 
elevation of the whole Florida peninsula had taken place, and that the 
Florida keys were a product of this movement. 

At the fourth annual meeting- of the Association of American Geol- 
ogists and Naturalists D. D. Owen read ;i paper on the geology of 
the Western States, including under this designation the region of the 
Ohio Valley. Abstracts of this paper appeared in the 
ai^oTthe the American Journal of Science for 1843. At the Novem- 
wes_tern states, k er (1^42) meeting of the Geological Society of Lon- 
don Mr. Lyell presented for Doctor Owen the same 
paper, which was afterwards published in the journal of that society 
under date of 1846. It seems proper, therefore, that this paper 
should receive consideration here, particularly since Owen attempted 
a correlation of the American rocks with those from Europe. As 
published, the paper was accompanied by a colored geological map

of the Ohio Valley and the generalized section shown in fig. 32. The 
attempts at correlation, it should be noted, were founded on paleon- 
tological data. The limestones immediately underlying the coal (3 of 
the section) he considered to be the equivalent of the European Carbon- 
iferous. These rested upon a series of rocks, the upper one hundred 
feet of which Hall had assigned to the Devonian. The middle and 
lower beds Owen regarded as the equivalent of the English Upper 
Ludlow, as defined by Alurchison. Below this he found shales which 
he believed to be equivalent to the English Low T er Ludlow and the 
New York Marcellus shale. The shale-bearing rock he regarded as 
the equivalent of the Wenlock formation of Murchison. 

The fundamental rocks of the Ohio Valley he considered as the 
equivalents of Murchison's Lower Silurian, the lower 75 to 100 feet 
corresponding to the Llandeilo flags and the rest to the Caradoc sand- 
stones. The corresponding formations of New York appeared to be the 
Trenton limestone and shale, representing the older series, and the 
Salmon River and Pulaski sandstone, the rest. 

Perhaps the most important outcome of the geological surveys of 
Pennsylvania and Virginia and certainly, from a strictly scientific

standpoint, the most important and far-reaching- conclusions, were those 
h. d. andw.B. P 11 * forward by W. B. and H. D. Rogers in a paper 
Appalachian rea d before the Association of Geologists and Natural- 

structure, 1842. ists in 1842 ^ ent i t i ec i Qn the physical structure of the 

Appalachian chain as exemplifying the laws which have regulated the 
elevation of great mountain chains generally. They called attention 
to the fact that the chain consists of a broad zone of very numerous 
ridges of nearly equal height, characterized by their great length, 
narrowness, steepness of slope, evenness of summit, and a remarkable 
parallelism. They divided the chain on topographical and structural 
grounds into nine distinct divisions, consisting of alternating straight 
and curved portions. They noted the remarkable preponderance of 
southeastern dips throughout the entire length, although the general 
trend of the chain was northeast and southwest. This was particu- 
larly characteristic of the portion along the southeastern or most dis- 
turbed portion of the belt, but toward the northwest dips in the 
opposite direction became less steep and more numerous. 

They accounted for the phenomena of these dips by assuming them 
to be due to a scries of unsym metrical flexures, presenting in most 
instances steeper or more rapid arching on the northwest than south- 
east side of every convex bend; and, as a direct consequence, a steeper 
incurvation on the southeast than northwest side of every concave 
turn; so that, when viewed together, a series of these flexures has the 
form of an obliquely undulating line, in which the apex of each upper 
curve lies in advance of the center of the arch. On the southeast- 
ern side of the chain, where the curvature is most sudden, and the 
flexures are most closely crowded, they present a succession of 
alternately convex and concave folds, in each of which the lines of 
greatest dip on the opposite sides of the axes approach to parallelism 
and have a nearly uniform inclination of from 45° to 60° toward 
the southeast. This they described as a doubling -under or inversion 
of the northwestern half of each anticlinal flexure. Crossing the 
mountain chain from any point toward the northwest, the}^ noted 
that the form of the flexures changes; the close inclined plication of 
the rocks producing their uniformly southeastern dip gradually les- 
sens, the folds open out, and the northwestern side of each convex 
flexure, instead of being abruptly doubled under and inverted, becomes 
either vertical or dips steepby to the northwest. Advancing still 
farther in the same direction into the region occupied Iry the higher 
formations of the Appalachian series, the arches and troughs grow 
successively rounder and gentler, and the dips on the opposite side of 
each anticlinal axis gradually diminish and approach more and more 
to equality, until, in the great coal field west of the Allegheny Moun- 
tains, they finally flatten down to an almost absolutely horizontally of

the strata at a distance of about 150 miles from the chain of the Blue 
Ridge or South Mountain. 

This work, so far as it relates to the structure of the chain, has 
been improved upon in recent times only by the discovery of enor- 
mous overthrust faults in the southwestern portions. Their ideas 
regarding the origin of the chain have not, however, so successfully 
withstood the work of the modern physicists. They assumed that 
this difference in the dips was due to a combined undulatory and 
tangential movement of the earth's crust, which was propagated 
from the southeast toward the northwest; that is, they regarded the 
various ranges composing the chain as actually stiffened waves or 
billows of crustal matter comparable to the waves of less viscous mat- 
ter, like water or lava. Their views may be best understood by direct 
quotation: 

We assume that in every region where a system of flexures prevails the crust orig- 
inally rested on a widely extended surface of fluid lava. Let it he supposed that 
Subterranean causes competent to produce the result, such, for example, as the accu- 
mulation of a vast body of elastic vapors and gases, subjected the disturbed portion 
of the belt to an excessive upward tension, causing it to give way at successive times 
in a series of long parallel rents. By the sudden and explosive escape of the gaseous 
matter, the prodigious pressure, previously exerted on the surface of the fluid within, 
being instantly withdrawn, this would rise along the whole line of fissure in the 
manner of an enormous billow and suddenly lift with it the overlying flexible crust. 
Gravity, now operating on the disturbed lava mass, would engender a violent undu- 
lation of its whole contiguous surface, so that wave would succeed wave in regular 
and parallel order, flattening and expanding as they advanced, and imparting a cor- 
responding billowy motion to the overlying strata. Simultaneously with each epoch 
of oscillation, while the whole crust was thus thrown into parallel flexures, we suppose 
the undulating tract to have been shoved bodily forward and secured in its new- 
position by the permanent intrusion into the rent and dislocated region behind of 
the liquid matter injected by the same forces that gave origin to the waves. This 
forward thrust, operating upon the flexures formed by the waves, would steepen 
the advanced side of each wave precisely as the wind, acting on the billows of the 
ocean, forces forward their crests and imparts a steeper slope to their leeward sides. 
A repetition of these forces by augmenting the inclination on the front of even- 
wave would result finally in the folded structure, with inversion in all the parts of 
the belt adjacent to the region of principal disturbance. Here an increased amount 
of plication would be caused, not only by the superior violence of the forward hori- 
zontal force, but by the production in this district of many lesser groups of waves 
interposed between the larger ones and not endowed with sufficient momentum to 
reach the remoter sides of the belt. To this interpolation we attribute, in part, the 
crowded condition of the axes on the side of the undulated district which borders 
the region where the rents and dikes occur, and to it we trace the far greater variety 
which there occurs in the size of the flexures. 

The date of the Appalachian uplift they put subsequent to the for- 
mation of the Coal Measures, as being the final paroxysmal movement 
which terminated "in that stupendous train of actions which lifted the 
whole Appalachian chain from the bed of the ancient sea." 



372 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1004. 

At this same meeting of the Association H. D. Rogers gave an 
important paper on the origin of the coal beds. He here took the 
ground that the singular constancy in thickness of the Pittsburg 
coal bed and its prodigious range were strong^ 
Forniatkftfo* coai, e adverse to any theory of accumulation by drift. His 
idea was that the area now covered by the coal was 
once an extensive flat, bordering a continent, beyond which lay a 
Avide expanse of shallow but open sea; that these low flats were 
occupied by peat bogs derived from and supporting a luxuriant growth 
of Stigmaria, while along the land margin and the drier areas were 
conifers, Lycopods, and tree ferns. The Stigmaria would thus form 
a uniform mass of pulpy peat admixed with leaves and other easily 
transported debris of the trees along the shores, but free from trunks 
and coarse branches. 

To account for the shaly and sandy partings of the coal beds and their 
numerous impressions of plants, he imagined a sudden sinking of the 
land, producing thus a tidal wave from the open sea, carrying destruc- 
tion to the forest growths, and on its return dragging back and spread- 
ing out over the sea bottom, and hence over the accumulated peat beds, 
sand, gravel, and silt, together with floating trunks of trees, all of 
which go to make up the roof slate and other partings in the beds. A 
period of tranquillity followed; another bed of peat accumulated, and 
so on. His theoiy differed from those of Buckland, Beaumont, Lyell, 
and others in excluding from the coal-making materials the trunks and 
branches of the more woody trees and the catastrophic interruptions 
in the growing processes due to earth sinkings and earthquakes. 

He further accounted for the difference in volatile constituents 
between the coal of the eastern and western beds on the supposition 
that the former were debituminized by the action of steam and gaseous 
matter emitted through the crust of the earth and cracks and crevices 
formed during the undulation and permanent bending of the strata, 
resulting in the formation of mountain ranges. 

Prof. W. B. Rogers, at this same meeting of the association, had an 
important paper on the connection of the thermal springs, in Virginia, 
with the anticlinal axes and faults. He recognized the work of the 
European geologists in connecting similar phenomena 
Th'eniiai iprings, with areas of terrestrial disturbance, and then pro- 
ceeded to show that, with but few exceptions, the 
thermal springs of the Appalachian region issue from the steep dip- 
ping or inverted strata on the northwest side of the anticlines. From 
this he deduced the general law that the decidedly thermal springs of 
Virginia issue from the lines of anticlinal axes or from points very 
near such lines. These views he regarded as in harmony with those 
of Arago and Bischoff. From those of Daubeny they differed, seem- 
ingly, in that the latter regarded such springs as indicative of volcanic 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1840-1849. 373 

eruptions going on in a covert and languid manner under certain parts 
of the range. But Daubeny, it must be remembered, carried his views 
to an extreme, regarding the uplift of the chain itself as due to these 
same volcanic forces. 

In 1842 there appeared in the Proceedings of the Boston Society of 
Natural History a paper by J. P. Couthouy, one of the naturalists of the 
Wilkes Exploring Expedition, in which an attempt was made to show 
that the distribution of coral growth in the ocean was 
Corai C arowth y i 8 n 42. limited by temperature. This paper brought forth 
very promptly a reply from Dana, who, while agree- 
ing as to the facts and theories, claimed that he (Couthouy) had simply 
borrowed the idea from him; that the explanation "was originally 
derived from my manuscript, which was laid open most confidentially 
for his perusal while at the Sandwich Islands in 1840." The assertion 
was, of course, denied by Couthouy with equal promptness, but it must 
be confessed that the evidence, so far as it is available, favors Dana's 
claim. 

Dana, it should be remarked, was led, from his observations while 
on this expedition, to agree with Darwin as to the formation of atolls 
(annular coral reefs), but could not agree with him regarding regions 
of subsidence and elevation. He found nothing .which to him sup- 
ported the idea that islands with barrier reefs were subsiding, while 
those with fringing reefs were rising. 

In the summer of 1842 Dr. W. Byrd Powell, of Little Rock, passed, 
of his own volition, some six weeks in a study of the geology of the 
Fonrche Cove region, his results being published in a pamphlet of 23 
Byrd Poweirs work P a » es ana " map, by the Antiquarian and Natural History 
region of A^kaifsasf Society of Arkansas. The Doctor at the time of his 
1842 - writing occupied the position of lecturer on phrenology 

and geology. Whatever may have been his qualification in the first- 
named subject, as a geologist he was no whit above the majority of 
workers of his day. The rocks of the cove and their association were 
described in considerable detail, the prevailing syenite being called gran- 
ite, although he noted that it contained no quartz. He differed with 
Featherstonhaugh, however, in assuming, and wrongly, that the rock 
was primitive and not intrusive. To a supposed transitional form of 
greenstone into basalt he gave the name ( brnean. The other rocks 
noted were basaltic clinkstone, amygdaloid, gneiss, etc. Some of his 
observations are open to question. Less than a gill of mica from the 
gneiss, he announced, yielded him half an ounce of metal, which he 
considered as mostly iron. He further remarked that the hornblende 
rocks of the region contained a large percentage of iron, which was 
chiefly, if not wholly, native; also that they contained native lead and 
a little silver. 

The organization of the geological survey of the State of New York 



374 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

in 1836 has already been noted. Annual reports were issued regu- 
larly during the period of its existence, but with one or two excep- 
tions the results can be best summed up in a review of 
survey of New York, the tinal reports as they appeared in 184:2-4:3. Of 
these tinal reports, which were issued in quarto form, 
Mather's, comprising 639 pages, with 46 plates, in part colored, and 
including a geological map, was one of the most voluminous. 

The tirst geological district, to which Mather was assigned, embraced 

twenty-one counties, extending from the northeast of Washington 

County between lakes Champlain and George southwesterly to the 

Susquehanna River so as to include the counties of 

Ne a w h York Work ta Washington, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, and 

Delaware, and all of the State east and south of this line. 

Mather thought to have recognized seven periods of elevation and 
disturbance of the strata, exemplified in the district assigned to him. 
These he described as follows: 

First. One preceding the laying down of the earliest fossiliferous 
rocks, which gave rise to the primary Highlands of the v Hudson and 
the primary mountains of Saratoga and Washington counties. On this 
he found the Potsdam and Calciferous sandstones and black limestone 
resting unconformably. 

Second. One which preceded the deposition of the Helderberg 
limestone, which he found lying unconformably on the upturned ear 
Her rocks. This manifested itself mainly in the Hudson Valley and 
included the Highlands and Westchester County. 

Third. One subsequent to the deposition of the rocks of the Onta- 
rio division, the effects of which he thought to recognize from Green 
Pond Mountain through Bellevale Mountain, Goose Pond, Sugar Loaf, 
and Skunnemunk Mountains, and along the Shawangunk Mountains. 

Fourth. One subsequent to the deposition of the Catskill division 
and even the coal formation. This disturbed all the pre-existing rocks 
in New York east of the Delaware. To it he ascribed the bending 
and wrinkling of the coal formations in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and 
Virginia. The era of disturbance was regarded as between that of 
the coal and the New Red sandstone. 

Fifth. A period of disturbance at the end of the deposition of the 
Long Island division and before the deposition of the Quaternary. 

Sixth. A period between the drift and Quaternary by which the 
land, without deformation, was lifted to about the level of the Qua- 
ternary formations. 

Seventh. A period after the deposition of the Quaternary by which 
a large part of the land was lifted 100 feet above the level of the 
oceanic waters. 

He thought, also, to recognize four periods of metamorphie agency, 
though, singularly enough, his metamorphism was that of contact by 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1840-1849. 375 

igneous masses only, and hence his periods those of igneous intrusion. 
To the then ordinarily accepted causes of folding, elevation, and 
depression, as steam and elastic vapors in a high state of tension, the 
contraction of the earth by secular refrigeration, or the undulatory 
action of the fluid interior, combined with tangential force — Mather 
added a fourth. He conceived that, as the earth is a cooling and 
shrinking body and revolving with increased rapidity owing to its 
diminished diameter, the ocean, being fluid, would not immediately 
partake of this increased velocity, and, therefore, as the earth revolved 
from west to east, a current of greater or less strength would set to 
the westward over the whole ocean, but strongest at the equator. The 
inertia of the solid mass of the interior of the globe would also cause 
it to press to the westward with a power dependent upon the rapidity 
of rotation. Given, then, lines of weakness where yielding would 
take place, motion and distortion or elevation might follow. If the 
interior were fluid and the solid exterior floating upon it. a change in 
the velocity would produce still stronger effects and changes of lati- 
tude of masses of the earth's surface affected in this way would result. 
Evidences of this were seen in the wrinkled and folded strata. 

Some 75 pages of Mather's report were given up to a description 
and discussion of the phenomena of the drift. He concluded that the 
transport of the drift and the production of scratched surfaces were 
contemporaneous, the drift itself being transported in part by cur- 
rents and in part by ice, itself drifted by the currents. The period of 
the drift and that of the Quaternary deposits were separated by a 
partial submergence of the land; and further, the periods of the drift 
were periods when the currents were stronger than at the present 
time. He conceived this to be due to a collapse of the crust of the 
globe upon its nucleus by refrigeration, causing an acceleration of the 
velocity of rotation, "and this a consequent disturbance of the form of 
equilibrium of the spheroid of rotation, which would be compensated 
by the flow from the polar regions and an accelerated flow of the 
equatorial regions/' This sudden acceleration of the ocean currents 
he felt would be sufficient to cause the transportation of vast quanti- 
ties of detritus-laden ice from the polar regions southward. 

The large amount of drift scattered over the central and northern 
Mississippi region he ascribed incidentally to ice-laden currents from 
Hudson Bay and the polar seas which, flowing over the northern part 
of the United States, would be met by the warm waters of the Gulf 
Stream, causing them to deposit their loads. The warm current flow- 
ing northward would be superimposed on the cold current, the latter 
continuing southward beneath it, transporting the finer materials such 
as now occupy the lower Mississippi Valley. It ma}^ be added that 
Mather's disposition to overload and overwork the Gulf Stream is 
somewhat amusing. Not merely did he ascribe the glacial drift and 



376 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

the New Red sandstone deposits to this agency, but he would have the 
entire sedimentary series of the New York .system dependent on 
the same causes. Thus, writing of these rocks: "And we can perceive 
no region from which such a vast amount of mineral matter can have 
been abraded and washed away * * * unless it has been brought 
by the equatorial and polar currents in their ceaseless flow through 
all time since the ocean has occupied the surface of the earth." Again: 
'"And these depositions seem to have been formed in a kind of eddy 
produced by the meeting of the flow of warm waters of the Gulf 
Stream through the Mohawk Valley with the polar current through 
the Champlain and Hudson valleys. 11 To the presence of this cold 
polar current on the east he attributed also the comparative paucity 
of fossil remains in these rocks when compared with those same hori- 
zons to the west, and to the same joint action of polar and equatorial 
currents, the formation of the coal beds. The equatorial current, he 
argued, performed a circuit around from New Mexico along the 
Rocky Mountains, a part flowing into the polar sea and Hudson Ray 
and the remainder through the northern part of the United States 
and southern part of Canada, where it again divided, one part flowing 
over and through the St. Lawrence Valley and the remainder over the 
Mohawk Valley and along the Blue Ridge around once more to the 
Mississippi, where it would rejoin the same stream, a polar current 
meantime flowing through the St. Lawrence and Hudson valleys to 
the valleys of the Red River of the North and the Mississippi. The 
meeting of these currents at particular points would produce eddies 
and consequent stagnation of the current. The transported organic 
matter, becoming water-logged, w T ould sink to the bottom. This mode 
of formation, he thought, would account for the presence of tropical 
vegetation in the polar regions. 

The white, red, mottled brown, and blue clays and variegated sands 
of Long and Staten islands he regarded as the geological equivalents 
of certain beds of New Jersey underlying the drift and Quaternary 
and of Cretaceous age. The materials he thought to have been derived 
from the breaking down of the gneissic, granitic, and other crystalline 
siliceous rocks which extend parallel to the Atlantic chain from Georgia 
to Maryland and reappear again in Connecticut and Rhode Island, 
extending probably into Massachusetts. This material, to him, bore 
evidence of transport from the southwest, and he believed the Gulf 
Stream, as before, to have been the transporting agent, its velocity 
being checked by the southward-traveling polar current. These cold 
currents sinking to the bottom would not be conducive to growth of 
animal lift 1 , and hence the beds are comparatively nonfossilifterous. 

Mather believed that during the Quaternary division of time a 
vast inland sea occupied the basin of the St. Lawrence and Hudson 
valleys, and that during this time the clays and marls were laid down, 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY — DECADE OF 1840-1849. 377 

the water having only a very moderate flow; that subsequently the 
country was raised en masse to a height of from 300 to 1,000 feet. 
This elevation he conceived to have been sudden, causing - strong cur- 
rents to flow through the channels communicating with the ocean, 
depositing sand, gravel, and bowlders in their eddies. (See further 
on p. 394.) 

He also believed that the limestones, that are frequently crystal- 
line white and variegated marbles in the western part of Vermont, 
Massachusetts, and Connecticut, were metamorphosed forms of the 
Mohawk limestone and Calciferous sandstone; that they were, in short, 
rocks of the Champlain division, but much more highly altered and 
modified by metamorphic agency than Taconic rocks. It should be 
said that, while using the term " Taconic " and describing the rocks and 
their distribution, Mather stated distinctly that he regarded the Cham- 
plain division and the Taconic systems as the "same rocks, the latter 
somewhat modified in character by metamorphic agencies." 

In describing the Taconic rocks separately I have yielded to the opinion of my 
colleagues who have considered them as interposed between the Champlain division 
and the primary. I can discover no evidence of any such interposition, but consider 
them as rocks modified by metamorphic agency and intermediate in their character- 
istics between the unchanged rocks of the Champlain division and those still more 
altered and crystalline along the eastern line of New York and in the western part 
of Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. (See also under. The Taconic Ques- 
tion, p. 659.) 

The trap rocks of the Hudson Palisades he looked upon as ancient 
lavas that had flowed through the rock fissures in dikes while this 
part of the continent was still beneath the waters of the ocean. These 
rocks and the associated red sandstones he rightly believed to be of 
the same age as those of Connecticut, Virginia, and Nova Scotia, 
though he wrongly put down the Lake Superior red sandstone as also 
a contemporaneous deposit, 

Emmons, who had charge of the second district, presented his 
results in a quarto volume of 437 pages, with 17 plates and colored 
sections. It was during this survey that he proposed the name New 
York Transition system for the stratigraphic series of 
N^Tvork. work in rocks extending from the primary up to and including 
the Old Red sandstone, Subsequently this name was 
shortened by the omission of the word transition, and in this form 
was adopted by the other members of the survey. He classified the 
rocks of this system in ascending order as, first, Champlain division; 
second, Ontario division; third, Helderberg division; and, fourth, Erie 
division. The first, or Champlain, division included the Potsdam 
sandstone, the Calciferous sand rock, the Chazy and Birdseye lime- 
stone, the Isle la Motte marble, Trenton limestone, and Loraine shales. 
The second, or Ontario division, included the Medina sandstone, green 
shales, and oolitic iron ore, now known as the Clinton ore, the Onon- 



378 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

daga salt and plaster rocks, and the Manlius water lime. The third 
included the Pentamerus lime, the Oriskany sand, Schoharie grits, and 
Helderberg limestone. The fourth included the Marcellus and Ham- 
ilton shales, the Tulley lime, Genesee slate, and the Ithaca and Che- 
mung slates and grits. 

He regarded the transition rocks of Essex and St. Lawrence counties 
as equivalent to the graywacke series of European authorities. The 
so-called primitive limestone — the peculiar, coarsely crystalline, ser- 
pentinous limestone occurring in Essex County — he conceived might 
be an eruptive rock in which the carbonic acid had been retained by 
the pressure of superincumbent masses, the experiment of Sir flames 
Hall, as he believed, bearing him out in this. The occurrence of 
plumbago he also regarded as favoring the igneous origin of the lime- 
stone, since plumbago is itself so often produced in furnaces. 

He believed the agent of drift transportation to be water and ice. 
The bowlders he thought to be the work of icebergs, but he did not 
regard the st nations and polishing as due to them, since the bottom 
of the ocean is not bare rock but covered by debris; and. moreover, 
icebergs would not move in straight lines (a point which some more 
recent writers have quite overlooked.) The bergs might act as agents 
of transportation, he argued, but not of erosion. According to his 
ideas, the drift-covered region was, during the drift period, depressed, 

the country low and connected at the north with :i wide and extensive region, giving 
rise to Large rivers, which flowed in succession over different parts of the region 
lying between Champlain and the St. Lawrence. These rivers were wide, shallow, 
and swift in some parts of their courses, and frequently found new channels. They 
communicated with the Atlantic on the south through the Champlain, Hudson, and 
Mohawk valleys. They bore along ice loaded with sand, pebbles, etc., which 
scratched and grooved the surface of rocks over which they flowed, and were the 
agents, also, of perforating the rocks in the form of potholes. 

Emmons was, at this time, a catastrophist, going so far as to assert 
that the deep canyons in the Potsdam sandstone, like the An Sable 
chasm, were "opened by some convulsion of nature."" 

It was while connected with the New York State survey that 
Emmonsconceived the idea that a series of obscure rocks, forming a belt 
some fifteen miles wide along the western border of Berkshire County, 
and lying along both sides of theTaconic Mountains, were distinct from 
any of the so-called primary rocks, and lay below those of the New York 
system.' He therefore proposed, on stratigraphic grounds, to raise 
these rocks to the dignity of a system by themselves, which should be 
called the Taconic system. Inasmuch as the controversy which arose 
over this new system raged vigorously for nearly half a century, the 
subject is considered worthy of a special chapter. (See p. 059.)

sisted of little more than an uninteresting account of the geographic

distribution of the various rocks and their fossil contents. In fact, it 
fell short of what one would be led to expect from a 
Newark': 5 work in perusal of his earlier papers. His district, it should 
be noted, comprised the counties of Montgomery, 
Fulton, Otsego, Herkimer, Oneida. Lewis, Oswego, Madison, Onon- 
daga, Cayuga, Cortland, Chenango, Broome, Tioga, and the eastern 
half of Tompkins. 

As a matter of petrographical interest, it may be well to note that 
the serpentine described by Yanuxem [first in his third annual report 
(1839) and last in his final volume (1842)] as occurring near Syracuse, 
and concerning the origin 'of which he was then somewhat in doubt, 
was in 1844 described as an igneous rock, and as the only mass of the 
kind in the vicinity of the Salt Spring. This fact seems to have been 
quite overlooked by Williams in 1887, when, working with all the 
appliances of modern petrography, he showed the rock to be an altered 
peridotite. 

To James Hall was assigned the fourth district in the New York 
State Survey at the close of the first season, as already noted (p. 844). 
This comprised fifteen counties, including all that part of the State lying 
west of the parallel of Cayuga Lake and between Lake 
Yo"k S Work ,n New Ontario on the north and Pennsylvania on the south- 
east. The area includes the least disturbed portions 
of the State, those portions where the rocks lie in a beautiful consec- 
utive series, extending from the Medina up to and including the 
Chemung and affording means unrivaled for the unraveling of the 
stratigraphy of the continent. It is doubtful if, at the time this dis- 
trict was assigned to Hall, he himself realized its possibilities — cer- 
tainly his collaborators did not. Indeed, at the time of Vanuxem's 
transfer and Hall's promotion the region was regarded as one of little 
promise and was willingly relinquished to the youngest and least 
experienced of the force. 

Hall's report, appearing in 1843, comprised 683 octavo pages, with 
19 plates, including a colored geological map of the State and the 
United States as far west as the Mississippi River. 

Hall adopted the term New York system, as suggested by Emmons, 
to include all the oldest fossiliferous rocks of the State, excluding the 
Chemung and Catskill. As denned by him it would be the equivalent 
of what was embraced in the transition of Werner. It likewise 
included Sedgwick's Cambrian. Murchison's Silurian, and the Devonian 
of Phillips, omitting the Old Red sandstone. 

Concerning this he w y rote: 

Nowhere is there known to exist so complete a series of the older fossiliferous 
rocks as those embraced within the limits of the State, and for the reason that in 
New York, where the means of investigation ate best afforded and where the whole 
series is undisturbed, there is manifested the must complete and continuous succes-

sion, showing but one geological era for the deposition of the whole. In that era 
the earth first witnessed the dawn of animal life and ages of its greatest fecundity in 
marine organisms and the approach of the period when it became fitted to support a 
vegetation so luxuriant and universal, of which no modern era has afforded a parallel. 

Hall, it should be noted, in this report, gave precedence to paleon- 
tological characters over all others in distinguishing the sedimentary 
strata, but recognized the fact that lithological characters must not be 
wholly disregarded, a fact to which ho had previously called attention 
(p. 383) 

Changes in the lithological features of a rock * * * which may render obser- 
vations unsatisfactory or doubtful are usually accompanied by greater or less change 
in the nature of the fossils. In no case, therefore, are to he overlooked either of the 
three important facts and characters, viz: Lithological character, order of superposi- 
tion, and nature of the contained fossils. 

At the time of making his report Hall's views regarding the drift 
were still somewdiat hazy. That he did not accept Agassiz's doctrine 
of a vast ice sheet is very evident. Thus he wrote: 

That blocks of granite either enclosed in ice or moved by other means have been 
the principal agents affecting the diluvial phenomena; that they have scored and 
grooved the rocks in their passage and, breaking up the strata and mingling them- 
selves with the mass, have been driven onward, carrying everything before them in 
one general melee. That such may have been the case in some instances or in lim- 
ited localities can not be denied, but that it ever has been over any great extent of 
country will scarcely admit of proof. 

The erratics he felt had been dropped from time to time by ice floes 
and at a period apparently distant from that of the general drift. 

Hall was at this time evidently a eatastrophistand regarded the drift 
soils, terraces, and the deep valleys and water courses as due to the 
violent action of water, which may have been caused in part by a sud- 
den submergence and the rapid passage of a wave over its surface. 
His views were, indeed, in many respects, little, if any, in advance of 
those held by Mitchill twenty-five years earlier. Like Mitchill, he 
conceived of an inland sea bounded by and held back, in this case, by 
the Canadian Highlands on the north, the New England range on the 
east, the Highlands of New York and the Alleghenies on the south, 
and the Rocky Mountains on the west. These presented a barrier of 
from 1,000 to 1,200 feet above the level of the ocean until broken 
through by the St. Lawrence, the Susquehanna, the Hudson, partially 
by the Mohawk at Little Falls, and perhaps also by the Connecticut. 

But, to whatever cause we attribute the phenomena of the superficial detritus of 
the fourth district, the whole surface has been permanently covered by water, for it 
seems impossible that partial inundations could have produced the uniform character 
and disposition of the materials which we find spread over the surface. 

Hall apparently failed at first to realize the efficacy of subaerial ero- 
sion, and thought that the immense amount of denudation which had 
taken place in his portion of the State could only have been accom-

plished beneath the ocean, when it entirely covered the surface of the 
country and was subject to tides and currents like the present ocean. 

Thus we may conceive this whole extent of country to have been submerged 
beneath the ocean for a long period; and that in its subsequent elevation it lias been 
washed by the advancing and retiring waves, which have worn the deep indenta- 
tions in the limestone cliffs and broken up the edges of the strata. 

Hall was born at Hingham, Massachusetts, in LSI 1, and studied under 
Eaton at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, graduating in 1832, after 
which be served for a short time as librarian, and was then appointed 
assistant to Eaton, at a salary of $600 a 3 T ear. 

His first systematic work in geology was done under 
the patronage of Stephen Van Rensselaer in St. Law- 
With the organization of the State geological survey 
in 1836 he was appointed assistant to Emmons, but, after the with- 
drawal of Conrad, was placed in charge of the fourth district — 

the level, uninteresting western portion of the State, 
which be was told was good enough for a young man 
• if twenty-five. The region was not the western New 
York of to-day; mads were less numerous and less 
carefully made; exposures were rare and poor. It 
was necessary to wade along streams for miles to 
gain fragments which were to be pieced into tenta- 
tive sections; the people were suspicions, fearing 
some new scheme for increasing the taxes; but none 
of these things moved him; as in later years, diffi- 
culties only increased his determination. So bis is 
the only one of the four final reports which deals 
broadly with the problems of the young science, 
and, though upon the contemned fourth district, it 
is the only one which has endured with authority 

and become a classic in geological literature. 

1- n.. 33. — James Hall. 

The tinal withdrawal of Conrad from even 
the paleontological work left Hall almost sole master of the field, which 
he for a time tilled so completely that he came to regard it as his own, 
and resented fiercely any intrusion upon his domain. This resentment 
and his desire to gain priority in all matters relative to Paleozoic 
paleontology caused him at times to resort to methods so questionable 
as to rouse the antagonism of nearly eveiy paleontologist in America." 
and subjected him to criticism of the severest kind. Undoubtedly a 
portion of the hatred and opposition to him which early became mani- 
fest was the outgrowth of that peculiar jealous}^ which the poet Riley 
has so aptly set forth in his humorous rhyme: 

And I've known some to lie and wait, 
And git up soon and set up late, 
To find some fellow they could bate 
For gi ling at a faster gait. 

"See Meek's comments relative to Hall's work in Iowa, and also statements on 
p. 367 relative to the Troost collection. 




882 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Much of it was, however, unquestionably fully justified. 

His disposition to down an opponent through sheer weight of per- 
sonal authority rather than by proof or argument sometimes resulted 
iiuplacing him in laughable and awkward positions before his audience, 
but from which he always emerged unembarrassed. Thus it is told 
of him that at the Buffalo meeting of the American Association for 
the Advancement of Science a member rose to question a statement 
of his to the effect that three species of Spirifer characterized three 
zones of the Chemung formation, the gentleman affirming that, so far 
from this being the case, the three species could often be found upon 
one slab, indicating that they belong to the same zone. This Hall 
emphatically denied, and declared that if such a slab could be shown 
him, i. e., with the three species associated, he, Hall, would eat it. 
The next day such a slab was actually produced, though it is not upon 
record that Hall was called upon to redeem his promise. 

He was a man of tremendous physical energy, whom no amount of 
opposition could down, and on the failure of the legislature in 1850 to 
make the necessary appropriations for a paleontological survey of the 
State he carried it on for a time at his own expense, even when this 
involved the sacrifice of his private means. 

Stevenson would have us believe that the fundamental feature of 
HalTs character was "child-like simplicity united to self-contidence 
and indomitable energy." With reference to the last-mentioned qual- 
ities no one will take exception. 

Knowing what he wanted he took a direct line, with little regard fur anybody or 
anything which might be in the way to oppose. * * * He deceived his oppo- 
nents by always telling the truth, something strange to politicians, hut in time they 
came to understand him well, and strong men sought combat simply to measure 
strength, as in gladiatorial contests of olden time. Almost invariably he was victo- 
rious, but victory was often worse than defeat, for it converted into life-long enemies 
men who before had been merely indifferent. * * He held his place for almost 

two-thirds of a century through no favor of man, but solely because he refused to be 
displaced. 

For the benefit of those who, after the science of paleontology was 
well upon its feet, were disposed to claim it as a branch of biology, it 
may be well to remark that with Hall the problems of geology were 
always uppermost. 

His quartos on the New York paleontology are bis monument, and the casual 
observer is liable to see in him a biologist rather than a geologist, but until his later 
years he was a geologist. His studies were from the standpoint of one seeking to 
determine relations between the physical and biological conditions in order to solve 
problems of correlation. The great problems of geology, not those of biology, were 
uppermost in his mind until less than twenty years ago. His presidential address to 
the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1857 (see p. 499), was so 
far in advance of the time as to be thought not merely absurd, but mystical, yet to-day 
it is recognized as one of the most important contributions to one of the most difficult 
problems in physical geology. Even in his later years, when biological problems 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1840-1849. 883 

had assumed their proper importance for him, he would have resented an intimation 
that he was any less of geologist than before. 

Fifteen quarto volumes, comprising 4,539 pages and L,081 full page 
plates of fossils, stand as an enduring monument to his industry, u 
record which never has, and presumably never will be, surpassed in 
the annals of American geology." 

In 1841 Hall, fresh from his work on the geological survey of New 
York, made a tour through the then western State of Ohio to the 
Mississippi River, with a view of furthering the work of Vanuxeni in 
1829 relative to the identity of certain of the western 
Hairs work in Ohio, formations with those of New York. As a result, he 
claimed that the rocks seen near Cleveland were "per- 
fectly identical with those of tin 1 middle portion of the Portage group," 
and that the rocks of tin' Chemung group, now known to be Waverly, 
appeared near Newbury and Akron. The Clin 1 ' limestone of the Ohio 
geologists he regarded as the equivalent of the Helderberg series of 
New York, or at least of the Onondaga and Corniferous members/' 
Perhaps the most important of his generalizations was the following: 

From the facts here stated, the conclusion seems unavoidable that the character 
of fossils is, or may he, as variable as lithological characters; in fact, that the species 
depend in some degree upon the nature of the material among which they lived. 
fossil characters, therefore, become of parallel importance to the lithological; and, 
in order- to arrive at just conclusions, both must be studied in connection, and local- 
ities of proximity examined. In the case of the Hudson River group of shales and 
sandstones, in passing from New York to Ohio the lithological character is almost 
entirely changed, and at the same time also the most prominent and abundant 
fossils are unlike those of the group in New York. More careful examination, how- 
ever, reveals the fossils which characterize this group at the East, and also at the 
same time some obscurely similar lithological characters. Similar lithological changes, 
accompanied by like changes in fossils, occur in more limited districts within the 
State of New York. Without desiring to diminish the value of fossil characters as 
means of identifying strata, it must still be acknowledged that similar conditions in 
the lied of the ocean, and, apparently, similar depth of water, are required to give 
existence or continuation to a uniform fauna; and when we pass beyond the points 
where these conditions existed in the ancient ocean, we lose, in the same degree, the 
evidences of identity through successive depositions, often of very different nature; 
yet, at the same time, these may not have had a very wide geographical range. 

" Prof. Charles Schuchert informs me that if to the above are added his miscella- 
neous publications in octavo the number of pages of text published during his life 
may safely lie set down as not less than 10,000. Large as are those figures, they 
were, however, exceeded by the celebrated Bohemian paleontologist Barrande, who 
issued during his life is quarto volumes, comprising 5,568 pages of text and 798 
plates of fossils, besides leaving manuscript and material for at least 10 volumes 
more, of which 4 have been issued since his death. 

& At that time, the Corniferous, Schoharie, Cauda-galli, Oriskany, and the 
Onondaga, or Salina and Waterlime, were considered subdivisions of the Upper and 
Lower Helderberg. 



384 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

He further wrote: 

One of the most interesting changes in the products on going westward is the great 
increase of carhonate of lime, and the diminution of shaly and sandy matter, indi- 
cating a deeper ocean or greater distance from land. The source of the calcareous 
deposits is thus shown to have been in that direction, or in the southwest, while the 
sands and clays had their origin in the east, southeast, and northeast, producing a 
turbid condition in the waters of these parts during long intervals, and the formation 
of chemical deposits. In New York we are evidently upon the margin of this primeval 
ocean, as indicated in the character of the deposits as well as organic remains; the 
southwest unfolds to us that portion where greater depth and more quiet condition 
prevailed. 

This is apparently the first clear enunciation by an American geolo- 
gist of what are now generally recognized as well established geologi- 
cal principles. 

It was but natural that Hall, while geologist of the fourth district of 
New York, should write concerning Niagara and its gorges. The 
views of Bakewell, Rogers, and Hayes have been already noted in 
these pages. Hall in his State report (1841), but more 
Concerning Niagara, in detail in the Boston Journal of Natural History for 
1842, covered the ground in a manner much more 
thorough and scientific than an}' of his predecessors. 

Hall announced at the outset his disagreement with Doctor Dau- 
beny," who considered that the terrace or escarpment at Lewiston was 
produced by a fault, as he found no evidence whatever of even the 
smallest disturbance. 

He noted the abrupt change in the direction of the stream at the 
Whirlpool, and also the gravel-filled channel extending from this point 
to St. Davids, but, singularly enough, failed to realize that this may 
have been the one-time channel of the Niagara. He felt, rather, 
that this ravine was excavated by the power of the waves of the sea, 
aided probably by a stream which may have been of very insignificant 
proportions. 

The fact was, however, recognized that the river was at that time 
carving out its own channel, and the existing gorge from the falls to 
Lewiston was due to the same cause. 

In 1841, after several years of agitation, there was established a 

geological survey of Canada, of which W. E. Logan was put in charge 

in the spring of 1842, the sum of £1,500 being appropriated for the 

purpose of carrying out the work. During the season

In the various sections given the vertical distances are grossly 
exaggerated, and the rocks piled on top of one another without any 
evident consideration of their original position; nor is there in the 
text any indication that the author considered at all the problems 
relating to original horizontality, uplift, and erosion. The red sand- 
stone associated with the New Jersey traps (Triassic) he considered as 
Old Red, but the impressions of fossil lish that had been reported as 
found therein he regarded as rather from overlying beds— from "one 
of the upper members of the Coal Measures which lie above it." 
The Triassic conglomerate of Maryland and Virginia was also inci- 
dentally referred to the Coal Measures. This seems a little strange 
when we consider the previous work of his collaborators, Redfield and 
Hitchcock. 

It is stated in his preface that the work was first undertaken for his 
own amusement and study, and it is possible that his intluence can not 
be gauged simply by this one publication." 

In 1843, also, there was published b} 7 By rem Lawrence a geological 

map and descriptive pamph let of the Western States. This was designed 

for popular use, and was claimed to be the first attempt of its kind.

of his survey, in the form of a small volume [of 120 + 55 pages],

Cozzens, he gave the results of later observations by himself in the 75 to 100 miles 
of artificial sections exposed since Cozzens' s time. He showed the island to be a 
portion of the main land of Westchester County cut off by a profound fault. The 
rocks enumerated were chiefly gneiss, which he considered metamorphosed Taconic, 
cut by granite, and interbedded with limestone.

fall line of the rivers was occupied by granitic rocks and their residual 
soils. 

The first attempt at a systematic geological survey of South Caro- 
lina was inaugurated in 1844 with the appointment of Michael Tuomey 
as State geologist. The first report, an octavo pamphlet of 45 pages 
with an appendix, was submitted in November of the same year. This 
was devoted mainly to economic considerations, and, aside from a few 
notes on rock weathering, contained little of general interest. His 
final report, which appeared in 1849, will be noted later. 

Tuomey was born in Ireland in 1805, and went to England when 
about 17 years of age, shortly afterwards coming to America. He 
lirst settled near Philadelphia, going thence to Maryland, where he 
served for a time as a tutor in a private family. He 
sketch of Tuomey. entered the Rensselaer school in New York, and after 
graduation went South, serving first as an engineer on 
a railway in North Carolina and afterwards as a teacher in Virginia. 
His love for natural history led him to make 
collections of fossils, which brought him in 
contact with Sir Charles Lyell, James Hall, 
J. D. Dana, and others, and he shared with 
Rogers the honor of discovering the infuso- 
rial beds near Richmond and Petersburg. 

In 1844 he became State geologist of 
South Carolinia, as already mentioned, and, 
in 1847, was appointed professor of geology, 
mineralogy, and agricultural chemistry in 
the University of Alabama; in 1848 receiv- 
ing in addition the appointment of State 
geologist. As a teacher Tuomey is repre- 
sented to us as possessing in a remarkable 
degree the faculty of interesting the student, 

those, even, who took no particular interest in the subject-matter of his 
lectures. His native Irish wit did much to render his lectures enter- 
taining, especially to those who were not the victims of it, he being 
particularly unmerciful in his rebukes and exposures of shams and 
affectations. 

His most important publications are his official reports on the geol- 
ogy of South Carolina, and his joint report with Dr. F. S. Holmes, of 
Charleston, on the Pliocene fossils of that State, the latter of which 
appeared in 1855. 

Prior to the introduction of the microscope and the study of rock 
structures by means of thin sections (about 1870) views regarding 
metamorphisin, particularly such as are due to sheering stresses in 
the older crystallines, were naturally somewhat vague. With rocks 
too line of grain to allow a determination of their structure and mineral 
composition by the unaided eye, only mode of occurrence could be

Metamorpnism, aspect into massive eruptives ot the same ultimate com- 
position that a feeling of doubt began to arise in the 
minds of observers regarding the assumed sedimentary origin of the 
gneisses and crystalline schists. 

It was during this prematinal period, as Rogers might have termed 
it, that J. D. Dana came out with a suggestive paper in the American 
Journal of Science on the analogies between the modern igneous rocks 
and the so-called Primary formations and the metamorphic changes 
produced by heat in the associated sedimentary deposits. The con- 
clusions arrived at were based upon observations made during the 
Wilkes exploring expedition, and the exciting cause of a paper at this 
time would appear to have been the somewhat varying views recently 
put forth by Lyell. 

Dana argued that: (1) The schistose structure of gneiss and mica 
slate was not necessarily an evidence of sedimentary origin; (2) that 
some granites having no trace of a schistose structure may have had a 
sedimentary origin; and (3) that the heat producing metamorphism 
was not applied from beneath by conduction, but was rather due to 
heated waters of the ocean which permeated the rocks. As confirma- 
tory of the first he called attention to the parallel arrangement of the 
minerals and the consequent platy structure, with a tendency to split 
along certain lines, which were sometimes found in volcanic and other 
igneous rocks. The possibility of a schistose structure due to dynamic 
(shearing) causes was not, however, suggested. 

His argument for the possible metamorphic origin of certain gran- 
ites was based upon the fact that some of the basaltic tuffs observed 
by him in the Andes and in Oregon had become so indurated that their 
fragmental origin was almost wholly obscured. He felt that if rocks 
of this type could be so remodeled or rehardened as to be scarcely dis- 
tinguishable from the parent rock, sedimentary deposits of granitic 
origin might undergo a like change. 

His argument against metamorphism by dry heat was enforced by 
calling attention to the low conducting power of stone, which is such 
that heat, even to the point of fusion, may be transmitted only a few 
inches. "Lavas may be heated to a red heat within a }^ard of the sur- 
face and still be so cool above that the bare foot may walk upon them." 
lie believed that subterranean waters or water on sea bottoms might 
become so heated by " volcanic tires"' as, on permeating the rocks, to 
bring about the metamorphism. This, of course, would mean that the 
gneissic rocks were not necessarily deep seated (hypogene), as held by 
Lyell, but analogous to other rock formations deposited and solidified 
at or near the surface. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGT — DECADE OF 1840-1849. 389 

In a paper read before the fifth session of American Geologists and 
Naturalists in 1844, Prof. Edward Hitchcock described a trap tufa 
differing 1 . from "common trap" in being conglomerate and apparently

scoria, ashes, and melted matter falling oyer the bottom of the ocean, 
where it became admixed with sand and gravel. After this layers of 
sandstone accumulated over it, and finally the main ridges of trap were 
protruded through the strata, tilting them up. 

He regarded the dip of the sandstone in the vallej" as due in part to 
elevation by the protrusion of the trap and in part to the lifting aud 
lateral movements of the adjoining primary ridges. He felt, however, 
that the sandstone might have been originally deposited on a slightly 
inclined plane. This last view brings up a matter which seems often 
to have seriously troubled the earlier geologists, and which, so far as 
the literature shows, was never solved for itself, but became lost sight 
of as other and satisfactory means of accounting for the phenomenon 
were observed. This relates to the inclined position of strata how 
much of it was due to original deposition and how much to upheaval. 
Cleaveland, it will be remembered, in his work on geology and 
mineralogy. L816, expressed a doubt as to whether the inclined posi- 
tion of strata was original or due to some powerful cause which had 
elevated them from horizontally. Maclurein 1825 suggested that the 
dip, so far as the transition rocks were concerned, might result from 
their having been laid down on a primitive floor, concerning the posi- 
tion of which nothing was known. Hitchcock, it will be noticed, with 
his usual caution, felt that both causes might have been instrumental 
in producing the dip observed. 

At the same session at which Hitchcock read the paper noted above, 
Benjamin Silliman, jr., presented a report On the Intrusive Trap of 
the New Red Sandstone of Connecticut. His conclusions were to the 
effect that the sandstone was let down from suspension in water in 
the inclined position which it now occupies and that it had suffered no 
change in dip, excepting in immediate connection with the injection 
of the trap rocks. He considered it probable that the strata were 
deposited by a primeval ocean current setting from the southwest and 
west. Subsequent to this accumulation and consolidation the lower 
primary rocks were disrupted, the igneous rocks injected through the 
fissures and distributed along the lines of least resistance in the sedi- 
mentary strata — that is, along and up the plane of the dip, thereby 
lifting the strata parallel to the clip from the beds on which they had 
before reposed. At the same time there were produced in the upper 
strata fissures and transverse cracks which were filled with the molten 
trap. This injection he thought was probably continued during a

long period, but all referable to the «tuie geological epoch and anterior 
to the elevation of the strata in which it occurred. 

After the deposition and injection ceased and the elevation of the 
present continent had commenced, denudation, induced by a northerly 
current, set in, the current itself being due to the flowing off of the 
oceanic waters incidental to the elevation of the present continent. 
Ify this denudation the soft shales and other materials were removed 
and the trap ridges developed. Thus, deposition, intrusion, uplift, 
and erosion were all included within a single epoch. 

Early speculations regarding the origin of the earth, though largely 

fanciful, were founded upon the brief outline of a series of events as 

chronicled in the first chapter of Genesis. Theories regarding earth 

development and its probable destiny other than its

punishment tor sinful man, were slow to appear. 
When such did appear, however, they were founded upon a much 
more scientific basis. 

That a mutual reaction was going on constantly between the super- 
ficial portions of the earth and its surrounding atmosphere was doubt- 
loss realized by all of those who wrote on the weathering of rocks and 
the formation of soils; but. so far as known to the present writer, II. I). 
Rogers was one of the first of American geologists to show by direct 
calculation that the earth had been in the past, as at present, robbing 
the atmosphere of some of its constituent parts and gradually storing 
them up in its solid crust/' 

At the Washington meeting of the American Association of Geolo- 
gists and Naturalists in May, 1844, Professor Rogers submitted a com- 
munication on the probable constitution of the atmosphere at the period 
of the formation of the coal. He estimated that the amount of carbon 
existing in the atmosphere to-day in the form of carbonic acid would 
be only sufficient to furnish through vegetable action about 850,000,000 
tons of coal, while the probable quantity of this substance in existence, 
all of which must have been elaborated from the ancient atmosphere, 
was nearly 5,000,000,000 tons; that is to say, about six times what the 
present atmosphere would produce. So great a reduction in the car- 
bonic acid, implying a corresponding augmentation of oxygen, is felt 
to be a matter of great interest in geology, as showing that every modi- 
fication in the constitution of the air had adapted it to the development 
of animals progressively higher in the scale of organization. 

Of all the New England States Vermont was the last to become 
infected with a desire for a geological survey, and it was not until 

«Vanuxem in 1827, while connected with South Carolina College, pointed out the 
probable change in the atmosphere during geologic time through the absorption by 
the earth of nitrogen ami oxygen, and also the probability of a warm, moist climate 
during the period of coal formation. (American Journal of Science, XII, 1827.)

LS44 that the final .steps were taken resulting in the appointment of 
Prof. C. B. Adams as State geologist. Adams was educated at Phillips 
Academy and Amherst College, and subsequently attended the theo- 
logical seminary at the last-named place. In 1836 he 
ni Ve^IIt! ia44. rk became a tutor at Amherst and for a brief period was 
assistant to Professor Hitchcock in his work on the 
geological survey of New York. When appointed State geologist of 
Vermont he selected Zadock Thompson as his chief assistant, Denison 
Olmsted, jr., and later T. Sterry Hunt aiding in mineralogy and chem- 
istry. Rev. S. R. Hall, of Craftsbuiy. was employed to look after 
the agricultural features. Up to March. 1848, the survey continued 
in a fairly prosperous condition, a large amount of material being col- 
lected, both in the way of specimens and notes, but at the session of 
the legislature for this year appropriations were for sonic reason with- 
held and the work stopped. Four reports in all were issued, the last 
a mere pamphlet of eight pages. 

The purpose of the surve}^, as stated in 
the first report, was to collect and analyze 
the soil, the simple minerals, both of eco- 
nomic and scientific importance, and to 
make investigations into the character and 
limits of the geological formations. The 
reports on the whole were extremely frag- 
mentary. Doctor Adams dying before the 
manuscript of the final report was pre- 
pared, a large part of his work was lost, 
this mainl} T owing to the fact that he took 
his notes in a "peculiar shorthand, which 
onl} T he could read.-' As suggested b}' Pro- 
fessor Thompson, it would have required 
more labor to decipher his notes than to go over the ground anew. 

The second annual report was prepared — as was not infrequently 
the case at that date — in the form of a general treatise on geology, 
and began with an elementary chapter which dealt with all subjects 
relating to geological phenomena, whether applicable to the State or 
not. The views advanced were those given by the text-books of the 
period and need not be mentioned in detail. An ideal section from 
the first report is, however, reproduced here as illustrating equally 
well the rough method of picture making with which the early work- 
ers had to content themselves and the crudity of ideas relative to the 
earth's crust and interior. He would, indeed, be regarded as a novice 
in geology to-day who would not at first glance inquire what supported 
the mass of solid material represented as resting upon the molten lava, 
yet this question does not seem at this time to have even presented 
itself for consideration. A little space was devoted to tin 1 subject of

the connection between geology and the Bible, to meet the wants of 
the "many well-meaning persons'" who were disturbed by a supposed 
incongruity between the principles of geology and the Mosaic narra- 
tive. A ver}^ abstruse explanation of concretionary structures was 
offered, Adams failing, as did many of his contemporaries, to discrimi- 
nate between concretionary structure as it is now understood, and cer- 
tain forms assumed by igneous rocks and due to contraction in cooling. 
Thus he considered columnar structure in basaltic rocks as a peculiar 
form of concretion which was due to lateral pressure such as might 
exist between spheres compressed at the sides. 

Agassiz's glacial theories had been apparently without effect, even if 
they were known, and icebergs were considered as sufficient to account 
for all the phenomena of the drift.

In 1847, the year before the closing of the survey, Adams had 
accepted a professorship at Amherst, and in 1853, in conjunction with 
Alonzo Gray, published as a text-book an Elements of Geology, a 
duodecimo volume of 350 pages. Here his geological work seems to 
have ceased. Indeed, from the date of the abandonment of the State 
survey he devoted himself mainly to zoology, and particularly to 
conchology, making large collections especially rich in West Indian 
and Central American forms. While at St. Thomas, on one of his 
collecting trips, he contracted yellow fever, from which he died in 
1853. He is described as a man of sturdy build, medium height, with 
large, black eyes and black hair. A man of tremendous physical 
endurance, knowing neither fear nor what it was to be tired; but, 
withal, a quiet and self-contained demeanor. 

Thompson, Adams's chief assistant, is represented to us as a man 
poor in this world's goods as well as in general health, and modest 
almost to a fault — one who from childhood had shown a passion for 
writing books. His first publications were almanacs, which he him- 
self sold while traveling on foot about the country. It is told of him

that when at one time interrupted by his clerk with an inquiry as to 
the prediction that should be made in the forthcoming issue for the 
weather for July, he replied somewhat testily. "Say 
'Snow about this time.'" So it stood in the printed 
almanacs, as issued from the press, and, to the aston- 
ishment of all, including both printer and author, snow did fall in 
Vermont that year in the month of July. 

The industry of the man was remarkable. He graduated from the 
University of Vermont at the age of 27. He published an arithme- 
tic, a geography and map of Canada for use in the common schools; 
became in 1832 editor of the Green Mountain 
Repository; wrote a history of Vermont, 
which appeared the same 3 r ear ; studied theol- 
og}', and took deacon's orders in the Protes- 
tant Episcopal Church in 1836. He preached 
for a time and returned once more to his 
book writing, first publishing in three vol- 
umes a Natural, Civil, and Statistical History 
of Vermont; then a text-book on the Geol- 
ogy and Geography of Vermont; finally 
becoming an assistant to Professor Adams 
on the State survey in 1845, when his geo- 
logical work really began. 

■"Tall, angular, of a very quiet and sedate. 
yet very pleasant, manner, a man of most 
amiable and sweet temper, loved by all who knew him, and respected for 
his sound sense and accurate judgment.' 1 Such is the picture given us 
of him, who certainly was one of the most remarkable men of his times 
although his name may not stand the highest in the annals of geology. 

Under the caption of " Description of a singular case of dispersion 
of blocks of stone connected with the drift in Berkshire County, 
Massachusetts," Dr. Edward Hitchcock described in the American 
Hitchcock's Journal of Science for 1815 a remarkable train of gla- 

RfchmondBowider cial bowlders extending from Fry's Hill in the Canaan 
Train, i84s. Mountains, of New York, southeasterly into Massa- 

chusetts for a distance of some 15 or 20 miles. 

The lithological nature of the bowlders was such that the}' could all 
be traced to a common source, though described as forming three 
somewhat meandering trains extending from Fry's Hill above men- 
tioned, through the adjoining valley, and upward over an elevation of 
800 feet at the State line, across the Richmond Valley and over Len- 
nox Mountain, 600 feet in height, to and over Beartown Mountain, 
1,000 feet in height. 

Naturally, so striking a phenomenon excited investigation, and. 
naturally, too, Doctor Hitchcock, in the then existing condition of

knowledge regarding" glacial transportation, found difficulty in account- 
ing for the same. He recognized the similarity of the trains to the 
lateral glacial moraines described by Agassiz in his Etudes sur les Gla- 
ciers, which had appeared five years previously, but could not con- 
ceive of a glacier traveling directly across the intervening ridges, even 
were the mountains in the vicinity of sufficient altitude to give rise to 
the same. Neither did the consideration of river drift or floating ice 

afford him a satisfactory 
conclusion. "In short, 
I find so many difficul- 
ties on an}^ supposition 
which I may make that 
I prefer to leave the case 
unexplained until more 
analogous facts have 
been observed. " 

Unsatisfactory and ap- 
parently unimportant as 
the paper may, at first 
thought, seem, it is men- 
tioned here on account 
of the extraordinary ex- 
planation .of the phe- 
nomenon offered hy the 
Rogers brothers three 
years later (see p. 403). 
In the American Jour- 
nal of Science for 1845 
W. W. Mather, whose 
work in New York and 
Ohio has been already 
mentioned, published a 
paper on the physical 
geography of the United States in which' he still further elaborated 
some of the interesting and rather unique ideas regarding the origin

Mather again argued on the basis that the earth is a cooling body, 
contracting, and hence undergoing an increased velocity of rotation 
upon its axis. The oblateness of its spheroidal form, due to the 
increase of centrifugal force, would therefore induce a flow of water 
from the polar to the tropical regions, and as the earth revolved from 
west to east these currents from the poles would bend more and more

to the westward as they advanced to lower latitudes. On the other 
hand, the water in the Tropics, being gradually expanded through 
heat, would tend to flow off toward the polar regions. 

These currents he regarded as having acted throughout all the time 
since the ocean occupied its present bed, and to them he would ascribe 
the mechanical distribution of many of the sediments making up the 
Secondary rocks. Considering only those currents that constitute the 
Equatorial, the Gulf Stream, and the Labrador Current in the Atlantic, 
he thought to show that the materials constituting the immense mass 
of sedimentary rocks between the primary ranges north of the Great 
Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico, and between the Blue Ridge and the 
Rocky Mountains, were deposited within the great eddy due to their 
interference. 

The red sandstone formations extending from Carolina to Stony 
Point on the Hudson he believed to have been formed through the 
transporting power of the Gulf Stream, its northward extension hav- 
ing been cut off by a polar current flowing through the Champlain 
and Hudson River valleys. The loosely consolidated material now 
classed as glacial drift he seemed also to regard as having been trans- 
ported and deposited through the same agency. The coal beds of the 
eastern and central portions of the United States he regarded as formed 
at the bottom of the ocean in which great eddies occurred, and where 
plants brought from the Tropics and other sources would Moat and circle 
about until they sank. He noted that these beds were based upon a 
sandstone which at the outcrop of its edges on the coal basins was 
much coarser and sometimes a conglomerate or coarse pudding stone, 
while through the center of the basins it was much finer. This fact 
denoted to his mind a stronger current on the exterior of the coal basins 
than within its area. 

Concerning the regions over which the polar currents were supposed 
to have flown, and from whence, as a consequence, were derived the 
materials for the sedimentary rocks, he could say little from actual 
observation. Drawing for his materials mainly on the writings of 
travelers, though acknowledging that such might be faulty, he never- 
theless pictured a scene of barrenness of the entire region north of the 
St. Lawrence and Great Lakes and from Newfoundland to the Stony 
Mountains such as is equaled only by that given by II. II. Hayden in 
his attempt to account for the deposits of the coastal plain (p. 250). 

Although the quotations from travelers lack that accurate examination that is nec- 
essary to a determination whether the surfaces thus described have been exposed to 
the action of violent and long-continued currents, yet they have their weight. When 
considered in connection with the effects of known physical causes, it is rendered 
more than probable that the currents under consideration have flowed from the 
polar regions toward the equator and from the Tropics toward the poles when this 
continent was beneath the ocean, and that the matter which composed the deposits 
of the sedimentary rocks of the United States was washed away by these great equi- 



396' REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

libriating currents from the bed of the ocean, from reels, islands, and coasts, and 
finally deposited from suspension over the great area where we now find it expo&ad 
to observation. 

The probable cause of the elevation of the land he thought to be 
secular refrigeration accompanied by contraction, whereby a gradually 
accumulating tension was finally overcome by a yielding of the solid 
strata, such being regarded as paroxysmal and productive of earth- 
quakes. At the same time a sudden increase of the velocity of the 
earth's rotation would result, and this in turn would increase the flow 
of the ocean currents above mentioned. 

In attempting to account for the overturned character of the folds 
in the mountain chains of the eastern United States, he seems to have 
actually outdone the Rogers brothers in fecundity of ideas. He wrote: 

Paroxysmal elevation and the action of inertia offer a satisfactory explanation of 
the folded axes and eastwardly dip. Suppose the sudden elevation of a mountain 
mass one mile in height, or more distant from the axis of rotation than it was before 
its elevation. It would still retain the linear velocity it had when a mile nearer the 
axis of rotation, while the proper linear velocity at this increased distance would be 
;; ■ !]' "' miles, or 690 feet greater per hour than that which it had before its elevation. 
Inertia would- therefore cause the mass at the top to press to the westward with a 
force proportional to its mass and the above-mentioned velocity, and at intermediate 
heights with a proportionally less momentum. If the strata he capable of yielding, 
they must, when elevated in highly curved wrinkles, tend to fall over westward as a 
consequence of the influence of inertia and the revolution of the earth from west to 
east on its axis. 

Such a view from a man of Mather's training and at this late date 
certainly seems extraordinary. 

Commenting further on the effects of centrifugal force, particularly 
upon bodies of different densities, he argued that as such is greatest 
under the equator, any subterranean force tending to elevate portions 
of the earth's surface by their elastic tension would here be most 
effective. In this way he would account for the supposed fact that 
most of the highest mountains are found within the Tropics. Reason- 
ing along the same lines, he conceived it possible that fractures might 
be expected to develop in the direction of circles parallel to the equator 
at a distance intermediate between it and the poles, where the curva- 
ture resulting from the revolution of the earth would be greatest. 

In continuation of his work begun in 1832. T. A. Conrad in 1845 issued 

his volume on the Medial Tertiary formations, the general plan of the 

work conforming closely to those which we have already considered 

(pp. 306, 320, and 354). In this latter work he de-

very extensive depression in the Cretaceous rocks, the

The nature of the country, its strata, and fossils were described in 
detail. The most interesting- part of the paper, from our standpoint, 
lies in his remarks on the theory of elevation and the age of the 
deposits. He regarded the formation of each Tertiary division and 
the final annihilation of its fauna as a very gradual operation, taking 
place in quiescent waters and having no connection with volcanic 
agencies or any violent movements of the earth's crust, but merely 
depending on changes of temperature. 

In discussing the effects of these temperature changes he showed 
some peculiar ideas regarding the conductivity of rock musses and the 
effects of cooling. The cold penetrating deep into the igneous rocks 
beneath the surface, he thought, would result in a maximum amount 
of crystallization and expansion," producing thereby a slight eleva- 
tion of the crust. Since the cold penetrated gradually, he argued that 
the elevation would also be gradual, more appreciable, of course, dur- 
ing epochs of unusual cold. In brief, erustal elevation, he would 
have us believe, was induced not by volcanic agency, but by "the all- 
powerful and pervading influence of crystallization in the primary 
rocks. " In this he followed what he calls the "sublime" theory 
advanced by Vanuxem. The idea that the abrupt change in the char- 
acter of the animal life at the close of each geological epoch by a sud- 
den fall of temperature was, however, avowedly the theory of Agassiz. 

In connection with work pertaining to the Liberian Colonization 
Society, in 1845-1848, David Christy traveled extensively throughout 
the eastern and middle United States. Being a man of active mind 
David Christy's and with a love for the sciences, he made many geo- 
obse°rvaUons, logical observations which were first embodied in a 

series of letters to Dr. John Locke and published in 
the Cincinnati Gazette. These were afterwards issued (in 1848) in 
pamphlet form, some 70 pages, with 5 plates of fossils and three geo- 
logical sections: the first from Mine La Motte and Pilotknob, Mis- 
souri, to Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania; the second from Lake Erie to 
Pensacola Bay, and the third from Richmond, Indiana, through 
Oxford, Ohio, to Beans Station, Tennessee. 

It is impossible to say what portion of the information given in 
these letters can be claimed to be strictly the result of original inves- 
tigation or observation. As stated by Locke in his introductory note, 
he "referred the geological formations to the Blue Limestone of Cin- 
cinnati as a kind of zero, informing us whether the rocks at any place 
are above or below that zero." Locke further states that he knew of 
"no other individual who has actually drawn approximate sections of 
the strata from the Atlantic to Iowa and from Lake Erie to the Gulf 
of Mexico; most of this work being the result of his own observations." 

In a letter addressed to M. de Verneuil in 1847, relative to the

erratic rocks of North America, Christy showed himself to have been 
a catastrophist. He believed that there had been two periods of ele- 
vation of the land in the history of the continent, with an intervening- 
submergence. The second and last emergence he regarded as having 
been .rapid and to have given rise to the swift currents which were 
instrumental in producing the drift. 

In the spring of 184:6, A. Wisiizenus, a " German by birth and an 

American by choice," left St. Louis, Missouri, with the intention of 

making a tour through northern New Mexico and upper California 

for the purpose of examining into the ffeoefraphy and

nately tor his intentions, war between the United 
States and Mexico broke out while he was within the jurisdiction of 
the Mexican Government, and he was compelled to remain within the 
State of Chihuahua for a period of six months or until the arrival of 

the American troops, when he accepted a 
position in the medical department and re- 
turned with it by way of Monterey to the 
States. 

His opportunities for observation were, 
naturally, much less than was at first antici- 
pated, and his geological report, amounting 
to but five pages, was published as a part of 
Senate Miscellaneous Document No. 26 of 
the thirtieth Congress, first session. In this 
report he noted that the bluffs on the Arkan- 
sas some 341 miles from Independence were 
of a grayish conglomerate limestone, con- 
taining fossils which tk seemed to belong to 
the Cretaceous formation." Near Las Ve- 
gas he found a dark blue limestone with casts of Jnoceramus, which 
were also relegated to the Cretaceous series. Near El Paso he noted 
the presence of a limestone containing the fossil coral Calamopora and 
the bivalve shell of the genus Pierinea, which, as a consequence, he 
considered as belonging to the Silurian formation. The presence of 
numerous eruptive rocks were noted and an outline map published, 
in which the lithological nature of the rocks was indicated. The map, 
it should be noted, comprised the area lying between the Arkansas 
and the Rio Grande rivers, but extended south and west of the latter 
as far as Montere} r and Chihuahua. 

The fine silt-like character of the superficial deposits 
fhe "oessMTb ° n of the Mississippi Valley had frequently been noted by 
the various geologists who passed over the region, but 
it remained for Amos Binney, tin 1 conchologist, to give the first rea- 
sonably satisfactory account of its probable origin. At a meeting of

the Boston Society of Natural History in April, 1846, Binney exhibited 
a collection of fossil shells from the so-called Bluff formation at 
Natchez, on the Mississippi, and announced the belief that the forma- 
tion was analogous to the Loess of the Rhine Valley and a result of 
fluviatile action rather than attributable to the glacial drift. 

In 1847 J. D. Dana, who from the beginning of his career had shown 
a disposition and ability to grasp the broader, more profound ques- 
tions of geology, came forward with two papers which were beyond 
question the most important of the year. The first of

Features of the involved the acceptation on his part of the prevailing 

theory that the earth was once in a condition of igne- 
ous fluidity. After a full discussion of the subject and the views held 
by others, Dana announced it as his belief that the now oceanic areas 
were atone time the most intensely heated portions of the crust, and 
had, therefore, on cooling undergone the greatest amount of contrac- 
tion, and that, further, the mountain ranges and main fissures along 
the oceanic borders are due to this same contraction. Such a theory, 
he felt, did away with the almost preposterous though prevalent idea 
that continents and mountains have been lifted up by a force acting 
from beneath, a force which could not be satisfactorily located and 
accounted for; a theory which would not account for the mountains 
retaining their positions, even did it offer satisfactory explanation for 
their first production. 

He showed, further, that the folding and faulting of the strata as 
described by the Rogers brothers in Virginia and Pennsylvania could 
be readily accounted for on the theory of a force acting laterally, and 
that such folds w T ould have their steepest incline on the side farthest 
from the source of movement and would also be most abrupt nearest 
this source. The fact that such results were not in all cases uniform, 
he conceived as being due to variation in the thickness of the beds, to 
a want of uniformity in the materials, and inequality in the action of 
the force upon the different parts of the line along which it operated. 

The geological epochs were regarded, as announced in this same 
paper, as perhaps due to the alternation of prolonged periods of quiet 
with those of more or less abrupt change, due to contraction. The 
idea that mountains might be produced by tides and paroxysmal move- 
ments beneath the crust (as advocated by H. D. Rogers) was set aside 
on the ground that such should have occurred at earlier periods, and, 
further, it would not account for the principal ranges in the east and 
west of the continent. In many of the views he here advanced Dana 
agreed with those previously advanced by the French geologist Prevost. 

In the second paper referred to, on the Grand Outline Features of 
the Earth, Dana argued "that the great chain of mountains, as well as 



400 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

of islands, are interrupted ranges consisting of overlapping lines, 
either straight or curved, and that curves constitute an essential feature 
of the system." He showed that throughout the system of outlines 
presented by the earth northwest and northeast lines are prevalent, 
and that these lines are usually curved, instead of conforming to the 
direction of a great circle. He apparently accepted the theory that 
the course of mountain ranges, islands, and coast lines is attributable 
to the courses of former fissures in the earth's surface, and, in discuss- 
ing the electrical, contractional, and other theoretical causes, suggested 
that if, as claimed, curves of magnetic intensity on the earth's surface 
are approximately isothermal lines, they must also be lines of equal 
cooling and hence of equal contraction and tension. But whatever 
may have been the origin of the fissures, he thought there could be no 
doubt but that a kind of cleavage structure, or at least capability of 
fracturing easily in two directions, was given the crust during its 
formation. 

The conclusions which appear to flow from the facts that have been presented are 
as follows: 

That the general direction and uniformity of the grand outline features of the globe 
may be in a great degree the simple effects of the earth's cooling, this operation 
resulting in (1) solidification, and under the circumstances, whatever they were, an 
attendant jointed structure or courses of easiest fracture, in two directions nearly at 
right angles with one another, both varying according to the rates of cooling in dif- 
ferent parts; and (2) occasioning tension in the crust through the contraction going 
on beneath, with some relation to circular areas, but especially to large compound 
areas, which tension caused ruptures conforming or not to the lines of jointed struc- 
ture according as the force of tension acted in accordance with this structure or 
obliquely to it. (3) The age of mountains can not, therefore, be determined neces- 
sarily by their courses; a different direction in a particular region in different ages is 
not improbable, since the same contracting area might exert its horizontal force in 
somewhat different directions at different epochs, or other such areas might cooperate 
and exert a modifying influence; and at the same time an identity of direction for 
different ages was to have been expected. 

Prof. James I). Dana was born in Utica, New York, in 1813, and was, 

therefore, practically contemporaneous with James Hall. He became a 

student of Professor Silliman's in 1830 at Yale College, leaving in 1833, 

somewhat in advance of graduation, to avail himself 

sketch of j. d. Dana, of an offer to cruise in the Mediterranean, as instructor 

in mathematics to the midshipmen in the Navy. 

The first paper in his bibliography was published in 1835 and gave 
an account of Vesuvius as seen by him during this trip in 1831. In 
1836 he returned to New Haven, remaining for two years, the latter 
part of the time as assistant to Professor Silliman. It was during this 
time, scarcely four years after his graduation and when but twenty- 
four years of age, that he brought out his first System of Mineralog\ r ,

a volume of 580 pages, and a most remarkable work for the time and 
the conditions/' 

From 1839 to 1842 Professor Dana served as geologist and mineralo- 
gist on the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, and for the first thirteen 
years after his return devoted his chief energies to the study of the 
material collected on the expedition and to the preparation of his 
reports, of which two — the volume on geology, 756 pages, 5 maps, 
and 21 plates (1849), and the one on crustaceans, 1,620 pages, with an 
atlas of 96 plates (1854) — are monumental. His labors, however, were 
not limited to the reports, for during the same period he prepared and 
issued three editions of the System of Mineralogy (1844, 1850, 1854) 
and two editions of the Manual of Geology (1848, 1857), besides writ- 
ing numerous papers for scientific periodicals. 

Tn 1846 Mr. Dana became an editor of the American Journal of 
Science, associated with Prof. Benjamin Silliman, who had founded it 
wenty-eight } T ears before. His labors in 
connection with the Journal continued until 
the close of his life. In 1850 he was ap- 
pointed professor of natural history in Yale 
College, and in 1864 the title was changed 
to that of professor of geolog3 T and miner- 
alogy. His duties as instructor, however, 
he did not take up until 1855, but after this 
date, with some interruptions due to ill 
health, his active connection with the college 
continued until 1890. It is perhaps well to 
add that just before his appointment to 
Yale in 1850 he had been invited to a simi- 
lar position at Cambridge, Massachusetts, 
in connection with Harvard College, but by 

the prompt action of a generous friend in the Yale faculty in provid- 
ing the necessary funds he was induced to remain in New Haven and 
accept the "Silliman Professorship.' 1 

In 1859 long-continued overwork brought a breakdown of serious cnaracter and 
from which he never fully recovered, and although later some degree of health came 
back, he was always subject to the severest limitations until the end of his life. Only 
those immediately associated with him could appreciate the inexorable character of 
these limitations and the self-denial that was involved, not only in restricting work 
and mental effort, but also in avoiding intercourse with other men of science and 
friends in general, in which he always found the greatest pleasure. Little by little 

«The "System" has now gone through six editions, though after 1868 the work 
was done mainly and finally wholly by his son, Prof. E. S. Dana, now professor of 
Physics and Curator of the Mineralogical Collection in the same university. The 
last edition, that of 1892, comprises 1,104 royal octavo pages with over 1,400 figures 
in the text.

the power for work was restored and by husbanding his strength so much was accom- 
plished that, besides other writing, he was able to bring out in 1862 the first edition 
of his Manual of Geology, and in 1864 the Text-book of Geology, and four years later 
his last and most important contribution to mineralogy, the fifth edition of the 
"System." This last great labor, extending over four years, was followed by a 
turn of ill health of an alarming character and from which restoration was again 
very slow. 

The years that immediately followed were rilled with the same quiet labor, geo- 
logical investigations in the field, the writing of original papers and books, the 
editorial work of the Journal, and his duties as a college instructor. 

They were remarkably productive years, notwithstanding- the diffi- 
culties contended against, notably bis renewed illness in 1874 and 1880. 
A large number of important papers were published, chietry in the 
Journal. New editions of the Manual of Geology were issued in 
1874, 1880, and 1895; of the Text-book in 1874 and 1883; while a new 
geological volume called The Geological Story Briefly Told was issued 
in 1875, and one on the Characteristics of Volcanoes in 1890, after his 
second visit to the island. A second edition of his book on Corals and 
Coral Islands, the first edition of which appeared in 1872, was also 
brought out in 1890. 

But it was not as an investigator and writer only that Dana achieved 
success. As a teacher he seems to have won the respect and regard 
of all with whom he came in contact, and to have left on the minds of 
students — even those who had no taste for geology — a lasting and 
favorable impression. Many of his sayings in class lectures were 
epigraphic: "1 think it better to doubt until you know. Too many 
people assert and then let others doubt." Again, "1 have found it 
best to be alwa^^s afloat in regard to opinions on geology. " 

Nor can we regard him as merely a geologist. His work on crus- 
taceans, comprising 1,620 pages, with an atlas of 96 plates (1854), 
shows that equal success could have been attained in the biological 
Held had he chosen to follow it. The mental vigor and staying powers 
of the man were simply extraordinary, and it is not too much to say 
that he stands out head and shoulders above all his contemporaries, if 
not above all who preceded him. His interest nev T er flagged; no 
problem was too large for him to grasp, no detail too small for his 
consideration. 

It would seem quite extraordinary that two men who have done so 
much for American geology, whose work was really epoch making, 
who, without doubt, excelled any geologists of their time in ability to 
h. d. and w. b. unravel the difficult structural problems of any region, 
Richmond Bowlder should have been so extremely visionary in theoretical 
Train, 1848. matters. The peculiar ideas of H. D. Rogers on the 

subject of the elevation of the Appalachians are elsewhere referred to. 
I wish here to notice their equally extraordinary ideas regarding the

Berkshire (Richmond) bowlder train, first brought to notice by Hitch- 
cock (see p. 394). 

According' to the descriptions now given, the trains start, each from 
its particular depression in the summit of a high ridge, in Canaan, New 
York. Taking a direction S. 35° E M they cross the higher ridges and

their intervening valleys, the longer for a distance of 20 miles and the 
shorter for 1<> miles. The individual trains are neither of them more 
than 300 or 400 feet in breadth, and not over half a mile asunder. 
The transported blocks are of all sizes up to 20 feet in diameter, 
sharply angular, free from scratches, and all of the same lithological 



404 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, t904, 

nature, identical with that of the ridge from whence they start. That 
such a dispersion of bowlders from a single point should have taken 
place regardless of contours is certainly enough to excite the interest 
of .anyone. It is the means invoked by the two workers which have 
excited our wonder, however. 

After exhibiting to their own satisfaction the inadequacy of either 
the iceberg or the glacial hypothesis to account for their production, 
the authors, in a paper before the Boston Society of Natural History 
in 1848, attempted to show how all the phenomena might be explained 
by the theory of a sudden discharge of a portion of the Arctic Ocean 
southward across the land. The}^ discussed the important functions 
of the "wave of translation," showed its surpassing velocity and great 
propulsive power, and traced the influence of vehement earthquakes 
near the pole in dislodging the northern waters and ice and maintain- 
ing in the rushing Hood these vast and potent waves. They then sug- 
gested that, at a certain stage of the inundation, the ice, previously 
floating free, might impinge with irresistible violence against the tops 
of submerged hills, and that the Canaan Mountain stood precisely in 
the position to take the brunt of the ice-driving flood as it swept down 
the long, high slope of the distant Adirondack and across the low, 
broad valley of the Hudson. 

They then proceeded to show that, at the instant when some enor- 
mous ice island struck the crest of the mountain and scooped the 
trench which we there behold, a great vortex was produced by the 
obstruction thus suddenly thrown in the path of the current, which, 
endowed with an excessive gyratory or spiral velocity, was capable of 
sustaining and carrying forward the greater part of the fragments. 
As in the instance of the water spout and the whirlwind, the whirl- 
pool would gather into the rotating column the projected blocks and 
strew them in a narrow path in the line along which its pendent apex 
would drag the ground. 

The paper terminated with an application of this idea in detail, to 
the explanation of each important feature of these trains; to their 
deflection from a straight line; the intermission in the bowlders at cer- 
tain places in the train, and the fact that some of the blocks have been 
violently broken at the moment previous to their final deposition/' 

Truly there were catastrophists in those days. 

We may anticipate here by stating that at the meeting of the Ameri- 
can Association for the Advancement of Science in 1870, Prof. J. B. 



«In 1852 the English geologist Lyell visited this region in company with James 
Hall, the former's views on the subject being published in 1855 in the Proceedings 
of the Royal Institution. He regarded the hypothesis of glacial transportation as out 
of the question, and apparently also that put forward by the Rogers brothers, for he 
made no mention of it. His own idea was that the large erratics had been trans- 
ported to their present resting place by floating coast ice.

Perry read a paper on glacial phenomena, in which he referred to these 
trains incidentally, and argued that they were part of the true glacial 

drift — morainal material deposited by the melting of 
rde°a f s J i8 B 70 Perry ' s the ice sheet of the glacial epoch. 

Again, in 1878, Mr. E. R. Benton studied the trains 
in considerable detail, and in the Bulletin 
of the Museum of Comparative Zoology 
published a detailed description and map 

of the region, from which 

E.R. Benton's Work, the Qne ffiyen herewith IS 

reproduced. Benton took 
the ground that the bowlders were de- 
posited by the ice sheet of the glacial 
period at the time of its final melting, 
the direction of the stria? on the under- 
lying rocks being here essentially the same 
as that of the bowlder trains. In con- 
nection with his investigations, Benton 
wrote to Prof. W. B. Rogers concerning 
the views above advocated by him, and 
received in reply the letter from which the following abstract is taken: 

At that time (i. e., when this paper was written) paroxysmal dynamics had still 
many advocates, and the attempted explanation may he interesting as a specimen of 
the hold type of speculation in which some of the early geologists sometimes ventured 
to indulge. But, for myself, I may say that long years of observation and study make 
me more distrustful of our knowledge of causes and more willing, in geology as in 
other things, to labor and wait. 

It will be remembered that in 1844 Michael Tuomey was appointed 

State geologist of South Carolina, a position which he continued to 

hold until his appointment to the chair of geology, mineralogy, and 

agricultural chemistry in the State University of 

Tuomey's Final « i i 

Report on the Geology A la Dama. 

i848 U ar ° ma ' A preliminary report has already been noted (p. 387). 

The final report appeared in the form of a volume of 
293 pages in 1848. This, with the exception of the volume on the 
fossils of South Carolina, of which he and Doctor Holmes were joint 
authors, was the most systematic and pretentious of his publications. 
This survey, like that of many of its predecessors in other States, 
was undertaken with a view of developing the agricultural resources 
of the State. The condition of the public mind toward pure science 
at the time is well reflected in the almost pathetic postscript of Mr. 
Tuomey to his preface, in which he simply states that, while the 
report was passing through the press, he was informed that the plates 
containing figures of fossils had not been considered essential by the 
committee on publication and were therefore omitted. The work 



406 REPORT OF NATIONAL MiTSEUM, J904.. 

comprised: (1) Aii introduction of 59 pages, given Up, as was so often 
the case with these eariy reports, to general geological considerations 
and as applicable to any other region as that at hand, and (2) the 
report proper, comprising seven chapters (234 pp.) and an appendix 
of 56 pages, containing a catalogue of the fanna of the State. It also 
contained a geological map of the State, the first to be issued. 

The introductory chapters are interesting only as reflecting the con- 
dition of geologic knowledge at the time. Tuomey estimated that our 
actual knowledge of the earth's crust extends to a depth of 15 miles, 
measured from the tops of the highest mountains. He adopted the 
Kant-Laplacean theory of the origin of the earth, and recognized 
slaty cleavage as distinct from joints and stratification, regarding it as 
resulting " from the tendency of the simple component substances of 
the rock to arrange themselves in crystalline forms at a time when 
the semifluidity of the mass permitted a certain degree of motion 
among its particles. ,, The crystalline structure of the gneisses and 
other metamorphic rocks he regarded as resulting from a degree of 
subterranean heat which, although intense, did not destroy the lines 
of st ratification or bedding which they received at the time of their 
deposition. In his table showing the order of superposition of 
fossiliferous rocks, he divided them into: (1) The Recent or post- 
Pliocene period; (2) the Tertiary; (3) the Newer Secondary or Creta- 
ceous; (4) the Middle Secondary, including the Wealden and Lower 
Lias with the intermediate beds; (5) the Older Secondary, including 
the Triassic; (6) the Newer Paleozoic, extending from the Magnesian 
Limestone or Permian down to and- including the Lower Carbonifer- 
ous shales; (7) the Middle Paleozoic, including the Devonian; and (8) 
the New York S}'stem of Upper and Lower Silurian, including the 
Chemung and Champlain Division and intermediate formations. 

In the part of the report relating to the geology of the State proper 
were chapters on the character of the surface rocks, beginning with a 
discussion of the granites and traps. Attention was called to their 
extensive decomposition, and the production of bowlders through 
decomposition along joint plains is described and figured. The occur- 
rence of the flexible sandstone, or itacolumite, was noted, and it was 
rightly remarked that "the flexible portions of the rock seem to be in 
the incipient stages of disintegration." The gold and iron mines 
received a considerable share of attention, and a map was given show- 
ing in color the deposits of magnetic, specular, and limonite ores, and 
limestone of the York and Spartanburg districts. 

In the line of purely physical local geology, perhaps the most 
interesting part of the report lies in his discussion of the possible sub- 
sidence of the coast going on at the present time. He showed, to his 
own satisfaction at least, that the presence of stumps of trees below 
and partly below the present sea level was due to the gradual under- 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1840-1849. 407 

mining - of sand and mud flats on which they grew and the consequent 
settling of the stumps, retained in an upright position by their wide- 
spreading roots, and not to a subsidence of the coast, as taught by 
Lyell, Bartram, and later by Lieber and Cook." The origin and nature 
of the soils, the mining and preparation of fertilizers, including lime 
burning, the washing and milling of gold ores, and kindred subjects, 
were touched upon. Many soil and fertilizer analyses were given, the 
latter and their discussion being largely by Prof. C. U. Shepard, then 
professor of chemistry in the Medical College of the State, at Charles- 
ton. The fossils were identified by Conrad and Gibbs. 

It is but natural that a considerable portion of the work should be 
given up to a discussion and description of the Tertiary deposits, which 
cover more than half the area of the State. Concerning these he 
recapitulated as follows: 

1. That they are situated in a vast depression in the Cretaceous rocks, which, 
however, are only visible on the east and northeast. 

2. That the Eocene consists of three well-defined groups: (1) The Buhr-stone 
formation, composed of thick beds of sand, gravel, grit, clay, and buhr-stone, amount- 
ing to at least 400 feet in thickness and underlying the calcareous beds. Its upper 
portions are characterized by beds abounding in silicified shells, for the most part 
identical with the Claiborne fossils. As these are littoral shells, they probably 
occupied the coast while the Santee beds were forming in deep water. The materials 
of which this formation is composed are the ruins of the granitic and metamorphic 
rocks of the upper districts, which may often be traced to their origin. (2) The 
Santee beds, consisting of thick beds of white limestone, marl, and greensand. 
These are best seen on the Santee, where, interstratified with the greensand, they 
dip gently toward the south. The coralline marl of Eutaw is found near the upper 
edge of these beds. (3) The Ashley and Cooper beds, which are the newest Eocene 
beds of the State. The marl of these is characterized by its dark gray color and 
granular texture, while the remains of fishes and mammalia give its fossil remains a 
peculiar character and leave no doubt of the position assigned it — at the top of the 
Eocene series. These, together with the Santee beds, must amount at least to a 
thickness of 600 or 700 feet, 

3. That although these strata contain throughout characteristic Eocene fossils, yet 
they also inclose some Cretaceous forms. 

4. That the Middle Tertiary of the State, composed of beds of sand and mail, 
highly fossiliferous, is scattered, like similar beds in other places, over the Eocene 
and Cretaceous formations in isolated patches. That the proportion of recent species 
increases toward the south, and that the extinction of species seems to proceed in 
that direction, as is proved by the fact that the recent forms, which are also fossil, 
belong to a more southern fauna, there being but one or two exceptions. 

5. That in South Carolina the proportion of recent species in this formation amounts 
to 40 per cent. I have, therefore, referred it to the older Pliocene. 

6. That the post-Pliocene is confined to a belt along the coast of about 8 or !» 
miles in breadth. The fossils are nearly al»l referable to living species now inhabit- 
ing the coast; a few, however, belong to the fauna of Florida and the West Indies. 
An elevation of the coast has taken place since the deposition of these beds, which, 
it is probable, has given the rivers of the Atlantic slope a w r estern tendency. 

"Tuomey's view wasupheld by Prof. N. S. Shaler as recentlyas 1870. Proceedings 
of the Boston Society of Natural History, XIII, p. 22S. 



408 REPORT OB 1 NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

7. That the submerged stumps of trees found below the level of high tide along 
the coast are not the result of subsidence, properly so called, but must be referred to 
the encroachment of the sea upon the land and to the peculiar character of the 
deposits in which they grew. 

8. That the almost entire absence of fluviatile shells in the recent and Tertiary 
deposits is mainly due to two facts: (1) That there is a considerable space between 
the line of brackish and salt water, where neither fluviatile nor marine forms can 
exist; (2) that the streams have not transporting power sufficient to bring down 
fresh-water shells. So long as these circumstances exist, there can be no mixture of 
fluviatile and marine shells. 

Prior to 1848 the professor of geology in the State University of 
Alabama had been required to spend a portion of his time, not exceed- 
ing - four months of each year, in making geological explorations in 
the State. ' In January, 1848, the general assembly, in 
Alabama!* 1848-50° recognition of the utility of this work, passed a resolu- 
tion appointing Michael Tuomey, then holding this 
professorship, State geologist, and requiring him to make a report to 
the general assembly at each of its biennial sessions. Thus simply was 
inaugurated the first systematic geological survey of the State. 

Under this law, Tuomey's First Biennial Report, in form of an octavo 
volume of 176 pages and a colored geological map of the entire State, 
appeared in 1850. In this the rocks of the State were divided into 
those of (1) The Primary, (2) Metamorphic, (3) Silurian, (4) Carbon- 
iferous, (5) Cretaceous, and (6) Tertiary systems, the last named being 
represented, so far as then known, only by the Eocene. Much of 
the report was taken up with economical considerations, particular 
attention being paid to coal and iron. 

The second report of this survey appeared under the editorship of 
J. W. Mallet, the publication having been delayed through the pro- 
crastination of the Public Printer and Professor Tuomey's death, which 
occurred in March, 1857. 

. Tuomey recognized on Marble Creek in Limestone County a blue 
limestone which was a continuation of the Silurian rocks in Tennessee. 
The Devonian rocks were represented by black slate found on the 
principal streams flowing from the north into the Tennessee between 
Flint River in Madison and Shoal Creek in Lauderdale County. He 
regarded the divisions of the carboniferous made by Troost as suffi- 
ciently characteristic in north Alabama to be retained. 

The clastic material — that is, the loosely consolidated sands and 
gravels — which he mapped as extending across the middle of the State 
and north of the verge of the Cretaceous beds, and colored as post- 
Tertiary, were referred to as belonging to the drift, although having 
little resemblance to that of the north. "If the southern drift be at 
all connected with that of the north," he wrote, k 'itmay be explained 
by supposing that the northern glaciers suddenly melted, and that the 
water thus liberated in immense volume took a southern direction, 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY— DECADE OF 1840-1849. 409 

caifying With it the debris torn from the surface over which it passed 
Until it met the Tertiary sea, upon the shores of which its burden was 
deposited.' 1 This theory, he felt, would sufficiently account for that 
enormously long - ridge of drift extending parallel with the Atlantic 
coast, for the moment the current entered the Tertiary sea its velocity 
would be checked and the greater part of the transported detritus 
deposited. The reader will here recognize an old idea, but slightly 
modified. 

Commenting on the fact that these beds contain no fossils, he wrote: 

The only way by which I can account for this * * * is by supposing that, 
before the drift period, the bottom of this sea had been elevated and converted into 
dry land, and that at the commencement of the drift period a depression of the land 
took place; that the time between the influx of the sea and the deposition of the drift 
was too short for marine animals even to have commenced a colonization, and that the 
land was again elevated into its present position and subjected to long-continued 
denudation, which produced its present configuration ; that after this elevation the 
rivers excavated their present channels. 

Tuome} T was assisted in this work by Oscar M. Lieber, geologist, 
and J. W. Mallet, chemist. 

The withdrawal of Tuomey from the held in South Carolina inci- 
dental to his removal to Alabama left the position of State geologist 
vacant until the appointment of Lieber, in 1855. In the meantime 
F. S. Holmes, working privatelv, gave in the American 

F. S. Holmes on the '. , te l . „• 

Geology of Charleston Journal of Science for 1849 a brief paper on the p - eol- 

and Vicinity, 1849. ... ™ , . , 

ogy of the vicinity or Charleston, which ma}*- be noted 
here, with the preliminary remark that this was Doctor Holmes's first 
venture in the geological field. In this paper attention was called to 
the fact that the city of Charleston was built upon geological forma- 
tions supposed to be identical in age and in other respects similar to 
those upon which London and Paris are located, i. e., upon the Eocene. 
The adjacent sea islands he thought to have been formed through the 
action of the ground swell of the ocean and the streams flowing down 
from the interior during the time when the land was gradually emerg- 
ing from the sea. 

He agreed with Tuomey in taking exception to the then g-enerally 
received opinion that the sea was advancing upon these shores, having 
been led b} r his own observations to the conclusion "that if the ocean 
does wash off portions of the shore at one exposed point it deposits the 
same at no great distance upon another.' 1 The supposed indications 
of subsidence, such as the stumps and roots of trees now below the 
level of high tide, he accounted for on the supposition that outer sand 
barriers, which had prevented the ingress of salt waters, were gradu- 
ally removed, allowing the waves to wash away the fine silt and mud 
between the roots of the trees, thus permitting them to sink into it 
and become embedded. This, it will be noted, was essentially the view 
advanced by Tuomey.

Holmes classified the formations met with as post-Pliocene, Miocene 
and Eocene, the post-Pliocene, where observed, resting directly upon 
the Eocene. This he would account for on the supposition that during 

the deposition of the 
post-Pliocene the Mio- 
cene areas were above 
water, or had been de- 
nuded of their post- 
Pliocene covering- pre- 
vious to the deposition 
of the alluvial or dilu- 
vial sands and clays. 

In 1849 Capt. Howard 
Stansbury, of the corps 
of topographical engi- 
neers, acting under au- 
thority of the War De- 
partment, explored the 
valley of Great Salt 
Lake. The expedition 
left Fort Leavenworth 
May 31, 1849, taking a 
north-

and striking the Platte 
at Fort Kearney, pro- 
ceeding thence along 
this and the North Fork 
to the Sweetwater, and 
thence across South 
Pass to Fort Bridger 
and Salt Lake City. 
The return trip was 
made by a more south- 
erly route , through 
Bridger Pass, striking 
the old route again at 
Fort Laramie, and 
thence back to Fort 
Leavenworth, the latter 

point being reached the 6th of November, 1850. 

No geologist accompanied this expedition, and a small series of rocks 

and fossils which were collected were reported upon by James Hall. 

Forms belonging to the Cretaceous. Carboniferous, and Silurian or 

Devonian ages were identified.

In 1817 Doctor Owen was again employed by the Treasury Depart- 
ment, under immediate supervision of General Land Commissioner 
R. M. Young, to make surveys in the Chippewa district of Wisconsin 
d.d. Owen's work in and the northern part of Iowa. The region lies between 

the Chippewa District , , 

and in Wisconsin, 4:3 and 4 i north latitude and 89 and 94 longitude

miles and, as shown on the map (fig. 45), comprising that portion of 
the country ''lying chiefly east of the upper Mississippi above Lake 
Pepin and extending north to Lake Superior.*" Incidentally, there 
was included a portion of Iowa "stretching north from the northern 
boundary of the geological survey of 
1839 as far as the St. Peters River, 
and also a tract of country north of 
the Wisconsin River." 

As in the previous survey, the 
time was limited, only the summer 
and autumn of 1847 being devoted 
to field work, the report, printed in 
form of Senate Document No. 57 
of the first session Thirtieth Con- 
gress, bearing the date of Apri 1 23, 
1848. It comprised 134 pages, with 
one geological map, 23 lithographic 
plates from drawings by Doctor 
Owen, and 13 colored plates of sec- 
tions. Some of these last were 
beautiful combinations of sections 
and perspective landscapes, and give 
at a glance a general idea of the 
surface features as well as the 
character and dip of the underlying 
rock masses, such as is randy ex- 
celled. (See Plate 19, from his sec- 
tion 5.) Even when one considers 

that, as Owen states, the working time of the members of his corps 
was from twelve to fifteen hours a day, still one wonders that so much 
was accomplished and presented in such good form. Though a detailed 
geological survey was made of only about thirty townships west of the 
fourth principal meridian on Black River and sixty townships on the 
St. Croix, sufficient data was obtained to enable him to lay down with 
approximate accuracy the general I tearing and area of the principal 
formations of over two-thirds the area above noted. He showed, also. 
that both the upper and lower magnesian limestone, were lead-bearing, 
and that there existed in Wisconsin two, if not three, trap ridges simi- 
lar to those of Michigan, and which, like the last, "hold out a prospect 
of productiveness. "

that the Fulls of St, Anthony are receding and were probably at one 
time at a point near Fort Snelling.

Concerning the red sandstones of the south and west shores of Lake 
Superior, he wrote: "There is strong- presumptive evidence that they 
were deposited subsequently to the Carboniferous era." His evi- 
dence, though, was admittedly weak and later was acknowledged to be 
wholly misleading and insufficient. 

This preliminary reconnaissance ended. Owen was instructed to make 
a survey of the Northwest Territory, embracing chiefly Wisconsin, 
Iowa, and portions of Minnesota. The manuscript of his final report 
of this work was submitted in 1851 and published under date of 1852 
in the form of a quarto volume of 628 pages of text, with 15 plates of 
fossils, 19 folding sections, and a geological map. The illustrations of 
the fossil remains are of particular interest, being medal-ruled on 
steel, the first of their kind produced in America. 

Owen was assisted in this survey by Doctors Shumard and Litton, of 
St. Louis; Dr. John Evans and F. B. Meek, of Owensboro, Kentucky; 
Col. C. Whittlesey, of Cleveland, Ohio; and Messrs. B. C. Macy, Henry 
Pratton, George Warren, and John Beale, of New Harmony. Indiana. 

To Doctor Leidy fell the work of describing the vertebrate fossils 
collected by Doctor Evans in the Bad Lands of Nebraska. Among 
these fossils was the now well-known Oreodon, an animal with grind- 
ing teeth like the elk and canines like those of omnivorous thick- 
skinned animals, belonging, as was thought, to "a. race which lived 
both on flesh and vegetables and yet chewed the cud like our four- 
footed grazers." 

This work was the first S3^stematic account published of the Bad 
Lands fossils. The first mammalian remains to be described from this 
region, it should, however, be noted, consisted of fragments of the 
jaw of an enormous pachyderm, which were described by Dr. H. A. 
Prout, of St. Louis, in the American Journal of Science for 1847. 

Owen regarded the gypsum deposits of Dubuque as due to original 
deposition at the bottom of an ocean, the sulphate of lime having 
probably been derived during the formation of the rocks and from sub- 
marine sources. This view is somewhat remarkable when it is recalled 
that of the total lime salts in solution in sea water, 90 per cent occur 
in the form of sulphates and would be deposited as gypsum during the 
ordinary processes of evaporation. 

His views on the origin of the drift were in accordance with those 
of the leading authorities of his day. The large bowlders he regarded 
as having been deposited by floating ice and drifted by currents from 
the north while the country was depressed. The opinion which he 
had previously expressed (in 1848) concerning the age of the Lake 
Superior sandstones was in this final report retracted, and he relegated 
them, on stratigraphic evidences only, to the Potsdam formations, 
which is in accordance with the prevailing opinion of to-day.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



Of greater importance was the fact, first announced in his report for 
1847-48, but here brought out in detail, that underlying his lower 
magnesian limestone (Chazy) there were at least six different trilobite- 
bearing beds, separated by from 10 to 150 feet of intervening strata. 
Previous to this no remains of this nature had been reported from any 
American strata older than the Canadian period of the Lower Silurian. 
These trilobite-bearing strata, it should be noted, were found resting 
immediately upon the primal rocks and hence formed the true base of 
the zoological series in the Mississippi Valley. 

On the title page of this volume appeared the cut of the horizontally 
jointed trap of Lake Superior that has long done duty in the text- 
books of Le Conte and others (see tig. 47).

In accordance with an act of Congress approved March 1, 1N47. Dr. 
C. T. Jackson was appointed by the Hon. R. J. Walker, then Secre- 
tary of the Treasury, to make a geological survey of that portion of 
Michigan lying 1 south of Lake Superior and north and

tions of like nature by Owen, the object of this survey 

was to ascertain which of the lands should be classed as mining lands 
and which agricultural. Jackson spent two seasons in the prosecution 
of this work and then resigned, for reasons which seem to have been 
in part personal and in part political, the completion of the work being 
confided to his assistants, J. W. Foster and J. D. Whitne}\ 

Jackson's report was published as House Document No. 5, Thirty- 
first Congress, first session, 1849. It comprised upward of 560 pages, 
with 19 plates, geological maps of Keweenaw Point and Isle Royal, 
and three sections of mines. The eruptive rocks of Keweenaw Point 
were described as having been intruded through linear caverns or 
fractures in the superincumbent rock which they had frequently over- 
flowed, so as to rest unconformahly on their strata. Here is again

recognized the possibility of fissure eruptions us distinctive from the 
crater eruptions of modern volcanoes. 

The red sandstones of Lake Superior were erroneously regarded as 
belonging to the New Red series, the opinion being based upon a tract 
of limestone carrying the fossil Pentamerus oblongus, which was found 
in the midst of the sandstone near Anse. 

Jackson, it is well to note, was opposed to the principle of the reser- 
vation of mineral lands by the General Government. He wrote: 

It may be useful to the public to cause geological and mineralogical surveys to be 
made for their information, but 1 am satisfied that the reservation of mineral lands 
is a great evil to the country, and that the Government never can derive revenue 
from such sources, while the restriction most seriously embarrasses the settlement of 
newly acquired territory. The above remarks are applicable to the whole copper 
region, and 1 would not advise the reservation of any part of it as mineral land. 

Jackson's chief assist- 
ants were J. D. Whitney 
and J. W. Foster, already 
noted, Dr. John Locke, 
and Dr. Wolcott Gibbs. 

In 1848, while occupy- 
ing the chair of zoology 
and geology at Harvard 
University, Louis Agas- 
siz, in company with 
Jules Marcdu and a party 
of students, undertook an 
exploration of the Lake 
Superior region, the re- 
sults of which were pub- 
lished in L850, under the

its Physical Character, 
Vegetation and Animals, 
compared with those of 
other and similar regions. Marcou would have us believe that this 
volume marked an epoch in natural history publications in America, 
this mainly on account of the superior style of its illustrations. Cer- 
tainly there was much to justify the claim. 

The country was nearly everywhere roadless, and transportation by 
water possible only through the aid of birch-bark canoes. As might 
be expected, the purely geological observations were of little value, 
excepting so far as they related to glaciation. Agassiz argued that 
the form of the lake was due to "a series of injections of trap dikes 



416 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

of different characters, traversing the older rocks in various direc- 
tions.' 1 He found six systems of these dikes, to the trend of which the 
various lake shores in a general way conformed. The relationship of 
the various copper deposits he attempted to explain on the somewhat 
remarkable, as well as ingenious, assumption that the material had 
been poured out in a melted condition, and, cooling quickly, remained 
in the native state, offering to the agencies of change a relatively small 
surface exposed in proportion to its mass. At a distance from the 
main mass, where the ejections were small with relatively large sur- 
faces exposed, they became more or less completely changed into 
oxides, sulphides, carbonates, etc. The reader need scarcely be 
reminded that authorities to-day hold quite a different view, and 
regard the copper as having been precipitated by reduction to a native 
state from salts held in permeating solutions. 

Naturally, Agassiz's views, as here set forth on the glacial phe- 
nomena of the region, are of paramount interest. He argued that the 
drift of all northeast America and northwest Europe was contempora- 
neous and due to a general ice sheet. Through a repetition of many 
of his former arguments he showed that a current of water sufficiently 
powerful to transport the large blocks found would have swept prac- 
tically over the entire globe, and not have stopped abruptly, as did the 
drift, after reaching latitude 39° north. This limit of distribution of 
the bowlders to the northern latitudes also indicated to his mind that 
the matter of climate was an important factor. Water-transported 
material, he further argued, would not cause straight furrows and 
scratches, and the theory that such might be due to drifting icebergs 
was rejected on the ground that existing bergs were insufficient, and 
to produce such as were would necessitate a period of cold sufficient 
for his hypothetical polar ice cap.' He pointed out that the northern 
erratics were rounded and widespread; that the highest hills were 
scratched and polished to their summits, while to the southward the 
mountain tops had protruded above the ice sheets and supplied the 
glaciers with their load of angular bowlders. He also called attention 
to the absence of marine or fresh water shells from the glacial (ground 
moraine) deposits, showing it was not subaqueous. Referring to the 
stratified deposits overlying the drift, he wrote: 

The various heights at which these stratified deposits occur above the level of the 
sea. show plainly that since their accumulation the mainland has been lifted above 
the ocean at different rates in different parts of the country. 

And, further: 

It must be at once obvious that the various kinds of loose materials all over the 
northern hemisphere have been accumulated, not only under different circumstances, 
but "luring long-continued subsequent distinct periods. To the first — or ice period — 
belong all phenomena connected with the transportation of erratic bowlders, polish- 
ing, scratching, etc., and during which the land stood at a higher level. To the 
second belong the stratified drift, such as indicate a depression of the continent.

Fig. 49.— Louis Agassiz. 



Louis Agassiz was born in Motier, Switzerland, in 1807, and came 
into world-wide notoriety through his works on fossil fishes and his 
enthusiastic exploitation of the glacial discoveries of Hugi, Venetz, 
and Gharpentier, while in Neuchatel. He came to 
sketch of Agassiz. America to better his finances in 1846, and after deliv- 
ering courses of lectures before the Lowell Institute 
in Boston and in other of the eastern cities, 
accepted, in 1847, the professorship of geol- 
ogy and zoology in Harvard University. 
Agassiz was not, however, a geologist, and 
his service to this branch of science after 
coming to America was more as a teacher 
and through arousing public interest than 
by research. His enthusiasm was too great. 
his staying power too slight; he was too 
prone to jurapat conclusions to make a good 
geologist, as shown in his hasty assumption 
that the bowlders of decomposition found by 
him in Brazil were drift bowlders and indica- 
tive of a former glacial period in that latitude. 

The work begun by Jackson in Michigan 
and under direction of the General Land Office in 1847 was. as already 
shown, continued by Messrs. J. W. Foster and J. D." Whitney. Their 
reports were issued in octavo form. Vol. I, on the copper lands, con-

an immense depression which has been for 
the most part excavated out of the soft sandstone of the Potsdam age. 
The configuration of that portion of the lake lying west of longitude 
88 was deemed as due to two axes of elevation extending in parallel 
lines from the northeast to the southwest, which upraised the sand- 
stone, causing it to form a synclinal valley.

418 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

This, it will be noted, is radically different from the idea put forward 
by Agassiz. 

The conglomerate composed of rounded fragments of jaspery rock, 
so abundant throughout the copper region of the south shore of the 
lake, they regarded" as a friction conglomerate, testifying to the 
"■intensity of the force with which the eruptive rocks have been pro- 
pelled from the interior through the earth's crust,"" the detritus hav- 
ing been redistributed by the waters, following in this the teachings 
of Von Buch. Their graphic account of the conditions under which 
it was supposed to have been formed is worthy of being reproduced 
entire: 

We may suppose that at one time all of this district (i. e.,the copper district) 
tunned a part of the bed of the primeval ocean. Adopting the theory of a cooling 
globe, we may further suppose that the waters were in a heated condition and dif- 
fered essentially in chemical composition from those of the present oceans. The 
earth's crust was intersected by numerous powerful fissures, and the communication 
between the exterior and interior was unobstructed. Volcanic phenomena were 
much more frequent and exerted on a grander scale. Each volcanic paroxysm would 
give rise to powerful currents and agitations of the water, and their abrading action 
in detaching portions of the preexisting rocks, and depositing them in beds and lay- 
ers on the floor of the ocean, would operate with greater intensity than at the pres- 
ent time. We can trace the remains of one volcanic fissure extending from the head 
of Keweenaw Point, in a southwesterly direction, to the western limits of the dis- 
trict, and of another, in a parallel direction, from the head of Neepigon Bay to the 
western limits of Isle Royale. Along the lines of these fissures existed numerous 
volcanic vents, like those observed at this day in Peru, Guatemala, and Java, which 
were characterized by periods of activity and repose. From these vents were poured 
forth numerous sheets of trap, which flowed over the sands and clays then in the 
progress of accumulation. During the throes and convulsions of the mass portions 
of rock would become detached and rounded simply by the effects of attrition, and. 
jets of melted matter be projected as volcanic bombs through the air or water, which, 
on cooling, would assume spheroidal forms; while other portions of the rock, in a 
state of minute mechanical division, would be ejected in the form of ashes and sand, 
which, mingling with the water, would be deposited as the oscillations subsided 
among the sands and pebbles at the bottom of the sea. During the whole of this 
period of volcanic activity the sands which now form the base of the Silurian system 
were in the progress of accumulation and became mingled with these igneous 
products. The level of the sea, as evidenced by the ripple marks, was subject to 
repeated alterations; sometimes it rose so shoal that the marks of the rippling waves 
were impressed on the sands, at others it sank to unfathomable depths. 

In the process of consolidation the rocks became traversed by numerous fissures, 
and the water, charged with lime, was forced in like jets of steam, filling them with 
materials different from the inclosing mass. In this way the pores in the conglom- 
erate and the vesicles of the amygdaloid were filled. 

. The formation of the copper and silver ores they regarded as duo 
probably to electro-chemical agencies. To quote their own words: 

The existence of two metals side by side, like copper and silver, each chemically 
pure and capable of being alloyed in any proportions; the accumulation of the latter 
near the cross courses or at the junction of two mineral planes; the changes in the 
metallic contents of lodes in their passage through different rocks, and the parallel 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1840—1849. 4 1 ( d 

arrangement of the earthy gangues, all seem to indicate the existence of electrical 
currents during the period of their formation. 

Concerning the origin of the drift and the phenomena of the groov- 
ing^ and striationsof the rocks in the regions, they were still somewhat 
in the dark. The position of bowlders resting on stratified deposits of 
sand and clay was regarded as antagonistic to the theory of a general 
ice cap similar to that of the circumpolar region. It was thought 
that such might rather have been transported by floating ice (not ice- 
bergs) in the same manner that bowlders are even now each spring 
transported from the borders of the northern lakes and rivers and 
dispersed over the adjacent swamps and lowlands. 

The slates of the region were looked upon as probably originally 
laid down as volcanic ashes and subsequently consolidated — a by no 
means improbable theory. The specular and magnetic iron ores they, 
strangely enough, regarded as 

a purely igneous product, in some instances poured out, but in others sublimated, 

from the interior of the earth. We may conceive that the various rocks of the Azoic 
series were originally deposited in a nearly horizontal position. During the deposi- 
tion of these strata, at various intervals sheets of plastic matter were poured forth 
from below and spread out upon the surface of the pre-existing strata. During this 
period the interior of the earth was the source of constant emanations of iron, which 
appeared at the surface in the form of a plastic mass in combination with oxygen, 
or rose in metallic vapors or as a sublimate, perhaps as a chloride: in the one case it 
covered over the surface like a lava sheet, in the other it was absorbed into the 
adjacent rocks or diffused through the strata in the process of formation. 

The igneous rocks they classified as dolerite, anamesite, and basalt. 
The sandstone, which occupies almost exclusively the bed of Lake 
Superior and which occurs in isolated patches along the shore and on 
the islands, they rightly classed as Potsdam, differing in this respect 
with Jackson, who considered it as New Red, and from Locke and 
others, who thought it to be the equivalent of the Old Red or Devonian 
sandstone of Europe. 

The work on the Paleozoic rocks, as given in Part II of these 

reports, was done by James Hall, of New York. The limestones 

iirst seen upon St. Marys River, Hall regarded as identical with the

designated as the Galena limestone, which he errone- 
ously regarded as a distinct member of the Lower Silurian system. 
not recognized in the East. 

In his chapter on the parallelism of the Paleozoic deposits of the 
United States and Europe, Hall called attention to the fact that — 

The simplest principles of elementary geology teach us that sedimentary beds, 
having the same thickness and same lit hographical characters, can not have spread 
over an area so wide as that now included between the European and American 
continents. All sedimentary deposits must vary in character at remote points, as 



•120 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904: 

the physical conditions of the ocean can not be presumed to have remained the same 
over a wide extent of surface. Under such circumstances, absolute parallelism is not 
to he sought for or expected. Calcareous deposits, as would naturally be supposed, 
have beenfoundto be more persistent and more uniform in the character of their fossil 
contents; hut these, over some portion of their extent, have often been invaded by 
argillaceous and arenaceous sediments, and the fauna is found to be in a greater or 
less degree influenced by such circumstances.

authorities as passing from Devonian to Carboniferous, he wrote: 

It is so enormously great that we find no parallel to it in any preceding period. 
* * * From all these farts there seems to he but one conclusion, and that is, in 
the British Isles particularly, either there are remarkable exceptions to the general 
law in the continuation of species from one to another or that there is no foundation 
for a distinction between the Devonian and.Carboniferous systems. 

Further on he wrote: 

We can not avoid the conclusion that, if we adopt the Devonian system with the 
limits suggested by foreign writers, we must drop forever the attempt to recognize 
the Ludlow division of the Silurian system. 



422 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

The drift phenomena of the region studied by Foster and Whit 
Desor on the ney were described by E. Desor, who divided the 

deposits into four classes, as follows, beginning 
with the lowermost: 

* 1. A layer of coarse, pebbly loam called "coarse drift." 

2. Clay resting either on the coarse drift or directly on the rock. 

3. A deposit of sand, gravel, and pebbles, irregularly stratified, resting upon the 
clay or the bed rock. 

4.. Isolated bowlders scattered over the whole region. 

While disclaiming any intention of giving a general theory for the 
causes and origin of the drift, he argued that the phenomena he 
described indicated neither paroxysmal agencies nor the operation of 
any single cause, however long continued. "They disclose a long 
series of events which have resulted from causes highly diversified, 
and as yet imperfectly known. Three periods are recognized in the 
history of the drift of the Lake Superior region: (1) 'The period of 
the grooving and polishing of the rocks, 1 which ' must be considered 
as the dawning of the drift epoch;' (2) a period of comparative qui- 
escence, extending over a long period of time and during which the 
stratum of red clay was deposited. This is the second era of the drift. 
(3) The overlying stratum of sand and gravel presumably formed by 
water, but at higher levels than the clay and indicating a still further 
depression of the land. This period characterized by intervals of agi- 
tation and repose. He considered that earthquake waves, according 
to H. I). Rogers's ingenious theory, might be responsible in part for 
these. " 

The transportation of the bowlders, he thought, took place at the 
close of the drift epoch. 

In another article in the American Journal of Science for the same 
year (1852), concerning the post-Pliocene of the Southern States and 
its relation to the Laurentian of the North and the deposits of the 
Mississippi Valley, Desor attempted to account for the large bowlders 
in the drift of Long Island by means of ice rafts. The bowlders in 
the post-Pliocene of the Southern States were doubtfully referred to 
water action only. 

Desor, according to Marcou, was a German, who had come to Amer- 
ica as private secretary to Agassiz, and whatever views he may have 
had on glaciation or other scientific subjects maybe regarded as mainly 
absorbed rather than learned from observation. Through becoming 
over-presumptuous he had a falling out with his master, which resulted 
in his discharge in 1848 and return to Germany in 1852, passing thus 
beyond the limits of our field of study. 

J. D. Dana, as already noted, served as geologist in the United 
States exploring expedition under Captain Wilkes, during the years 
L838-42. The results of his observations during this time are embod-

of 75b' pages, with a folio atlas of 21 plates. Many of 

Dana and the Wilkes , , . . . ., . , n , , 

Exploring the conclusions given in this volume were nrst pub- 

lished in the columns of the American Journal of 
Science, and have already received attention. 

One of the earliest results of Dana's work, as here chronicled, was 
the establishment of the principle that temperature influences the 
growth and distribution of corals. A claim to priority in this discov- 
ery was made by James P. Couthouy, and brought about a personal 
controversy somewhat bitter between the two authors. This has been 
alluded to elsewhere (p. 373). 

The existence of harbors about the coral-bound reefs Dana attrib- 
uted largely to the action of tidal and local marine currents, though 
the presence of fresh-water streams may have contributed toward the 
same end. 

He rejected the then popular theory of the formation of coral reefs 
and atolls through the gradual subsidence of volcanoes, the crater cor- 
responding to the lagoon and the rim to the belt of land, though 
believing that, beyond question, a subsidence had taken place through- 
out a large part of the Pacific, and hence that subsidence must form 
a part of any true theory of the origin of the reefs. 

He believed that the atoll once formed a fringing reef about a high 
island. This, as the island subsided, became a barrier reef, which 
continued its growth while the land slowly disappeared. The area of 
waters within finally contained the last sinking peak, which itself 
finally disappeared, leaving only the barrier at the surface and an 
islet or two of coral in the inclosed lagoon. 

These were essentially the views put forward independently by Dar- 
win. The recent work of the younger Agassiz has shown them to be 
not wholly correct. 

From the actual extent of the present coral reefs and islands Dana 
inferred that the whole amount of high land lost to the Pacific by this 
subsidence was at least 50,000 square miles, probably much greater, 
though he would not go so far as to conclude that a continent once 
occupied the place of the present ocean, or indeed of a portion of it. 

In the discussion of the Hawaiian volcanoes it was noted that no 
apparent connection existed, so far as indicated by the phenomena of 
eruption, between Mount Loa and Kilauea, 16 miles distant and more 
than 10,000 feet lower. It was therefore concluded that the two 
conduits, which he assumed were once connected by a fissure, had 
become isolated through the solidifying of the lava between them, each 
conduit being possibly a separate branch of some deep-seated channel. 

The wide difference in the height of the columns of lava in two vol- 
canoes so near together as those noted above caused him also to doubt 
the statement so commonly made by writers of that day to the effect 
that volcanoes were safety valves. 



424 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Assuredly, if, while Kilauea is open on the Hanks of Mount Loa — a vast gulf :'.', 
miles in diameter — lavas still rise and are poured out, Kilauea is do safety valve 
even to the area covered by this single mountain alone. 

The conclusions based upon the .study of these Hawaiian volcanoes 
were to the effect that: 

1. The majority of the Pacific volcanic summits were formed from 
successive eruptions of molten rock, alternating sometimes with cinder 
or fragmentary ejections. 

2. That the eruptions are, in general, the result of a rising or ascent 
of the lavas, owing to the inflation by heat of such vaporizable sub- 
stances as sulphur and water, the overflow or lateral outbreak taking 
place in consequence of the increased pressure from gravity and from 
the elasticity of the confined vapors, the contraction of the earth's sur- 
face being no more necessary for an eruption than the contraction of 
the sides of a pot of water to make it boil. 

lie concluded further that volcanic action usually proceeded from 
fresh water gaining access to a branch belonging to some particular 
outlet or vent, and not to a common channel at greater depth. The 
lack of sympathetic action between two neighboring vents was thus 
explained on the ground that the union of their channels ""took place 
far below the level to which the waters that ordinarily feed the tires 
gain access." 

To the elevation theories of volcanic craters advocated by Von Buch 
he took exception, as he did also to the theory of Bischoff, who 
appealed to the internal igneous fluids for the source of volcanic action. 

The highly feldspathic, coarsely crystalline, and solid centers of 
certain volcanic mountains, in contrast with the more vesicular and loss 
dense outer portions, he rightly ascribed to slowness in cooling, the 
central mass being protected on all sides from the external air. Inci- 
dental^ he discussed a problem which has become known to modern 
petrographers as that of magmatic differentiation. He argued that, 
given a large crater like that of Kilauea, the rise of the lavas through 
the center would be accompanied hy a descending current along the 
side, though of less distinctness. The essential constituents of a rock, 
for example, being augite and feldspar, wherever the temperature of 
the liquid mass becomes sufficiently lowered, there the feldspar will 
commence to solidify or will slowly stiffen in the midst of the fluid 
material made up of the other ingredients. Under these conditions 
the ascending vapors would urge the feldspar upward much less freely 
than the more liquid part of the lava, for the latter would } T ield more 
readily to the inflating vapors and thus become lighter and rise to the 
surface. This process, going on throughout the whole progress of 
the cone, would keep the center feldspathic below a short distance 
from the summit. The residue from the feldspathic crystallization, 
consisting of ferruginous silicates, would be brought upward in the 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1840 L849. 425 

form of a frothy scoria which must on either side, in part, return to 
supply the place of the ascending current. On cooling, then, the 
more basaltic portions would constitute this exterior descending part. 
Thus, a feldspathic center and basaltic flanks would be the result of 
one and the same process. This feldspathic center, further, by being 
inclosed within a thick covering of rocks, would cool slowly, forming, 
perhaps, disseminated crystals in the earthy base, or, if cooling suffi- 
ciently slowly, a crystalline granular mass like granite or syenite. 
He recognized the fact — 

that particular rocks have no necessary relation to time, excepting so far as time is 
connected with a difference in the earth's temperature or climate and also in oceanic 
or atmospheric pressure, for, if the elements are at hand, it requires only different 
circumstances as regards pressure, heat, and slowness of cooling to form any igneous 
rock the world contains. 

The date of the beginning of volcanic activity on the Hawaiian 
Islands he placed as far back as the early Carboniferous or Silurian 
epoch, and believed that: (1) There were as many separate rents in the 
region as there are now islands; ('2) that each rent was widest in the 
southeast portion; (3) that the southernmost rent was the largest, and 
(4) that the order of extinction of the volcanoes was as follows: 

1. Kauai. 

2. Western Oahu. 

3. Western Maui (Mount Eeka). 

4. Eastern Oahu. 

5. Northwestern Hawaii (Mount Kea). 

6. Southeast Maui (Mount Kale-a-kala). 
T. Southeast Hawaii (Mount Loa). 

From the general arrangement of the islands in the Pacific and the 
study of the phenomena connected therewith the conclusion was reached 
that the Hawaiian group originated in a series of rents or ruptures 
seldom continued at the surface for a long distance, but frequently 
advancing successively, one after the other, causing the resultant 
islands to appear in the form of a curve rather than a straight line, 
and. further, it was announced that: (1) While straight ranges are of 
occasional occurrence, curved ranges are still more common; (2) that 
curvature may arise either from a gradual change of trend in the sub- 
ordinate parts or from the position of these parts in a series; (3) that 
the same great chain may change its direction 60 c or more, and con- 
sequently (4) the course of a mountain chain can be no evidence of its 
age. In this it will be observed he differed radically from Elie de 
Beaumont. 

Dana noted further that the Pacific islands were arranged mainly in 
two systems of linear groups nearly at right angles with each other, 
the linear groups being based on a series of ruptures instead of a 
single uninterrupted fissure. The prevailing uniformity of trend of 



42C> REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

these fissures or ruptures he believed to be due both to the nature of 
the crust fractured and the direction of the fracturing forces. He 
accepted the doctrine of an earth cooled from a state of fusion, and 
regarded the influence of electric currents on the position of conti- 
nents in process of formation as an established fact. An outer crust 
having once formed, the deep-seated crystallization would go on at a 
rate inconceivably slower, and circumstances would be favorable for 
a coarse crystallization of the material below and for the operation of 
electrical currents. The rupturing force he believed to be contraction 
caused by cooling. He argued that a cooling globe incrusted over by 
refrigeration while contraction was still going on beneath would, like 
a Prince Rupert's drop, be in a state of tension. Such a tension is 
bound to produce fractures and displacements, the direction of which 
would depend on rate of cooling in different parts and on the change 
in the earth's oblateness accompanying a diminution of its diameter. 
He concluded, from the absence of volcanoes in the interior of conti- 
nents, that these portions of the globe cooled first and became solid; 
the intermediate portions cooling later and at a less rapid rate con- 
tracted most, since the crust was here thinnest. The oceanic areas 
would therefore be gradually subsiding and the tension increasing: 
moreover the tension, from its nature, would be exerted nearly hori- 
zontally. He inferred, therefore, that the subsiding oceans have pro- 
duced the mountains of the continents, and that the oceanic and 
continental areas have never changed places, and saw no reason for 
appealing to an incomprehensible subterranean force for the uplift- 
ing of the mountain chains or the continents. Such may have been 
"only a result on the whole of the deepening of the ocean's bed. 
It is obvious * * * that the earth has reached its present con- 
dition by gradual progress from a state of prolonged igneous action 
through epochs of increasing quiet, interrupted by distant periods 
of violence, to the present time, when even the gentlest oscillations 
of the crust have almost ceased." These same ideas he had previously 
put forward in a paper in the American Journal of Science on the 
Origin of some of the Physical Features of the Earth's Crust, noted 
elsewhere. 

In his discussion of the origin of the coal beds of New South Wales, 
Dana concluded — 

that the layers of the coal series were probably deposited by fresh-waters during the 
different stages of annual floods and wider deluges occurring at more distant periods} 
that the subsidence, which may have been gradual during the coal deposits, finally 
submerged the whole. 

Another important observation bearing on the same subject was 
made when writing on the geology of Luzon and its coal beds: 

One of the interesting points about this lake (Laguna de Bay) is the fact that vast 
quantities of plants live on its surface and pass down the river into the bay, carry- 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1840-1849. 427 

hig along great numbers of fresh-water snails of different species. Here we have 
therefore, fresh-water shells and vegetation which is not marine accumulating under 
salt water, for they sink after a while and must become buried in the mud of the 
bottom, along with the remains of marine life. This floating vegetation illustrates a 
theory with regard to the vegetation of the coal beds. 

The gold excitement of California in 1848-49 drew attention to a 

region the geology of which was practically unknown. Fremont's 

expedition to California and Oregon in 1843-44 was not accompanied 

by a geologist, and the few fossils collected were

forma Crold Kegion, six pages only, were given by 
C. S. Lyman in the American Journal of Science for 1849, while 
J. D. Dana had touched upon the subject during his return overland 
after the disaster to the Wilkes Exploring Expedition. The main 
gold-bearing area was, therefore, practically an unknown land. The 
appearance in 1850 of Philip T. Tyson's Geology and Industrial 
Resources of California was consequently important. Tyson seems 
to have gone to California in 1849 as a private citizen, but so great 
was the demand for information concerning the region that on his 
return he made a report to Col. J. J. Abert, which was printed as a 
Senate document the year following. 

In this report Tyson gave eight sections across the gold country, 
two of which extended from the coast to the Sierras.. These were pub- 
lished as mere outlines, showing the direction of the dip of the rocks, 
but with no pretense to scale. He described the western flank of the 
Sierras as consisting of a vast mass of metamorphic and hypogene 
rocks, stretching from the Sacramento Valley to the axis of the moun- 
tains. The metamorphic rocks, mainly slates, contained the veins of 
auriferous quartz, through the breaking down of which had been 
derived the gold found in the gravels of the ravines. 

Making all due allowance for Tyson's laudable desire to check the 
wide and rapidly spreading excitement, bordering almost upon insan- 
ity, caused by grossly exaggerated accounts of the richness of the 
mines, still it would seem as if through overzealousness, or perhaps 
through actual ignorance, he underestimated their value, both to his 
own and others detriment. But it must be remembered that at that 
time and in that remote region, deposits, either placer or in veins, 
that could to-day be profitably worked, were valueless. He warned 
prospective investors that the large bodies of gold-bearing quartz found 
on the surface would if followed be found to be "'nothing more than 
descending veins securely held between solid rocks, and that the cost 
of mining such was enormous, whilst the chances were almost wholly 
against their containing gold in proportion that would pay expenses. " 
Indeed, Tyson regarded the prospect of a profitable mining of the 
veins as ''altogether too remote and uncertain to be relied on."

Tyson's Work in 
Maryland. 



During the session of 1847-48 the legislature of Maryland passed an 

act providing for the appointment and commission of a "person of 

ability, integrity, and suitable practical and scientific attainments," 

who should act as agricultural chemist for the State. 

Higgins's Work in . . 

Maryland, Ihese requirements seem to have been met in the per- 

I 848=1 8 58 

son of Dr. James Higgins, who received the appoint- 
ment and held the office until 1858, during which time he issued live 
reports. The office was not really a geological one, and the matter is 
mentioned here as bearing upon the subject only indirectly. During 
the session of 1858 bills were brought before the legislature to have 
the title of the office changed to geologist and, again, to chemist and 

geologist. Both, however, 
failed. Higgins was suc- 
ceeded in 1859 by the Philip 
Tyson above noted, whose first report of 145 
octavo pages and appendix of 20 pages was 
issued February 14, I860. Like the reports 
of his predecessor, this was given up very 
largely to a discussion of agricultural ques- 
tions, but contained chapters on the Min- 
erals Comprising the Rocks of the State; 
The Mineral Character of Rocks; The Con- 
sideration of the Rocks as Grouped into 
Geological Formations, and also their Geo- 
graphic Distribution in Maryland; and on 
Chemical and Physical Geology, in which 
the question of the origin of soils through rock weathering was 
discussed. 

The main interest in the work, from our present standpoint, lies in 
the colored geological map (and sections) which accompanied it, and 
which had the merit of being the first special map of the State, the 
area having, of course, been included in the general maps of Maclure 
and others. The various formations were classified according to the 
scheme of Rogers for the map of Pennsylvania, and a table given 
showing which of these were found within the State limits. The second 
report, which appeared in 1862, comprised 92 pages, and was given 
over almost wholly to a discussion of economic questions, including 
the soils and ores, coal, marbles, clays, etc. From the presence of 
fossil cycads, found associated with the iron ores, Tyson was disposed 
to consider these and the clays in which they occur as belonging to the 
oolitic period."

CHAPTER V. 

THE ERA OF STATE SURVEYS, THIRD DECADE, 1850-1859. 

The period of financial depression, which proved so fatal to the 
State surveys during- the last decade, had run its course. Several 
new States had in the meantime been added to the Union, some of 
which showed commendable promptness in authorizing geological sur- 
veys. New organizations were thus formed in fourteen States, eight 
of which had made no previous attempt. These eight, in alphabetical 
order, are California. Illinois, Iowa. Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri. 
Texas, and Wisconsin. Six States for the second time undertook 
the work — Michigan, New Jersey. North and South Carolina, Ten- 
nessee, and Vermont. The National Government was also active, the 
most important undertaking being the surveys in connection with the 
proposed Pacific railways. In addition to these, C apt. K. H. Marcy 
made a survey of the Red River region of Louis-iana, Maj. W. H. 
Emory one of the Mexican boundary, and Colonel Pope one into the 
arid region of New Mexico along the thirty-second parallel. To each 
and all of these expeditions geologists, or at least naturalists, were 
attached. In the British provinces Logan's survey was doing good 
service, while Daw T son, alone and unofficially, was working in Nova 
Scotia. 

This was an era of publication, not merely of reports, but of books. 
Emmons's American Geology, Dawson's Acadian Geology, Hitchcock's 
Geology of the Globe, Lesley's Manual of Coal and his Iron Manu- 
facturer's Guide, Owen's Key to the Geology of the Globe, and Whit- 
ney's Metallic Wealth of the United States were among the more 
important local productions. The publication of by far the greatest 
importance of this decade was, however, the long-delayed report of 
the Pennsylvania survey, to which allusion has been made elsewhere 
two ponderous quartos which were truly epoch-making, although 
many of the more striking features had found their way into print 
elsewhere. The issuance of Murchison's Siluria, the ninth edition of 
Ly ell's Principles, and F. Roemer's Die Kreidebildungen von Texas 
were also matters worthy of note. Hitchcock's Surface Features 
belongs to this era. and marked the beginning of systematic study 
along lines of physiography. Among the new names will be found 
those of W. P. Blake, J. W. Dawson, Leo Lesquereux. Oscar Lieber,

An agricultural and geological survey of Mississippi way inaugu- 
rated in connection with the State University through an act of the 
legislature approved March 5, 1850. Under this act Dr. John Mil- 
MHiington and ling-ton was appointed professor of geology and agri- 

MAsfs S si S p^ o i850- culture, in connection with the professorship of 
1852 \ chemistry, which he already held. Professor Milling- 

ton, however, relinquished the situation the latter part of 1850 with- 
out having made a report, and in 1852 was succeeded by Prof. B. L. C. 
Wailes. Professor Wailes made but one report, this an octavo vol- 
ume of 356 pages and an appendix. Of this, but pages 207 to 288 
deal with matters strictly geological. The work is by no means of a 
high order and made no permanent impression upon the science of 
geology either in the State or country at large. His colored sections 
are crude and the language pedantic. In fact, there is scarcely a sin- 
gle original observation which can be unhesitatingly accepted, owing 
to the general air of unfamiliarity with the subject that everywhere 
prevails. 

He made no attempt to classify the rocks he described otherwise 
than Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Quaternary, and inferentially classed 
among the latter the sandstones of the Grand Gulf group, which he 
mentioned as overlying the Diluvial gravel. He traced correctly, 
according to Hilgard, the northern limits of Grand Gulf formation 
from the Mississippi across the Pearl River to Brandon, and described 
its occurrence in southwestern Mississippi. 

In 1851 Ebenezer Emmons, heretofore connected with the survey of 
New York, was appointed State geologist of North Carolina, a posi- 
tion he continued to hold until the time of his death in 1863, though the 
work of the survey came to a close in 1860, owing to 

E. Emmons's Work . . . .. „ • i i 

in North Carolina, the outbreak of the civil war. Emmons was assisted by 

1 851 

his son, Ebenezer Emmons, jr., and during his period 
of office issued live reports, the first, bearing the date of 1852, forming 
an octavo pamphlet of 181 pages. It related principally to the geology 
of the eastern counties and the coal. Emmons recognized the fact 
that the coal-bearing rocks of North Carolina were not of the same age 
as those of Pennsylvania, and regarded them as presumably of the 
same age as those of the Richmond coal fields, which at that time were 
thought by Prof. W. B. Rogers to be Liassic, though Emmons ques- 
tioned if they might not be Permian or Triassic 

The tinding of saurian remains in the sandstones he regarded as 
pointing to their possible Permian age, though 

The meager list of plants and animals * * * furnish only grounds for conjec- 
ture to what age the formations belong. My opinion, derived from all the farts and 
circumstances known to me, inclines me to adopt the belief that it is the upper New

Red sandstone. Still, if the Richmond coal basin is of the same age as the coal rocks 
of North Carolina, geologists will be disposed to place the series along with the 
Oolites or Lias, as Profs. W. B. Rogers and Sir Chas. Lyell have done." 

Emmons in this work rejected completely the old Wernerian classi- 
fication of (1) Primitive, (2) Transition, and (3) Tertiary, and intro- 
duced that given in tabular form below. It seems to have met with 
little favor, and was not, so far as the present writer is aware, adopted 
in a single instance elsewhere. 

EMMONS'S ROCK CLASSIFICATION, PROPOSED IX 1852. 

1. Pyrocrystalline — crystallized by the agency of tire. Primary of authors. 
II. Pyroplastic — molded by tire. Ancient and modern volcanic rock of authors. 

III. Hydroplastic — molded by water. Sediments of authors. 

The first class is divided into two sections: 

1. I nstratitied pyrocrystalline, as granite, hypersthene rock, pyrocrystalline lime- 
stone, sienite, magnetic iron ores. 

2. Stratified pyrocrystalline gneiss, mica slate, talcose slate, and hornblende 
steatite. 

The second class is divided into two sections, also: 

1. Modern pyroplastic rocks, lavas, tuffs, pumice, and all the products of volcanoes, 
which are cooled in the air. 

2. Ancient pyroplastic rocks, the ancient lavas, cooled under water, basalt, por- 
phyry, and green stone. 

The third class is divided into systems, most of which are admitted 
by geologists of this day. 

The systems belonging to the class of hydroplastic rocks, the con- 
solidated and loose sediments, are exhibited in the following table: 

I. Tertiary system: 

1. Postpliocene. 

2. Pliocene. 
3 Miocene. 
4. P]ocene. 

II. Cretaceous system: 

1. Upper Cretaceous, including the. true chalk, with flints. 

2. Lower Cretaceous, including the green sand, iron sands, etc. 
III. Wealdon, unknown in the United States. 

IV. Oolite and Lias. 

V. New Red Sandstone or Trias: 

1. Upper. 

2. Middle. 
'.->. Lower. 



"At a meeting of the Boston Society of Natural History on January 4, 1854, Prof. 
W. B. Rogers summed up the evidence regarding the red sandstone of Virginia and 
North Carolina, and found it "to confirm the conclusion of their Jurassic date." 
The fossils thus far formed in the more western red sandstone belt ami its extrusion 
through Pennsylvania and New Jersey showed this also to be Jurassic, a little Lower 
probably than that of Virginia and North Carolina. He felt that there was little 
doubt but that the same conclusions would apply also to the sandstone of the Con- 
necticut Valley.

Emmons's second report, comprising- 351 pages, was issued in 185t>. 
It related chiefly to the geology and mines of the so-called midland 
counties. In 1858 his Report on the Agriculture of the Eastern Coun- 
ties was issued. About one-third of this, notwithstanding its title, 
was given up to paleontological matters. In 1860 two more reports, 
both short, appeared — the one devoted mainly to agriculture and the 
other a special report on the swamp lands. 

In the report for 1858 Emmons announced a principle which has 
since been enunciated in somewhat different words by our mos.t emi- 
nent authority on soils. This, in his own words, is as follows: 

In the examination of soils the physical properties require as much attention as 
the chemical, for in order that a good chemical mixture of elements may be fertile 
they should possess a certain degree of adhesiveness or closeness which will retain 
water. 

A good deal of attention was given to the marls of the State with 
reference to their availability for fertilizing purposes, though he 
recognized the fact that, unfortunately for the best interests of agri- 
culture, these marls are too sandy to bear transportation to distant 
points. 

A geological survey of Illinois was organized under an act of the 

general assembly approved February IT, 1851. This act authorized 

the governor, auditor, and treasurer to employ a competent geologist, 

who was required to make "a complete geological 

MYi™i°° d i8M°i857. an( l mineralogical survey of the entire territory of the 

State," and provided that — 

The said geologist should proceed to ascertain the order, successive arrangement, 
relative position, dip, and comparative magnitude of the several strata or geological 
formations in the State, and to search for and examine all the beds and deposits of 
ores, coals, clays, marls, rocks, and such other mineral substances as may present 
themselves; to obtain chemical analyses of the same, and to determine by baromet- 
rical observations the relative elevation of the different portions of the State. 

He was also required " to procure and preserve an entire suite of 
the different specimens found in the State, to be preserved and prop- 
erly arranged in a cabinet, and placed in the office of the secretary of 
state in the State Capitol;'* and eventually "to publish with the final 
reports a geological map of the State." 

Under the provisions of this act Dr. J. (i. Norwood was appointed 
State geologist, and the work was begun in October, 1851, by an

examination of the formations exposed in the bluffs of the Ohio River 
between Shawneetown and Cairo. 

The act appropriated the sum of $3,000 a year for carrying on the 
work. In 1853 the amount was increased to $5,000, with $500 addi- 
tional for topographical purposes. Up to January, 1857, some 
$27,000 had been expended, though no report appears to have been 
made. 

The usual trials of a State geologist seem to have come upon the 
path of Mr. Norwood and perhaps some that were unusual. Be that 
as it may, a committee was appointed to investigate the conditions of 
the office. The committee reported, however, that in their belief the 
money had been well expended, a large amount of work had been done, 
and that well done, and they recommended an appropriation of the 
sum of $6,500 to enable Mr. Norwood to 
complete a report on the economic resources 
of the State, on which he was then engaged. 

The report of the committee seems, how- 
ever, to have failed of its purpose, since the 
only outcome was a small octavo pamphlet 
of less than 100 pages devoted wholly to a 
discussion of the coals of the State, accom- 
panied by a considerable number of analyses. 
This report bore the date of 1857, and 
was Norwood's last as well as first/' It was 
accompanied by a small, one-page, colored 
geological map of the State. 

Presumably, all members of the legisla- 
ture were not as favorably disposed toward 
Doctor Norwood as were the members of the investigating committee, 
for the following year (1858) he was supplanted by Mi'. A. H. Worthen, 
who had been connected with James Hall on the State survey of Iowa. 

In 1852 the question of the reestablishment of the geological sur- 
vey of Indiana was agitated, but nothing came of it until the following 
year, when, acting under a recommendation of Governor J. A. Wright, 
second Attempt at a the le g' islatui 'e i"^le a small appropriation to become

the governor appointed Dr. Ryland T. Brown State 
geologist. The venture was, however, short lived. Brown made but 
one report, which the legislature refused to publish, and at the 
same time refused further appropriation for continuing the survey, 

"In 1855 Norwood, in connection with Mr. Henry Patton, published in the Jour- 
nal of the Academy of Natural Sciences a paper comprising some 77 pa.ges <>f text 
relating to the work thus far done.

the main reason given for such action being an overvaluation of the 
Indiana coals on the part of Brown. The report, it should be men- 
tioned, was subsequently published in the report of the board of 
agriculture. 

. In 1852, in compliance with a resolution of the United States Senate, 
Capt. R. B. Marcy was directed to proceed "without unnecessary 

dela} 7 " to make an examination 

of the upper Red River and the 

country immediately bordering 

upon it from 

Cache Creek 
to its sources. The officers of 
the expedition, which left Fort 
Belknap, Texas, on the 2d of 
May, consisted of Captain 
Marc} 7 , in charge; Bvt. Capt. 
George B. McClellan, U. S. En- 
gineer; and Dr. G. G. Shumard, 
the last named, in addition to 
his duties as surgeon, acting as 
naturalist. The report sub- 
mitted formed an octavo vol- 
ume of 820 pages with 65 plates, 
of which 25 may be considered 
as geological, 6 of these being 
of invertebrate fossils. The 
geological part proper com- 
prised but 32 pages, which 
were by President Edward 
Hitchcock, of Amherst -Col- 
lege. The invertebrate fossils 
were described by B. F. Shu- 
mard. 

Dr. G. G. Shumard's report 
consisted of a brief sum mar} 7 of 
the geology of a portion of 
northwestern Arkansas, which he considered as essential to a proper 
understanding of that which was to follow, succeeded by memo- 
randa of the various t3 7 pes of rocks, minerals, and formations passed 
over each day. It was accompanied by a colored geological sec- 
tion from Fort Belknap, Texas, to Washington County, Arkansas, 
showing a granitic axis flanked on either side by Carboniferous lime- 
stone, in its turn overlaid by Coal Measures, and with Cretaceous 
deposits between Fort Wichita and Cross Timbers in Texas. 




AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1850—1859. 



435 



In the paleontological report by Dr. B. F. Shumard there were 
described Carboniferous fossils from Washington and Crawford coun- 
ties, Arkansas, and Cretaceous forms from Fort Wichita and the Cross 
Timbers regions of Texas. 

Hitchcock, in his report, dwelt particularly on the possible Carbon- 
iferous age of various beds of coal, reported by Shumard, and the 
economic value of the gypsum, as well as the ores of copper and gold. 
His reference to the canyons of the Red River is particularly interest- 
ing in view of his early writings regarding the Connecticut (p. 31<»): 

You seem in doubt whether this gorge was worn away by the river or is the result 
of some paroxysmal convulsion. You will allow me to say that I have scarcely any 
doubt that the stream itself has done the work. The fact that when a tributary 
stream enters the main river it passes through a tributary canyon seems to me to 
show conclusively that these gorges were produced by erosion and not by fracture. 

Two papers on the subjects of rock decay 
and erosion, of this year, are worthy of con- 
sideration. Prof. Oliver P. Hubbard, of 
Dartmouth College, during a study of the 
trap dikes, noted that the same could be 
traced continuously across 
the countiy, at varying 
levels, from mountain top to 
From this fact he argued 
that the valleys had been carved out through 
decomposition and erosion since the dikes 
were formed. The difference in altitude at 
the various outcrops gave, then, a measure 
of the amount of erosion. 

Dana's observations, though of a some- 
what different nature, were none the less interesting. In writing on 
denudation in the Pacific, he took the ground that the ocean is power- 
less to excavate valleys along the coast, and that the deep valleys 
like those of Tahiti are due to subaerial decomposition and erosion, 
an observation no geologist of to-day would venture to doubt. 

In March, 1853, b} T resolution of the senate of the State of Califor- 
nia, Dr. John B. Trask was called upon to furnish information in 
relation to the geology of the State. As a result Doctor Trask sub- 
mitted material issued in a pamphlet of 30 pages, pub- 
lished by the assembly in the session of 1853. By a 
joint resolution which passed the senate and assembly 
on May 6, 1853, Trask was authorized to make a further examination 
of some parts of the Sierra Nevada and Coast Range mountains. As 
a result of this and subsequent acts there were issued reports on the 
geology of the region mentioned in 1851, 1855, and 1856.

The classification adopted by Tra.sk was that of the older geologists 
of his time, the rocks being divided merely into Primary, Secondary, 
and Tertiary. Although fossils were found, he did not attempt to 
describe them, and seemed in most cases to fail to realize their value 
as indicative of any particular geological horizon. His ideas regard- 
ing metamorphism were somewhat crude. Thus, he stated in his first 
report: 

■It is a well-known fact that intrusive dikes of trap in passing through limestone 
will change the calcareous formation to true talcose rocks. 

He divided the State into three divisions: First, a primary or cen- 
tral district, included between latitude 3S C 30' and 40° north; second, 
the northern district, included between 40° and 42° north; and third, 
the southern district, included between 38° 30' and 36° north. The 

rocks of the primary district, he stated, are 
for the most part primitive, being composed 
of granite, porphyry, trap, and other allied 
rocks, of which serpentines form the one 
important part. The sedimentary rocks of 
the district were divided into first, argelite 
(sic) slates; second, conglomerates; and 
third, sandstones, the last named being re- 
garded as probably of Miocene age. 

The rocks in the northern district were 
described as of essentially the same charac- 
ter, a few minor differences only being noted. 
The southern district contained many rocks 
in common with the other two, although 
there were in addition many basaltic areas. 
He found a primary limestone in the area between the American and 
Merced rivers, and evidence of at least three successive periods of 
upheaval in this portion of the continent. 

In his second report he described the geology of the most elevated 
portions of the counties of Butte, Sierra, Yuba, Nevada, and Placer; 
also the more southern counties of San Francisco, Santa Clara, Santa 
Cruz, Monterey r ; the north part of San Luis Obispo, Tulare, Mari- 
posa, Tuolumne, Alameda. -Contra Costa, and San Joaquin. During 
the months of October and November he visited Nevada and Calaveras 
counties. He pointed out the .presence of post-Pliocene fossils in 
argillaceous sandstone of the Coast mountains between Point Pinos 
and Nacismiento River. He divided the Tertiary rocks as below:

He had no hesitation in sa} ing that no coal would be found in any 
part of the Coast Range south of the thirty-fifth parallel of north 
latitude, though the presence of a supposed Carboniferous limestone 
in Shasta County led him to express a hope that the desired material 
might yet be found within the limits of the State/ 1 ! In his report for 
L855 the predominating fossiliferous rocks of San Luis Obispo and 
Santa Barbara counties were considered to be of Miocene age. The 
San Bernardino Mountains were described as made up for the most 
part of primitive rocks, granite forming by far the larger part of 
their highest ridges and peaks. 

In this connection it is well to note that, at the request of A. D. 
Bache, of the Coast Survey, W. P. Blake prepared in 1855 a brief 
paper on the physical geology and geography of the coast of Cali- 
fornia from Bodega Bay to San Diego. Blake regarded the sedi- 
mentary rocks of Punta de los Reyes as probably of Miocene age, the 
sandstone at the entrance of San Francisco Bay as Tertiary, and the 
metamorphic rock of the peninsula as an altered sandstone. The ser- 
pentine of Lime Point was shown to be eruptive, as was also the 
granite of C} T press Point and the Bay of San Carlos, and younger 
than the conglomerate. 

This same year (1853) there was organized a geological survey of Mis- 
souri with G. C. Swallow at its head, and Dr. A. Litton, F. B. Meek, 
Maj. F. Hawn, and Dr. B. F. Shumard as assistants. Five reports 
were published. The first, bearing the date Novem- 

Swallow's Geological _ L . „ . r _, . 

survey of Missouri, ber 10. 18o3, consisted of but tour pages. Ihe second, 

dated 1854, comprised over 400 pages, including the 

reports of the assistants above mentioned. None of the sections nor 

maps given were colored, nor w T ere any new principles or striking 

" These hopes were partially realized, lignite coal, but of Cretaceous age, having 
been found and to some extent worked in Alameda, Amador, Contra Costa, Fresno, 
Kern, Monterey, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties.

features brought out. The work as :i whole is an extremely uninter- 
esting array of details, essential to the geographical extension of geo- 
logical knowledge. Some space was devoted to economic geology, a 
consideration of soils, etc. Doctor Litton's report consisted almost 
wholly of details of lead, copper, and iron mines. Perhaps the most 
important economic item in Meek's report was his calling attention 
to the limited area of the coal beds, which lie in narrow basins in the 
encrinal limestone. 

The third annual report of progress (6 pages) appeared in 1857, 
the fourth (14 pages) in 1859, and the fifth (19 pages) in 1861. G. C. 
Broadhead, who later was himself State geologist, became an assistant 
during 1857-1861, J. G. Norwood in 1858-1861, Henry Engelmann in 
1857, and Dr. John Locke in 1860. 

During the period which intervened between the publication of the 
second report and the stopping of the survey in 1861, a large portion 

of the State had been visited by members of 
the corps, and full reports were written on 
the following counties: Cape Girardeau, 
Perry, St. Genevieve, Jefferson, Crawford, 
Phelps, Pulaski, Laclede, Wright, Ozark 
(including Douglas), Clark, Morgan, Miller, 
Saline, Chariton, Macon, Randolph, Shelby, 
Osage, and Maries. 

After the survey had been discontinued 
the legislature authorized L. D. Morse and 
G. C. Swallow to publish all the results of 
the work of the previous seven years, but 
the project was abandoned on account of 
the expense. 

While nearly all the State and land-office 
surveys organized up to 1850 had economic ends in view, and while, 
further, numerous papers of a more or less economic character had 
appeared from the. hands of various writers from time to time, yet 
j. D.Whitney's literature relating to American ore deposits remained 
tn^united states J scant and of an extremely unsatisfactory character. 
,854 * The appearance in 1854 of Whitney's Metallic 

Wealth of the United States marked, therefore, an important epoch. 
The work comprised upward of 500 octavo pages, and though writ- 
ten with especial reference to the ore deposits of the United States, 
contained references to those of all the principal foreign localities as 
well and remained the standard work of reference up to the time of 
the appearance of Kemp's Ore Deposits of the United States in 1893. 
Man} T of the principles set down by Whitney have, naturally, been

shown to be erroneous, as he himself lived to recognize, 'fhus, 
regarding the occurrence of gold, he wrote: 

[n general it may be said that the older the geological formation the greater the 
probability of its containing valuable ores and metals. 

And further: 

There is room for doubt whether the great gold deposits of the world did not 
originate exclusivelyin the Paleozoic strata, since we are not aware that the rocks 
which have been proved to be of Azoic age have been found to be auriferous. 

In this, it will be noted, he followed the teaching of Murchison. 

To the reader of to-day it will seem scarcely possible that, at the 
date of Whitney's writing - , there were no mines worked for silver 
alone in the United States, the supply of the metal coming almost 
wholly from the native gold of California. Argentiferous galena had 
been worked to a slight extent, as at the Washington mine in David- 
son County, North Carolina, but work was suspended at the time 
of his writing. How little the silver resources of the West were 
realized is shown by Whitney's comment on the rapid increase of the 
gold output from year to year and the comparative decrease in that of 
silver. He wrote: 

Silver is, in a geological point of view, the metal best adapted for a standard of 
value, since, possessing all the valuable qualities which make gold suitable for that 
purpose, it is not liable to those fluctuations in its production to which this latter is 
exposed. There is no discovery of a new continent to he looked forward to whose 
mines shall deluge the world with silver, and any increase in the amount of this 
metal produced must come chiefly from the working of mining regions already 
known. 

Yet Whitney himself lived to see the annual output of American 
silver become so great as to practically remove it from the list of 
precious metals and cause it to be rejected for all but subsidiary coinage. 

Whitney recognized the fact that none of the. deposits of lead in the 
Mississippi Valley could be considered as coining under the head of 
true veins (i. e., fissure veins), and that the productive deposits did 
not generally exceed a hundred feet in thickness in the Galena (Lower 
Silurian) limestone immediately overlying the Trenton. No ore of 
consequence was known to occur in the so-called "Blue Limestone" 
(Trenton, Bird's-eye, Chazy, and Black River) and it was not consid- 
ered probable that the fissures would ever be found to extend through 
the intervening sandstone into the Lower Magnesian beds. Sinking 
through the sand into these latter beds was, therefore, considered as 
mere random exploration and a foolish enterprise. 

He classified the ore deposits as (1) simple alluvial deposits which 
were recognized as residual from the decomposing limestone; (2) 
deposits in vertical fissures which had a very limited longitudinal 
extent, and (3) deposits in flat sheets. All of these were regarded as 



440 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

deposits from aqueous solution which took place either in depressions 
of the surface or in vertical fissures of the nature of gash veins pro- 
duced by the shrinkage of the calcareous strata." 

These views differed from the more modern in that it is now deemed 
as. probable that the ores were first precipitated in an ocean in which 
they were held in solution as sulphates and reduced to sulphides 
through the decomposing organic matter; that subsequently, through 
the action of percolating surface waters, the same were once more 
oxidized, segregated in the fissures, and reduced a second time to the 
condition of sulphides. The production of the mines in the Missis- 
sippi Valley he regarded as having even then reached its maximum. 

Whitney recognized the eruptive nature of the Iron Mountain 
masses of Missouri, and apparently regarded the hematite ores of the 
Lake Superior region as also of an eruptive nature (see also p. 417), 
though the later work of Van Hise has shown them to have had a 
chemical origin. Concerning the specular and magnetic iron ores of 
New York, he thought to have found the evidence of direct eruptive 
origin as perhaps less conspicuous, many exhibiting appearances of 
secondary action, such as might have been brought about by volcanic 
agencies and powerful currents which swept awa} T and abraded por- 
tions of the original eruptive masses, "rearranging their particles and 
depositing them again in the depressions of the strata." The lenticu- 
lar beds of ore occurring parallel with the stratification were particu- 
larly referred to as originating in this way. 

A year later (November, 1855) Whitney had in the American Jour- 
nal of Science an article on the changes which take place in the struc- 
ture and composition of mineral veins, which is of interest in connec- 
tion with the recent revival of the subject of secondary enrichment of 
ore deposits. He here described the now well-known copper deposits 
of Ducktown, Tennessee, and the superficial alteration of the vein 
matter, and called attention to the fact that the black ore, then being 
mined, was formed by a process of natural concentration by surface 
water, which was constantly decomposing the material above the per- 
manent water level and carrying it downward to the point where it 
was stopped by the solid portion of the vein. By this means a large 
portion of the copper once disseminated throughout perhaps 100 feet 
of A^ein stone 'had become concentrated into a thickness of perhaps 2 
or 3 feet. 

In June, 1854, Lewis Harper, or properly, Ludwig Hafner, was 
elected by the trustees to the chair of geology in the University of 

«Dr. Henry King, in a sketch of the geology of the Mississippi Valley, read before 
the Association of American Geologists and Naturalists in 1844, and printed in the 
American Journal of Science for that year, argued that the ores of zinc, copper, and 
lead occurring in the Cliff limestone were deposited contemporaneously with the 
inclosing rock.

Mississippi, which act, under the law, constituted him also as State 
geologist, and Milling-ton, whose work is mentioned on p. 4M<>, was 
forced to resign. 

Harper's Work in . , 

Mississippi, In 1855 Harper was relieved <>i a portion ot his 

duties as instructor in the university in order that he 
might personally take the field, and an appropriation of $1,000 secured 
for the employment of an assistant geologist, which place was offered 
to Eugene W. llilgard, then fresh from studies at Heidelberg. Hilgard 
and Harper worked together during the season of 1855, but the dual 
position of State geologist and professor in the university proved un- 
satisfactory to the trustees; the law was repealed in 1856, and Harper 
also forced to resign, though Hilgard was continued as an assistant. 

At the legislative session of 1856-57 Harper succeeded in securing 
the passage of an act providing for the printing of the second annual 
report of the agricultural and geological survey of the State and for 
other purposes. This resulted in a complete separation of the survey 
from all connection with the State university, the establishment of a 
geological survey, and the office of a State geologist at a salary of 
$2,000 a year, with an appropriation of $1,200 for fitting up a chem- 
ical laboratory. Three thousand live hundred dollars was appropriated 
for the publication of Harper's report. Concerning this report, Hil- 
gard remarks: 

It need only be said that it is a literary, linguistic, and scientific curiosity, and 
probably unique in official publications of its kind. It was the labored effort of a 
sciolist to show erudition, and to compass the impossible feat of interpreting and dis- 
cussing intelligently a considerable mass of observations, mostly recorded by another, 
working on a totally different plan from himself. 

The report contained a colored geological map of the State which, 
though less detailed, corresponded in a general way with that pub- 
lished later (1800) by Hilgard. Indeed, there is every reason for sup- 
posing that the map itself was compiled largely from Hilgard's notes. 
The work, like its predecessor, had little influence upon geological 
thought, and was, if not ignored, unfavorably reviewed by the journals 
of the day. The circulation of this report throughout the State 
brought discredit upon its author to such an extent that, toward the 
end of the year (1857), he was obliged to resign his office." 

"This Geological Report on Mississippi is very unequal in its different parts and 
requires a careful revision before it can become good authority. Many of the sections 
have a fantastic boxing off of layers which is quite unintelligible to us. Certain 
rocks are pronounced to be Carboniferous, because the genus })roductus occurring in 
them is not known to exist, the author says, in older strata. Some peculiar concen- 
tric aggregations in clay are attributed to whirlpools in the waters. The work argues 
against the subdivisions of the Eocene proposed by Conrad on very insufficient data 
and an evident want of appreciation of the subject. There are errors, also, in the 
identification of the Cretaceous, Tertiary, and post-Tertiary beds which betray insuf- 
ficient observations and an imperfect acquaintance with the science. (Am. Jour. Sci.) 



442 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Under an act of the Wisconsin legislature, approved March 25, 1853, 
Edward Daniels was appointed State geologist, but at the end of the 
year was superseded by Dr. J. G. Percival, whose work in Connecticut 
has been already referred to (p. 329). Daniels's tirst 
wiiconsl^jsM 11 il,ia only annual report, bearing date of 1854, con- 
sisted of a small octavo pamphlet of 82 pages, devoted 
largely to a consideration of the lead tields. One geological section 
in black and white was given, extending across the lead mines from 
the Mississippi River opposite Dubuque to the Blue Mounds. The 
rocks were classified, beginning with the uppermost, as (1) coralline 
beds, (2) gray limestone, (3) blue limestone, (4) buff limestone, (5) 
sandstone, (6) lower magnesian limestone, and (7) the sandstone of the 
Wisconsin River. A vertical section was also given showing the suc- 
cession and relative thickness of the rocks underlying the lead regions. 
In this last the gray limestone was given as the prevailing "surface 
rock of the mines, containing veins of lead, and, in its lower beds, 
zinc and copper." 

Daniels found evidence, as he thought, to strengthen the conjecture 
of Owen to the effect that the Lower Magnesian limestone would be 
found to contain lead ore in workable quantities. 

Aside from the above-noted publication, Daniels was the author of 
an article on the Iron Ores of Wisconsin, in the report of the geolog- 
ical survey of Wisconsin for 1857 (62 pages), and a brief note regard- 
ing the lead district of Wisconsin, which appeared in the Proceedings 
of the Boston Society of Natural History in 1854. 

According to Hall, Daniels in 1855 tirst pointed out the unconformity 
of the western coal measures with the older rocks, though J. W. Fos- 
ter in 1856 published a section showing a similar unconformity, the 
discovery of which he credited to Norwood. 

Doctor Percival, who succeeded Daniels, received his appointment in 

August, 1854, and served until the time of his death, which occurred 

on May 2, 1856. Two reports, in the form of octavo pamphlets of 

about 100 pages each, were issued as the result of his 

Percival's Geological 1 • • r^. 

Survey of Wisconsin, work. Like his previous work in Connecticut, these 
reports are extremely prosy and made up largely of 
very minute descriptions of the lithological nature of the various rock 
formations of the State, their geographic distribution and relative posi- 
tion. Fossils were mentioned only occasionally, and, otherwise than 
his reference to them as primary and secondary rocks, there is no sug- 
gestion as to their probable geological age, with the exception of the 
reference in the second report to the fact that the so-called ''Mound 
limestone' 1 had been regarded from its fossils as equivalent to the 
Niagara limestone. The character of the ore deposits, and the posi- 
tion, number, and character of the veins were noted with great detail, 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1850-1859. 448 

;iiid in a single instance lie indulged in ;i little speculation regarding 
the origin of the ore: 

The appearances seem n<> less to indicate the origin of the mineral and the accom- 
panying ores from beneath, probably from the primary rocks underlying the lowest 

secondary; and that they rose in such a condition that they were diffused through 
;i certain definite extent of the materials of the rocks, and then segregated in their 
present form, and this along certain lines which have determined their arrangement. 

April 8, 1854, D. D. Owen was appointed State geologist of Ken- 
tucky, a position which he continued to till until the time of his death 
in I860. During this time there were issued four large octavo reports, 
comprising, all told, upward of 2,000 pages, with 

Owen's Geological , „ „ 

survey of Kentucky, sections, maps, and plates of fossils. Owen was 
assisted at first by Dr. Robert Peter, chemist, and 
Sidney T. Lyon, topographer; later, Leo Lesquereux, paleobotanist. 
E. T. Cox, geologist, and Joseph Lesley, topographer, were added to 
the force. 

Owen divided the formations of the State as follows, beginning 
with the uppermost: (1) Superficial deposits, ('2) the Coal Measures, 
(3) sub-Carboniferous limestone, (4) Black lingula shales, (5) Gray 
coraline falls limestone, (6) the Chain coral and Upper Cliff limestone, 
and (7) the Blue, Shell, and Bird's-eye limestone, the last named being 
the most ancient of any yet found within the State limits. 

As with a majority of Owen's works, these reports are given up 
largely to economic matters, to descriptions of the coal, iron ores, 
building stones, and other useful minerals. 

A local epidemic of milk sickness in cattle was examined into in 
considerable detail by Owen, who concluded that the disease was 
'•intimately connected with the geological formation, 11 and probably 
due to the presence of soluble salts of aluminum, iron, and magnesia, 
produced in the shales by the decomposition of iron pyrites. He 
showed an amusing tendency to magnify the importance of minor 
matters in suggesting that the animals at pasture may have become 
weakened and peculiarly susceptible to disease through breathing, 
while feeding with the nostrils close to the ground, an atmosphere 
deficient in oxygen, the abstraction of this element being due to the 
oxidation of the pyrite in the surface rock. 

Concerning the roe or oolitic structure of the sub-Carboniferous 
limestone, he wrote, the structure "seems to have been formed in 
eddies where the water circled round in spiral or funnel-shaped cur- 
rents which kept particles of line sand revolving in such a manner 
that they acquired concentric calcareous coatings, until, having attained 
the size of fish roe, their gravity was sufficient to overcome the power 
of suspension of the rotary currents, when they sunk to the bottom. 11 
In consideration of the fact that this oolitic structure is now known

to prevail over many hundred square miles of area, this explanation 
seems scarcely sufficient. 

Peter's work on the chemical composition of the soil was very 
thorough, and, taken all in all, the work done by this survey on prob- 
lems relating to the soil was of greater importance than any previously 
produced. The method followed by Doctor Peter himself has, how- 
ever, been proven by recent Avork to be of comparatively little value, 
the fertility of a soil, as announced years earlier by Emmons, being 
dependent more upon its physical than chemical properties. 

In 1855 G. G. Shumard accompanied, in the capacity of geologist, 
the expedition under command of Captain Pope for the purpose of 
boring artesian wells upon the western plains along the line of the 
g. g. shumard's thirty-second parallel. An abstract of his report was 
withVope'T" 6 ' 1 ' 00 given in the Transactions of the St. Louis Academy of 
Expedition, 1855. s c i enceSj I, 1856-1860, though, so far as can be ascer- 
tained, no final report ever appeared. 

Shumard announced the finding of Permian fossils about 30 miles 

above the mouth of Delaware Creek, in the 
country lying between the Rio Pecos and 
the Rio Grande. At Delaware Creek the 
oldest rocks were Cretaceous, overlaid by 
Quaternary. The Guadalupe Mountains he 
described as consisting of white, gray, and 
bluish-black limestone, containing fossils, 
some of which appeared to belong to the 
Coal Measures and others to the Permian, 
the beds being finally set down as of Permian 
age. The Sierra Alto was shown to have a 
granitic nucleus, from which the stratified 
rocks dip away on either side. 

Silurian rocks were found in the El Paso 
Mountains, and the Jornada del Muerto was 
shown to be a small trough composed mostl} T of limestone, sandstone, 
and shales, covered to a depth of 5 or feet with loose detritus. 
The upheaved edges of these underlying strata formed the mountains 
on either side. The Organ Mountains were shown to be of limestone, 
belonging to the Coal Measures. 

By an act of the legislature of the State of South Carolina in 1855 

Oscar M. Lieber was appointed director of the geological, mineral- 

ogical, and agricultural survey of the State, a position which he held 

up to 1860. During this period he made four annual 

south Carolina, reports, the first bearing date of 1857 and the last 1860. 

I8SS-1860 

This, it will be remembered, was the third survey of 
the State undertaken at public expense, the first being purely agricul- 
tural, under the direction of Edmund Ruffin, and the second geological 
and agricultural, under direction of M. Tuomey.

AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1850-1851). 445 

In the reports of Lieber matters of both theoretic and economic 
nature received attention, though an undue amount of space was per- 
haps devoted to a discussion of the itacolumite, which he considered 
to be a true sandstone. He differed in this respect with Mr. Tuomey. 
Its flexibility he regarded as not due to decomposition, but rather to 
its fineness of grain and admixture of mica or talc, delicately laminated 
structure, and a certain degree of compactness in the constituents of 
each lamina. In this he was mistaken. He discussed the origin of the 
rock, and compared it with the itacolumite of Brazil in its relation to 
the diamond. 

A peculiar tendency on the part of Lieber to use outlandish terms, 
particularly Brazilian Portuguese, is manifested in this report. Thus, 
in his paper on the itacolumite and its associated rocks, he mentions 
finding the "tapanhoancanga, or canga, which sometimes passed into a 
reddish quader-sandstone." He also wrote of the u oryctogno$tie" 
composition of the rock, and designated a prospector as a u costeaner." 
He classified the igneous rocks of the State, commencing with the 
newest, as: 

I Eurite and quartz porphyry (?). 
Trachytic rocks: I Coarse trachyte of eastern Lancaster. 

I Domite, phonolith. 
Trappean rocks: Diorite and Diorite slate, soapstone (?), Talcose trap (?). 
Melaphyre, Egeran (?). 
Aphanitic porphyry. 

Coarse-grained granite, etc., of Taxahaw (syenite). 
Other granite and gneiss. 
(The marks of interrogation with some of these denote that their exact relative 
position is not estahlished. ) 

Lieber's views regarding mineral veins and ore deposits were largely 
influenced by those of European authorities, but, nevertheless, he 
entertained certain independent ideas which at this date are instruct- 
ive. He believed with Werner that the veins were tilled crevices, but 
thought them to have been tilled from below rather than from above; 
that is, the minerals constituting the veins he regarded as having 
been derived from the interior of the planet and brought to the sur- 
face by mineral waters or steam, where they Avere deposited chiefly 
in the crevices themselves, the surplus only distributing itself among 
the surface waters, whence it was afterward precipitated. 

He argued against the idea that the veins had been tilled by the 
leaching action of water permeating the rocks on either side, saying: 

Entirely the reverse is, however, the case. Thus, minerals which belong to the 
veins but which are found in the country were in reality derived from the former; 
the vein crevices were the first reservoirs, and the few scattering particles of the min- 
erals of tlie veins which we find in the adjacent country rocks found their way into 
the latter by elimination or secretion and by sublimation from the surcharged vein 
crevices. 



Granites: 



446 REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Concerning the variation in vein structure and the changes of the 
contents of veins at various depths, he wrote: 

Except in those few cases where the enrichment of a vein is due to extraneous or 
superficial causes, we may safely say that veins gain in the quantity of their metal- 
liferous contents as we leave the surface; that is to say, the lodes increase in diameter 
and in the compactness of their ores. 

Thus do we find one who was the best authority in the State promul- 
gating a theory wholly erroneous and misleading. 

The question of the origin of gold received consideration, and the 
opinion was expressed that "the gold in some igneous rocks with us 
and elsewhere may have been brought up with the fluid masses from 
beneath, but it may also have been imparted by the solution of 
auriferous sedimentary rocks traversed at the period of injection." 
While noting that dikes exerted a conspicuous influence on the dis- 
cernible presence of gold, he believed that these did not impart the 
metal, or if they did, only in exceptional cases, and that as a rule cer- 
tain sedimentary rocks must be regarded as the true source of the gold 
into which it was infused at the time of their deposition, though by what 
means or from what source he found it impossible even to guess. 

Each of the reports was accompanied by two or more colored geog- 
nostic maps, in which the various formations were grouped according 
to their lithological nature rather than according to their geological age. 

In 1855 there appeared Dawson's Acadian Geology, a small octavo 
volume of but 388 pages, but which, through successive editions, grew, 
by 1878, to nearly 800 pages. This in all its editions was by far the 
most important production of this most prolific writer.^ 
Sy, s i8ss dian Tne edition of 1855 contained a colored geological 
map of the region and purported to give in a con- 
densed form what was known of the more general features of the 
peninsula. A discussion of the views held, and as subsequently mod- 
ified, can well be reserved until we come to the edition of 1878. 

A very large proportion of Dawson's geological papers related to 
the Coal Measures of Nova Scotia and their included plant and animal 
remains. His first publications on these subjects date back to 1843. 
As early as 1853 he announced, in connection with 
Nova S s"o S ti^? rk '" Lyell, the finding, at the base of an upright fossil tree 
1853=1865. trunk . n thege Coa] MeasureSi f bones identified by 

Jeffries Wyman and Richard Owen as those of a reptile or batrachian, 
to which the name Dendrerpeton acadian kih was applied. The finding 
of the shell of a terrestrial mollusk was also announced at the same time. 
Dawson also made important observations regarding the origin of the 
various coal beds. He felt that the conditions indicated the existence 
at one time of a long succession of oscillations between terrestrial and 

a Dawson's bibliography contains upward of 360 titles, of which at least nine 
were books. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1850-1859. 



U7 



aquatic circumstances, which were not accompanied by any material 
permanent change in the nature of the surface of the land and its 
organized inhabitants. He conceived that the elevation and depression 
of large areas were not absolutely contemporaneous, but such that by 
a mere change of place one could have passed from a coal swamp to a 
modiola lagoon or a tidal sand Hat. 

In the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society for 1859 Daw- 
son had another important paper on the vegetable - structures in the 
coal in which he announced that the vegetable matter of these beds 
consists principally of Sigillaria? and Calamitea?. With these, how- 
ever, he found intermixed remains of many other plants. 

The structure of the coal as he here found it conformed to the view 
that the materials were accumulated by growth in place without any 
driftage of materials. The rate of accumulation he thought to have 
been very slow, the climate of the period being such that the true coni- 
fers grew not more rapidly than their modern congeners. Making all 
due allowances, he felt safe in asserting that every foot of thickness of 
pure bituminous coal implied the growth and fall of at least fifty gen- 
erations of Sigillaria? and, therefore, an undisturbed condition of forest 
growth enduring through many centuries. 

In this same journal for 1865, under the title of On the Conditions 
of the Deposition of Coal, he again referred to the subject. Writing 
with reference only to the beds of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick 
and their associated sediments, he showed that the coarser matter of 
the Carboniferous rocks was derived from the neighboring metamor- 
phic ridges, but much of the finer material was probably drifted from 
more distant sources. He thought there was no good reason to doubt 
that in the Carboniferous period the greater part of the Laurentian 
and Silurian districts of North America existed as land. Considering 
the relative position and lithological nature of the beds of the Car- 
boniferous period, and comparing them with those of other periods of 
the Paleozoic age in eastern America, he thought to find indications of 
the existence of periodic cycles such that similar beds were deposited at 
corresponding periods in each, the parallelism being tabulated as below:

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



Jules Marcou's 
Geological Map of 
the United States, 

1853. 



In an article communicated to the Natural History Society of 
Montreal in I860, Dawson claimed to recognize ''among the partially 
metamorphosed sub-Carboniferous rocks of Nova Scotia, formations 
ranging from the Middle Silurian to the Lower Devonian, inclusive, 
bat of a more argillaceous and less calcareous character than the series 
occupying this position in the mainland of America." The granites 
(intrusives) he regarded as of newer Devonian age, and the Arisaig 
series as representing "the upper part of the Middle Silurian, proba- 
bly with a part of the Upper Silurian, a position much lower than that 
assigned to it in my Acadian Geology."" 

In 1853 Jules Marcou, a Frenchman who had come to America in 
1848, published a geological map of the United States and the British 
Provinces of North America, with 92 octavo pages of explanatory 
text, two geological sections, and eight plates of the 
fossils which characterize the formations. The map. 
which was colored by hand, extended as far west as 
the one hundred and sixth meridian, and the geological sections, not 

colored, extended, the first from the Atlantic 
Ocean at Yorktown, Virginia, to Fort Lara- 
mie, Nebraska, and the second from Lake 
St. Johns in the Hudson Ba} T Territory to 
Mobile, Alabama. 

The author adopted the formation names 
established by M. de Verneuil and Murchi- 
son, in order to render possible a satisfactory 
comparison with the existing geological 
maps of England, Germany, Russia, Scan- 
dinavia, and Bohemia. The divisions Cam- 
brian and Taconic, however, were not recog- 
nized, since, in the opinion of the compiler, 
the}^ "ought to disappear from geological 
classification, for they give two names to the 
metamorphic rocks, of which they are integrant parts, in all regions 
where these beds have been observed."" 

Perhaps the most striking feature of the map, at least that in which 
it differs the most from those of later date, lay in the enormous devel- 
opment of the Devonian, which is made to occupy a large portion of 
southern New York, as now, and to extend thence in a continuous, 
broad, but gradually narrowing band southwesterly to near Tusca- 
loosa, in Alabama. A continuous belt was also indicated as extending 
from the east side of the south end of Lake Michigan westerly nearly 
to the Missouri River. The brown Triassic sandstones of the Eastern 
States were colored as Keuper (yellow), and the belt west of Rich- 




Fig. 58. — Jules Marcou. 



" This statement regarding the Taconic is a little surprising when one considers 
the part Marcou played in the subsequent controversy (see p. 659). 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1850-1859. 449 

mond and one near Raton Mountains, in New Mexico, as Lias or 
Jurassic (blue). A band of Keuper was also represented as extending 
from the eastern end of the south shore of Lake Superior quite across 
the Co tea u des Prairies to the ninety-eighth meridian. A continuous 
band, colored as composed of granite porphyry, syenite, greenstone, 
gneiss, mica-schist, etc., was represented as extending from below the 
twenty -fourth parallel in Mexico northward to the great bend of the 
North Platte in Wyoming, where it was overlain by Silurian, Devo- 
nian, Coal Measures, and Keuper strata, the latter flanked on the north 
by a broad band of "copper trap/' Here again the series extended 
westerly to the edge of the map and northeasterly to a point about 
midway between Mandan and the Little Missouri River in Dakota. 

This attempt on the part of Marcou was certainly commendable, 
requiring courage as well as judgment. Unfortunately, Marcou does 
not seem to have used discretion in all cases in the selection of his 
authorities, and made altogether too sweeping generalizations, often 
in direct contradiction of facts made known by other workers. 

In 1855, 1858, and again in 1872 Marcou published in German}^ and 
France other editions of his map, in which he comprised the whole 
country from the Atlantic to the Pacitic Ocean. Perhaps the most 
striking feature of these issues is the enormous area of country west 
of the Missouri at Iowa and extending almost to Great Salt Lake and 
the Colorado River in Arizona, colored as red sandstone (Trias), with 
broad intercalations of Jurassic. This feature is the same on issues 
of both 1855 and 1858, although in the map of 1853 he colored the 
same area (at least as far as this map extended) Cretaceous, Tertiary, 
:ind Quaternary. In the edition of 1855 the entire west coast of Cali- 
fornia south of Humboldt and as far down as Monterey was colored as 
occupied by eruptive and metamorphic rocks, while broad belts in the 
interior, along the courses of the main rivers, were colored as Tertiary. 
In the edition of 1858 this was in part corrected, the Tertiary being 
extended to the coast. 

The various editions of these maps, on account of the errors men- 
tioned and numerous others perhaps even more inexcusable, though 
less conspicuous, were severely criticised by American geologists, a 
particularly harsh review of the 1853 map being given b\ T James Hall 
in the American Journal of Science for March, 1854, and of that of 
1855 by W. P. Blake in the same journal for November, 1856. 

During 1853 numerous expeditions were sent out by the War 

Department for the purpose of exploring routes for 

su^y C s^ C 853-i™sl tne proposed railroad from the Mississippi Valley to 

the Pacific coast. These were in all cases under the 

immediate command of officers of the Army, but to nearly all one or 

more naturalists or geologists were attached.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



The published results of these explorations, geological and other- 
wise, form the thirteen quarto volumes of Pacific Railroad Reports, 
so well known to all naturalists. Among those who accompanied the 
expeditions and whose reports gave almost the first authoritative and 
systematic accounts of the geology of the regions passed over were 
Jules Marcou, whose geological map has been mentioned; W. P. Blake, 
of New Haven, Connecticut; Thomas Antisell, James Schiel. and J. S. 
Newberry.

surveys. 

Marcou received his appointment in May, 1853, with orders to join 
Lieut. A. W. Whipple in the exploration of a route near the thirty- 
fifth parallel of latitude. The route followed lay by way of Fort 
Smith, Arkansas; westward through Albuquerque and Santa Fe, New 
Mexico, to Los Angeles, California, and occupied the period between 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1850-1859. 451 

June 2, 1853, and March 26, 1854. On returning to Washington, 
June 1, 1854, Marcou, on the plea of ill health, asked permission to 
Marcou-s work in work U P nis results in Europe; and. acting apparently 
Paci"fc t R aUroa t d h the unae r a misunderstanding, proceeded to pack his own 
surveys, 1853. collections, together with others made by the party 
under Captain Pope along the thirty-second parallel, and made prep- 
arations to leave the country on September 27. This procedure seems, 
however, to have displeased the then Secretary of War (Jefferson 
Davis), who insisted, under date of September 25, that the report be 
made out in this country. It being then too late, as claimed, for Mr. 
Marcou to change his plans, he was allowed to depart, but instructed 
under threat of prosecution to turn over all collections and notebooks, 
the property of the Government, to the accredited representative of 
the United States at Paris. Naturally this treatment aroused con- 
siderable indignation on the part of Marcou, though it is doubtful if 
he was justified in his subsequent proceedings. Such of the collections 
and notes as were returned were placed in the hands of W. P. Blake 
to be worked up, but, while there is no reason for criticising the latter, 
the report was not all that could have been desired." It is a painful 
fact, moreover, that none of Marcou's types were returned to America, 
but were, by him, distributed to English and continental museums, 
one of the collections being now in the possession of the Geological 
Society of London. 

Before leaving for Europe, however, and before becoming aware of 
the intentions of the Secretary of War, Marcou made two brief reports 
or summaries— one of the route traversed by himself, and the other on 
the materials collected by Captain Pope's party. These were pub- 
lished in House Document No. 129 and were republished, together 
with other papers by the same author, in Zurich in 1858, under the 
title of Geology of North America, with Two Reports on the Prairies 
of Arkansas and Texas, the Rocky Mountains of New Mexico and the 
Sierra Nevada of California. The latter work was accompanied by a 
geological map of the United States and a section across the country 
from Fort Smith to the Pacific Ocean, the same being a reprint of a 
map published by him in 1855 in the Bulletin of the Geological Society 
of France and in the Annales des Mines for the same year. (Referred 
to on p. 449.) It also contained a colored map of an area from 35 to 
75 miles in width across New Mexico along the thirty-fifth parallel, 
bearing date of 1857, and a reproduction of Maclure's map, the original 
of which bore date of 1809. 

In this summary Marcou identified certain horizontal beds overlying 
the Carboniferous limestones as Triassic, a formation w 7 hich on the 

«Marcou's original notes and Blake's translation of the same were published in 
parallel columns in the third volume of the Pacific Railroad Reports.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, U>04. 



basis of his geological map of the United States, published in Boston 
in 1853, above noted, he claimed to have been the first to recognize in 
the West. He divided it into three divisions, the lowest of which he 
considered as equivalent to the red sandstones of Lake Superior (now 
considered as Cambrian), the Bay of Fundy, the Prince Edward and 
Magdalen islands, and a part of that of Virginia and New Jersey. At 
Pyramid Mount, in the Llano Estacado, he claimed to have found 
Jurassic rocks overlying conformably the Keuper (the first discovery 
of rocks of this horizon in America), and at Galisteo, in New Mexico, 
the White Chalk division of the Cretaceous. From the fact that the 
Cretaceous beds lie unconformably upon the upheaved Triassic and 
Jurassic beds, he concluded that the same were deposited after the 
principal dislocation of the Rocky Mountains, which took place at the 
end of the Jurassic period. 

The Sierra Nevada he rightly inferred to be of more recent uplift 
than the Rocky Mountains, probably dating from the end of the 

Miocene or Pliocene, and the Coast Range 
from the end of the Eocene. 

To W. P. Blake fell the lot of accompany- 
ing Lieutenant Williamson, whose route led 
from San Francisco southward along the San 
Joaquin River, through San Francisco Pass 
in the mountains to the Mohave River, and 
workofw.P.eiake eastward along the thirty- 
ESESSHSSE* second and thirty-third par- 

Surveys, 1853-1856. a H c l s to tllC UlOUth of the 

Gila. The region, as pointed out by S. F. 
Emmons," "is not one from which definite 
geological data could be obtained," the rocks, 
with the exception of recent and Tertiary 
formations, being barren and classed as 
metamorphic and eruptive. He however noted the wide-spread occur- 
rence of Tertiary rocks about San Francisco and in southern Cali- 
fornia and the occurrence of eruptive serpentinous rocks. He also 
made man}' interesting minor observations on the polishing and groov- 
ing of -hard rocks by wind-blown sand and other desert phenomena. 
Mountains of the isolated or "lost mountain' 1 type were described, 
and the fact that the Colorado Desert was below the level of the sea 
noted. The age of the coast mountains was determined as at least 
post-Pliocene, and the impregnation of the rocks of the region with 
gold he regarded as having been contemporaneous with the uplift.

AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1850-1859. 453 

To Blake, too, fell the study of the collections made by Pope's expe- 
dition along the route near the thirty -second parallel. It was the 
original intention of Pope that this work should be done b} 7 Marcou, 
but owing to the decision of Davis, then Secretary of War, the collec- 
tions were returned by Marcou, as already noted, "in a confused con- 
dition and with many of the labels displaced" and given to Blake. 

Captain Pope's route extended from Preston on the Red River in a 
southwesterly direction to the Pecos River, and thence nearly due 
west to the vallej^ of the Rio Grande at El Paso and Dona Ana in New 
Mexico, crossing the Organ, Huerco, and Guadalupe mountains. The 
result of this expedition was to establish the Carboniferous character 
of the limestone of the Organ Mountains, the prevailing granitic type 
of the Huerco Range, and the presumable Carboniferous age of the 
limestone and sandstone of the Guadalupes (see also Shumard's obser- 
vations, p. 434). The underlying formations of the Llano Estaeado 
were judged from the specimens to be probably Cretaceous and not 
Jurassic, as mapped by Marcou. For the geology of the region 
between Llano Estaeado and Preston, Blake drew largely on Shumard's 
publications. 

The origin of the gypsum beds he regarded as due to the action on 
the underlying limestone of percolating waters containing sulphuric 
acid derived from the decomposition of pyrites. 

Thomas Antisell accompanied the party under command of Lieut. 

J. G. Parke, surveying the route in southern California to connect 

with the routes near the thirty-fifth and thirty-second parallels and 

also the route near the thirty-second parallel between 

Antis£u rk ° f the Rio Grande and Pinias Village, v which was explored 

by^ Parker in 1854-55. 

Antisell recognized the post-Miocene age of the final uplift of the 
Coast Range and thought that the elevating force must have taken 
place from two points, one in the north and one in the south, and that 
the forces became gradually spent as the} T passed, one in a southerly 
and the other in a northerly direction toward each other. He con- 
ceived that this resulted in an uplifting of the consolidated crust of 
the State at either end, while the center remained quiescent, causing 
thereby a rupture of the superficial strata, or even a depression below 
sea level near the middle, forming thus San Francisco Bay. 

Influenced to some extent by Eliecle Beaumont's theory of mountain 
uplift and the relative age of mountain ranges, as indicated by their 
parallelism, he, without committing himself in any way, called atten- 
tion to the north and south trend of all the New Mexican ranges and 
northwest and southeast trend of the Sierras, the Coast Range, and 
the ranges of Nevada. 

No Paleozoic rocks were recognized in the southern part of the 
State. The sandstone underlying the Carboniferous limestone of the 



454 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



Gila region, New Mexico, was thought to be Devonian, though no 
fossils were found by which the age might be definitely proven. What 
fossils were collected during this expedition were described by Conrad 
and were all Tertiary forms. 

As with Hitchcock and other of the early workers, he failed to real- 
ize the full capabilities of river action during gradual crustal move- 
ment, and found the same difficulty in accounting for the course of 
the Gila that Hitchcock did with that of the Connecticut (p. 310). 

During the series of elevations [he wrote] which finally uplifted this range (the 
Pinaleno) to its present altitude, the upheaving force must have been exerted even 
upon the southern portion of the range, raising the table-land of northern Sonora 
and Chiricahua to so great a height. This strain may have produced a fissure from 
east to west, or cracked and perhaps depressed the strata along parallel 33°, and 
thus enabled the Gila to take that as a permanent course. Some such catastrophe 
must have occurred, for it is scarcely probable that the river unaided Could have 
cut through such lofty hills and hard rocks as it appears to have done in its passage 
through these mountains, running as it does at right angles to the strike of the 
ranges. 

Antisell's report was accompanied by numerous sections in black.and 
white through the coast ranges, and a colored geological map of the 

region extending from San Francisco to Los 
Angeles; also by a colored map and section 
of the region from the Rio Grande (then 
known as the Rio Bravo del Norte) to beyond 
Maricopa Wells (llL> 30'). 

Antisell was born in Ireland, of French 
Huguenot parentage, in 1817, and came to 
America for political rea- 
sketch of Antiseii. sons in 1848, where he prac- 
ticed medicine until 1854, 
though in the meantime holding the position 
of lecturer on chemistry in a number of col- 
leges, including those of Woodstock, Ver- 
mont; Pittsfield, Massachusetts; and at the 
Berkshire Medical Institute. Prior to his

fested a lively interest in matters pertaining to other sciences, and had 
published in 1 84b a duodecimo volume of 84 pages on Irish geology 
and a manual of agricultural chemistry, prepared with especial refer- 
ence to the soils of Ireland. His work with the Pacific Railroad Sur- 
vey, above noted, comprised his only geological investigations after 
coming to America. 

In 185b he was appointed an examiner in the Patent Office, but 
resigned to enter the Union Army as surgeon in 1861. In 1866 he 
became chief chemist of the Department of Agriculture, and in 1871 
was appointed by the Japanese Government an expert in chemical

Sierra Nevada terminated at Lassen's Butte, or that the Coast Moun- 
tains, when continued northward, form the Cascades of Oregon and 
Washington. He regarded Mount Shasta as a part of the Sierra 
Nevadas (as did also King, later), which were themselves probably of 
greater antiquity than the Coast Range Mountains. In this he was 
right. He thought to have discovered evidences of a continuous ice 
sheet in the region of the Three Sisters and Mount Jefferson in the 
Cascades. The canyons, as of the Columbia, he rightly regarded as 
due to stream erosion, not to rifts by volcanic action. The few fossils 
collected were described by Conrad and all as Miocene. 

The survey along the thirty-eighth and forty-first parallels was first 
placed under the direction of Captain Gunnison, who, however, lost his 
life in a tight with the Indians in Sevier Lake Valley in 1853. Lieut. 

E. H. Beckwith was then placed in charge, with Dr. 
schiei's work. James Schiel as geologist. The route lay across Kansas, 

up the Arkansas River, and across the front range to 
the valleys of the Grand and Green rivers, south of Salt Lake; thence 
across the Humboldt Desert and Sierra Nevadas to the Pitt and Sacra- 
mento rivers in California. The report contains scarcely anything of 
value from a geological standpoint, being mainly mineralogical and 
lithological, though a few invertebrate fossils are described and one

Fig. 62.— George Gibbs. 



George Gibbs accompanied a party under the command of Capt. 
George B. McClellan and made reports on the country lying on Shoal- 
water Ba} r and Puget Sound, and also in the central part of what was 

then the Territory of Wash- 
SnSCaSSi^"* ington. His published notes 
contained little of geological 
interest. Gibbs, it should be stated, while 
active in scientific matters, did little work 
along the broad lines of geology. His bib- 
liography consists, in addition to the above, 
of throe brief notes, altogether comprising 
less than a printed page. He thought to 
have discovered that the paving blocks — 
pebbles — on Waverly Place in New York 
City had through the weight of traffic yielded 
as if plastic, so that the concavity of one 
fitted into a corresponding convexity in its 
neighbor. He also called attention to the 
"glades' 1 in Oakland, Allegany County, Maryland, which he believed 
to have been the seats of ancient glaciers. 

In this connection mention should be made of the survey by Swallow 
of that portion of the line built under State auspices

the southwest and extending from St. Louis westward to the State 

Branch of the Pacific , 

Railroad in Missouri, line and known as the Southwest Branch. Ine report 
of this survey comprised, all told, less than one hundred 
pages, and is of interest mainly for the colored geological map of the 
region traversed. It dealt, naturally, mainly with economic questions, 
as the distribution of the ores of lead, zinc, 
and copper and the character of the soil. 

In 1854 the general assembly of Tennessee 
passed an act creating for a second time the 
office of geologist and mineralogist of the 
State. J. M. Safford, then holding the chair 
of chemistry, geology, and natural history 
in the Cumberland Univer- 
T^n r e s ; e e W r854 n sity at Lebanon, Tennessee, 
was appointed to the posi- 
tion, continuing to serve until the outbreak 
of the civil war, when the work was aban- 
doned. During this time he published two 
biennial reports, the first in 1856 compris- 
ing 164 pages, and the second in 1857 com- 
prising but 11 pages. A final volume on the geology of Tennessee, 
comprising 550 pages with 7 plates of fossils, appeared in 1869 (see 
p. 534).

The first report, known under the title of Geological Reconnaissance 
of Tennessee, was presented to the general assembly in 1855, and pub- 
lished in 1856. It was given up largely to a somewhat popular treatise 
on the economic geology of the State, with much interesting stratigraph- 
ical matter. 

He discussed the occurrence of the ores of iron, copper, lead, zinc, 
and even gold and silver, and included also a brief chapter on Alu- 
minum or the Metal from Clay. "Stone coal'" and the marbles 
received a share of attention, as well as various minor minerals. From 
a strictly geological standpoint the matter given in chapters 5 and 6 — 
the closing chapters of the report — was of greatest importance. Here 
he dwelt on the general geological structure of the State and gave the 
now well-known Cumberland section, reproduced with the original 
legend in tig. 61, and also an ideal cross section illustrating the geolog- 
ical structure of East Tennessee. He pointed out the striking paral- 
lelism of the valleys and ridges and the occasional vertical position of 
the beds, as well as the frequent repetition of the same series of beds, 
due to folding 1 and faulting.

He grouped the rocks under fourteen formations, extending from 
the mica-slate group of metamorphic rocks of Azoic age to the Allu- 
vial, post-Tertiary series. The much discussed and still enigmatical 
Ocoee conglomerates were included in his semimetamorphic series at 
the top of the Azoic. Troost, it will be remembered, put them at the 
base of his Cambrian. 

The importance of fossils for purposes of correlation was at this 
time distinctly recognized. 

Every formation has, in great part, its own species of fossils. Most of those found 
in one do not occur in any other. Upon this fact depends the great utility of fossils. 
They furnish, when known well enough to be recognized, unmistakable evidence of 
the geological position, and hence the general character of the formation in which 
they occur. 



458 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

This report shows on the part of Saft'ord a thorough insight into the 
intricacies of the structure of the State and an ability to grasp the 
salient features and master the broader problems in a manner perhaps 
not realized by many of his contemporaries and successors. 

• The second biennial report, which appeared in 1857, gave simply a 
brief account of the objects and utility of the survey, with a general 
summary of what had been accomplished. 

In this connection Richard O. Currey's Sketch of the Geology of the 
same State may be mentioned briefly. Currey bad been a pupil of 
Troost and later a professor of chemistry and geology in East Ten- 
nessee University. His geological writings are few

Journal or Medical and Physical Sciences, the Nash- 
ville Banner, and The Virginias. The sketches above referred to were 
first published in 1853 in the Nashville Banner, and subsequently 
brought out, under the title quoted, in form of a booklet of 128 pages, 
accompanied by a reprint of Safford's ma}) in black and white. 

In 1854 Dr. Ebenezer Emmons began the publication of a work on 
American Geology, the intention being, as announced in the "pro- 
posals," to bring it out in four or five parts, each of which should 

contain about 200 pages of matter. The first part, 
qZZIT, i854. erican containing 194 pages, was issued at Albany in 1854. 

It was given up mainly to a discussion of the general 
principles of geology, of the rocks composing the earth's crust, and 
some 70 pages devoted to An Application of Geological Facts and 
Principles to the Business of Mining. Part II — the last that was ever 
issued — comprised 250 pages and 18 plates, and was given up to an 
exposition of the author's views on the Taconic and Lower Silurian 
systems as developed in America and England. 

This work, as outlined, was by far the most pretentious of its kind 
that had thus far appeared in America, antedating Dana's Manual by 
some ten years, and having for its predecessors only the American 
reprints of Bakewell's Introduction, Buckland's Bridgewater Treatise, 
and De La Beche's Manual, besides the smaller text-books of Eaton 
and Emmons, published in the twenties, and which have been pre- 
viously noted. There was, therefore, ample room for a work of this 
nature, but it is doubtful if the occasion was propitious or Emmons 
the man for the task. Too much of the work (122 pages) was given 
up to a defense of the author's own peculiar views, which were not in 
all cases the best, or most generally accepted. His style was poor, 
often lacking in perspicuity, and in many ways he laid himself open to 
savage onslaughts of criticism." Unjust as much of this criticism may 
have been, Emmons, it must be confessed, showed singular ignorance 

"See Hall's review (unsigned) in the American Journal of Science, XIX, May, 1855. 



AMEEICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1850-1859. 459 

of, or indifference toward, much of the work that had been done in the 
West and Northwest, and his ideas regarding the early history of the 
globe were not the most advanced. Heat was regarded as at first 
the predominant and active element. As the activity of fire dimin- 
ished, that of the antagonistic element, water, increased. The first 
was paroxysmal in its action, the latter constant. In America he 
found the evidences of aqueous agencies on a grand scale, but "vol- 
canic lire'' 1 seemed so far a thing of the past that it was " impossible 
to obtain specimens even for laboratory illustration." 

Fire or heat, he wrote, acts in four ways: (1) In the elevation of 
areas by expansive forces beneath the crust; (2) by the transference 
of fused matter from the interior to the surface; (3) by producing 
areas of subsidence, caused by this loss of matter from beneath; and 
(4) the elevation or depression of areas simply through expansion and 
contraction of strata by heat and cold. The internal heat he regarded 
as effective in sustaining "that degree of temperature which is best 
fitted to the organic and structural conditions of living beings" on the 
earth. 

The classification adopted was essentially the same as that put out 
in his North Carolina report (p. 431) and need not be repeated here. 

The pyrocrystalline rocks, it may be stated, however, he regarded 
as the results of the primary consolidation of the earth's crust. The 
fact that some of these occurred in dikes he thought to be due to the 
Assuring of the earlier-cooled portions of the crust by shrinkage and 
the forcing up through these fissures of the lower, still unconsolidated 
portion. He imagined that the age of rocks might be deduced from 
their crystalline state, the older having been subjected to greater heat 
and hence becoming most perfectl} T fused and most highly crystalline 
on cooling. The granites were, therefore, regarded as the first prod- 
ucts of cooling and the oldest of rocks. 

Emmons regarded concretions and nodules as S3 7 mmetrical bodies 
due to "a force by virtue of which the molecules are really transferred 
to central points where, by constant accumulation,' 1 the}^ form the 
concretion. The parallel planes of the rhombic forms in limestones 
and slaty rocks, and jointed structure in general, "admits of the same 
explanation." The concentric weathering shown b} T massive rocks 
was referred to the same cause. Further than this, he regarded the 
phenomena of rift and grain in a massive rock as identical with cleav- 
age in a simple mineral. Such rocks "are not only composed of 
crystallized minerals, but they are crystalline in the mass." 

The serpentine of Syracuse, New York, he considered a magnesian 
i/ock altered b} r proximity to eruptives, and he still adhered to the idea 
of the igneous origin of the crystalline limestones of St. Lawrence 
County, as announced in his New York report. For the first time in 
an American text-book there was here recognized the relationship

existing 1 between conglomerates and sandstones as shore deposits and 
the pelagic, calcareous, and argillaceous materials laid down at greater 
depths. 

In 1854 Dr. William Kitchell was appointed superintendent of the 

geological survey of New Jersey. He continued in office until the close 

of 1856, during which time he made three annual reports, being 

assisted in the geological work by George H. Cook 

Kitchell's Geological . & ; ~. J T - ft 

survey of New and in the topographic by Egbert L. Viele. It was 

expected that Conrad would take charge of the pale- 
ontological work, but failing health forcing him to resign, it was placed 
in the hands of James Hall. Up to the time of the discontinuance of 
the survey, however, Hall appears to have done little. The vertebrate 
fossils collected were placed in the hands of Joseph Leidy. Mr. Henry 
Wurtz served as chemist and mineralogist. 

Such part of the work as was done directly by Kitchell contained 
little that was original or worthy of note, the stratigraphic work being 
almost wholly done by Professor Cook. In the first report considera- 
ble attention was paid to the greenstone marls, their distribution and 
chemical composition, although other economic questions were taken 
up, particularly those relating to the iron ores. The magnetic iron 
ores were regarded as deposited contemporaneously with the sedi- 
mentary rocks in which they were inclosed. 

In the third annual report, printed in 1856, Cook called attention to 
the swamp lands and buried timber, and also the apparent gradual 
encroachments of the sea in Cape May Count} 7 , and stated it as his 
opinion that the sinking of the coast was going on at the rate of about 
2 feet in one hundred years. The white crystalline limestone of the 
highlands was here classed as Azoic. 

The results of these observations were afterwards printed with some 
additional matter in separate form, entitled Geology of the County of 
Cape May, State of New Jersey, bearing the date of 1857. This report 
contained a colored geological map of the county and catalogues of 
the zoological and botanical collections and a few fossil invertebrates. 

The survey was brought to a close on the 1st of May, 1856, owing 
to the fact that the State did not feel able to provide an appropriation 
for its continuance." 

The surveying party under Maj. W. H. Emory, for the purpose of 

fixing the Mexican boundary in accordance with the treaty of 1851, 

was accompanied by Dr. C. C. Parry in the capacity of geologist and 

botanist and Arthur Schott as an assistant. The obser-

graphical and nuneralogical, with numerous notes of a 
lithological nature. Collections of fossils were fortunately made, 

"According to Cook (Geology of New Jersey, 1868), Kitchell died suddenly in the 
midst of his active duties, leaving his notes and papers unarranged for publication.

which were referred to Messrs. Hall and Conrad for determination and 
report. The published report, the work of all the above mentioned, 
comprised but 174 pages of text, with 21 plates of fossils. It was, 
however, noteworthy in containing a colored geological map of the 
Mississippi Valley and country to the west. This has the distinction 
of being the earliest colored geological map of the region published by 
the Government. It is, moreover, of historical interest as showing 
how little was definitely known of the region. The known mountain 
ranges were colored as metamorphic, often flanked by more or less 
sinuous, narrow bands of Cretaceous and Carboniferous rocks. Large 
areas of igneous- rocks were represented as occurring in the extreme 
northwest (California, Oregon, and Washington), but the great inte- 
rior, the Great Basin region, was left almost entirely blank — geolog- 
ically a terra incognita. 

The fossils, collected largely from Texas, were almost wholly Ter- 
tiary, Cretaceous, and Upper Carboniferous forms. A few Lower 
Silurian forms were figured and named b} T Hall, but no descriptions 
were given. 

What should have been the most important work on economic 
geology of the year, and perhaps the most important thus far to 
appear, with the exception of Whitney's Metallic Wealth of the United 

States, already noted, was Lesley's Manual of Coal 
coai? y i856. anua, ° f aQ d ^s Topography, issued in 1856 — an octavo volume 

of 224 pages. The scope of the volume was, however, 
scarcely what one would be led to expect from its title, and its possible 
usefulness sadly marred by the personal claims of the author. Not 
confining himself to the subject of coal and its topography, he entered 
freely into the subject of mountain structure, with especial reference 
to the Appalachians, the formation of \ alleys, theories of the drift, 
topographical drawing, and kindred subjects. Lesley was, it should 
be remembered, a topographical assistant on the survey under Rogers 
in 1839-1851. Reference to his work while on the survey is there- 
fore to be expected, though it must be confessed one's expectations 
are somewhat exceeded when he lays claim, on his own behalf and 
that of Messrs. Whelpley and Henderson — also assistants on the 
Rogers survey — to having been the first to unravel the intricacies of 
Appalachian structure. " Years of patient toil," he writes, " it cost 
us to unfold the mysteries of the Pennsylvania and Virginia range." 
This same claim, in an even more aggressive form, he put forward 
again three years later, in his Iron Manufacturer's Guide, which 
appeared under the authority of the American Iron Association, of 
which he was secretary, in 1859. a 

"These attacks brought forth an emphatic rejoinder from R. E. Rogers (a brother 
of H. D. Rogers), which was printed privately in form of a pamphlet of 22 pages, 
1859. 



462 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

The merits of the case can not here be decided, but it would seem 
most probable that this otters but another illustration of the experi- 
ences of every executive who has planned, directed, and rendered 
possible the work of subordinates, only to find in the end that the 
value of his instrumentality is quite underestimated, and all credit 
claimed by him to whom opportunit} r was given. 

In 1856 Dr. Edward Hitchcock came once more to the front through 
the medium of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge with a 
paper of some 150 royal quarto pages and 12 plates. In this he con- 
sidered all changes which had taken place since the 
Hitchcock's close of the Tertiary period as belonging to the "allu- 

Illustrations of ,. ,: , ' .,, . 

surface Geology, vial formation, an d d ue to causes still m operation. 
The products of these changes he classed as (1) drift 
unmodified and (2) drift modified, under the latter including such 
deposits as beaches, ancient and modern; submarine ridges; sea bot- 
toms; osars; dunes; terraces; deltas, and moraines. The drift proper 
he regarded as a product of "several agencies — icebergs, glaciers, 
landslips, and waves of translation" — which, though more active in 
the past than now, are still at work. The sandy and gravelly plains 
(the overwash of modern geologists) and the low ridges of New Eng- 
land were thought to represent old sea bottoms, to be ""explained only 
by the former presence of the ocean above them, with its tides and 
currents." 

The terraces of the Connecticut River were described in great detail, 
with numerous references to those of other regions, both at home and 
abroad. The chief agency in the formation of these appeared to him, 
and rightly, to have been water. Moraine terraces, however, demanded 
the action of stranded icebergs in addition. To account for the drift 
accumulations at various altitudes, he conceived that the ocean water 
. must have stood some 2,500 feet above its present level. He conceived 
further "that all the northern part of this continent, at least all east 
of the Mississippi, had been covered b}^ the ocean since the glacial 
period," in this agreeing with Agassiz. As to the origin of the mate- 
rial of the "irregular coarse deposit beneath the modified beaches and 
terraces," he agreed essentially with the German geologist, Naumann, 
in supposing that: (1) The eroding materials must have been commi- 
nuted stone; (2) they must have been borne along under heavy pres- 
sure; (3) the moving force must have operated slowly and with 
prodigious energy, and (1) moving in a nearly uniform direction, 
though liable to local divergence; (5) the vehicle of the eroded mate- 
rial could not have been water alone, (6) but a firm and heavy mass, 
somewhat plastic. "Where, now, save in glaciers, icebergs, and ice 
islands can we find agencies that meet the conditions of the above 
principles respecting drift?" The exact period of operation of the 
drift agency naturally he found difficulty in determining. He felt

that while the greater part of the work was accomplished before the 
continent hud emerged very considerably from the water, nevertheless 
the work of erosion went on for some time after emergence began. 

In his discussion relative to traces of ancient glaciers he called atten- 
tion to the occurrence of two series of stritv. differing- in their direc- 
tion, the more extensive being what he termed " drift stria'," and the 
second, much more limited in extent, "glacial strise," the latter being 
confined to the valleys. The first he thought due to aqueo-glacial 
causes; the last to glaciers existing earlier than the drift. Further 
investigation brought to light other stria 1 which seemed quite as recent 
as any caused by the drift agency, and he confessed to a feeling of 
doubt as to which of the agencies was earliest. " Perhaps there were 
two periods of glaciers, one before and one subsequent to the drift. 

The facts concerning the dispersion of bowlders he thought could be 
more satisfactorily explained by icebergs than by glaciers, since this 
transportation and scattering continued till after the time when a large 
part of the beaches and terraces were formed. Glaciers would have 
plowed tracks through stratified deposits. Icebergs such as now 
traverse the Atlantic might carry bowlders over the beaches and ter- 
races and drop them from time to time, forming thus the intermixture 
of coarse, angular blocks and beach or terrace material as we now find 
it. "The supposition that a glacier once existed on this continent, 
wide enough to reach from Newfoundland to the Rocky Mountains, is 
the grand difficulty in the way of the glacial theory." (See further 
on p. -171.) 

The illustrations accompanying this paper were beautifully exe- 
cuted, perhaps the best, both those in color and in black and white, 
that had thus far been produced. 

A second work of Hitchcock, published this same year and needing 
a brief reference, was his Geology of the Globe, a small octavo volume 
of 136 pages, 6 plates of fossils, and 2 colored geological maps, one 
of the United States and Canada and one of the world. 

The source of inspiration was evidently Boue's treatise published 
under the auspices of the Geological Societ} r of France. On the maps 
the various formations, indicated by color, were: (1) Hypozoic and 
metamorphic strata, with granite, syenite, and some porphyries; (2) 
Primary fossiliferous strata to the top of the Carboniferous; (3) Sec- 
ondary strata; (4) Tertiary strata; (5) Alluvial deposits; and (6) Vol- 
canoes and igneous rocks of the Alluvial and Tertiary periods. 
Comparatively few areas are left uncolored — areas scarcely larger than 
those left as unknown or uncertain on the map published in 1884 by 
the official survey of the United States. When one thinks of this he 
can but smile at the naive remark of the author when referring to the 
coloring: "Nor can I doubt that it is done approximately correct."

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1V>04. 



Such a work was necessarily largely a compilation and contained 
little original matter. 

J. D. Dana, in an article On the Plan of Development in the Geo- 
logical History of North America, called attention to the fact that the 
greater mountain ranges border on the greater oceans in both Ameri- 
cas, also to the apparent fact that volcanic activity, or

est along the coasts bordering on the greater oceans. 

Assuming that the typical form of a continent is a basin with bor- 
ders of mountains facing the oceans, and the heights of the mountains 
and volcanic activity are proportional to the size of the oceans, and 
again that volcanoes characterize oceanic islands and not continental 
interiors, he showed that the extent and position of oceanic depres- 
sions have in a great degree determined the features of the land; that 
oceanic depression and continental elevation have both 
been in progress with mutual reaction from the begin- 
ning of the earth's refrigeration. The original V-shaped 
character of the North American continent he showed 
to be due to the forces acting from the two oceans. 

" ( Ymtraction was the power, under Divine Direction, 
which led to the oscillations of the crust, the varied suc- 
cessions in the strata."'' These views, it will be observed, 
are largely in accordance with those advanced in his 
Wilkes Exploring Expedition report in 1849. 
Prior to 1856 the age of the slates of Braintree, Mas- 
sachusetts, had been problematical. By 
most of the geologists of the time they 
had been considered as Primary or, pos- 
sibly, Transitional. A distinct advance was, therefore, 
marked when, at the August, 1856, meeting of the 
Boston Society of Natural History, Prof. W. B. Rogers 
announced the finding in these slates of trilobites, later identified as 
belonging to Barrande's Paradoxides and perhaps identical with 
Green's Paradoxides harlcmi, which had been described from a speci- 
men, source unknown, in the cabinet of Mr. Francis Alger. On 
presentation of this evidence Rogers felt justified in referring the 
Braintree slates to the horizon of the lowest Paleozoic group, or 
about the level of the Primal rocks, the Potsdam sandstone, and the 
Protozoic sandstone of Owen. The beds, it may be noted, are, in the 
latest edition of Dana's Manual (1894), referred to the Middle Cam- 
brian, and, therefore, lie below r the Potsdam. 

With the exception of the papers by Dana and Couthouy, scarcely 
anything of consequence on the subject of corals, geologically consid- 
ered, had thus far appeared from the pen of an American. At the 
meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science,

argued that the peninsula of Florida owed its southern 
continuation to a double process of coral-reef growth and sedimenta- 
tion from the Gulf Stream. It was his idea that the sediments brought 
down by the Mississippi sank to a depth beyond observation before 
reaching the Keys, but were gradually deposited along the inner side 
of the curve formed by the current as it passed around the point. 
When the bottom should have become sufficiently elevated by this 
process, a new reef would begin to form. This process he thought to 
have gone on until the channel had become narrowed as now, and the 
rush of water, together with the depth, practically precluded further 
deposition. Waves throwing broken material upon the beaches would 
serve to till the old channels and convert them into dry land. In brief, 
"the peninsula and Keys of Florida have been the result of the com- 
bined action of at least three agencies. First, the Gulf Stream laid 
the foundation; upon that corals built up to the water level; and, 
finally, the work was completed by the waves." 

Le Conte further conceived that the rate of flow of the Gulf Stream 
has been gradually accelerated by the narrowing of its channel, and 
hence had made itself manifest at a greater distance into the Atlantic, 
thus bringing about a gradual amelioration of the climate of England. 

In 1855 the first State geological survey of Iowa was organized, and 

Dr. James Hall made State geologist. The organization continued 

through 1858. The reports of the survey appeared in the form of 

two octavo volumes, of which the second volume was 

Hall's Geological . in i i tt n • x i 

Survey of iowa, given up wholly to paleontology. Hall was assisted 
in this survey by J. D. Whitney, who served as 
chemist and mineralogist, and by A. H. Worthen, F. B. Meek, and 
R. P. Whitfield. 

Hall noted the rapid westward thinning out of the various beds of 
sedimentary rocks, including those of the Hudson River, Medina, 
Clinton, Niagara, and Onondaga salt group, and Catskill Mountain 
group, and made the following comment: 

This remarkable fact of the thinning out westerly of all the sedimentary forma- 
tions points to a cause in the conditions of the ancient ocean, and the currents which 
transported the great mass of material along certain lines, which became the lines 
of greatest accumulation of sediments, and consequently present the greatest thick- 
ness of strata at the present time. It is this great thickness of strata, whether dis- 
turbed and inclined as in the Green and White mountains and the Appalachians 
generally, or lying horizontally as in the Catskill Mountains, that gives the strung 
features to the hilly and mountainous country of the East and which gradually dies 
out as we go westward just in proportion as the strata become attenuated.

Again, with reference to the subdued features of the West, he 
wrote: 

The thickness of the entire series of sedimentary rocks, no matter how much dis- 
turbed and denuded, is not here great enough to produce mountain features. 

In this, it will be observed, is given the gist of his theory of moun- 
tain formation, as announced two years later. 

Numerous changes in nomenclature and important correlations were 
made, or at least attempted. The Lower Magnesian limestone of 
Owen he considered as identical with the Calciferous of New York, 
and gave the name Galena to the limestone immediately succeeding 
the Trenton, and which Owen had called Upper Magnesian. The 
"Coralline and Upper Pentamerus beds of the Upper Magnesian 
limestone," of Owen, he identified as Niagara, and proposed the name 
Leclaire to designate a gray to whitish limestone lying next above the 
Niagara and found outcropping near the town of that name. The 
entire series of Coal Measure rocks he showed to have been deposited 
after the disturbances producing the low folds in the Silurian rocks, 
illustrating their relative position by the section here reproduced. 

The encrinital group of Burlington and that of Hannibal, Missouri, 
thought by D. D. Owen to be distinct, were considered by Hall to be 
identical. The entire series of Carboniferous limestones were regarded 
as " successively deposited in an ocean, the limits of which were grad- 
ually contracted upon the north while at the south the conditions were 
becoming more and more favorable to the development of this kind of 
deposition and to the support of the fauna which abounded throughout 
the period, until both culminated in the great limestone formation of 
Kaskaskia. (The Archimedes limestone of Owen.) 

In discussing the relationship of the limestone and coal, Hall quoted 
from his report on the geology and paleontology of the Mexican 
Boundary, elsewhere alluded to. With reference to this he wrote: 

The conditions favorable to the production of an extensive deposit of marine lime- 
stone are not such as usually accompany the production of coal. In the present 
instance the ocean, depositing the great limestone formations previous to the coal 
period, occupied to a great extent the present area of the Coal Measures which suc- 
ceeded in the valley of the Mississippi. * * * We begin thus to comprehend the 
truth, that during the period of the great coal formations of the West, in which these 
calcareous deposits were in course of formation — that during the oscillations which 
we know to have occurred throughout the coal period there was a time when the 
whole area became depressed so as to allow the waters of the western ocean to 
tl<»\v over all the Coal Measure region; or, at least, as far northward and eastward 
as the northeastern part of Ohio, and from hence it derived the limestone under 
consideration. 

The series of beds immediately underlying the Carboniferous rocks 
at Burlington, and now considered as Kinderhook (sub-Carboniferous), 
Hall relegated to the Chemung; this proved to be an error, and one 
that it required many years to eradicate. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1850-1859. 467 

It was noted that the Potsdam sandstone seemed likely to be found 
strongly developed in the Rocky Mountain region. 

Subsequent to this period, however, every sedimentary formation indicates the 
proximity of land on the east. The great thickness of strata, coarse materials, and 
numerous fucoids of the Hudson River group in its eastern extension indicate prox- 
imity to land, or the course of strong currents, while in the west the formation dies 
out in some inconspicuous fine shaly and calcareous beds, which, both in nature and 
condition of the material and in the fossil contents, indicate great distance from land 
and a quiet ocean." 

Hall took the ground that the treeless character of the prairies was 
due mainly to the character of the soil, and inferred, on what seemed 

«The volumes of this work now in the library of the National Museum were the 
personal property of F. B. Meek, and many of the statements made by Hall are sav- 
agely criticised by the former in marginal notes. Thus, with reference to Hall's 
statements as to the Potsdam, Meek notes: "It was quite safe for him to make this 
prediction, when he knew at the time he was writing it, I had identified Potsdam 
fossils in Hayden's collections from the Black Hills. These fossils were then in Pro- 
fessor Hall's house — he had seen them and heard me say I regarded them as Potsdam 
species." 

Still jealous of his diseovei'ies of supposed Permian fossils in the West, Meek also 
bitterly criticised Hall's reference to the occurrence of Permian and Jurassic rocks in 
the Rocky Mountain region, and added in the margin: "This was all intended to 
bear the date of 1857, although every word of it was written after the publication of 
our (i. e., Meek and Hayden) Permian and Jurassic discoveries in 1858." 

Again on page 142, Hall stated: "In the early part of 1857 Mr. Worthen placed 
in the hands of the writer some peculiar fossils collected several years since in 
Illinois and supposed to be from the Coal Measures. These, however, were at once 
recognized as of peculiar forms, differing from Coal-Measure fossils, and a farther 
examination proves them to be of Permian types, and closely allied to British 
species." To this statement Meek has added the following marginal note: "At the 
time he obtained these fossils from Mr. W. he told Mr. W. he regarded them as 
lower Cretaceous forms." Also "If he had stated when this 'later' examination 
was made, it would have been all right; but he leaves it to be inferred that it was 
sometime in 1857, when, in fact, it was not until after the publication of our paper 
on the Kansas fossils on the 2nd of March, 1858; and yet he intended at that time 
that this report should bear the date of 1857." 

On page 144 Hall suggested the probability of finding in the West beds of the age of 
the Jura or Oolite of Europe. To this Meek has added the following: "How wonder- 
fully sagacious he was to make this prediction, when he knew we had Jurassic fossils 
then in his house (which he had seen) from the Black Hills, Nebraska! Yet what 
is here written is intended to date in 1857." 

Again, Hall says: "Thus far the collections made in the explorations across this 
western country have brought us no true Jurassic fossils, ami it is only in the far 
north and upon the Pacific coast, as well also as in the southern extremity of the 
continent, that we have the evidences of the existence of these rocks below the Cre- 
taceous formation." To which Meek appended the following: "At the very time 
when Professor Hall wrote those words some of Doctor Hayden's Jurassic fossils from 
the Black Hills were lying in a tray within fifteen feet of him, in an adjoining room. 
I had called his attention to them and told him I was satisfied they must be Jurassic 
forms." 

It is the old story of jealousy and heartburning (warranted in this case, it may be) 
which seems an almost invariable outcome of any attempt at mutual collaboration. 



46 cS REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

to him to be reasonable grounds, that the soil itself originated in form 
of an almost impalpable sediment, which gradually accumulated on 
the bottom of an immense lake which once occupied the region. 

Hall, as already noted, was assisted in his work on the geological 
•survey of Iowa by J. D. Whitney, who served as chemist and miner- 
alogist. A good deal of attention was given by Whitney to the chem- 
ical nature of the coals and the distribution and mode 
i^wa ,T8S8 Work '" °f occurrence of the lead and zinc ores. There was, 
however, very little of a theoretical nature, and specu- 
lations regarding the origin of the ores were almost entirely lacking. 
He regarded the iron ore of Jackson as having originated, in some 
instances at least, through the decomposition of nodules of iron pyrites 
which are distributed irregularly through the rock. In other cases he 
thought it to be a deposit from springs, the original material, how- 
ever, having been derived from the decomposition of pyrite, as before. 

Considerable attention was naturally given to the lead and zinc ores. 
He noted that where the Galena limestone had a maximum thickness, 
the lead deposits were limited to the central and lower portions of the 
rock, and never penetrated the Blue limestone, and he had satisfied 
himself that, in a great majority of cases at least, the deposits diminished 
in productiveness rapidly after passing below a limit perhaps fifty 
feet above the base of the Galena. When, however, the Galena lime- 
stone was diminished in thickness, he noted that the lead deposits were 
found in lower and lower positions until, at last, the bottom of the 
Blue limestone was reached, where the Upper sandstone entirely cut 
oil' the ore, there having never been a single instance, so far as he had 
ascertained, in which a crevice had been worked in that rock. 

He found reason, therefore, to differ somewhat with Owen in his 
statement to the effect that when a mine was sunk through the Cliff 
to the Blue limestone beneath, the lodes shrank to insignificance, as 
considerable deposits of ore had been worked in the Blue limestone, 
though by far the larger portion of the lead of the upper mines came 
from the lead-bearing rock. 

As to the possibility of the lead-bearing crevices extending down- 
ward indefinitely and the probability of deep mining ever being likely 
to prove profitable, Whitne}^ wrote, "The question can be answered 
unhesitatingly in the negative, 1 ' and went on to state that the most 
profitable method of mining will be in the form of horizontal excava- 
tions or drifts and not by means of vertical shafts. 

The Iowa lead deposits, it should be noted, he regarded as occurring 
in gash veins. The mineral deposits of the Northwest in general were 
classified under the heads of surface deposits, vertical crevices, and flat 
sheets, as in his work on the metallic wealth of the United States 
(p. 438). 

Perhaps the most peculiar idea advanced b}^ Whitney in any part 
of his report is that regarding the origin of the siliceous matter of the 
Potsdam sandstone. 



AMETCIOAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1850-1859. 4()9 

It has been generally assumed that such sandstones were originally formed by 
mechanical agencies, the material being supposed to have gradually accumulated 
from the grinding down of previously existing quartzose rocks. The facts collected, 
however, seem rather to point to chemical than mechanical causes. * * * AVe 
can hardly understand how such an amount of quartzose sand could have been accu- 
mulated without its containing at the same time a considerable quantity of detritus, 
which could be recognized as having come from the destruction of the schistose, 
feldspath, and trappean rocks, which make up the larger portion of the Azoic series 
wherever it has been examined. The uniform size of the grains of which the sand- 
stone is composed and the tendency to the development of crystalline facets in them 
are additional facts winch suggest the idea of chemical precipitation rather than of 
mechanical accumulation. « 

In 1850 Prof. Edward Hitchcock was appointed State geologist of 
Vermont, and continued to serve until 1860, at which time he submitted 
his final report, which appeared in 1861 in the form of two quarto vol- 
umes of 982 pages, accompanied by a colored geolog-- 

Hitchcock's . ■ , . fc& 

Geology of Vermont, ical map of. the State, two maps showing the terraces 
and beaches, and 35 plates ol scenery, fossils, sections, 
etc. Hiteheoek was assisted in the work by his sons, Edward Hitch- 
eock, jr., and C. H. Hitchcock, and by Albert D.. Hager, in whose 
charge was placed the final publication of the work. 

The main objects of the survey, as outlined in the introduction, were 
first, to gain such a knowledge of the solid rocks of the State as to be 
able to delineate them upon maps and sections; second, to study the 
loose deposits lying upon the solid rocks and trace "out the changes 
which the surface of the State had undergone; third, to collect, arrange, 
and name specimens of rocks, minerals, and fossils from every part of 
the State for the State cabinet; fourth, to obtain a full collection, for 
the same cabinet, of specimens valuable from an economic standpoint; 
and fifth, to identify the metamorphosed rocks of the State with those 
which had not been thus changed. 

The systematic geology was in immediate charge of Professor 
Hitchcock, though aided by C. B. Adams, Zadock Thompson, A. P. 
Hager, and C. H. Hitchcock. The economic geology was in charge 
of Hager, and the chemistry, of C. H. Hitchcock. The Rev. S. K. 
Hall aided in the preparation of a report on the northern part of the 
State and its agricultural possibilities. The paleontological work was 
done by James Hall, and the paleobotanical by Lesquereux. Hitch- 
cock recognized at this date that each rock formation was character- 
ized by its peculiar group of fossils not found in any other; so that a 
paleontologist, on seeing a specimen, could usualty tell from which of 

«The explanation of this error lies in the fact that the grains of which this sand- 
stone is made up have been cemented by a secondary deposition of interstitial 
silica, so deposited as to convert each granule into a more or less perfect crystal, of 
which the original sand grain forms the nucleus. It is a case of secondary growth 
and enlargement, a phenomenon now well known to every petrographer, but 
undreamed of at the time of Whitney's writing. 



470 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

the series it caine, thus indicating a great advance over any of his pre- 
vious reports. 

His views on metamorphism and the production of schistose and 
slaty cleavage were still, however, in an immature state.' It is to be 
noted, however, that all through his work he is far from being- dog- 
matic, usually contenting himself with a discussion of, and full quota- 
tions from, the expressed opinions of others, stating his reasons for 
adopting or rejecting any one, as the case ma}^ have been. 

Referring to the agencies of metamorphism, and particularly the 
chemical changes involved in the "transfer of ingredients from one 
part of a mass to another," he wrote: "We know of no other agency 
by which this could be produced, except by galvanism." To the same 
agency he would ascribe the production of cleavage, foliation, and 
joints. He nevertheless recognized the possibility of the metamor- 
phism of sediments through pressure, and dwelt in considerable detail 
upon the elongation and flattening of pebbles in the conglomerates 
near Newport, Rhode Island. The jointing of rocks in these conglom- 
erates he regarded, as already stated, as due "to some polar force such 
as heat or galvanism. Mere shrinkage could not have separated the 
pebbles so smoothly, much less could a strain from beneath have thus 
fractured them. * * * A mere inspection of the rock in place will 
satisfy anyone that no mechanical agency is sufficient to explain these 
phenomena." Yet to-day "mere inspection"''' will satisfy anyone that 
mechanical agency is amply sufficient. (See also p. 510.) 

He regarded feldspar in all of the crystalline rocks as the result of 
a process of metamorphism: 

Silicates probably furnished the ingredients, which, being abstracted by hot water, 
left the excess of silica in the form of quartz, and formed the feldspar and mica to 
fill up the interstices. The feldspar, which has converted the cement into gneiss, 
could have no other origin, and this fact, in connection with all the rest which have 
been adduced, forces a presumption that feldspar in nearly all the crystalline rocks, 
stratified and unstratified, is a product of metamorphism. 

Further on, he wrote: 

Metamorphism furnishes the most plausible theory of the origin of the Azoic 
stratified rocks, which are mica, talc, and hornblende schists, gneiss, serpentine, 
white limestone, etc., such as cover a large part of Vermont. 

He recognized at this time the influence of water as an essential 
constituent of the trappean rocks, since the intrusion of the material, 
often in thin sheets scarcely thicker than writing paper, could not be 
explained on the theory of fusion from dry heat alone. " By means 
of water the materials could be introduced wherever that substance 
could penetrate." 

His ideas concerning the origin of the drift had been considerably 
modi tied since his earlier reports, though he was not as yet willing to 
accept the theory of a continental ice sheet. Thus: 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY — DECADE OF 1850-1859. 47 1 

We have no doubt that a part of what we call drift phenomena in New England 
was produced by glaciers such as we have described as once connected with the 
Green Mountain range. But the main features of drift we impute to icebergs and 
ice floes as the continent was gradually sinking beneath the ocean. 

He thought, too, to have found evidence that the continent went 
down to a depth of .something like 2,000 feet, and as some of the ice- 
bergs in the Atlantic have been estimated as extending 2,500 feet 
below the surface, he argued that the effects of such could not be dis- 
tinguished from those of glaciers. Indeed, the idea of a continental 
ice sheet was still beyond his comprehension, and his chief arguments 
against the glacial origin of much of the drift was based upon the fact 
that all known glaciers are confined to valleys; and, moreover, that 
there was no known glacier more than 50 or 60 miles wide, "whereas 
the ancient American glacier must have been at least 2,500 miles wide 
and have spread over all the mountains as well as valle} T s, and often 
have been obliged to move uphill as well as over a level surface/' 
The three prominent directions of the drift were to him also arguments 
against the ice sheet. These were essentially the ideas advanced in 
his Surface Geology (p. 402). 

On lithological grounds the alluvial deposits were classified as (1) 
drift and (2) modified drift, and on chronological grounds into four 
periods, in each of which the continent was differently situated in 
respect to the level of the ocean. These were, first, the drift period, 
when the continent was under water at its greatest depth; second, the 
beach period, when it began to emerge; third, the terrace period, 
when the continent rose to nearly its present situation; and, fourth, 
the historic or present period. The phenomena of the modified drift 
as terraces and beaches were worked out in detail in this report by 
C. H. Hitchcock. 

In the chapter on hypozoic and paleozoic rocks Hitchcock expressed 
the belief that the rocks of Vermont have been thrown into a succes- 
sion of folds while in a semiplastic condition by a force from the 
direction of the Atlantic, and that their crests have been subsequently 
denuded, some 10,000 vertical feet having, it was estimated, disap- 
peared from the surface of the Shelburne anticline. The strata of 
those folds with westerly dips, on the western side of the anticlines, 
he regarded as occupying a normal position; while those with easterly 
dips, on the eastern side, had been inverted, so that, as he expressed 
it, "though we cross an uninterrupted succession of easterly dips in 
going eastward we can not infer that we are constantly meeting with 
older and older rocks, and therefore that mere superposition would 
not justify one in deciding upon their relative ages." 

Concerning the position of the much-disputed red-sand rock, Hitch- 
cock remarked that without an exception it rested upon the Hudson 
River group, and the stratigraphical evidence showed it to be of the 



472 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

age of the Medina sandstone or Oneida conglomerate. In this he was 
in error, the red-sand rock being now universally conceded as belong- 
ing to the Lower Cambrian. He also regarded the black slate beneath 
the red-sand rock as belonging to the Hudson River group, although 
Emmons had regarded it as Taconic and thought to recognize a Pots- 
dam sandstone in the vicinity of Whitehall, in this respect antagoniz- 
ing the views of Adams, as announced in his second report. 

The name ^Eolian limestone was given to the marble beds of Dorset 
Mountain, which had been renamed Mount JEolius. Its exact geolog- 
ical position was not determined, although it was thought that it might 
be as new as the Carboniferous. 

Hitchcock was inclined to side with Emmons in the Taconic contro- 
versy, on the ground that the rocks were physically unlike the Lower 
Silurian which they underlay and differed in the character of their 
organic remains. The thickness of these Taconic rocks he estimated 
to be not less than 25,000 feet. N 

The clay slate directly overlying the calciferous mica schist was 
thought to be probably of Devonian age. The calciferous mica schist 
itself was regarded as having been originally a limestone formation 
charged with a good deal of silex and with perhaps silicates and 
organic matter, a great deal of the carbonate of lime having been 
abstracted by carbonated water and the rock converted by metamor- 
phism into a schist. 

The numerous beds of serpentine which were found in the State 
limits were regarded as having been derived mainly from beds of horn- 
blende schist and diorite. Much of the granite of the State was con- 
sidered as being as recent, at least, as the Devonian period. 

It seems almost extraordinary that, even at this date, there were 
believed by Hitchcock, as well as by others, to be many well-authen- 
ticated instances on record in which toads, snakes, and lizards had been 
found alive in the solid parts of living trees and in solid rocks, as well 
as in gravel deep beneath the surface. In these cases it was assumed 
that the animals " undoubtedly crept into such places while young, 
and, after having grown, could not get out. Being very tenacious of 
life and probably obtaining some nourishment occasionally by seizing 
upon insects that might crawl into their nidus, they might sometimes 
continue alive even after many years." 

Under date of March, 1857, an act of the Wisconsin legislature 
provided for a geological and agricultural survey of the State, which 
was to be under the joint control of James Hall, Ezra S. Carr, and 
Geological Surveys Edward Daniels. This joint leadership seemed, how- 
Hair i c C a°r" s 'and nder evei \ t° have proven unsatisfactory, and by a second 
Daniels, 1857. ac ^ approved April 2, 1860, James Hall was appointed 

principal to the commission. This last organization proved also to be 
short-lived, the survey being discontinued in 1862, the legislature 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY— DECADE OF 1850-1859. 473 

even going - so far as to refuse to refund to Hall the money actually 
expended by him for the purpose of the survey or to pay for his own 
services. Under HalFs brief administration Whitney, who had served 
in a like capacity in Iowa, was employed to complete the work on the 
lead region and Charles Whittlesey to study the regions lying on 
the west side of the Menomonee River and the iron region of Lake 
Superior. 

A single royal octavo volume of 455 pages and 9 plates, a colored 
geological map of the lead region, and a diagram showing the position 
of the ore crevices, appeared in 1862 as a result of this organization. 

In this Hall repeated his attempts at correlation of the western with 
the eastern formations. In addition he called attention to the driftless 
area of the State, and to the fact that, over the whole area south of the 
Wisconsin River, the Galena limestone and a portion of the underlying 
Blue limestone had been removed by decomposition and solution to a 
depth of some 350 to 400 vertical feet. 

Whitney, in his report on the lead-bearing region showed, as in his 
previous work (p. 46S), that the lead-bearing fissures of the Northwest 
were limited to one set of strata, and that there are but rarely any 
evidences of dislocation of the strata or faults. Hence, he was forced 
to the conclusion that the ore-bearing crevices originated through the 
action of some local cause or forces which were limited in their field 
of action to a comparatively narrow vertical range. In short, he con- 
ceived the lead-bearing fissures to have been originally closely allied 
to wdiat are called joints. How far shrinkage and crystalline action 
may have been concerned in the production of these joints, he was 
unable to say, but "It will be sufiicient at this time to recognize the 
fact that either or both these causes united would have produced a 
tension in the mass of rock which would lead to the production of fis- 
sures in two different directions.'' He felt, further, that the direction 
of the fissures might have been influenced, if not absolutely deter- 
mined, by an elevatory movement of the region in which they are 
developed. 

He looked upon these veins as having been filled from above, the 
various metals having been in solution as sulphates in oceanic water 
at the time of the deposition of the lead-bearing strata, the precipita- 
tion as sulphides being brought about through the agency of sulphu- 
reted-hydrogen gas, which was liberated by the decomposing organic 
matter. This is substantially the view held by most authorities to-day. 
He thought, further, to recognize a general law connecting the lack of 
mineral deposits in the nonfossiliferous strata with their abundance in 
those containing organic remains. As in his previous work (Metallic 
Wealth of United States, p. 438), he differed with both Daniels and 
Owen as to the metalliferous character of the lower magnesian rocks, 



474 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

thinking it quite improbable that they would be found sufficiently rich 
in ores to be worked economically. 

Whatever may have been Richard Owen's powers as a thinker or 
teacher, his key to the Geology of the Globe, published in 1857 
when professor of geology and chemistry in the University of Ten- 
nessee, is beyond question the most extraordinary 

Richard Owen's . »ti 

oeoiogy of the oiobe, travesty on geology and geological methods of deduc- 
tion that has ever emanated from the American press. 
The fundamental idea seems to have been that there are analogies 
between organic and world development. 

Our planet, perhaps, typifies an ovule from the solar matrix. In its earlier igne- 
ous chaotic state it bore analogy to the yet undeveloped amorphous structure of 
vegetable ovules and the animal ovum. Like them, it had at an early period a 
nucleus, on which after a time air and moisture deposited additional materials, 
derived from the matrix. At a later period yet a part of these same materials were 
carried in mechanical mixture, partly in chemical solution, to promote the develop- 
ment of laterformations, forming new continents, etc., just as a portion of the seed 
i the albumen) and the foodyolk of the egg go to nourish the expanding germ. 

The- separation of continents typifies the propagation of offshoots, or artificially by 
cuttings in plants, and seems to resemble the fissiparous mode of reproduction observed 
among the lowest animals. In some of the earlier cataclysms we have the type of 
the ruptured Graafian vesicles, while at a final convulsive deluge, the period when 
the Western Continent and Australia were detached, and when possibly the moon 
as a terrestrial ovule was thrown into space, we readily recognize the type of rup- 
tured pericarpal dissemination of seed in the vegetable world, of completed incuba- 
tion and parturition in the animal kingdom. * * * 

It is by no means contended that this earth is a monstrous organism, with all the 
parts and properties of a plant or animal; but simply that in it we have everything 
developed according to the same laws and plan pervading the rest of creation; that 
in it we see foreshadowed the type of those future forms and changes which organic 
1 xxlies undergo by the assimilation of these very inorganic materials. 

The idea underlying all these generalizations, which the author 
claimed to have gained while studying sundry maps spread out on the 
floor of a vacant room, in order to place before his classes ' ' some great 
principles of generalization,"' is that the "formations of the western 
continent corresponded in many respects to those in the eastern" 
* * * and "that they must have been detached at some period 
from each other." 

He conceived that " the earth in some of its former geological epochs 
occupied a smaller volume than before the whole of the present super- 
ficies emerged from the ocean and than it did before some of the later 
successive layers were deposited on the earlier formations." Further, 
that the original internal nucleus of the earth was of the form of a cube 
or spherical tetrahedron, and that the rocks of the different successive 
geological periods will be found less and less dense in structure as 
they leave the north pole and approach the equator. When these 
beds were upheaved, "the edges of the formations appear to have been 
brought to the surface along concentric lines, which are parts of great

arches intersecting - each other in such a manner as to form equilateral 
spherical triangles on the earth's surface, each angle or intersection 
being equidistant from our present north pole.''' The distribution of 
coal, the metals, and other mineral products he conceived to correspond 
with the lines marking these spherical triangles. 

The forces which acted in separating the planes above described were 
supposed to have originated from the internal fluid, materials being 
thrown into periodical waves by the attraction of the sun and moon, 
creating thereby electrical disturbances, etc. Indeed, the entire earth 
he seemed to regard as a gigantic magnet, made so by the heat of 
the sun. 

Before this separation took' place the layers composing the South 
American continent he supposed to have rested on the layers of sub- 
merged Africa, Australia to have been superimposed upon Arabia, and 
North America over a portion of Europe. 

Owen further called attention to the fact that, if the north pole 
were elevated '2o±- above the horizon and 
the globe then revolved the western coast 
lines of the chief continental masses would 
be brought successively to the horizon, prov- 
ing their parallelism; if depressed to a simi- 
lar extent the parallelism of the eastern 
coasts would lie similarly proven. In other 
words, he showed that the coast lines of the 
continents, as well as of many of the islands. 
tended to conform to the axis of the ecliptic, 
and he regarded this angular distance of 
23^°, which marks the northward extension 
of the sun in summer, as a natural unit of 
measure in the structure of the earth. 

The book contained a large amount of 
utterly irrelevant matter, and the above idea and that relating to the 
possible tetrahedral form of the earth, previously referred to, are the 
only ones put forward in the work that are to-day worthy of consider- 
ation. The book, as a whole, can but impress one as the work of a 
dreamer, and particularly so when one considers also the amount of 
irrelevant matter brought forward and the involved character of many 
of the sentences. Be this as it may, by a peculiar coincidence, at the 
Montreal meeting of the American Association for the Advancement 
of Science in August of this same year, Prof. Benjamin Pierce, of the 
U. S. Coast Survey, brought forward ideas almost identical with Owen's, 
so far as relates to the parallelism of the coasts, and felt disposed to 
regard such conditions as evidence that the sun, by influencing in 
some way the cooling of the crust, had determined the grander outlines.

47C> REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Owen's ideas regarding the tetrahedral form of the earth, though 
perhaps original with him, and put forward here for the first time by 
an American writer, were not wholly new. Those desiring a historical 
review of the subject, with an account of recent advances and theories, 
will find the same in a paper by J. W. Gregory, The Plan of the Earth 
and its Causes, first printed in the Geographical Journal for March, 
1899, and reprinted in the Appendix for the Report of the Smithsonian 
Institution for 1898." 

At the Montreal meeting of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science, for this same year, Logan, referring to pre- 
vious statements by himself relative to a possible subdivision of Azoic 
rocks, as given in his annual reports, describes in some 
subdiVfston oTthe detail a series or group of clastic rocks, consisting of 
siliceous slate and slate conglomerates, holding peb- 
bles of crystal line rocks and sometimes showing ripple marks, which 
he had traced along the north shore of Lake Huron from Sault Ste. 
Marie for 120 miles, and which has also been noted in other parts of 
the Dominion by other observers. 

As noted by him on Lake Huron, the formation was some 10,000 
feet in thickness and plainly of later age than the gneisses, as well as 
of distinct lithological character. For this formation he then formally 
proposed the name Huronian, although the term had been previously 
used in connection with this formation by Murray in 18-18 and Hunt 
in 1855. To the portion of the Azoic immediately underlying the 
Huronian he gave the name Laurentian, after the Laurentide 
Mountains. 

At this same meeting he further suggested a possible subdivision of 
the Laurentian series, in which the calcareous rocks should be con- 
sidered as distinct from the siliceous. This announcement and the 
subsequent discussion led to a mass of literature which is perhaps 
second only to that involved in the Taconic controversy, although, 
fortunately, without'any of its bitterness. Indeed, the entire matter 
is strongly suggestive of Emmons's Taconic, even if the rocks described 
could not be accurately relegated thereto. 

The principal participants in 'this discussion, which is even now 
scarcely at an end, were, aside from Logan, K. D. Irving and Alexander 
Winchell, though many others took part. Later it was apparently 
shown that under the name Huronian two distinct formations were 
comprised, to the older of which A. C. Lawson in 1886 gave the name 
Keewatin.'' 

"Owen's work was briefly noticed in the American Journal of Sciences. Two or 
three pages of his matter were quoted, and dismissed with "Remarks on these pas- 
sages are unnecessary."

ander Winchell, Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, II, 1891, pp. 85-124. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY — : DECADE OF 1850-1859. 477 

During- 1857-58 Prof. J. S. Newberry, as geologist, accompanied the 

corps of topographical engineers, under the immediate direction of 

Lieut. J..C. Ives, on an expedition up the Colorado River from its 

mouth to a point called Fortification Rock, north of 

The Ives Expedition . . ... 

up the Colorado the thirtv-sixth parallel. Ihe mam obieet of the expe- 

River, 1857-58. ... * r . .," l 

dition was to ascertain the navigability of the Colo- 
rado, with especial reference to its availability for the transportation 
of supplies to the various military posts in New Mexico and Utah. 
Newberry entered the country from San Francisco and San Diego, 
and in Chapters I and II of his report makes reference to the generai 
geology of this part of the region. The party, as above noted, 
ascended the river as far as the Great Bend, above Black Canyon, and 
returned thence to the Mojave Valley, south of Pyramid Canyon. 
Thence the homeward route lay eastward overland to Fort Leaven, 
worth b} 7 " way of Sitgreaves and Railroad passes in the Black and 
Cerbat mountains, Bill Williams and the San Francisco mountains, 
Salt Springs of the Little Colorado, northward to the Moqui Pueblos, 
and eastward to Fort Defiance, Santa Fe, and Las Vegas (see map). 
In the latter part of the trip the route lay along that traversed by 
the surveys for a railroad route to the Pacific under Lieut. Whipple, 
with which Jules Marcou was connected as geologist. Newberry's 
report, Part III of the report of Lieutenant Ives, comprised 154 
octavo pages, with 3 plates of fossil invertebrates and plants. 
Made necessarily as a hasty reconnaissance, it nevertheless contains 
interesting generalities. He rightly regarded the canyon of the Colo- 
rado as a canyon of erosion, but conceived that in earlier times the 
river filled to the brim a series of isolated basins formed by the vari- 
ous mountain chains and interlocking spurs of the synclinal trough 
through which the river runs, and that during the lapse of ages "the 
accumulated waters, pouring over the lowest points in the opposing 
barriers, have cut them down from summit to base," thus forming 
the canyons. The massive granite walls of Pyramid Canyon, with 
their capping of stratified gravel, he regarded as conclusive proof of 
the former existence here of an unbroken barrier "stretching across 
the course of the Colorado and raising its waters to an elevation of at 
least 250 feet above their present level." The idea of a possible uplift 
across the river's course, an uplift so slow as to be counteracted by 
erosion, as afterward taught b} 7 Dutton, was undreamed of, and the 
mental restorations of past surface contours given are at times start- 
ling for their magnitude. Thus, in accounting for the presence of the 
large bowlders in the gravel of Elephant Head south of the entrance 
to Black Canyon, with its walls of porphyry from 800 to 1,200 feet in 
height, he wrote: 

When the Colorado began the task of cutting down the gigantic wall at the 
point where its accumulated waters, in greater volume than now, poured down its

southwestern declivity, the cascade which it formed must have surpassed any simi- 
lar exhibition of nature's forces of which we have knowledge at the present day. 

On page 42 of his report Newberry gave a section of the Grand 
Canyon, showing the bottom granite overlain by Potsdam sandstone, 
and this by Silurian (?), Devonian (?■), and Lower Carboniferous (?) 
rocks, and, finally, Upper Carboniferous limestone. This was the first 
section of these beds ever published. 

The source of the materials which go to make up the sedimentary 
rocks of the West, he thought, could not have been derived from the 
emerged surfaces east of the Mississippi, but were rather "formed by 
the incessant action of the Pacific waves on shores that perhaps for 
hundreds of miles succumbed to their power, and by broad and rapid 
rivers which flowed from the mountains and through the fertile valley 
of a primeval Atlantis.' 1 The outlines of the western part of the 
North American continent, to his mind, were approximately marked 
out by groups of islands, broad continental surfaces of dry land, and 
areas of shallow water from the earliest Paleozoic times. 

As already noted, a portion of Newberry's return route lay along 
that previously (in 1853-1854) traversed by Marcou, and it is interesting 
to note the different views of the two, offered by this opportunity for 
comparison. Thus Newberry questions Marcou's determination of 
the age of the formations near Partridge and Cedar creeks, near Bill 
Williams Mountain, Marcou regarding them as Devonian and Lower 
Carboniferous (Mountain limestone), while Newberry thought them to 
be not older than Carboniferous. In like manner Newberry ques- 
tioned the Permian age of the Canyon Diablo beds, rightly regarding 
the same as Carboniferous, and the red sandstone overlying this lime- 
stone as likely to prove Permian or Triassic. The yellow sandstone 
along the Rio Grande was considered as not Jurassic, but Cretaceous. 

In 1859 Newberry again took the field, this time in connection with 

a topographic party under Capt. J. N. Macomb. The party left Santa 

Fe, New Mexico, about the middle of July and, crossing the Rio 

Grande del Norte, followed up the valley of the River

with the Macomb Chama, finally leaving it at the dividing ridge between

the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and those or the 
Gulf of California. From here they struck across the headwaters of 
the San Juan River, passing along the southern base of the Sierra de 
la Plata, and then northerly to the junction of the Grand and Green 
rivers. Thence the party proceeded southward to the San Juan River, 
which they followed up as far as Canyon Largo, passing thence down 
the valley of the Puerco to the old pueblo of Jemez, and thence east- 
erly back to Santa Fe. The route, it will be perceived, thus covered

part of the territory previously gone over in connection with the Ives 
expedition. 

The report, though written in 1860, was not published until 1876, 
owing to the outbreak of the civil war. It comprised an octavo vol- 
ume of 148 pages, with 8 full -page plates of fossil plants and inverte- 
brates, and a map of the route traversed. Some of the conclusions 
arrived at during the work of the Ives expedition were confirmed by 
the more recent work. Perhaps the most interesting of the results as 
given related to the orographic movements attendant upon the eleva- 
tion of the Rocky Mountains. 

His conclusions were to the effect that — 

First. The Rock} 7 Mountains existed in embryo, at least, previous 
to the deposition of the older Paleozoic rocks, the presence of the 
upheaved Potsdam sandstone in the Black Hills region showing con 
clusively that this part of the country was buried beneath the waters 
of the primeva' "^ean. 

Second. Volcanic activity, which began as early as the Middle Ter- 
tiary, continued even into the present epoch. 

Third. Previous to the deposition of the Lower Cretaceous strata 
the central portion of the continent was above the ocean level, the 
main portion of the Cretaceous sediments being deposited during the 
period in which a subsidence of several thousand feet took place. 

Fourth. At the close of the Cretaceous age a period of elevation 
began, which continued to the drift epoch. This was succeeded by a 
period of depression and again by one of elevation. 

Fifth. The great elevatory movement of the Rocky Mountains took 
place between the close of the Cretaceous period and that of the 
Miocene Tertiary. 

Newberry was born in Connecticut, but his parents moving to Ohio 
when he was but two years of age, he passed his boyhood in what was 
then the western frontier. His father, in 1828, then living at Cuya- 
hoga Falls, opened up the coal mines at Tallmadge, 
sketch of Newberry, making the first systematic attempt at introducing coal 
for fuel along the lake shore region. The abundant 
and beautiful fossil flora found in the roof shales of these mines 
undoubtedly did much toward turning the young man's thoughts 
toward science, and a visit from James Hall in 1841, while he was but 
nineteen years of age, still further stimulated his interest. He grad- 
uated at the Western Reserve College in 1846, and afterwards studied 
medicine, receiving the degree of M. D. in 1848. Two } ? ears were 
then passed in study abroad, during which time he made his first 
scientific publication — a description of a fossil-fish locality at Monte 
Bolca, Italy. In 1851 he returned to America and began the pursuit 
of medicine at Cleveland, but although acquiring a large practice he 
was soon induced to give it up and enter upon a wider field of useful-

ness. In 1855 he became connected with Lieut. U. S. \Yilliston's sur- 
vey in California, and later with that of the Ives Expedition to explore 
the Colorado, as well as with that of Capt. J. N. Macomb to explore 
the San Juan region of Colorado and adjacent portions of Arizona, 
Utah, and New Mexico, as noted. In 1857 he became attached to the 
Smithsonian Institution in Washington and also accepted a professor- 
ship in Columbian University in the same city. 

During the civil war he was attached to the Sanitary Commission, 
and in 1866 became professor of geology and paleontology in the 
School of Mines of Columbia College. New York, with which institu- 
tion he remained connected until the time of his death in 1892. In 
1869 he assumed charge of the geological survey of Ohio, as noted 
elsewhere. That the survey, in common with most "others of its kind, 
came to an untimely end was no serious reflection upon Doctor New- 
berry, though, as his biographer remarks, a mistake was undoubtedly 
made in postponing the economic portions of the work until the last, 
and thereby arousing the antagonism of the rural members, one of 
whom is quoted as Inning remarked that too much money was devoted 
to "clams and salamanders." Newberry also did a large amount of 
paleontological work in connection with the surveys of Illinois. New 
Jersey, and the United States surveys under Hayden and Powell. His 
most important Avorks were those in connection with the Illinois and 
Ohio surveys, and two monographs published by the United States 
Survey, one on the Paleozoic Fishes of North America, and the other 
on the Flora of the Ambov Clays of New Jersey, the latter being 
edited by Dr. Arthur Hollick after Newberry's death. 

Newberry is described as a man whose personality inspired confi- 
dence in others, though possessing little of what is known as executive 
ability — a man of kindly, cheerful disposition, and whose desire for 
fame never went so far as to cause him to assume credit for others 
work. A pleasing writer and conversationalist and accomplished mu- 
sician, he made many friends and retained to the end the respect and 
love of all who knew him. 

His .shortcomings were known to his friends as well as were his excellencies; lie 
was impetuous and sometimes he was severe, possibly unjust, in judging men or in 
dealing with them. But of bitterness he knew little; of forgiveness he knew much. 
His defects were those of a strong man; in many they would have been sources oi 
weakness, but somehow they seemed to make his friends stand more firmly by linn. 

Newberry's work received prompt and ready recognition both at 
home and abroad. He was a charter member of the National Academy 
of Sciences; foreign correspondent of the London Geological Society, 
receiving the Murchison medal in 1888; president of the American 
Association for the Advancement of Science in 1867; president of the 
New York Academy of Science for twenty-five years; vice-president

of the Geological Society of America, and president of the Interna- 
tional Congress of Geologists in 1891, although then too ill to attend 
its meetings. 

April 20, 1857, D. D. Owen, while State geologist of Kentucky, was 
appointed by the governor of Arkansas geologist of that State, the 
appointment to take effect "from and after the first (Jay of October, 
David Dale and 1857," at which time it was supposed the Kentucky 

Richard Owen's work would be brought to a close. Owen selected for 

work in Arkansas, » 

1857-1860. h} s assistants, E. T. Cox and Leo Lesquereux, with 

Joseph Lesley, for topographer, and Robert Peter and W. Elderhorst, 
chemists. Two large octavo volumes, comprising together some 689 
pages, were issued in 1858 and L860, the first having been printed 
apparently at Little Rock and the second in Philadelphia. They were 
illustrated with colored lithographs and engravings after originals in 
Owen's well-known style. 

On paleontological evidence the zinc and lead-bearing rock of north- 
western Arkansas, i. e., the 300 feet of Magnesian limestone and silico- 
calcareous rock that underlie the marble strata, forming about 250 to 
300 feet of the lower and main body of the ridges of Marion County, 
were put down as of Lower Silurian age. and as in all probability 
belonging to that subdivision known as the Caleiferous sandrock of 
the New York system. The "marble limestones' 1 of northwestern 
Arkansas he was unable to fix definitely, but seemed to think it prob- 
able they would prove to represent the Onondaga of New York. 

As to the origin of the lead ores, he wrote: 

My impression is that the lead ore once occupied these north and south crevices, 
and was subsequently removed, in part or in whole, into its present bed by trans- 
portation, analogous to that known to mineralogists under the name of the pseudo- 
morphous process, by which one mineral is removed while another takes its place, 
assuming often the form of the first mineral instead of the usual form belonging to 
itself. * * * That it should have been deposited like a limestone or sandstone 
is altogether improbable, and contrary to the usual nature of such ponderous and 
difficultly soluble minerals. 

The cause of the hot springs Owen considered to be the "internal 
heat of the earth.'' Not that the waters came actually in "contact 
with fire,'*' but rather that they w T ere completely permeated with 
"higbJry heated vapors and gases which emanate from sources deeper 
seated than the water itself." 

The snowy white novaculite from the vicinity of the hot springs he 
believed to be of the age of the millstone grit, and "once a simple 
ordinary sandstone. From the state of ordinary sandrock it has 
been altered or metamorphosed into this exquisitely tine material, not 
as I conceive, by contact with fire or igneous rock, but by the per- 
meation of heated alkaline siliceous waters." Through this permea- 
tion he conceived that "the particles of solid rock have been gradually 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1850-1859. 483 

changed from grains of quartzose sand to impalpable silica, and the 
greater part of the oxide of iron, manganese, and other impurities 
carried out in solution from the pores of the rock, leaving nearly 
chemically pure silica behind." Such changes are practically incon- 
ceivable, and the best authorities to-day regard the novaculites as 
siliceous replacement of limestone. 

A large number of soil analyses were made by Doctor Peter "'with 
a view to settle that very important question' 1 whether such can be of 
utility to the agriculturist in showing the relative fertility of soils 
and the loss sustained by cultivation. In Owen's opinion such utility 
was established "in the most incontrovertible manner." 

Owen, it should be noted, died in 1860, and before the publication of 
the second report, which was brought out under the direction of. his 
brother Richard." 

Prof. Lewis Harper, whose work in Mississippi has been already 
referred to (p. 441). was succeeded as State geologist by K. W. Hilgard, 
under whose efficient direction there was brought about the first and, 
thus far, only systematic survey of the entire State. 
sur Z ve r vof Geo!ogical His Report on the Geology and Agriculture of the 
i857-i S 860.' State of Mississippi appeared in 18(10. It contained a 

systematic and fairly detailed account of the various 
formations of the State, together with a table of the formations, as 
shown on next page, the classification and terminology adopted being 
that of Safford and Tuomev. 



"According to Brainier (Journal of Geology, II, 1894, p. 826) the appropriations 
for this survey were vigorously combated by some of the legislators, one of whom, 
in his attempts to defeat the bill, introduced the following amendment: 

Sec. 12. The same amount which is appropriated to the State geologist shall 
likewise be appropriated to a phrenologist, and a like amount to an orni- 

thologist and their several assistants, who shall likewise lie appointed by the gov- 
ernor, and shall continue in office fifty-four years * * *; and the secretary of 
state shall forward one copy of each report to the governor of each State in the 
Union except such as may be known to be Mack republican governors; also, one 
copy to the Queen of England and to the Emperors of France and Russia; also, a 
copy to the Queen of Spain: provided that government will sell Cuba to the United 
States on reasonable terms. 

Sec. 14. It shall be the duty of the phrenologist to examine and report upon the 
heads of all the free white male and female citizens in the State, and their children,

The Orange sand of Safford was shown 
to characterize the greater part of the sur- 
face of the State, and he regarded it as 
proved beyond question that its deposition 
had taken place in floating- water, the gen- 
eral direction of the current of which was 
from north to south. By far the greater 
portion of the State was shown to be occu- 
pied by deposits of Tertiary age, leaving out

AMERICAN GEOLOGY— DECADE OF 1850-1859. 485 

At a meeting of the St. Louis Academy of Sciences, held on Feb- 
ruary 18, L858, Prof. G. C. Swallow presented a paper announcing- the 
finding of Permian fossils among some collections submitted to him for 
identification by Maj. F. Hawn. This, as being- the 

The Kansas Permian n j. ,1 .1 ,• , 1 

controversy, 1858. nist apparently authentic announcement or the occur- 
rence of Permian rocks on the American continent, 
excited a great deal of interest and started a somewhat bitter personal 
controversy between Hawn, Swallow, and Meek, which may be 
referred to in some detail." 

Hawn, it appears, was a civil engineer engaged in the linear survey 
of Kansas, but whose interest in matters geological led him to make 
extensive collections of fossils. These, for purposes of identification, 
he divided, sending the supposed Cretaceous forms to F. B. Meek, 
then at Albany, New York, and the Carboniferous to (i. C. Swallow, 
at Columbia, Missouri, the particular collection referred to in this 
controversy being made at the Smoky Hill Fork of the Kansas River. 

The collections received by Meek were of such a character as to 
lead him to think that the beds from which they were taken might be 
Triassic or Permian, though perhaps belonging to the Upper Coal 
Measures. He immediately wrote Hawn, asking that he obtain for 
him other materials and, if possible, get from Professor Swallow all 
all of those forwarded to him which were not Carboniferous. To 
this Hawn readily agreed and wrote as follows: 

Professor Swallow certainly will not attempt to interfere with you in this matter. 
He knows perfectly well the relation existing between us and expressed himself 
gratified that I was furnishing you with important information in furtherance of your 
investigation. Furthermore, he. has not the data to establish a relation between the 
several points under review by you. I merely sent him the ( larboniferous fossils for 
classification and comparison with those of the Missouri collection, that a parallel 
may be established in my further operations. 

Again, under date of September .">, L857, Hawn wrote to Meek: 

[ wrote to Professor Swallow * * * and requested him particularly to send you 

all the fossils that were not Carboniferous, as they were intended for your use. I 
hope lie will comply with my request, as I shall not have time to go to see him. 

And again, under date of September 9, of the same year: 

Should this formation turnout to he as you anticipate, new and important, will 
you discuss the details in an article for my contemplated work on the mineral and 
agricultural characteristics of K. T., and describe the fossils that are new" 

Under date of January 4, 1858, he wrote again: 

1 have a letter before me from Professor- Swallow in which he thinks the speci- 
mens sent him from Smoky Hill Fork are Carboniferous. Therefore suppose he has 

"It should be noted that Marcou claimed priority in the discovery of Permian 
(Dyas) beds in America, the discovery having been made while connected with the 
Pacific Kailroad survey in 1853. (See his American Geological Classification and 
Nomenclature, Cambridge, 1888. ) The correctness of his paleontological identifica- 
tion was questioned by Meek, White, Hall, and Newberry.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1004. 



nut senl you any fossils. Of course, I should not set up mylirhited knowledge in 
opposition, bu1 I certainly have forms unknown to me and not occurring in Carbon- 
iferous rocks of Missouri which T examined. 

Under these conditions it is difficult to understand why Hawn 
should have later entered into a partnership with Swallow for the 
working up of the collections and the publication of the results, and 
it is perhaps not to be wondered at that Meek should have denounced 
the proceeding somewhat harshly in a paper prepared under the joint 
auspices of himself and Hayden and read before the Albany Institute 
on March )> of that year. Hawn, in a subsequent letter to Meek, excused 
himself on the ground that Meek's letters had led him to believe that 
he had abandoned the investigation for want of time or for want of 
confidence in the final result, and that consequently he brought the 
matter to the attention of Swallow with the urgent request that the 
collections be worked up immediately, and at the same time notified 

him of Meek's suggestion regarding their 
Permian nature. Swallow himself wrote a 
very conciliatory note to Meek, which seems, 
however, to have been far from healing the 
breach between the parties most concerned. 
The facts of the matter, so far as they can 
be made out, both from the publications and 
the letters now in the archives of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, seem to show that, be- 
yond question, Meek was the first to recog- 
nize the possible Permian nature of the 
fossils in question; that he so notified Hawn, 
and supposed the matter was so arranged 
that he could work the materials up at his 
leisure. In the meantime Hawn, as sug- 
gested in his letter, thinking that Meek had laid the matter aside, 
brought it to Swallow's attention, who published the matter with 
almost unseemly haste in the Transactions," as well as in the local 
newspapers of the day. In addition, he gave the substance of the dis- 
covery in a letter to Dana, dated February 16, which was published as 
an appendix of the American Journal of Science for March of that 
same year/' 

On the 8th of March of this same year B. F. Shumard announced, 
at the Academy of Sciences at St. Louis, that certain fossils which his

anxiety to claim priority in a discovery, the importance of which was greatly over-

incumbent upon ourselves to state that it has been prepared in great haste, in the 
midst of other pressing duties," etc.

In the American Journal of Science for May of the year following 

(1859), Meek and Hayden had a paper on the so-called Triassic rocks

recent work has shown that beds, the equivalent of the true European 
Permean, are present in Kansas, Nebraska, the Guadalupe Mountains, 
and perhaps in other parts of the West as well. 

Information regarding the geology of Texas up to this date (1858) 
had been gradually accumulating through the work of geologists con- 
nected with the various exploring expeditions, and more particularly 
through Ferdinard Roemer's publications. Roemer, it

to, to take charge of a work so important as the survey of this State, I need not 
inform you. What he knows of geology has not been gathered from study, but 
from conversations with geologists. Thus he at first made the Coal Measures of Fort

He then took some of the same fossils that he relied upon to prove their Tertiary

But one report was issued, a pamphlet of IT pages, bearing the date 
1859. It very briefly outlined the work accomplished, laying con- 
siderable emphasis upon the presence of coal and other economic 
products, including petroleum. George G. Shumard was assistant 
geologist, W. P. Riddell, chemist, and A. lloessler, draftsman. 

In a letter to J. D. Dana, and by the latter printed in the American 
Journal of Science for April, 1858, Professor Safford, then at Cumber- 
land University, Lebanon, Tennessee, called attention to an important 
safford on the anc ^ previously unrecognized unconformability existing

and insisted, for the same reason, that I should not give him the place of assistant. 
He has been a politician ad his life and for many years edited a leading political 
paper in this State. No one in this State believes him to be a geologist, although 
for political reasons some profess to think so. I believe conscientiously that if the 
geological survey of this State is abolished, it will be done through the maneuvering 
of Dr. M.'s friends or himself. It would have been abolished last winter had the 
legislature entertained the opinion that Dr. M. would be placed in charge of the 
survey. The people throughout the State feel a great interest in the survey. But 
the important work will assuredly cease with the next legislature if Houston makes 
the change. I do not know what encouragement Gov. Houston has given Dr. M. 
He (Houston) has removed everyone of Runnel's appointees, except myself, and 
but for the interference of some of Houston's warmest admirers I should have shared 
the same fate ere this. I have had indirect assurances from influential Houston 
men that I am not to lie disturbed. It may he, however, that he would like to 
remove me simply from his hatred to Runnels, and that he would like to shield 
himself behind testimonials in Dr. M's favor from such men as Professors Henry, 
Bache, and yourself. Or it may be that Dr. M. wishes the testimonials merely to 
induce Houston to give him the place. < >f one thing 1 am quite certain, and that is,

probably elevated al the close <»!' ffhe Lower Silurian period and not 
again depressed until the beginning of the period marked by the 
deposition of the black shale (Upper Devonian). Later, in 1859, Sat* 
ford pointed out the fact that the crinoidal and variegated marbles 
and ferruginous limestones of eastern Tennessee were originally 
deposited in the form of long, narrow belts, .stretching in a northeast 
and southwest direction entirely across the State. This striking fea- 
ture he accounted for on the supposition that the materials were 
deposited in long and narrow troughs, formed by earlier oscillations or 
corrugations of the earth's crust, the conditions thus confirming the 
views held by Professor Dana as to the early Silurian age of the begin- 
nings of the Appalachian oscillations. " 

The geological survey of Pennsylvania, established under H. D. 
Rogers in 1836, came, it will be remembered, to an untimely end in 
1842'. Rogers being, however, unwilling to relinquish the work in its 
unfinished condition, continued it at his own expense 
Reports°on r the ma until he was able in L847 to make his tinal report to 
Pennsylvania, 1858. the office of the secretary of the Commonwealth. 
Here, for some unknown reason, the manuscript was 
allowed to lie until the spring of 1851, when appropriations were made 
for revising it and bringing it up to date. The appropriations were 
continued until 1855. 

Gross mismanagement of the funds, for which, it is said, Rogers was 
in no way responsible, prevented the publication of the report, how- 
ever, and it was not until 1858 that it was finally issued, and then only 
under a special contract between the author and the State, whereby 
the latter was to furnish the sum of $16,000 and Rogers was to receive 
1,000 copies of the book and the original manuscript. The work was 
issued by W. Blackwood & Sons, London and Edinburgh, and J. P. 
Lippincott & Co., of Philadelphia, and was in the form of two quarto 
volumes containing 1,631 pages, with 23 full page plates, 18 folded 
sheets of sections, and 778 figures and diagrams in the text. 

This was an epoch-making work, and beyond question the most 
important document on the geology of America that had appeared up 
to the date of issue, with the possible exception of the final reports of 
the New York surveys, issued in 1842-43. From these it so differed, 
however, as to be considered quite by itself. In the New York sur 



" These views are again advanced by Ulrich and Schuchert (Report of the New- 
York State Paleontologist for 1901, pp. 633-663), who state that several folds were 
developed <>r older ones accentuated at the close of Beekmantown (Calciferous) time. 
Between these folds of the southern Appalachians during later Lower Siluric times 
was the "Lenoir Basin," "containing several disconnected longitudinal folds high 
enough to affect the direction of currents and consequently the character of the sedi- 
ments, and, in a smaller degree, faunal distribution. ' The variegated marbles are 
in the western or "Knoxville trough " of this basin. 



490 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

vey .stratigraphy based upon organic remains was ever uppermost. 
In the case of the Rogers reports quite the reverse is true, the physical 
side preponderating over everything else. While the value of fossils 
in determining the relative age of strata was recognized, yet out of the 
entire 1,631 pages but 20 are devoted to invertebrate paleontology 
and 47 —by Lesquereux — to a description and discussion of the fossil 
flora of the Coal Measures. Naturally, many of the results given in 
these reports and the opinions expressed had found their way into 
print several years earlier, particularly through the publication of the 
American Association of Geologists and Naturalists. Especially was 
this the case with the results relative to Appalachian structure. 

Rogers was aided by a considerable corps of assistants, many of 
whom afterwards became noted in the same lines of work. In 1836 
these were John F. Frazer and dames C. Booth: in 1837, Messrs. S. S. 
Haldeman, A. McKinley, C. B. Trego, and J. D. Whelpley. with 
Dr. R. E. Rogers as chemist. In 1838 Messrs. H. D. Holl, J. T. 
Hodge, R. M. Jackson, J. C. McKinney, P. W. Schaeffer, T. Ward, 
and M. H. Boye were added to tin 1 force. In 1839 J. Peter Lesley 
and Doctor Henderson were added in place of Messrs. Whelpley and 
McKinney, who resigned. In 1840 the personnel was essentially the 
same. In 1841 it was reduced to Messrs. McKinley, Holl, Jackson, 
Lesley, Boye. and Doctor Rogers. In 1851 the geological assistants 
were Prof. E. Desor and W. B. Rogers, jr., Peter Lesley and A. A. 
Dalson serving as topographers. 

The first volume of these reports treated of the metamorphic rocks 
and the Paleozoic strata. The second volume began with a discussion 
of the coal basins of the State, to which over 600 pages were devoted. 
Some 3o pages were devoted to a discussion of the rocks of the Meso- 
zoic red sandstone series, which was followed by a discussion, first 
upon the igneous rocks and minerals with special bearing upon their 
economic value; second, the conditions of the physical geography 
during the laying down of the Paleozoic strata of the United States; 
third, the organic remains of the State; fourth, the laws of structure 
of the more disturbed zones of the earth's crust; fifth, the classifica- 
tion of the several types of petrographic structure illustrated in the 
Appalachians; sixth, the coal fields of the United States and British 
provinces, with their chemical and physical characters; seventh, the 
method of searching for, opening, and mining coal, as pursued in 
Pennsylvania; eighth, foreign coal fields and coal trade and statistics 
of the iron trade. 

The liontossiliferous rocks underlying the old Paleozoic were classi- 
fied as Hypozoic or true metamorphic and Azoic or semimetamorphic, 
the Hypozoic including the true gneisses and crystalline schists, and 
the Azoic or semimetamorphic strata * ' various coarse talcoid and

chloritic schists, semiporphyritic, arenaceous grits and conglomerates, 
and jaspery and plumbaginous slates," carrying veins and dikes of a 
metalliferous character. 

He recognized the difficulty in at all times separating the Azoic 
rocks from the overlying genuine Paleozoic, and also the fact that it 
might at times grade into it without a break. Also he recognized 
the fact that a portion of his Lower Paleozoic was metamorphic or 
semimetamorphic. When one reflects on how emphatically Rogers 
combated Emmons's Taconic system, it seems strange that he should 
hold to these views. 

The belt of metamorphic and semimetamorphic strata extending 
from Newfoundland to Alabama he designated as the Appalachian or 
Atlantic Belt, and the one extending westward from the north coast 
of the St. Lawrence Gulf to the Great Lakes as the Laurentide, 
owing to the fact that these latter rocks were well developed in the 
Laurentide Mountains. 

The semimetamorphic Azoic rocks he considered as richer in miner- 
als than the true gneisses, and to these he referred the schists of the 
Atlantic coasts, bearing lead, copper, zinc, and iron, and the auriferous 
quartz veins of California. 

The Paleozoic formation proper, which was estimated to cover prob- 
ably one-half of the total area of the United States and to have a total 
thickness of from 30,000 to 35,000 feet, was divided into fifteen distinct 
series or sets of formations, "extending from the deposits which wit- 
nessed the very dawn of life upon the globe to those which saw the 
close ^i' the long American Paleozoic day." The names assigned to 
these formations he regarded as "significant of the different natural 
periods into which the day divides itself, from the earliest dawn to 
twilight." These were, beginning with the oldest, Primal, Auroral, 
Matinal, Levant, Surgent, Scalent, Pre-Meridian, Meridian, Post- 
Meridian, Cadent, Vergent, Ponent, Vespertine, Umbral, and Serai — 
signifying the Dawn, Daybreak, Morning, Sunrise, Ascending day, 
High morning, Forenoon, Noon. Afternoon, Waning day. Descending 
day, Sunset, Evening, Dusk, and Nightfall. These terms, based on 
time, he considered preferable to the inexpressive ones, mainly of a 
geographic character, then in vogue. 

The Primal, Auroral, and Matinal were regarded as the approximate 
representatives of Sedgwick's Cambrian; the Levant, Surgent, Scalent, 
and Pre-Meridian, near representatives of the English Silurian, begin- 
ning with the Upper Caradoc Sandstones. He recognized both a 
physical and paleontological break in the succession of strata at the 
contact of these two great divisions of the Paleozoic system. At the 
base of the Carboniferous he thought to recognize a break correspond- 
ingly sharp.

Trenton Limestone, Utica and 
Hudson River slates. 

Black River, Chazy limestone, 
and Calciferous sandstone. 

Potsdam. 



The .sediments making up these Paleozoic strata were, according to 
his views, derived from a land area now occupied, by the Tertiary 
seaboard plain and the waters of the Atlantic Ocean. This deposition 
was preceded by a wide movement of depression, which began in the 
south or southwest and permitted the waters of the Appalachian sea 
to occupy what is now the upper half of the southern Atlantic slope. 
There was, however, left above water to the southeast of the present 
Atlantic plain, a large tract of continent or great chain of islands 
which, with numerous fluctuations in their limits, remained as such 
down to the close of the Carboniferous period. 

He considered it as "susceptible of demonstration that the various 
coal basins, bituminous and anthracitic, of Pennsylvania, Maryland, 
Ohio, Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee were originally united," 
"the whole as one great formation." This is essentially the view held 
to-day. The structure of the coal, as lie viewed it, rendered " it ap- 
parent that no irregular dispersion of the vegetable matter by any 
conceivable mode of drifting * * * could produce the phenomena 
which they exhibit," and he could not conceive of "'any state of the 
surface adapted to account for these appearances, but that in which 
the margin of the sea was occupied by vast marine savannahs of some 
peat-creating plant, growing half immersed on a perfectly horizontal 
plain, and this fringed and interspersed with forests of trees, shedding 
their leaves on the marsh." In this he agreed with Beaumont, though 
his evidence was of different character. He further believed that the 
coal material became finally engulfed through earthquake action, the 
sea receding and then returning once more laden with detritus, carry- 
ing everything before it and reaching far inland. Thus the entire 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1850 L859. 4 ( .»H 

marginal forest growth might be uprooted and as the sea again 
retreated the material would be spread broadcast and mixed with 
coarse rock detritus. When finally the earthquake paroxysms ceased 
and the sea became quiet, the fine silt in suspension was deposited, 
forming thus the soil for another growth. 

The regular decrease in the amount of volatile bituminous matter in 
the coal as one passes from west to east was accredited to the action 
of the— 

prodigious quantity of intensely heated steam ami gaseous matter emitted through 
the crust of the earth, by the almost infinite number of cracks and crevices which 
must have been produced during the undulation and permanent bending of the strata. 
The coal in the east basin would thus be effectually steamed, and raised in tempera- 
ture in every part of the mass would discharge its bituminous matter in proportion 
to the energy of the disturbance. 

Rogers, it should be noted, found in the American Carboniferous no 
recognizable base defined by organic remains alone, and in his classifi- 
cation relied mainly on the suddenness of the change from marine to 
terrestrial forms and the rapid appearance of that amazing vegetation 
characteristic of the coal period. 

He conceived the Connecticut red sandstone ;b having been depos- 
ited on sloping shores within a narrow estuary, its greatest depth near 
its eastern margin, the material itself having been derived from the 
west. The sandstone west of the Hudson in New York State he 
believed to have been deposited in an estuary having its greatest depth 
to the northwest, the materials being derived from the southeast. 
The period, he argued, was ushered in by a sudden agitation of the 
region, resulting in an abrupt depression of the tidal portions of each 
tract below the general ocean level. Into these depressions the sud- 
denly displaced drainage would drop a lot of fragmentary material 
such as would form the lower lying conglomerates. Finer materials 
brought in later by stream action, and more or less modified by tides, 
formed the upper beds. He agreed with Emmons in regarding these 
Mesozoic sands as of Jurassic and Oolitic age. 

One of the most important chapters in the work related to types of 
orographic structure and the physical structure of the Appalachian 
chain, which was worked out in conjunction with his brother. Prof. 
William B. Rogers. This formed the substance of a paper read 
before the Association of American Geologists at its third session in 
April, 1842, and already noted under that date (see p. M7<»). It is 
well to recall, however, that, under the title of Dislocation of <tn 
Anticlinal Axis Plant — Uninverted Sid, of War, Shoved Over the 
Inverted, he described and illustrated the overthrust faults of the 
modern geologist, and remarked on their misleading character, owing to 
the resulting dipping of younger strata beneath those which are older. 

The origin of valleys occupying the crests of anticlinal ridges, which 
he designated as ''valleys of elevation," he rightly described as due to 



494 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

the carving force of waters. The mountains themselves he thought to 
have been elevated by successive but sudden earthquake movements 
through and above the ocean; the water of which, as a consequence, 
was propelled in gigantic billows and rushing sheets transversely across 
the anticlinal ridges, scooping them out where weakest into the form 
of terraced oval valleys. 

Slaty cleavage was looked upon as due not to movement, purely, but 
to the action of haat waves traversing the rocks. In proof of this, 
he cited his observations to the effect that, in gneisses lying in an 
undisturbed horizontal position, the foliation is almost invariably coin- 
cident with the stratification, the heat producing it having flowed 
upward, invading stratum after stratum. Where granite occurs invad- 
ing gneissic strata, the foliation, according to his views, is parallel to 
the plane of outflowing heat. He thought to discover two general 
laws: First, that the planes of foliation "are parallel to the waxes of 
heat which have been transmitted through the strata, " and second, 
"the foliation is parallel or approximately so to the cleavage, when 
both occur in the same rock mass. 

A singular and, to the present writer, unaccountable discrepancy in 
the work of Rogers lies in his almost completely ignoring the latest 
glacial views as advocated by Agassiz and others. The fact that the 
greater part of the work was completed and the manuscript prepared 
prior to L848 can scarcely be considered a sufficient reason, since the 
years 1851-1855 were devoted to its revision and bringing it up to date. 
Moreover, his mention of the fact that the marine Pleistocene forma- 
tion of Canada had been designated Laurentian clays by Desor (in 
1850), shows that he was at least conversant with the literature of the 
period; the fact that he had considered, if not fully comprehended, 
Agassiz's views, is shown by a brief paragraph, in which he described 
and figured drift stria? seen on an exposed surface of Umbral sand- 
stone on the south side of the Wyoming Valley. These are described 
as pointing up the slope toward the southwest, "as if produced by 
fragmentary debris violently propelled against the sloping mountain 
wall of the valley from the north." The presence of such ascending 
stria?, both here and elsewhere, effectually refuted, according to his 
conception of it, the glacial theory of their origin. Like Hitchcock, 
he failed to conceive of other than local mountain glaciers of the Swiss 
type. Without mentioning the name of Agassiz or other of his col- 
laborators than that of Desor. he gave the following, even then anti- 
quated matter, after a general discussion of the distribution of the 
drift and the various phenomena accompanying it. For tin' earlier 
drift, it should be noted, he offered no explanation whatever other 
than implied in a reference to a period of repose which w " separated 
the convulsed epochs of the earlier general and later local drift." 

A ready explanation of the origin of this newest Pleistocene deposit (i. e., that of 
the Hudson and Lake Champlain districts) suggests itself when we consider the. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1850-1859. 495 

nature and energy of the crust movements which lifted the Laurentian clays and 
sands to a height, in one locality at least, of not less than 500 feet, and which drained 
wide tracts of the Upper Laurentian lakes. The mere agitation or pulsating move- 
ment of the. crust, if unaccompanied by any permanent uplift of the land, would 
suffice we would think, by lashing the waters of the tidal estuaries in one quarter 
and the lakes in the other, to strew a portion of the older drift bordering all those 
basins in wide dispersion upon the top of the more tranquil sediments; but if such a 
pulsation of the crust were accompanied with successive paroxysmal liftings of wide 
tracts of the land, then the inundation would take the form of stupendous currents, 
the strewing power of which would he adequate to any amount of superficial trans- 
portation, even to the remote transportation of the larger erratics. 

His ideas regarding vein formation and the origin of quartzite were 
equally crude. Thus, speculating on the wide distribution of the Pots- 
dam sandstone, its remarkable uniformity and purely quartzose nature, 
he wrote with particular reference to the last: 

May we not conjecture that this * * * was supplied from the meat dikes and 
veins of auriferous quartz, which * * issued in a melted condition through the 

rents and tissures of the crust overall the region of the Atlantic slope. * 
Outgushing bodies of this quartz mingled with volcanic steam, and suddenly chilled 
and pelted upon by cold and heavy rains, may have been granulated into sand, as 
would occur with heated unannealed glass, and then washed in copious streams into 
broad, shallow, and tide-moved sea, and there gradually dispersed and precipitated. 

From the above it will appear that Rogers was a catastrophist. 
Further than that, viewed in the light of to-da} T , many of the conclu- 
sions which he drew from observed phenomena and the theories 
advanced are strikingly absurd for a man of his learning. This is 
particularly true with reference to his ideas on the formation of anthra- 
cite (p. 372), the origin of valleys (p. 493) and mountain chains (p. 371 ). 
and that of the Potsdam sandstone just mentioned. Indeed, his entire 
work well illustrates the peculiar, uneven make-up (if I may be allowed 
the expression) of some of our best workers. Gifted with a mind 
unequaled for power of observation and deduction, he was yet wholly 
deficient in theory." " Great men, of great gifts you shall easily find. 
but symmetrical men, never." 



"The work was favorably reviewed in the American Journal of Science for Novem- 
ber, 1859, almost the only unfavorable criticism relating to the deficiency of paleon- 
tological work and the geological nomenclature adopted. "The author has left this 
great department ( of paleontology) of the survey to future workers. This being so, 
the author has hardly a broad enough basis for the institution of a new system of 
nomenclature and of subdivisions for the Paleozoic formations, and especially for 
diverging in these respects from the New York survey, in which the subdivisions 
had been founded upon a thorough study of the organic remains. The names of 
these subdivisions, Auroral, Matinal, Levant, Surgent, and so on. can not be proved 
to be better than those before adopted. They are founded on the idea of a Paleozoic 
day, which has had no existence except in the fancy of the writer. This unfortunate 
framework, about which Professor Rogers has clustered his facts, is no serious 
impediment to the geological reader who has a key at hand for comparison. 

The work is a great one, worthy of the State which authorized the survey. It 
contains a vast amount of information in all its departments, and will ever rank 
among the most important of the reports of the geology of the United States.

continued, owing" apparently to an indisposition on

funds. Six volumes of reports had been issued up to 
this time, and by the aid of subsequent special appropriations, two 
more were completed, the last bearing the date 1890, and on the title 
page the name of Joshua Lindahl, State geologist, and Worthen as 
director. The total published resujts of this survey amounted to 
upward of 1,000 pages of text and 197 full-page plates of fossils. 

Worthen was aided at various times during the work by J. D. 
Whitney, Leo Lesquereux, Henry Engelmann, J. S. Newberry. F. B. 
Meek, II. C. Freeman, II. M. Bannister, II. A. Green, James Shaw, 
G. C. Broadhead, Orestes St. John, and E. T. Cox. The work of 
Whitney naturally related to the mining problems of the State, 
Lesquereux to the paleobotany. Meek to the invertebrate paleontol- 
ogy, Newberry to the vertebrate paleontology, and the others men- 
tioned to general stratigraphy. 

In the first volume of his work Worthen divided the sub-Carbon- 
iferous into five groups: The Chester, St. Louis, Keokuk, Burlington, 
and Kinderhook, the term Chester group being used in place of the 
Kaskaskia of Hall, and the St. Louis including the Warsaw of Hall. 
The blue, green, and chocolate-colored shales immediately underlying 
the Kinderhook group in western and southern Illinois he regarded as 
Devonian. 

Whitney, in his report, regarded the Galena limestone as the "sole 
depository of lead in western Illinois/ 1 a view not quite in agreement 
with that expressed with reference to the Iowa and Wisconsin fields. 
Two maps were given in this report — one a geological map of the 
northwest corner of the State, and the other showing a diagram of 
the lead-bearing crevices near Galena. The origin of these lead- 
bearing crevices "seems to be the same cause by which what are called 
joints by geologists have been formed in almost every variety of rock, 
occurring in large homogeneous masses, and especially where a decided 
crystalline texture exists in them." The course of the main set of 
fissures he thought might have been determined by the axis of 
upheaval, by which the whole region had been slowly elevated along 
the north boundary of the district, the metals themselves having been 
held in solution in oceanic waters and precipitated through the agency 
of decomposing organic matter/' 

"This is essentially the view held to-day, with this difference: Most geologists 
believe that the ore was originally disseminated throughout the limestone, and that 
it has become segregated in veins and pockets through the leaching action of 
meteoric waters.

Lesquereux, in connection with his paleobotanical work, took 
occasion to announce his adherence to the view that the coals were the 
result of the accumulation of sphagnous mosses, in place, i. e., were 
not drift. He also introduced a chapter on the origin of prairies, in 
which he took the ground " that all the prairies of the Mississippi 
Valley were formed through the slow recession of sheets of water of 
varying extent, whereby the existing lakes were gradually transformed 
into swamps and bogs and ultimately into dry land. The black sur- 
face soil of the prairies he thought to be due to the growth and decom- 
position of bog vegetation, conferva 1 , etc.-' With this view Worthen, 
in the fifth volume of the reports, did not wholly agree. No one 
theory, he thought, was sufficient to explain all the phenomena noted, 
though the chief cause of the treelessness of the prairies he felt to be 
due to the character of the soil itself. The loess Worthen regarded as 
of fluviatile origin. Concerning the origin of the drift as a whole, he 
wrote: 

Thus it will be seen that the first and greatest of the drift forces was the glacier; 
then the floating iceberg and ice field produced their results, carrying the large 
bowlders from place to place and dropping them over the ice-cold seas; and lastly, 
the wave and current force of water, after the ice had in part or altogether melted, 
leaving the loose clays, sands, and subsoils, substantially as we rind them. 

In his second report, published in 1866, Worthen adhered to the 
determination first published in the Transactions of the Philadelphia 
Academy of Sciences, [865, to call by tin 1 name of the Cincinnati group 
the rocks of the State grouped by Hall under the name of Hudson 
River. This volume was devoted wholly to the paleontology of the 
State, and contained articles by Newberry, Meek, Worthen. and Les- 
quereux. Newberry, in his work on the fossil fishes, accounted for 
the abundance of some of these forms in certain strata as due perhaps 
to the sudden introduction of "heated waters or noxious gases ' , in 
the Carboniferous seas where these forms lived. 

The third volume appeared in 1868, and was given up to a discus- 
sion of the geology of the various counties, with oaleontology by 
Meek and Worthen. 

The fourth volume appeared in 1870. It was devoted quite largely 
to paleobotany by Lesquereux, vertebrate paleontology by Newberry 
and Worthen, and descriptive geology of the various counties by 
Worthen, Bannister, Bradley, and Green. 

Worthen was born in Vermont in 1813, and educated in the com- 
mon schools and the local academy. In 1834 he emigrated to Ken- 
tucky, and in 1836 removed thence to Warsaw, Illinois, where he 
made his permanent home. Until 1855 he was engaged 
sketch of worthen. in mercantile pursuits, but devoted all his spare time 
to a study of the local geology, to which he was at- 
tracted by the abundant fossil remains for which the region was noted.

At the time he begun his work satisfactory text-books were few and 
the difficulties which he encountered in addition may be best under- 
stood when it is remembered that work was undertaken more than 
fifty years ago, when railroads were practically unknown, when post- 
age on a single letter cost 25 cents, and when, moreover, money was 
scarce and labor cheap. There being no overland freight or express 
lines, all his exchanges of specimens with friends in the East were 
made by means of Mississippi River steamboats between Warsaw and 
New Orleans, and Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic sailing vessels between 
New Orleans and Boston. Often months would elapse between the 
time of his sendings and return of exchange material. 

In 1851 Worthen first began attendance 
upon the meetings of the American Associa- 
tion, and in 1853, as noted, took part in the 
survey of the State of Illinois, under the 
direction of J. G. Norwood. From 1855- 
1857 he was assistant to James Hall on the 
survey of Iowa, and in 1858 was made State 
geologist of Illinois in place of Norwood, 
as already mentioned. 

Worthen's own labors related principally 
to the Carboniferous rocks, and to him be- 
longs the credit of being the first to work 
out the true relations of the divisions of the 
Lower Carboniferous system in this section. 
Personally, as we are told by his biogra- 
pher, Worthen was of manly presence, kindly, candid, and of unpre- 
tentious manner, impulsive and generous to his friends, charitable even 
to those with whom he had little sympathy, but uncompromising in his 
love of justice and scientific truth. His thorough interest in his work 
is shown by his persistent continuation of the same under the most 
adverse conditions. Again and again his work was in danger of sus- 
pension by the threatened failure of the necessary appropriations by 
the legislature, and more than once they were so far reduced that 
only the most careful management averted disaster. Once during 
1875-1877 the appropriations were allowed to entirely fail, but he 
continued his work without compensation and with such sincerity of 
purpose that they were resumed by the next legislature. 

Lesquereux, whose paleobotanical work has been on several occasions 
described in these pages, and to whom we shall again have occasion 
to refer, was born at Fleurier, Switzerland, in 1806, and came to 
America with Arnold Guyot, about 1848. His early scientific studies 
were on living plants; but later, and particularly after coming to 
America, he turned his attention almost exclusively to fossil forms. 
His work on the coal plants of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and

Sketch of 
Lesquereux 




Arkansas began in 1850, and his papers appear in the geological sur- 
vey reports of all these States. His work on the coal flora of Penn- 
sylvania was particularly valuable, forming what was 
at the time the most important work on Carboniferous 
plants published in America. Lesquereux became early 
connected with the Hay den surveys, and to 
the time of his death, in 1889, was actively 
engaged in the study of the materials col- 
lected by members of this organization. 
Deaf from early manhood, a foreigner, 
with but poor command of English, he 
labored under enormous disadvantages. 
To an interviewer he once remarked: 

The science student's life is absorbed with grave 
ami serious truths; they are naturally serious men. 
My associations have been almost entirely of a 
scientific nature. My deafness cut me off from 
everything that lay outside of science. I have 
lived with nature, the rocks, the trees, the flowers. 
They know me. I know them. All outside are 
dead to me. 

In April. 1858, Henry Youle Hind, of Toronto, was authorized by 

the provincial government of Canada to explore the region "lying to 

the west of Lake Winnipeg and Red River, and embraced (or nearly 

so) between the rivers Saskatchewan and Assiniboine, as far west as 

South Branch House on the former river." He was directed further 

to procure all the information in his power respect- 
Hind's work in the ' L ' 
Winnipeg Country, uig the geology, natural history, topography, and 

meteorology of the region. The work was accom- 
plished between June 14 and October 31, the results being published 
in 1859 in form of a thin quarto volume of 201 pages, with a colored 
geological map, two plates of fossils, and other maps, figures, and sec- 
tions. The region was described as occupied by Laurentian gneisses 
to the east of Lake Winnipeg, succeeded to the west by Silurian, 
Devonian, and Cretaceous formations. The Cretaceous fossils were 
described by F. B. Meek and the Devonian and Silurian forms by 
E. Billings. 

Hall's principal contribution to strictly physical geology was that 
relating to the accumulation of sediments and the formation of moun- 
tain chains. The first brief announcement of this was made in his 
Hairs views on reports on the geology of Iowa, (p. 165). In 1857 he 
M e ountain a BuUd & ini brought the matter before the public once more in his 
1859 - address before the American Association for the 

Advancement of Science, at Montreal. This address was, however, 
not printed at the time, and it was not until two years later that he 



500 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

formulated his views and gave them in extension in part six of the 
third volume of the Natural History of New York. In 1869, in an 
address on the Geological History of the North American Continent, 
delivered before the American Institute of New York, he reiterated 
many of the opinions previously announced, and, finally,, in 1882 
brought out the original address of 1857, and this, it is said, without 
revision. Whatever changes or additions it was found desirable to 
make were added in the form of supplementary notes. The subject 
may. therefore, be conveniently reviewed at this date (1859). 

Hall had shown that one simple and intelligible sequence of strata, 
from the Potsdam sandstone to the end of the Coal Measures, covered, 
with slight exceptions, the entire country from the Atlantic slopes, to 
the base of the Rocky Mountains, and that while the horizontal strata 
gave their whole elevation to the highest parts of the plain, the same 
beds were folded and contorted in the mountain region, thus giving to 
the mountain elevation not one-sixth of their actual thickness. He 
thought to have shown conclusively that the line of greatest accumu- 
lation of sediments had been along the direction of the Appalachian 
chain; in other words, that the Appalachian chain was itself due to 
the original deposition of materials and not to any subsequent action 
or influence breaking up and dislocating the strata of which it was 
composed. 

Discussing the cause of this folding and plication, he referred to the 
tact previously recognized by Herschel to the effect that sea bottoms, 
when loaded by accumulated sediments, undergo a process of subsi- 
dence which may cause an elevation of the adjacent continental areas. 
a principle which was then becoming generalh" recognized and which 
lias since become known under the name of isostacy. When, then, these 
sediments were spread along a belt of sea bottom, as originally in the 
line of the present Appalachian chain, the first effect would be to pro- 
duce a yielding of the earth's crust beneath and a gradual subsidence. 
Evidence of this subsidence was furnished by the great amount of 
material accumulated, for it was impossible, he argued, to suppose 
that the sea had been originally as deep as the thickness of the accu- 
mulations (some 40,000 feet). 

The line of greatest depression would, therefore, be along the lines 
of greatest accumulation. By such a process of subsidence the lower 
side of the accumulations would become gradually curved and stretched, 
and there would follow, as a sequence, rents and fractures. On the 
surface above, which would be contracted horizontally by such sub- 
sidence, there would be produced wrinkles and foldings of the strata. 
Into the rifts formed below it was conceivable there might rush fluid 
or semifluid material, producing what are now evident as trap dikes. 

The sinking of the mass would produce a great synclinal axis, and 
within this axis, whether on a large or small scale, would be produced 



AMKKKAN GEOLOGY — -DECADE OF 1850-185.9. 501 

numerous .smaller synclinal and anticlinal axes. The greater amount 
of compression above or stretching below along the line of maximum 
thickness of the sediments would account for the gradual decline 
toward the margin of the major syncline or the evidences of fracture 
and distortion. This, he thought, afforded a partial explanation of 
the fact that mountain elevations in disturbed regions bear, in their 
altitude, a much smaller proportion to the actual thickness of the for- 
mation than do the hills in undisturbed regions; and, further, that since 
in the formation of an anticline the beds are weakest at the ridge and 
become more liable to denudation, such arc often worn down to form 
low ground or even deep valleys, while the synclinal arches, being 
protected in the downward curvings of the beds, may remain to form 
the prominent mountain crests, as is observable in the southern Appa- 
lachians. It now here seemed to him that folding or plication had con- 
tributed to the altitude of the mountains, but rather that the more 
extreme the plication the greater had been the general degradation of 
the mass wherever subjected to denuding agencies. 

The chief elevation of the Appalachian chain, he argued, was conti- 
nental and not of local origin, and the present mountain barriers to 
him were but the visible evidences of the deposits upon an ancient 
ocean bed, while the determining cause of their elevation existed long- 
anterior to the production of the mountains themselves. 

At no point nor along any line between the Appalachian and Rocky Mountains 
could the same forces have produced a mountain chain, because the materials of 
accumulation were insufficient, and though we may trace what appears to be the 
gradual subsiding influences of these forces, it is simply in these instances due to the 
paucity of the material upon which to exhibit its effects. 

Referring to the amount of metamorphism which these rocks had 
undergone, Hall thought that we must look to some other agency than 
heat for the production of the phenomena, and that the "prime cause 
must have existed within the material itself; that the entire change 
was due to motion or fermentation and pressure aided by a moderate 
increase of temperature, producing chemical change." Just what is 
meant by this it is difficult to say, but, inasmuch as Hall seems to have 
been in consultation with Sterry Hunt, it is safe to assume that it was 
intended to include all possible causes which future investigation 
might show to have been operative. 

These views of Hall seem not to have been favorably received at 
first by the American geologists, and were facetiously referred to 
by Dana as proposing a system of mountain making with mountains 
left out. To this Hall very justly replied that he had not intended 
to offer any new theory of elevation, nor to propound any principle 
as involved beyond what had been suggested by Babbage and Herschel. 
What he did intend to imply was that mountain elevation was due 
to sedimentary accumulation and subsequent continental elevation. 



502 



REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



Hunt, coming to Hall's assistance, argued that bis views were largely 
in harmony with those previously maintained by masters in the 
science of geology, de Montlosier, as early as L832, having declared 
that the great mountain chains of Europe were but the remains of 
continental elevations which had been cut away by denudation, the 
foldings and inversions in the structure of mountains being looked 
upon as local and accidental. 

Joseph Le Conte, in a later paper, was inclined to criticise Hall's 
theory as insufficient, but a statement of his views, as well as those of 
Dana, may be left to their proper place in chronological succession. 

In L859 Henry Engelmann accompanied, 
as geologist, an expedition commanded by 
(apt. J. II. Simpson, organized for the 
purpose of opening new wagon routes for 
military purposes across the Great Basin 
of Utah. Engelmann's report, accom- 
panied by one of Meek's on 
PnTta m hTs5Q W ° rk the invertebrate fossils, 
formed Appendixes I and 
K of the general report of the expedition. 
Originally, as it would appear from the 
text, the manuscript was accompanied by a 
geological map and profile, though such do 
not seem to have been published. No 
explanation is offered, but it is probable 
that developments during the long interval up to time of publica- 
tion" were such as to make the map of doubtful value, and it 
was suppressed. Engelmann's observations began with the country 
in the immediate vicinity of Leavenworth. He noted the presence of 
rocks of Carboniferous and Permo-Carboniferous ages along the 
Republican River, and of Cretaceous and Tertiary deposits farther 
west. In the district leading from the eastern foothills of the Rocky 
Mountains to the divide between the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific 
he thought to recognize rocks of Silurian and probably Devonian, Car- 
boniferous, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary ages.

CHAPTER VI. 

THE ERA OF STATE SURVEYS, FOURTH DECADE, 1860-1869. 

The period of the civil war might naturally be expected to be a 
period of uncertainty and inaction in matters relating- to the sciences. 

In all the seceding States work then in progress was brought 
abruptly to a close, and in several of them — as Missouri, North Caro- 
lina, and Texas— the records so far lost or ruined through neglect as 
to make them well-nigh valueless for future reference. Throughout 
the North the results were comparatively less disastrous, though even 
there work was in some instances temporarily discontinued, owing to 
the failure of legislatures to make the necessary appropriations. In 
four instances, however (Calif ornia, Indiana, Maine, and New Jersey), 
surveys were established almost in the midst of the threatened disaster. 

With the passing of these years of turmoil, active work was begun 
once more in States where it had been but temporarily suspended, and 
in others, new organizations authorized, as in Kansas in 1864, Iowa 
and North Carolina in 1S66, and Louisiana, Michigan, and Ohio in 
llS(i9. A futile and ill-considered attempt at a State survey of Nevada 
was also made in 1866 ((). but, fortunately for the reputation both of 
the science and the individual, no one was found to undertake the 
work under the conditions proposed." W. E. Logan continued his 
work as provincial geologist of Canada, and Murray and Richardson 
were employed in Newfoundland. 

The literature of the decade was scarcely as voluminous as in either 
the preceding or the one following. By far the most important, when 
all is taken into consideration, was the first edition of Dana's Manual 
of Geology — a work of 798 pages, which at once took its place as the 
leading authority on all matters pertaining to American Geology — a 
place which it has continued to hold through all its four editions down 
to the present. In addition to this may be mentioned Logan's sum- 
mation of the geology of Canada (1863) and Cooke's New Jersey (1868). 

This was largely an era of new workers, or, at least, new leaders. 
Eaton was gone; D. D. Owen died at its very beginning; the elder 
Hitchcock had largely ceased his labors; while the Rogers brothers had 
both become absorbed in the work of teaching and administration, and 
no longer took an active part. Dana was undoubtedly the leading 

« The sum of $6,000 is stated to have been appropriated, with the stipulation that 
the survey be completed in eight months. 

503 



504 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM,' 1904. 

figure, while James Hall, by sheer physical energy, dominated in mat- 
ters paleontological. Many new names and faces appear. Among 
them may be mentioned those of T. B. Brooks, E. Billings, Robert 
Bell, E. T. Cox, E. D. Cope, F. V. Hayden, C. H. Hitchcock, W. C. 
Kerr, W. E. Logan, Alexander Murray, J. G. Norwood, Edward 
Orton, R. Pumpelly, C. Rominger, N. S. Shaler, C. A. White, and 
Charles Whittlesey. 

As a whole, the decade was one of extension of the geographic 
boundaries of knowledge rather than one of discovery or announce- 
ment of new principles. Of all subjects, that of glaeiation received, 
perhaps, the most attention. Our line of separation between this and 
the decade to follow must be quite arbitrary, since several important 
surveys were organized during 1869 and continued well on into the 
seventies. 

At the very beginning of this era there appeared R. Thomassy's 

Geologie Pratique de la Louisiane, a small quarto volume of 263 

pages, with 6 plates. Why the word "pratique'" should have been 

introduced into the title it is hard to sav, a large pro- 

R. Thomassy's . . . J ' , . ,

and meteorological or physiographical matters, and the 
really geological portion limited to a description and discussion of the 
lower Mississippi, its delta, and attendant phenomena. Its appearance 
seems to have excited little interest, not being even noted in the 
American Journal of Science, and the few original ideas advanced are 
referred to by Hilgard and other subsequent writers only to show 
their erroneous nature. 

Thomassy dwelt in considerable detail upon the absorption of the 
waters of the Mississippi by the porous terranes above New Orleans 
and their consequent diminution in volume seaward. The "mud 
lumps," so common in the lower reaches of the river, he regarded as 
due to mud springs, having their source at a somewhat higher level 
on the land and opening upward in the bed of the stream. 

He considered North Island, or Petite Anse, as it is more commonly 
known, as of volcanic origin, and thought to have discovered traces 
of the violent corrosive action of thermal waters and acids on the rock 
fragments which he conceived to have been ejected from the depths 
of the Gulf through explosive action. Richard Owen, it may be men- 
tioned, while serving in the • Federal Army and stationed at New 
Iberia, Louisiana, studied these deposits cursorily, and came to the 
conclusion that the island was not volcanic. On the contrary, he 
thought the salt was the product of evaporation of modern sea water, 
forming lagoons behind protecting ridges under the influence of occa- 
sional high tides. (See also HilgaixTs views, p. 561.) 

In 1859, largely through the efforts of Alexander Wiuchell, then 
professor of physics and civil engineering in the State University,,

there was established a geological survey of Michigan. Of this Win- 
chell was appointed director, making his first Report 

Winchells Work in „ _ ll . „ n J° . ^ 

Michigan, 1859- of Progress — an octavo volume or 339 pages — in 1861. 
In this report he called attention to the futility of 
efforts then being made to produce salt in the vicinity of Grand 
Rapids, and fully anticipated the development of the same industry in 
the Saginaw V alley, his explorations enabling him to locate the salt 
beds at a depth of 650 feet. Attention was given, also, to the occur- 
rence of gypsum, coal, iron, and other economic products and to the 
geographical distribution of rocks belonging to the various formations 
throughout the State. 

The so-called Marshall sandstone (Lower Carboniferous) he regarded 
on paleontological grounds as lying above the Hamilton group. lie 
found evidence which led him to conclude that the Ohio and Michigan 
coal basins were never continuous, as had been heretofore asserted, 
and, indeed, that the geological column in the latter State had been 
built up quite distinct and independently from that in adjacent 
regions. He could find no parallelism between the Carboniferous 
limestones and those lying farther to the west, and all the evidence 
indicated to him that these deposits were laid down in an isolated 
basin cut off from that of Ohio to the south throughout the entire 
period from the Helderberg to that of the drift. In consequence of 
the outbreak of the civil war no appropriations were made for the 
continuation of the survey after 1861. 

Winchell was born in the town of Northeast, Dutchess County, New r 
York, in 1821. and graduated at Wesleyan University, Middletown, 
Connecticut, in 1817. His scientific tendencies are said to have mani- 
fested themselves at a very early age, although he 
sketch of wincheii. showed no marked preference for any branch of study, 
unless it was toward mathematics, in which pursuit he 
seems to have been little shortof precocious. Immediately after grad- 
uating he entered upon a career of teaching and lecturing, which kept 
him prominently before the public for over forty years. 

His first public geological lectures were given at Pennington Semi- 
nary in 1849. In 1850 he assumed charge of an academy at Newbern, 
Alabama, but finding the conditions were not what he had been led to 
expect, he resigned, and in the spring of 1851 opened the Mesopota- 
mia Female Seminary at Eutaw, in the same State. Finding, however, 
that he was illy adapted to the successful management of a Southern 
female institution, he gave up this position to accept the presidency of 
the Masonic University at Selraa, Alabama. While engaged in the 
work of presenting the claims of this university before the people in 
the southern part of the State, he made extensive geological tours 
throughout the region and brought together large collections in natural 
history. In November, 1853, he was elected to the chair of physics 



506 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

and civil engineering in the University of Michigan, at Ann Arbor, and 
entered upon his duties in January, 1854. 

In 1859 he was commissioned by Governor Moses Wisner, of Mich- 
igan, as State geologist, as above noted, holding the position for two 
years, when the survey was abolished through failure on the part of 
the legislature to make proper provisions for its continuance. He 
issued while holding this office one Report of Progress, an octavo vol- 
ume of 339 pages, published in August, 1861. In 1869 the survey was 
reorganized and Winchell again appointed director, he assuming for 
himself the personal investigation of the lower peninsula. His report, 
a small octavo volume of 64 pages, appeared in 1871, the previous 
report on the Grand Traverse region, a work of 97 octavo pages, hav- 
ing appeared in 1866. 

Owing to hostility over the management of the survey, which had 
been aroused in the legislature by personal enemies of Winchell. it 
appeared likely that the appropriations for carrying on the survey 
would fail. Hence he resigned the position in 1871. 

In 1873 Winchell resigned also his professorship at the University 
of Michigan, accepting the position of chancellor of Syracuse Univer- 
sity, which he held, however, only until June, 1875. In this latter 
year he was offered the professorship of geology, zoology, and botany 
in Vanderbilt University, at Nashville, Tennessee, but did not see fit 
to accept, although he did subsequently till a three months' engage- 
ment there. In May, 1878, he took tinal leave of the university, and the 
chair was abolished, owing to some foolish differences of opinion that 
had arisen between himself and Bishop McTyeire, who took exception 
to Winchell's stand in reference to pre- Adamites and evolution. 

In June, 1879, Winchell was again called to Ann Arbor, being 
offered the chair of geolog} 7 and paleontology in the State University. 
This position he accepted and continued to hold until the time of his 
death. In March, 1887, he was offered the position of State geologist 
of Arkansas, but refused. 

Winchell's work as a geologist, as may be readily imagined from 
this sketch, was of a more or less fragmentary nature, and it is as a 
teacher, public lecturer, and writer on scientific subjects that he is 
best known. The advanced stand which he took regarding evolution 
brought him in conflict with the religious element, particularly at 
Vanderbilt University, as already referred to. 

Winchell was for a time connected with the Minnesota geological 
survey. He was one of the original promoters of the American 
Geologist and the Geological Society of America. As stated by his 
biographer: 

His largest educational field, however, was the public platform. Here he was 
under no constraint by reason of youthful auditors. No limits were set to his rhap- 
sodic scientific eloquence; no courteous regard for the amenities of possible profes-

sorial etiquette hampered the free flow of his criticism, or the exultant prophecy of 
the betterments of the future. * * * Himself a working geologist in the field, 
he was well acquainted with geological methods. A teaching geologist in the uni- 
versity, lie was skillful in imparting his own knowledge and in training others to 
habits <>f observation and investigation. 

As a writer of books Winchell will be remembered for his Sketches 
of Creation, L870; the Doctrine of Evolution. 1*74; Pre- Adamites, 
L880; Sparks from a Geologist's Hammer. 1881; World Life, 1S83, 
and his text-book. Elements of Geology, L886. Of these his work on 
World Life is undoubtedly the one showing the greatest amount of 
research and thought, and was at that time probably the only one in 
the English language covering in a systematic manner the entire field 
of world history. 

In 1859 D. IX Owen had, for the second time, accepted an appoint- 
ment as State geologist of Indiana, but with the stipulation that, until 
his surveys in Arkansas and Kentucky, upon which he was then engaged, 
were completed, most of the held work should be per-

Doctor Owen s death in L8o0, the work tell wholly upon 
the brother, who succeeded him in the office of State geologist. 

The results of the survey are comprised in an octavo volume of 364 
pages, issued in 1862. Like other of this author's writings, it is prolix 
and uninteresting, differing in this respect in a marked degree from 
those of David Dale. 

The importance of fossils was recognized, and it was set down as an 
"unquestioned truth that a certain vertical range or ascertained thick- 
ness of fossiliferous rock is characterized by the organic remains of 
plants and animals, differing more or less from the plants and animals in 
the rocks above as well as those in the rocks below the given la} T ers or 
strata/' The rocks of the State were all classified under: (1) Lower 
Silurian; (2) Upper Silurian; (3) Devonian; (1) Subcarboniferous; 
(5) Coal Measures, and (6) the Drift or Quaternary. Some 25 pages 
were given up to soil analyses by Robert Peter, and 70 to a report on 
the Distribution of the Geological Strata in the Coal Measures of the 
State, by Leo Lesquereux 

No maps or sections accompanied the report, which, as a whole, is 
singularly lacking in interesting or instructive matter. -I. Lesley 
served as topographer. 

With the outbreak of the civil war Owen resigned to take command 
of a company of volunteers, and this, the third attempt at a geological 
survey of Indiana, came to an end. 

Prevailing ideas regarding conditions of sedimentation have been fre- 
quently referred to in these pages, but with more particular reference to 
the position of the sea floor — whether inclined or horizontal — upon which 
the sedimentary beds were deposited. A new phase of the question 
was brought to light during a discussion between W. B. Rogers and 



508 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904, 

Louis Agassiz at the meeting of the Boston Society of Natural History, 
March 21, 1860. 

Rogers argued that the strata between Lake Ontario and the Penn- 
sylvania coal region were deposited on gradually subsiding sea bot- 
,„ . toins. On this supposition only could he account for 

Ideas ot Rogers and r r .'

on a gradually rising sea bottom, the older deposits would crop out 
at the higher levels and the successively later ones at lower levels. 
Agassiz, on the other hand, maintained that there was no subsidence 
during the deposition of the New York strata, and that the facts indi- 
cated just the reverse, i. e., an upheaval. During the upheaval, he 
argued, the level of the sea might be actually less, from the contraction 
of the earth while cooling, but in consequence of this contraction the 
ocean would always remain at a certain depth, sufficient for the depo- 
sition of the thousands of feet of strata. The study of the fossils he 
argued was also opposed to the theory of subsidence and denudation, 
since those of the Primary were never found carried into the Secondary 
beds. 

At the April 4 meeting the discussion was resumed, when Rogers 
took the ground that an assumption of an upward movement of the sea 
bottom carried with it the admission of an original depth so enormous 
as to be incompatible with the accumulation of the material of the 
earlier strata, unless, indeed, the strata were supposed to be formed 
exclusively within a moderate distance of the shore. 

We might imagine a series of strata to be successively laid down in a gentle slope 
approximately parallel to that of the ancient sea bottom, each terminating against 
this surface without being continued into the profounder depths beyond, and we 
might suppose the floor to be rising in the region of this accumulation at such a rate 
as to bring successive tracts, farther and farther from the ancient shore line, within 
limits of depth admitting of mechanical and orgauic deposition; but in such circum- 
stances of formation these earlier strata, instead of extending, as they are believed to 
do, almost continuously over the whole ocean floor, would be seen to determinate at 
no great distance from the original shore line, but abutting against the bottom at the 
places where the depth had set a limit to their accumulation. 

No hypothesis of a secular rising of the sea bottom, he therefore 
argued, could explain the formation of the Appalachian Paleozoic 
deposit. They indicated, rather, a long period of subsidence of the 
ocean floor, varied by many and long pauses of upward oscillations. 

Agassiz, in reply, admitted the probable shallowness of the ocean in 
which the strata Mere deposited, and that during a local upheaval of 
the shore, the whole sea bottom was probably subsiding, the subsidence 
being due to shrinkage, caused by the cooling of the earth's crust. 
This view was accepted by Rogers as amounting to a virtual disclaim- 
ing of the theory as advanced. 

The removal of B. F. Shumard as State geologist of Texas in 1860, 
as noted on page 4S7, was immediately followed by the appointment of

his successor, Dr. Francis Moore, '*an honorable and cultured gentle- 
man of much executive ability." a one-time newspaper 

Work of Moore and ,. . " . . 

Buckley in Texas, editor, but, so tar as can be learned, never a geologist. 
In April. 1861, the survey was. however, suspended 
by an act of the legislature, and both Shnmard and Moore requested 
to report on what had been accomplished. With this request neither 
party complied. Shumard going immediately to St. Louis, where he 
died in 1869, and Doctor Moore leaving for the north on the outbreak 
of the civil war, where he, too. died in 18b4. 

The notes of these short-lived organizations seem to have, in part 
at least, passed into the hands of S. B. Buckley, a botanical collector 
under the Shumard regime, who returned to Austin after the close of 
the war and succeeded in having himself appointed State geologist. 
In this capacity he issued one report, bearing date of 1866, and com- 
prising some 80 octavo pages, dealing with generalities and matters 
pertaining to the agricultural resources of the State, but containing 
little or nothing of geological value and but few references to what 
had been done by his predecessors. Buckley's period of rule was short, 
coining to an end in 1867. 

No attempt at resuscitation was made until 1S7<>. when the governor, 
under authority from the legislature, appointed John W. Glenn Stslte 
geologist. Glenn, however, found the position uncongenial and 
j. w. Glenn resigned the following year, to be -succeeded in 1*74 

G^i S e t d ofTexas, h >~ Buckley once more. The latter held the office but 
l870- two years, when the governor, becoming convinced 

(truthfully, it is to be feared) that the survey promised to be of no 
practical benefit to the State, vetoed the bill appropriating moneys 
for its continuation. 

During this second term of office Buckley issued two reports, under 
dates of 1874 and 1876, respectively, comprising altogether some 220 
pages. The first contained a brief history of the past surveys of the 
State and a somewhat partisan account of an unhappy disagreement

Houston had not even intimated to me that he intended my removal. So far as I

which existed between Shumard and himself. Both the statements 
made and the manner in which they are presented are such as to prej- 
udice the unbiased reader against Mr. Buckley, and this in particular 
when one reflects that there was no apparent occasion for the publica- 
tion in an official report of matters of this nature. Buckley was 
replied to vigorously by A. R. Roessler, who had also been one of 
Shumard's assistan ts. 

The main portion of both reports was given up to a discussion of 
economic problems, and little that was new geologically appeared. 
He noted the eruptive nature of Pilot Knob, but was unable to deter- 
mine whether the period of eruption antedated the Cretaceous or not. 
Much space was devoted to a discussion of soils and crops, together 
with notes on the fauna and flora. 

In his report on the geology of Massachusetts (1833), and again in 
1835 and 1841, Dr. Edward Hitchcock called attention to the flattening 
and distortion of pebbles in a conglomerate near Newport, Rhode Island, 
„.. . . , .,. as already noted. As time went on the importance 

Hitchcock sViewson - r 

of c^n et iomerati| m °^ tne sll bject, particularly in the light of subsequent 
1861 • discoveries, seems to have grown upon him, and in a 

paper in the American Journal of Science for 1861, and in his reports 
on the geology of Vermont for that same year, the ground is gone over 
in great detail and his gradually expanding views fully elaborated. 

In his report of 1833 the conglomerates were described as composed 
of elongated rounded nodules of quartz rock passing into mica slate, 
with a cement of talcose slate, all with their longest diameters uni- 
formly parallel, the entire mass, pebbles and all, being divided by 
fissures as perfect as if "cut through by the sword of some Titan."'' 
Later, while engaged in the work of the Vermont survey, he found 
analogous conglomerates along nearly the whole western side of the 
Green Mountains, and in 1859, in company with his son, C. H. Hitch- 
cock, he again visited the Newport locality in search of facts to aid 
him in solving the Vermont problem. His results were given before 
the American Association for the Advancement of Science that same 
year, and the subject again brought before the Association by C. H. 
Hitchcock in 18(50. 

The facts brought out and presented showed the pebbles to be (1) 
much elongated in the direction of the strike of the beds; (2) that, 
while flattened, this feature was not so striking as their elongation; 

(3) that they were often indented by one being pressed into another; 

(4) that they were often bent, sometimes in two directions; and (5) 
that they were cut across by parallel joints, or Assures, at intervals 
of from a few inches to many feet. These facts led him to conclude 
that (1) the rock had once been a conglomerate of the usual character, 
and had undergone a metamorphosis wherebv the cementing material 
had become crystalline and schistose and the pebbles elongated, and 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 18(50-1869. 



511 



(2) the pebbles themselves had been in a more or less plastic state; 
otherwise any attempt at change in form would result only in frac- 
ture and comminution. The clean manner in which the pebbles were 
cut by joints was thought also to indicate a condition of plasticity. 
The flattening and distorting force was thought to have operated later- 
ally, and the jointing regarded as due to some polarizing force acting 
upon soft materials, a simple inspection of the rock in place being suf- 
ficient to satisfy anyone that no mechanical agency would alone be 
sufficient to produce the phenomena. Appl} T ing the same method of 
reasoning to the conglomerates of Vermont, he came to the conclusion 
that these, too, had undergone metamorphism, giving rise to schists 
and gneiss, and that, indeed, granites and syenites might result from 
the metamorphism of stratified rocks. The chemical details as worked 
out would naturally not hold in their entirety to-day, and of course 
the idea of a polarizing force would be no longer seriously considered; 
but the fact remains that this paper, as a 
whole, marks a long stride in advance along 
the line of metamorphism, and for its time 
was comparable in its importance with the 
later work of Lehmann on the crystalline 
schists of Saxony." 

B}' an act of the legislature approved 
March 1(5, 1861, Eze'kiel Holmes, of Win- 
throp, Maine, was commissioned, under the 
direction of the board of agriculture, to 
make a scientific survey of 
the State. C. II. Hitch- 
cock, then of Amherst, Mas- 
sachusetts, and a son of Dr. Edward Hitch- 
cock, was commissioned geologist, while 
George L. Goodale served as botanist and chemist, C. Houghton as 
mineralogist, A. S. Packard, jr., as entomologist, and C. B. Fuller 
as marine zoologist. Others, including G. L. Vose and Dr. N. T. True, 
rendered assistance at various times. 

Two brief seasons were devoted to Held work, the results of which 
appeared in the reports of the board of agriculture for 18(31-62, the 
strictly geological portions being limited to some six hundred and odd 
pages. The work done under these conditions was necessarily some- 
what disconnected. Northern Maine was still practically a wilderness; 

« The subject was in 1868 again taken up by Prof. G. L. Vose, whose conclusions, 
based on a study of congiomerates in the vicinity of the Raugeley Lakes, were largely 
confirmatory of those of the Hitehcocks. He was not, however, disposed to regard 
the pebbles as having been in a plastic state, hut contended that under the forces 
that had there prevailed rigid pebbles might be bent and flattened in the manner 
described.

there were no maps and absolutely no railroads. A geological map in 
black and white was, however, prepared of the region north of Calais 
and the 45th parallel, and also one of the eastern portion of the State 
included between St. George and Belfast. 

The fossiliferous rocks were noted as mostly Paleozoic and probably 
all lying below the Carboniferous series. The red sandstone of Perry, 
the problematic horizon of which had been discussed by Jackson and 
others, as previously noted in these pages, was regarded as u indis- 
putably Devonian," this statement being based upon expressed opin- 
ions of Jackson, Rogers, Newberry, and Dawson. It was noted that 
the fossiliferous marine clays, which were regarded as of the same age 
as the similar deposits along the St. Lawrence and the Champlain val- 
leys and referable to the Terrace period, sometimes underlay a coarse 
deposit referable to the unmodihed drift. Without committing him- 
self definitely on this point, Hitchcock suggested the possibility, there- 
fore, of a recurrence of the drift agencies — that is, a period of second 
drift. This, so far as the present writer has information, is the first 
suggestion by an American of such a possibility. It seems, however, 
to have been quite lost sight of. (See also remarks of Edward Hitch- 
cock, p. 462.) 

The drift period itself, according to Hitchcock's view, was inaugu- 
rated by depression of this portion of the continent amounting to at 
least 5,00(1 feet below that of to-day. Subsequently the continent rose 
again gradually to its present altitude. It was during this period of 
depression and elevation that the drift deposits were formed through 
the conjoined agency of icebergs and glaciers. The various forms of 
modified drift he thought to have been produced largely by the aid of 
rivers and moving currents of water. These views were those very 
generally held at that date, though, naturally, they have been some- 
what modified since. 

The quartz rock in the vicinity of Rockland, Thomaston, and Cam- 
den was regarded as belonging to the Taconic period of Emmons, and 
the associated limestones were looked upon as contemporaneous with 
the Stockbridge limestones of Emmons or, what is the same thing, the 
^Eolian limestones of the elder Hitchcock. 

Dr. J. S. Newberry, in Notes on the Surface Geology of the Basin 
of the Great Lakes, after a review of the surface conditions as he saw 
them, came to the conclusion that at a period corresponding in cli- 
mate, if not in time, with the Glacial epoch of the Old 
N Jf^ ry * s « ie ^-> World, the lake region in common with all the north- 

on Cilaciation, 1862. » 

ern portion of the American Continent was raised 
.several thousand feet above the level of the sea. This was the "gla- 
cial period," during which the surface of the country was planed 
down and the deep fiords along the Atlantic coast formed. This was 
followed by a period of depression, when all the basin of the Great 



AMERICAN" GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1860-1869. 513 

Lakes was flooded with fresh water, forming- a vast inland sea, in 
which the laminated blue clays, the "oldest of our drift deposits," 
were precipitated. Subsequent to this deposit of blue clays "an 
immense quantity of gravel and bowlders was transported from the 
region north of the Great Lakes and scattered oyer a wide area south of 
them." This was due to floating ice and icebergs. The lake ridges 
(ancient beaches), described by Whittlesey, Newberry regarded as 
evidence that the Avater of the lakes remained for considerable inter- 
vals much higher than at present. These are practically the same 
views announced before the New York Lyceum in 1870 (p. r>15). 

In May, 1862, J. P. Lesley read a paper before the American Philo- 
sophical Society describing the structure of the Allegheny Mountains, 
in which he assumed that the rocks of the Blue Ridge Range, on the 
eastern side of the valley, were a prolongation of the 
struauTe^S 3 ' 11 Green Mountains of Vermont, and consisted, theref ore. 
of the Quebec group, or Taconic System. In this he 
followed the Rogers Brothers, as he acknowledged. He accounted 
for the change in the drainage, as exhibited by the New River, which 
breaks into the Appalachians, as due to a structural change in the 
geology, most of the mountain valleys north of this being unbroken 
anticlines and synclines, while most of those south of it are monoclines 
bounded by immense faults or downthrows. The Appalachians of 
southern Virginia and eastern Tennessee are grouped in pairs by faults, 
the fracturing being in parallel strips from 5 to 6 miles wide, each 
strip being tilted easterly so that the upper edge of one strip, with its 
Carboniferous rocks, abuts against the bottom or Lower Silurian edge 
of the strip next to it. The Paleozoic zone, therefore, included 
between the Great Valley and the backbone escarpment, is occupied 
by as many pairs of parallel mountains as there are parallel faults, and 
as these faults lie in straight lines at nearly equal distances from one 
another the mountain ranges run with great uniformity side by side 
for 100 or 200 miles until cut off by cross faults, or by change in the 
courses of the principal faults. 

In a paper before the American Philosophical Societ}^ the year fol- 
lowing on a "remarkable coal mine or asphalt vein in 
ind'eVolion, ^ 1 ." 1 the CoaI Measures of Wood County, (West) Virginia," 
Lesley was led into a discussion of uplift and erosion, 
and expressed sundiy ideas Avorth} r of note. 

Assuming that the valley cutting through this mine was one of ero- 
sion and had been carved out since the vein was filled, Lesley speculated 
on the time and causes of erosion and incidentally on the character of 
the original uplift. He rejected the idea of cataclysmic erosion dating 
back to the time of the uplift, as he did also that of the secularists, 
who regard the present face of the country as but the latest phase of 

NAT MUS 1904 33 



514 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

an infinite series of oceanic degradations, beginning with the uplift and 
still in progress. Instead, he adopted the supposition of a succession 
of denuding actions of unknown force and indefinite number. "A 
homogeneous element with sufficient force, acting either by one or by 
repeated blows," would bring about the present condition of affairs. 

No one will deny that water, if obtained in sufficient quantity at a sufficient veloc- 
ity, would be such an agent. In the acknowledged instability of the crust of the 
earth, in its acknowledged less stability in ancient times than now, we find the pos- 
sibility, nay, we feel the certainty, that the oceans have at times been launched 
across the continents, and we need nothing more to satisfy all the conditions for an 
explanation of Appalachian topography. 

One great obstacle, Lesley thought, in the way of topographical 
science among geologists — 

has been an innocent ignorance of the titanic postulates upon the ground, and there- 
fore an inability to reconstruct in imagination the awful vaults of rock which have 
been removed from over at least 50,000 square miles of the surface of the United 
States merely along the one belt of the Appalachian Mountains, between the coal 
area and the Blue Ridge range. 

However this may have been, Lesley himself could not be accused 
of any such innocent ignorance and consequent impotency of imagina- 
tion. Thus, when speculating on the character of the folds of the 
Appalachians, as controlled by the roughness of the old surface of the 
more or less disturbed and eroded sedimentaries and the thinness of 
the newer formations, whereby there was a tendency for more or less 
hitch and catch below and crack and shove above, he showed that such 
features were here reduced to a minimum, and hence probably the high 
anticlines were unbroken at the crest. 

As a whole, the plicating energy must have acted with a steady evenness of thrust, 
which carried up the anticlinal waves of the crust unbroken, and in some cases to a 
height of between 5 and 10 miles above the present surface level. 

Truly a strange admixture of views. As a modern catastrophist he 
was equaled only by Clarence King. 

It was the opinion of Rogers, it will be remembered, that the great 
amount of erosion which had manifestly taken place in the Pennsyl- 
vania Appalachians was cataclysmic, the consequence of a great rush 
of waters or body of water over the face of the continent at the time 
when the coal era was about to be terminated by the upheaval of the 
whole Appalachian belt of earth crust, when it was thrown into waves 
or folds. Lesley at first accepted this view and even as late as 1864 
confessed himself as not entirely convinced that such a cataclysm was 
not necessary in order "to explain the earlier and perhaps the larger 
part of the whole phenomenon." He did not, however, accept Rogers's 
"pulsating planetary lava-nucleus" theory to account for the primary 
origin of the range, but felt that the force of lateral thrust caused by 
shrinkage from a cooling globe better accounted for the surface convo- 
lutions as he saw them.

AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1860-1869. 515 

In 1860 J. D. Whitney was appointed State geologist of California 

and served until 1874, when the survey was discontinued. According 

to the original act, he was required to make an accurate and complete 

geological survey of the State and to furnish a report 

Whitney's Geological to ? . J . l 

Survey of California, containing a tul I scientific description ot its rocks, fos- 
sils, soils, and minerals, and of its botanical and zoo- 
logical productions. W. H. Brewer was principal assistant in botany 
and agricultural geology. William Ashburner in mining, and W. M. 
Gabb, paleontologist. Clarence King also rendered assistance in a 
volunteer capacity. 

The results of this survey are embodied in three volumes on geology 
and paleontology published by the State and two volumes on the aurif- 
erous gravels, published b} r the Museum of Comparative Zoology at 
Harvard after Whitney's retirement. It was announced in the state- 
ment of progress for 1872-73 that a geological map of the whole State 
had been colored, but it seems never to have been published. 

The first volume of Whitney's report of progress and a s\"nopsis of 
field work from 1860 to 1864 appeared in 1865. This comprised a 
small quarto volume of 498 pages. The volume contained a great 
amount of descriptive matter relating to the areal geology of various 
parts of the State, particularly of the Coast Ranges and Sierra 
Nevada, with a chapter on the mining regions. 

Whitney decided, from the discovery of a single shell in the rooks 
of Alcatraz Island, that the so-called San Francisco sandstone was of 
undoubted Cretaceous age. The serpentines of Mount Diablo and the 
San Francisco peninsula he considered as metamorphic sediments 
(sandstone) — a mistake which was later repeated by Becker in his 
vol iime on the quicksilver deposits of the Pacific slope. 

Whitne} T was decidedly pessimistic regarding the probability of the 
occurrence of petroleum on the Pacific coast, and unhesitatingly dis- 
couraged the promoting of enterprises of this nature. With reference 
to the region south of the Bay of Monterey, he wrote: 

As the bituminous shales are everywhere turned up on edge and have no cover of 
impervious rock, the inference is unavoidable that flowing wells, or at least those 
delivering any considerable quantity of liquid petroleum, can not be expected to be 
got by boring to any depth. The probabilities, at least, are against it. 

When one reflects that the output of the California fields in 1891) 
amounted to 2,677,875 barrels, he is led to question the infallibility of 
Whitney's judgment in these matters. 

Whitney considered all those chains or ranges of mountains in Cali- 
fornia to belong to the Coast Ranges which had been uplifted since 
the deposition of the Cretaceous formation; those which were elevated 
before the Cretaceous as belonging to the Sierra Nevada. The slates 
of the western slope in Mariposa County were regarded as of Jurassic 
age, and the Calcareous slates of Plumas Count} 7 as belonging to the 



516 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Triassic. The limestones in the Gray Mountains had been referred by 
Doctor Trask to the Carboniferous formation. With this reference 
Whitney agreed. 

The peculiar dome-shaped concentric structure of the granite in the 
Sierras was dwelt upon with considerable detail, and the curved struc- 
ture of the sheets regarded as having been produced by the contrac- 
tion of the material while cooling or solidifying. The Yosemitc 
Valley itself he thought to be due to a differential movement, the half 
dome seeming beyond a doubt to have been split asunder in the 
middle, one-half having gone down in what he calls "the wreck of 
matter and the crush of worlds.' 1 In other words, he regarded the 
valley as due to the downward drop of an enormous fault block." 

The first volume of the paleontological reports appeared in 1864. 
This comprised 243 pages, with 32 full-page plates of fossils, the Car- 
boniferous and Jurassic being described by F. B. Meek, and the 
Cretaceous and Triassic by W. M. Gabb. Concerning the work thus 
far done, Whitney wrote: 6 

Perhaps the most striking result of the survey is the proof we have obtained of 
the immense development of rocks, equivalent in age to the upper Trias of the Alps, 
and paleontologically closely allied to the limestones of Hallstadt and Aussee, and 
the St. Cassian beds, that extremely important and highly fossilliferous division of 
the Alpine Trias. 

Further on he says: 

Enough (fossils), however, have been found to justify the assertion that the sedi- 
mentary portion of the great metalliferous belt of the Pacific coast of North America 
is chiefly made up of rocks of Jurassic and Triassic age. * * * "While we are 
fully justified in saying that a large portion of the, auriferous rocks of California consist 
<f metamorphic Triassic ami Jurassic strata, we have not a particle of evidence to 
uphold the theory * * * that all or even a portion are older than the Carbon- 
iferous. * * * We are able to state * * * that this metal (gold) occurs in 
no inconsiderable quantity in metamorphic rocks belonging as high up in series as 
the Cretaceous. (P. 261.) 

Subsequent to this, apparently W. P. Blake, as geologist of the 
California State Board of Agriculture, made a claim to having, in 1863, 
found on the American River a fossil ammonite, which he regarded as 
establishing the secondary age of the gold-bearing strata. It was 
claimed by Prof. W. H. Brewer, however, that Blake did not know 
for a certainty if the specimen was found in place or, indeed, if it 
were an ammonite or ceratite; also that the fossils were not found so 
early as the date claimed by Blake (1863). Brewer is very emphatic 
in his statements to the effect that Whitney was the first to announce 

a Later investigators have been inclined to regard the valley as due merely to river 
erosion, facilitated by the vertical jointing of the rocks. (See II. W. Turner, Proc. 
CaliforniaAcademyofScienc.es, Geology, I, No. 9, 1900.)

the Jura-Trias age of these rocks, and the extracts from the published 
reports seem to bear him out. 

The second volume of the paleontological reports, as published in 
1869, comprised 299 pages, with 36 full -page plates, and was given up 
wholly to descriptions of Tertiary and Cretaceous fossils by Gabb. 
In his introductory note Whitney reiterated his statement above quoted 
reerardiner the a^e of the gold-bearing rocks and the absence of rocks 
older than Carboniferous, not merely in the State, but west of the 
one hundred and sixteenth meridian. 

As previously noted (p. 385), Logan, during his period of service 

as provincial geologist, submitted sixteen reports dealing mainly with 

stratigraphic and economic subjects. In 1863 he brought forward a 

long promised volume — The Geology of Canada — a 

cSa! ?863 gy ° f large octavo, of 983 pages, accompanied by an atlas 

giving a colored geological map and sections. 

Logan was assisted during the early part of his work by Alexander 
Murray and James Richardson, geologists; E. Billings, paleontolo- 
gist, and T. Sterry Hunt, chemist. Later Robert Bell, now (1904) 
acting director, and others of less prominence, were added to the 
force. A portion of the paleontology was assigned to James Hall, 
and the nomenclature adopted was essentially that of the New York 
survey. 

The map accompanying the volume was beautifully executed in 
colors, and comprised all of the provinces southeast of the St. Law- 
rence as well as a narrow belt composed mainl} T of Laurentian, 
extending from Labrador southwesterly to the Great Lakes, and 
thence north westerly to the ninety-sixth meridian. It included a 
considerable portion of the United States, data for which were sup- 
plied by Hall and other American geologists. 

Overlying the graptolitic shales of the Utica and Hudson River 
formations in the vicinity of Quebec, Logan found a conformable 
series of sandstones, shales, and conglomerate limestones, which he 
considered, in spite of their position, as older than the Hudson River 
group formation and to which he applied, from their geographical 
position, the name of the Quebec group. This was again subdivided 
into an underlying green sandstone series called the Sillery formation, 
and an overlying Levis formation. These were supposed by both 
Logan and Billings to be mainly contemporaneous with the Calcifer- 
ous and Chazy groups of the New York geologists, but more recent 
investigations by Selwyn and Ellis have shown that while the Levis 
beds are Calciferous in the lower parts, the Sillery is probably all 
Cambrian (Dana), the Quebec, as a whole, being a northern continua- 
tion of the Taconic series. By a singular error, to which Marcou 
was prompt to call attention, this Quebec group on the map referred

to above was made to include the Chazy and Calciferous formations 
below the Trenton. 

It is worth} T of note that, while Logan's successors have been inva- 
riably opposed to the idea of the origin of the drift and rock striations 
through a glacial ice sheet, Logan evidently committed himself to 
this theory. Concerning the origin of the lake basins of western 
Canada he writes: 

These great lake basins are depressions, not of geological structure, but of denuda- 
tion, and the grooves on the surface rocks, which descend under their waters, appear 
to point to glacial action as one of the great causes which have produced these 
depressions. 

Again, in a footnote on the same page, he quoted, with evident 
approval, the following: 

This hypothesis (i. e., the origin of the lake basins) points to a glacial period when 
the whole region was elevated far above its present level, and when the Laurentides, 
the Adirondacks, and the Green Mountains were lofty Alpine ranges, covered with 
perpetual snow from which great frozen rivers or glaciers extended over the plains 
below, producing by their movements the glacial drift and scooping out the river 
valleys and the basins of the lakes. 

It was in this same report that Logan first noted the occurrence of 
a supposed fossil in the Laurentian of Canada, describing under the 
name of Stromatqpora rugosa an aggregate of crystalline pyroxene 
and calcite found by Mr. John Mullen in one of the bands of lime- 
stone at the Grand Calumet. This was the so-called Eozoon of Daw- 
son, referred to elsewhere. 

Logan, for his time, possessed a very profound insight into petro- 
graphical problems, though he naturally regarded as traces of an 
original bedding what is now known to be, in part, at least, foliation 
due to djmamic causes. Thus, in his reports for 1853-1856, he wrote 
concerning the rocks of the Laurentian system : 

They are the most ancient yet known on the continent of America, and are sup- 
posed to be equivalent to the iron-bearing series of Scandinavia. Stretching on the 
north side of the St. Lawrence from Labrador to Lake Superior, they occupy by far 
the larger share of Canada, and they have been described in former reports as sedi- 
mentary deposits in an altered condition, consisting of gneiss interstratified with 
important bands of crystalline limestone (p. 7). 

And again: 

The Laurentian series are altered sedimentary rocks. 

The geology of the islands of Anticosti, Mingan, and the Magdalen 
River region was assigned by Logan to James Richardson, who made 
his report in 1857. The fossils collected were worked up by Billings, 
who considered the rocks of the Anticosti group to consist of beds 
of passage from the Lower to the Upper Silurian and synchronous 
with the Oneida conglomerate, the Medina sandstone, and the Clinton

group of the New York .survey, and with the Caradoc formation of 
England. 

The possibility that the Laurentian system might not be a single 
unit was here again recognized b} 7 Logan in a supplementary note: 

If, on- exploration to the eastward of the Trembling Mountain, it should be further 
ascertained that the two inferior limestone bands of the Greenville series disappear 
on reaching the margin of the anorthosite, it may be considered as conclusive evi- 
dence of the existence in the Laurentian system of two immense sedimentary forma- 
tions, the one superimposed unconformably on the other, with probably a great 
difference in time between them; and it will be an interesting subject of inquiry 
whether the intrusive rocks which have been found intersecting the lower division 
give any clue to events which may have happened in the interval. 

Logan was born of Scottish parentage at Montreal in 1798, but his 
father shortly returning to Scotland, he received his early training, 
which was classical, in the High School and University of Edinburgh. 
He showed no disposition toward scientific pursuits 
sketch of Logan. until chance led him to the keeping of accounts in 
the establishment of an uncle, who was interested in 
mining and copper smelting operations in Wales. Here he was 
attracted by the phenomena of the coal seams and devoted a large 
share of his spare time to their study. 

In 1838 the death of his uncle caused him to give up his position in 
Wales, and in 1840 he returned to Canada. His first geological paper 
was on the character of the beds of clay immediately below the coal 
seams of South Wales. This was communicated to the Geological 
Society of London in 1840. In this he announced . the invariable 
presence under the coal seams of beds of fire clay carrying Stigmaria. 
This he regarded as proving the origin of coal through plant growth 
in place — an opinion which was very generally accepted at that time. 

When Logan began his geological work in Canada a large portion 
of the country was a wilderness, without roads, and there were no 
maps. Of the topography of the Gaspe district it is written: 

Little was known of the region beside the coast line; of the geology, practically 
nothing. Settlements were few, confined almost exclusively to the coast, and made 
up chiefly of fishermen. There were no roads through the interior, most of which 
was, and indeed still is, a wilderness, inhabited by bears and other wild beasts, or at 
best only penetrated in certain regions by a few Indians or lumbermen. The courses 
of most of the streams were unknown and the mountains untraversed. 

Living the life of a savage, sleeping on the beach in a blanket sack, with my feet 
to the fire, seldom taking my clothes off, eating salt pork and ship's biscuit, occasion- 
ally tormented by mosquitoes. 

« Prof. N. S. Shaler, in a paper before the Boston Society of Natural History, 
December 18, 1861, antagonized that view and argued that from the base of the 
level of the Canadian channel to the summit at the southwestern point of the island 
the beds were entirely Upper Silurian and synchronous with the Clinton and Niagara, 
of New York and elsewhere, though the fossils themselves might not be absolutely 
identified.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



Such is the record Logan has left us of his Gaspe experience. From 
early dawn to dusk he paced or paddled, and yet his work was not 
finished, for while his Indians — often his solo companions — smoked 
their pipes around the evening fire he wrote his notes and platted the 
day's measurements. 

Logan is represented to us as strong in body, of active mind, indus- 
trious, and doggedly persevering, painstaking, a lover of truth, gen- 
erous, possessed of the keenest knowledge of human nature, sound of 
judgment, but always cautious in expressing an opinion. 

During his twenty-seven years of office, sixteen reports were sub- 
mitted, the first, that for the year 1843, appearing in the form of a 
pamphlet of 159 octavo pages. It contained remarks on the mode of 
making a geological survey and a short preliminary report containing 
general observations on the geology of the provinces, and adjacent 

portions of the United States, together with 
the Joggins section already mentioned. 

Assisted by Mr. Alexander Murray, and 
later by the chemist, T. Sterry Hunt, Logan 
continued his work until 1869, when he 
resigned to be succeeded by Mr. Selwyn. 
His reports cover the geology of Ottawa, 
the Gaspe peninsula, the economic geology 
of the Lake Superior region, the geolog} 7 
of lower Canada with especial reference to 
tin- <'astern townships, the region along the 
north coast of Lake Huron, the gold-bearing 
fields of the Chaudiere region, and the west- 
ern peninsula, also the region between the 
Ottawa, the St. Lawrence, and the Rideau. 
His most important publication was his geology of Canada, noticed 
above. His geological map, bearing date of 1866 and measuring 8 
by 3i feet, is said to have been the largest and most comprehensive 
that had appeared up to that time. 

Under the directorship of Logan, Alexander Murray, assisted by 
James P. Howley, began work on the geology of Newfoundland in 
1864, making a first brief report in May, 1866. The survey was con- 
tinued until 1880, and a reprint of all the reports pub-

and Howley in lished in book torm — an octavo volume ot 5^6 pages —

in 1881. 
The work as a whole consisted mainly of details of structure of the 
regions immediately along the coast, with notes on the mines. The 
various subdivisions of the formations adopted were naturally those 
of the Canadian survey, which were based to a considerable extent 
upon those of the New York survey.

AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1860-1869. 521 

Naturally, Murray's observations were limited mainly to a compar- 
atively narrow belt along- the coast. W ith the exception of the Glacial 
and post-Glacial material, no formations were found of later date than 
the Carboniferous. The succession of the Lower Silurian formations 
of the island from above downward he gave as follows: Sillery, Lau- 
zon, Levis, Upper Calciferous, Lower Calciferous, Upper Potsdam, 
Lower Potsdam, and St. John's Group. The St. John's Group is now 
recognized as Middle Cambrian (?), while his Lower Potsdam is Lower 
Cambrian. 

Before the beginning of Murray's work it had already been shown 
by Richardson, working under direction of Logan, that a trough of 
Lower Silurian rocks must underlie the northern part of the Gulf of 
St. Lawrence, gradually narrowing toward the Strait of Belle Isle, one 
side of the trough rising on the coast of Labrador, while the other 
formed the western shore of Newfoundland from Bonne Bay to Cape 
Norman. On each side of the Strait these rocks were found to rest 
on Laurentian gneiss, which was ascertained to extend from the neigh- 
borhood of Bonne Bay to within 12 or 15 miles of Hare Bay. 

Murray's investigations proved that the Laurentian rocks spread in 
breadth to the Atlantic coast of the great northern peninsula of the 
island, and that the base of the Lower Silurian strata, sweeping around 
the northern extremity of the gneiss, comes upon the coast near Canada 
Bay, and again strikes into the land at Coney Arm in White Bay, 
w T here the Lower Silurian are overlaid by Upper Silurian, followed 
by rocks of Devonian age. Farther to the southeast the Laurentian 
and Silurian series were found to be partially and unconformably cov- 
ered by rocks of Carboniferous age. 

The report was accompanied by a colored geological map on ten 
sheets, on a scale of 25 miles to the inch. 

As already noted, the Canadian geologists, with the exception of 
Logan, have never taken kindly to the idea of a glacial ice sheet, but 
have sought to account for the distribution of the drift, erosion, and 
allied or associated phenomena through other means. 
Gfa^fa «on V !864. on Tnus > J - W - Dawson, in his address before the Nat- 
ural History Society of Montreal in 1864, took occasion 
to combat vigorously the idea, on the ground that " it requires a series 
of suppositions unlikely in themselves and not warranted by facts;" 
that it seems physically impossible for a sheet of ice to move over an

that the sea at that period had much the same temperature as the pres- 
ent Arctic currents, and that the land was not covered by ice. - 



522 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Id describing the northeasterly and .southwesterly and northwesterly 
and southeasterly directions of the rock striae, he announced that he 
had no hesitation in asserting that the force which produced the south- 
westerly striae was "from the ocean toward the interior, against the 
slope of the St. Lawrence valley," and as he could not conceive of a 
glacier moving from the Atlantic up into the interior he considered 
this as at once disposing of the glacial theory. He conceived, rather, 
that a subsidence took place sufficient to convert all the plains of 
Canada, New York, and New England into sea. This, he felt, would 
determine the direction of the Arctic current which would move up 
this slope. He would account for the excavation of the basins of the 
Great Lakes in a similar way. Supposing the land submerged so that 
the Arctic current from the northeast should pour over the Laurentian 
rocks on the northern side of Lake Superior and Lake Huron, it would 
cut out the softer strata, forming the basins and drifting the material 
to the southwest. 

The lower strata of this current would be directed through and 
between the Laurentide hills and the Adirondacks, and, flowing over 
the ridge of hard rock which connects them at the Thousand Isles, 
would cut out the basin of Lake Ontario and heap up at the same time 
the mass of bowlder clay intervening between Lake Ontario and 
Georgian Bay. Lake Erie, he thought, might have been cut by the 
flow of the upper layers of water over the middle Silurian escarpment, 
Lake Michigan being likewise due to this unequal erosion. The 
northwesterly and southeasterly stria? he conceived were produced by 
a return of the northeast-southwest current, obstructions causing it 
to flow along the valleys of Lake Champlain, the Connecticut, and 
the low countiy between Lake Ontario and Lake Huron. He would 
not wholly exclude the action of glaciers, but thought such were 
limited to the mountain tops. Old sea beaches, he thought, had been 
mistaken for moraines, and he found evidences of ocean breakers 
almost to the summits of the White Mountains. Lake basins and 
fiords in the northern latitudes are all due to current and wave action, 
the cold Arctic currents being appealed to rather than the warm 
surface currents. He also felt sure that the numerous indentations of 
the coast of the United States were due to the action of waves rather 
than of ice. 

In the autumn and winter of 1863-64 Raphael Pumpelly, of Rhode 
Island, was engaged by the Chinese Government to examine the coal 
fields west of Peking. Incidentally he made journeys in northern 

China and Mongolia. Subsequently, in 1864-65, he 
china e 'i 863^64 rk ' n c "°* 8e d into Siberia and journeyed overland to St. 

Petersburg. The results of his observations on the 
geology of the region were published in the Smithsonian Contributions 
to Knowledge, 1866, forming a quarto pamphlet of 144 pages with 8

plates of sections, and a colored geological map, the latter confessedly 
hypothetical. This memoir, which antedated Richthofen's great work 
on China by some } r ears, gave to the world the first authentic account 
of the geology of the region. 

He showed that in the region extending from the twentieth to a little 
beyond the fortieth parallel and from near the one hundredth to about 
the one hundred and twenty-second meridian the oldest sedimentary 
rocks were Devonian limestones, which prevailed in some cases to 
the enormous thickness of 11,600 feet. Overlying this, through the 
greater part of the area, were the Chinese Coal Measures (Mesozoic), 
interrupted by bands of granitic and metamorphic rock of undeter- 
mined age. In the extreme northern part of this region was a com- 
parative^ small area of basaltic and trachytic rocks. The region 
immediately south of Peking, comprised principally within the prov- 
inces of Chihli, Nganhwui. Kiangsu. and Shantung, was colored, as 
occupied by post-Tertiary materials, with 
smaller areas of the same age along the 
Yangtse-Kiang and Hoangho rivers in the 
provinces of Hupeh, Sz'chuen, and Shensi. 

Considerable attention was given to the 
post-Tertiary li Terrace" deposit, or loam, 
which he found in the valley of every tribu- 
tary of the Yang Ho, and probably also of 
the Sankang Ho. This, which has since be- 
come more generally known as the Chinese 
loess, was described in considerable detail as 
to modes of occurrence, physical properties, 
and geological distribution. The material 
he regarded as having been deposited in a 
chain of lakes extending from Yenkingchau 
north-northwest of Peking to near Ninghia, in Kansuh, a distance of 
nearly 500 miles, the lake basins themselves being formed by the dis- 
locations which gave rise to the plateau wall to the north, and being 
tilled by sediments brought by the Yellow River. 

The fossil plants brought by Pumpelly from the coal-bearing rocks 
were studied by Newberiy and identitied as of Mesozoic age. 

George H. Cook, who was assistant geologist of New Jersey under 

the Kitchell survey (suspended in 1856), was appointed State geologist 

with the reorganization of the same survey in 1863, and continued to 

serve in this capacity until the time of his death in 

Cook's Survey of 1 

New Jersey, 1889. His first annual report, that tor 1861, bearing- 

1863-1889. ,i,,i 

the date of 1865, was a small pamphlet of but 20 pages, 
and contained a single-page colored geological map of the State, the 
second of its kind to be issued, the first having been by H. D. Rogers. 




l Pumpelly. 



524 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

One of the first tasks which Doctor Cook imposed upon himself 
alter his appointment was the preparation of a large octavo volume, 
accompanied by a portfolio of maps, setting- forth the condition of the 
knowledge of geology of the State up to the date of publication (1868). 
In this work he gave a general summary of all his previous work, and 
upon it we will draw largely for other facts which may be given here. 

Naturally the question of the age and stratigraphic position of the 
white limestone came up for discussion. He quoted the opinion of 
Rogers (p. 326), and found reason for differing with him. He wrote: 

In regard to the crystalline limestones he was mistaken. They are everywhere 
conformable to the gneiss and interstratified with it. His mistake is acknowledged 
by his former assistant, J. P. Lesley, in the American Journal of Science, LXXXIX, 
p. 221. The true position and identity in age of the crystalline limestone and 
gneiss was proved by Vanuxem ami Keating, in the Journal of the Academy of 
Natural Sciences in 1822, and this view has been sustained by all the observations of 
Doctor Kitchell and his assistants and can be easily verified by anyone who will 
visit the localities cited in this report." 

Cook was inclined to regard the magnetic iron ore as of sedimen- 
tary origin, deposited in beds just as were the gneiss and crystalline 
limestone, in this respect agreeing with Doctor Kitchell and disagree- 
ing with H. D. Rogers. 

As early as 1854 Cook had called attention to the gradual subsidence 
of the coast of New Jersey, and before his death was able to give 
absolute figures regarding the rate of depression. 

Cook was born in Hanover, New Jersey, in 1818, and educated in the 
public schools of the State and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 
whence he graduated in 1839 with the degree of C. E. After gradua- 
tion he remained at the Institute as tutor, adjunct pro- 
sketch of cook. fessor, and finally full professor, until 1846, when he 
removed to Albany, New York, where he was engaged 
at first in business and latterly as professor of mathematics and natural 
philosophy, and finally principal of the Albany Academy. 

In 1852 he was sent to Europe by the State authorities of New York 
to study the salt deposits, with a view of developing those of Onondaga 
County. In 1853 he accepted a call to the chair of chemistry and 
natural sciences in Rutgers College, New Jersey, retaining his connec- 
tion with the institution during the remainder of his life, though after 
1854 being actively connected with the State geological survey. In 
L880, moreover, he was made director of the State agricultural exper- 
iment station, which, indeed, had been established largely through his 
efforts. 

"Studies by Mr. A. C. Spencer, of the United States Geological Survey, made dur- 
ing the season of 1904, point to an igneous origin for the gneiss. This view, of course, 
effectively disposes of the idea that the limestone is conformable with the gneiss and 
interstratiried with it.

AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1860-1869. 525 

A noble and unselfish man, who, as some one lias expressed it, "went 
in and out of the houses of this State, making- friends of every man, 
woman, and child he met." Farseeing, persistent, ever calm and judi- 
cious in his work, yet light hearted and cheerful among his friends — 

his broad expanse of face, full of light, his eyes gleaming with kindliness, as well as 
with shrewdness, and often with a right-merry twinkle; his genial smile, his frank 
greeting, never marred by any hollow and flippant phrase of mere etiquette, but as 
honest as it is cordial; his sympathy, so responsive yet so genuine; his massive 
though quiet strength of purpose; and his self-contained, self-poised nature, all 
crowned with boundless hopefulness, united to make his very presence an inspira- 
tion and benediction. 

In the author's memory there are two men among American geolo- 
gists who stand out as devotees of science, yet entirely free from the 
narrowness of the specialist or the personal idiosyncrasies that so fre- 
quently mar the character of men of their class. These two men are 
George H. Cook and Edward Orton. They loved science for science 
sake, yet did not close their eyes to its eco- 
nomic bearing, nor call upon an overtaxed 
public to support them in the work they 
loved, regardless of its outcome. Never a 
minister of the gospel had the interests of 
his parishioners more at heart than these two 
men that of the public they served. For 
themselves they asked simply the privilege 
of doing the work and doing it to the best of 
their ability. 

B. F. Mudge, as State geologist, submitted 
his First Annual Report on the Geology of 
Kansas for the year 1864, in form of an 

OctaVO Volume of 56 pages, FlG - 76.-Benjamin Franklin 

Mudge 

^°^°I^-^^i ge in 1866. He announced the

lowest geological formation of the State to be the upper 
portion of the Coal Measures, of which be gave a section in Leaven- 
worth County. He accepted the identification of the Permian age of 
the fossils which had been described b}' Meek. Hayden, and Swallow, 
and noted the occurrence of the Triassic and probably the Jurassic 
also, in a belt of territory crossing the Republican and Smoky Hill 
valleys, and also the Cretaceous, the geographic limits of which had 
not been worked out. He regarded the drift and erratic bowlders as 
due to icebergs. 

Professor Mudge was born in Maine in 1817, and graduated at 

Wesleyan University, Connecticut, in 1840. After 
sketch of Mudge. graduation he studied law and, being admitted to the 

bar, practiced his profession in Lynn. Massachusetts, 
until 1859. During 1859 and 1860 he was employed as chemist in the 
Chelsea, Massachusetts, and Breckinridge, Kentucky, oil refineries, 




526 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

and in 1861 he removed to what is now Kansas City, Kansas, where he 
engaged in teaching. Such a life would now be considered as little 
fitting a man for the profession of geology, yet in 1864, having by 
invitation delivered a course of lectures before the Kansas legislature 
upon the geological resources of the State, he was unanimously elected 
State geologist, a position which he, however, filled for but a single 
3 7 ear, resigning to accept the professorship in natural history in the 
Agricultural College at Manhattan, where he remained until 1873. 
His resignation from this last position is stated to have been caused 
by disgust aroused at the political conditions in which the institution 
became involved and the assumption of its presidency b}^ a well-known 
politician, with no qualifications whatever for the position. 

Although by profession a lawyer, Mudge is stated to have been 
throughout his whole life deeply interested in natural sciences, and 
while in Lynn to have taken an active part in the organization of the 
Lynn Natural History Society. In Kansas his scientific work was 
largely in the line of exploration. 

Arduous, intrepid, willingly undergoing hardships and dangers for the sake of 
science, he explored a very large part of Kansas when explorations meant real 
dangers and hardships of the most pronounced kind. As early as 1870 he made 
explorations in the extreme western part of the State in the study of its geology and 
paleontology, and for years afterwards nearly every summer found him in the midst 
of the Indian country, usually wholly without protection from the danger of hostile 
Indians, save such as his own rifle and revolver afforded. In the summer of 1874 he 
explored the whole length of the Smoky Hill River, an utterly trackless wild, 
infested by Indians, whose murderous depredations were visible on every side. 

Mudge's bibliography is brief and the papers generally limited to 
but a few pages at most. His material he willingly put in the hands 
of others for publication, and Marsh, Cope, White, and Lesquereux 
profited thereby. It was during one of these earlier trips that he dis- 
covered the first specimen of Ichthyornis, which, coming into the 
hands of Marsh, did so much toward making the latter famous. 

Mudge made the first geological map of the State (Kansas), which 
is fairly correct in its main features, save for the Lower Cretaceous, 
which he failed to recognize. 

He mapped and described with tolerable accuracy and fullness the physical struc- 
tures of the different Cretaceous and Tertiary horizons. Much, if not most, of the 
information thus given was based upon his patient researches in wagon or on foot. 
In general it may truthfully be said that his pioneer work in Kansas geology was 
important and extensive, though now largely superseded by more detailed and 
accurate studies. His work in life, however, has chiefly borne fruit as a teacher. He 
was widely known as an enthusiastic and able lecturer, and his courses were always 
in demand by the teachers and scientific men of the State. His quiet modesty and 
unselfishness disarmed all envy and jealousy. Of most charming personality, of 
wide culture, and unbounded enthusiasm, his teachings made an unusual impression 
upon all with whom he came in contact.

In 1866, G. C. Swallow, who succeeded B. F. Mudge as State 

geologist, issued a Preliminary Report of the Geological Survey of

of Kansas, 1866. . „ TT . . 

Ma], r. Hawn was assistant geologist. 

Special attention was given to the eastern and central part of the 
State. He found rocks belonging to Quaternary, Tertiary, Creta- 
ceous, Triassic (?), Permian, Lower Permian, and Carboniferous for- 
mations, the lowermost division being the Lower Carboniferous. The 
buff, mottled, and red sandstones underlying the Cretaceous were 
doubtfully referred to the Triassic from their resemblance to the 
foreign Triassic and the presence of a Nueula resembling the Speciosa 
of Munster from the Muschelkalk of Bindlock. The presence of 
Permian beds, it will be remembered, he had previously announced. 
The coal-bearing rocks he estimated at 2,000 feet in thickness and 
underlying an area of over 17,000 square 
miles. In these he announced twenty-two 
distinct and separate beds of coal, ranging 
in thickness from 1 to 7 feet. 

This work of Swallow in Kansas has been 
largely overlooked by recent workers. Ac- 
cording to Keyes," a large portion of it was 
not only good but marvelously well done for 
its day and the conditions under which it Avas 
accomplished. The historical importance of 
Swallow's work "lies in the fact that some 
of his geographic names applied to geologic 
terranes will have to stand as valid terms, al- 
though his correlations were often veiy bad." 

Swallow, like Mudge, was born in Maine, 
but was of Norman-French descent. He studied the natural sciences 
under Parker Cleaveland, at Bowdoin College, graduating in 1813, and, 
after several years in educational work, accepted the 
sketch of swallow, chair of chemistry, geology, and mineralogy in the 
University of Missouri in Columbia. From 1856 to 
lsf>L, the date of the discontinuation of the survey, he served as 
geologist of Missouri, and in 1865 was appointed State geologist of 
Kansas, as elsewhere noted. 

He is represented to us as a large, fine-looking man, over 6 feet in 
height, and a very close observer of all natural phenomena. Accord- 
ing to Professor Broadhead, "No other man during the same length 
of time has ever gone into a strange field, traversed the country, and 
published a volume all in a year and a half, as he did." Swallow was

connected for a time (1867-1870) with mining operations in Montana, 
but his scientific field was limited wholly to Missouri and Kansas. 

At the December (1865) meeting of the Boston Society of Natural 

History, Dr. N. S. Shaler, then but twenty-four }^ears of age and a 

graduate of the Lawrence Scientific School in Cambridge, made some 

interesting remarks on the elevation of continental 

N. S. Shaler's Views 

on Continental uplift, masses. Referring to the assumptions of Charles 
Babbage and Sir John Herschel relative to the 
shifting of isothermal lines and consequent expansion and local uplift 
along lines of deposition, he went on to argue that for the same reason 
sea bottoms on which sedimentation was taking place would be areas 
of depression, since the curving must take place in the direction of 
greatest expansion. In like manner, uplifting would take place along 
lines of denudation. The intermediate point between the two zones of 
movement would naturally be the sea border, and hence here would 
occur the fracturing of the superincumbent strata and resultant vol- 
canic phenomena. In this way, assuming the original nuclei of the 
continents, or points first elevated above sea level, to have been in 
the northern portion of the sphere, he thought it probable they would 
continue to grow by uplift southward in a succession of southwardly - 
pointed triangles. 

Some six months later, in June, 1866, he read before the same 
society a paper on the formation of mountain chains, which is also of 
interest in this connection. Accepting the theory that the earth's 
mass consists of a solid nucleus, a hardened outer crust, and an inter- 
mediate zone of slight depth in a condition of imperfect igneous 
fusion, he argued, as in a previous paper, that while the continental 
folds were probably corrugations of the whole thickness of the crust 
the mountain chains were but folds of the outer portion caused by the 
contraction of the lower portions of this outer shell, the contraction 
in both cases being due to loss of heat. Further, the subsidence of 
the ocean's floors would, through producing fractures and dislocations 
along those lines, tend to promote the formation of mountain chains 
along and parallel with the sea borders. 

Still again, in 1868, Shaler (having in the meantime been elected 
professor of geology in Harvard University) brought up before the 
Society the matter of the nature of the movements involved in the 
changes of level of shore lines, and this time with particular reference 
to changes coincident with or subsequent to the Glacial period. He 
showed that local phenomena of continental uplift or depression, as 
measured by the level of the sea at the shore line, might be variously 
modified by the position of the points of rotation, whether immedi- 
ately at the shore line or at a greater or less distance, either seaward 
or inland. Of greater significance, however, were his remarks rela- 
tive to the changes in level at the time of glaciation. Referring to

a previous paper, where he showed that a compound bar would, when 
heated, bend toward the side composed of the most expansive mate- 
rial, he compared such a bar to a portion of the earth's crust covered 
with several thousand feet of ice and snow. The effect of this blanket 
would be to cause the isothermal lines to move outward toward the 
surface, causing thus an expansion of that portion of the crust imme- 
diately beneath the ice. But the ice itself would partake very slightly, 
if at all, of this increased temperature, and, as in the case of the com- 
pound bar, the bending would take place in the direction of maximum 
expansion, i. e., in this particular case, downward. In this way, he 
suggested, the depression accompanying the period of maximum glacia- 
tion might be accounted for. 

C. F. Hartt and Orestes St. John accompanied Agassiz in the capac- 
ity of geologists on the Thayer Expedition to Brazil during the years 
1865-66. In 1867 Hartt made a second 

journey, spending several ^iSBBt^^

tween rernambuco and Rio, 
exploring more particularly the vicinity of 
Bahia and the islands and coral reefs of the 
Abrolhos. 

The results of this and the previous ex- 
pedition were published in book form in 
1870, under the title of Geology andPhysical 
Geography of Brazil. In this work the 
gneisses of the Province of Rio de Janeiro 
are regarded as metamorphosed or sedi- 
mentary deposits and of Azoic age. Their 
thickness he did not even estimate, recog- 
nizing the fact that their apparent enormous thickness was due to 
numerous reversed folds, so that one might travel for miles over their 
upturned edges, finding them always highly inclined and dipping in 
the same general direction. 

Concerning the probable age of the metamorphic rocks succeeding 
the gneisses he found no proof, though it was suggested they might 
be Silurian or Devonian. South of Rio he found unmistakable Car- 
boniferous rocks, including beds of bituminous coal, and in the prov 
ince of Sergipe, underling the Cretaceous, a thick series of red 
sandstones, referred to the Triassic. No Jurassic was recognized. 

Marine Cretaceous beds of undetermined extent were found north 
of the Abrolhos Islands, which were conformably overlaid by clays 
and ferruginous sandstone, referred to the Tertiary. Overlying this 
along the whole coast he found an immense sheet of structureless 
clays, gravels, and bowlder deposits, which he believed, with Agassiz. 
to have been the work of glacial ice, though he noted that nowhere

had there been seen either polished or striated rocks, such as are 
almost constant accompaniments of glaciation elsewhere. It is almost 
needless to add that this view is no longer held by anyone, the bowl- 
ders supposed to have been erratics being merely bowlders of decom- 
position and their distribution the work of gravity and water. 

In 1870 Hartt went again to Brazil, and in 1875, while professor of 
geology at Cornell University, was appointed chief of the geological 
commission of that country, with Richard Rathbun as assistant. He 
died in 1878. 

An act of the State legislature of Minnesota approved March 2, 

1865, provided for the establishment of a State geological survey, but 

one which proved short-lived. Henry E. Eames was made State 

geologist, and during his term of office made two brief 

H. E. EamessWork & ° ' ° , 

in Minnesota, reports ot 23 and 58 pages respectively, both bearing 

on the title page the date of 1866. The work was 
almost wholl}' of an economic nature. 

Eugene W. Hilgard, in an article in the American Journal of Sci- 
ence for 1866, pointed out the great difference in the character of the 
drift in the north and northeast and that of the west (Mississippi Val- 
ley). He felt that the glacial theory alone, as then 
"h^Drift! T866 8 ° n understood, could not account for these deposits north 
of the Ohio any more than for the Osage sand delta 
south of it. Though referring to Agassiz\s observation regarding 
"the melting snow of the declining glacial epoch" and its instru- 
mentality in forming river terraces, he adopted as more plausible the 
idea first announced by Tourney to the effect that the southern drift 
may have been formed in consequence of the sudden melting of the 
northern glaciers, "such as would have resulted from a first rapid 
depression of so large a mass of ice below the snow line." At first the 
flood action would be violent, producing the deep erosion of the under- 
lying formations and the transportation and redeposition in mass of 
their materials. After the first rush, the stratified deposits would be 
formed, mingled with more or less bowlder material from floating ice. 
The influx of cold water from the north would, he thought, account 
for the absence of signs of life in the deposits. The "grandly simple 
means of a single elevation and redepression in the northern latitudes 
* * * will equally satisfy the conditions required for the forma- 
tion of the western and southern drift." 

W. C. Kerr, who succeeded Professor Emmons as State geologist of 
North Carolina, received his commission on April 1, 1866, and con- 
tinued in service until the time of his death, in 1885.

1867, was an octavo volume ot 56 pages, in which the 
purposes of the survey were set forth and a summaiy of the geology 
of the western part of the State given, so far as known. The rocks of 



AMERICAN" GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1860-1869. 531 

this western area were regarded as belonging " to the most ancient of 
the Azoic series," and to have been above sea level since very ancient 
times. As with his predecessors, Kerr was troubled to account for 
the drift, noting that while it occurred far beyond the limits usually 
ascribed to glacial action, yet there were " numerous phenomena which 
have no other plausible explanation." 

Kerr's second report, submitted in 1869, was of equal brevity, but 
naturally contained more of the results of the author's personal obser- 
vations. He noted that the mountains, plateaus, and valleys of the 
French Broad and Lower Catawba areas owed " their existence and all 
the details of their form and position to the action of water, the basins 
* * * being * * * without exception, valleys of erosion, hav- 
ing in no case an anticlinal or synclinal origin." 

The entire western portion of the State he considered as consisting 
of four groups or formations, first, the— 

Cherokee slates along the Smoky Mountains, on the northwest border, consisting 
of clay slates and shales, sandstones, grits, conglomerates, and limestones; second, 
the Buncombe group, occupying the larger portion of the great transmontane pla- 
teau between the Blue Bidge and Smoky Mountains, and consisting of gneissic and 
granitoid rocks; third, the Linville slates, a narrow belt stretching for the most part 
along the Blue Bidge and composed, like the first group, of semimetamorphic argil- 
laceous slates and shales, sandstones, limestone, and gneissoid grits; fourth, the 
Biedmont group, gneissic and granitoid. 

He noted further that these four groups constituted two recurrences- 
of the same rocks, in the same order, recalling Rogers's theory of redu- 
plication by folding and overturns, as worked out in Pennsylvania. 

John L. Le Conte, a cousin of the Joseph Le Conte, elsewhere 
noted, is known to science rather through his entomological than geo- 
logical writings. Five papers are credited to his pen by Darton in his 
John l. Le Conte's Catalogue and Index of North American Geology. Of 
Rai'rroad a Jurvey. these, the most important and the only one that need 
,867, here be considered is one on the geology of the survey 

for the extension of the Union Pacific Railroad from the Smoky Hill 
River, Kansas, to the Rio Grande. He made a detailed study of the 
coal beds, and on the basis of their molluscan remains maintained that 
such were of Cretaceous age rather than Tertiary, as claimed by 
Lesquereux. His reasoning as to the relative value of botanical and 
molluscan remains for determining the age of beds is worthy of note. 
He wrote: "The difference between the plants of our early Cretaceous 
and those of the European middle Tertiary could be ascertained only 
after much discussion and by the stratigraphy of the region, and we 
have no right from a few resemblances in vegetables to infer the syn- 
chronism either of the western lignite beds with each other, or any of 
them with the European Eocene and Miocene, except when supported 
by paleontological evidence derived from animal remains." In this 
most geologists will now agree with him. 



532 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, L904. 

Le Conte's views, as shown in this report, concerning the general 
development of the western portion of the continent, indicated an 
ability to deal with the larger problems of geology in a philosophical 
and highly satisfactory manner, and it is perhaps to be regretted that 
he should have allowed himself to be drawn oft' into other pursuits. 
As noted, this paper was the most important of his geological writings, 
as it was also the last. 

The second geological survey of Iowa was inaugurated in April, 

lSOti, with Dr. Charles A. White as director, and Orestes St. John, 

principal geological assistant. The survey continued to the end of 

1869, results being published in the form of two royal 

iowa te 1866^1*869? octavo volumes, comprising all told some 443 pages, 

with a colored geological map of the entire State. 

As Hall and Whitney had devoted a large portion of their attention 
during the previous survey to the eastern part of the State, so White 
devoted himself mainly to an investigation of the phenomena of the 
western part. He found reason, as noted in his introductory letter to 
the governor, to discourage all explorations for mineral oils or precious 
metals in the State, and also pointed out the hazard of exploring for 
coal beyond the northern and eastern boundaries of the coal held as 
designated in his geological map. He also showed that, though iron 
ore of a good quality had frequently been found in the State, the 
deposits were always limited. In all of these points he was correct. 

Considerable attention was given to the peat deposits and an esti- 
mate made of the amount of material within the State limits which 
could be utilized for fuel purposes should occasion demand. 

Among the phenomena of lesser importance he called attention to 
the moving of the bowlders on the shores of lakes and piling them 
into wall-like masses through the expansive action of the freezing- 
water. The so-called Bin ft' deposit he considered to be of more recent 
origin than the drift, and referred it to the earliest part of the so-called 
Terrace epoch, the material composing it having originated by fliuvia- 
• tile erosion immediately upon the close of the Glacial epoch, being 
afterwards deposited as a lacustral sediment in the broad depression in 
the surface of the drift left by the retreating glaciers. He differed 
entirely with Whitney as to the cause of the absence of trees in the 
prairie region, and felt no hesitation in declaring that the real cause 
of the existence of the prairies in Iowa was the recurrence of the 
annual tires. 

He divided the formations of the State into Azoic, Lower Silurian, 
Upper Silurian and Devonian, Carboniferous, and Cretaceous systems, 
and regarded the Sioux Falls quartzite, with its associated pipestone, 
as belonging to the Azoic. The Potsdam sandstone, which he found 
reaching a thickness in the State of about 300 feet, he thought to be 
probably overlying this Sioux quartzite. This view is generally held 
to-day. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1800-1869. 588 

White regarded it as evident that there was no hope of profitable 
lead mining within the limits of the State in the Lower Magnesian 
limestone, in this agreeing with Whitney (p. 408). For the so-called 
Hudson River shales of Hall he substituted the name of Maqnoketa 
shales. All the Devonian rocks of the State he referred to the Ham- 
ilton period. 

He found a strict conformability in all the rocks from the Potsdam 
sandstones to the Keokuk limestone, inclusive, but between this last 
and the rocks of the Coal Measures an unconformability and also one 
between the St. Louis limestone and the older formations of the sub- 
Cretaceons group. Instead of there being only one formation of Car- 
boniferous limestone, as had been generally supposed, White claimed 
to have found two, each possessing similar lithological but different 
paleontological characteristics, the one overlying and the other under- 
lying the coal-producing strata. 

The various folds found in the strata of the Iowa rocks he regarded 
as all having taken place subsequent to the deposition of the latest 
strata of Carboniferous age and before any of those of Cretaceous age 
were deposited. 

The gypsum deposits were thought to be presumably of Mesozoic 
age and as having originated through chemical precipitation in com- 
paratively still waters which were saturated with sulphate of lime and 
destitute of life. The fact that these deposits contained no fossils 
rendered the exact determination of their geological age a matter of 
some difficulty. It is therefore well to note that Kcyes in his report 
in 1895 refers them to the upper part of the Mesozoic — the Cretaceous.' 

White, it should be noted, had in I860 6 described in considerable 
detail the rocks and their included fossils in the vicinity of Burling- 
ton, Iowa. He identified here eight beds, the lower six of which he 
regarded as the equivalent of, though not necessarily contempora- 
neous with, the Chemung of New York. The two upper beds, which 
were of limestone, he regarded as Carboniferous, though he remarked 
that the line drawn between the two formations was largely imagi- 
nary, indicating merely the limit where the Devonian species ceased to 
predominate and upward from which the Carboniferous species 
flourished in full force. 

It was suggested that the Devonian species might have originated 
at the east and migrated westward during the time that the bottom of 
the Chemung sea was gradually sinking and receiving the deposits 
forming the Old Red sandstone, thus making the Devonian rocks 
equivalent to the New York Chemung and contemporaneous, in part 
at least, with the Old Red Sandstone of the Catskill Mountains.**

c All of the six beds then supposed to bs Devonian are now commonly regarded as 
belonging to the basal Carboniferous ( Kinderhook).

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM. 1904. 



Safford's Final Report 
on the Geology of 
Tennessee, 1869. 



Later (in 1866) Niles and Wachsmuth studied the upper beds, which 
had become known as the Burlington limestone, and were led by the 
c rinoidal remains to regard the two divisions as two independent for- 
mations, which the}^ designated as the Lower and Upper Burlington, 
a subdivision which still holds. 

Safford's final report on the geology of Tennessee did not appear 
until 1869, having been delayed by the incidents of the civil war. It 

was accompanied by a col- 
ored geological map of the 
State, and a geological sec- 
tion, un- 
co 1 o r e d , 
extending 
from the Unaka chain on the 
cast of the Mississippi, and 
giving, on the whole, a very 
comprehensive and easity un- 
derstood idea of the physical 
geography and geology of 
the State, as well as its eco- 
nomic resources. He here 
called attention to the fre- 
quent recurrence of the same 
formation, or series of for- 
mations, met with in cross- 
ing East Tennessee, and 
accounted for the phenom- 
ena on the theory that the 
bed had been thrown into a 
series of parallel and closely 
compressed and overturned 
folds, the crests of which had 
been subsequently denuded 
(see p. 488). 

Although on his map a section of the Ocoee conglomerate was put 
down as belonging at the top of the Azoic series, in his chapter on the 
Potsdam group it was stated that the Ocoee conglomerate and slates, 
Chilhowee sandstones, and Knox group of shales, dolomites, and lime- 
stones might be regarded as a formation which corresponds to Dana's 
Potsdam period, and that it was not easy to separate, lithologically, 
the Ocoee subgroup from the Chilhowee, as they often run into each 
other. 

The main bulk of the report was given up to a discussion of the 
distribution, lithological nature, and characteristic fossils of the vari- 
ous formations. He was disposed to regard the Porter's Creek group

and

of the Tertiary as distinct from the Orange sand, this latter name 
having been originally provisionally applied by him to a series of 
strata which he regarded as, for the most part, equivalent to Hilgard' s 
northern lignitic. The general grouping of the formations, from the 
Cretaceous upward, was essentially the same as had been given by 
him in a previous paper in the American Journal of Science (1861), 
and which is as follows, beginning at the bottom: 

1. Coffee sand Cretaceous. 

2. Green sand or the shell bed Cretaceous. 

8. Ripley group (provisional ) Cretaceous. 

4. Porter's Creek group (provisional) Tertiary (?) 

5. Orange sand or Lagrange group Tertiary. 

6. Bluff lignite (provisional) Tertiary (?) 

7. Bluff gravel Post-Tertiary. 

8. Bluff loam '. Post-Tertiary. 

9. Bottom alluvium Modern. 

Fifteen new species of invertebrate fossils were described. The 
work does not seem to have attracted much attention at the time, and 
was given but a half-page review in the American Journal of Science 
for that year. In this, attention was merely called to the fact that Saf- 
ford differed with Hilgard on the question of the age of the Orange 
sand. 

In 1869 E. W. Hilgard, acting under the auspices of the New Orleans 
Academy of Sciences, made a reconnaissance of Louisiana, a summary 
of the results of which was published in the American Journal of Sci- 
ence for 1869. The expense of the trip was paid partly 
LouUifna .^s^. 111 by subscription and partly by an appropriation by the 
State Board of Immigration, and the time limited to 
thirt} 7 days. The journey (some 625 miles) was made mainly on horse- 
back, passing Petite Anse and New Iberia on the Teche by way of 
Opelousas to Bayou Chicot; thence to the Calcasieu River, down that 
stream to Lake Charles and the sulphur and petroleum wells, on the 
West Fork of the Calcasieu River; thence north to Sabine Town, Texas; 
thence by way of Many to Mansfield, Louisiana; thence, crossing Red 
River at Coushatta Chute landing to the salines on Saline Bayou, and 
thence, by wa} T of Winnfield and Harrisonburg on the Ouachita River, 
where the expedition terminated. Among the more striking results 
announced was the fact that the Gulf coast has in late Quaternary 
times suffered a depression to the extent of at least 900 feet, and dur- 
ing the Terrace epoch a contrary motion to the extent of about half 
that amount. The occurrence of sulphur and gypsum beds was also 
noted. The various formations were described as: The Port Hudson 
group, the Orange sand formation, the Grand Gulf formation, the 
Vicksburg group, and the Mansfield group. 

In 1869 the geological survey of Michigan, which had been brought 
to a close in 1861 by the outbreak of the civil war, was resuscitated

throughran act of the legislature, establishing ;i board of survey, con- 
sisting- of the governor of the State, the president of the board of 
education, and the superintendent of public instruction, with power 
to select geologists, disburse the money appropriated,

Prof. Alexander Winchell was again made director, and 
undertook himself the investigation of the Lower Peninsula, with the 
assistance of his brother N. II. Winchell, M. W. Harrington, E. A. 
Strong, A. M. Wadsworth, C. B. Headley, A. O. Currier, and J. H. 
Emerson. Later (1873-1876), after Winchell's retirement, C. Romin- 
ger was appointed by the board to work on the Lower Peninsula also. 

To Maj. T. B. Brooks, as a State geologist, was assigned the survey 
of the iron regions; to Raphael Pumpelly that of the copper regions 
of the Upper Peninsula, and to Carl Rominger a study of the Paleozoic 
rocks and their associated fossils. Brooks's report, submitted in 1873 
and forming part one of the first volume of the reports of this survey, 
was written with the idea of making it "as complete a manual as pos- 
sible of information relating to the finding, extracting, transporting, 
and smelting of the iron ores of the Lake Superior region. " With 
this in view, he presented in the order here given, first, an historical 
sketch of the discovery and development of the iron mines; second, 
the geology of the Upper Peninsula, including the lithology; third, 
the geology of the Marquette iron region; fourth, the geology of the 
Menominee iron region; fifth, the Lake Gogebic and Montreal River 
iron ridge; sixth, a chapter on exploration and prospecting for ore; 
and seventh, the magnetism of rocks and use of the magnetic needle in 
exploring, concluding with chapters on the method and cost of mining 
specular and magnetic ores and the chemical composition of the ores. 

The lithological work on the rocks of the region was performed by 
A. A. Julian, of New York, his report forming the second volume 
(298 pages) of the survey. 

Brooks's work contained scarcely anything of a speculative nature 
and but little as to the origin of the ores themselves. 
Brooks's work. With reference to the association of magnetic and 
specular ores, he wrote: 

If we suppose all our ores to have been once magnetic, and that the red specular 
was first derived from the magnetite and the hydrated oxide (soft hematites) in turn 
from it, we have an hypothesis which best explains many facts and will he of use to 
the explorer. 

Again, with reference to the ore of the Negaunee district: 

If we suppose tepid alkaline waters to have permeated this formation and to have 
dissolved out the greater portion of the siliceous matter, leaving the iron oxide in 
an hydrated earthy condition, we would have the essential character exhibited by 
this formation as developed on the New England, Saginaw range, and, as will be 
seen afterward, at the Lake Superior mine. This is offered not so much as an 
hypothesis to account for the difference as to illustrate the facts observed. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DEOADK OF 1860-1869.

This view, so modestly put, contains in it, however, the germ of 
the conclusions arrived at. by Van Hise some twenty-five years later." 

He noted the monoclinal character of the deposit at the Washington 
mine property in the Marquette region, and described the ore of the 
Lake Superior specular and hematite workings and the Barnum mine 
as occupying the position of "the frustum of a hollow cone lying 
with its axis horizontal and its small end toward the east, 1 ' which had 
been cut in two by a horizontal plane representing the surface of the 
ground. 

Other points, which it is well to note, since Rominger in his later 
report had occasion to disagree with him, are his regarding the ores 
of the Cascade Range as the equivalent of the Michigan and magnetic 
ores of the Mishigaini district and as older than any of the iron beds 
in the Republic Mountain series; and, sec- 
ond, the Felch Mountain ore deposit as lie- 
longing to the lower quartzite, the ore itself 
resting immediately upon and being bounded 
on the south by hornblendic, micaceous, and 
gneissic rocks which are undoubtedly Lau- 
rentian. Subsequent studies by Wadsworth, 
Van Hise, and others have shown him to be 
substantially correct in both of these con- 
clusions. 

Ill health prevented Brooks from carry- 
ing out his work in as thorough a manner 
as he wished, and his letter of transmittal 
was written from London, he having gone 
abroad to recuperate. 

Brooks, as may readily be inferred, was an eminently practical man. 
Indeed, his entire training was of a practical nature, consisting of two 
years at the School of Engineering of Union College and a single 
course of lectures on geology under Lesley at the Uni- 
sketch of Brooks. versity of Pennsylvania. His early work was in con- 
nection with land surveys, but after his retirement 
from the Army in the fall of 1864 he served a year on the geological 
survey of New Jersey under Cook, and then in 1865 became vice- 
president and general manager of the Iron Cliff mine, near Negaunee, 
in the Marquette district of Michigan. Here he began that geological 
work upon which is mainly based his reputation. The difficulties 
which he encountered were such as can be scarcely comprehended by 
those who have not visited the region. The country was, much of it, 
heavily forested and swampy as well. Outcrops were few and perhaps 
wholly obscured by the drift or by undergrowth. There were no maps.

roads, and transportation was limited to canoes and pack animals. 
There were few prospect holes and fewer developed mines. To these 
difficulties were added the complications due to repeated folding- and 
squeezing which the beds had undergone. Yet Brooks, by his per- 
sistency and originality in methods, succeeded in producing a work 
of value as a scientific production as well as of the greatest use to the 
prospector — a rare combination, indeed — and a work which has been 
superseded only by one that it took twenty years of study by an able 
corps of geologists and a hundredfold better facilities to produce. 

Brooks devised the dial compass and adapted the dip needle to the 
purposes of the prospector. Persistent and determined to succeed in 
spite of the poverty of appropriations, he expended over $2,000 of his 
own means and, worst of all, sapped his own vitality in the work to the 
extent that he became a confirmed invalid before reaching middle age. 

As already intimated, his health gave out in 1873 and he sought 
relief abroad, residing in London and Dresden, where his reports were 
completed. After his return to this country in 1876, he resided at 
Monroe and Newburgh, New York, and after 1883, during the winters, 
at Bainbridge, Georgia, living the life of a country gentleman and 
farmer.

'" ^"ch'gan, a g e anc l lithological nature of the copper-bearing rocks. 

The conclusions at which he arrived were as follows: 

First, the cupriferous series was formed before the tilting of the Huronian beds 
upon which it rests conformably, and consequently before the elevation of the great 
Azc lie area, whose existence during the Potsdam period predetermined the Silurian 
basins of Michigan and Lake Superior. Second, after the elevation of these rocks 
and after they had assumed their essential lithological characteristics, came the depo- 
sition of the sandstone and its accompanying shales, as products of the erosion of 
these older rocks, and containing fossils which show them to belong to the Lower 
Silurian, though it is still uncertain whether they should be referred to the Potsdam, 
Calciferous, or Chazy. 

A chapter was given on the paragenesis of copper and its associates. 
With reference to these subjects he wrote: 

It is still an open question whether the trap which formed the parent rock of the 
melaphyr was an eruptive or a purely metamorphic rock. If it was eruptive, it was 
spread over the bottom of the sea in beds of great regularity and with intervals which 
were occupied by the deposition of the beds of conglomerate and sandstones. It 
should seem probable that the copper in the melaphyrs was derived by concentra- 
tion from the whole thickness of the sedimentary members of the group, including 
the thousands of feet of sandstones, conglomerates, and shales which overlie the 
melaphyrs, and including melaphyrs also. 

The translocation he regarded as having been initiated by the sul- 
phate of copper resulting from the oxidation of the sulphide, but as

this salt must have been soon decomposed by the abundant acid car- 
bonate of lime, he could not suppose it to have been effectual in the 
final concentration of the large deposits, and he thought it more prob- 
able that this last was accomplished by the more permanent solution 
of carbonate and silicate of copper.

Rominger's report on the Paleozoic rocks of the Upper Peninsula 

formed part 3 of the third volume of the Survey reports (1873). His 

second appeared in 1876, forming one of the four large octavo volumes 

of the Survey, comprising altogether some 386 pages,

in Michigan, 1873- with oo plates of fossils, and a colored geological map 
of the area surveyed. The geological portion contains 
a record of the characteristic rocks, their geographical distribution, 
and the fossils they contain. It is to be noted that Rominger showed 
a disposition to disagree in many of his conclusions with Winchell, 
Brooks, and others who had preceded him. 

The presence of large bowlders in the midst or on top of well-stratified 
drift layers he conceived to be due to the transportation of the material 
by means of swimming icebergs during periods of flood. In this he 
agreed, substantially, with Dawson, of the Canadian Survey. The 
dolomites of the Ida quarries, which Winchell identified as belonging 
with the Onondaga salt group (Upper Silurian), he considered as Upper 
Helderberg (Middle Devonian), and he stated that the mapping b}^ 
Winchell of Upper Helderberg rocks throughout a great portion of 
Cass, Van Buren, and all over Berrien County, was an error. He also 
differed with Winchell regarding the stratigraphic position of the 
Hamilton rocks of Big Traverse Bay. Winchell's Huron shales he 
considered from paleontological evidence, to be identical with the 
Cuyahoga shales of the Ohio geologists, and, therefore, belonging to 
the lower part of the Carboniferous rather than the Upper Devonian. 
He also accused Winchell of a peculiar stratigraphic blunder in pre- 
paring a section west of Flat Rock: 

Unfortunately this section is laid across a synclinal undulation of the formation, 
and begins at one end with the same rock beds (Marshall sandstone), which on the 
other end are found very near the base. Under the impression that he was all the 
while descending, he stands again on the horizon from which he started. 

The salt brines of the State, according to Rominger, are derived 
from rocks of the Waverly group, and not from those of a higher 
horizon, which Winchell had designated as the Michigan salt group. 

Rominger also made reports on soils, building stones, and slate 
quarries, and on the Ontonagon silver mining district. What is per- 
haps the most valuable part of the report is that relating to the fossil 
corals- which was. for its time, unsurpassed.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



Subsequently (1881) Rominger, still acting as a State geologist 
(18T8-1880), issued a report on the Upper Peninsula, which dealt 
almost entirely with the economic problems of the iron region. 

He regarded the region about Marquette as — 

a synclinal trough of granite which, by the upheaval of its northern and southern 
margins, caused the inclpsure of the incumbent sedimentary strata between its walls 
and their simultaneous uplift and corrugations into parallel folds by the lateral 
pressure from its rising and approaching edges. 

Concerning the origin of the iron ores of the Upper Peninsula, he 
wrote: 

These ore deposits are not regular sedimentary layers originally formed of iron 
oxide in a state of purity, but are evidently the product of decomposition of the 
impurer mixed ferruginous ledges by percolating water, leaching out the siliceous 
matter and replacing it by the deposition of oxide of iron held in solution. 

This view is not greatly different from the conclusion reached b} T 

Brooks, as already noted, and subsequently 
by Van Hise. 

His views as to the origin of serpentinous 
rocks were not at all (dear. Writing with 
particular reference to those of Presque 
Isle, he remarked that they occur — 

generally in bulky, nonstratified masses which, if 
they ever originated from mechanical sedimentary 
deposits, are by chemical action so completely trans- 
formed as to efface all traces of their former detrital 
structure. They resemble volcanic eruptive rocks 
forced to the surface in a soft, plastic condition, and 
most likely heat was one of the prime agents in their 
formation, or else transformation, in combination 
Pig. si.— Carl Rominger. with aqueous vapors. 

Rominger, in his first report, that on the Paleozoic rocks of the 
copper district, took the ground that the Silurian age of the Lake 
Superior sandstone was unequivocally proved by its stratigraphical 
position. This is the view now generally held, though the Potsdam 
period, to which the beds are referred, is now considered as the upper 
part of the Cambrian instead of the Lower Silurian, as at that date. 

Rominger's career, like that of Lesquereux and others that might 

be mentioned, offers an interesting illustration of the 

sketch of Rominger. difficulties with which the early naturalists had to 

contend, particularly when foreigners and but little 

acquainted with the language of their adopted country. 

Born in Wurtemberg, he came to America in 1848 on account of revo- 
lutionary disturbances, and without previous preparation. Though 
trained as a physician and geologist, yet his poor command of Eng- 
lish he felt excluded him from associating with scientific men, and, 
being without financial resources, he established himself as a physi-

cian in Cincinnati, a city containing a large German population, 
Hero he remained for twenty-five years, improving himself in the 
language and devoting what time could lie spared from his profes- 
sional duties to the study of paleontology and geology. In L870, 
through the influence of James Hall and others, he was appointed one 
of the geologists of the Michigan survey under Winchell, ultimately 
himself becoming director, in which position he remained until 1883, 
when, under a new administration, he was removed to make room 
for another. 

His bibliography, although not numerous, is important, particularly 
that relating to paleontological matters. It had been his intention to 
continue his w r ork on the fossil corals, but the political changes above 
mentioned prevented. The edition of his work issued by the State 
being insufficient to supply the demand, Rominger had printed 250 
copies at a personal expense of $4.75 each, hoping to be able to sell 
them at least for the same figure. But this proved impossible, and he 
suffered a direct loss thereby of not less than $800. 

A second geological survey of Ohio was inaugurated in 1869, and 
J. S. Newberry appointed chief geologist. This survey was continued 
in operation until 1878, when it was discontinued, owing to a disagree- 
ment between Dr. Newberry and the legislature (see 
rfoJCTsS^s. P- 481 )> b - v withholding the appropriations. 

During the period of its existence two annual reports 
and four volumes of a final report were published, the latest bearing 
on the title-page the date of 1882. Of these the first volume was 
given up to geology," the second and third to paleontology, and the 
fourth to zoology and botany. The first volume w r as, however, issued 
in two parts, of which Part I only was strictly geological, and Part II 
paleontological. A third paleontological volume to be devoted to the 
Carboniferous flora was projected but never appeared, owing to failure 
of the legislature to make the necessary appropriations. 

Newbeny's principal assistants in 186H were E. B. Andrews, Edward 
Orton (who afterwards became State geologist), and John H. Klippart. 
In 1870 the force was increased by the emplo3 T ment of T. G. Wormley 
as chemist, and G. K. Gilbert, M. C. Read, Henry Newton, and W. B. 
Potter as local assistants. As one of the results of their investigations 
it was announced that the so-called Cliff limestone had been resolved 
into seven distinct formations belonging to the two great geological 
systems — the Devonian and Upper Silurian. The discovery of Oriskany 
sandstone in the northwest quarter of the State w r as announced and 
the Carboniferous age of the rocks of the Waverly group thought to 
have been established on paleontological evidence. This has. however. 
been since shown to be erroneous. 



"An edition of 2,000 copies of this report was printed in the German language, as 
were also the annual reports of Rogers's Survey of Pennsylvania. 



542 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Beginning with the later Tertiary times, the following sequence of 
events was established: 

(a) In the Miocene and Pliocene epochs a continent several hundred 
feet lower than now, the ocean reaching to Louisville and Iowa, with 
a\subtropical climate prevailing over the lake region, the climate of 
Greenland and Alaska being as mild as that of southern Ohio is now, 
while herds of gigantic mammals ranged over the plains. 

(h) A preglacial epoch of gradual continental elevation which cul- 
minated in the glacial epoch, when the climate of Ohio was similar to 
that of Greenland at present, and glaciers covered a large part of the 
surface down to the parallel of forty degrees. 

(c) This period was followed by another interval of continental sub- 
sidence characterized by a warmer climate and melting of the glaciers 
and by inland fresh-water seas tilling the lake basin, and in which 
were deposited the Erie and Cham plain cla}^s, sands, and bowlders. 

{(I) Another epoch of elevation which is still in progress. 

Much attention was given to economic geology and the study of the 
coal beds. From analyses it was shown that the change from woody 
tissues to peat or lignite, and thence to bituminous and anthracite coal 
and plumbago consisted in the evolution of a portion of the carbon, 
hydrogen, and oxygen, leaving a constantly increasing percentage of 
carbon behind. This evolution Newberry conceived to be due to the 
disturbances which resulted in the uplifting of the mountain chains 
and metamorphosed the included rocks. 

The coal beds of Ohio, it should be noted, were considered as 
always having been separated from those of Illinois b} T the Cincin- 
nati anticline. This Cincinnati uplift or arch was, in the report for 
1869, regarded as having formed a land surface over a considerable 
portion of its length at least during the earlier and probably through- 
out all the Devonian ages. Later, in discussing the work of Orton 
in Adams County, Newberry wrote: 

Here we have an indubitable record of the elevation of the Cincinnati arch between 
the Upper and Lower Silurian ages, and proof that it in far older than the Appala- 
chian system, with which it haw been commonly associated. 

The carbonaceous matter of the Huron shales was suggested as 
probably due to an abundance of seaweeds which flourished in a kind 
of Saragossa sea which occupied that region during the period of 
deposition. 

The petroleum and gas tilling the cavities and interstices in the 
sandstones and conglomerates in the Oil Creek region were regarded 
as not indigenous to those rocks, but rather as originating in the 
lower-lying Huronian shales, from whence they had been forced 
upward by hydrostatic pressure. 

The dolomitic character of the rocks of the Clinton, Niagara, and 
Water-lime series was ascribed to u a vital rather than a chemical or

physical cause," and the occurrence of a large percentage of magnesia 
in the hard parts of some groups of marine invertebrates, as the Milli- 
pores, cited as a possible explanation of the origin of the rock, in this 
following a suggestion made by Dana in the report of the Wilkes 
Exploring Expedition. 

The sheet of clay and bowlders which was found directly overlying; 
the polished surface of the rocks over so large a part of the State, and 
which is now known as till and bowlder clay, was described under the 
name of glacial drift, while the loose bowlders which are indiscrimi- 
nately scattered over the State, frequently resting on the fine strati- 
fied clays, were known under the name of "iceberg drift." 

Newberry conceived that, during the latter part of the glacial period, 
a great inland sea of fresh water filled the basins before occupied by ice, 
the northern shore of which was formed by the ice wall at the foot of 
the glacier. The mud which was brought into this lake through the 
grinding action of the glacier and there de- 
posited formed the so-called Erie clays". 

For the rocks of the so-called olue lime- 
stone series of the early geological surveys 
he adopted the name Cincinnati group, as 
first applied by Meek and Worthen. The 
gypsum of the Salina group was regarded as 
precipitated in continuous sheets and not to 
have resulted from a change in the ordinary 
limestones b}^ sulphuric acid, its had been 
claimed for the gypsum beds of New York. 
This is the view now commonly accepted. 

It appears that Colonel Whittlesey was 
an aspirant for the position of State geolo- 
gist at the time of Newbeny's appointment, 

and to judge from the tone of an article by Newberry published in the 

Cincinnati Commercial, a adopted rather unfair means to throw discredit 

upon the latter's work. In his reply Newberrv was

own qualifications for the work, W hittlesey was too old 
and in too poor health to do good work, and also that he was not a good 
geologist; that, further, he held to certain geological heresies which 
would impair his work; that he believed in the mineral origin of coal, 
and that the brown hematite ores of the Alleghenies were interstratified 
with the limestones instead of being mere pockets. He further claimed 
that Whittlesey was no paleontologist, and without paleontology no 
man could be a good geologist. As an illustration of his deficiency 
in this respect, Newberry referred to his (Whittlesey's) paper on the

544 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Equivalency of the Rocks of Northeastern Ohio, in which lie identified 
certain rocks as equivalent with the Chemung-, Portage, and Hamilton 
groups, of New York, on paleontological grounds, whereas in fact 
every one of the twelve specjes of fossils on which this identification 
was based was wrongly named, the fossils actually being wholly of 
Carboniferous age. 

Dr. E. Andrews, who was one of Newbeny's assistants on the Ohio 

geological survey, in the American Journal of Science for 1869, wrote 

on the western bowlder drift, and took the ground that the fresh-water 

submergence which deposited the loess was not a con- 

Andrews's Views on 

the Glacial Drift, tinuatioii of the drift action, but was in that region 
separated from it by a tranquil period during which 
the rivers were down within their banks. As a whole, the western 
drift was, he thought — 

beyond all question a stratified water deposit. A study of the cliffs eroded by the 
lakes, showing both modified and unmodified drift, has obliged those western geolo- 
gists most familiar with the sections to abandon the glacial theory and admit that 
the bowlder drift < >f this region is altogether an aqueous deposit, though the waters 
floated vast quantities of ice. 

He described the occurrence of bowlders of loose gravel, sometimes 
3 feet in diameter, in the clay passed through in digging the tunnel 
under the lake for the Chicago waterworks extension. Such he 
regarded as masses of frozen gravel dropped from floating ice. With 
reference to the gravel deposits on the peninsula between Green Bay 
and Lake Michigan, covering an area of 4,000 square miles, he 
wrote: 

The stratified character of the gravel * * * is on the whole too evident to 
admit of any possible doubt. * * * It would seem to be an unavoidable infer- 
ence that our drift of this region not only came from the north, but it came in a 
vast sweep of water deep enough to cover gravel hills more than 800 feet high, and 
with velocity enough to throw such coarse material into lofty steeps and summits. 

Again, concerning the absence of drift on the north slope of the 
Laurentian hills and the scratched and "pounded" aspect of the 
region, he wrote: 

We seem, therefore, to have testimony that the drift action for a thousand miles 
cast and west along the Laurentian crest and to an unknown distance north of it 
was too violent to admit of drift deposits, even the bowlders being swept off. 

The liner character of the material in northern and central Illinois 
he thought to be due to the less violent rush of the waters. These 
waters he imagined to have been drawn off suddenly after the depo- 
sition of the Orange loam, thus accounting for the absence of beach 
lines. 

These views are not quite those of Newberry himself, as expressed 
in a paper before the New York Lyceum in 1870. From facts observed 
in the basin of the Great Lakes and the Valley of the Mississippi, he 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1860-1869. 545 

argued that, synchronously with the glacial epoch of Europe, the 
northern half of North America had a climate comparable with that of 
Greenland, and that, as a result, glaciers were formed, 
onThe Dnft V i'870 S the direction of flow of which corresponded in a gen- 
eral way with the present drainage channels. The 
Lower Mississippi he looked upon as a " half -drowned river " — that is, 
one with its lower channel deeply submerged and silted up, an unmis- 
takable proof that at that period the country stood at a considerably 
greater elevation than at present. 

The trough of the Mississippi, to his mind, was simply a valley of 
erosion which, since the close of the Carboniferous period, had been 
traversed by a river which drained the area of the northern Mississippi, 
the Ohio, and the Tennessee, and, since the Miocene period, the Mis- 
souri, Arkansas, and the Red rivers as well. Through alternate eleva- 
tion and depression the mouth of the stream had varied its position 
from time to time to the amount of a thousand miles, the final long- 
continued depression being the primary cause of the climatic amelio- 
ration which brought the glacial period to an end. 

The fine blue-gray and highly plastic so-called Erie clays and their 
accompanying sands and bowlders were to him due to floating icebergs 
during a period of continental depression and great inland seas. 
deposited, in fact, just as similar materials are conceived as now being 
scattered over the sea bottoms about Newfoundland." 

If we restore in imagination this inland sea, which we have proved once filled the 
basin of the lakes, gradually displacing the retreating glaciers, we are inevitably led 
to a time in the history of this region when the southern shore of this sea was formed 
by the highlands of Ohio, etc., the northern shore a wall of ice resting on the hills 
of crystalline and trappean rocks about Lake Superior and Lake Huron. 

From this ice wall masses must from time to time have been detached, just as they 
are now detached from the Humboldt glacier, and floated off southward with the 
current, bearing in their grasp sand, gravel, and bowlders — whatever composed the 
beach from which they sailed. Five hundred miles south they grounded upon the 
southern shore — the highlands of now western New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, 
or the shallows of the prairie region of Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa. There melting 
away and depositing their entire loads, as I have sometimes seen them, a thousand 
or more bowlders on a few acres, resting on the Erie clays and looking in the distance 
like flocks of sheep, or dropping here and there a stone and floating on east or west 
till wholly dissipated. 

The loess, as one would naturally expect from the foregoing, was 
looked upon as the finer sediment deposited in the quiet waters of one 
of these inland seas, to which the icebergs had no access. The lake 
basins, with the exception of that of Lake Superior, which is a syn- 
clinal trough, were regarded as excavated by glacial action and once 
much deeper than now, having become partially filled with drift 
deposits as the}^ gradually emerged. Temporary pauses in the period 
of uplift would give time for wave action, and thus would be formed 
the terraces and ancient beaches so commonly found in the lake regions.

546 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Newberry was succeeded as State geologist by Edward Orton, who 
had previously acted as chief assistant. During Orton's administra- 
tion certain "pardonable errors in identification," which left the stratig- 
raphy of the coal series of Ohio in an almost hopeless 

Orton's Appointment x , „ , , , . ,. , 

as state (Geologist, tangle, were corrected. He showed the stratigraphical 
order of the lower Coal Measures of Ohio to be com- 
pletely in harmony with that of Pennsylvania and thiit the entire series 
could be traced from the eastern margin of the State clear across the 
same to Kentucky. This is regarded by White, Orton's biographer, 
as the masterpiece of Doctor Orton's purely geological work, although 
his contributions to the geology of petroleum and natural gas in the 
sixth volume, 1888, are of almost equal importance. 

Orton's work during his whole life was largely of an economic char- 
acter, the more important and comprehensive publications being Vol- 
umes V (1884) and VI (1888) on the Economic Geology of Ohio, his 
Report on Petroleum and Gas in Ohio (1890), and the Report on the 
Occurrence of Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Asphalt Rock in West- 
ern Kentucky (1891). He also had an important paper on the Trenton 
limestone as a source of petroleum and inflammable gas in Ohio and 
Indiana, in the Eighth Annual Report of the IT. S. Geological Survey 
(1886-87). Aside from his record as president of the university and 
a teacher, Orton will be best remembered for his work on the sub- 
jects of gas and petroleum, although in his report on the third geo- 
logical district he makes important observations on the Cincinnati 
uplift or axis, showing it to have been a slow and gradual formation 
resulting in a gentle flexure in the earth's crust involving the Lower 
and Upper Silurian and, to some extent, the Devonian formations of 
the State. In his own words, his conclusion's were as follows: 

First, the Cincinnati axis in southern Ohio was raised above the sea at the end of 
the blue limestone period, or certainly early in the history of the Clinton epoch. 
Second, it underwent various oscillations, but the elevatory movements succeeded 
those of depression. Third, the rate of movement was exceedingly slow. 

His views on the glacial period, expressed briefly and in his own 
words, were as follows: 

The following threefold divisions of glacial time may be considered as demon- 
strated: First, an age of general elevation of northern land accompanied by intense 
cold and the formation of extensive continental glaciers. Second, a general depres- 
sion of the land with the return of a milder climate. Third, a partial reelevation 
of the land and a partial return of the cold climate, producing local glaciers and 
icebergs. 

Orton was born in Delaware County, New York, and educated at 
Hamilton College, graduating in 1850. He subsequently studied 
at Harvard and then entered the Andover Theological Seminary, 
being licensed to preach in 1855, and soon after ordained as pastor 
of the Presbyterian Church at Downsville, Delaware County, New 
York. He resigned this position in order that he might accept that

of professor of natural sciences in the New York State Normal School 
at Albany. Becoming convinced, however, that his gradually chang- 
ing views on religious matters were such that he 
sketch of orton. could not conscientiously continue to hold this posi- 
tion, he resigned it, and accepted the principalship 
of an academy at Chester, in Orange County, the same State. 

In 1865 he became principal of the preparatory department of 
Antioch College in Ohio, then professor of natural sciences, and 
afterwards president of the same institution. 

His active work as a geologist received its first recognition in 1869, 
when he was appointed Newberry's assistant. In 1873 he was made 
president of the new Agricultural and Mechanical College, founded 
under the Morrill act, and also took charge of the chair of geology in 
the same institution. Under his efficient administration, which lasted 
until 1881, the institution prospered and tinally developed into the 
Ohio State University. 

In 1882, after his voluntary retirement from the State University, 
the geological survey was organized and Orton made State geologist, 
a position he continued to hold until the time of his death in 1899. 

Orton belonged to the generation beginning work immediately after 
the civil war and, according to his biographer, always leaned toward 
the application of the science to the benefit of his fellow men. "He 
was painstaking and exact in observation, scrupulous in statement, 
cautious in speculation." He was one of the first to recognize the 
possibility of the exhaustion of the supply of petroleum and natural 
gas, and to issue appeals to the people of Ohio, urging care in hus- 
banding their resources. Hut these were not received in the spirit in 
which they were offered, and he had the melancholy satisfaction of 
seeing his forebodings justified by the event. 

By those who knew him Orton will be remembered as always a man 
of perfect courtesy, dignified, a little stately, and never effusive. His 
life was full of considerate and helpful kindness —modest and retiring 
to an unusual degree, and yet one of the few men to whom honors 
come notwithstanding. In 1891 he suffered from a paralytic stroke 
which cost him the entire loss of the use of the left hand, yet he con- 
tinued to teach and to work until almost the last hour of his lite. For 
eight years he had looked upon death as a thing momentarily to Vie 
expected. He met it bravely, cheerfully, and fearlessly on October 
1<», 1899. 

In 1869 the fourth attempt at a systematic geological survey of 
Indiana was made, the appointment as State geologist going this time 
to E. T. Cox, heretofore known to geological fame only through his 
work while assistant to Owen in Kentucky and Arkansas in 1856-1860. 

Annual reports were issued for each of the ten years which marked 
the life of this survey. Those of 1869 and 1872 were accompanied

was furnished. A colored section across the State from Greencastle 
to Terre Haute accompanied the report for 1869. 

Cox was assisted during the entire or a part of the time b} r Frank H.

J. M. Coulter, and J. Schenk. 

These reports as a whole contained little new or impressive. In the 
eighth, which was the most comprehensive thus far issued, Cox him- 
self culled attention to the fact that the geological history of the State 
"appears tame and devoid of the marvelous interest which attaches to 
many other regions, and that there is not a single true fault or upward 

or downward break or displacement of the 
strata thus far discovered.'"' The oldest 
rocks of the State were found in the south- 
ern portion, extending from the Ohio River 
near the mouth of Fourteen Mile Creek to 
the eastern boundary line. These are the 
so-called Hudson River rocks of Hall, which 
Cox correlated with SaU'orcl's Nashville 
group, and which Worthen and Meek had 
included under the name of Cincinnati 
group. He regarded the Silurian strata as 
uplifted, not by a local disturbance, but " by 
an elevating force that acted very slowly 
and extending over the entire central area 
of the United States. " The seat of greatest 
force, he thought, however, was not limited to southwestern Ohio, 
but was to be looked for in Kentucl^y. 

Cox accepted the general theory of glacial drift as at present under- 
stood, and conceived that the climatic changes might be due to the 
relative position of land and water, possibly a change in the course of 
the Gulf Stream. He could find no evidence of a subsidence of the 
land to terminate the glacial period, nor could he find in Ohio, Indi- 
ana, or Illinois anything to militate against the commencement of a 
glacial period in Tertiary times and its continuation — 
until brought to a close by its own erosive force, aided by atmospheric and meteoro- 
logical conditions. By these combined agencies acting through time the mountain 
home of the glacier was cut down and a general leveling of the land took place. 

This suggestion that the glacial epoch worked out its own destruc- 
tion through a process of leveling, whereby the altitudes which gave 
it birth were so far reduced that glaciers could no longer exist, is 
unique and, so far as the present writer is aware, original with Cox.

Upon the recommendation of Logan, Dr. A. R. C. Selwyn, an Eng- 
lishman, for several years connected with, the geological survey of 
( J reat Britain under De la Beche, and from 1852 until 1869 director of 
the geological' survey of Victoria, Australia, was. upon 
under seiwyn, the retirement of the tirst named, made director of the 

geological survey of Canada. In this capacity Selwyn 
served for twenty-five years, or until 1894. He was assisted by 
II. H. Ami, Elkanah Billings, and J. F. Whiteaves. paleontologists; 
Robert Bell, George M. Dawson, James Richardson, and J. B. Tyr- 
rell, geologists, and B. J. Harrington and T. Sterry Hunt, chemists. 
With this efficient corps the work of the sur- 
vey was pushed vigorously, hut, extending 
as it did beyond the time limits laid down 
for this sketch, it can be touched upon but 
briefly. 

During the period of his administration 
twenty large annual reports were issued and 
nine volumes on paleontology and paleo- 
botany. The work of the survey was pushed 
westward as far as British Columbia, and 
though ever with economic ends in view, 
much was accomplished in the wa}^ of pure 
science. The gold fields of Nova Scotia 
were investigated and the silver deposits of 
Thunder Bay, on Lake Superior. The 
stratigraphic problems involved in Logan's "Quebec group" also 
received attention. His aim from the start, as stated by one of his 
biographers, was to make the survey an eminently practical depart- 
ment in which the records of the mines and mineral statistics should 
be kept for the use of both the Parliament and the public. 

Selwyn is pictured to us as a scholar of rare ability, social, amiable, 
and chivalrous in private life, but a strict disciplinarian; tall, grace- 
ful, quick, and alert, of a rather highstrung and nervous disposition, 
and with a keen and observant eye. His bibliography consists mainly 
of short papers and summaries published in connection with his official 
reports.

CHAPTER VII. 

THE ERA OF NATIONAL SURVEYS OR FIFTH ERA OF STATE 
SURVEYS, 1870-1879. 

The period of the civil war had brought to light a considerable 
number of men for whom the piping- times of peace, even when varied 
by Indian outbreaks in the West, afforded insufficient opportunities. 
They were men in whom the times had developed a power of organ- 
ization and command. They were, moreover, men of courage to the 
point of daring. It was but natural, therefore, particularly when the 
necessity for military routes in the West and public land questions 
were taken into consideration, that such should turn their attention 
toward western exploration. Further, the surveys made in the third 
decade, in connection with routes for the Pacific railroads, and the 
work done by Evans, Hayden, and Meek in the Bad Lands of the Mis- 
souri, had whetted the desires of numerous investigators. Willing- 
workers were abundant and Congress not difficult to persuade into 
granting the necessary funds. Hence expedition after expedition was 
organized and sent out, some purely military, some military and geo- 
graphic, with geology only incidental, and others for the avowed pur- 
pose of geological research. 

Under such conditions was inaugurated the work which culminated, 
in 1 8 T i » , in the organization of the present I T . S. Geological Survey, 
which, for breadth of scope and financial resources, is without coun- 
terpart in the world's history of science. 

The more important of the expeditions above referred to, as will be 
seen, were Hay den's Geological Surveys of the Territories; King's 
Geological Survey of the Fortieth Parallel; Powell's Surve} T s of the 
Grand Canyon of the Colorado and adjacent regions; and Wheeler's 
Geographical Surveys West of the One-hundredth Meridian. 

These expeditions demanded men in the prime of life and bodily 
vigor — men who could endure exposure and fatigue and, if necessary, 
face danger. It is a natural consequence that there should be found 
among the workers many names and faces which have not heretofore 
appeared in our chronicles. Among those who appear now, if not for 
the first time, at least for the first time prominently, mention may be 
made of C. E. Button, S. F. Emmons, G. K. Gilbert, Arnold Hague, 
W. H. Holmes, Clarence King, O. C. Marsh. A. R. Marvine, A. C. 
Peale, J. W. Powell, I. C. Russell, Orestes St. John, J. J. Stevenson, 
and R. P. Whitfield.

Fio. 85.— George Little. 



Although this was a period of great aetivit} r on the part of the Gen- 
eral Government, State and provincial governments were by no means 
quiescent. Important work was being done by T. C. Chamberlin in 

Wisconsin, J. W. Dawson in Nova Scotia, 
W. C. Kerr in North Carolina, Eugene A. 
Smith in Alabama, and J. D. Whitney in 
Cal if ornia. There were also organized a sec- 
ond geological survey of Pennsylvania, with 
J. P. Lesle}' at its head, and a geological 
and natural history survey of Minnesota, 
under N. H. Winchell. Both of these last- 
named organizations continued their work 
beyond the period of the limit set for this 
history. An attempt at establishing a geo- 
logical survey of Georgia in 187-A resulted in 
the appointment of George Little as State 
geologist and the subsequent issuance of two 
reports comprising altogether but 52 pages. 
In 1870 (?) John Murrish was appointed by Governor Lucius Fair- 
child, of Wisconsin, commissioner of the survey of the lead district of 
that State. Murrish was, according to his own statement, "a practical 
man" and had served an apprenticeship in the mines 
wV s r Jonsin^870 in °^ Cornwall, going through the regular course of prac- 
tical training for a miner's occupation and a miner's 
life. Under these conditions, it is perhaps scarcely just to compare 
his writings with those of men who have had better opportunities and 
training. Nevertheless, as he had to do with the survey of an 
important mining region, it is impossible to ignore the work here. 

Under the title of Report of the Geo- 
logical Survey of the Lead Regions, Mur- 
rish published his observations in the form 
of a pamphlet of 05 pages, in which he 
set forth his views of the various geolog- 
ical phenomena. He thought to have dis- 
covered that the lead-bearing fissures were 
grouped into ranges, the various ranges 
forming themselves into four well-defined 
belts running parallel to each other. The 
lead veins, according to his theories, occur- 
red along the elevation of the land running 
in a generally north-and-south direction, the 
elevation itself being "a line of physical 
disturbance." Concerning the character of 

this physical disturbance he was not perfectly clear, but he did not 
regard it as due to an active volcanic disturbance nor earthquakes in 
the ordinary meaning of tin 1 terms. 




Fig. SO. — John Murrish. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1870-1879. 553 

He described sink holes and what are evidently stylolites, the true 
character of which he did not recognize, but regarded as doubtless 
due to the same physical disturbances. The elevation referred to and 
the belts of mineral land in the district were formed, he conceived, 
from groups of fissures or faults in the Plutonic and Azoic rocks 
beneath, which were themselves produced by mechanical forces evi- 
dently generated by internal heat. Water entering between the beds 
would percolate downward through these lines of fracture, where it 
would come in contact with intensely heated matter under a pressure 
of several hundred feet of overlying rock. If the temperature was 
sufficient the water would be converted into steam or elastic vapor, 
which might possess sufficient mechanical power to bring about the 
elevation. During the early formation of the stratified rocks, partic- 
ularly the Potsdam sandstone, the resistance to this expansive force 
would be comparatively little, since vent for the steam would be easily 
found through the loosely accumulated sand; but as layer after layer 
was added to the strata and the more compact limestone began to form 
and harden above it, resistance would increase until to overcome it a 
general lifting of the strata would take place, by which escape would 
be effected through fissures in the rock along the line of those original 
faults in the Plutonic rocks below. 

A microscopic examination of the sand grains from the disintegrated 
Potsdam sandstone having revealed the crystalline nature of the gran- 
ules, due, as we now know, to the deposition of interstitial silica, he con- 
ceived, as did Whitney (p. -i6!»), that the entire deposit was of chemical 
origin. 

Supposing Iceland should be submerged to a considerable depth beneath the 
ocean, and those plains situated about 30 miles from that noted volcano Hecla, 
known now to be full of heated springs, steaming fissures, and boiling geysers, 
whose waters hold a large amount of silica in solution that is now being deposited 
on the surface around those places, were pouring their waters into the ocean above, 
should we not have there on a small scale what perhaps existed on a very large scale 
during our sandstone formation? 

Perhaps so. Who shall say \ 

Like many men of slight training, Murrish failed to give proper 
weight to the evidence gathered and was led into many errors, the 
most serious of which was that of assuming that the Lower Maghesian 
limestone might prove to be an ore-bearing stratum — this in spite of 
the opinion to the contrary held by Hall, Whitney, and others. 

During the summer of 18T0 O. C. Marsh, professor of paleontology 

in Yale College, began a series of scientific expeditions into the western 

part of the United States, having for his primary object 

Sldkion^lsVo. tne collection of vertebrate fossil remains. The results 

of these expeditions soon placed Marsh among the 

leading vertebrate paleontologists of the world.

KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



The Middle West, it should be remembered, was at that time an 
almost unknown territory, traversed by but a single railroad (the 
Union Pacific), and much of it rendered unsafe for the white man 
through roving bands of Indians, necessitating military escort in 
many instances. 

The first expedition explored the Pliocene deposits of Nebraska, the 
Miocene of northern Colorado, and the Eocene of the Bridge r Basin 
in Wyoming and the Uinta Basin of Utah. These expeditions wore 
supported largely at Professor Marsh's private expense, until- the 
organization in 1879 of the U. S. Geological Survey under Powell, 
shortly after which Marsh was appointed a United States paleontolo- 
gist, though still drawing upon his own resources when necessary or 
when, in his opinion, it became advisable in order that new discoveries 
might become immediately available. 

Under these joint agencies there was brought together the mass 

of material now forming the vertebrate 
collections at Yale University and the ex- 
tensive Marsh collection in the National 
Museum in Washington, which has formed 
the basis for the numerous monographs 
and papers included in Marsh's extensive 
bibliography. 

The most noted of his early discoveries 
was that of the toothed birds, Odontor- 
nithes (Hesperornis and Ichthyornis), which 
formed the basis of a monograph published 
in 1880. Based on later discoveries were 
his monographs on the Dinocerata and the 
extraordinary dinosauria, of which the 
Anchisaurus, Brontosaurus, Laosaurus, 
Ceratosaurus, Camptosaurus, Stegosaurus, Claosaurus, and Triceratops 
are the best known representatives. 

Marsh's connection with the United States Survey continued up to 
the time of his death, which took place in March, 1899, and much of 
his work lay beyond the time limits of this histoiy. 

In 1870 again the legislature of Missouri passed an act for the estab- 
lishment of a mining bureau, the board of control of which was to be 
composed of the governor and nine members, one from each Con- 
gressional district. Upon this board was conferred 
the power of appointing a State geologist, the choice 
for which fell upon Albert Hager, of Vermont. 
Hager's term of service was, however, short, and but one report of 
progress published, owing to a disagreement with the board. This 
report dealt largely with the condition of the survey at the time he 
took charge. It would appear that, since the suspension of Swallow's

Hager's Work in 
Missouri, 1870. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 187(1-1879. 555 

survey in 1861, the collections and other materials, the property of 
the survey, had been stored in the University building at Columbia, 
which was at one time in the possession of armed troops, and the 
materials suffered accordingly, as would naturally be expected. He 
found, however, reports of B. F. Shumard made during the work of 
Swallow's survey, in a fairly complete condition. These were on the 
counties of Crawford, Clark, Cape^ Girardeau, Phelps, Ste. Genevieve, 
Ozark, Douglas, Perry, Jefferson, Laclede, Pulaski, and Wright. 
The reports of Swallow and Meek were also in a satisfactory condi- 
tion. It is stated, too, that he obtained much material relating to the 
former surveys from Shumard and Swallow, with apparently the 
intention of editing their notes and publishing them. So far as known, 
however, nothing was done, and on March 18 the law governing the 
bureau was amended. Dr. J. G. Norwood, who with Dr. C. M. Litton 
had been one of Hager's assistants, remained temporaril} T in charge of 
the affairs of the survey from September 1, 1871, until November 
of the same year, when K. Pumpelly was placed at the head of the 
organization. Norwood, during his brief period of authority, was 
assisted by G. C. Broadhead and C. M. Litton. 

Under the management of Pumpelly there were issued in Ls73 two 
volumes of reports, the first a royal octavo of 325 pages which con- 
tained sill of the "previously unpublished material" that had been 
transmitted to him by earlier workers on the geological 
of U MissouH, iSSu* 8ur W of Missouri. This comprised the reports of 
Broadhead, Meek, and Shumard, and contained eight 
geological maps of counties and numerous sections. 

In this same year there was published, also under the supervision of 
Pumpelly, a preliminary report on the iron ores and coal fields, form- 
ing a volume of 440 pages and 190 illustrations in the text, with a large 
folio atlas of 15 sheets. Pumpelly was assisted in the preparation of 
this work by G. C. Broadhead, W. B. Potter, Adolph Schmidt, and 
C. 'I. Norwood as geologists; and Regis Chauvenet, chemist. Other 
assistance was rendered by W. E. Guy. J. R. Gage, and Jackson 
Leonard. 

In the report on the iron and coal, Pumpelly seems directly respon- 
sible only for the ideas advanced in the first 28 pages. It is worthy 
of note that even at this late date Pumpelly seems to have regarded 
the porphyries of Pilot Knob and adjacent regions as sedimentary 
rocks. He wrote: 

The porphyries are older than the Silurian and belong to the Archean (Azoic) 
formation of which they may be the youngest member in Missouri. * * They 

are stratified on an immense scale, but owing to the rarity of interstratified beds of 
other rocks the unraveling of the internal structure of the district is a difficult 
problem. 



556 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

The porphyry hills, like Pilot Knob and others, he regarded as 
Azoic rocks, the exposed portions of the skeleton of the eastern part 
of the Ozark range, rising from 300 to 1,800 feet above the level of 
the surrounding country. "They form an archipelago of islands in 
the Lower Silurian strata, which surround them as a whole and sepa- 
rate them from each other. " The rocks overlying these he regarded 
as belonging to the oldest members of the Silurian, and thought that 
they might be the deep-seated equivalents of the Potsdam sandstone, 
or even older. 

The region of these porphyries, as well as the Ozark range in gen- 
eral throughout Missouri, had, in his opinion, apparently been above 
the level of the sea from a very early period (perhaps since the Car- 
boniferous and Silurian) to the present time.' 

He recognized the fact that the surface ore at Iron Mountain was a 
residuary product resulting from the disintegration and gradual 
removal of the siliceous rocks in which the iron ore was originally 
embedded, the instance offering, as he stated, an extreme case where 
decomposition of the porphyry in mass facilitated the separation of 
the ore from the rock and the mechanical removal of the latter. 

Concerning the ultimate origin of the iron, Pumpelly was silent. 
Regarding the origin of the manganese ore as at Cuthbertsons Hill, 
in township 33, he wrote: 

It would seem that we have in these occurrences instances of replacement, but it 
is difficult to imagine a direct substitution of manganese oxides for the decomposition 
products of a porphyry, and all the more so in this case from the fact that the analysis 
shows the remaining porphyry, which is intimately associated with the ore, to have 
its normal constitution. 

He further described what he called a metaphoric limestone at Huffs, 
near Ackhursts, as — 

nearly wholly changed into a porphyry or jasper rock, it having here a schistoid 
structure in which the alternate laminae are impure, compact carbonate of lime. 
* * * Here is a member of the porphyry series which was originally, unques- 
tionably, a limestone, but in which the original physical and chemical character- 
istics have almost wholly disappeared. It should not seem impossible that the 
manganiferous rocks which have been described may have had a similar origin, and 
that the manganese and iron oxides owe their present existence to a former replace- 
ment of the lime-carbonate by iron and manganese salts. The porphyry which now 
surrounds these ores may be due to a previous, contemporaneous, or subsequent 
replacement of the lime-carbonate by silica and silicates. 

A ; 'may be" to which few would assent at this date. 

A general discussion of the iron ores and their distribution was com- 
prised in the report of Mr. Chauvenet, which occupied 192 pages of 
the entire volume. According to this writer the ores of Iron Moun- 
tain are due to deposition from solution in water which filtered into 
fissures. Adolph Schmidt regarded these same ores as replacement 
products and attempted to explain their formation as follows: When a 
solution of sulphate or chloride of iron containing also carbonic acid 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1870-1879. 557 

remains for any length of time in contact with a porphyry the latter 
will become decomposed, the alkalies being set free in the form of 
carbonates. The carbonates, reacting on the iron-bearing solutions, 
will precipitate the iron as oxides, which will fill the pores in the 
porphyry made by the removal of the alkalies. The silica set free in 
the process would be to some extent removed, but most of it would 
remain. The silicate of alumina would be decomposed by bicarbonate 
of iron in solution and removed in the form of a soluble hisilicate, as 
explained by Bischoff. It is needless to say that these views were not 
generally accepted. 

Next to Owen's Key to the Geology of the Globe, I know of no 

more extraordinary publication relating to American geology than 

that of the artist George Catlin, entitled The Lifted and Subsided 

Rocks of America, with their Influences on the ( )ceanic, 

Geology V /f70 °° Atmospheric, and Land Currents, which was published 

in London in 1870. 

One can forgive any amount of ignorance relating to tin 1 subject of 
geology in a man of Catlin's profession, but it is not so easy to forgive 
him for putting before an indiscriminating public opinions which are 
founded on wholly insufficient, and in many eases visionary, data. 

Catlin had traveled extensivehy throughout the western portions of 
North America and naturally had been attracted by the enormous 
amount of erosion and uplift manifest in a treeless area. That his 
thoughts should have been turned in this direction is not at all strange, 
but his conclusions are such as can be accounted for onh T on the 
grounds that he had received absolutely no training, had not learned 
how to observe, nor how to reason from that which he saw. 

The most striking features of the work are those relating to the 
cause of the Gulf Stream and the origin of the Gulf of Mexico. He 
conceived that from both North and South America there issued two 
large subterranean streams of water, one flowing from the north to 
the south under the main axis of the Rocky Mountains, and the other 
in an opposite direction along the main axis of the Andes. These 
becoming heated through proximity to the volcanic fires in the region 
of the equator, finally issued, giving the necessary volume and temper- 
ature to account for the Gulf Stream. 

The origin of the gulf itself he imagined to be due to an undermining 
of the crust of the earth and its subsequent falling in, through the 
solvent action of the heated water, and he figures the continent both 
before and after the catastrophe. a 

" Catlin's book was noticed in the American Journal of Science, L, 1870, and dis- 
missed with the following curt remark: "The writer of this work, well known for his 
travels among the American Indians, here treats of mountain drainage, upheavals, 
metamorphism, making of mountain chains, sinking of mountains, and of the Indian 
races of America. He presents his geological views and criticisms with great posi- 
tiveness, which is consistent with the fact of his limited knowledge of the subject." 



558 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

In 1871, Dr. F. V. Hopkins, professor of geology, chemistry, and 
mineralogy in the State University of Louisiana, issued a report on 
the geology of the State, relating particularly to the post-Tertiary 
deposits, and containing also a colored geological map. 
Qeeiogy of Louisiana, These deposits he divided into (1) Drift, (2) Port 
Hudson (so-called by Hilgard), (3) the Loess, and (4) 
the Yellow Loam, the last three being included also under the general 
name of Bluff Formation. 

Hopkins held (and Dana approved) that the Port Hudson and over- 
lying beds were deposited when the land was at a lower level than 
now, and that the loess was the accumulation over an old flood plain 
of the Mississippi, as suggested by Lyell. The drift itself, however, 
he conceived to be due to the agency of icebergs in a sea at least 1,159 
feet deep in the Ohio Valley. To this last view Dana, of course, 
objected. 

In 1872 the subject of the formation of the great features of the 

earth's surface, including, of course, the formation of mountains, was 

brought up once more by Joseph Le Conte, then professor of geology 

and natural history in the University of California. 

Le Conte's Ideas on . , . * " , 

Mountain Making, In a series of articles in the American Journal of Sci- 

1872. 

ence for this year he reviewed the ideas of Humboldt 
and others; discussed the probable condition of the earth's interior, 
whether fluidal or otherwise; and announced himself as convinced that 
the whole theory of igneous agencies, which formed the foundation of 
theoretic geology, should be reconstructed on the basis of a solid 
earth. 

On the assumption that such an earth would be not homogeneous, 
but that some areas would possess greater conductivity than others 
and would, therefore, cool and contract more rapidly in a radial direc- 
tion, he affirmed that the present sea bottoms represented the areas 
of most, and the continents and mountain ranges those of less, rapid 
cooling and contraction. This he felt was borne out by the researches 
of physicists who had shown that the continental masses were less* 
dense than suboceanic matter. 

To him the cooling earth might be regarded as composed of concen- 
tric isothermal shells, each cooling by conduction. The exterior being 
the first to cool and solidify, would, through the shrinking away of 
the still cooling interior, become subjected to powerful horizontal 
pressure or thrust, which as time went on would find relief in the 
direction of least resistance (i. e., upward) and along lines of weakness. 
It was, however, his idea that this yielding was not by upbending into 
an arch, but by a mashing or crushing together horizontally like dough 
or plastic clay, with more or less folding of the strata and an upswell- 
ing or thickening of the whole squeezed mass. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1870-1879. 559 

He showed that, were a mass of sediments 10,000 feet in thickness 
subjected to horizontal pressure and crushing sufficient to develop 
well-marked cleavage structure, a breadth of 2£ miles would be crushed 
into 1 mile, and 10,000 feet thickness would be swelled to 25,000, mak- 
ing an actual elevation of the surface of 15.000 feet. He, therefore, 
felt justified in asserting that the phenomena of plication and of slaty 
cleavage demonstrated a crushing together horizontally and an upswell- 
ingof the whole mass of sediments, the ups welling produced by this cause 
alone being sufficient to account for the elevation of the greatest moun- 
tain chains. 

Hall's theory, previously noted (p. 499), he regarded as wholly failing 
to explain the actual process by which the chains had been formed; 
and, taking into account the breadth of the Appalachians (at least 100 
miles), he showed that the gentleness of the supposed convex curve of 
Hall would not produce the amount of crushing necessary for the for- 
mation of the immense plication. 

Moreover, he pointed out the fact that sedimentation and subsidence 
were going on together, and, therefore, that the upper surface was 
probably never convex at all, but nearly or quite horizontal all the 
time. Subsidence under such conditions might produce horizontal 
tension -or stretching of the lower strata, but could not produce the 
crushing and plication of the upper. 

To Whitney's idea that plication was the result of the subsidence of 
a mountain axis he likewise took exception, and contended that chains 
and ranges were, beyond question, produced by horizontal thrust, 
crushing together the whole rock mass and swelling it up vertically, 
this thrust being the necessary result of secular contraction of the inte- 
rior of the earth. In other words, "mountain chains are formed by 
the mashing together and upswelling of sea bottoms where immense 
thicknesses of sediments have accumulated, and as the greatest accu- 
mulations usually take place off the shores of continents mountains are 
usually formed b} r the uppressing of marginal sea bottoms." The sub- 
marine ridges and hollows shown by the soundings of the Coast Survey 
to exist along the course of the Gulf stream, extending from the point 
of Florida to the coast of New England, he felt might be true subma- 
rine mountain ranges now in course of formation by the processes 
already described. 

Referring to the subject of metamorphism of rocks, as shown in 
mountain chains, he argued as follows: Supposing sediments accumu- 
lating along the shores of a continent. The first effect is lithitication, 
and, therefore, increasing density, causing contraction and subsidence 
pari passu with the deposit. Next, if the sedimentation continue, 
aqueo-igneous softening or even melting would follow, not only of the 
lower portions of the sediments themselves, but of the underlying strata 



560 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

upon which they were deposited. Finally, this softening would be 
sufficient to cause a yielding to horizontal pressure along the line, and 
a consequent upswelling of the line into a chain. Even the granitic 
axes of mountain ranges might, he thought, in most cases be but the 
lowermost, and, therefore, most highly metamorphosed portions of the 
squeezed mass, exposed by erosion. 

He agreed with Richthofen and Whitney that the great masses of 
lava, often constituting the chief bulk of mountain chains, had not 
come from craters but from fissure eruptions, and that volcanoes are 
themselves only secondary phenomena, produced by the access of 
meteoric water to the still hot interior portions. He did not, how- 
ever, agree with them in assuming that this iluidal mass was a part of 
a universally incandescent liquid interior, but rather a submountain 
reservoir locally formed. He felt that this theory, while not dependent 
upon, was powerfully supported by, the views of Ro.se, Bischoff, and 
others as to the metamorphic origin of granite and other igneous 
rocks, a view which regarded the surface materials as having passed 
by perpetual cycles through all the stages of rocks and soils — igneous 
rocks disintegrated to soils carried away and deposited as sediments; 
consolidated into stratified rocks; metamorphosed into gneiss, granite, 
or even lavas; to be again, after eruption, reconverted into soils, and 
recommence the same eternal round. 

In furtherance of these same views, Le Conte in 1876 gave, in the 
American Journal of Science, the results of observations made in the 
Coast Range Mountains of California along the line of the Central 
Pacific Railroad. He found the largely unaltered rocks here thrown 
into a series of anticlines and synclines with angles of dip varying 
from 65° to 70°. From this he estimated that the original matter as 
deposited on a sea bottom must, in the building of the range, have 
been crushed from a breadth or width of 15 to 18 miles into 6 
miles, with a corresponding upswelling of the whole mass. In 1878 
Le Conte had another paper in the same journal' on the same sub- 
ject, in which he argued that mountain ranges are always formed by 
horizontal pressure, and that this pressure on a large scale could be 
produced only by the interior contraction of the earth. To overcome 
the objections raised by some to this theory to the effect that interior 
contraction could not concentrate its manifest results along certain 
lines without such a slipping- and shearing as is impossible in a solid 
earth, he conceived the presence of a solid nucleus and a solid crust 
separated by a zone of fused or semifused matter. To an objection 
that contraction based upon shrinkage alone was inadequate to pro- 
duce the evident results, he argued that there might be other causes, 
such as loss of water in form of vapor by volcanic action, and still 
others concerning which as yet nothing was known. His theory of 
origin, as he here summed it up, consisted of three stages: (1) A stage

of preparation by sedimentation; (2; a stage of yielding by horizontal 
pressure; and (3) a stage of erosion or mountain decay. 

Le Conte was born in Liberty County, Georgia, February 26, 1823, 
and grew to manhood under influences of ease and enjoyment such as 
have fallen to the lot of few American geologists. Educated as a 

physician, he early gave up practice and in 1850 re- 
sketch of Le Conte. moved to Cambridge, in Massachusetts, to become a 

student of Agassiz. In less than two years he, how- 
ever, returned to Georgia, where he became professor of natural 
science at Oglethorpe University. His stay here was brief. In 
December, 1852, he became attached to the University of Georgia, at 
Athens, and, in 1856, professor of chemistry and geology in South 
Carolina College, at Columbia. Here he remained, enduring the vicis- 
situdes of the civil war, but abandoned his beloved South in L869 (at 
a period when men of his t} r pe were most needed) to become professor 
of geology, zoology, and botany in the Uni- 
versity of California, at Berkeley. Here 
he remained until his death, in 1902. 

In 1866 E. W. Hilgard, at the suggestion 
of Professor Henry, of the Smithsonian 
Institution, visited the salt deposits of Petite 

Islands and published the 

Hilgard's Work at , . r . 

Petite Anse, results or his observations 

Louisiana, 1872. • i o ■ i • r^ 

in the Smithsonian Contri- 
butions to Knowledge in 1872, under the 
title On the Geology of Lower Louisiana 
and the Salt Deposits of Petite Anse. 

As was to be expected, Hilgard differed 
completely with Thomassy, whose work has 
been noted, and who, it will be remembered, 
regarded the island as of volcanic origin. On the contrary, the island, 
and others of the group, were regarded as Cretaceous outliers, with 
mappings of drift and other alluvial matter, the salt beds themselves 
being of Cretaceous. age. 

Both Hilgard and Thomassy believed the sand and shingle detritus 
covering a large portion of the States bordering on the lower Missis- 
sippi was due to a great flood, which might have resulted from the rapid 
melting of the northern glaciers. Referring to the belief expressed 
by some of the western geologists to the effect that the main body of 
the drift was due to floating icebergs on an inland sea, Hilgard con- 
ceived its northern limits to have been fixed by the ice barriers. 
Toward the east, southeast, and southwest it would be defined by the 
Allegheny, Cumberland, and Ozark ranges, the main outlet lying, 
doubtless, in the axis of the Mississippi Valley, the gap between the

562 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Ozark and Cumberland highlands not having been eroded to its present 
level. 

A sudden break in the lower portion of the barriers would, he 
argued, produce the phenomena as now observed, namely, the action 
of- violent currents plowing up and redepositing the material of the 
more ancient formations, carrying down in the main channel rocks 
of high northern derivation, restratifying and otherwise modifying 
toward the end a good portion of the iceberg drift and, as the current 
diminished, covering over the coarse material with the Orange sand. 

In 1873 W. C. Kerr, State geologist of North Carolina, published 

in the Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society a brief but 

suggestive paper on the possible influence of the earth's rotation on 

the deflection of rivers. He called attention to a fact 

Effects of Earth's so obvious as to have been evident to the common

people oi that State, that in both the Carolinas the 
eastward flowing rivers always presented high banks and bluffs on the 
south side and low plains and swamps on the north; also to the fact, 
owing to these topographical conditions, that the large towns and main 
roads were always on the south side also. 

In seeking for a cause for this Kerr rejected the slow subsidence 
theory of Tuomey, and suggested that it was due rather to the rotation 
of the earth, coacting with the force of the river currents, and called 
in to sustain his opinions the law of motions as developed by Prof. 
W. Ferrel: 

In whatever direction a body moves on the surface of the earth there is a force 
arising from the earth's rotation which deflects it to the right in the northern, but 
to the left in the southern hemisphere. 

Whether or not the application of this principle was original with 
Kerr, it is of course impossible to say. This, however, seems to have 
been its first application in America, though von Baer had suggested 
as early as I860 like results in the case of north and south flowing 
rivers, as the Irtisch and the Volga of Kussia. 

Kerr's final report on the geology of North Carolina, although pre- 
sented in 1870, was not printed until 1875, owing to the parsimonious 
action of the State legislature, the public printer being allowed finally 
to set it up only under condition that the work be 
caroifna.Tsjo 1 ° rth done in intervals of other work on the laws, docu- 
ments, supreme, court reports, etc. 

The report was accompanied by a colored geological map and three 
colored sections. The classification of the rocks adopted was as shown 
on next page.

This report gave a very fair summary of the knowledge of the 
geology of North Carolina up to date. The thin gravels overlying 
the eroded surfaces of the Eocene, Miocene, and Cretaceous in the 
eastern part of the State were regarded as of glacial origin, the under- 
lying rock being planed down by the currents and drifting ice which 
brought the bowlders from the Archean hills of Chatham. This idea 
is not, however, general^ accepted, North Carolina being now uni- 
versally recognized as far south of the glacial limit. 

The gold-bearing gravels were looked upon as beds of till which had 
crept down the declivities of the hills and mountains, as glaciers 
descend Alpine valleys by successive freezing and thawing of the 
whole w T ater-saturated mass, both gravitation and the expansion of 
freezing contributing to the downward movement. This is evidently 
the same idea as that later advanced by I. C. Russell in his description 
of the debris streams of Alaska. 

Appendices attached contained a list and descriptions of the new 
genera and species of fossil shells, by T. A. Conrad, and the minerals 
of the State, by F. A. Genth. A chapter on corundum and its asso- 
ciated rocks, by C. D. Smith, is mainly of interest from the fact that 
Smith regarded the chrysolitic rocks as of igneous origin, a conclusion 
which for sometime was disputed, but to which later workers have 
returned. 

Kerr was of Scotch-Irish descent, though born in North Carolina. 
His parents dying while he was quite young, he was adopted by a 
Rev. Dr. Caruthers, a Presbyterian minister, under whose instruction 
he was fitted for the State University at Chapel Hill, where he gradu- 
ated in 1850 with highest honors. After graduation he taught school 
for a while at Williamstown in his native State, until elected to a pro- 



564

fessorship in Marshall University, Texas. This position he resigned 
in 1852 to accept an appointment as computer in the 
sketch of Kerr. Nautical Almanac Office, then located at Cambridge, 
Massachusetts. While here he entered the Lawrence 
Scientific School and studied under Agassiz, Gray, and the. chemist 
Horsford. 

In 1857 he accepted a professorship at Davidson College in North 
Carolina, where he remained until 1865, though his active work ceased 
in 1862, owing to a falling off in income and students, incident to the 
civil war. From the latter part of 1862 to early in 1864 he was chemist 
and superintendent of the Mecklenburg Salt Works, near Charleston, 
South Carolina, but after the destruction of the works, returned to 
North Carolina, where he became nominally State geologist in 1864, 

though active work, owing to the confusion 
and disorganization of war, did not begin 
until 1866. 

It is safe to say that few men ever entered 
upon the work of a geological survey under 
more unfavorable auspices. He himself 
had had no extended experience, nor was 
he a trained specialist. Little money was 
available, the industries of the State para- 
lyzed, and her social conditions disorgan- 
ized, if not demoralized. The State had 
never a more genuine and sagaciously pub- 
lic-spirited citizen than he, but the times 
were evil, and for several years Professor 
Kerr shared the fate of all public officials 
who were endeavoring to adjust, to reconcile, and to go forward. His 
motives were misrepresented, his character assailed, his abilities ques- 
tioned, his work maligned. Yet in the face of all this, without good 
maps and with few roads, a great work was accomplished. 

During one of the first years of the survey he traveled, mainly on 
horseback, 1,700 miles over mountainous country, with and without 
roads, and during the season of 1866 and 1867 not less than 4,000 
miles. Work thus performed was from necessity largely in the nature 
of reconnaissance. The subjects of drainage and topography received 
a large share of attention, and. indeed a large part of his work was 
along physiographic lines, though by no means limited thereto. Agri- 
cultural and mineral resources were investigated and, so far as pos- 
sible with the limited means at his command, advertised. His papers 
which attracted the most widespread attention were doubtless those 
relating to the action of frost on superficial materials and the unequal 
erosion of the banks of a stream, due to the earth's rotation.

Kerr was a man of slight physique, and for the last ten or fifteen 
3 T ears of his life suffered from catarrh of the digestive organs. The 
funds available were too small to enable him to employ permanent 
assistants, either in the field or as clerk or amanuensis. Under these 
circumstances the amount of work accomplished was certainly 
remarkable. 

He was an exceedingly liberal man — a man of generous temper and of large views. 
He was deeply religious and always prominent, although in an unobtrusive 
way, in matters pertaining to the church. As a Christian gentleman, those who 
have known him best have admired him most. His heart was warm and generous, 
his mind clear, active, and progressive, his conscience keen and indexible. He was 
honest in every sense of the word. There was nothing of policy in his thought 
or action; on the contrary, he was frank and outspoken, at times even to a fault. 
(Holmes.) 

In 1873 the legislature of Alabama passed an act reviving the sur- 
vey, which had been discontinued after the death of Professor Tuomey, 
in 1857, and named Prof. Eugene A. Smith, 
of the University of Alabama, State geol- 
ogist. This office Professor 
l^ba m S a W i°8 r 7 k 3 in Smith has continued to hold 
down to the present time. 
Up to and including 1880 he had made five 
reports. These were given up mainly to a 
discussion of the geographic distribution of 
the various formations comprised within the 
State limits, with extensive notes regarding 
the economic possibilities of coal, iron, and 
other minerals of less importance. 

In his report for 1875-76 he treated of 
the geology of Jones Valley and the Coosa 
Valley region and announced the practical 

identity of the formations there found with those described by Pro- 
fessor Safford in Tennessee, recognizing the Ocoee, Chilhowee, Knox 
sandstone, shale and dolomite, and Lower and Upper Carboniferous. 
In those of 1877, 1878, and 1879 special reference was made to the 
Warrior coal fields and their probable value. Several colored county 
maps were given, but no geological map of the entire State. 

in the spring of 1873 there was organized a second geological survey 

of Kentucky, with N. S. Shaler, then professor of paleontology at 

Harvard, chief geologist and director, and A. R. Crandall, P. N. 

Moore, C. J. Norwood, and J. R. Proctor, assistants.

tion of Professor Shaler, the surve} T coming finally to a close in 1891.

REPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



Up to 1880 live reports of progress were issued, dealing mainly with 
economic problems. 

The plateau country drained by the Colorado River offers facilities 

for the study of geological problems such as are, perhaps, equaled 

nowhere else in the world. This is especially true with reference to 

problems relating to stratigraphic succession, of uplift

of the Grand Canyon, with a minimum amount of contortion of the beds, and 

1869=1874. „ . _. , 

of erosion. Ihe plateau nature of the country was 
recognized by Newberry while with the Ives expedition in 1860, and 
by Blake in connection with the Pacific Railroad surveys in 1850. It 
remained, however, for Powell, Gilbert, and Dutton to first bring out 
the salient features of the geology of the region and to work out the 
problems in a way that, to quote the words of Emmons", has formed 
the starting point of modern physical geography. 

In the summer of 1869, J. W. Powell, a retired officer of the Federal 

Army, made a boat trip clown the Colorado, 
starting from Green River City on the Union 
Pacific Railroad May 24, and emerging from 
the mouth of the Black Canyon, nearly 900 
miles below, on August 30 following — a 
journey that, to quote Emmons again, '•'is 
unequaled in the annals of geographical 
exploration for the courage and daring dis- 
played in its execution." 

In his reports on these explorations, b 
which were made and published under direc- 
tion of the Smithsonian Institution, Powell 
called attention to the fact that the canyons 
are gorges of corrosion and due to the action 
of the river upon the rocks, which were 
undergoing a gradual elevation. As he expressed it, the river pre- 
served its level, but the mountains were lifted up; as the saw revolves 
on a fixed pivot while the log through which it cuts is moved along. 
The river was the saw which cut the mountain in two. This is essen- 
tial^ the idea advanced by Ha} T den in 1872 in his report on the geology 
of Montana. 

In this report Powell first made use of the expressions of antecedent 
and consequent valleys, meaning in the first instance that the drainage 
was established prior or antecedent to the corrugation of the beds by 
faulting and folding; and in the second case, that the valleys have 
directions which are dependent upon the corrugations. Valleys which 
were formed by streams, the present courses of which were deter-

mined by conditions not found in the rocks through which the chan- 
nels are now carved, but which were in existence when the district 
hist appeared above sea level, he called supt rim/posed valleys. 

In this same report, too, Powell made use for the first time of the 
term hose level of erosion, which he defined as — 

an imaginary surface inclining slightly in all its parts toward the end of the prin- 
cipal stream draining the area through which the level is supposed to extend, or 
having the inclination of its parts varied in direction as determined by tiibutary 
streams. 

He pointed out, further, that the region of the Grand Canyon was 
a.ter all a region of lesser rather than greater erosion; that had the 
country been favored with a rainfall equal to that of the Appalachian 
country, the entire area might have been reduced to a base level which 
would be the level of the sea, though the evidence of such erosion 
might be almost wholly obliterated. 

J. P. Lesley, writing in 1874 on the iron ores of Spruce Creek, 
Warriors Mark Run, and Half Moon River, in Huntingdon and Cen- 
ter counties, Pennsylvania, took the ground that they were residual 
deposits from the decomposition of ferriferous Lower

more than 16,000 feet of Upper Silurian. Devonian, 
and Carboniferous rocks, and had been subsequently exposed through 
decomposition and erosion. 

At the end of the coal era the Middle States rose from the waves. * * The 

edges of the Bellefonte fault stood as a mountain range as high as the Alps, and the 
backs of some of the great anliclinals of Pennsylvania must have'formed plateaus 
then as high as Tibet and Bootan arc now. 

Erosion commenced and has continued through the Permian, Jurassic, Cretaceous, 
and Tertiary ages to the present day, and still goes on. The high plateau was 
gradually worn down to the present surface. Mountains once 30,000 or 40,000 feet 
high are now but 2,000 or 3,000 above sea level. 

Such extreme views as to the possible height of mountain ranges 
are equaled among modern geologists only by those of Clarence King 
(p. 612). 

In 1874 N. H. Winchell accompanied, as geologist, the party headed 
by Capt. W. Ludlow to the Black Hills of Dakota. His report, appear- 
ing in 1875, occupied pages 21 to 66 of the quarto volume issued. 
and was accompanied by a geological map. Winchell 
u^e n Bi h a e ckHins, r ^874. recognized the occurrence of Cretaceous, Jurassic, 
Triassic, Carboniferous, and Silurian (Potsdam) rocks, 
overlying schists and slates, into and through which granite had been 
intruded. He agreed in the main with Hayden's observations, as 
given in his Second Annual Report (1868), though he failed to find 
evidence of the unbroken conformability of the fossiliferous forma- 
tions. On the contrary, he mentioned the Red Beds as lying uncon- 
formably on the Carboniferous limestone.

.The presence of numerous bands of prospectors on the Indian res-

that a proper basis might be secured for future nego- 
tiations with the Indians. The locality being then comprised in the 
Sioux Indian reservation, immediate direction of affairs was put in 
the hands of the Indian Bureau. Under this authorization W. P. 
Jenny was appointed to undertake the work, with Henry Newton as 
assistant. The party entered the region on the 3d of June, some 400 
strong, a large military guard being esteemed necessary on account 
of the manifest discontent of the Indians, and returned to Fort Laramie 
on October 14, after an absence of four months and twenty da} 7 s. A 
preliminary report on the mineral resources of the Hills, accompanied 
by a map by V. T. McGilly cuddy, the topographer, was submitted by 
Mr. Jenny and published in the report of the Commissioner of Indian 
Affairs for 1875. The complete report on the mineral resources, cli- 
mate, etc., with a preliminary map, was published in the form of an 
octavo pamphlet of 71 pages in 1876, and the final Report on the Geol- 
ogy and Resources of the Black Hills of Dakota, in form of a quarto 
volume of 566 pages, with large folio atlas, in 1880. This included, 
also, the previous reports on the mineral resources, noted above. Un- 
fortunately. Doctor Newton, to whom was left the general geology of 
the region, died before his report was fully prepared for the press, the 
work being ably edited by G. K. Gilbert, and the volume issued as 
one of the monographs of the Powell surve} r . 

The Black Hills region, it will be remembered, had already been 
touched upon and fragmentary surveys made by numerous parties, 
including Dr. John Evans in 1819 and 1853, Thaddeus Culbertson in 
1850, Meek and Hayden in 1853, and Hayden, with the military expe- 
ditions of Harvey and Warren in 1855 and 1857, and with Captain 
Raynolds in 1859. Hayden again visited the region under the auspices 
of the Philadelphia Academy in 1866, and N. H. Winchell with Custer's 
expedition in 1876, as just noted. Under all these conditions it is dif- 
ficult to estimate the value of the work of Newton, Much that he 
stated in his report had already been made known by the authorities 
mentioned above. On the other hand, much that he might have had 
in mind to say has never appeared, owing to his untimely death. 

The summary of Black Hills history, as given, shows an older 
Archean consisting of shales and sandstones over which, after an inter- 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1870-1879. 569 

val of erosion and metamorphism, a newer Archean, consisting mainly 
of sandstones, was deposited, accompanied by abundant intrusions of 
granitic rock. Then followed the period in which these rocks were 
raised to a nearly vertical position, metamorphosed, and deeply eroded, 
after which the various Potsdam, Carboniferous, Red Bed, Jura, and 
I Jretaceous deposits were conformably laid down. Then followed the 
uplift and subsequently the unconformable depositions of the White 
River Tertiaries upon their flanks. The date of the uplift is therefore 
set as the interval of time between the Cretaceous formation and the 
beginning of the Miocene Tertiary. (See under Hayden, p. 591.) 

Newton showed that the drainage from the Black Hills was conse- 
quent — that is, it conformed to the dip of the strata. This he con- 
ceived to be caused by the streams having acquired their direction dur- 
ing the uplift of the hills, or while they were being laid bare by the 
drainage of a lake. In either case the drainage is consequent upon the 
uplift. With the rivers — the BeJle Fourche and the South Fork of 
the Cheyenne — the case is different, however. These cut across the

uplifted strata in a way to show that the drainage is superimposed. If 
they existed prior to the deposition of the Tertiary sediments they 
were completely blotted out. 

J. H. Caswell described the various metamorphic and eruptive rocks 
collected by the survey, his paper forming the second on the subject 
of micropetrography to appear from the Government press, Zirkel's 
fortieth parallel report (1870) being the first. The report was accom- 
panied by two plates with eight colored figures illustrating micro- 
structure and composition, and is of particular interest as giving the 
first authoritative account of the occurrence of the rock phonolite in 
the United States. Caswell, although one of the first in a new and 
fascinating field, seems to have rested on his laurels, content with the 
one effort, his name in geologic literature appearing here for the first 
and only time. 

W. P. Jenny, to whom fell the economic work, reported gold occur- 
ring (1) in veins of quartz traversing Archean schists and slates; (2) 
in slate mineralized by waters depositing silica and iron pyrites; (3) in

the conglomerate forming the lower layer of the Potsdam sandstone 
and derived from the Archean rocks; (4) in trachyte and porphyry 
intruded at the time of the elevation of the hills; (5) "in deposits in 
the slates and sedimentary rocks produced by the intrusion of the tra- 
chyte and porphyry," and (6) '"in placer gravels resulting from the 
decomposition and erosion of the above formations in Tertiary times." 
The quartz veins he did not regard as "true fissure veins, 1 ' but, as 
they occurred filling fissures between the lamellae of the schists formed 
in the process of the folding, were referred to as " interlaminated 
fissures." 

The fossils collected by this expedition were worked up by Whit- 
field while at Albany in 1876. 

Under act approved March 18, 1873, a geological survey of Wiscon- 
sin was authorized, and I. A. Lapham appointed State geologist by the 

then acting governor, C. C. Washburn. 
Owing to an apparent oversight on the part 
of Governor Washburn, 
wTsco™ S in S "873 y ° f Professor Lapham's name 
was, however, not sent to 
the senate for approval, and an opportunity 
thereby offered for Governor Washburn's 
successor, W. R. Taylor, to supersede him 
by Dr. O. W. Wight. So far as shown by 
public records, the transaction was purely 
political and not at all creditable to Gov- 
ernor Taylor. 

Lapham therefore served but two years, 
during this time rendering two reports. 
These were not published independently, 
but subsequently formed the first 65 pages of the second volume of the 
reports of State geologist, T. C. Chamberlin. He was assisted by R. D. 
Irving, T. C. Chamberlin, and Moses Strong. The two reports 
referred to were naturally of a preliminary nature, designed to form 
the basis for future work. Lapham, perhaps even more than others of 
his time, was an all-round naturalist — a type not possible in this day 
and generation. Beginning life as a stonecutter and afterwards a civil 
engineer, he yet found time to study and observe in nearly all branches 
of the sciences, and this, too, with remarkable accuracy. His first 
paper of a geological nature is said to have been prepared when he 
was but sixteen } 7 ears of age, and was published in the American 
Journal of Science for 1828. This gave an account of the geology 
in the vicinity of the Louisville and Shipping-port Canal, and was illus- 
trated by a map and geological sections of a nature very creditable 
to a j^outh of his years. 

His bibliography includes upward of fifty titles, embracing, besides 
geology, articles on climatology, archaeology, botany, and cartogra-

phy. He is represented as a modest, patient, and industrious man, 
living- more for the service of others than for his own aggrandizement. 
He died of heart trouble while alone on a lake near Oconomowoc, 
Wisconsin. 

Lapham was succeeded, as above noted, by O. W. Wight, who served 
but one year (1875). His one report of progress was not published at 
the time, but was likewise included by Chamberlin in the second vol- 
ume of the final reports, bearing date of 1877. It contained matter of 
little other than historical interest. 

In February, 1876, Prof. T. C. Chamberlin was placed in charge of 
the State survey. The organization continued in existence until 1879, 
the final reports appearing in the form of four royal octavo volumes, 
dated, respectively, Vol. I, 1883; Vol. II, 1877; Vol. 
of h ^sc e oS S i U 87 V 6 ey HI, 1880, and Vol. IV, 1882. comprising altogether 
3,035 pages. 
The principal assistants on the survey 
were R. D. Irving, F. H. King, Moses 
Strong, E. T. Sweet, J. D. Whitney, and 
L. C. Wooster. R. P. Whitfield served as 
paleontologist. Aside from acting as di- 
rector of the survey, Chamberlin himself 
took charge of the geology of eastern 
Wisconsin, of which he described in con- 
siderable detail the hydrology, the soils. 
and the glacial drift. The so-called Kettle 
Range he believed to be in part moraines, 
and the kettle holes to be due mainly to the 
melting of masses of ice buried in the grav- 
els. He discussed the economical value of 
the clays and shell marls of the region, and 

for the first time in America demonstrated the usefulness of the 
microscope in examinations of detrital rocks. In this connection he 
noted that a microscopic examination of the sand grains of the Pots- 
dam sandstone was entirety fatal to the view still occasionally advanced 
to the effect that such were produced by crystallization from solution. 
He, in his turn, however, failed to recognize the possibility of the 
crystalline form of some of the granules being due to secondary 
enlargement (see pp. 469 and 553). 

The oolitic iron ore lying between the Cincinnati shales and the 
Niagara limestone was thought to be undoubtedly a marine deposit laid 
down in detached basins. It was shown, further, that the three well- 
marked classes of limestone occurring in the southeastern counties of 
Wisconsin graded into each other and were doubtless formed contem- 
poraneousl} T , the residual mounds or ridges being ancient coral reefs, 
while the o-ranular sand rock was formed from calcareous sands

derived b}^ wave action from the reef, the compact strata being deeper 
quiet- water deposits of the same material. 

Chamberlin also investigated the ore deposits of the southeastern 
part of the State, and discussed thoroughly the problems involved in 
the origin of the ores, disagreeing in many minor points with both 
Doctors Owen and Whitney. The crevices in which the ores occur he 
believed to have originated primarily in the folding of the rocks by 
lateral pressure. He pointed out that the ore beds occur mainly in 
basin-like depressions and argued that the ore material, originally in 
solution in sea water, was deposited contemporaneously with the lime- 
stone through the action of sulphureted vapors given off by the 
decomposition of organic matter, and that, after the elevation of the 
beds above sea level, percolating meteoric waters oxidized and dis- 
solved the ore once more and carried it into the fissures above noted, 
where it was the second time precipitated as sulphides. Fourteen- 
huudredths of 1 per cent of ore material disseminated throughout 
LOO feet in depth of the ore-bearing limestone would, he pointed out, 
be sufficient to have formed all the deposits as they now exist. He 
did not agree with Whitney in assuming that the oceanic waters of 
early geologic periods were richer in metallic salts than those of Jater 
data, instancing in support of his argument the fact that the ore-bearing 
beds were in many cases really poorer in organic matter than those 
which were nonmetalliferous and more ancient. This criticism did not, 
however, affect the general principle as laid down by Whitney. With 
his predecessors he doubted the probability of the existence of work- 
able deposits of ore in the Lower Magnesian limestone. 

Volume I of the reports of this survey was designed as a general 
treatise on the geology of the State, suited to the wants of explorers, 
miners, landowners, and manufacturers. In this Chamberlin stated 
his belief that the original source of the Keweenawan copper ore was 
the igneous rocks, from whence it has been concentrated through the 
agency of permeating atmospheric waters. To quote his own words, 
he believed — 

First, that the metals, copper and silver, were primitively constituents of the rocks 
that were melted to produce the lavas which formed the trappean sheets of the 
formation; second, that they were brought up and spread out, commingled with 
the molten rock material; third, that they were chemically extracted thence by per- 
colating waters and concentrated in the porous belts or fissures of the formation, 
giving rise to the exceptionally rich deposits for which the formation is famous; and 
fourth, that the surface disintegration of portions exposed in the latter part of the 
period yielded metallic ingredients to the adjacent sea, frem whence they were 
extracted by organic agencies, giving rise to impregnated sediments, which, in turn, 
through subsequent concentrations, gave rise to other copper and silver deposits, 
among which are to be reckoned the later metallic horizons of the Lake Superior 
region and possibly elsewhere. 

Naturally, the subject of the drift was treated in considerable detail! 
The Glacial period was divided into the Terrace or Fluviatile epoch,

Champlain or Lacustrine epoch, the Second Glacial epoch, inter- 
Glacial epoch, and first Glacial epoch. This formal announcement of 
the fact that there had been two distinct periods of glaciation was 
here made for the first time, although as noted on page 463, Prof. Edward 
Hitchcock had suggested its possibility as early as 1856. The law of 
iiowage Chamberlin regarded as essentially similar to that of viscous 
fluids, in accordance with the observations of Agassiz, Forbes, Tyn- 
dall, and others. A later study of Greenland glaciers has caused him 
to change his views on this point. 

Irving, as one of Chamberlin's assistants, dwelt with great detail on 
the lithological character of the rocks in the regions surveyed by 
him, and his reports are notable for the beauty of the colored plates 
of thin sections, which were by far the best that had 
been prepared and published by an American up to 
that date. He was assisted in this part of the work 
by C. R. Van Hise. He also described in some detail the glacial drift, 
and was the first to announce that the Kettle 
Range of central Wisconsin was a continu- 
ous terminal moraine. 

In the third edition of his work on Acadian 
Geology, which appeared in 1878, Dawson 
returned once more to a vigorous discussion 
of the problems of the ice age, and to 
register again his opposition to the views 
arenerallv held by American

arguments used closely re- 
sembled those of his former papers and may 
be reviewed here for the last time. He re- 
garded the phenomena of the bowlder clay 
and drift in eastern America as due to the 
action of local glaciers, drift ice, and the agency of cold northern 
currents. Against the theory of an universal glacier he again argued 
on the ground that such suppositions were not warranted by the facts. 
"The temperate regions of North America could not be covered with 
a permanent mantle of ice under existing conditions of solar radiation; 
for, even if the whole were elevated into a table-land, its breadth 
would secure a sufficient summer heat to melt away the ice except 
from high mountain peaks." For the supposition that such immense 
mountain chains existed and have disappeared, he found no warrant 
in geology, and for such an "unexampled astronomical cause of refrig- 
eration" as the earth's passing into a colder portion of space, he found 
no evidence in astronomy. Against Frankland's idea that glaciation 
was brought about through a higher temperature of the sea along 
with a lower temperature of the land, he instanced the actual colder

condition of the sea, as shown by the fossils of that period. He agreed 
with Lyell in regarding the theory of the varying eccentricity of the 
earth as expounded by Croll as insufficient; moreover, it seemed to him 
physically impossible that a sheet of ice such as that supposed could 
move over an uneven surface, striating it in directions uniform over 
vast areas and often different from the present inclination of the 
surface. 

He was further influenced in his opinion by the work of Hopkins, 
who showed, apparently, that only the sliding motion of glaciers 
could polish or erode rock surfaces, and the internal changes in their 
mass — the result of weight — could have little or no effect. Glaciers, 
moreover, he argued could not have transported the bowlders great 
distances and lodged them upon the hilltops, and the universal glacier 
would, moreover, have no gathering ground for its materials. The 
huge feldspar bowlders from the Laurentide Hills, stranded at Mon- 
treal Mountain at a height of 600 feet above the sea and from 50 to GO 
miles farther southwest, and which must have come from little, if 
any, greater elevation and from a direction nearly at right angles to 
that of the glacial striae, were against the ice-sheet theory, as were 
also the large bowlders scattered through the marine .stratified clays 
and sands, and the occurrence of marine fossils in the lower part of 
the drift, in the true till near Portland and Cape Elizabeth, Maine, and 
at various points on the St. Lawrence in Canada. In the Post- 
Pliocene deposits of Canada he found evidence of a gradual elevation 
from a state of depression which may have amounted to more than 
500 feet, while only the bowlder clay represents the previous subdi- 
vision, and only striations on the rocks indicate an ice-clad condition 
of the land. Both plant and animal life indicated to him that the con- 
ditions of temperature of the sea were not greatly different from those 
of to-day. 

Referring to the direction of the stria?, he found evidence such as 
led him to declare without hesitation that their direction is ''from the 
ocean toward the interior against the slope of the St. Lawrence Val- 
ley. " This, he felt, at once disposed of the glacial theory for the 
prevailing set of striae, since he could not suppose a glacier to move 
from the Atlantic up into the interior. On the other hand, he 
regarded it as eminently favorable to the idea of ocean drift. A 
subsidence sufficient to convert the Canadian plains, New York, and 
New England into a sea would, he thought, cause the Arctic current 
to pour over the Laurentide rocks on the north side of Lake Superior 
and Lake Huron, cutting out the softer strata to form their beds, and 
drifting their materials to the southwest. The lower strata of the 
current would be diverted through the strait between the Adirondacks 
and Laurentide Hills, and, flowing over the ridge of hard rocks which 
connects them at the Thousand Islands, would cut out the lony - basins 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1870-1879. 575 

of Lake Ontario, heaping- up at the same time in the lea of the Lau- 
rentian ridge the great mass of bowlder clay which intervenes between 
Lake Ontario and Georgian Bay. Lake Erie and Lake Michigan 
were, he argued, cut out by similar currents. At times of obstruction 
of currents which produced the southwest striations, while the val- 
leys of the Ottawa, Mohawk, Lake Champlain, and the Connecticut 
were arms of the sea, the currents would set along these arms, pro- 
ducing the northwest and southeast striations. 

Local glaciation might prevail in high peaks, but the so-called 
moraines were to his mind shingle beaches and bars and old coast lines 
loaded with bowlders and ozars. The tiords on the coast, like the 
deep lateral valleys of mountains, were evidences of the action of 
waves and currents rather than those of ice. 

The subsidence noted above, which would result in converting the 
plains of Canada, New York, and New England into seas and cause 
the Arctic current to flow over the submerged area from northeast to 
southwest, would produce a current which would move up a slope, 
and the ice which it bore would, therefore, tend to ground and grind 
the bottom as it passed into shallow water." 

In the first edition (1855) of Acadian Geology the occurrence of the 
albertite deposits in the Lower Carboniferous rocks of New Brunswick 
received considerable attention. In the discussions there given relat- 
ing to their origin, he concludes that the material belongs to the purest 
variety of bituminous coal, related to the pitch coals or jets. He 
admitted, however, that it had some claim to be considered a distinct 
mineral species intermediate between the coals and asphalts. At that 
time he regarded the deposit as having originated through the deposi- 
tion of organic matter in fresh water, the deposit having since been 
very singularly distorted by mechanical pressure. 

In the second edition of the work (1868) he, however, modified his 
expressed opinion, accepting the views of more recent explorers like 
Hitchcock, Bailey, and Hind, who had described the deposit as a vein 

"To substantially these views Dawson held to the very last. In his Ice Age in 
Canada (1893) he is found still combating vigorously the idea that all northern 
Europe and America were covered by a mer de glace moving to the southward and 
outward to the sea, and which moved not only stones and clay to immense distances, 
but glaciated and striated the whole surface. The glacial theory of Agassiz and 
others he described as having grown until, like the imaginary glaciers themselves, it 
overspread the whole earth. He adopted rather what he called the moderate viev, 
of Sir Roderick Murchison and Sir Charles Lyell, to the effect that Pleistocene subsi- 
dence and refrigeration produced a state of our continents in which the lower levels, 
and at certain periods even the tops of the higher hills, were submerged under water 
tilled every season with heavy Held ice formed on the surface of the sea, as at present 
in Smiths Sound, and also with abundant icebergs derived from glaciers descending 
from unsubmerged mountain districts. The later Pliocene, so far as Canada was con- 
cerned, he considered to be a period of continental elevation and probably ot tem- 
perate climate. 



576 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

filled with bituminous matter. The source of the bituminous matter 
he supposed to be the Lower Carboniferous shales. In his own words: 

The deposit of the Albert mine would thus be a vein or fissure constituting an 
ancient reservoir of petroleum which, by the loss of its more volatile parts and partial 
oxidation, has been hardened into a coaly substance. 

He regarded the Nova Scotia gypsum beds as due to the alteration of 
beds of limestone by free sulphuric acid poured into the sea by springs 
or .streams issuing from the volcanic rocks. In this connection he 
gave a highly interesting verbal picture of the condition of affairs, as 
he imagined them to exist, at what is now the Southern Hants and 
Colchester at the time when the marine limestones and gypsums were 
produced. 

At this period, then, all the space between the Cobequids and the Rawdon Hills 
was an open arm of the sea, communicating with the ocean both on the east and 
west. Along the margin of this sea there were in some places stony beaches, in 
others low alluvial flats covered with the vegetation characteristic of the Carboniferous 
period. In other places there were creeks and lagoons swarming with fish. In the 
bottom, at a moderate distance from the shore, began wide banks of shells and corals, 
and in the central or deeper parts of the area there were beds of calcareous mud with 
comparatively few of these living creatures. In the hills around, volcanoes of far 
greater antiquity than those whose products we considered in a former chapter, were 
altering and calcining the slaty and quartzose rocks; and from their sides every land- 
flood poured down streams of red sand and mud, while in many places rills and 
springs, strongly impregnated with sulphuric acid, were ii< >wing or rising, and entering 
the sea, decomposed vast quantities of the carbonate of lime accumulated by shells 
and corals and converted it into snowy gypsum. 

The fauna of the seas of the Lower Carboniferous coal formations 
and Permian periods, both in Europe and America, presented so great 
similarities that, in a broad view, he felt they were identical. The 
changes and the subdivisions of this fauna were related not merely to 
lapse of time but to vicissitudes of physical conditions. It followed 
that, according to his reasoning, if the peculiar Permian conditions 
indicated by the rocks came earlier in Nova Scotia than in Europe the 
character of the fauna might also be changed earlier. In other words, 
"We have both rocks and shells with Permian aspect in the earlier 
Carboniferous period." The fact that the marine fauna of the Lower 
Carboniferous of Nova Scotia more nearly resembled that of Europe 
than the western States he regarded as indicating that the Atlantic was 
at that time probably an unobstructed sea basin as now, while the Appa- 
lachians already, in part, separated the deep-sea fauna of the Carbon- 
iferous seas east and west of them. 

Concerning the origin of coal he wrote: "Mineral charcoal results 
from subaerial decay; the compact coal, from subaqueous putrefaction 
more or less modified by heat and exposure to air. " Further, he regarded 
mineral charcoal as the wood}^ debris of trees, while the compact coal 
was produced from the bark of these same trees along with such woody

and herbaceous matter as might be embedded or submerged before 
decay had time to take place. 

He referred again to the observations and conclusions made by him 
in connection with his Joggins work several years previous, to the 
effect that the layers of clear, shining coal (pitch or cherry coal) are 
composed of flattened trunks of trees, and that of these usuall} T the 
bark alone remains, the lamination of the coal being due to the super- 
position of la} T ers of such flattened trunks alternating with the accu- 
mulations of vegetable matter of successive years, and occasionally 
with tine vegetable muck or mud spread over the surface by rains or 
by inundations. 

The stigmaria found in the clay underlying nearly every bed of coal 
he felt proved beyond question the accumulation of the coal-forming 
materials through growth in situ, following in this respect the teach- 
ing of Logan. The under or tire clay was thus looked upon as a fossil 
soil robbed of its alkali and lime through growths of terrestrial 
vegetation. 

The rocks of the Arisaig series, which in 1855 he regarded as Silu- 
rian (Devonian ?), in the edition of 1868 he says "must be regarded as 
representing the middle and upper parts of the Upper Silurian, a 
position somewhat lower than that assigned to it in the first edition." 

The provincial predictions of Dawson in this work are somewhat 
amusing. Thus, on page 4: 

Further, since by those unchanging laws of geological structure and geographical 
position which the Creator himself has established, this region must always, notwith- 
standing any artificial arrangements that man may make, remain distinct from Can- 
ada mi the one hand and New England on the other, the name Acadia must live; 
and I venture to predict that it will yet figure honorably in the history of this west- 
ern world. The resources of the Acadian provinces must necessarily render them 
more wealthy and populous than any area of the same extent on the Atlantic coast 
from the Bay of Fundy to the Gulf of Mexico, or in the St. Lawrence Valley from 
the sea to the head of the Great Lakes. Their maritime and mineral resources con- 
stitute them the (Jreat Britain of eastern America, and though merely agricultural 
capabilities may give some inland and more southern regions a temporary advantage, 
Acadia will in the end assert its natural preeminence. 

Dawson was a Nova Scotian by birth, having first seen the light of 
day at Pictou in 1820. He was educated at Pictou Academy and sub- 
sequently at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, where he came 

under the influence of Jamieson, Forbes, Balfour, and 
sketch of Dawson. Alexander Rose. In 1817 he returned to Nova Scotia, 

and in 1855 assumed the principalship and chair of 
natural history in McGill University, Montreal, at the head of which 
institution he remained until 1893, when he was forced by ill health to 
resign. His first original paper, as has been noted, was on a species of 
field mouse found in Nova Scotia, and was read before the Wernerian 
Society of Edinburgh. From so insignificant a beginning he developed

578 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

into one of the most prolific and voluminous writers. The Geological 
History of Plants, The Air Breathers of the Coal Period, The Cana- 
dian Ice Age, The Dawn of Life, Story of the Earth and Man, Fossil 
Men and their Modern Representatives, The Meeting Place of Geology 
and History, and Modern Science in Bible Lands are among the best 
known of his writings, in addition to the work above reviewed. In 
educational matters he was always prominent, and the present stand- 
ing of McGill University is largely due to his industry and ability as 
an administrator. He is represented by his biographer as a man of 
quiet geniality, gentle and courtly in manner, but, as may be readily 
surmised from his record in the Eozoon controversy, decided in opin- 
ion and firm in action. Like Alexander Winchell he took a prominent 
part in overcoming the popular prejudice concerning the supposed 
antagonism between religion and the sciences, particularly geology. 
An advanced and liberal thinker, he was, nevertheless, not an evolu- 
tionist in the ordinary acceptance of the term. He believed that the 
introduction of new species of animals and plants had been a continu- 
ous process, not necessarily in the sense of deviation of one species 
from another, but in the higher sense of the continued operation of 
the cause or causes which introduced life at first. The history of a 
life, he argued, presents a progress from the lower to the higher, from 
the simpler to the more complex, and from the more generalized to 
the more specialized. In this progress new types are introduced and 
take the place of the older ones, which sink to a relatively subordinate 
place and become thus degraded. To him paleontology furnished no 
direct evidence as to the actual transformation of one species into 
another or as to the actual circumstances of creation of a species; but 
the drift of its testimony to him showed that species come in per saltum 
rather than by any slow and gradual process. 

In 1879 there was published, as already noted (p. 515), part one of 
Whitney's Auriferous Gravels of the Sierra Nevada of California, 
and in 1880 part two of the same work, the combined papers comprising 
a volume of 569 pages, in which the distribution, 
a^av"is y i879 8o erous origin, and characteristics of the auriferous gravels 
of the Sierras are fully discussed and much infor- 
mation given regarding their method of mining and economic value. 

Discussing the origin of the conglomerates and the prevailing 
theories regarding their marine origin, he wrote: 

Again, these detrital deposits are not distributed over the flanks of the Sierra in 
any such way as they would have been if they were the result of the action of the 
sea. On the contrary, there is every reason to believe that they consist of materials 
which have been brought down from the mountain heights above and deposited in 
preexisting valleys; sometimes very narrow accumulations, simply beds of ancient 
rivers, and at other times in wide lakedike expanses of former water courses. 

Subsequent work has apparently fully confirmed Whitney's view, 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1870-1879. 579 

The time of deposition was put down by him as during the latei 
Pliocene epoch, and not as late as the drift of the Diluvial period. 

Many pages were devoted to the vertebrate fossils found in the 
auriferous gravels, and particularly to the evidences of man, and the 
Calaveras skull. The question of the contemporaneous deposition 
of this skull with the gravels has been too frequently discussed by 
ethnologists to need more than a brief mention here. Suffice for the 
present to state that Whitney himself seems to have been fully con- 
vinced of the genuineness of the find, and regarded it as establishing 
beyond doubt the existence of Tertiary man in California. 

In discussing the source of the gold and its distribution in the gravel 
Whitney took occasion to express the opinion that, as a whole, the 
occurrence of metalliferous ores is rather a surface phenomenon than 
a deep-seated one, and that this is due to the favorable conditions for 
fissure formation and deposition from solution controlled by tempera- 
ture and pressure. 

The source of the gold he thought to be undoubtedly the quartz 
veins which traverse the Jurassic slates, a fact to his mind refuting 
Murchison's theory of the occurrence of gold exclusively in Paleozoic 
rocks. He found no evidence to support the opinion that the large 
size of the nuggets in the gravel was due to a gradual growth through 
chemical precipitation." He regarded such as more or less dentritic 
and branching masses which have been liberated from the gangue and 
reduced to pebble form by the pounding they received in the moving 
gravels. 

Whitney's work on the auriferous gravels was followed in 1880 and 
1882 by an equally comprehensive work on climatic changes of later 
geological times, the discussion being based largely on observations 
made during the work of the California survey. 
changed 88oTf882 Whitney was struck by the appearance of recent desic- 
cation in the West, as illustrated by the lake regions 
of the Great Basin, and from a study of the phenomena here met with 
as compared with those in other regions he was led to conclusions 
radically at variance with those commonly accepted by his co-workers. 
It will be remembered that in the work on the auriferous gravels he 
took the ground that there had been no appreciable change in eleva- 
tion of the Sierras since the close of Cretaceous times, and he argued 
that the Tertiary auriferous gravels were laid down by the rivers of 
that period which flowed through broad channels, the present deep-cut 
V-shaped channels being due to the smaller volume of water which 
was the result of a decrease in annual precipitation. 

Concerning such, he wrote: 

It is, as a general rule, safe to assume that where U-shaped valleys exist the per- 
pendicular walls have an orographic origin and that those of V form have had that 

« Recent work of A. Liversidge, the Australian mineralogist, confirms this view. 



580 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

shape given to them by the debris piles which have accumulated against their 
sides. The farther we descend the mountain slope the less the grade and conse- 
quently the less the carrying power of the stream. Hence the valley which is 
U-shaped in the upper part of its course acquires more and more of a V form as it 
approaches the plain at the base of the range from which it heads. 

Whitney thought to be able to trace, not to go too much into detail, 
a period of warmth and heavy precipitation followed by one of desic- 
cation, but anticipated by one of cold and glaciation, the glaciers, how- 
ever, being limited to the most elevated ranges of the Cordilleras. At 
the outset he announced himself as opposed to the "wild and absurd 11 
ideas that had prevailed regarding glaciation in the Sierras, and stated 
it as his belief that here at least ice had played but an extremely sub- 
ordinate part as a geological agent, though "there is no doubt that 
the great California range was once covered with grand glaciers, but 
little if at all inferior to those which now lend such a charm to the 
Swiss Alps. 1 ' 

In the discussion of the question he called attention to the fact that 
the Great Lakes of North America and most of those of other coun- 
tries as well are included in areas underlain by Paleozoic rocks or 
those partly Paleozoic and partly Archean, and are due not to glacial 
erosion, but to orographic movements — Lake Superior, for instance, 
occupying a s}mclinal depression in Paleozoic rocks just along the edge 
of the Azoic series. 

The Lake region of the Great Basin while likewise orographic in 
origin has become desiccated through climatic changes, he finding no 
evidence that there has been any essential alteration in the configura- 
tion or topography of the western side of the continent since the 
Glacial epoch — that is, since the time when the crests of the highest 
ranges were to some extent covered with snow and ice. Therefore, 
no part of the desiccation which appears to have taken place since that 
time can be due to orographic changes; the phenomenon must have 
been a climatological one. 

The phenomenon of fiords he considered as due to aqueous erosion 
along mountainous coasts which have since become depressed. 

It was Whitney's opinion, further, that the geological importance 
of the ice sheet had been greatly exaggerated. It seemed to him 
be}'ond question that the icebergs had played an important part in car- 
rying and distributing the large angular bowlders which in man} 7 places 
rest upon the surface in such a manner as to show that they could not 
have been placed in their present position by running water or by a 
general ice sheet. 

He regarded it as evident enough that the climate of northeastern 
America during the Glacial epoch was a period of greater precipita- 
tion than is now taking place, but that it was a period of intense cold 
he would not admit. Glaciation or a Glacial period was due merely to 
increased precipitation. In order that such precipitation should take 



AMEKICAN GEOLOGY — DECADE OF 1870-1879. 581 

place an increased evaporation from the land and water was necessary. 
This could be brought about only byageneral increase of temperature, 
the amount of precipitation being the same; whether it would or not 
give rise to glaciers would depend upon temperature, which itself 
would be dependent upon local conditions which might or might not be 
due to elevation of land surfaces. His idea, in brief, was that while 
during the Glacial epoch over the entire globe there might be a period 
of sufficient warmth to produce the desired evaporation, the precipita- 
tion would fall as rain or snow, according to the local uplift or depres- 
sion. That the glaciers are now retreating in nearty every instance 
he regarded as due not so much to a change in climate — at least, not 
to a gradual increase of temperature — but rather to a gradual decrease 
in the amount of annual precipitation. He felt that "The weight of 
the highest authorities is decidely against the theories of both Adhe- 
mar and Croll, from the standpoint of astronomical science; w r hile it 
is believed that these theories are equally at variance with the conclu- 
sions of the most eminent climatologists of the present day. At all 
events, the evidence in favor of a cyclical recurrence of cold, or 
Glacial periods, sinks into insignificance when compared with that indi- 
cating a progressive diminution of temperature on the earth's surface 
during the geological ages, and from the very earliest time when land 
began to exist from the conditions of which light on this subject could 
be procured. 

In this connection it may be mentioned that Whitney considered the 
movement of glacial ice due to water: 

Glacier ice is not simply ice, but a mixture of ice and water, and it is to the pres- 
ence of the latter that the whole mass owes its flexibility. The larger the amount of 
water, other things being equal, the more easily the glacial mass moves. When the 
water increases so as to get the upper hand, the ice gives way with a rush and 
becomes an avalanche. * * * The extreme variation of the rate of motion of 
different glaciers coming down from the inland ice of Greenland is due to the differ- 
ent amounts of water which they have imbibed. 

The rapid development of the economic resources of Pennsylvania,

between the publication of Rogers's final report (1858) and 1874,

Penntyivania, ec ^ e °f geological facts. An appeal was, therefore, 

1874-1887. made to the State legislature in 1873 for the establish- 

ment of a second geological survey. This culminated in 1874 in an 
enactment providing for the appointment of ten commissioners, hav- 
ing authority to appoint a State geologist "of ability and experience" 
who should, with ten competent assistants, make such investigations as 
might be required to elucidate the geology of the State and put the

results of this and previous work, of either individuals or surveys, 
into a convenient form for reference. 

Acting under this authority the commissioners in 1874 appointed as 
State geologist J. P. Lesley, a topographer of the first survey under 
Rogers, and subsequently connected, in the capacity of topographer 
and geologist, with various private surveys — a one-time clergyman, and 
then professor of geology in the University of Pennsylvania. Annual 
appropriations were made, amounting during the thirteen years in 
which the survey existed to $545,000. Under these seemingly favor- 
able auspices the second survey was inaugurated. With Lesley was 
associated from time to time, in one capacity or another, a consider- 
able number of individuals, among whom mention may be made of 
C. A. Ashburner, C. E. Beecher, J. C. Branner, J. F. Carll, H. M. 
Chance, E. W. Claypole, E. V. dTnvilliers, L. G. Eakins, Persifor 
Frazer, F. A. (Tenth, C. E. Hall, T. S. Hunt, A. E. Lehman, Leo 
Lesquereux, A. S. McCreath, F. Prime, jr., J. J. Stevenson, I. C. 
White, Arthur Winslow, and G. F. Wright, 

From the work of this organization has sprung the most remarkable 
series of reports ever issued by any surve3 T . Up to and including 1887, 
when held work was practically discontinued, there had appeared some 
77 octavo volumes of text, with 35 atlases, and a "Grand Atlas." 
These were followed in 1892 and 1895 by the three octavo volumes 
constituting the final report. 

A very large portion of the work of this survey fell beyond the 
time limits mentally set for the present history. It may, however, be 
stated that the main energies of the organization were directed toward 
the solving of economic problems," and, as was the case with the 
Rogers survey which preceded it, more attention was devoted to 
chemical and physical than to paleontological questions. Lesquereux, 
who had been responsible for what paleobotanical work was done 
under Rogers, was commissioned to extend his investigations, and in 
1880 and 1884 issued three reports of text and one atlas on the Coal 
Flora. The strictly paleontological work done from 1875 to 1880 was 
that of J. J. Stevenson and I. C. White, along the West Virginia, 
Ohio, and New York borders. 

« 1 have been obliged for the last fourteen years to direct the State survey almost 
exclusively in an economic direction, so as to make the whole of every appropriation 
bring as much fruit to the business, community as possible, neglecting, in what 
systematic geologists may possibly or probably consider a shameful manner, strictly 
scientific researches. Even when I have ordered long and extensive scientific 
researches (as in the case of the analyses of the Lower Silurian limestone series oppo- 
site Harrisburg) it has been, not in the spirit of transcendental science, but with the 
express intention to use the results directly as applied science to the economical 
demands of the State. It can hardly be understood by outsiders how completely a 
State bureau is shut up to this necessity. 

Yours, respectfully, J. P. Lesley. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1870-1879. 583 

Iii L881 and 1883 Professor White studied the fossils of the middle 
belt of counties on the Delaware, Susquehanna, and the upper Juniata 
rivers. Professor Stevenson did the same for the Maryland border, 
while E. W. Claypole was commissioned to prepare a special report 
on all forms discoverable in the district of the lower Juniata. 

The main energies of the survey were, as above noted, devoted to 
economic problems, with particular reference to the extent both geo- 
graphic and geologic of the coal and petroleum formations. A great 
amount of good was undoubtedly accomplished, perhaps as much as 
one has a right to expect. Work in later years has, however, showed 
that the fundamental defect of the survey was lack of accurate topo- 
graphical maps. This seems the more remarkable in view of the fact 
that the same defect became obvious during the progress of the Rogers 
survey, and further, in that Lesley was, himself, a topographer. 

To quote Lesley's own words (manuscript), the facts of dominant 
importance which became impressed upon the Pennsylvania survey 
were as follows: 

(1) The Paleozoic formations reach their maximum thickness in this State; and 
consequently admit of a greater differentiation than elsewhere into special groups of 
beds. 

(2) The middle region of the State is magnificently plicated and eroded, exposing 
innumerable outcrops, connected in zigzags, and of immense length. 

(3) No unconformable later deposits cover and conceal these outcrops, so that there 
is an unexampled opportunity for the study of variable thickness and changes of 
type. 

(4) The topographical features are so dependent upon the lithologv and structure 
that any geological survey of the region must be virtually a topographical survey. 

(5) The geological areas are of great size and so clearly defined, and so distinct in 
character, that they naturally claimed and received each one a survey of its own. 
These areas are: 1, The Bituminous Coal field of the west and north; 2, the Anthra- 
cite Coal fields in the east; 3, the middle belt of Devonian and Silurian formations; 
4, the Mesozoic belt of the south and east; 5, the South Mountain Azoic; 6, the 
Philadelphia belt of Azoic rock; and 7, the region of Glacial Drift. 

(6) The natural section of the Bituminous Coal Measures, down the Monongahela 
and up the Allegheny rivers, relieved the study of that part of the Paleozoic system 
of all ambiguity. 

(7) The great amount of mining done in the anthracite fields made that part of 
the survey peculiarly exact and correct. 

(8) The great size and number of the brown hematite mines furnished unusual 
opportunities for the study of that kind of mineral. 

(9) The great size and number of limestone quarries, exploited for the manufacture 
of iron and for fertilizing farms, opened to view every part of the great Siluro- 
Cambrian formation, the whole of the Lower Helderberg, all the Devonian, and most 
of the Carboniferous limestone beds. 

(10) On the other hand, Pennsylvania is singularly destitute of workable veins of 
the precious metals. Its poverty in gold, silver, copper, and lead is extreme. It has 
but one important zinc deposit; and but one nickel mine." In fact its Azoic regions 
as a whole are barren country, containing but a few small magnetic iron ore beds, in

strong contrast to the adjoining Azoic region of northern New Jersey. What little 
white marble it possesses makes a narrow outcrop for a few miles along a single line. 
Some serpentine rock, a little chrome iron, one large soapstone quarry, and some 
kaolin deposits conclude the list of its Azoic minerals. 

Practically viewed, the geology of Pennsylvania is wholly Paleozoic, on the most 
magnificent scale, with an unexampled wealth of anthracite and bituminous coal, 
brown hematite iron ore, limestone, rock oil, and rock gas; and to the study and 
description of these its geological survey has from first to last been devoted. 

Little attention has been paid to the lithological study of the building stones of the 
State, or to their economic description. The entire State is a rock quarry. Every 
known building stone from the granites, gneisses, quartzites, and traps, to hearth- 
stones, flagstones, brownstone, and limestone can be got with ease and with infinite 
abundance on lines of transportation. All the principal outcrops Of these building 
stone formations have been located and their places in the Paleozoic series defined 
in the reports, with sufficiently precise descriptions of their qualities and uses; but 
beyond this the survey could not go. 

Lesley was born in Philadelphia in 1819, and graduated at the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania in 1838, becoming- almost immediately con- 
nected with the State geological survey 
under Rogers, in the capacity of topog- 
rapher. In 1841. during 
sketch of Lesley. the temporary suspension 
of this work, he entered 
upon the study of theology at Princeton, 
and was licensed to preach in 1844. He 
then went to Europe, where he studied in 
the University of Halle during the winter 
of 1844-45. 

Returning to America, he assumed the 
pastorate of a Congregational church in 
Milford, Massachusetts, but resigned in 
1851 and owing, it is stated, to a change- 
in his religious views, gave up the ministry 
altogether. Returning to Philadelphia, he soon became secretary of 
the Iron and Steel Association and of the American Philosophical 
Society, and prominent in geological matters, particularly those relat- 
ing to iron and coal. Had he so chosen, he could undoubtedly have 
acquired a fortune, but, preferring science for science' sake, he put 
aside all offers of private gain and remained poor, often desperately 
so, to the end of his da}^s. 

He was a man of tall, lank, but commanding figure, and, according 
to his biographer, of impressionable and emotional nature, an enthusi- 
ast and optimist, but often lamentably melancholy, undemonstrative, 
and even cynical. A man of tremendous nervous energy, aggressive 
and outspoken, his writings are full of expressions which, for terse- 
ness and unpolished emphasis, are unequaled. Thus, in a letter to 
Powell relative to the coloring of maps and the names of the various 
formations, he wrote:

The fact is these English names are good for nothing in America and ought to 
be ignored. If I were an expert in profanity, I should say damn the text-books, 
Dana's, Le Conte's, and all of them. They are mere museums of embarrassments, 
so far as classification is in question. * * * Fortunately Pennsylvania is a very 
small corner of the United States, and I suppose it matters very little whether its 
structure appears on your map or not. But in heaven's name (I mean the heaven 
of geology), what do you gain by distinguishing a miserable subfonnation like the 
Permian (one or two patches) and not distinguishing an enormous subfonnation 
5,000 feet thick like the Subcarboniferous? « 

THE WORK OF F. V. HAYDEN AND F. B. MEEK. 

The reports of D. D. Owen and Dr. John Evans on the collections 

made b} T the latter in the mauvaises terres of the White River in 1849, 

as published in 1852, had attracted a great deal of attention, and in 

the spring of 1853 Dr. F. V. Hayden and F. B. Meek 

Havden and Meek 

in the Bad Lands, were employed by Prof, flames Hall to visit the Bad 

1853=1866. 5 i n • ,. ,. -i 

Lands to make collections oi fossils. 

The party met at St. Louis on Saturday. May 14, 1853, where they 
found Dr. John Evans bent upon a similar errand under the direction 
of Dr. B. F. Shumard. Leaving St. Louis, the party proceeded by 
boat up the Missouri, reaching Fort Pierre— what is now the town of 
Pierre, in South Dakota — Juno 21, whence they proceeded by wagon 
into the Bad Lands proper. Here, in spite of the difficulty of holding 
the party together through fear of hostile Indians, the}' remained for 
a period of several weeks, returning to Fort Pierre on July 18. The} x 
brought with them a large and valuable collection, including mam- 
malian remains which were investigated by Dr. Joseph Leid}^. 

The Cretaceous invertebrate fossils were studied by Professors Hall 
and Meek and described by them in a memoir published by the Amer- 
ican Society of Arts and Sciences of Boston in 1854. This paper was 
accompanied by a brief vertical section by Meek, showing the order of 
superposition of the Cretaceous beds. As this is believed to be the 
first section of the region, it is here reproduced in full:

«Someof Lesley's "digs" at his fellow-workers are masterpieces of their kind. 
Thus in Volume I of his final report, where attempting to describe the chaotic condi- 
tions existing on the earth during the earliest Archean times, and the intense chem- 
ical activity incidental to the deluges of "sour rain" falling upon the hot surface, he 
says (p. 53): "All this had taken place before the first age of which we have any 
geological monuments and is only known to God and Dr. Sterry Hunt, who has 
described it magnificently in his Chemical Researches."

In the following- spring - (1851) Doctor Hayden again ascended the 

Missouri River, this time parti} 7 under the auspices of the American 

Fur Company. He spent two years on this expedition, during which 

time he visited the various portions of the Upper 

Hayden 's Work on . , . . 

the Upper Missouri, Missouri, being without any other means than what he 
earned or secured in various ways as he went along, 
and dependent even for subsistence entirely on such friends as he met 
in the country, among whom were Col. A. J.«Vaughan, the Indian 
agent, and Mr. Alexander Culbertson, of the American Fur Company. 

He traversed the Missouri River to Fort Benton and the Yellow- 
stone to the mouth of the Big Horn, and also considerable portions of 
other districts not immediately bordering on the Missouri. As the 
boats of the fur company had to be towed in ascending the river, the 
progress was necessarily slow. The time thus occupied by the boats 
was utilized by Hayden on the shores, and as a result he traversed a 
considerable portion of the journey on foot. 

The vertebrate remains collected on this trip were, as in a previous 
case, described by Doctor Leidy, mainly in papers read before the 
Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, while the invertebrates 
were described by Doctor Hayden himself in connection with Professor 
Meek. The collections, which were deposited partly with the Academy 
of Science of St. Louis and partly with the Academy of Natural 
Sciences of Philadelphia, contained a larger number of species than all 
those previously known from that country, many of them being new 
and of a remarkable character. 

Early in 1856 Hayden returned to St. Louis, and on February 15 

of that year received from Lieut. G. K. Warren, of the U. S. Corps 

of Topographical Engineers, an offer to report upon the Sioux country. 

This report was made, and in May of the same year

in f J une and proceeded up the .Loup i'ork or the 
Platte, returning to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, early in the following 
December. 

Hayden noted the occurrence of — 

1. Metamorphic Azoic rocks, including granite. 

2. Lower Silurian (Potsdam). 

3. Devonian (?). 

4. Carboniferous. 

5. Permian. 

6. Jurassic. 

7. Cretaceous. 

8. Tertiary. 

9. Post-Tertiary and Quaternary. 

In a preliminary report given by Warren in the American Journal 
of Science for Ma} T , 1859, attention was called to the important physi- 
ographic fact that the Niobrara River seemed kt to run along a swell or 
ridge on the surface and to be practically without tributaries." 

This would seem to be a recognition of the fact, though not the prin- 
ciple, that streams flowing from a mountainous country and laden with 
silt may, in their lower levels where the current is less rapid and the 
carrying power less, so deposit their load as to build up both the bot- 
tom and banks, and this until the stream actually occupies the crest of 
a ridge. The Platte River is, however, a better illustration of this 
than is the Niobrara. That portion of the channel running between 
steep bluffs he thought ''must have originated in a fissure in the rocks 
which the water basins enlarged and made more uniform in size." 
This failure at this late day to realize that a stream may carve out its 
own channel can be excused only on the ground that Warren was not 
a geologist. 

During the summer of 1858 Messrs. Hayden and Meek explored a 

portion of what was then called the Territory of Kansas. The route 

followed, as given by Hayden in his report published in the Proceedings 

of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 

Ka e nsa a s n ,8 H 5 a 8 3 : denin ™S as follows:' 

From Leavenworth City on the Missouri, across the 
country to Indian ola near the mouth of Soldier -Creek and the Kan- 
sas River; thence up the north side of Kansas and Smoky Hill rivers 
to the mouth of Solomons Fork. Here they crossed the Smoky 
Hill, following it up on the south side to a point near the ninety- 
eighth degree of west longitude, from which point they struck across 
the country in a southwest direction to the Santa Fe road, which 
was followed northeastward to the head of Cottonwood Creek. 



588 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



Leaving the road here, they went down the Cottonwood Valley some 30 
miles, when they turned due east to Council Grove, from which place 




the Santa Fe road was followed southwest for about 24 miles to a 
watering place known as Lost Springs. Here they struck across the 
country in a northwest direction to Smoky Hill River again at a point

nearly opposite the mouth of Solomons Fork. Thence the route \ay 
down the south side of Smoky Hill and Kansas rivers to Lawrence, 
and thence across the Kansas in a northeastward direction to Leaven- 
worth city. The explorations were very successful, and the results 
embodied in numerous papers in the Proceedings of the Academy of 
Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and elsewhere. 

In April, 1859, Capt. W. F. Raynolds was instructed to organize an 

expedition for the exploration of the country from which flow the 

upper tributaries of .the Yellowstone River and of the mountains in 

which these tributaries and the Gallatin and Madison

Doctor Hayden was appointed surgeon and naturalist 
of this expedition. The party left St. Louis May 28, 1859, going - up 
the Missouri to Fort Pierre, which point was reached about the middle 
of June. From here the route was westward and northwestward to 
the Yellowstone River by way of the Cheyenne, the Belle Fourche, 
and Powder rivers. The Yellowstone was reached near the mouth of 
the Big Horn about the middle of August. From the Yellowstone 
the expedition turned southward early in September and followed 
up the Big Horn, skirting the eastern edge of the Big Horn Moun- 
tains, finally going into winter quarters on Deep Creek, near the North 
Platte River, about the middle of October. 

The following May (1860) explorations were resumed, the expedi- 
tion going to Fort Benton, on the Missouri, by way of the North 
Platte. Wind, Snake, and Madison rivers. Fort Benton was reached 
July 11. On the 23d of July the return trip to Omaha was begun, 
the party proceeding by boat down the Missouri River to Fort Union, 
and from the latter point by land. Omaha was reached October 1, 
where the party disbanded. 

The report of this last expedition, published early in 1869, com- 
prised some 171 octavo pages, including 30 pages of paleontological 
notes by J. S. Newberry. It was accompanied by a colored geological 
map of the region north of the forty-second parallel and lying between 
the ninety-eighth and one hundred and fourteenth meridians (tig. 97). 

Some of the more important conclusions arrived at by Hayden as a 
result of observations on these expeditions are as follows: He announced 
in 1857 the discovery of Potsdam sandstone in the country about the 
headwaters of the Yellowstone, and in a preliminary 
laHy n wTk Hayden ' s publication in the American Journal of Science for 
L861 described it as more or less changed by heat from 
beneath. The other formations noted were Carboniferous (including 
Permian?), red arenaceous deposits overlaying -the Carboniferous, but of 
uncertain age; Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary deposits. During 
the long interval that elapsed between the deposition of the earliest 
part of the Silurian and the commencement of the Carboniferous, 



590 EEPOET OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

he believed dry land to have prevailed over a large portion of the 
West, and he found no evidence of deep-water deposits until far up 
into the Cretaceous. Near the close of this epoch the waters of the 
great Cretaceous seas receded toward the present position of the 
Atlantic on the one side and the Pacific on the other, leaving large 
areas in the central West dry land with but a slight elevation above 
the sea level. He showed that the White River Tertiary deposits 
were younger than the Lignite, and that the older members of the 
western Tertiary were clearly separable into four divisions exclusive 
of the Pliocene of the Niobrara. He believed that the estuarian depos- 
its ushered in the dawn of the Tertiary epoch and that they belonged 
to the Eocene period. The evidence of the fossils was regarded as 
indicating that a much milder climate prevailed throughout the West 
during the greater part of the Tertiary than at present — a climate 
somewhat similar to that of the Gulf States at the present day. 

In an article on the Primordial sandstone of the Rocky Mountains, 
published in the American Journal of Science for 1862, he announced 
the finding of undoubted evidence of the existence of the equivalent 
of the Potsdam sandstone of the New York series in two important 
outliers of the Rocky Mountain chain. He pointed out the singular 
uniformity in the nature of the sediments and general lithological 
resemblance to the eastern type, but did not regard this as due to the 
currents bringing the material from the East. He thought, rather, 
that the uniformity was due to a similar uniformity on the part of the 
underlying rocks from which sediments were derived — that is, he 
believed that the source of all the sediments composing the Primor- 
dial rocks in the West could be traced to underlying rocks in the 
immediate vicinity. He noted the gradual thinning out of this Pri- 
mordial sandstone toward the West, and quoted the observations of 
D. D. Owen in Minnesota. Whitney in Iowa, Satford in Tennessee, 
and Shumard in Texas as confirmatory. The lower secondary forma- 
tions, on the other hand, as he pointed out, gradually increased in 
thickness. 

He noted no unconformability in any of the fossiliferous sedimen- 
tary rock.s of the Northwest from the Potsdam sandstone to the sum- 
mits of the true Lignite Tertiary, but found proof of two great periods 
of disturbance, the one prior to the deposition of Potsdam sandstone, 
when the Azoic or granitic rocks were elevated to a more or less 
inclined position, and the other, much the more important, at the 
close of the Lignite Tertiary, when the "massive nuclei of the ranges 
were raised above the surrounding country." 

In the American Journal of Science for 1862 Hayden had an impor- 
tant paper in regard to the period of elevation of the ranges of the 
Rocky Mountains near the sources of the Missouri River and its tribu- 
taries. He regarded the evidence as clear that the great subterranean 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY DECADE OF 1870-1879. 591 

forces which elevated the western portion of the continent were called 
into operation toward the close of the Cretaceous epoch, and that the 
gradual rising- continued without a general bursting of the earth's 
surface until the accumulation of the Tertiary lignite deposits, or at 
least the greater part of them. Also, that after the fracture of the 
surface ccramenced and the great crustal movements began to display 
themselves, the whole country continued rising, though perhaps with 
intervening periods of subsidence, up to and even including the present 
period. 

During the years of the civil war western exploration of all kinds 
was interrupted, Hayden served in the Federal army as a surgeon 
from 1862 until 1865, resigning to accept the position of professor of 
mineralogy and geology in the University of Pennsylvania, a position 
which he retained until ls~2. 

In the summer of 1866 he undertook a second expedition to the Bad 
Lands, this time under the auspices of the Academy of Natural Sci- 
ences of Philadelphia. In company with James Stevenson he left Fort 
Randall, South Dakota, August 3. The trip was made

ing which a circuit of six hundred and fifty miles was 
accomplished. The large and valuable collection of mammalian fossils 
was described b}' Leidy in his great work of upward of 450 large 
octavo pages and 30 plates, published under the auspices of the Academy 
of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. The work began with an intro- 
duction of 12 pages on the geology of the Tertiary formations of Dakota 
and Nebraska, accompanied by a map. In this work Hayden pointed 
out the possibility of bridging over the chasm heretofore existing 
between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods by means of transition 
beds belonging to the lignite series. He reiterated some of the state- 
ments made in previous writings, to the effect that, at the close of the 
Cretaceous period, the Rocky Mountain area was occupied by the Avaters 
of an ocean with perhaps a few peaks projecting. Near the close of 
the period the surface had reached an elevation so great as to form 
long lines of separation between the waters of the Atlantic on the 
East and those of the Pacific on the West, and then this great water- 
shed began to rise above the surrounding country and the period of 
great fresh-water lakes was inaugurated. The elevation during the 
Cretaceous period he regarded as slow and gradual, but at about the close 
of the period or in the early part of tlie Tertiary the limit of tension 
in the crust was readied and long lines of fracture commenced which 
form the nucleus of the present mountain ranges, including the lofty 
continuous ranges with a granitoid nucleus along the eastern portion 
of the Rocky Mountains, as the Wind River, Big Horn, Laramie, or 
Black Hills. He showed that the Tertiary beds were in part deposited 
before the upheaval, as indicated by the inclination of the lignite beds. 



592 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

The lower Tertiary fossils included brackish-water forms, and he 
thought to trace the "history of the growth of the continent step by 
step from the purely marine waters of the Cretaceous ocean to the 
period when the mountain ranges were elevated,' 1 the ocean waters 
excluded and inclosed lakes formed, at first salt, but gradually fresh- 
ened by influx from fresh-water streams. He stated further that the 
elevating forces acted throughout the Tertiary and post-Tertiary pe- 
riods, and probably continue to act down to the present time. During 
the Tertiary period there existed at least four and possibly five of these 
fresh-water lakes in the West, two of which were of great extent. The 
deposits in these lakes formed the bad lands of the Judith, the great 
Lignite basin, the Wind River basin, and the White River group. A 
portion of this last, that in the region of the White River, he regarded 
as of Miocene age. 

THE U. 8. GEOLOGICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL SURVEYS UNDER F. V. 

HAYDEN. 

In the spring of 1867 Hayden, acting under the direction of the 
General Land Office, and with an appropriation from Congress amount- 
ing to $5,000, began his work as U. S. geologist in Nebraska, and in 
so doing laid the foundation for the U. S. Geological 
N^bras°ka"l 867° in Survey as it exists to-day. Hayden was assisted dur- 
ing the first year by Dr. C. A. White and F. B. Meek. 
His first annual report comprised 61 octavo pages, and dealt largely 
with the possible occurrence of workable beds of coal within the State 
(decided in the negative); the loess, which he regarded as silt brought

and New Mexico, the survey being at the same time placed under the

In this report he confirmed the statement made by him in the 
American Journal of Science for March, 1868 — 

that all the lignite Tertiary beds of the West are but fragments of one great basin, 
interrupted here and there by the upheaval of mountain chains or concealed by the 
deposition of newer formations.

He pointed out that the main range of the Rocky Mountains "is 
really a gigantic anticlinal and all the lower ranges and ridges 
* * * only monoclinals, descending steplike to the plains on each 
side of the central axis.' 1 Also that there were two kinds of ranges 
in the Rocky Mountain system — one with a granitoid nucleus, with 
long lines of fracture, and in the aggregate possessing a specific trend; 
the other with a basaltic nucleus, composed of a series of volcanic 
cones or outbursts of igneous rocks, in many ruses forming saw-like 
ridges like those of the Sierras. 

He found no evidences of any unconformity between the Cretaceous 
and lower Tertiary beds and no such changes in the sediments as 
would account for the sudden and apparently complete destruction of 
organic life at the close of the Cretaceous period. 

He visited the Salt Lake Valle}^ and examined the terraces and old 
shore lines of Great Salt Lake, describing the beds as of post-Pliocene 
or Quaternary age and correlating them with the terraces noted by 
him above the Wasatch Canyon. He found this series of beds so 
widely extended and so largely developed in Weber and Salt Lake 
valleys that he regarded it as worthy of a distinct name, and in con- 
sequence called it the Salt Lake group. He afterwards (in 1871) 
limited the name to the older beds, which he considered as of later 
Pliocene age, recognizing the more modern character of the terraces 
in which he found a great abundance of fresh-water shells. 

The question of priority in this region having arisen between the 
King and Hayden surveys, it may be well to state that, according to 
Dr. A. C. Peale, Hayden's first work in the Salt Lake Valley was 
done in the years 1868, 1869, and 1870, and the results published in 
February, 1869, during the latter part of 1869, and the early part of 
1871. The report of the field work of 1870 in Wyoming was first 
printed in 1871, and a second edition issued in 1872. 

In 1870, with appropriations increased to $25,000, Haydeivs field of 
operations was transferred to W} T oming and portions of contiguous 
territories. Stevenson, Elliott, and Thomas were with him as before, 
while W. H. Jackson, photographer; John H. Beaman, 
Wyoming a i870. in meteorologist; A. L. Ford, mineralogist; C. P. Car- 
rington, zoologist, and Henry D. Schmidt, naturalist, 
were added to the scientific corps. 

The party outfitted at Cheyenne, in Wyoming, and proceeded north- 
ward along the eastern base of the Laramie range, exploring the Platte 
River as far as the Red Buttes, and thence passing across the divide to 
the Sweetwater; thence to the source of the Wind River Mountains, 
passing down Big and Little Sandy creeks to Green River, and explor- 
ing the northern slope of the Uinta Mountains. From Fort Bridger 
the route lay southward to Henrys Fork, which was explored down to 

NAT MUS 1904 38

its junction with Green River proper. From Green River Station the 
route followed the old stage route up Bitter Creek by way of Bridger 
Pass and the Medicine Bow Mountains, across the Laramie Plains, and 
through the Laramie Range by way of Cheyenne Pass, back to the 
point of departure. 

Studies were made also along the line of the Pacific Railroad between 
Cheyenne and the Salt Lake Valley. No topographer accompanied 
the party, and the maps used were those constructed by the engineer- 
ing department of the Army, which were, however, so inaccurate that 
to delineate the geology upon them in any but the most general way 
was practically impossible. 

During this season Ha}^den worked out the sequence of the Carbon- 
iferous and Cretaceous rocks, and made the subdivisions of the latter 
into Dakota, Fort Pierre, and Fox Hill groups, which are still recog- 
nized. He remarked that some of the fossils found in southern 
Nebraska seemed to possess Permian affinities, though as they all 
extended down into the Coal Measures they could not be considered as 
characteristic, and therefore those rocks which he had previously 
mapped and colored as Permian should be relegated to the Permo- 
Carboniferous. 

He noted the occurrence of Potsdam sandstone with Oholella mi mi 
and Lingvla at South Pass on the south side of the Sweetwater. The 
massive granites as well as the intercalated stratified gneisses extend- 
ing from South Pass City nearly to Pacific Springs were all regarded 
as of sedimentary origin. He showed that, near the close of the Cre- 
taceous period, the ocean extended all over the area west of the Mis- 
sissippi from the Arctic circle to the Isthmus of Darien. A little later 
the great watershed of the continent w T as marked out and the marine 
waters were separated into more or less shallow seas, lakes, and marshes, 
within which greAV the abundant forests that went to form the coal 
beds. 

From a study of the character of the vegetable impressions found in 
these beds, he argued that coal strata of contemporaneous origin may 
be purely marine, purely fresh water, or brackish, dependent upon 
local conditions. He pointed out that the sea had not had access to 
the Salt Lake Valley since middle Tertiary times, the sediments from 
800 to 1,200 feet in thickness, called by him the Salt Lake group, being 
regarded as of Pliocene age and contemporaneous with the Niobrara, 
Arkansas, and Santa Fe groups, and of fresh water origin. 

This report of Hayden was accompanied by special reports by Meek 
on the invertebrate paleontology, by Cope and Leidy on the vertebrate 
paleontology, by Lesquereux on paleobotany, and by Newberry on the 
ancient lakes of western North America. The volume marks the 
beginning of Cope's work with the Hayden survey, which resulted 
later in the production of the two monographs on the vertebrata of the

Cretaceous and Tertiary formations of the West, the latter, popularly 
known as wi Cope's Primer," a pudgy volume of 1,009 pages and 13-4 
full-page plates. With this year, too, began Jackson's work, which 
resulted in the production of what were at the time the finest land- 
scape photographs ever taken, and which excited the wonder and admi- 
ration of geologists the world over. 

In 1871, with an appropriation of |4l >,0I M >. held operations were t runs- 
ferred to Montana and portions of adjacent territories, including what 
is now the Yellowstone Park. To the party of the year previous was 

added A n - 

ton Schon- 

born, to- 
pographer; G. N. Allen, bot- 
anist, and Dr. A. C. Peale, 
mineralogist. The route lay 
fromOgden. Utah, along the 
shore of Salt Lake to Wil- 
lard City; thence through 
the Wasatch range to Cash 
Valley, and up the valley 
to the divide between the 
Salt Lake and Snake River 
basins. From this point they 
descended Marsh Creek to 
the Snake River basin and 
Fort Hall. Following the 
stag<> route to Virginia Junc- 
tion, they crossed Black Tail 
Deer ("reek near its source; 
thence down the Stinking 
Water to Virginia City: 
then, crossing the divide 
eastward to the Madison 
River, they descended the 
valley about 30 miles and 

crossed over the other divide to Fort Ellis, at the head of the Gallatin 
River. From Fort Ellis the}' passed again eastward over the divide 
between the Yellowstone and the Missouri to Bottler's ranch, where 
was established a permanent camp. A portion of the party then pro- 
ceeded up the Yellowstone and entered the park area, surveying the 
mammoth hot springs on Gardners River, the Grand Canyon of the 
Yellowstone, the upper and lower geyser basins, and the lake. On 
returning to Bottler's ranch in August, they passed down the Yellow- 
stone to Shields River and Fort Ellis, and thence down the Gallatin to 
Three Forks, up the Jefferson to the Beaver Head Branch and to

Horse Plain Creek, and across the main Rocky Mountain divide to the 
headwaters of Medicine Lodge Creek, into the Snake River basin, 
to Fort Hall onee more, and thence across the mountains to the head 
of Bear River and up the river to Evanston, on the Union Pacific 
Railroad, where the party disbanded. 

As in years previous, Messrs. Cope, Lesquereux, Leidy, Meek. New- 
berry, and others served as collaborators in their especial fields. The 
hot springs and geysers were described in considerable detail, and the 
fact that they were but the feeble manifestations of dying volcanic 
energy recognized. It was shown that the mountain ranges passed 
over lie along the borders of synclinal valleys, which were originally 
the basins of fresh water lakes, and that all the ranges had a general 
north and south or northwest and southeast trend, and were here and 
there connected by cross chains; that the three main branches of the 
Missouri — the Madison, Jefferson, and Gallatin— flowed through val- 
leys now extending to a width of 3 to 5 miles and now contracting to 

narrow canyons, the expansions of which 
had all been lake basins within late Tertiary 
and perhaps early quaternary times. The 
valleys were regarded as in part due to 
erosion, but for the most part as syncli- 
nal folds, the intervening mountain ridges 
being wedge-like masses of Carboniferous 
limestones. 

The work done this year by Ha} T den and 
his party resulted in the setting aside of 
the Yellowstone region as a national park. 
In 187:4, with appropriations increased to 
$75,000, Hayden divided his force into two 
parties. The first, under his immediate 
charge, consisting of Adolf Burck, chief 
topographer; Henry Gannett, astronomer; A. E. Brown, assistant 
topographer; E. R. Wakefield, meteorologist; A. C. Peale, mineralo- 
gist; W. H. Holmes, artist, and W. B. Piatt, naturalist. 
Mo man f a H f872 n '" This division left Fort Ellis, Montana, and explored 
the headwaters of the Yellowstone, Gallatin, and 
Madison rivers in much more detail than had been done during the 
previous year. 

The second or Snake River division, under the directorship of James 
Stevenson, included Frank H. Bradley, chief geologist; W. R. Taggert, 
assistant geologist; Gustavus R. Bechler, chief topographer; Adolph 
Herring and Thomas W. Jaycox, assistant topographers; William 
Nicholson, meteorologist; John M. Coulter, botanist; Dr. Josiah 
Curtis, surgeon and naturalist, and William H. Jackson, photographer. 
This division visited the Snake River or Lewis Fork of the Columbia 
in Idaho and Wyoming territories, a region up to that time little

known. The Teton Mountains — a prominent range — were ascended 
by Stevenson on this trip, this being- the first time, it was claimed, 
that the feat had been accomplished by a white man. 

Professors Leidv and Cope spent a large part of the summer in 
studying the ancient lake basins in the interior, and obtained the 
materials described in Volumes 1 and 2 of the quarto final reports. 
Lesquereux spent several months in exploring the coal beds to ascer- 
tain their geological position, and F. B. Meek and H. M. Bannister 
studied the invertebrates." 

From a preliminary study Lesquereux was inclined to call the lignite 
beds mostly Eocene. Meek regarded them as Upper Cretaceous, pass- 
ing through transition beds to the Eocene, and Cope regarded them as 
Cretaceous. Hayden in this report gives, himself, a brief review of 
the opinions held and the evidence on Avhich same is based, and con- 
cluded that the deposition of the lignite strata began during the latter 
portion of the Cretaceous period and continued on into Tertian" time 
without any marked physical break, so that 
many of the Cretaceous types, especially 
of the yertebrates. may have lingered on 
through the transition period eyen into the 
Tertiary epoch. 

In this report Hayden called attention to 
one feature in the geological structure of 
the mountains of Montana observed by the 
survey during the past season for the first 
time and not noticed in such a marked de- 
gree in any other portion of the West, and 
that is the inversion of the sedimentary 
beds, so that the oldest incline at a greater 
or less angle on those of more modern ages. 
As illustrative of this, he gave an east and 
west section across the Flathead Pass in the East Gallatin range, the 
central portion of this range being composed of Carboniferous lime- 
stone standing nearly vertically. A similar illustration of inversion 
was given by Peale in his report on the geology of Jackass Creek on 
the upper Missouri River. 

Another point to which Hayden called attention in this report was 
the fact that the streams "seem to have cut their way directly through 
the mountain ranges instead of following synclinal depressions," indi- 
cating, to his mind, that they began the process of erosion at the time 
of the commencement of the elevation of the surface. (See also Powell, 
p. 566.) The period of intense volcanic activity manifested in the 
Yellowstone region he thought to have probably commenced some- 
where during later Miocene or earl} r Pliocene epochs. 

" Bannister also reported on a geological reconnaissance along the Union Pacific 
Railroad this same year.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



With Cope, Leidy, and Marsh all in the tield of vertebrate paleon- 
tology at one time, it is not strange that a spirit of rivalry, if not of 
personal jealousy, should have arisen. This found expression in 
numerous instances which at this date are only amusing, however 
serious they may at the time have seemed to those most interested. 
Thus, Cope in 1868 deseribed and figured remains of a marine saurian 
from the Cretaceous of Kansas, to which he gave the name of Elas- 
mosaurm platyurus. Leidy, ever on the alert, made a reexamination 
of the materials, and at the meeting of the Philadelphia Academy on 
March 8, 1870, announced that the remains were, in reality, those of 
an Enaliosaurian and closely allied to Plesiosaurus, and, further, that 
Cope's error in identification lay in his having described the animal — 
the skeleton of which was without a skull and quite incomplete — in a 
reversed position from the true one." 

In 1873, with appropriations the same as 
for the previous season, the tield of opera- 
tions was transferred to Colorado, this in 
part owing to the expense of transportation, 
subsistence, and labor in regions so remote 
as those of the upper Missouri, and in part to 
the hostility of the Indians.

division was in charge of A. D. Wilson, topographer, with George M. 
Chittenden, assistant topographer, and Dr. F. M. Endlich, geologist. 
The work of this year extended as far westward in Colorado as 
Middle Park, the Elk Mountains, and the San Luis Park. It was 
during this season's work that the peculiar 
examples of subaerial erosion of Monument 
Park in Colorado were described and fig- 
ured, which have so frequently served the 
purpose of reproduction in the text-books. 
The wonderful instances of complete over- 
turning of immense groups of beds, as 
illustrated in the Elk Range, were again 

referred to, atten- 
tion being called to 
the fact that for 
several miles there 
is a double series 
from the Silurian 
up to the Creta- 
ceous, inclusive, which had been thus in- 
verted. In this report, too, were given the 
examples of inversion in the Snow Mass 
Range and the view on Roches Moutonnes 
Creek, both of which have served their pur 
pose in the text-books of Dana and Le Conte. 
The question of the age of the lignite beds 
occupied the attention of nearly all the work- 
ers in the held (see p. 647). Lesquereux, in 
his chapter on the lignite flora, argued in 
favor of the Eocene and Miocene age of the 
beds. Though not denying the presence of 
animal Cretaceous remains in the lignite 
strata, he regarded the "presence of some 
scattered fragments of Cretaceous shells as of 
little moment in comparison with the well- 
marked characters of the flora.' 1 Meek's 
invertebrate work, moreover, he regarded as 
rather in favor of the Tertiary hypothesis. To Cope's conclusions 
"that a Tertiary flora was contemporaneous with a Cretaceous fauna, 
establishing an uninterrupted succession of life across what is gene- 
rally regarded as one of the greatest breaks in geological time," he 
took exception, as it did not appear to exactly conform to facts.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



During the years 1871 to 1876 work under essentially the same con- 
ditions was continued by the Hayden survey throughout Colorado, the 
appropriations being $75,000 annually, with the exception of 1876, 
when they dropped to $65,000. The individual work of Hayden him- 
self becomes gradually less conspicuous in 
the reports issued, owing to the increased 
amount of administrative work. 

In 1874 the party under direction of 
A. K. Marvine was engaged in the southern 
portion of North Park; that under Dr. 
A. C. Peale in the region bounded on the 
north by the Eagle and Grand rivers, on 
the east by the one hundred and seventh 
meridian, on the west by the State line, and 
on the south by latitude 38° 20'. The third 
division under A. D. Wilson, with F. M. 
Endlich, geologist, was assigned to what is 
known as the San Juan district, and the 
fourth, under the immediate direction of 
H. Holmes as artist and geologist, to the 




Albert Charles Peale. 



Doctor Hayden, with- \X 
Elk Mountain region. 

In the report for 1871 Hayden devoted considerable attention to the 
stratigraphic position of the Lignite group, a discussion of which may 
be referred to later. Perhaps the most striking feature brought out 
in the work of this year was that relative to the Elk Mountains. This 
range was regarded by Hayden as a grand 
illustration of an eruptive range, "the 
immense faults, complete overturning of 
thousands of feet of strata, and the great 
number of peaks, all composed of eruptive 
rocks." indicating to him periods of violent 
and catastrophic action. The great thick- 
ness of sedimentary strata which had been 
carried to the loftiest points of the axial 
ridge in a nearly horizontal position he 
thought might be explained on the suppo- 
sition that at one -time the sedimentary mass 
rested on a floor of pasty or. semipasty 
granite, and that the forces in the interior 
were struggling to find vent and carried 
upw T ard the entire overlying mass. This description is of interest 
when taken in connection with one by Marvine the year previous as 
showing the gradual inception of the laccolithic idea afterwards 
worked out in detail by Holmes, Peale, and Gilbert, to which I will 
now refer.

In describing the Sierra La Sal south of the Gunnison in the report 
for 1875, Peale compared them in structure with the Elk Mountains — 
that is, as of eruptive origin. "By this," he wrote, "] mean that 
the sedimentary strata have been lifted up by eruptive rock which has 
broken through them in some places, and in others is seen only as the 
result of subsequent erosion.' 1 As illustrative of this, he gave the 
figure reproduced here. (Fig. 106.) 

The idea thus advanced seems to have been contagious, for in 
the same report Holmes described the Sierra El Late as formed 
of a number of distinct 
bodies of trachytic rock 
that had reached their 
present horizon through 
closely associated vents, 
frequently bending up e 
the sedimentary rocks at 
a high angle around the 
borders, the upturned 
strata including the 
lower part of the Middle 
Cretaceous shales and 
portions of the Dakota 
sandstone. His obser- 
vations tended to show, 
to quote his own words, 
""that there had been a 
sort of absorption, so to 
speak, of the shales, and 
that at least half of the 
space through which the 
trachyte is distributed is 
occupied by the crushed 
and metamorphosed 
fragments of shale. As a consequence the height of the arch — such as 
may once have existed — would not equal the height of the trachytic 
mass, as only the higher layers of shale extend entirely over it. His 
idea regarding the formation of this mountain can be best understood 
by reference to tig. 107, copied from Plate l»i in the report for 1875." 
(See further on p. 622.) 

«The views regarding this: method of mountain formation were subsequently 
summed up by Peale in an article, On a Peculiar Type of Eruptive Mountains in 
Colorado, which was published in No. 3 of the Bulletins of the Geological Survey, 
May 15, 1877.

Serf ion skowinff probable method of intrusion of masses 
of* trachyte . 



In the season of 1876 C. A. White was at work in northwest Colo- 
rado, including 1 the area lying between the Uinta and Park ranges. 
F. M. Endlich was engaged in the survey of the White River district, 
A. C. Peale of the Grand River district, and W. H. Holmes of the 
Sierra Abajo and West Miguel mountains. 

In the interval between the issue of the reports for 1875 and 1876 
Hayden, at the suggestion of King, had decided to call the transition 
group, heretofore referred to by him as Lignitic and the exact geolog- 
ical position of which was still in dispute, the Laramie group. 

The report of this year contained little that is new or striking, the 

^ work resulting mainly in 

an extension of our knowl- 
edge of the geographic 
range of various geological 
formations. White, work- 
ing in the Uinta region, 
aptly compared the struc- 
ture of Junction Mountain 
to a displacement which 
might be illustrated by the 
action of a large punch 
worked by machinery, the 
perforated heavy iron 
plates being somewhat 
torn in places and nowhere 
clearly cut through in the 
process of punching. The 
work of White this year 
as a whole confirmed the 
view held by Hayden that 
these lignitic or Laramie 
beds, as they are now 
called, are of a transitional 
nature. 

The field work for Colo- 
rado was completed in 1876. The following year (1877) the work was 
extended northward into Idaho and Wyoming. The geological work 
was, as before, assigned to Drs. F. M. Endlich and A. C. Peale, with 
the addition of Orestes St. John. Endlich worked in

of Cambridge, Massachusetts, accompanied the party for a time, 
making valuable botanical collections. 

St. John noted the overturned character of a portion of the Caribou 
Range and made numerous sections across the Teton Range. Peale 
noted that in the region of the Blackfoot Basin the structure was that 
of a series of anticlinal and synclinal folds, the streams sometimes 
occupying the synclines and sometimes the monoclines. Also that 
there were at least three parallel anticlinal axes having the general 
direction northwest and southeast. 

Hayden's twelfth and last annual report, bearing date of 1879 (1883), 

was issued in the form of two volumes of upward of twelve hundred 

pages, and included the work of the corps for the field season of 1878 

and the office work until the closing up of the survey,

Wyoming, lo7!>. * 

The headquarters of the survey were at Cheyenne, 
Wyoming, as in previous years, and but four 
parties organized. The geological work was 
under the charge of W. H. Holmes. A. C. 
Peale, and Orestes St. John, and the pale- 
ontological work under Dr. C. A. White. 
Mr. Holmes made a general survey of the 
park, while Peale, assisted by J. E. Mush- 
back, was occupied in making detail studies 
of the geyser and hot-spring localities. 

The party, with St. John as geologist, 
surveyed the Wind River Mountains and a 
portion of the Wyoming and Gros Ventre 
ranges. The work of the topographic party 
in the Wind River and Grand Teton re- 
gions was hampered by their being robbed 
of all their animals and a portion of their outfit by hostile bands of 
Indians. 

During the summer of 1877 Prof. S. H. Scudder, with a party, 
visited the Tertiaiy lake basin at Florissant and made an extensive 
collection of fossil insects, the published descriptions of which have 
made this region classic. 

The two volumes mentioned are almost monographic as far as the

Hall, and in the spring of 1853, together with F. B. Meek, went to the 
Bad Lands of the upper Missouri to make collections, as already 
noted. This trip marked the beginning not only of his scientific 
career but also that of his association with Meek, which lasted until 
the latter's death in 1S7(>, and, incidentally, furnished an example of 
uninterrupted collaboration without a counterpart in the history of 
American geology.

AMERICAN GEOLOGY SURVEYS UNDER HAYDEN. 605 

Hayden's scientific career, so promisingly begun, was, however, inter- 
rupted by the outbreak of the civil war, when he promptly volunteered, 
entering the Union army as an assistant surgeon and gradually rising 
to become post-surgeon and surgeon in chief to the Twenty-second 
Division of Cavalry. In June, 1865, he resigned from the army, but 
was subsequently breveted lieutenant-colonel for meritorious conduct. 
In the same year he was elected professor of geology and mineralogy 
in the University of Pennsylvania, holding this chair until 1872, when 
he was forced to resign, owing to his rapidly increasing duties in con- 
nection with the Geological Survey. 

In 1879, after the consolidation of the various surveys. Doctor Hay- 
den was appointed one of the geologists on the new organization. Dur- 
ing the next four years his time was devoted mainly to the completion 
of the business and final publication of the reports of the Geological 
and Geographical Survey of the Territories. His health began failing 
soon after his acceptance of this position, and in .June. lss w J. at his own 
request, he was relieved from the work of supervision of printing the 
reports and assigned to duty in the held, spending the summers of 
1883-ISsh in Montana. His disease {locomotor ataxia), however, grew 
steadily upon him, and in 1886 he resigned on account of complete 
incapacity for duty, thus closing a career of nearly thirty years of 
actual service as naturalist, surgeon, and geologist in connection with 
the Government. 

The apparent diffidence which impressed Doctor Hayden's fellow- 
students at Oberlin, and led them to be doubtful as to his future course 
in life, characterized his maturer years, and to those not well acquainted 
with him made it difficult to account for his success. However, enthu- 
siasm, perseverance, and energy were qualities equally characteristic 
of him all his life, and what seemed to be diffidence was largel}" the 
result of his nervous temperament. The secret of his success is to be 
found in his enthusiastic frankness and his energetic determination to 
carry through whatever he undertook. He was absorbed in the work 
of the Geological Survey and bent all his energies to its success. 
Excitable in temperament and frequently impulsive in action, he was 
generous to a fault, and, although ever ready to defend what he believed 
to be right, he was willing upon the presentation of evidence to modify 
his views. 

He was always careful to give due credit to all who had worked in 
the fields he afterwards explored. In one of his reports, speaking of 
those who had preceded him, he says: 

Any man who regards the permanency or endurance of his own reputation witl not 
ignore any of those frontiersmen who made their early explorations under circum- 
stances of great danger and hardship. 

The same spirit actuated him in his treatment of his subordinates 
and co-workers. His honesty and integrity were undoubted and his 
work for the Government and for science was a labor of love. 



606 KEPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

The following extract is from an article by Dr. Archibald Geikie, 
then director of the Geological Survey of Great Britain: 

There can be no doubt that among the names of those who have pioneered in the 
marvelous geology of western North America that of F. V. Hayden will always 
mold a high and honored place. This place will be his due not only because of his 
own personal achievements in original exploration. His earlier work exhibits much 
of that instinctive capacity for grasping geological structure which is the main 
requisite for a field geologist. He had a keen "eye for country." But he likewise 
possessed the art of choosing the best men for his assistants and the tact of attracting 
them to himself and his corps. In this way he accomplished much excellent work, 
keeping himself latterly in the background so far as actual personal geological inves- 
tigations were concerned, and contenting himself with the laborious task of organi- 
zation and supervision while he encouraged and pushed forward his coadjutors. a 

In an obituary notice of Doctor Hayden, read before the American 
Philosophical Society, Prof. J. P. Lesley, who had known him for 
many years, pays him the following tribute: 

He represented in science the curiosity, the intelligence, the energy, the practical 
business talent of the western people. In a few years they came to adopt him as 
their favorite son of science. He exactly met the wants of the Great West. There 
was a vehemence and a sort of wildness in his nature as a man which won him suc- 
cess, cooperation, and enthusiastic reputation among all classes, high and low, 
wherever he went. In the wigwam, in the cabin, and in the court-house he was 
equally at home, and entirely one with the people. He popularized geology on the 
grandest scale in the new States and Territories. He easily and naturally affiliated 
with every kind of explorer, acting with such friendliness and manly justice toward 
those whom he employed as his coworkers that they pursued with hearty zeal the 
development of his plans. 

In dealing with the public men of the country he was so frank, forcible, and direct 
that it was impossible to suppress or resist him. He had the western people at his 
back so heartily and unanimously that he was for a long time master of the scientific 
situation at Washington. He was a warm personal friend of some of the highest 
officials of the Government, who never failed to support strenuously and success- 
fully his surveys. 

I think that no one who knows the history of geology in the United States can fail 
to recognize the fact that the present magnificent United States Geological Survey, 
now under the direction of Major Powell, is the legitimate child of Doctor Hayden's 
Territorial surveys. 

According to Cope, 6 the Sioux Indians gave to Hayden the name 
"The-man-who-picks-up-rocks-running,' , a name which was certainly 
descriptive of the manner in which much of his work was necessarily 
done. The same writer states that at one time, when engaged in the 
exploration of the Laramie beds of the upper Missouri, he was pur- 
sued and finally overtaken by a band of hostile Indians. Finding him 
armed only with a hammer and carrying a bag of rocks and fossils, 
which they emptied out and examined with much surprise and curi- 
osity, they concluded he was insane and let him alone.

AMERICAN GEOLOGY SURVEY UNDER KING. 607 

F. B. Meek, Hayden's collaborator, was born of Irish parentage in 
the city of Madison, Indiana, in 1817, and during- 1848-49 served 
as assistant to I). D. Owen on the surveys of Iowa, Wisconsin, and 
Minnesota. Afterwards (from 1852-1858) he was assist- 
sketch of Meek. ant to James Hall at Albany, New York, and for a 
portion of the time connected with the geological sur- 
vey of Missouri with Prof. G. C. Swallow. As noted elsewhere, he 
became early associated with Hayden, and, though refusing to become 
officially connected with the survey, was tacitly associated with him 
until the time of his death. Indeed, all the invertebrate fossils col- 
lected by Hayden in his western explorations were studied and the 
results prepared for publication by Meek, although appearing mainly 
under the joint name of Meek and Hayden. 

On leaving Albany in 1858 Meek came to Washington, where he 
resided during the remainder of his life, having a room in the Smith- 
sonian building. He was moderately tall and rather slender in build, 
with a dignified bearing, though quite diffident. During the latter 
part of his life he was also deaf, which caused him to avoid social 
gatherings almost altogether. He was never a man of robust health; 
indeed, during a large part of his life he was more or less an invalid. 
Genial, sincere, pure-minded, and honorable, such are the adjectives 
applied to him by his biographer. With the exception of James Hall, 
he is perhaps tin 1 most widely known of American paleontologists. 
Indeed, had Meek possessed the tremendous physique of Hall or the 
nervous energy of Hayden, he might have stood alone head and 
shoulders above most, if not all, his contemporaries. As it was, he 
did his best work only in the service of, or in collaboration with 
others, never as an organizer or leader. It is true that in his first 
expedition (under the patronage of Hall) to the Bad Lands he out- 
ranked Hayden, and that in numerous instances his work was of a 
higher order. Yet his mildness of character and lack of disposition 
to assert himself, until perhaps too late, caused him to almost invaria- 
bly occupy a second place in any organization with which he was 
connected. 

THE FORTIETH PARALLEL SURVEY UNDER CLARENCE KING. 

In 1867 there was established by Congressional action, and almost 
wholly through the personal efforts of Clarence King, what has 
since been known as the Geological Survey of the Fortieth Parallel. 
„ , This, though subject to the administrative control of 

King's Survey of the tt 1

the immediate direction of King, to whom must be 
given almost the entire credit of its inception and successful execution. 
The immediate excuse for the survey was the desirability of ascer- 
taining the character of the mineral resources of the country to be

traversed by the Pacific Railroad. The region explored, however, 
was a very extended one, reaching from the eastern Colorado range to 
the Sierra Nevadas, with an average width of about 100 miles along 
the fortieth parallel. 

» The plan of the work, as outlined by Emmons," contemplated making 
a topographical map of the region on the general plan of those made 
at the present time, i. e., one on which the topography was indicated 
by contour lines rather than hachures on the hillsides, the then pre- 
vailing custom. The scale adopted was 4 miles to the inch, and the 
original area divided into three rectangular blocks or atlas sheets, each 
about 165 miles in length by 100 miles in width. " Subsequently two 
more blocks were surveyed, making the total area surve}ed and 
mapped some 82,500 square miles. 

The party, according to the author above quoted, rendezvoused in 
California in the early part of the summer of 1867, and began their 
work at the east base of the Sierras in August, with J. D. Hague, 
Arnold Hague, and S. F. Emmons as geological assistants. Though 
tew in number, the force was beyond question the best equipped of 
any that had thus far entered the field of American geology. 

The winter of 1867-68 was spent at Virginia City, Nevada, in the 
stud} 7 of the Comstock Lode, the mines of which, then but 1,000 feet 
in depth, had already produced some one hundred millions of dollars. 
The results of this work appeared in J. D. Hague's monograph, The 
Mining Industry, published in 1870. 

During the season of 1868 the work of the survey was pushed east- 
ward entirely across the Great Basin to the western shore of Great 
Salt Lake. In that of 1869 the desert ranges of Utah, the Wasatch, 
and the western end of the Uinta ranges were surveyed. This com- 
pleted the work as originally planned, and with headquarters at New 
Haven, the task of working up the collections and platting the topo- 
graphic and geologic notes was undertaken. 

This work was, however, abruptly interrupted in the summer of 
1870 by telegraphic orders from General Humphrey, directing the 
party to once more take the field, Congress, without solicitation, hav- 
ing appropriated money for the continuation of the survey. It being 
then too late in the season to prepare the necessary outfit for work in 
the high mountain regions east of the Wasatch, the season was devoted 
to a study of the extinct volcanoes, Mount Shasta, Mount Rainier, 
and Mount Hood. Among the results of this study was the discoveiy 
of the first-known active glaciers within the limits of the United 
States. 

During the summers of 1871-72 the survey was carried eastward to 
the Great Plains and included an examination of the Eocene beds of

the Green River Basin, the Uinta and Elk Mountains and the inter- 
vening Mesozoic and Tertiary valleys of the North Park and the Lar- 
amie Plains, the Medicine Bow Range, and the northern extension of 
the Front Range. 

The survey made no annual or preliminary reports, and as the 
thorough study of the data collected consumed several years of time, 
some of the results obtained were anticipated by other organizations 
through priority of publication. 

The published reports, which appeared in the form of quarto vol- 
umes, named in the order of their appearance, were: Vol. Ill, Mining 
Industry, by James D. Hague, 1870; Vol. V, Botanj 7 , by Sereno Wat- 
son, 1871; Vol. VI, Microscopical Petrography, by Ferdinand Zirkel, 
1876; Vol. II, Descriptive Geology, by Arnold Hague and S. F. 
Emmons, 1*77: Vol. IV, consisting of Parts 1 and 2, Paleontology, 
by F. B. Meek. James Hall, and R. P. Whitfield, and Part 3, Orni- 
thology, by Robert Ridgeway. 1877; Vol. I. 
Sytematic Geology, b} 7 Clarence King, 1878; 
and Vol. VII, Odontornithes, by O. G. 
Marsh, in 1880. The first volume was ac- 
companied by a geological atlas containing 
ten large double maps. 

To properly summarize the work of the 
survey, as made known in these volumes, 
is a practical impossibility in the space that 
can be devoted to it. It was noted that, 
in the grand total of 120.000 feet of sedi- 
mentary accumulations found, the main 
divisions of Archean, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, 
and Cenozoic were all distinctly outlined by 
divisional periods of marked unconformity. 
Considered as a whole, there was a noteworthy fullness in the geolog- 
ical column, none of the important stratigraphical time divisions being 
wholly wanting, excepting some of the obscure intermediate deposits 
which in other localities have been found lying between the base of 
the Cambrian and the summit of the Archean series. 

From the data furnished by Emmons and Hague, and his own 
observations, King felt himself able to reconstruct with a considerable 
degree of accuracy the topographical configurations of the Archean 
surface, and pictured with great clearness the growth of that portion 
of the American continent included within the area surveyed. He 
conceived that, at the close of the Archean age, there was a great 
mountain system built up of at least two sets of nonconformable 
strata, referred to Laurentian and Huronian, which was coextensive

with the greater part of the. Cordilleras." This, west of 117 20', 
formed a land area and to the eastward a sea bottom, upon which last, 

throughout the entire 
Paleozoic period, were 
conformably deposited 
the gradually accumu- 
lating detritus from the 
land, brought down by 
eastward-flowing rivers. 
These Paleozoic sedi- 
ments he found in the 
region of the Wasatch 
to be 32,000 feet in 
thickness, and in the 
extreme western limit, 
upward of 40,000 feet. 

He divided the series 
into four great groups: 
The first, which is pure- 
ly detrital, being wholly 
of Cambrian age; the 
second, a limestone 
series of 11,000 feet in 
thickness, extending 
from the Cambrian to 
the top of the lower Coal 
Measures, and indicat- 
ing a deep-sea deposit. 
Succeeding this came 
the Weber quartzite — a 
purely siliceous deposit 
of from six to ten thou- 
sand feet in thickness — 
followed by the fourth 
group of upper Coal 
Measure limestone, 
about two thousand feet 
in thickness. The en- 
tire Paleozoic series he 
summed up as composed 
of materials of two 
periods of mechanically

bordering the Pacific front of North America, hunting the term Rocky Mountains to

AMERICAN GEOLOGY SURVEY UNDER KING. 611 

accumulated detritus, interrupted by one and followed by another 
period of deep-sea limestone formation. 

At the close of this great conformable period of Paleozoic deposi- 
tion there were widespread mechanical disturbances. All the thickest 
part of the sediments, from the western shore line eastward to and 
including what is now the Wasatch, were raised above the ocean level 
to become a land area. East of the Wasatch the ocean bottom, with 
its Upper Carboniferous sediments, remained practically undisturbed. 

Contemporaneous with or immediately succeeding this uplift, the 
old land mass to the westward went down. What was sea bottom had 
become land, and what was land became sea bottom. But the new 
land area extending from the Wasatch westward to the Havallah 
range (long. 117° 30'), under the combined action of heat, cold, and 
mechanical action of the atmosphere, began at once to yield the 
materials which, in the form of sand and silt, were carried west and 
cast to be laid down, in the first-named instance on a gradually sink- 
ing Archean bottom, until a thickness of 20,000 feet was reached, and 
in the last named, conformably upon a bottom of Upper Carboniferous 
rocks, until some 3,S00 feet had accumulated. 

At the close of this period of sedimentation, which includes the 
Triassic and Jurassic, the Western ocean with its twenty-odd thousand 
feet of sediments underwent a sharp folding and uplifting, whereby 
the shore line was pushed outward as far as the western base of the 
present Sierra Nevadas. The force causing this uplifting acted tan- 
gentially and was most severe in the extreme western portion, i. e., 
the Sierras, where, in a belt of about 50 miles width, the Triassic and 
Jurassic sediments were crumpled and crowded together and crushed 
into a mass of almost undistinguishable folds. During all this power- 
ful disturbance in the Western sea, the region east of the Wasatch 
remained practically undisturbed, as before. 

King's views regarding the geographic distribution of land and 
water during the subsequent period of geological history were largely 
in harmony with those of Hayden. During the Cretaceous times he 
believed a Mediterranean ocean to have stretched from the eastern 
base of the Wasatch into Kansas. Over the bottom of that body of 
water an almost continuous conformable sheet of Cretaceous sedi- 
ments was laid down, the greatest thickness of which was against the 
western shore of the ocean — that is, along- the base of the Wasatch, 
where were found, conformably over the Jurassic shales, about 12,000 
feet of Cretaceous beds. 

With the close of the Cretaceous period of sedimentation the entire 
area from and including the Wasatch, eastward as far as the Missis- 
sippi Valley was uplifted, and in its western portion faulted or thrown 
into sharp or gently undulating folds. The immediate effect of this 
uplifting was, first, the development of the broad level region now 



612 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



occupied by the Great Plains; secondly, the outlining of the basin of 
the Vermilion Creek (Wasatch) Eocene lake; thirdly, the formation 
of the distinct folds of which the Wasatch and Uintas are the most 
prominent examples; and fourthly, the relative upheaval of the old 
Archean ranges, with all their superincumbent load. The folds of 
the Wasatch involved a conformable series of strata extending from 
the base of the Cambrian to the top of the Cretaceous — in all, 44,000 

feet in thickness. The 
astonishing and almost 
incredible feature of the 
case lies in the fact that, 
if King's ideas are to be 
accepted, this stupen- 
dous fold, together with 
the one of 30,000 feet 
forming the Uintas, was 
not a gradual uplift, but 
of sudden and necessa- 
rily catastrophic origin, 
and that, before the 
forces of erosion had ac- 
complished their work, 
there actually here ex- 
isted mountain ranges 
from 5 to 8 miles in 
height." From the date 
of this elevation no ma- 
rine waters have ever 
invaded the middle Cor- 
dilleras, the subsequent 
strata being, as noted by 
Hay den, of lacustrine 
origin. 

Studying in detail the 
underlying geology, in 
connection with these 
folds, King announced 
the principle "that 
wherever an Archean mountain range underlay the subsequent sheets 
of sediment, there a true fold has taken place;" and further, that 
when one observes " the continuity of the strata across such a valley 

« King's exact words are: So that, since the ocean level was banished to some- 
where near its present position, the fold itself (i. e., the Wasatch) was not less than 
44,000 feet in altitude. The Uinta was not so imposing a body, but its summit, 
before erosion began, was certainly 30,000 feet above the sea level. (Systematic 
Geology, p. 748. )

as that of the Laramie Plains, and then sees them sharply and sud- 
denly rise against the foothills of the Archean, it becomes evident that 
the entire area of the Rocky Mountains has suffered actual lateral 
compression, and that the diminution of surface amounts to from 6 to 
lo per cent." When he further considered that the post-Archean 
sedimentaries were to be regarded as a mere thin covering over the 
subjacent crust, he added that "'this diminution of area of actual 
surface means an actual compression of the solid Archean shell of 
the earth. 11 

Pursuing the same line of thought, King noted that the configuration 
of America to-day is due to the configuration or topography of the 
pre-Cambrian continent. Where Archean faults or mountain chains 
existed, there were the lines of weakness along which later orographic 
movements made themselves manifest. A comparatively thin coating 
of sedimentary beds, foi illustration, overlies the generally smooth 
Archean rocks of the Mississippi Valley, and here no subsequent dis- 
turbances have taken place. On the other hand, the high Archean 
Wasatch ridges, which were covered by 10,00Q feet of sediment in 
post-Archean times, were again and again uplifted during the subse- 
quent periods of disturbance. 

It was noted above that, at the close of the post-Cretaceous uplifting, 
the Wasatch highland stood at an elevation of upwards of 40,000 feet. 
Under such extraordinary conditions rapid and intense erosion was 
inevitable, and in a comparatively brief period, geologically, the Ver- 
milion Creek Eocene lake was tilled with sediments derived therefrom 
to a depth of 5,000 feet. 

Then ensued another period of disturbance, by which the western 
portion of these Vermilion Creek beds w T as upturned, while the 
region to the immediate west, from which their sediments had been 
derived, was as suddenly depressed, allowing the waters of the lake to 
extend themselves 200 miles westward into Nevada. 

Another series of crustal movements was now inaugurated in the 
east, whereby the Great Plains land area also underwent a subsidence, 
which was most pronounced along the foothills of the Rocky Moun- 
tains and gradually died out to the eastward. This movement marks 
the dividing line between the Eocene and the Miocene periods. Con- 
temporaneously with this the entire Great Basin area, including por- 
tions of Washington, Oregon, Nevada, and California, lying to the 
east of the Sierras and the present Cascade Range, became depressed, 
and, receiving the drainage of the surrounding hills and mountains, 
was converted into two large lakes which, throughout the Miocene 
period, were depositories of sediment from the adjacent land. Power- 
ful and profound crustal movements at the close of the Miocene threw 
the beds into folds, but did not apparently raise them above the sur- 
face level of the lake. Contemporaneously with this movement the 



614 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Miocene lake of the east, through the subsidence of the surrounding 
country, was so increased as to cover almost the entire province of the 
Great Plains. 

The beginning of the Pliocene period found, then, two enormous 
fresh-water lakes, the one covering the basin country of Utah, Nevada, 
Idaho, and eastern Oregon, the other occupying the Plains province. 
The period was brought to an end by crustal movement which, how- 
ever, affected the two areas quite differently, the sediments of the 
Great Basin area being broken through the middle and the halves 
depressed from 1,000 to 2,000 feet, while those of the Plains were 
bodily tilted toward the south and east. 

The result of the post-Pliocene movement in the department of the 
Plains was to give thereafter a free drainage .to the sen. The result 
in the area of the Gre"at Basin, on the other hand, was to leave two 
deep depressions, one at the western base of the Wasatch and one at 
the base of the Sierra Nevada, which in Quaternary times received the 
abundant waters of the Glacial period and formed the two now nearly 
extinct lakes known as Lake Lahontan and Lake Bonneville, noted 
elsewhere. 

King was born at Newport, Rhode Island, in 184:2, and graduated 
from the Sheffield Scientific School in 1862, being a member of the 
first class to receive degrees from that institution. The year following 
his graduation he, in company with James T. Gardner, 
sketch of King joined an emigrant train starting from St. Joseph, Mis- 

souri, on an overland trip to California. It is stated that 
it was during this trip, at that time a slow and eventful one, that he con- 
ceived the idea, afterwards carried into execution, of a geological section 
across the entire Cordilleran system. Reaching California, he attached 
himself as a volunteer assistant to the State survey of California, under 
J. D. Whitney. Later he was connected with parties under General 
McDowell in the examination of the mineral resources of the Mariposa 
grant. It was during this expedition that he and his companion were 
captured by Apaches, but were fortunately rescued just as the fires 
were being prepared for their torture. 

After the civil war and the passage of the bill subsidizing the Pacific 
Railroad, King recognized that the time had come for carrying out 
his scheme for connecting the geology of the East with that of the 
West and making the cross section above referred to. With this pro- 
ject in view he went to Washington in the winter of 180*)-»;T, and in 
spite of the disadvantage of his youth — being then scarcely 25 3'ears 
of age, and still more youthful appearance — he was so successful in 
impressing Congress with the importance of ascertaining the character 
of the mineral resources of the country about to be opened that not 
only was a generous annual appropriation voted, but King was him-

self placed in charge, subject only to the administrative control of 
Gen. A. A. Humphrey, as already mentioned. 

The published results of this survey we have already reviewed. As 
described b} 7 Emmons, from whose sketch most of what is here given 
of the personal history of King- is quoted, ''probably no more masterly 
summary of the great truths of geology had been made since the pub- 
lication of Lyell's Principles/' Making due allowance for the enthu- 
siasm of one who was an associate and warm personal friend, attention 
need only be called to the fact that the entire work was consummated 
before its author saw his fortieth birthday, to establish once and for all 
King's fame as an organizer and geologist. 

Aside from the publications under this survey, King's bibliography 
contains few titles, but this may mean simply that neither ink nor 
words were wasted. In 1877 he delivered an address at the thirty-first 
anniversary of the Sheffield Scientific School on Catastrophism and the 
Evolution of Environment, which Emmons characterized as a "pro- 
test against the extreme uniformitarianism of that day." It was 
naturally based largely on his Fortieth Parallel work. This uniform- 
itarianism he described as ""the harmless undestructive rate (of geo- 
logical changes) of to-day prolonged backward into the deep past." 
He contended that while the old belief in catastrophic changes had 
properly disappeared, yet geological history, as he read it, showed 
that the rate of change had not been uniform, as was claimed by the 
later school. He believed rather, as a result of his own observations, 
that at certain periods in geological histoiy the rate of change had 
been accelerated to such a degree that the effect produced upon life 
was somewhat catastrophic in its nature. 

One act in King's professional career should be here referred to, 
although the story has often been told. It will be remembered that in 
1872 there was made a reported discovery of a diamond field in south- 
ern Arizona within an area that had been gone over in the course of 
the work of the Fortieth Parallel Survey. King, for purely scientific 
purposes, undertook a study of the region, with the purpose of dis- 
covering something regarding the matrix and the origin of the dia- 
mond. He discovered, rather, that the whole matter was a stupendous 
fraud; that, so far from there being a diamond mine, the ground had 
been "salted." So soon as this discovery was made King started for 
San Francisco, traveling night and day, that he might outstrip all other 
possible sources of information. On his arrival he at once visited the 
offices of the directors of the company organized for the selling of 
stock, and demanded peremptorily that all issues should be stopped. 
To a suggestion that his announcement of the fraudulent nature of the 
claim be dela} T ed temporarily, he replied: "There is not money enough 
in the Bank of California to induce me to delay this announcement a 
single hour." And it was not delayed.

IT. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEYS WEST OF THE 100TH MERIDIAN UNDER

field seasons, with A. K. Marvine, assistant in 1871, and E. E. Howell, 
in 1872-73. J. J. Stevenson served as geologist with one of the parties 

in 1873, Jules Marcou in 1875, A. R. Conk- 
ling in 1875-1877, and J. A. Church in 1877. 
In 1878-7!' Stevenson was again attached to 
the survey, with I. C. Russell as assistant. 
Oscar Loew served as mineralogical assistant 
during 1871-1875, and E. D. Cope as verte- 
brate paleontologist in 1871. 

The invertebrate paleontological collec- 
tions made by all of the parties were worked 
up by Dr. C. A. White, then connected with 
Bowdoin College, after a preliminary ex- 
amination by F. B. Meek. The results of 
the geological work appeared in the form of 
two quarto volumes, the first, of 681 pages, 
in 1875; and the second, of 120 pages, in 
1881 — the latter with an appendix by Doctor White, comprising 36 
pages of text and 2 plates of fossils. The paleontological report 
proper, comprising the work of both Cope and White, appeared under 
date of 1877, a quarto volume of 599 pages and 83 plates of fossils. 

The first vertebrate fossils from the western Triassic were described 
in this report, the materials having been obtained by Professor New- 
berry when attached to the Macomb expedition in 1855. 

Gilbert applied the names Basin Range system and Basin Ranges to 
all that s} T stem of short mountain ridges separated by trough-like 
valleys which lie west of the plateau system, though not quite coin- 
cident with the Great Basin itself. This basis system of mountain 
uplift he regarded as due mainly to faulting and tilting, in this respect 
differing with the geologists of the. Fortieth Parallel Survey, who

regarded the primary features as due to folding-, the now evident 
faulting being a phase of late Tertiary or post-Tertiary time." He 
noted that the ranges were parallel, recurring at regular intervals and 
of only moderate dimensions; further, that the ridges of the system 
occupied loci of upheaval, and were not residua of denudation; and 
that the valleys were not valleys of erosion, but mere intervals 
between the lines of maximum uplift. 

He dwelt in considerable detail upon the phenomena of erosion by 
wind-blown sand and silt-laden streams, and discussed the glacial 
phenomena and the conditions attending the drying up of the great 
inland lakes, applying the name Lake Bonneville, in honor of Captain 
Bonneville, the explorer, to the great body of fresh water that once 
occupied Sevier and Salt Lake valleys and of which the present bodies 
of salt water, bearing these latter names are but the tiny residuals. 
Those great bodies of water, which obviously could have existed only 
under conditions of climate quite different from those of to-day, he

believed to be coeval with the Glacial period of the northeastern States. 
He found, however, no counterpart in this region of the general 
glaciation of the eastern States, though there were local glaciers high 
upon the flanks of the mountains. 

The abundant volcanic phenomena presented by the region were dis- 
cussed in considerable detail and the recency of many of the lava flows 
noted, the conclusions arrived at being to the effect that while "we 
are not merely permitted to think of a renewal of that activity as pos- 
sible * * '"' we are logically compelled to regard it as probable." 

The geological history of the basin region as read by Gilbert was to 
the effect that the area was depressed below sea level from the close of 

a In Chapter VII of the volume on Mining Industry (Vol. Ill, Report, 40th Parallel 
Survey, 1873) King refers incidentally to these mountains as the tops of folds whose 
deep synclinal valleys are filled with Tertiary and Quaternary detritus. Just how 
fully the problem may have been worked out in his own mind at that time is not 
apparent, but in 1878, after the appearance of Gilbert's monograph, he expressed 
the opinion noted above. The entire subject, it may be stated, was gone over by 
J. E. Spurr in a paper read before the Geological Society of America in 1900 (see 
Bull. Geol. Soc. Amer., XII, pp. 217-270), and the matter rediscussed at the winter 
meeting of the same society in Washington in 1902. The prevailing opinions there 
expressed were in accordance with the views put forward by Gilbert in 1875.

the Archean period until late Carboniferous. From the close of the 
Carboniferous to the beginning of the Cretaceous a great area, includ- 
ing the entire plateau country, was covered by the waters of an inland 
sea entirely cut off from the main ocean. Only once did the sea regain 

a temporary sway, bringing with it a Juras- 
sic fauna and then retreating. Throughout 
the Cretaceous age the plateau country was 
the scene of a shallow ocean, the shores of 
which were ever advancing and receding. 
Through the upraising of some remote bar- 
rier the ocean was permanently shut out and 
the inland sea gradually converted into 
an immense fresh-water lake, and finally 
drained till the whole region became ter- 
restrial. Since the expulsion of this sea 
the elevation of the continent which caused 
it has continued, and the plateau country, 
which from early Silurian to late Cretaceous 
times was slowly sinking to an extent of 
not less than 8,000 feet, has been bodily uplifted to its former 
altitude. 

Gilbert called attention to the almost entire absence of Upper Silu- 
rian and Devonian fossils in the region, and described the volcanic 
necks or plugs as vestiges of the flues through which the eruptions 
reached the surface, the last contents con- 
gealing in the flue to be subsequently ex- - - 
posed b} 7 erosion. 

A. R. Marvine, who was attached to the 
party in 1871 as an astronomical assistant, 
was later detailed for geological work, his 
report on the region between Fort Whipple, 
New Mexico, and Tucson, Arizona, occupy- 
ing pages 191-225 of the third volume. 

E. E. Howell, as a member of the survey 
during? 1872-73, worked throughout the first 
season in western Utah and eastern Nevada 
and the plateau region of central Nevada. 
In 1873 he once more entered the plateau 
country and continued upon it to Arizona 

and New Mexico. His report is included in pages 227-300 of the 
same volume. 

The party to which J. J. Stevenson was attached as a geologist was 
assigned in 1873 to work in southern Colorado, the region including 
portions of the drainage areas of the South Platte, Arkansas, Rio 
Grande, San Juan, Grand, and Gunnison rivers.

AMERICAN GEOLOGY SURVEYS UNDER POWELL. 619 

Stevenson devoted considerable attention to a discussion of the geo- 
logical age of the Colorado lignites, which he regarded (Lesquereux 
to the contrary, notwithstanding), as Cretaceous. He agreed with 
J. L. Le Conte in regarding the Rocky Mountains as not the product 
of one upheaval, nor the several axes wholh T synchronous in origin. 
The first great epoch of accelerated disturbance in the Rocky Mountain 
region, resulting in the permanent elevation of the surface, he thought 
to have been synchronous with that during which the Appalachian 
chain was completed. Further, that the second epoch of elevation 
began toward the close of the Triassic. This was followed by a period 
of subsidence during which the Cretaceous beds were laid down, a 
third period of uplift marking the close of the Cretaceous. During 
this latter period volcanic agencies were in a state of intense activity, 
and a vast sheet of lava, two to three thousand feet in thickness, flowed 
out over the whole region of the Grand and Gunnison rivers. During 
the Tertiary period still another elevation took place, sufficient to give 
the rocks of that age a dip of some 5 degrees. 

In his report of the work for 1879 Stevenson discussed in consider- 
able detail the relations of the Laramie group, which he regarded as 
but the upper part of Hayden's Fox Hill group — that is, of very late 
Cretaceous age. He felt that there was no doubt but that the coal 
tields of the Galisteo area and of southern Colorado were of precisely 
the same age as those of northern Colorado and Wyoming. 

THE UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL SURVEYS 

UNDER J. W. POWELL. 

J. W. Powell's first observations on the geology of the Uinta Moun- 
tains were made in 1869, when engaged in his famous exploration of 
the Grand Canyon, already noted. In 1871, 1874, and 1875 he again 
Powell's Geology visited the plateau region, the last year being accom- 
Mo'untains 3 pauied by Dr. C. A. White. The results of these later 

1874-75. years of exploration are given in the quarto mono- 

graph on the Geology of the Eastern Portion of the Uinta Mountains, 
published in 1876. This comprised, all told, 218 pages, with a large 
folio atlas. 

The expedition of 1875 and those of the intervening years until 1880 
were made under the authority of the Department of the Interior, the 
organization, with Powell as director, being known as the second 
division of the U. S. Geological and Geographical Survey of the Terri- 
tories. In 1877 the name was changed to the U. S. Geographical and 
Geological Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region. 

In none of the early Powell surveys was an attempt made at system- 
atic areal work. Certain striking and well-exemplified features were 
selected and made the subject of special monographs. In the work 
of 1876, above noted, Powell divided the region west of the Great

Plains, east of the Sierra Nevada, and south of the North Platte, Sho- 
shone, and Sweetwater rivers into what he designated as geological 
provinces — the Park Province, the Plateau Province, and the Basin 
Province. 

'The first named he described as characterized by broad, massive 
ranges, sometimes distinct and sometimes coalescing, so as to include 
the great parks. The mountains comprise high, lofty, snow-clad 
peaks which form perennial reservoirs for the multitude of streams 
discharging in part into the Colorado River and thence into the 

Gulf of California, and 
in part into the Rio 
Grande and thence 
into the Gulf of Mex- 



ico. 

The Plateau Prov- 
ince he described as 
characterized by many 
tables bounded b} 7 can- 
yon and cliff escarp- 
ments, and on which 
stand lone mountains 
and irregular groups 
of mountains and short 
ranges. This region 
drains almost wholl} T 
into the Colorado 
River. 

The Basin Province 
was characterized by 
short north-and-south 
mountain ranges and 
ridges separated by 
desert valleys, and with a drainage which is almost wholly into the 
interior salt lakes and sinks. 

Devoting himself mainly to the Uintas, he showed that the} T owed 
their present configuration to the degradation of a great upheaved 
block having its axis in an east-and-west direction. This upheaval, 
which he thought took place very slowl} r and gradually, began at the 
close of Mesozoic time and continued with slight intermissions until 
late Cenozoic. The total amount of upheaval in the axial region was 
more than 30,000 feet. Contemporaneously with upheaval the forces 
of degradation were at work, though not at the same rate of progress, 
along the axial line of uplift, the degradation amounting to more than 
25,000 feet (4f miles), and the mean degradation to 3£ miles; so that 
over the entire area of about 2,000 square miles some 7,100 cubic 
miles of rock material have been removed.

During- the years 1874, 1875, and 1876 Capt. Clarence E. Dutton, of 

the Ordnance Department, U. S. Army, made, under direction of the 

Powell survey, further studies in the plateau region which had already 

received attention from Powell, Newberry, and others, 

Dutton's Work on . ' • ' 

the High Plateaus, as previously noted. Dutton s monograph — a Report 
on the Geology of the High Plateaus of Utah, a quarto 
volume of 307 pages, with an atlas — appeared under date of 1880. 
The particular territory studied b} T Dutton lay in Utah, occupying a 
belt of country extending from a point about 15 miles east of Mount 
Nebo, in the Wasatch, south-southwest for about 175 miles, and having 
a breadth of from 25 to 80 miles — a total area of some 9,000 square 
miles. 

As was the case with Powell, as indeed must here be the case with 
every observing man, Dutton was impressed with the evident signs of 
the vast amount of erosion which the country had undergone within 
comparatively recent geological times. Not- 
ing that from an area of 10,000 square miles 
from 6,000 to 10,000 vertical feet of strata 
have been removed, he fell to speculating on 
the probable effect upon the earth's equilib- 
rium of such a transference of materials. 
If the slow accumulation of great masses of 
sediment on sea bottoms brings about a 
gradual subsidence, why should not, he 
argued, the removal of a like load from any 
land area result in a corresponding uplift 
or elevation. Thus, for the second time in 
the history of American geology, was 
broached the now well-known subject of 
isostacy. (Seep. 499.) This great erosion, 
it is well to note, he regarded as having taken place mainly in Miocene 
time, though continuing on into Pliocene. 

He noted that the great structural features of the high plateaus were 
due to faults and monoclinal flexures; also that the one form of dis- 
placement passed continually into the other — that what is here a simple 
fault passed by subdivision, but a few miles farther along in its course, 
into what he designated as step faults, and still farther on into unbroken 
anticlinals. All of these grander displacements belonging to the same 
sj'stem he regarded as having their commencement in the latter part 
of Pliocene times. 

The great amount of volcanic activity evident received attention, 
the most ancient dating back to Eocene times. The character of the 
volcanic products was studied and the various lavas classified as (1) 
propylite, (2) andesite, (3) trachyte, (1) rhyolite, and (5) basalt, 
named here in order of their extrusion. The facts, as a whole, in this

region he believed to be confirmatory of Richthofen's law of the 
sequence of volcanic rocks.® He noted his objections to the German 
method of rock classification based upon geological age. 

In 1876 G. K. Gilbert, then a member of Major Powell's corps, made 
a study of the Henry Mountains of Utah. His report appeared in 

1877 in the form of a quarto 

volume of 160 pages, with five 

folding plates, and 

Gilbert's Work in the ° r ' 

Henry Mountains, numerous plates

and figures in the 
text. In this he showed that these 
mountains were due to the intru- 
sion from below of igneous mat- 
ter through Carboniferous and 
Triassic strata, causing the over- 
lying Cretaceous and Tertiary 
beds to arch or bulge upward, 
the present aspect of the moun- 
tains having resulted from erosion, 
whereb} 7 the overlying bulged 
beds and a portion of the igneous 
rocks as well were cut away. 
Phenomena of this type had been 
previously noted by Holmes, 
Peale, and Marvine, of the Hay- 
den Survey (pp. 601, 602), but it re- 
mained for Gilbert to fully elabor- 
ate the idea, and that in a man- 
ner that must ever connect it with 
his name. To intrusions of this 
type he gave the name of lacco- 
lites. 

In this report Gilbert showed 
that, in the uplifting of the sand- 
stone to form these domes, the 
beds, as in the case of that of the 
Vermilion Cliff sandstone, might 
be elongated as much as 300 feet 
in a distance of three miles. That this could be done, and that sud- 
denly, he believed to be due to the pressure of the overlying beds. 
The material was in a quasi plastic condition, and no fissures could 
be opened unless coincidently filled by some material which would 

«Richthofen divided the Tertiary and post-Tertiary volcanic rocks into the five 
classes given above, and regarded them as having been the product of a regular 
sequence of eruptions, propylite being the most ancient and basalt the most recent.

resist the tendency of the walls to How together. This consideration 
led him to the conclusion that — 

just as for each rock there is a crushing weight, so there is for each rock a certain 
depth at which it can not be fissured. 

Applying this principle to faults and fissure veins he concluded that — 

if the fault extend to a # r eat depth it will finally reach a region where the hardest 
n tcks which it separates are coerced by so great a pressure that they can not h< »ld them- 
selves asunder, but are forced together before the fissure can be tilled by mineral 
deposits. Thus, there ia a definable inferior limit to the region of vein formation. 

This the present writer believes to be the first time the doctrine of 
rock no wage was put forth in America and by an American. 

The matters of instability of drainage lines, planation, and formation 
of river terraces were discussed, and it was shown that Hitchcock's idea 
of the formation of river terraces by successive periodsof sedimentation 
(p. -±6*2) was erroneous, such in fact being but the recorded stages of 
progressive erosion. In this work Gilbert used the terms conseguent, 
(int< cedt nt, and supt rimposed as introduced by Powell, and showed that 
the drainage of the Henry Mountains, while as a whole consequent, 
was not so in all of its details. 

The igneous rocks of the mountains were studied microscopically by 
Capt. C. E. Dutton, who classed them as trachytes. 

Powell was born of English parentage in Mount Morris, New York, 
March 24, 1834, and died September 23, 1902. From childhood he 
manifested a deep interest in all natural phenomena and early gave 
evidence of that bold and self-reliant spirit which 
sketch of Poweii. in later years found vent in his hazardous explora- 

tion of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. Vigor- 
ous, impetuous, and sometimes intolerant of the opinions of others, 
he made warm friends and strong enemies. Rising from obscurity, 
without university training, indeed almost wholly self-taught, to 
become a bold and aggressive thinker, and finally the head of the l T . S. 
Geological Survey in 1881, it is little to be wondered at that he became 
for many a target for sneers as well as an object of envy. But how- 
ever much men may differ as to the value of his individual work in 
the geological as well as ethnological field, no one will for a moment 
question that it was through his efforts that others were given the 
opportunity to carve out their own immortality. Upon his success as 
an administrator his fame may safely rest. 

After his retirement from the Survey in 1894 Powell limited him- 
self mainly to abstruse psychological problems and the directorship 
of the Bureau of American Ethnology, which, it should be said, he 
had been largeby instrumental in founding in 1880. 

Powell served with gallantry during the civil war, rising to the 
rank of major of artillery. He lost his right arm at the battle of 
Pittsburg Landing.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



As early as 1874 the question of the advisability of consolidating 
the various geological and geographical surveys west of the Mississippi 
was considered by a committee of the public lands, to which Congress 

had referred a message of the President of the United 
the Geological States relating to the matter. The committee made 

exhaustive investigations, receiving testimony from 
many interested parties, and undoubtedly a strong effort was. made to 
have the surveys conducted under the direction of the United States 
Army. In opposition to this was successfully arrayed almost the 
unanimous opinion of the scientific and professional men of the 
countiy. In 1878 the matter was again brought up, with the result 
of consolidating all of the various surveys under the U. S. Geologi- 
cal Survey, of which Clarence King was appointed director in 1879. 
Mr. King, however, held the office but a single year, resigning in 
favor of Maj. J. W. Powell.

The Moody Footmark Quarry, South Hadley, Massachusetts. 



(HAP T E R VIII. 

THE FOSSIL FOOTPRINTS OF THE CONNECTICUT VALLEY. 

In the American Journal of Science for 1<S:->C> Prof. Edward Hitch- 
cock described a series of fossil footprints occurring in the sandstone 
of the Connecticut Valley, attention to which had been culled by Dr. 
JameS Deane, of Greenfield, the latter's notice having been first 
directed to them by a Mr. Dexter Marsh, of Deerfield, who found 
them among- some flagstones being laid in front of his house. Deane, 
who was a practicing physician, was quick to realize their geological 
interest and apparently also recognized his own inability to do the 
matter justice, and so referred them to Doctor Hitchcock. 

Those first found were from a quarry in Montague; later finds were 
made at the so-called Lily Pond quarry at Turners Falls, a quarry 
which has yielded in the past and still occasionally yields the finest 
examples yet produced. Hitchcock described and figured tracks which 
he regarded as having been made by as many as seven different species 
of animals. His conclusions regarding their origin were, first, that 
they were all the impressions of biped animals; second, that they could 
not have been made by any known biped except birds, and third that 
they well corresponded with the tracks of birds in having the same 
ternary division of the feet, with frequently, and perhaps always, the 
toes terminated with claws, as do birds. To these supposed bird tracks 
he gave the name Ornithichnites (from opv is and r/jroo"), signifying 
stony bird tracks. Five years of further examination enabled him to 
swell the list of species to 27, which were described and figured, natural 
size, in his final report on the geology of Massachusetts, 1841. 

Up to this last date he had found no certain evidence that any of the 
tracks were made by quadrupeds, yet a considerable proportion of 
them bore so strong a resemblance to saurian reptiles that he denomi- 
nated them sauroidichnites, or tracks resembling those of saurians, 
intending, however, by the term merely to convey an intimation that 
they might prove reptilian. To the others he now applied the name 
ornithoidichnites, or tracks resembling those of birds. To animal 
tracks of all kinds, and of whatever nature he proposed the general 
name ichnolites. 

At the April meeting, 1842, of the American Association of Geolo- 
gists, Hitchcock brought the matter up once more, describing five 
new species, one of which, 0. tubt mw, from Pompton, New Jersey, 
was the first thus far found outside of the Connecticut Valley.

In this same paper he also announced the finding of tracks which 
afforded the first "certain evidence that any of the numerous tracks 




upon the sandstone of the Connecticut Valle}' were made b} r a quad- 
ruped,' 1 though he had suspected that such might be the case. These 
probable quadrupedal tracks he described under the name Sauroidich-

nites deweyi, and it was suggested that they were comparable with the 
Cheiotheritmi, an amphibian found in the European Keuper beds 
(Triassic). This discovery, naturally, raised again the question as to 
the possible quadrupedal nature of the others described, but, with 
characteristic conservatism, he still refrained from committing him- 
self, simply noting that it would be "contrary to the cautious spirit 
of science" to decide on the evidence then at hand as to their exact 
nature, and he therefore adhered to the course adopted in his previous 
report, and classified all under the names as onvithoidichnites and 
sauroidichnites, as before. 

It is scarcely necessary to remark that the discovery of these tracks 
excited a very lively interest both at home and abroad, and references 
and suggestions regarding them multiplied in the geological literature 
of the day. Thus, in the American Journal of Science, XLV, 1843, 
under the title of Ornithichnites of the Connecticut River Sandstones 
and the Dinornis of New Zealand, we find given the opinions of 
Deane, Hitchcock, Mantell, and Richard Owen regarding their nature. 
Deane, in a letter to Doctor Mantell, of London, had written: 

These beautiful fossils, indicating a high grade of animal existence in a period of 
the earth so immensely remote, may well be regarded among the wonders of paleon- 
tological science. * * * That the footsteps of the Connecticut River are, how- 
ever, the authentic traces of extinct birds is confirmed by the undeviating compari- 
sons they bear to living nature. 

He wrote further of referring these footprints, as discovered by 
himself, to Professors Silliman and Hitchcock, both of whom admitted 
the plausibility of his statements, } r et remained incredulous as to the 
inferences drawn until accurate models were submitted to them, when 
Professor Hitchcock had pronounced his unqualified conviction that 
the footprints were those of birds. Doctor Mantell in his reply to 
Doctor Deane seems to have himself accepted the opinion of their 
bird-like nature, and stated further that at first both Professors Owen 
and Murchison were in doubt as to whether they were made by birds 
or reptiles. Mr. Lyell, however, stated his conviction that they were 
genuine orn itfyichnites. Later, Professor Murchison, after considering 
the enormous size of the tracks which must have been made by the 
New Zealand moas, " confessed that the gigantic bones from New 
Zealand, evincing as they did most unequivocal^ the existence even 
in our own times of birds as large as any required by the American 
footmarks, had removed his skepticism, and that he had no hesitation 
in declaring his belief that the ornithichnites had been produced by 
the imprints of the feet of birds which had walked over the rocks 
when in a soft and impressible state." "An opinion," adds Mantell, 
"in which I entirely concur." 

Dr. Richard Owen, too, in a letter to Professor Silliman, under date 
of March 16, 1813, after calling attention to the need of caution in

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



assuming' the existence of highly organized birds at so early a period, 
particularly when there were known to be large reptiles which might 
make tracks very similar, went on to speak of the then recently 
described Dinornis" of New Zealand, and wrote as follows: 

It seems most reasonable, therefore, to conclude that the ornithichnites are the 
impressions of feet of birds which had the same low grade of organization as the 
Apteryx and Dinornis of New Zealand, and this Jatter may be regarded as the last 
remnants of an apterous race of birds which seems to have flourished in the epoch 
of the New Red sandstone of Connecticut and Massachusetts. 

The concluding paragraph in the article from which these abstracts 
have been made is interesting as showing the unqualified acceptation 
by Murchison of the opinions by the various authorities. Thus, he is 
quoted as having said: 

From this moment, then, I am prepared to admit the value of the reasoning of 
Doctor Hitchcock and of the original discoverer, Dr. James Deane, who, it appears 
by the clear and modest paper laid before us (by Doctor Mantell), was the first per- 
son to call the attention of the professor to the phe- 
nomenon, expressing then his own belief, from what 
he saw in existing nature, that the footprints were 
made by birds. Let us now hope, therefore, that 
the last vestiges of doubt may be removed by the 
discovery of the bones of some fossil Dinornis. In 
the meantime let us honor the great moral courage of 
Professor Hitchcock in throwing down his opinions 
before an incredulous public. 

About this time Doctor Deane, evidently 
becoming dissatisfied with the position he 
was likely to occupy in the discussion, be- 
gan to himself publish descriptions, his first 
paper appearing in the American Journal 
of Science, XL VI, 1844, where he figured 
a slab some 6 by 8 feet in dimensions con- 
taining over 75 impressions. He did not, however, attempt any scien- 
tific description of the same, and referred to them as Ornithichnites 
fylicoides, of Hitchcock. 

In a paper read before the American Association of Geologists and 
Naturalists at Washington in May, 1844, Doctor Hitchcock took the 
subject up once more and gave a brief history of the discovery of foot- 
prints in other countries, and also certain data regarding an earlier 
discovery than that of Doctor Deane, referring to the fact that in 1802 
Mr. Pliny Moody, of South Hadley, in Massachusetts, had turned up 
with the plow upon his father's farm in that place a stone containing 
in relief five tracks of what he, Hitchcock, now referred to as Ornith- 

" Bones of the Dinornis, the giant bird of New Zealand, it should be mentioned, 
first came to the notice of the scientific world through the publications of Richard 
Owen, the English anatomist, in 1839-184.!.

ichnites fulicoides. This sumo slab served for several years the pur- 
pose of a doorstep, and finally passed into the possession of Doctor 
Hitchcock in 1839. 

An evident feeling- of jealousy oetween tne two gentlemen most 
concerned is for the lirst time manifested in this paper, a feeling 
which apparently existed until the time of Doctor Deane's death, and 
which caused his friends to publish in 1861 the volume entitled Iehno- 
graphs of the Sandstone of Connecticut River, a quarto volume of 61 
pages of text and -16 full-page plates. 

Hitchcock covered the entire subject up to the date of his reading 
this paper (1841), and described the fine large specimen found in the 
impure limestone of Chicopee Falls, in Springfield, under the name of 
Omithoidichnites redjleldii, and also several other new species. The 
resemblance of these to saurian remains was still recognized, but the 
proof was not regarded as sufficient to refer them unequivocally to 
quadrupeds. 

In this paper Hitchcock adopted the following classification for 
tracks or markings of various kinds: 

Order 1. Polypodichnites, or many-footed tracks. 

Order 2. Tetrapodichnites, or four-footed trucks. 

Order 3. Dipodichnites, or two-footed tracks. 

Order 4. Apodichnites, or footless tracks. 

Under the latter term he included certain marks made by fishes, 
mollusks, and annelid worms. 

In the American Journal of Science for 1845, Doctor Deane had two 
papers descriptive of footprints found by him and a part of which he 
thought to be undoubtedly those of batrachians, agreeing in this respect 
with Hitchcock, as noted above. In his second paper he described 
and figured tracks made by a batrachian reptile, the method of pro- 
gression of which, as indicated by the tracks, was by kangaroo-like 
jumps, the fore limbs not touching the ground. Again, in 1847, 
Deane had a paper dealing not merely with the tracks, but also with 
the supposed conditions under which they were formed, the tracks 
described being in part those of birds and in part those of quadrupeds. 
Their preservation he regarded as due to the resubmergence during 
seasons of flood of the mud flats upon which they were formed. 

Through the same medium and this same year Hitchcock reverted 
once more to the subject and described two new species of thick-toed 
bipeds, the one renamed Brontozoum (from Ornithoidichiiites) sitti- 
manium, and the other B. parallelum. In connection with these he 
described a large and extraordinary track regarded as that of a batra- 
chian and to which he gave the generic name Otozoum. He regarded 
the tracks as having been preserved by being silted in by the waves of 
spring tides. 



630 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Again, in 1848, Doctor Dearie came forward with a brief paper and 
figures of tracks which he thought might with propriety he referred 
to some member of the tailed or salamandrian family of batrachians, 
since he discovered markings which seemed to him as probably due 
to the trailing of the caudal appendage. In this same year Dexter 
Marsh, the man who first called Doctor Deane's attention to the foot- 
prints in 1836, in a long letter to the editor of Silliman's Journal, 
described and figured footprints which he regarded as those of a 
quadruped and one that walked step by step and not by leaps. 

Previous to the forties Hitchcock had given names only to the 
tracks, but in 1815, aeting under the suggestion made to him b}' Doe- 
tor Deane, he presented, at the meeting of the Association of Ameri- 
can Geologists, a catalogue of the animals themselves, so far as known, 
a plan to which he adhered and defended in his paper in the Memoirs 
of the American Acadeni}- of Arts and Sciences, presented in 1818. 
In this paper he discussed with his usual caution the possibilities of 
identification and classification from footprints alone, and while he 
acknowledged that he had no great confidence in the arrangement 
adopted except in a few instances, went on to submit the following list 
of yenera:

Under these names he described 19 species, of which he regarded 12 
as certainly quadrupeds: 1 probably lizards, 2 chelonians or turtles, 
and 6 batrachians. Two were annelids or mollusks; 3 of doubtful 
character; and the remaining 32 species were bipeds. Eight of these 
32 he regarded as being thick-toed tridactylous birds; 11 others were 
probably narrow-toed tridactylous or tetradactylous birds; 2 were 
perhaps bipedal batrachians, and the remaining 8 he thought might 
have been birds, but would more probably turn out to be either 
lizards or batrachians. 

It ma}' be noted, in this connection that, in 1815, Dr. Alton King 
found fossil footprints in Carboniferous sandstone in Westmoreland 
County, Pennsylvania. These, though now known to have been tracks of 
amphibians, were described b} 7 King under the names of Ornithichnites 
gallimdoides and 0. culbertsoni, King accepting their birdlike origin, 
though assuring the reader that the "popular error that these are the 
tracks of wild turkevs needs no discussion." Certain other tracks

found at the same time were recognized as those of quadrupeds, and 
wore described under the generic name of Spheropezvum. 

In the Memoirs of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences for 
1S-19, Deane had again a paper on fossil footprints of the Connecticut 
Valley, which he regarded as in part those of birds and in part those 
of reptiles. These were described and figured, but no attempt at 
classification was made. 

In 1858 Hitchcock published his Ichnology of New England, a 
quarto volume of some 200 pages, with 60 plates of footprints and a 
map of the Connecticut Valley, showing the distribution of the Tri- 
assic sandstone with its included tracks, together with a section across 
the valley at Springfield. This work is of importance, not merely 
on account of the detailed description of the tracks, but also as sum- 
ming up the knowledge of the subject and the prevailing opinion 
regarding the origin and age of the sandstone itself. The sandstone, 
it should be stated, had been regarded by many geologists as owing 
its present dip to its having been deposited upon a sloping floor. 
To this view Hitchcock now took exception and could find no way of 
escaping from the opinion that it had been upheaved since its deposi- 
tion. The age of the sandstone he considered to be undoubtedly 
Jurassic. He discussed in great detail the character of the tracks, 
and announced some thirty characteristics which he regarded as based 
on the principles of comparative anatomy and zoology, and which he 
thought afforded him reliable grounds from which to judge of the 
nature of an animal from its tracks. He felt that he could now decide 
with a good degree of confidence, first, whether the animal making 
the track was vertebral or invertebral; second, whether a biped, 
quadruped, or multiped; third, to which of the four great classes of 
vertebrates it belonged and, with less certainty, to what order, genus, 
or species the animal might be referred. It was in this work that he 
first proposed the term Lithichnozoa (the stony-track animals), to 
embrace the animals whose characters he described from their tracks. 
The classification adopted divided the animals into ten groups: First, 
marsupialoid animals; second, pachydactylous, or thick-toed birds; 
third, leptodactylous, or narrow-toed birds; fourth, ornithoid lizards 
or batrachians; fifth, lizards; sixth, hatrachians; seventh, chelonians; 
eighth, fishes; ninth, crustaceans, myriapods, and insects; and tenth, 
amiclidanx. 

It will be noted that the Brontozoum was still included under the 
group of pachydactylous or thick-toed birds. 

In 1863 we find Hitchcock again returning to the subject in a brief 
paper in the American Journal of Science for that year, in which he 
announced that, though having been compelled to give up ten or a 
dozen of his old species of footmarks, he had described over thirty 
new ones. Further, finding that an error had been made as to the 



032 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



number of phalanges in the trucks of some of the animals classed 
as Lithichnozoa, he confessed to a doubt if the animals heretofore 
grouped under this name should be classed as birds; and. as a general 
conclusion, announced that in fossil footmarks birds could not be dis- 
tinguished from quadrupeds by the number of phalanges. In this 
same paper he announced the finding of tracks which were accom- 
panied by certain markings which were evidently made by the tail of 
the animal, such being particularly characteristic of his Anisopus 
gracilis, an animal the quadrupedal nature of which had already been 
recognized. The presence of such tail-like markings in the case of 
the Anomcepus lead him into a somewhat lengthy discussion as to the 
affinities of this animal, whether bird or reptile, though he was evi- 
dently inclined to regard it as most nearly related to a lower order of 

birds like the Archse- 
opteryx. In support of 
this, he appended a let- 
ter from Professor 
Dana, in which he re- 
ferred to the general- 
ized characters of the 
early birds. 

Here the matter 
would appear to have 
rested until Mr. Ros- 
well Field, a farmer of 
Greenfield, Massachu- 
setts, on whose prop- 
ert} r the first slabs were 
found, for the first 
time in print voiced 
his own opinions. In 
the American Journal of Science, XXIX, 1860, he gave briefly and 
modestly the results of his experience in collecting and observing, 
and announced it as his opinion that the vertebral tracks should all be 
classed as reptilian. That the animals that made them usually walked 
on two feet he admitted, but contended that they could as well have 
walked on four had they chosen. In proof of this he added: 

We find tracks as perfect as if made in plaster or wax winch, to all appearances, 
as to the number of toes and the phalangeal or lateral expansions in the toes, agree 
perfectly well with those of living birds, and still we know, by the impressions made 
by their forward feet, that these fossil tracks were made by quadrupeds. 

In still other cases he noted traces of the tails tracking in the mud. 
Enumerating some of the cases in which the so-called bird tracks — as, 
for instance, the Otosoum, had been proven to be reptilian- he added 
that this he verily believed is the place for them all. And in this he

was right, but it was not until 1893 that the actual bones of one of the 
reptiles were found in a sufficiently good state of preservation to allow 
Prof. O. C. Marsh to make the restoration shown in fig. 123. This 
particular form was about six feet in height, when standing, as in the 
figure. '"One of the most slender and delicate dinosaurs yet dis- 
covered, being only surpassed in this respect by some of the smaller, 
bird-like forms of the Jurassic." The creature is shown in the figure 
in the position it is thought to have habitually assumed. On a firm 
but moist beach only three-toed impressions would have been left by 
the hind feet and the tail would have been kept free from the ground. 
On a soft muddy shore the claw of the fifth digit would have also left 
its mark, and perhaps the tail would have dragged. When, perhaps 
momentarily, he rested on his fore feet, tracks of a quite dissimilar 
nature would have resulted, such as at first were assumed to be those 
of an animal of another species. 

And so the matter rests. 

Dr. James Deane was born at Coleraine, .Massachusetts. February 
21, 1801, and became by profession a physician, practicing at Green- 
field, in the same State. Eminently successful in his practice, he 
nevertheless found time for stud}' and work in other 
Delne h ° f Doctor Hues. u Not a moment was lost that he could spare 
from the great labors of his profession. Late into 
the night was his lamp seen glittering from his -casement * * * 
while he was copying, with his masterly touch, these relics of an 
ancient era" (Bowditch). He is described as a man of few words, 
though of a genial and social character; of a tall and commanding- 
form, and a well knit, compact frame: a man whose very walk con- 
veyed an idea of strength.

Director of the Geological Survey of Canada. 



CHAPTER IX. 




THE EOZOON QUESTION. 

In his work on the geology of Canada, 1863, Logan described some- 
what briefly certain forms strongly resembling fossils which were dis- 
covered some three years earlier in the Laurentian rocks belonging to 
the Grand Calumet series of Canada. 

The specimens represented parallel or concentric layers of crystal- 
line pyroxene, the interstices of which were filled with crystalline 
carbonate of lime, resembling somewhat the structure of the fossil 
Stromatopora rugosa found in the Bird's-eye and Black River lime- 
stone. (See fig. 124.) Logan realized the 
fact that organic remains found entombed 
in these limestones would, if they retained 
their calcareous nature, be almost certainly 
obliterated by crystallization, and it would 
only be through the replacement of the origi- 
nal lime carbonate by some different mineral 
substance that there would be an} r chance of 
the forms being preserved. Nevertheless, 
their resemblance to fossil remains was so 
great that, had the specimens been obtained 
from the altered rocks of the Lower Silu- 
rian series instead of the Laurentian, he 
thought there would have been little hesi- 
tancy in pronouncing them to be true fossils. 

In the Quarterly Journal of the Geolog- 
ical Society of London for 1865 Logan 
returned to the subject, bringing much new 
evidence to bear. He described the oldest 
rocks in North America as those composing 

the Laurentide Mountains of Canada and the Adirondacks of New 
York, dividing them into the Lower and Upper Laurentian series, the 
united thickness of which was estimated to probably exceed 30,000 
feet, and this overlaid by a third group (the Huronian), which had 
been estimated to be some ' 18,000 feet in thickness. In both the 
Upper and Lower Laurentian series he found zones of limestone 
which had sufficient volume to constitute an independent formation. 

While studying these rocks he had naturally fallen to speculating 
upon the possible occurrence of life during the period in which they

were being laid down, and his mind was doubtless in a mood to readily 
accept any promising discoveries. He recognized the fact that the 
mere apparent absence of fossils from the crystalline limestone did not 
seem to otter any proof in negation, since such might have been oblit- 
erated by metamorphic action, and he referred to the arguments of 
T. Sterry Hunt in favor of the possible organic origin of the beds of 
iron ore and metallic sulphurets in the older rocks. When, therefore, 
these imitative forms were brought to his attention, he candidly 
acknowledged himself as being disposed to look upon them as fossils. 

and, indeed, he exhibited 
them as such at the meeting 
of the American Association 
for the Advancement of Sci- 
ence at Springfield in 1859. 

Subsequently" thin sec- 
tions prepared from these 
were referred to Dr. J. W. 
Dawson, of Montreal, who 
was regarded as the most 
practiced observer with the 
microscope. To Doctor Daw- 
son, then, may be given a 
large share of whatever credit 
is due for the recognition of 
the supposed animal nature 
of this much disputed body. 
The specimens first exam- 
ined by Dawson were from 
the base of the so-called Gren- 
ville limestone, belonging to 
the highest zones of the 
Laurent ian, the mass of the 
rock being composed of great 
and small irregular aggre- 
gates of white crystalline 
pyroxene, interspersed with a multitude of small spaces, consisting 
mainly of carbonate of lime, many of which showed minute structures 
similar to that of the supposed fossil. The general character of the 
rock he thought conveyed the impression that it was a great fora- 
miniferal reef in which the pyroxenic masses represented a more 
ancient portion, which, having died, had become much broken up 
and worn into cavities and deep recesses, affording a seat for a new 
growth of foraminifera, represented by the calcareous and serpentin-

ous part. This in turn became again broken, leaving in some places 
uninjured portions of the general form. 

The main difference between this foraminiferal reef and more recent 
coral reefs, he thought to be, that, while with the latter there arc 
usually associated many shells and other organic remains, in the more 
ancient one the only remains yet found were those of the animal which 
built the reef. 

Dawson attacked the problem from the zoologist's standpoint. To 
properly understand his position and also that of those who combated 
his arguments, it must be remembered that the science of micro- 
petrography was then in its infancy; in fact the possibilities of meta- 
somatosis or alteration by indefinite substitution and replacement were 
only beginning to be realized by even the most advanced of mineralo- 
gists and geologists. Hence it was possible for two men, attacking 
the same problem from opposite 
standpoints — the one as a chemist 
and physicist and the other as a 
zoologist — to arrive at conclu- 
sions diametrically opposed to 
each other. 

The specimens examined, as 
already indicated, were masses 
often several inches in diameter, 
presenting to the naked eye al- 
ternate lamina? of serpentine, or 
pyroxene, and carbonate of lime, 
their general aspect reminding 
one, as already noted, of the Silu- 
rian Hydroids of the genus Stro- 
matopora (see tig. 124:). Under 
the microscope Dawson found 
the lamina 1 of serpentine and p} T roxene to present no organic structure, 
the pyroxene being highly ciystalline. The laminae of carbonate of 
lime, on the other hand, he thought retained distinct traces of struc- 
ture which could be considered only as organic, constituting parallel 
or concentric partitions of variable thickness inclosing flattened spaces 
or chambers, frequently crossed by transverse plates or septa. The 
lamina' themselves were frequently excavated on their sides into 
rounded pits, and in some places traversed 1>3 T canals and penetrated 
by numerous minute tubuli, a structure which can be best understood 
by a reference to fig. 126. 

According to the conclusions of Dawson, the calcareous portion rep- 
resented the portion of the original shell, the serpentinous matter, on 
the other hand, being material infiltrated into the cavities which had 
been occupied by sarcode during the life of the animal. He referred

the supposed organism to the group of Rhyzopods of the order of 
foraminifera, and conceived that during life they were sessile by a 
broad base and "grew by the addition of successive layers of cham- 
bers separated by calcareous lamina? but communicating with each 
other b} r canals or septal orifices sparsely and irregularly distributed." 
He imagined, further, that the organisms grew in groups which ulti- 
mately coalesced and formed large masses penetrated Ity deep, irregu- 
lar canals and that they continued to grow at the surface while the 
lower parts became dead and filled up with the infiltrated matter or 
sediment, assuming the aspect of a coral reef. 

On account of their geological position, he proposed to designate 
the animals b} r the name of Eozoon, and these particular ones by the 
specific name of canadense, and in his annual address before the 
Natural History Society of Canada for that year, referred to the dis-

covery as "one of the brightest gems in the scientific crown of the 
Geological Survey of Canada." 

The paper by Dawson was immediately followed by one bj T the well- 
known microscopist, W. B. Carpenter, whose conclusions were in 
every way confirmatory of those of Dawson. To quote his own words: 

That the Eozoon finds its proper place in the foraminiferal series, I conceive to 
be conclusively proved by its accordance with the great types of that series in all the 
essential characters of organization, namely, the structure of the shell forming the 
proper wall of the chambers, in which it agrees precisely with Nummulina and its 
allies; the presence of an intermediate skeleton and an elaborate canal system, the 
disposition of which reminds us most of Calcarina; a mode of communication of the 
chambers when they are most completely separated, which has its exact parallel in 
Oyclocypeus; and an ordinary want of completeness of separation between the cham- 
bers, corresponding with that which is characteristic of Carpentaria. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY THE EOZOON QUESTION. 



639 



The chemical and mineralogical side of the problem was taken up 
b}^ T. Sterry Hunt, who found that the silicate portion, i. e., the 
material filling the chambers, was composed of serpentine or pyroxene 
in some of its forms. 

It is not surprising that the finding of supposed fossil remains in 
rocks so old as those of the Laurentian should have excited the widest 
attention, and it would have been strange indeed had such conclusions 
been allowed to go unchallenged. In 1866 a there was read before the 
same society a detailed account of the investigations made by Profs. 
William King and T. H. Rowney, of Queen's University in Ireland. 
These gentlemen, although claiming to have had no misgivings at the 
commencement of their investigations as to 

the Eozoonal origin of the material, never- / ; I '-, '< ..' J {'/ > 

theless attacked the problem from the phys- 
ical and chemical rather than the biological 
standpoint. The}' examined in great detail 
all of the structures described by Dawson, 
though not having access to all his materials. 
Their conclusions were to the effect that (1) 
the so-called chamber casts or granules of 
serpentine were more or less simulated by 
minerals like chondrodite, coccolite, pargas- 
ite,etc. ; (2) that the i% intermediate skeleton'' 
was closely represented both in chemical 
composition and other conditions by the 
matrix of these minerals; (3) that the proper 
wall of Dawson was structurally identical 
with an asbestic-form la} T er which w T as fre- 
quently found investing the grains of chon- 
drodite, and that instead of belonging to the 
skeleton it was altogether independent of 
that part and formed an integral portion of 
the serpentine constituting a chamber cast; 
(4) that the canal system was analogous to 

the embedded crystallizations of native silver and other similarly con- 
ditioned minerals; and (5) that the type examples of casts of stolon 
passages were isolated crystals apparently of pyrosclerite. From these 
considerations and the perhaps even more important one that the 
Eozoonal structure was found only in metamorphic rocks and never in 
unaltered sedimentary deposits, they concluded that every one of the 
specialties which had been diagnosed for the Eozoon <■</,<,/</, ns< was of 
purely crystalline origin. 

Such conclusions naturally brought forth prompt rejoinders from 
Carpenter and others, the controversy becoming in some cases per-

sonal and often not particularly creditable to those most interested. 
Thus Carpenter accused Rowney of never having seen any transparent 
sections of Eozoon thin enough to give a good view of its tubuliferous 
layer until he himself had shown it to him; and, further than that, that 
he had no practical knowledge of the structure of nummuline shells at 
best. His paper in reply to the statements of Rowney concluded with 
the remark that he had recently had his attention called to an occur- 
rence of Eozoon, which was preserved simply in carbonate of lime 
without any serpentine or other foreign mineral, and showing the 
canal system ver} 7 perfectly. This he felt was a conclusive answer to 
King and Rowney's objection No. 3, to the effect that the canal system 
of Eozoon was no other than crystallization of metaxite, an allomor- 
phic variety of serpentine. 

In this same year Ferdinand von Hochstetter found in the crystal- 
line Azoic limestone of Krumman, Bavaria, structures which, when 
examined by Carpenter, were pronounced by him to be unmistakably 
those of Eozoon. 

The forms thus far found were limited to the Laurentian rocks, and 
were regarded by both Logan and Dawson as important " horizon 
markers, 11 i. e., as affording presumptive evidence in favor of the Lau- 
rentian age of all rocks in which they might occur. The announce- 
ment by C. W. Gi'imbel of finding Eozoonal structures in the Hercynian 
gneisses of Bavaria, regarded by him as of Huronian or Cambrian age, 
was, therefore, both disconcerting and encouraging to the Eozoonists. 
Gi'imbel himself adopted enthusiastically the conclusions of Carpenter 
and Dawson as to the organic nature of the forms. " This discovery," 
he wrote, "at once overturns the notions hitherto commonly enter- 
tained with regard to the origin of the stratified primary limestones. 
In this discovery we hail with joy the dawn of a new epoch." 

In 1867 Sir William Logan again brought the matter to the atten- 
tion of the Geological Society of London, submitting a specimen of 
Eozoon obtained in the township of Tudor, Hastings County, Canada, 
in which the serpentine minerals were quite lacking, it being, in fact, 
the specimen above referred to by Carpenter. This was examined 
and described by Dawson, who thought to be able to detect all the 
essential characteristics of the true Eozoon. In presenting his descrip- 
tion of this new find, Dawson took occasion once more to challenge the 
work of Messrs. King and Rowney, and accused them of making the 
fundamental error of defective observation in failure to distinguish 
between organic and crystalline forms, an accusation which he sub- 
stantiated (?) by a long argument not necessary to reproduce here. 

From this time on, literature on both sides of the Atlantic contains 
many references and matter more or less relevant to the discussion. 
By many of the best informed the organic nature of the fossil was con- 
sidered to be an open question, and but few American geologists, so 
far as I am aware, ever openly advocated it. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY THE EOZOON QUESTION. 641 

In 1871 Messrs. King and Rowney read before the Royal Irish Acad- 
emy a paper on the geological age and structure of the serpentine 
marble of Skye, in which reference was made to structures closely 
simulating those of the Eozoon, the rock in this case being of Liassic 
age, and the imitative forms being the result of structural and chemical 
changes to which such siliceous minerals as malacolite and other 
varieties of lime magnesian pyroxenes were characteristically liable. 

This paper was followed the same year by another on the mineral 
origin of the so-called Eozoon <-aii<i<J< n*< . which passed in review all of 
the accumulated evidence both for and against, reiterating and empha- 
sizing many of the statements made in previous papers. The} r held 
that the so-called intermediate skeleton and the chamber casts of the 
Eozoon were completely paralleled in various crystalline rocks con- 
taining pyroxene, the chamber casts being, in fact, composed occa- 
sionally of loganite and malacolite besides serpentine, a fact which, 
instead of favoring the organic origin, as claimed, was to be held as 
proof of their having been produced by mineral agencies. 

With reference to Giimbel's observations regarding the rounded 
cylindrical or tuberculated grains of coccolite and pargasite which he 
found in various crystalline marbles and supposed to be chamber casts, 
they claimed to have found upon such grains crystalline planes, angles, 
and edges, " a fact clearly proving that they were originally simple or 
compound crystals that have undergone external decretion by chemical 
or solvent action." 

The so-called nummulitic layer they contended had originated 
directly from closely packed fibrous or asbestif orm serpentine, and that 
it occurred in cracks or fissures in both the Canadian and Connemara 
(Ireland) ophite. The fact that the two superposed asbestiform layers 
forming the upper and under proper wall and their component aciculi 
often passed continuously and without interruption from one chamber 
cast to another, they argued was totally incompatible with the idea of 
this nummuline layer having resulted from pseudopodial tubulation. 
The canal system they found to be composed of serpentine or malaco- 
lite, and to be completely paralleled by crystalline configurations in 
the coccolite marble of Aker in Sweden, and in the crevices of a crystal 
of spinel embedded in a calcite matrix from Amity, New York. 

Finally, they argued that the occurrence of the Eozoon solely in 
crystalline or metamorphosed rocks, and never in ordinary unaltered 
deposits, must be assumed as completely demonstrating their purely 
mineral origin. The paper was aggressively argumentative from the 
start and contains a very scathing review of Dawson's work, further 
expressing a willingness to renounce the controversj 7 altogether, 
"fully believing that Doctor Dawson can employ his time more use- 
fully on other subjects than that of Eozoon."

642 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

The evidence, however, was not altogether one way, Max Schultze, 
after an examination of a specimen transmitted him by Dawson, 
announcing' that "there can be no serious doubt as to the forami- 
niferal nature of Eozoon canadense." Further evidence against the 
organic nature of the Eozoon was, however, furnished hy Mr. H. A. 
Carter in 3 874, in a letter to Professor King, and published in the 
Annals and Magazine of Natural History of that year. After a some- 
what elaborate comparison of the structure of Eozoon with that of 
known foraminifera, he wrote: 

But in vain do we seek in the so-called Eozoon canadense for an unvarying perpen- 
dicular tubuli, the sine qua non of foraminiferal structure. * * * In short, in vain 
do we look for the casts of true foraminiferous chambers at all in the grains of serpen- 
tine. They, for the most part, are not subglobular hut subprismatic. With such 
deficiencies I am at a loss to conceive how the so-called Eozoon canadense can be 
identified with foraminiferous structure except by the wildest conjecture. 

To the conclusions of Carter, Carpenter took violent exception and 
accused that gentleman of not having read anything that had been 
written bearing upon the other side of the question; of having no 
comprehensive knowledge of foraminiferal structure, and of having 
seen only those samples of Eozoon submitted by Professor King; and 
hence his imputation to the effect that the organic nature of the 
Eozoon had no other basis than iw the wildest conjecture " was to be 
regarded "simply as specimens of a new method of language which 
might be termed Carterese." He then went over once more certain 
disputed points and concluded by saying: 

An experience of thirty-five years * * * has given me, I venture to think, 
some special aptitude for recognizing organic structure when I see it; and I never 
saw, in any fossil whatever, more distinct evidences of organic structure than are to 
be seen in these finer ramifications of the canal system of Eozoon." 

Perhaps the most important paper on the subject after those men- 
tioned was that of Dr. (Jail Moebius, of Kiel, in 1879. Moebius, it 
should be noted, was a zoologist and microseopist. He claimed to 
have been first led to the study of the Eozoon through observations of 
the structure of a rhyzopod found by him in 1874 on the coral reefs 
near Mauritius. Sections of these growths so closely resembled the 
representations of Eozoon sections published that he resolved to 
make a careful investigation of the latter for purposes of comparison 
with his Carpentaria ni]>/ii<l<><lf ml 'r<>n and other foraminifera. With 
this object in view, he investigated upward of 90 Eozoon sections, 
which were placed at his disposal through the kindness of Doctor 
Carpenter, and many of which original ly belonged to Professor 
Dawson. 

" " For treweley there is noon of us all, 
If any wight wol claw us on the galle, 
That we nyl kike." 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY THE EOZOON QUESTION. t)4.'-> 

The result of Moebius's work was not at all, presumably, what Car- 
penter was led to expect or Dawson to hope. He wrote: 

My task. was to examine the Eozoon from a biological point of view. I com- 
menced it with the expectation that I should succeed in establishing its organic 
origin beyond all doubt, but facts led me to the contrary. When I saw first the 
beautiful stem systems in Professor Carpenter's sections, I became at once a partisan 
of the view of Professor Dawson and Professor Carpenter, but the more good sec- 
tions and isolated stems I examined the mure doubtful became to my mind the 
organic origin of Eozoon, until at last the most magnificent canal systems taken alto- 
gether and closely compared with foraminiferal sections preached to me nothing but 
the inorganic character of Eozoon over and over again. 

Dawson thereupon became particularly indignant, and characterized 
Moebius's work as furnishing "only another illustration of partial and 
imperfect investigation, quite unreliable as a verdict on the question 
in hand." He claimed that Moebius should have studied the fossil in 
situ and in its various stages of preservation; that he confounded the 
"proper wall' 1 with the chrysotile veins traversing many of the speci- 
mens; and that, further, in his criticisms he regarded each structure 
separately, and did not ""consider their cumulative force when taken 
together." This cumulative force he presented as follows: 

1. it (i. e., Eozoon) occurs in certain layers of widely distributed limestones, evi- 
dently <>f aqueous origin, and on other grounds presumably organic. 

2. Its general form, lamination, and chambers resemble those (if the Silurian 
Stromatopora and its allies, and of such modern sessile foraminifera as Carpentaria 
and Polytrema. 

3. It shows under the microscope a tubulated proper wall similar to that of the 
numnmlites, though of even finer texture. 

4. It shows also in the thicker layers a secondary or supplemental skeleton with 
canals. 

5. These forms appear more or less perfectly in specimens mineralized with very 
different substances. , 

6. The structures of Eozoon are of such generalized character as might be expected 
in a very early Protozoan. 

7. It has been found in various parts of the world under very similar forms, and 
in beds approximately of the same geological horizon. 

8. It may be added, though perhaps not as an argument, that the discovery of 
Eozoon affords a rational mode of explaining the immense development of lime- 
stones in the Laurentian age; and on the other hand that the various attempts which 
have been made to account for the structures of Eozoon on other hypotheses than 
that of organic origin have not been satisfactory to chemists or mineralogists, as 
Doctor Hunt has very well shown. 

Singularly enough, although found on the Western Continent, 
active work regarding the nature of the Eozoon was confined largely 
to the Canadians and English, with an occasional European collabora- 
tor, workers in the United States taking little part in the dispute so 
far as indicated by literature, although watching the contest with 
interest and becoming more or less partisans, according to the extent 
of their own observations or the character of the evidence offered. 
In 1ST1 Messrs. Burbank and Perry made a study of the Eozoonal

limestone occurring at Chelmsford, Bolton, and Boxboro, in Massa- 
chusetts, and arrived at the conclusion that the limestones were not 
themselves of a sedimentary, but a vein-like character, and that con- 
sequently the Eozoon itself, as there occurring - , must be of mineral 
and not organic origin. 

Meantime the study of micro-petrography was steadily advancing, 
and it was noticeable that none of the workers along these newly 
developed lines of research were disposed to regard the Eozoon as of 
other than inorganic origin. Prof. T. G. Bonney, of St. John's Col- 
lege, Cambridge, England, who in 1876 announced his opposition to 
the theory of organic origin, in 1884 visited one of the most noted of 
the Canadian localities in company with Doctor Dawson, and published 
the results of his observations in the Geological Magazine for 1895, 
but contented himself with describing the mode of occurrence and 
structure of the mass without committing himself further as to its

origin. From this paper was taken the accompanying figure. His 
conclusions so far as given were to the effect that the Eozoon often 
occurs in close relation, on the one hand, with a fundamental mass of 
almost pure pyroxene (or serpentine resulting from its alteration); or, 
on the other hand, with a fairly large mass of crystalline limestone 
containing more or less numerous grains of pyroxene or serpentine. 
He found nothing to lead him to think the P^ozooiial specimens were 
blocks of foreign material metamorphosed by becoming included in 
either a volcanic or plutonic mass as has been suggested (see p. 645). 
The structure, to his mind, ottered a choice between two interpreta- 
tions only. It "is either a record of an organism or a very peculiar 
and exceptional condition of a pyroxene marble of Laurentian age." 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY THE EOZOON QUESTION. 645 

The fact that the lime-magnesian pyroxenes, through a process of 
chemical metamorphism, passed over into serpentine, and that many 
of the supposed sarcode chambers were tilled with granules of this 
material in all stages of this alteration was from time to time noted 
by Messrs. King and Kowne} T , Julien, Williams, Wadsworth, Merrill, 
and others. The evidence thus presented was, however, wholly with- 
out effect on Messrs. Carpenter and Dawson, who to the very last 
remained true to their convictions, and as late as 1895 Dawson reviewed 
the subject with seeming thoroughness and announced his original 
opinion as unchanged. 

It remained, however, for J. W. Gregory and H. J. Johnston-La vis, 
to give the deathblow to the theory as late as 1891 and 181)4. Gregory, 
from an exhaustive study of Dawson's original specimen of the so-called 
Tudor Eozoon, arrived at the conclusion that the same was wholly of 
an inorganic nature. After a careful examination of all the slides and 
figures, he wrote: 

I must confess myself absolutely unable to recognize in the specimen any trace of 
the proper wall, canals, or stolon passages which are claimed to occur in Eozoon. 

The case against the organic nature of the specimen did not, how- 
ever, rest upon negative evidence alone. The rock was intensely 
cleaved and crumpled. The twin laminae in the planes of crystalline 
cleavage in the calcite bands were, however, not bent. Further than 
this, the bedding plane could be traced directly across the specimen, 
traversing the limestone in the supposed body cavities. These facts 
would seemingly prove conclusively that the supposed organic forms 
were not original, but wholly secondary and due to metamorphism. 

Johnston-Lavis's later work was perhaps even more decisive, since 
he showed that structures in every way similar could be produced by 
the action of heat upon limestone. His conclusions were based upon 
an examination of microscopic slides from blocks of limestone in the 
volcanic tuffs of Monte Somma. To appreciate his evidence it must 
be remembered that these blocks are ejected from the volcano and are 
found embedded in a tuff consisting largely of pumiceous lava. They 
occur as irregular, angular, or subangular masses ranging to more 
than a cubic meter, though commonly less than a quarter of that size. 
They have been acted upon by the heat and vapors of the volcano and 
more or less completely metamorphosed, giving rise to various silicate 
minerals, including pyroxene, olivine,, epidote, mica, etc. The struc- 
ture of these altered limestones is entirely different from that of the 
unaltered material, and corresponds in all details with those of the 
original Canadian specimens, in many cases, on account of their fresh- 
ness, exhibiting some of the pseudo-organic structure details — such as 
stolon passages — in far greater perfection than does the true so-called 
Eozoon. 



646 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

It has been noted that American workers took comparatively little 
part in active research, though it does not necessarily follow that 
examinations of the problematic bodies were not made sufficient to 
enable them to hold opinions of their own. It is interesting-, there- 
fore, to note that few of the active workers accepted unhesitatingly 
the organic theory, and many of them rejected it entirely. The con- 
sensus of opinion to-day is so decidedly against the organic nature of 
the body that it may be considered as practically settled, although 
Dana, in the latest issue of his Manual, includes a copy of one of 
Dawson's original figures, and sums up the evidence pro and con 
without prejudice. 

There is apparently no doubt but that this simulative form is due 
merely to a process of chemical metamorphism, a process of indefinite 
substitution and replacement, technically metasomatosis, acting upon 
rocks which are granular aggregates of lime-magnesian pyroxenes, 
with more or less calcareous matter, the serpentine being, in all cases, 
secondary. Such an origin is suggested at once, even to the uniniti- 
ated, by reference to figures like that of Bonney's, on page 644. 
Similar structures have, moreover, been noted by various observers 
in rocks which were unmistakably of igneous origin. 

Specialization is, undoubtedly, essential to the rapid advancement of 
knowledge, but there is danger of specialization being carried too far- 
danger that the individual, through insufficient breadth of training or 
through too close application to his own particular hobby, may ignore 
the work of his neighbor along other lines, and perhaps in time 
become so immune as to be unable to appreciate that work, even when 
its details are laid before him. 

In the review of the Eozoon question, much must be allowed for the 
growth of science — the gradual increase in knowledge regarding both 
mineral structure and mineral alteration. Still, one who peruses these 
papers can but feel that had Messrs. Dawson and Carpenter had a little 
more knowledge of mineralogy they would have been less dogmatic 
in their assertions, and it is possible that had Messrs. King and Row- 
ney had more knowledge of foraminiferal structure they might have 
been less harsh in their criticisms.

(Then first the creature found a tongue,)

Prefers your eyesight to his own.' " 



CHAPTER X. 

THE LARAMIE QUESTION. 

It will be recalled that Hayden, in his annual report for 1872, 
referred to the fact that (luring- his explorations of the Tertiary forma- 
tions along- the upper Missouri River in 1854-55 he made large collec- 
tions of shells and plants, many of which were quite new to science. 
During the succeeding years up to the autumn of 1860 these explorations 
were extended and large additions made to the collections, which were 
described from time to time in the current literature. 

The shells were all of extinct species of fresh-water origin and, while 
they did not appear to be positively characteristic of any age, were 
regarded by Meek as more nearly resembling Tertiary types than 
any other. The fossil plants were mostly of extinct species and 
regarded by Newberry as also of Tertiary age, probably Miocene. 

From evidence of this kind, accumulated during the various expe- 
ditions, Hayden had announced the conviction that these Lignitic 
strata, as he called them, which had been found to occupy such vast 
areas in the upper Missouri Valley — extending far southward, with 
very little interruption, to New Mexico, and westward into the interior 
of the continent were probably all portions of one great group, inter- 
rupted here and there by mountain chains or concealed by more modern 
deposits, and from the identity of their fossil flora, all of Tertiary age. 

He then went on to state that his studies of the lower coal beds at 
Rear River City, Wyoming, and Coalville, Utah, in 1868, had con- 
vinced him that these particular beds were of Cretaceous age, but 
admitting this, he felt, would be to admit the Cretaceous age of all 
the coal beds of the Northwest, and in so doing to ignore the evidence 
of the fossil flora altogether. The facts then at hand, he thought, 
seemed rather to point to the conclusion that the deposition of all the 
Lignitic strata began during the latter portion of the Cretaceous 
period and continued on into Tertiary time without any marked physi- 
cal break, so that many of the Cretaceous types, especially of the 
vertebrata, may have lingered on through the transition period, even 
into the Tertiary epoch. Inasmuch as this statement contains the first 
satisfactory recognition of the full importance of what later became 
known as the Laramie question, and inasmuch, further, as the dis- 

647 



648 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

cussion brought out man} 7 interesting facts and opinions relative to 
the proportional value of the various kinds of fossil remains as horizon 
markers, the subject may be dwelt upon in some detail. 

It is well to anticipate, however, in order to more readily understand 
what is to follow, that Hayden made a fundamental error in thus 
assuming an identity of age for all the lignite strata. Had he realized 
the fact, afterwards abundantly proven, that essentially similar condi- 
tions existed at various periods in localities not widely remote from 
one another, and which were productive of very similar results, the 
so-called " Laramie question," as it is known to-day, would never have 
arisen. The apparently conflicting character of the fossil remains of 
plants and animals was, nevertheless, extremely confusing, and some 
discussion and verbal warfare during the gradual accumulation of the 
necessary data for the final settlement of the problem was bound to 
arise. . It will be well to note, further, that the localities from whence 
was derived the major portion of the evidence brought to bear 
were: Fort Union, Nebraska; the Judith River, on the upper Missouri, 
Montana; Coalville, Utah; and Bear River and Bitter Creek, in 
Wyoming. Incidentally, other localities in Colorado and New Mexico 
came in for discussion. 

During the season of 1872 Lesquereux, Meek, and Cope were assigned 
by Hayden to work in areas which seemed to afford the most promising 
opportunities for deciding the question as to the precise position of 
the beds in the geological scale. Their reports as rendered in the 
annual reports for 1872-73 were widely divergent and did little more 
than to emphasize the existing confusion. 

Lesquereux worked, of course, wholly from a paleobotanical stand- 
point. He explored the plant-bearing Cretaceous strata of the Dakota 
group and the valley of the Saline River, as well as the Smoky Hill 
Fork of the Kansas River and the Lignite formations of the Rocky 
Mountains from Trinidad to Cheyenne and along the Union Pacific 
Railroad to Evanston. He made extensive collections and studied the 
materials in great detail, comparing the forms found with those from 
sundry of the known geological horizons in Europe. The summary 
of his conclusions, as given in his own words, was to the effect 

That the great Lignitic group must be considered as a whole and well-characterized 
formation, limited at its base by the fucoidal sandstone, at its top by the conglom- 
erate beds; that independent from the Cretaceous under it and from the Miocene 
above it our Lignitic formations represent the American Eocene. 

Meek regarded the Coalville and Bear River beds as Cretaceous, 
but argued for the Bitter Creek beds that the entire absence among 
the invertebrate fossils yet found of Baculites, Scaphites, Ancyloceras, 
Ptychoceras, Ammonites, Gyrodes, Anchura, hwceramus^ and all of the 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY THE LARAMIE QUESTION. 649 

other long- list of genera characteristic of the Cretaceous certainly left 
its molluscan fauna with strong Tertiary facies. When, however, he 
came to consider these fossils in their specific relation he found that 
all, with possibly two or three exceptions, were new to science and 
quite different from those yet found either at Bear River or Coalville, 
or, indeed, elsewhere in any of the established horizons. He felt, 
therefore, that he could scarcely more than conjecture from their 
specific affinities to known forms what the probable age of the rocks 
might be in which they were found. He, however, called attention 
to the following facts relative to the age of the formation as found at 
Hitter Creek: 

First. That it was conformable to an extensive fresh-water Tertiary 
formation above, from which it did not differ materially in lithological 
characters except in its containing numerous beds of coal. 

Second. That it seemed also to be conformable to a somewhat 
differently composed group of strata below, apparently containing 
little, if any coal, and believed to be of Creta< eons age. 

Third. That it showed no essential difference of lithological char- 
acters from the Cretaceous coal-bearing rocks at Bear River and 
Coalville. 

Fourth. (Omitting references to Lesquereux's determinations) that 
all its animal remains thus far known were specifically different from 
any of those found in any other formation of this region, with possibly 
two or three exceptions. 

Fifth. That all its known invertebrate remains were mollusks, con- 
sisting of about thirteen species and varieties of marine, brackish, 
and fresh-water types, none of which belonged to genera peculiar to 
the Cretaceous or any older rocks, but all to such as are alike common 
to the Cretaceous, Tertiary, and present epochs, with possibly one 
exception. 

Sixth. That, on the other hand, two or three of its species belong- 
to sections or subgenera apparently characteristic of the Eocene- 
Tertiary of Europe, and even very closely allied to species of that age 
found in the Paris basin, while one species seemed to be conspecific 
with and two congeneric with forms found in brackish-water beds on 
the upper Missouri containing vertebrate remains most nearly allied 
to types hitherto deemed characteristic of the Cretaceous. 

Seventh. That one species of Anomia found in it is very similar to 
and perhaps identical with a Texas Cretaceous shell, while a Viviparus, 
found in one of the upper beds, is almost certainly identical with 
the V. trochiformis of the fresh-water Lignite formations of the 
upper Missouri, •( formation which has always been considered as 
Tertiary. 



650 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

He summed up his evidence as follows: It thus becomes manifest 
that the paleontological evidence bearing on the question of the age 
of this formation, so far as yet known, is of a very conflicting nature; 
though aside from the Dinosaur bones (found by him at Black Butte 
in 1*872) the organic remains favor the conclusion that it is Tertiary. 
The testimony of the plants, however, on this point, although they 
doubtless represent what would be in Europe considered as clearly a 
Tertiary flora, is weakened by the fact that we already know that 
there is in Nebraska, in clearly Cretaceous rocks, a flora that was 
referred by the highest European authority to the Miocene. 

In the report for 1<S73 (printed in 1874) Lesquereux returned once 
more to the subject and answered more or less satisfactorily various 
objections which had been made to his previous conclusions. He 
referred to the Eocene (Lower American Eocene) all the coal strata 
of the Raton Mountains; those of the Canyon City coal basin; those of 
Colorado Springs; those of the whole basin of central and north Col- 
orado extending from Platte River or from the Pinery divide to south 
of Che}'enne, including Golden, Marshall, Bowlder Valley, Sand 
Creek, etc.; and in Wyoming, the Black Butte, Hallville, and Rock 
Spring coal. He considered as American Upper Eocene or Lower 
Miocene the coal strata of Evanston, and from identity of the charac- 
ters of the flora, those 6 miles above Spring Canyon near Fort Ellis, 
those of the localh^ marked near Yellowstone Lake among basaltic 
rocks, and those of Troublesome Creek, Mount Brosse, and Elk Creek, 
Colorado. The coal from Bellingham Bay, in Washington, he would 
also refer to the same horizon. To the Middle Miocene he would 
refer the coal basin of Carbon and those of Medicine Bow, Point of 
Rocks, and Rock Creek; to the Upper Miocene, the coal of Elko 
Station, Nevada. 

Concerning the evidence of invertebrates regarding the Cretaceous 
age of these beds, he simply remarks: 

I regarded and still regard the presence of .some scattered fragments of Cretaceous 
shells as of little moment in comparison with the well-marked characters of the flora, 
characters which have been wholly established by a large number of specimens 
obtained from all the localities referred to the Lignitic. 

Cope, in his report for this same year, was inclined to agree with 
Hayden in thinking that the period of the deposition of the sediments 
of this Lignite or Fort Union group, as it was also called, was one of 
transition from marine to lacustrine conditions and added: 

It appears impossible, therefore, to draw the line satisfactorily without the aid of 
paleontology, but here, while evidence ot interruption is clear from the relations of 
the plants and vertebrate animals, it is not identical in the two cases, but discrepant. 

He then went on to discuss the evidence as given by the various 
workers, and referring to Lesquereux and Newberry's opinions, based 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY THE LARAMIE QUESTION. 651 

upon the flora, to the effect that the whole series of formations is of 
Tertiary age, summed up his results as follows: 

J regard the evidence derived from the mollusks in the lower beds and the verte- 
brates in the higher as equally conclusive that the beds are of Cretaceous age. There 
is, then, no alternative but to accept the results that a Tertiary flora was contempo- 
raneous with a Cretaceous fauna, establishing an uninterrupted succession of life 
across what is generally regarded as one of the greatest breaks in geological time. 

Practically the same conclusion was independently arrived at by 
Kingin his study of the Green River coal basin in connection with the 
surveys of the fortieth parallel." He wrote: 

We have, then, here the uppermost members of the Cretaceous series laid down in 
the period of oceanic sway and quite freely charged with fossil relics of marine life; 
then an uninterrupted passage of coinformable beds through the brackish period up 
until the whole Green River basin became a single sheet of fresh water. 

It will be seen then that the transitional character of the beds was 
very generally recognized, the main point in dispute from now on being 
that of their Upper Cretaceous or Lower Tertiary age. 

A. R. Marvine, in his report for this year (1ST:-)), also discussed the 
problem, but somewhat guardedly, since his opportunities for obser- 
vation had confessedly been somewhat limited. He wrote, after 
summarizing the opinions of others: 

It must be supposed, then, that either a Cretaceous fauna extended forward into 
the Eocene period and existed contemporaneously with an Eocene flora, or else 
that a flora wonderfully prophetic of Eocene times anticipated its age and flourished 
in the Cretaceous period to the exclusion of all Cretaceous plant forms. 

Again, and much more to the point, he wrote: 

Much of the confusion and discrepancy has, in my opinion, arisen from regarding 
different horizons as one and the same thing. It must be distinctly understood that 
tins group as it exists east of the mountains in Colorado is very different from, and 
must not be confounded with, the horizon in winch much of the Utah ami New 
Mexican lignite occurs, and which belongs undoubtedly to the Lower Cretaceous; 
and, further, that the extended explorations of llayden and others would seem to 
prove almost conclusively that the Colorado lignite group is the direct southern 
stratigraphical equivalent of the Fort Union group of the upper Missouri, which is 
considered generally to be no older than the Eocene, while Newberry asserts that it 
is Miocene. 

To Lesquereux's conclusions in the report for 1872, Newberry, in 
an article in the American Journal of Science, 1874, took exception, 
calling in question the accuracy of many of his statements, and affirm- 
ing that, to his "certain knowledge," a considerable portion of the 
flora he called Eocene was really Cretaceous and another portion 
Miocene. Further than that, having spent nearly two years in New 
Mexican explorations, he felt authorized to state that all the lignite 
beds yet known in New Mexico were unmistakably of Cretaceous age. 
While, through lack of acquaintance with the Colorado localities cited 

"The third volume, 1870. 



652 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

by Lesquereux, he would not venture to doubt the truth of his asser- 
tions regarding- the same, he nevertheless reminded him that: (1) The 
flora of the Colorado lignite beds had almost nothing in common with 
that of the European Eocene, in his judgment not a single species and 
scarcely any genera being common to both; (2) that the tuberculated 
fucoid (Halymenites), considered by Lesquereux as diagnostic of the 
Eocene, was really in New Mexico the most characteristic fossil of the 
Cretaceous; and (3) that, guided by their animal remains, Professors 
Marsh. Meek, Cope, and Stevenson had all regarded the Colorado 
lignites as Upper Cretaceous. 

Newberry further contended that in the plant beds which he had 
himself designated as Miocene the entire aspect of the flora was iden- 
tical with the Miocene of Europe, and contained a very considerable 
number of well-marked Miocene species, not one of which deserved to 
be called Eocene. The lignite plant beds of New Mexico, which he 
called Cretaceous but which Lesquereux referred to the Tertiary, 
were for the most part derived from the lower portions of our Creta- 
ceous scries, and were overlaid by many hundreds of feet of unques- 
tionable Cretaceous strata in which all the typical Cretaceous forms 
were represented. 

He further announced the principle that: 

In the absence of any distinctive or unmistakably Eocene plants, if the strata 
which contain them (the lignite deposits) shall be found to include vertebrates or 
molusks which have a decidedly Mesozoic aspect, we shall have to include them in 

the Cretaceous system. 

To Lesquereux's claim that the testimony of his 250 species of fossil 
plants far outweigh that of the Cretaceous mollusks, he rejoined that 
these plants were probably all distinct from European Cretaceous and 
Eocene species and had little or no bearing on the question in hand. 
He acknowledged it was not impossible that the physical condition of 
the continent may have been such that the Cretaceous age faded grad- 
ually into the Tertiary, and that consequently some forms of Creta- 
ceous life might be found interlocking with those of Tertiary age, but 
of this he demanded proof, and asserted that as yet none such had 
been found. 

J. J. Stevenson, meeting with these same beds in his work in con- 
nection with the Wheeler Survey (1874), pronounced in favor of their 
Upper Cretaceous age. As for the nodose fucoid Halymenites, he 
agreed with Newberry that it was not indicative of their Eocene age, 
since it was never found with any but a Cretaceous fauna. Neither 
was the evidence of the land plants acceptable to him, the materials 
being mostly single leaves and in a state of preservation showing that 
they had been blown from trees growing near streams or on the shore, 
where they were washed into the sea and became associated with at 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY THE LARAMIE QUESTION. 653 

least one fossil identified with the Cretaceous, and a few of which were 
identical with European species. 

It was more reasonable, he thought, to suppose that in the later 
portion of the Cretaceous period the climate in our northwestern 
region was like that of the European Eocene than to imagine that our 
Cretaceous fauna is useless for determination of horizon in the narrow 
.-trip east of the mountains in Colorado, while acknowledging it to be 
decisively of Cretaceous age in New Mexico, the rocks being the same, 
but the leaves being absent. 

To Newberry's criticisms Lesqucreux replied" that the Cretaceous 
age of the so-called halymenites sandstone had not yet been proven 
and could not be decided on mere affirmation; but that when Doctor 
Newberry had furnished sufficient proof or evidence on the geological 
age of the lignites of New Mexico he was prepared to accept Ms deci 
sion. The quoted opinions of Marsh. Cope, and Stevenson he claimed 
were based on insufficient evidence. All the repeated assertions of 
the finding of fossil shells and bones of Cretaceous age in the lignites 
of Colorado, when carefully sifted down, reduced themselves to the 
finding of a single badly -preserved specimen of Inoceramus. 

He asserted that the lignitic formation, having positively a pre- 
ponderance of land plants over marine animals, in other words, being 
composed wholly of detritus from the land or a land formation, as he 
styled it, the evidence presented by the fossil plants should outweigh 
in importance that of some Cretaceous animal remains, whose presence 
could be considered as of casual occurrence. Cope's conclusions, he 
argued, did not in the least interfere with his own, simply proving the 
noncoincidence of animal and vegetable types in certain formations, 
but if, he added: 

Tertiary and Cretaceous faunas are regarded as contemporaneous, even inhabiting 
the same repositories, we may more easily admit that a Cretaceous fauna and Ter- 
tiary flora have sometimes succeeded each other in alternating strata. 

Lesquereux further contended that the specimens on which Doctor 
Newberry had relied to substantiate the sum of the opinions he 
advanced had become mixed and had, in reality, come from different 
localities and represented different horizons. 

In his report for 1874 (letter of transmittal written in October, 
isTo) Hayden took up the matter once more, with particular reference 
to the results of investigations in Colorado. These he felt warranted 
him in drawing the following conclusions: 

First. That through the upper portion of the Fox Hill group (Cre- 
taceous) there are clear proofs of a radical physical change, usually 
with no break in the sequence of time. In this portion of the group 



"American Journal of Science, L874. 



654 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

are well-marked Cretaceous fossils of purely marine types and no 
others. 

Second. That above the Fox Hill group there are about 200 feet of 
barren beds, which might be regarded as beds of passage to the lignitic 
group and which more properly belong with the Fox Hill group below. 
In this group of transition beds all trace of the abundant invertebrate 
life of the great Cretaceous series below has disappeared. 

Third, in almost all cases he found, at the base of the true Lignitic 
group, a bed of sandstone in which the first deciduous leaves peculiar 
to the group occur. No purely marine mollusks pass above this hori- 
zon. Estuary or brackish- water shells are found in many localities in 
great abundance, but these soon disappear and are succeeded farther 
north by fossils of purely fresh-water origin. He added: 

Whatever view we may take in regard to the age of the Lignitic group, we may 
certainly claim that it forms one of the time boundaries in the geological history of 
our western continent. It may matter little whether we call it tipper Cretaceous or 
Lower Eocene, so far as the physical result is concerned. We know that it plays an 
important and, to a certain extent, an independent part in the physical history of 
the growth of the continent. Even the vertebrate paleontologists, who pronounce 
with great positiveness the Cretaceous age of the Lignite group, do not claim that a 
single species of vertebrate animals passes above the horizon I have defined from the 
well-marked Cretaceous group below. 

Peale, in his report for that .year, threw a ray of light upon the sub- 
ject by suggesting that the reason of the difference of opinion as to the 
age of the disputed beds might be the existence of two sets of lignite- 
bearing beds close together, one belonging to the horizon of the Fox 
Hill beds of the Cretaceous, or possibly a little above it, and the other 
belonging to the horizon of the Fort Union group (Lower Eocene). 
He incidentally called up the question relative to the value of different 
types of fossils as criteria in determining the precise geological horizon. 

He summed up his own conclusions as follows: 

First. The lignite-bearing beds east of the mountains in Colorado are the equiva- 
lent of the Fort Union group of the upper Missouri, and are Eocene-Tertiary; also, 
that the lower part of the group, at least at the locality two hundred miles east of the 
mountains, is the equivalent of a part of the Lignitic strata of Wyoming. 

Second. The Judith River beds have their equivalent along the eastern edge of 
the mountains below the Lignite or Fort Union group, and also in Wyoming, and 
are Cretaceous, although of a higher horizon than the coal-bearing strata of Coalville 
and Bear River, Utah. They form either the upper part of the Fox Hill group or 
a group called "Number Six." 

In his annual report to Ha} r den for the same year (1874, printed in 
L875), Lesquereux went over all the ground once more, showing to his 
own satisfaction, presumably, the conclusive character of the evidence 
offered by fossil plant remains, and announced again his conviction to 
the effect that the authority of animal remains should be unquestioned 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY THE LARAMIE QUESTION. 655 

so far as it relates to marine formations, but when land formations are 
considered, the plant remains should be given precedence." 

Meanwhile. Dr. C. A. White, paleontologist, became connected with 
the Hayden survey, being assigned for his first season's work (1877) 
to the area of northwestern Colorado. In this connection he came 
quickly in contact with the problem we have been discussing, and 
early committed himself in favor of the post-Cretaceous age of the 
beds in question. 

He argued that it was a well-known fact that the evolutional advance 
of the vegetable kingdom had been greater on this continent than in 
Europe. Hence, a student of the flora of the American strata, using 
a series of European standards, would naturally refer those which he 
found to contain certain vegetable forms to the Tertiary period, while 
the associated or superimposed remains of animal life might all show 
them to be of Cretaceous age. according to the same series of Euro- 
pean standards. 

Taking into consideration the fact that the physical changes which 
took place in western North America during the Mesozoic and 
Cenozoic periods were very gradual and without any important break, 
he would be led to expect to find those animals, whose existence was 
not necessarily affected by a change from a saline to a fresh condition 
of the waters, to have propagated their respective types beyond the 
period which those types in their culmination distinctly characterized. 
For this reason he felt that these perpetuated types did not necessarily 
prove the Cretaceous age of the strata, they being evidently the" last 
of their kind, and because, moreover, all the other known fossil 
remains of the group indicated a later period. He would, therefore, 
refer the beds, which had now, according to an agreement between 
King and Hayden, become known as the Laramie, to a post-Cretaceous 
age. 

Referring again to the matter in his report for 1877, White conceded 
that Cretaceous types (dinosaurs) of vertebrate animals were found in 
the higher strata of the Laramie group and did not question the cor- 
rectness of referring the plant remains even of the very lowest beds 
to the Tertiary; noting also that the invertebrate fossils were indeci- 
sive, since the species were new to science and could not be safely 
compared with those found elsewhere. Without committing himself, 
he then offered a suggestion in effect as follows: Since none of the 
American Cretaceous could be considered as equivalent to the Lower 
Cretaceous of other parts of the world, but must be considered as 

a Marsh, it may be noted incidentally, in 1877, in discussing the problem of the 
boundary between the Cretaceous and Tertiary, announced that in his opinion the 
evidence of the numerous vertebrate remains was decisive in favor of the Cretaceous 
view. 



656 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEU.M, 1904. 

Upper Cretaceous, these Laramie rocks which, if Cretaceous at all, 
were certainly at the very top of the Upper Cretaceous, must repre- 
sent a great and important period wholly unrepresented in any other 
part of the world. 

Further, the finding- of evidence of an abundant mammalian life 
(Tertiary) immediately following- the Laramie period, which in itself 
contained only Cretaceous vertebrate remains (dinosaurs), suggested 
to him a sudden ushering in of the Tertiary types which could be 
accounted for only on the supposition that such originated elsewhere, 
and were contemporaneously in existence with the Cretaceous forms, 
i. e., prior to the close of the Laramie period. Their apparent sudden 
appearance could then be accounted for on the supposition that the 
physical barrier was removed by somet>f the various earth movements 
connected with the evolution of the continent. 

To these same opinions he held in his report for 1878, adding that, 
if the conclusions of all the leading paleontologists regarding the 
Eocene-Tertiary age of the Wasatch, Green River, and Bridger groups 
be accepted, "then is there additional evidence of the correctness of 
the view that the Laramie is a transitional group between the Creta- 
ceous and Tertiary, partaking of the faunal characteristics of both 
periods." 

Hayden, in his report for this year (1878), argued that the Fort 
Union beds of the upper Missouri River are the equivalent of the 
Lignitic formation, as it exists along the base of the Rocky Mountains 
in Colorado, and of the Bitter Creek series west of the mountains; 
also that it was probable that the brackish-water beds on the Upper 
Missouri must be correlated with the Laramie, and that the Wasatch 
group, as now defined, and the Fort Union group are identical as a 
whole, or in part, at least. 

In his report on the systematic geology of the Fortieth Parallel 
Survey (1878), King again attacked the advocates of the Eocene age of 
these beds. He reviewed the evidence and announced his convictions, 
as before, in favor of their being Cretaceous. 

He agreed with Hayden in regarding the Laramie and underlying 
Fox Hill as strictly conformable, but found a very decided unconforma- 
bility between the uppermost Laramie containing the dinosaur remains 
and the immediately overlying rocks of the Vermilion Creek group, 
which carried mammalian remains. The unconformity here mentioned 
for the first time is, with the exception of the suggestion made by Peale, 
perhaps the most important feature yet introduced into the discussion, 
and it is probable, as elsewhere suggested 1>} T King, that had Hayden 
seen this locality earlier, the question as to the exact position of the 
Laramie beds might never have arisen. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY THE LARAMIE QUESTION. G57 

His conclusions, as summed up in his recapitulation of the Mesozoic, 

are as follows: 

The Laramie, by its own vertebrate remains, is proved to be unmistakably Cre- 
taceous and the last deposit of that age, and it contains no exclusively fresh-water 
life. Its plants resemble European Tertiary, but its Dinosaurs are conclusive of 
Cretaceous age. It was the last of the conformable marine deposits of middle 
America. Its latest period of sedimentation was immediately followed by an ener- 
getic orographic disturbance, which closed the Mesozoic age. In that orographic 
action the inter-American ocean was obliterated and the Cretaceous locally thrown 
into great and steep folds. The following deposits over the Green River area were 
fresh-water lacustrine lowest Eocene strata, lain down nonconformably with the 
Cretaceous, except in accidental localities. 

In 1885 the problem was taken up by L. F. Ward in an exhaustive 
paper on the Flora of the Laramie Group. This, although destruc- 
tive in its criticism rather than decisive, nevertheless contained many 
important suggestions. After a summary of opinions held by pre- 
vious workers, he wrote: 

Taking all these facts into consideration, therefore, I do not hesitate to say that the 
Laramie flora as closely resembles the Senonian ( Cretaceous ) flora as it does either the 
Eocene or the Miocene flora, but I would insist that this does not necessarily prove 
either the Cretaceous age of the Laramie group or its simultaneous deposit with any 
of the Upper Cretaceous beds. The laws of variation and geographical distribution 
forbid us to make any such sweeping deductions. With regard to the first point, it 
is wholly immaterial whether we call the Laramie Cretaceous or Tertiary, so long as 
we correctly understand its relations to the beds above and below it. We know that 
the strata immediately beneath are recognized Upper Cretaceous, and we equally 
know that the strata above are recognized Lower Tertiary. Whether the first inter- 
mediate deposit be known as Cretaceous or Tertiary is, therefore, merely a question 
of name, and its decision one way or another can not advance our knowledge in the 
least. 

In this, it will be noted, he followed closely the opinions already 
expressed by Hayden. 

Other statements of Ward's in this connection are worthy of consid- 
eration. He pointed out that there was no probability that the condi- 
tions existing during the Laramie deposition would be ever exactly 
reproduced elsewhere, and hence the chances were as infinity to one 
against the existence of other beds that should contain an invertebrate 
fauna identical with that of the Laramie group. Further than this, 
he regarded the law laid down by paleontologists that the same epochs 
in geologic time produced the same living forms, as quite contrary to 
the now well-established principles of geographical distribution. 

Amidst all this confusion and conflict of opinion, the fact was becom- 
ing more and more apparent that under the term Laramie had been 
included beds belonging to various but not widely separated horizons. 
King and Hayden, it will be recalled, had believed it to contain all the 
coal beds of the region in which it occurs and to be sharply circum- 
xat mus 1904 42

scribed both above unci below, the main point in dispute being whether 
it should be relegated to the Cretaceous or the Tertiary. As time went 
on, but particularly after the organization of the present survey, more 
careful and detailed work became possible. The Bear River beds were 
shown by Drs. C. A. White and T. W. Stanton, in 1891, to belong- to 
the marine Cretaceous; the upper portion in Colorado and Wyoming- 
was found by Cross, Hills, and Weed to be out of harmony with that 
beneath, and was relegated to the Eocene-Tertiary; the Laramie proper 
becoming- more and more restricted as the work of differentiation 
went on. 

In 1897 Drs. F. H. Knowlton and T. W. Stanton, the one a paleo- 
botanist and the other a paleontologist, together made a personal 
inspection of many of the important localities, and, after passing the 
evidence in review, concluded that the so-called Ceratops beds of 
Converse County, Wyoming, should be referred to the Laramie group; 
that the coal-bearing series of the Laramie Plains is older than the 
"true" Laramie, and, instead of conformably overlying the Fox Hills 
group, is itself overlain by it. 

The Bitter Creek and Black Buttes beds they considered as belong- 
ing to the "true 17 Laramie, and also those of Crow Creek, Colorado. 
while those of Point of Rocks, in the Bitter Creek Valley, were regarded 
as Cretaceous (Montana). The base of the Laramie (after a review of 
the opinions of Hatcher, Hills, King, and Hayden) they would place 
"immediately above the highest marine Cretaceous beds of the Rocky 
Mountain region,' 1 the top being marked by the Fort Union beds. In 
other words, the Fort Union beds are now regarded as Eocene and the 
lower-lying as Laramie Cretaceous. 

Both these workers, it is well to note, conformed to the generally 
received opinion that "marine invertebrates (fossils) are more accu- 
rate and definite horizon markers than either plants or nonmarine 
invertebrates, because they have a less extended vertical and a broader 
geographic distribution." 

(). C. Marsh, the reader will perhaps remember, had in L891 
announced the general principle that all forms of animal life are of 
value as horizon markers "mainly according to the perfection of their 
organization or zoological rank." Following out this principle, he 
regarded plants as unsatisfactory witnesses, invertebrates as much 
better, and vertebrates as the best of all, as offering "reliable evidence 
of climatic and other geological chansres." 



CHAPTER XI. 

THE TACONIC QUESTION. 

"Now, who shall arbitrate? 

Ten men love what I hate, 
Shun what I follow, slight what 1 receive; 

Ten, who in ears and eyes, 
Match me; we all surmise, 

They, this thing, and I, that; 
Whom shall my soul believe?" 

It is presumably scarcely necessary to call attention to the fact that 
the older rocks of the earth's crust are exposed, in a majority of cases, 
only where this crust has been disturbed through such folding and 
faulting as is incidental to mountain making. As a result of such 
processes these older rocks are, in the main, considerably altered and 
their origin as well as geological age at times quite indeterminable. 

The attempt to fix the base of the Paleozoic strata or, in other 
words, to find a line of demarkation and division- between the non- 
fossil-bearing and the most ancient members of the overlying fossilif- 
erous strata has, therefore, proven a matter of the greatest difficulty 
both in America and abroad. In Great Britain and on the Continent 
manifestation of this is found in the voluminous literature relating to 
Sedgwick's Cambrian and Murchison's Silurian systems. In America 
a similar controversy was contemporaneously waged, which has come 
down to history under the name of the Taconic question. 

In his report on the second geological district of New York, pub- 
lished in 1842, Ebenezer Emmons gave his first detailed account of the 
Taconic system. A review of the subject may well, therefore, begin 
with this paper, though an occasional earlier reference may be 
necessary. 

In his report for 1838 Emmons had stated that the Potsdam sand- 
stone was the oldest sedimentary rock occurring in the vicinity of 
Potsdam (New York) and that no rock intervened between it and the 
primary. In this opinion, to which he ever afterwards adhered, he 
was quite correct. Overlying the Potsdam sandstone and always in 
the same order he found the Calciferous sandrock, the Chazy, Bird's- 
eye, and Trenton limestones, the Utica and Hudson River slates, etc. 

An examination of the country at the foot of the Hoosac Mountains 
in western Massachusetts showed what appealed to him an entirely dif- 
ferent series resting, like the Potsdam, directly upon the gneiss, but in

was described in his own words as below, the order of superposition

1. A coarse granular limestone of various colors which I have denominated the 
Stockbridge limestone, taking its name from a well-known locality, one which has fur- 
nished the different parts of the Union a large portion of the white and clouded 
marbles which have been so extensively employed for building and other purposes 
in construction. 

L'. Granular quartz rock, generally fine grained, in firm, tough, crystalline masses 
of a brown color, but sometimes white, granular, and friable. 

.'!. Slate, which for distinction I have denominated Magnesian slate, from its con- 
taining magnesia, a fact which is distinctly indicated by the soft feel peculiar to rocks 
when this earth forms a constituent part. 

4. Sparry limestone, generally known as the Sparry limerock. 

5. A slate, which I have named Taconic slate, and which is found at the western 
base of the Taconic range. It lies adjacent to the Lorrain or Hudson River shales, 
some varieties of which it resembles. In composition it contains more alumina and 
less magnesia than the magnesian slates. 

The series occupied an area extending- trom the Hoosac Mountains 
westward, passing* over the Hoosac Valley, Saddle Mountain, and also 
over the high ridge of granular quartz known as Oak Hill, just north 
of the Williamstown Plain, the Taconic Mountains next west of the 
Massachusetts boundary, and the eastern border of New York west of 
this boundary to the Hudson. 

To this series, which Emmons conceived to be older than the Pots- 
dam, he proposed in 1841 to give the name Taconic, after the Taconic

range, elevating it to the dignity of a system. His persistent advocacy 
of the actuality of this system gave rise to a controversy extending 
over more than half a century and equaled by none in the annals of 
American geology, not exceeded even by the Eozoon question noted 
elsewhere. Unmoved by argument, to the day of his death Emmons 
adhered faithfully to his ''system,' 1 although from the very first he 
noted its most inherent weakness — that in no case had the Potsdam 
sandstone been found resting upon any of its members. That this 
system was actually an older, lower- lying series was indicated only by 
the fact that neither were any of its members found intercalated with 
the overlying series, which always occupied the position and relation- 
ship given above. 

It must be remarked, by way of preliminary explanation, however, 
that the region, as shown by subsequent studies, is one where fault- 
ing, folding, erosion, and metamorphism have prevailed to an extent 
then undreamed of, and where, as a consequence, all natural criteria 
had become so obscured as to make a prompt solution of the problem 
impossible. The science of geology grows through cumulative evi-

deuce. The' greatest minds and the most acute of observers were 
bound, by the then existing condition of knowledge, to make incom- 
plete observations and faulty deductions. 

The original section, as noted, was some fifteen miles in length. 




The rocks were all pronounced as unfossiliferous and dipped through- 
out to the eastward, their relative ages being judged wholly by super- 
position, the Stock bridge limestone, where it rested immediately upon 
the gneiss, being regarded as the oldest of the series. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY — THE TACONtC QUESTION. 663 

The first announcement of this conclusion appears to have been 
made at the Philadelphia meeting of the American Association of 
Geologists and Naturalists, held in April, 1841. Unfortunately 
neither the paper nor the discussion which followed was printed in 
detail. It is stated by Dana, however, that the matter was discussed 
by II. I). Rogers, Edward Hitchcock, William Mather, James Hall, 
and Lardner Vanuxem, all of whom had worked in the region. It is 
stated, further, that none of the gentlemen, with the exception of 
Vanuxem, favored the views put forward by Emmons. 

During the summer following both Rogers and Hall studied the sec- 
tion, as described by Emmons, in the field, Rogers rendering a report 
to the American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia at the meeting 
in 1842. In this report Rogers sustained the views previously advo- 
cated by Hitchcock, Hall, Mather, and himself, to the effect that the 
rocks were Lower Silurian (as the term was then used) extending from 
the Potsdam upward, but much Hexed and disguised by partial meta- 
morphism. Hall for some reasons failed to make a report at the time, 
though later claiming to have written out his notes very fully (see 
p. 671). 

In his paper in the Report on the Geology of the Second District of 
New York, in 1842, where the system is first elaborated, Emmons 
referred to Rogers's conclusions, and seemingly himself recognized 
the possibility of the various beds of limestone being but portions of 
the same bed, brought to the surface by successive uplift. He did 
not, however, regard the same as probable. The system as a whole 
he thought to be the equivalent of the Lower Cambrian of Sedgwick, 
the upper portion being the lower part of the Silurian system. 

Although the Proceedings of the American Association of Geolo- 
gists were not given in full, as already noted, the opinions of Mather 
regarding the Taconie have fortunately been handed down to us in his 
Report on the Geology of the First New York District, dated 1843. In 
this he made use of the term in his descriptions, but stated emphatically 
that the "Taconie rocks are the same in age as those of the Champlain 
division, but modified by metamorphic agency and the intrusion of 
plutonic rock." 

In December, 1844, Emmons brought out in pamphlet form a revision 
of the Taconie system, with additions and an extension of its limits. 
This was published without change as a chapter in his Report on the 
Agriculture of New York, under date of 1846. The most important 
feature of this revision related to the finding of fossil crustacean 
remains in the Black slate of Bald Mountain, in Washington County, 
New York. These he accounted for on the supposition that the beds, 
instead of being the lowermost, as he first supposed, belonged in 
reality to the top of the series, and had come into their present posi- 
tion through a reversion of the strata, adopting thus in part Rogers's 



664 



REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



ideas as to flexures and overthrust faults. The order of succession of 
the strata would then stand as below, that given in the paper of 1S42 
being introduced for comparison. It will be at once noted, as later 
charged by Dana (1888), that "the system is for the most part turned 
the other side up."

The system as here outlined, Emmons argued, occupied a position 
inferior to the Champlain division of the New York s} 7 stem, or the 
lower division of the Silurian system of Mr. Murchison. 

The fossils found in 
the Black slate, it 
should be mentioned, 
were Trilobites — 
Atops trilineatus, a 
form allied to Triar- 
thrus beckii and Ell/ip- 
t<ic< phala asaplu>i< It s, 
and annelid markings, 
chiefly those of Neire- 
ites and Myrianites. These were described by Hall in 1846, and the 
ground taken that the Atops smd Triarthrus were identical and refer- 
able to the Hudson River group, the Elliptocephala being referred to 
the genus Olenus® an Upper Cambrian form. 

At the Boston meeting (1847) of the Association of American Geolo- 
gists and Naturalists, Prof. C. B. Adams discussed the Taconic rocks 
of the northern part of Addison County, Vermont, a locality judged 
to be particularly favorable for study, since the rocks pass here from 
a highly to but slightly metamorphosed and disturbed condition. He 
exhibited sections of Snake and Bald mountains and from Lake Cham- 
plain to the Green Mountains, and thought to show that the Taconic 
quartz rock was probably the metamorphic equivalent of the red sand- 
rock (regarded by Adams as belonging to the Champlain division of 
the New York geologists), and that the Stockbridge limestone was the 
equivalent of the calcareous rocks overling the red sandrock, rather 
than that of the lower limestone of the Champlain division.

Inasmuch as the value of the evidence furnished by the fossil remains 
had become largely a matter of individual opinion, a committee, of 
which Mr. S. S. Haldeman was chairman, was appointed at the same 
meeting- of the association to investigate. The report, as given by this 
committee in the American Journal of Science for 1848, was to the 
effect that so far as could be determined from the fragmental character 
of the specimens submitted, Atqps and Triarthrus were not identical. 
but A. triMneatus was "a fossil characteristic of the stratum invest i 
gated and named bv Professor Emmons." 




Fig. 134. — EUiptocephala asaphoides. a is a large individual much flattened by pressure; the natural 
joints of the slate pass through the specimen. The tail ami a portion of tin.- body are wanting. I 
have named this EUiptocephala asaphoides. The ellipse upon the buckler appears to be a charac- 
teristic marking, while the ribs and middle lobe resemble very strongly the same parts of the 
Asaphus tyrannns. In its perfect form the ellipse seemsto belong to the old and perfect individual. 
?j is the head of a small individual of the same species. The ellipse in this individual has an 
anterior segment not to l»- seen in «, which I suppose may be obliterated by age. c is a fragment 
ei a trilobite, probably, but the ribs bear a different character from those we generally meet with. 

To this report Hall naturally took exception, and in the Journal for 
the same year reviewed the subject and published figures giving rea- 
sons for thinking that the distinctions noted by the committee were 
not ".actual and constant/ 1 but merely those of individuals, and reaf- 
firming the statement that the two forms were essentially identical. 
Hall was iti turn replied to by Emmons, but nothing conclusive was 
brought forward.

In 1849 the ubiquitous Hunt entered the Held, siding, as il chanced, 
with the opinions of the opponents of the system, though later lie 
shifted his ground. No new facts were, however, presented, and the 
matter is mentioned here only on account of the characteristically 
emphatic and apparently decisive manner in which his opinions were 
expressed, however fanciful may have been their basis. 

Little of consequence now occurred until L855, when Professor 
Emmons brought out his volume on American Geology, in which he 
made his third presentation on the subject. In this he extended the 
system from Maine to Georgia and subdivided it into an upper and 
lower portion, the fossiliferous portion being called the Upper Taconic 
and the nonfossiliferous the Lower Taconic. The Sparry and Stock- 
bridge limestones were brought together as one formation, while the 
s3 T nclinal character of Mount Greylock was recognized and figured.

As here given, the system, as stated by Dana with reference to that 
ot 1844, had a top and bottom of Cambrian rocks. The succession in the 

Lower Taconic was the same as 
in the publication of 1844. 

In 1854 or 1855 trilobites re- 
lated to those of Bald Moun- 
tain were found in the Black 
slates of West Georgia, Ver- 
mont. Passing into the hands 
of Zadock Thompson, the as- 
sistant in the geological survey 
of the State, the specimens 
were sent to Professor Hall, 
and in 185!> were figured and described as belonging to the shales of 
the Hudson River group, one of the minor subdivisions of the Lower 
Silurian system, under the names of Olenus thompsoni, 0. vermontana, 
and Peltura holopyga, the beds being thus, in his opinion, made equiv- 
alent to the Bald Mountain slates already noted. In this he was, how- 
ever, in error. 

The problem was not, how T ever, confined to American soil. In L856 
there were found in the limestone belonging to the so-called graywacke 
series at Point Levi, opposite Quebec, a trilobite fauna of a nature 
sufficient to convert the paleontologist, Elkanah Billings, of the Cana- 
dian survey, to the views of Emmons, and cause him to affirm that the

graywacke group lay below the Trenton in stratigraphic position." 
In this view Logan at first acquiesced, but applied to the beds as there 
developed the name Quebec rather than Taconic, subsequently extend- 
ing the name to the whole belt of Taconic rocks reaching from the St. 
Lawrence to the Hudson River. 

In I860 Barrande, the eminent Bohemian paleontologist and authority 
on the Silurian, read before the Geological Society of France a memoir 
in which he adopted in full the conclusions of Emmons regarding the 
Taconic system, pronouncing the Georgia, Vermont, trilobites as 
unquestionably of Primordial age and characteristic of a great Taconic 
system extending far below the Olenus or J*<ir<i<!o.r/<l<s b zone. 

Subsequent discoveries seemed to show 
that Barrande was misled through the 
character of the evidence available, he 
himself not having studied the question 
in the field. Be this as it may, his ac- 
cession to the ranks of the ^Taconists** 
for a time greatly strengthened their 
cause, through sheer weight of authority, 
and did much to complicate the situation, 
while the use made of his writings and 
personal letters by Marcou swelled the 
literature and confused the question until 
for a time the correct solution seemed 
hopeless. And here it may he remarked 
that, however conclusive and convincing 
the writings of Marcou may appear, the arguments he advanced were 
founded almost altogether upon the works of others, or. in some cases,

" Subsequent investigations have shewn that the masses in which these fossils were 
found were but blocks or fragments in a conglomerate, itself a member of the Que- 
bec group. Billings's conversion was, however, thorough, as shown by the following: 

Montreal, 10th Nov., 1860. 
My Dear Mr. Meek: 

* * * The discovery of the Point Levi fossils, and also of those published by 
Hall under the name of Olenus (from Vermont), opens out a new field in American 
geology. I have received several letters from Barrande on the subject. In the last 
one received, two days ago, he says that Angelin was then in Paris, and that he had 
shown him both Hall's figures and mine. Angelin agrees with him that Hall's 
species, and also mine from limestone No. 1, are of the Primordial type. The Que- 
bec rocks are undoubtedly the Taconic rocks of Emmons. It will be rare sport if 
Emmons, after standing alone for 25 years against the majority of the Uite (or at 
least those who consider themselves the elite) of American geologists, should after 
all be right. His unfortunate Taconic system has been annihilated and proved not 
to exist regularly once a year for the last twenty years, and yet it once more raises 
its head with a new life. I firmly believe that in the main lie is right, although he 
may be wrong in some minor details. * * *

upon no other basis than prejudice in favor of or against certain indi- 
viduals. From the time of his Pacific Railroad survey work Marcou 
did scarcely anything- in the field, but contented himself with sitting 
as critic upon the work of others. For this reason he was of little 
actual service to American geology and his writings and opinions 
are not quoted in detail here, although unquestionably many of his 
suggestions were of value. 

In 1861 there was issued the final report on the geology of Vermont 
by Hitchcock and A. D. Hager. On paleontological evidence the 
Stockbi'idge limestone was here set down as not older than Silurian. 
Cross sections showed Mounts Anthony, Equinox, iEolus, and others 
to have a synclinal structure, the limestone beneath and the slates above 
as Emmons had shown for Mount Greylock. The stratigraphy was, 
therefore, in favor of Emmons's view, but the paleontology was 
against it and no decision was reached as to the age of the quartzite. 
In 1863, the year of Emmons's death, there appeared the first edition 
of 1 )ana's ( reology. In this the Potsdam sandstone was made to include 
the Primordial and the equivalent of the era 
of the Paradox !<l(s and the Primordial beds 
of Scandinavia and Bohemia. The Georgia 
slates were also recognized as Primordial, in 
this conforming to the ideas of Barrande and 
Emmons. 

In 1869 Prof. J. B. Perry, of Vermont, 
entered the lists and argued in favor of the 
system as presented by Emmons. He was 
subsequently shown, through the discovery of 
fossils and the existence of numerous unsus- 
pected faults and folds, to have been in error. 
In 1870 the Rev. A. Wing, of Vermont, working with the avowed 
intention of settling the vexed question as to the age of the limestone, 
slates, and quartzites in the West Rutland region, found fossils in the 
limestone which Billings identified as probably belonging to the Chazy 
epoch of the Canadian (Lower Silurian) period. Still others were 
found, sufficient to show that the beds range from the Calciferous to 
and including the Trenton, and that consequently the overlying slates 
must be of Utica or Hudson River age, and were not limited to the 
Quebec group, as Logan had supposed. 

In 1872 Elkanah Billings published in the Canadian Naturalist an 
article on the age of the black slate and red sandrock of Vermont, in 
which he took occasion to refer to the Taconic system and announce 
his views on the subject. He contended that in the consideration of 
this question ''nearly all of the leading geologists of North America 11 
had ranged themselves upon the wrong side; that, while for nearly a 
quarter of a century Doctor Emmons stood almost alone, during the last 




Fig. 137. — Glenn* rrrinonliiiKi. 



AMERICAN GEOLOGY THE TACONIC QUESTION.

thirteen years a great revolution of opinion had come about; and that 
the idea that the rocks of the Taconic system were really above the 
Potsdam sandstone (as had been contended) had been exploded. (See 
letter to Meek quoted above) 

As he understood the matter at the time of writing, some of the 
Taconic rocks were certainly more ancient than the Potsdam, while 
others might be of the same age, and perhaps some of them more 
recent. The details, he felt, had not yet been worked out, and on 
account of the extremely complicated structure of the region, he ven- 
tured to say that no man at that time living would ever see a perfect 
map of the Taconic region. The present indications are favorable to 
this view of the subject. 

The theory that the Taconic rocks belong to the Hudson River 
group, he went on to say, was an w * enormous error"' that originated 
in the geological survey of New York and thence found its way into 
the Canadian survey. The mistake was 
doubtless due to the extraordinary arrange- 
ment of the rocks, the more ancient strata 
being elevated and often shoved over the 
more recent, so that, without the aid of 
paleontology, it was impossible to assert 
positively that they were not the age of the 
Hudson River formation, as they appeared 
to be. The main object of his note was ac- 
knowledged to be, to show that while the 
error had originated in New York, it was 
corrected by thegeologieal survey of Canada. 

This article brought out a reply by J. D. 
Dana in the American Journal of Sci- 
ence for June, 1872, in which he called 
Billings's attention to the fact that, while he, Dana, might differ 
with Billings about the Taconic, the differences, after all. were not 
material, since Billings viewed the Taconic as developed by Emmons 
through successive interpolations year after year, and not as first 
announced in 1842. He called his attention, further, to the fact that 
the system was based on a section fifteen miles long, made across the 
Taconic Range, through Williamstown and Grevlock, to North Adams 
on the east and to Petersburg or Berlin on the west; that the dip was 
originally throughout to the eastward; and that the beds were desti- 
tute of fossils and their relative age judged by superposition, accord- 
ing to which the Stockbridge or North Adams limestone — the most 
eastern rock in the section — would be the most recent. 

Referring to Emmons's discovery of a fossiliferous black slate at 
Bald Mountain, New York, he stated that, according to Emmons's 
principle adopted in 1812, this slate being to the w r est of the Taconic. 




Fig. 138.— Elkanah Billings. 



670 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

should be older than the Taconic proper, and therefore that his Taconic 
.system was actually newer than the fossiliferous rock. This evidently 
being to his (Emmons's) mind impossible, he was thence led to think 
out a way by which rocks might dip eastward and still be newer to the 
westward and that, ""without a fact or even an argument to sustain it, 
he announced in his agricultural report, published in 1843, this as the 
true order. He thus, by a stroke of his pen, tipped over the Taconic 
system and got the black slate to the top with all other Taconic rocks 
beneath it." 

This black slate interpolation in 1S43, according to Dana, thus 
brought mischief to the Taconic system and to much American 
geology and was styled by him "a most desperate blunder." Bil- 
lings's work he regarded as eliminating the black slates from the 
system. Dana went on to state that the quartzite, which in the pub- 
lication of 1842 occurred toward the middle of the section, was, in that 
of 1843, placed at the bottom of the Taconic series. Hence in this 
"perfected Taconic" the rocks which Billings had shown to be nearest 
to the pre-Silurian of all the Taconic beds were thus placed at the 
remote ends of the system, the black slate at the top and the quartzite 
at the bottom, the former being of Primordial age and the only rock 
series which had yet proven to be pre-Potsdam. 

Dana acknowledged that Emmons was deserving of honor for com- 
bating the old idea which had prevailed among geologists and paleon- 
tologists, to the effect that the Taconic slates belong to the Hudson 
River period; yet he contended that he ''blundered in everything 
else," determining nothing correctly as regarded the age or order of 
succession of the rocks of the system, and "his assumptions after 1S42 
were so great as to order of stratification and faults, and his way of 
sweeping distant rocks into his system so unscientific, that his oppo- 
nents had abundant reasons for their doubts/' He went on to say 
that no one knew, even at that date, what the precise age of the slates 
of the Taconic Mountains might be. although Logan's view that they 
belong to the Quebec seemed nearest the truth. The only way, he 
argued, for geologists to get out of the Taconic perplexity was to go 
back to Emmons's original report and section of 1842. "The name 
Taconic," he wrote, " belongs only to the era represented by the rocks 
of the Taconic Mountain," and nowhere else. 

In a series of articles in the American Journal of Science, beginning 
with December of 1872. Dana showed the conforinability of the 
Taconic slates and schists of the Taconic Mountains and the Stock- 
bridge limestone and quartzite, and on the basis of the discoveries of 
Wing and Billings, pronounced the limestone to be of Trenton and 
( "hazy age and the schists and slates to be of Hudson River age, in 
this agreeing with Rogers. He also pointed out that the same beds of 
metamorphic rocks might vary as do their unconsolidated representa-

tives, being quartzite in one part and mica-schist or even gneiss else- 
where, and hence that purely lithological evidence as to the identity 
of beds was practically worthless. This is ;i little amusing as coming 
from Dana, who himself accepted the presence of the mineral chondro- 
dite in the limestones of Berkshire as evidence of the Archean age. 

In 1878, T. Nelson Dale found hrachiopods belonging to the Hudson 
River group in the Taconic slates at Poughkeepsie. In this same year 
W. B. Dwight began work in the " Sparry limestone " of Dutchess 
County, New York, finding fossils of undoubted Lower Silurian age." 
These finds and others made by S. W. Ford and I. P. Bishop in 
adjacent localities were made use of by Professor Dana in his subse- 
quent papers. 

Dana continued in the field at intervals until 18S<:>, accepting as his 
working basis the ('hazy fossils found by Doctor Wing at West Rut- 
land, and accompanying and working conjointly with Wing throughout 
the period. In 1879 he showed on stratigraphic and fossiliferous 
evidence that the Taconic schists, so called, as developed in Dutchess 
and adjacent counties, were of the age of the Hudson River group, 
and the five limestone belts there found, but five successive outcrop- 
pings of the Lower Silurian limestone brought to the surface by a 
series of flexures. In this he agreed in the main with Mather. 

In 1884, Hall for the first time put himself fully on record as opposed 
to the Taconic system on stratigraphic as well as paleontological 
grounds. In this year he sent Dana copies of two sections of the 
Taconic area and manuscript notes claimed by him to have been made 
prior to 1845, and which gave the result of his own studies. In these 
Mounts Anthony and Equinox art 1 shown to have a synclinal structure, 
the limestone underlying a broad synclinal of slates and schists, the 
former being put down as Trenton and lower, while the slates and 
schists were of Hudson River age. Prompt publication would have 
given Hall priority over the Vermont survey and others, but owing 
to the long delay the matter is of only historical interest. 

In Volumes XXIX and XXXlll (1885 and 18ST)of the American Jour- 
nal of Science. Dana again takes up the subject systematically under the 
caption of Taconic Rocks and Stratigraphy, the paper being accom- 
panied by a map of the region and numerous sections. He showed 
that the flexures throughout the Taconic area were of a prevailing- 
synclinal habit; that the limestone was a continuous formation lying 
underneath the mountains and was overlaid conformably by strata of 
quartzite and quartzitic and ordinary mica schist, and underlaid along 
the eastern border by quartzite and mica schist also. He further 
showed that within the Taconic region the texture and mineral nature 
of the limestone beds varied geographically, the crystalline texture 
being coarser to the southward and eastward. He found no evidence 



'Dwight later found Cambrian fossils in these same rocks.

KEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904, 



of general overthrust faulting affecting the entire region. As to the 
age of the rocks he remained conservative, but still regarded the lime- 
stone as beyond doubt Lower Silurian, though whether Trenton, 
Chazy, or Caleiferous remained an open question. 

•In the Journal for 1886 he referred again to the matter, questioning 
the reliability of the lithological evidence put forth by Emmons as to 
the identity of his Taconic rocks and those of Sedgwick's Cambrian, 
asserting that '•' geological investigation with reference to the Cambrian 
had not advanced so far as to make its application safe." In this paper 
he reported also the finding in Canaan, New York, of Lower Silurian 
fossils in Sparry limestone, this being the oldest stratum of the Taconic 
system, as announced by Emmons in L84± These fossils were sliced 
and studied by Professor Dwight, of Poughkeepsie, and S. W. Ford, 
and identified as Belonging probably to the Trenton period. 

In 1886, C. D. Walcott, then paleontologist of the U. S. Geological 

Survey, took up the subject, giving a sum- 
mary of his results, with map, in the Ameri- 
can Journal of Science of April and May, 
1888. Walcott began with a systematic 
study of the slates, limestones, and quartz- 
ites of Vermont and the adjoining counties 
of New York, continuing his work the fol- 
lowing season and paying particular atten- 
tion to areas within the counties of Washing- 
ton and Rensselaer, New York; Bennington. 
Vermont: and Berkshire, Massachusetts, 
since here were found the series of sections 
described by Emmons and nearly all the 
localities mentioned by him. 

Mr. Walcott showed to his own satisfac- 
tion and that of most of those having any detailed knowledge of 
the subject that the qUartzite series belong to the Middle Cam- 
brian, the talcose slates to the Upper Cambrian, the limestones to 
the Caleiferous," Chazy, and Trenton, and the slates and sandstones 
to the Hudson River group. He agreed mainly with Emmons in 
his lithological descriptions and the general dip and arrangement of 
the strata, but disagreed with him in his identification of the geo- 
logical age of the formations of the Lower Taconic, the strati- 
graphic relations of his Lower and Upper Taconic, and also as to 
the value of the stratigraphic and paleontological identifications of 
age. He showed that the granular quartz, supposed by Emmons 
to be unfossiliferous and to lie at the base of his Taconic system, was 
actually fossiliferous and the equivalent of the greater portion of the 




Fig. 139.— Charles Doolittle Walcott. 



"The supposed Middle Cambrian ami a part of the Caleiferous here described were 
subsequently relegated to the Lower Cambrian.

673 



Upper Taconic;" also that this quartzite was a shore deposit formed 
at the same time as were the silico-calcareous muds in deeper waters, 
and which Emmons had included in his Upper Taconic. The Stock- 
bridge limestone, which Emmons had regarded as a peculiar p re- 
Silurian deposit, he showed on paleontological evidence to be the 
equivalent of the Trenton, Chazy, and Calciferous limestones of the 
Lower Silurian, 6 while the Talcose slate resting conformably upon the 
Stockbridge limestone was found to contain graptolites of Hudson 
River age. Emmons's subdivision of Upper Taconic he regarded as 
merely due to a repetition of certain beds brought up by an overthrust 
fault, as shown in fig. 140. 

Walcott in his summary of the paleontological evidence relative to 
the Taconic, stated: (1) The trilobites described by Emmons in 1811-

JVereites and other trails which Emmons regarded as typical for the 
Taconic had not yet been stratigraphically located, while (5) the grap- 
tolites formed part of the fauna of the Hudson terrane. 

Emmons's errors, according to Mr. Walcott, were due almost wholly 
to his trust in lithological characters; his supposed unconformity 
between the Taconic and Champlain systems was based primarily on 
the similarity in lithologic characters of the Calciferous sand rock of 
the Lower Silurian, and the Calciferous sand rock of what is now 
known, from its fossils, to be a part of his upper Taconic; also that 
he confused the dark shales of the Lower Silurian with those of his 
upper Taconic and failed to recognize the obvious fact that the Cal- 
ciferous terranes were frequently represented in geological sections by 
a shale undistinguishable from that of the Hudson River; and that in 
several places the Trenton limestone is replaced by shale. According 
to T. N. Dale, Emmons was also in error in assuming that the slates 
along the east foot of the Taconic range dipped to the east, he having 
confused cleavage with bedding.

At the eighth meeting of the American Committee of the Interna- 
tional Geological Congress, which was held in New York in April, 
1888, the subject of the subdivision and nomenclature of the American 
Paleozoic formations was discussed, and incidentally the matter of 
using the name Taconic, and its limitations, if used at all,' was pretty 
thoroughly gone over. A considerable diversity of opinion was found 
to exist; although the committee at first reported in favor of retaining 
the name, they were apparently subsequently led to change their views 
upon the presentation of new evidence by Mr. Walcott. A brief sum- 
mary of some of the views adopted is given below. 

Dana objected to the retention of the name, thinking it would be 
regarded only as "a reminder of Emmons's blundering work — a suc- 
cession of unstudied assumptions that brought only evil to the science." 
S. W. Ford favored the adoption of the name Taconic for the middle 
portion of the Cambrian, as the term was then used, or that marked by 
the presence of the fossil Olenelhts. Hall felt that it might be well to 
retain the name for those rocks lying below the Potsdam, while C. H. 
Hitchcock considered the lowest Taconic as of lower Potsdam age. 



AMEKICAN GEOLOGY THE TACONIC QUESTION.

Newberry, on the other hand, would retain the name Taconic as a 
group name for one of the minor subdivisions of the Upper Cambrian, 
while Alexander Winchell, from a perusal of the literature only, would 
retain the name for those roeks underlying the Cambrian and retain- 
ing the primordial fauna (JParadosddes). The Canadian geologists, 
Dawson and Selw}n, both regarded the term as useless and unneces- 
sary, while H. S. Williams and Joseph Le Conte recommended that it 
be dropped entirely, owing to the existing conflict of opinion. 

The committee recommended that all the strata lying between the 
Devonian and Archean be divided into three great groups, the Silu- 
rian, Cambrian, and Taconic, the last named to be subdivided as below:

As to the justice of this decision, there may be some question, par- 
ticularly when one recalls the fact that Mr. Walcotfs own studies 
later showed the existence of his Olenellus (Georgian) fauna below 
rather than above the Paradoxides (Acadian) beds. 

When one considers further the condition of the science at the time 
Emmons first proposed the system and the conditions under which he 
labored, without satisfactory maps, it is obviously unfair to hold him 
to as strict an account as would be justifiable with reference to the 
later workers. Even were it true, as stated, that there is to-day "no 
known stratum of rod' in the Taconic range" that is of the geological 
age assigned it by Doctor Emmons/' and even though it were also true 

"Emmons's granular quartz and the lower part of the Stockbridge limestone are 
to-day regarded as older than the Potsdam, as a part of the Lower Cambrian.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



that "all his reasons for calling the Hudson terrane Taconic were 
based on errors of stratigraphy, and it was only a fortunate happening 
that any portion of the upper Taconic rocks occur where he placed 
them in his stratigraphic scheme,'' 1 still there would, to the unpreju- 
diced, seem to be abundant room for the recognition of the name, a fact 
which Mr. Walcott has himself recognized by the adoption of the bor- 
rowed term Ordovician. Moreover, ruling out the term on the ground 
of blundering is scarcely just, since, as Winchell pertinently remarks, 
a similar ruling would take from Columbus the credit of having dis- 
covered America, since he blundered upon it, expecting to strike India. 
The following tables illustrate the three principal stages of the 
Taconic controversy up to 1908, in the columns to the left the subdi- 
visions of Emmons being given, and in those to the right the equiva- 
lents as recognized by Dana and other authorities.

THE S. S. HOWLAND COLLECTION OF BUDDHIST RELIGIOUS 
ART IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



By Immanuel M. Gasanowicz, 
Aid, Division of Historic Archeology. 



The collection was made by Mr. Howland during his travels abroad, 
which extended from Iceland to Burma, and loaned to the Smithsonian 
Institution, by which it was deposited in the United States National 
Museum. Most of the objects were obtained by him from their orig- 
inal possessors. Besides the objects herein described, Mr. Howland's 
deposit includes also several valuable Oriental manuscripts. 

INTRODUCTION. 
THE FOUNDER OF BUDDHISM. . 

Buddhism arose at the end of the sixth or beginning of the fifth 
century B. C. as a schism or reformation of Brahmanism in India. Its 
founder, known by the names of Gautama, Sakyamuni, and Buddha, 
was Siddhartha, son of Suddhodanna, of the family Gautama, rajah, or 
chieftain, of the Sakya clan, who were settled in the Ganges Valley, at 
the foot of the Nepalese Himalayas, about a hundred miles to the 
north of Benares, with Kapilavatsu as capital. 

The simple facts of the founder's career, so far as they can be freed 
from the mass of legends woven about his person, are as follows: 
Siddhartha, who was of a meditative turn of mind and deeply impressed 
with the vanity and misery of life, retired from the world at the age 
of 29, after ten years of married life. This is called the " Great 
Renunciation." For six years he led the life of a recluse, devoting 
himself to the study of the various S}^stems of philosophy and theology 
of the times, and to severe ascetic practices, without finding in either 
a solution of the riddle of existence. In his thirty -fifth year he passed 
through a second mental crisis. While sitting in meditation under 
the famous Bo-tree (a species of Ficus religiosa) at Buddha Gaya, he 
attained to the state of a Buddha— that is, of an "enlightened one," 
or "awakened one 11 — having found the cause of the evils of life and 
the way of deliverance from them.

738 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

For fort3 T -five years Buddha went about from place to place in the 
valley of the Ganges, proclaiming- his good - tidings and gathering 
around him a small band of faithful followers, the earliest members 
of his afterwards famous order. He died peacefully in the midst of 
his disciples in his eightieth year at Kusinagara, the modern Kasia 
in the district of Gorakhpur. 

BUDDHA'S DOCTRINES (DHARMA). 

The substance of the teaching of Buddha is expressed in the "Four 
Noble Truths' 1 : (1) Existence is bound up with sorrow; (2) the causes 
of sorrow are our affections and passions; the craving for life and its 
pleasures, which result in new birth; old age, sickness, and death. For 
the present life of the individual is not the first one. Innumerable 
births have preceded it in previous ages. The attachment to life and 
its pleasures produces a new being, and the moral character of the 
actions of the former existences fixes the condition of the new being. 
This is called the law of cause and effect, or Karma. It is the aggre- 
gate result of all previous acts, in unbroken succession from the 
beginning of existence, which, in the Buddhist conception of man, 
constitutes his character, his real self, his soul, as it were. This alone 
endures when an individual existence has come to an end, tending to 
form, as a kind of transmigration of character, a new sentient being, 
whose nature, condition, and fortune it determines. Individuals are 
merely the present and temporary links in a long chain of cause and 
effect. Each link is the summarized result of the various activities of 
all that have gone before, and is, in its turn, part and parcel of all 
that will follow. By the theory of Karma, Buddhism explains the 
mystery of fate in the apparent unequal distribution here of happiness 
and woe, entirely independent of moral qualities. What a man reaps, 
Buddhism teaches, that he must himself have sown, as whatsoever a 
man sows that shall he also reap. (3) The cessation of sorrow b} r 
suppression of desire and passion; (-1) the way to deliverance by the 
Eightfold Path: (1) Right views, (2) right resolutions, (3) right speech, 
(•f) right conduct, (5) right way of earning a livelihood, (6) right 
endeavor, (7) right thoughts, and (8) right meditation. 

The moral code of Buddhism is comprised in the following ten pro- 
hibitions: (1) Not to kill or even injure any sentient being, (2) not to 
steal, (3) not to commit adultery, (4) not to lie or use an}^ manner of 
improper speech, (5) not to use intoxicating drinks, (6) not to take 
repasts at improper times (i. e., after midday), (7) not to attend dances, 
plays, and public spectacles, (8) not to wear costly raiment and gar- 
lands or use perfumes, (9) not to use large seats and beds, and (10) not 
to receive gold or silver. 

The goal is the Nirvana. In this life a passionless calm, beyond 
reach of temptation, through the extinction of the great passions, such

as lust, hatred, anger, envy, and delusion. By thus uprooting all 
desire, and by perfect detachment from life and its attractions, cessa- 
tion of the renewal of existence will be attained. 

According- to the Buddhist doctrine the historical founder of Bud- 
dhism was Only one of the many Buddhas who appear in this world at 
intervals of many ages, and any one can become a Buddha — that is, 
attain to the way of salvation for himself and others — by practicing 
self-denial and contemplation. 

THE BUDDHIST COMMUNITY (SANGHA). 

The Buddhist community in the strict sense consists of an order of 
monks and nuns (Bhikhshus and Bhikhshunis) who, as a rule, live in 
monasteries and are vowed to celibacy, poverty, and obedience. But 
already in Buddha's lifetime it was found impracticable for all his 
adherents to retire from the world and join the order. On these lay- 
believers only the first five of the ten injunctions quoted above are obli- 
gatory. Among the virtues recommended to the masses are reverence 
of parents and teachers, care for wife and children, submission to 
authority, control over self, patience, forbearance, humility and con- 
tentment, almsgiving, respect for the life of sentient creatures, and 
care for the welfare of all living things. 

Buddha, his doctrine, and the community form the triad of Bud- 
dhism, and the formula of confessing fellowship with -Buddhism is: 
I take my refuge in the Buddha, in the Dharma, and in the Sangha. 

HISTORY OF THE SPREAD OF BUDDHISM. 

Already at the death of Buddha the number of Buddhists seems to 
have been considerable. About the middle of the third century B. C, 
during the reign of Asoka, Buddhism began to spread all over India. 
Towards the end of the eleventh century A. D. it was entirely sup- 
pressed in India itself, the land of its origin. But it had been adopted 
by the kings of Ceylon in the third century B. C. From thence and 
the south of India it w T as carried, in the fifth and seventh centuries 
A. D., to Burma, Siam, and the Javanese archipelago. It entered 
China about 70 A. D. and spread from thence to Korea in the fourth 
century A. D., and to Japan in the sixth century A. D. It is the 
established religion of Nepal and Tibet, and has adherents among the 
Mongols and Kalmucks on the lower Volga and the Buriats of southern 
Siberia. Wherever Buddhism w T ent it was modified by the national 
characteristics and inherited beliefs of its converts, so that its funda- 
mental doctrines w T ere often overshadowed, sometimes destroyed, and 
it developed into strangely inconsistent and even antagonistic beliefs 
and practices. At the same time it everywhere exercised a profound 
influence, both on the moral and religious life of the peoples and on 
their art and architecture. 



740 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Buddhism is divided into two great schools —the southern school in 
Ceylon, Burma, and Siam, called the "Lesser Vehicle'"' (Nmayana), 
which is assumed to have preserved the original teachings of Buddha 
in greater purity and simplicity; and the northern school in central 
and eastern Asia, called the "Greater Vehicle" (Mahay ana), which 
adopted many popular elements of mysticism and magic. Each of 
these schools is subdivided into many sects. 

the collection. 

1. Buddha, standing on the lotus upon a platform, with an 
aureole. — The figure is made of teak, gilded, and studded with col- 
ored stones; the platform is of wood, carved, painted, and gilded, and 
likewise studded with colored stones; the aureole is inlaid with pieces 
of looking-glass, surrounded by a rim of open carved work, terminat- 
ing in a bird, perhaps the Garuda, the mythical bird of India, or the 
sacred goose (hanza). Measurements: Height of the figure, 3 feet 10 
inches; height of the platform, 2 feet 4 inch; width, 3 feet; depth, 3 
feet 6 inches.— Burma. (Plate 1, Cat. No. 216137, U.S.N.M.) 

Buddha is generally represented as a beardless young man. The 
head is surmounted by a protuberance ( Ushmsha), being the "hump of 
perfect wisdom.' 1 The hair is arranged in short curls, resembling sharp 
points, which tradition interprets to represent snails which once came 
out to shelter Buddha's head from the rays of the sun. A precious 
stone in the form of a bead ( Urna) is on the forehead. The ear loin 
are pierced and long, sometimes touching the shoulders. The arn 
are long, which with the Hindus is a mark of noble birth. The robe is 
thrown over the left shoulder, leaving the right one free. He is 
either standing, the attitude of teaching, or sitting with crossed legs, 
meditating, or reclining, passing away into the Nirvana. The throne 
(padmasana) upon which he sits or stands is formed of the fully 
opened lotus tiower, the symbol of purity and perfection. Behind 
the head is often displayed a nimbus or halo, frequently in form 
of a fig leaf, in remembrance of the tree under which he attained to 
Buddhahood. 

2. Buddha, sitting in meditation. — Bronze and inerusted around 
the forehead with colored stones. Height, 2 feet 5 inches. — Burma. 
(Plate 2, Cat. No. 216120, U.S.N.M.) 

3. Buddha, slated upon a lotus. — Carved of teak and gilded 
Height, 3 feet, Burma, (Plate 3, Cat. No. 210131, U.S.N.M.) 

1. Buddha, reclining (passing into Nirvana). — Made of alabaster, 
gilded and inerusted with colored stones. Placed on carved and gilded 
wooden stand. Length of figure, 2 feet 5 inches. Measurements of 
stand: Length, 3 feet; width, 1 foot 8 inches; height, 11 inches. - 
Burma. (Plate 1, Cat. No. 216130, U.S.N.M.) 



ROWLAND COLLECTION OF BUDDHIST ART. 741 

5-7. Three figurines of Buddha, representing- him in the usual 
attitudes: Standing or teaching, sitting in meditation, and reclining, 
or passing into Nirvana. Bronze. The seated figurine is, like No. 2, 
inerusted around the forehead with colored stones. Measurements: 
13 inches, 10£ inches, and 10 inches, respectively. (Plate 5, Cat. Nos. 
216127-216129, U.S.N. M.) 

8. Buddha, seated upon tup: lotus throne, which is supported 
by two lions, the emblem of the Sakya clan, with the nimbus in form 
of a tig leaf in the back, and attended by Bodhisattvas and disciples, 
comprising altogether fifteen figures. Bodhisattvas, in the teaching of 
the northern or Mahyana schools of Buddhism, are preexistent or 
future Buddhas. It is the belief of the Buddhists that these teachers 
of mankind appear upon earth at long intervals and the doctrine which 
they all proclaim is the same. With each there is a period in which 
the doctrine flourishes, then a gradual decline, then it is completely 
overthrown, till a new deliverer appears and once more establishes the 
lost truths. The last Buddha of this age of the world after Gautama 
will be Maitreya, ""the loving one/* The term Bodhisattva is, however, 
often applied to those Buddhist teachers who distinguished themselves 
by learning and piety. The Bodhisattvas are usually represented as 
young men wearing crowns or richly ornamented turbans with a round 
nimbus and decked with bracelets, necklaces, and breast chains. They 
are also often provided with some distinguishing emblem or attribute, 

iuch as a lotus, a sword, a small pagoda, a book, etc., and they ride 
Inimals, as lions, elephants, tigers, etc. Made of wood, lacquered and 
gilded. Inclosed in a black lacquered shrine which is adorned with orna- 
mental bronze clasps and fittings and gilded inside. The doors of the 
shrine on the inside are painted in colors with figures of Nios or tem- 
ple guards, which are sometimes placed on both sides of the first por- 
tal of a Buddhist temple in Japan. The shrine is said to date from 
the sixteenth century A. D. , and to have come from the Vara temple. 
Measurements of the shrine: Height, 2 feet 1 inches; width, 2 feet; 
depth, 1 foot.— Japan. (Plates 6 and 7, Cat. No. 216133, U.S.N. M.) 

9. Buddha, standing in a small pagoda and attended on either 
side by saints seated upon lotuses. The pagoda as well as the lotuses 
are supported by mythical animals, which rest on an elaborately carved 
pedestal. Wood, carved, lacquered, and gilded. Inclosed in a black 
lacquered shrine, the interior of which is gilded. Measurements of 
the shrine: Height, 12^ inches; width, 11 inches; depth, 7i inches.— 
Japan. (Cat. No. 216134, U.S.N.M.)

11. Buddha, seated upon an hexagonal pedestal, holding in his 
left hand the alms bowl. Wood, carved and gilded. Inclosed in a 
black lacquered shrine, the interior of which is gilded. The shrine is 
said to date from the fifteenth century A. D. and to come from the 
Temple of Matsuma at Yamato, Japan. Measurements of the shrine: 
Height, 4^ inches; width, 2 inches; depth, 1 inch. — Japan. Cat. No. 
216136, U.S.N.M.) 

12. Two Buddhist saints (Arhats). — The term arhat, also arahat, 
rahat, arhan, and rahan (Sanskrit, arhant), is applied to those disciples 
and followers of Buddha who have attained the highest degree of per- 
fection and need not be born again; especially to one of the original 
five hundred disciples of Buddha. Buddhist temples usually contain 
numerous images of saints, to whom offerings of flowers, incense, 
candles, etc. , are made. Of teak. Height, 2 feet. — Burma. (Plates. 
Cat. No. 216132, U.S.N.M.) 

13. Two Buddhist monks, holding begging bowls. — Carved on 
teak plaques. Buddhist monks shave their heads and wear a yellow 
robe. They get their living by begging each morning from house to 
house, when they collect rice and fruit enough for the morning and 
midday meal, as their rule forbids them eating after midday. The 
equipment of a Buddhist monk consists of a begging bowl (patra) 
and fruit bag, a rice spoon, a ewer, or water vessel (uda pafra), a 
staff (pinda), a razor, a sewing needle, and a waistband. Measure- 
ments: Height, 2 feet; width, 1 foot 6i inches. — Burma. (Plate i>. 
Cat. No. 216147, U.S.N.M.) 

14. Pair of ornamental begging bowls. — Carved of wood anc 
inlaid with pieces of looking-glass. Measurements: Height, 11^ inches; 
diameter, 16 inches.— Burma. (Plate 10. Cat, No. 216138 U.S.N.M.) 

15. Buddhist sacred book. — Written on palm leaves, which are 
held together between two boards by a cord passed through them. The 
writing is done by means of a sharp stylus, and then ink is rubbed 
over so as to make the markings with the stylus visible. The sacred 
Scriptures of the Buddhists are called the t( Tripitaka " — i. e., three bas- 
kets, because the palm leaves on which they were written were arranged 
in baskets as receptacles. Others explain the term as symbolical of 
the transmission of the teachings of Buddha through a long line of 
teachers and pupils, as baskets are handed on at excavations from 
workman to workman. The sacred language of the southern school is 
Pali; of the northern school, Sanskrit. The Buddhist Scriptures are 
divided into three parts: The Vina/ya ("guidance") contains all that 
relates to the Order of Monks ; the Sutras (" threads " — i . e. , discourse), 
the exposition and elucidation of the doctrines of Buddhism; and the 
Abhidharma (expansion, or enlargement of the doctrine), a detailed 



HOWLAND COLLECTION OF BUDDHIST ART. 748 

discussion of the philosophical basis of the doctrine. Measurements: 
16 inches by 2^ inches by 1^ inches. — Burma. (Plate 11, Cat. No. 
216139, U.S.N.M.) 

16. Prayer wheel. — Consisting of a metal cylinder through which 
passes a wooden handle forming its axis. Around this axis a long strip 
of paper is rolled, inscribed with sacred sentences or invocations. 
A piece of metal fastened by a string to the cylinder facilitates the 
turning of it. Prayer wheels are used especially by the Buddhists of 
Tibet. The most usual invocation inscribed on the rolls in prayer 
wheels consists of the words: "Om! Mani padme ! Hum!" — i. e., O 
jewel in the lotus flower! The lotus, which is otherwise the symbol of 
purity and perfection with Buddhists, is here employed in allusion to 
Avalokiteshvara, or Padmapani, the present Dhyani-Bodhisattva. In 
the theology of the northern school of Buddhism each earthly Buddha 
(Manushi- Buddha) has his mystic or spiritual counterpart, or Dhyani- 
Buddha in one of the heavens or the world of forms. Each of the 
Dhvani Buddhas again has his Dhyani-Bodhisattva, who, after the 
passing away or the Nirvana of the human Buddha, becomes his repre- 
sentative on earth until the appearance of a new Buddha. Padmapani 
is considered as the Dhyani-Bodhisattva of Amitabha, the Dhyani- 
Buddha of Sakhya muni. By the Tibetans he is held in special venera- 
tion as the protector and patron of Tibet. He is believed to have 
appeared on earth from a lotus flower for the deliverance of mankind. 
The Tibetans believe that his descent and incarnation in the Dalai 
Lama, the head of Tibetan Buddhism, takes place by the emission of 
a beam of light. 

Each revolution of the cylinder counts as an uttered prayer, pro- 
vided that the turning is done slowly and from right to left, the latter 
in order to follow the writing which runs from left to right. 

Besides the small hand-prayer wheels, usually measuring from 3 to 
5 inches in height and from 2 to 3 inches in diameter, there are some of 
large size permanently set up near temples and monasteries to be turned 
by each person passing by them; or on gables of houses, or over the 
hearth, where they are twirled by the wind or smoke. Sometimes a 
wheel is fixed to the bed of a stream and kept in motion by the current, 
thus praying night and day for the owner. Measurements: Height, 
2i inches; diameter, 3 inches.— Burma. (Plate 12, Cat. No. 2 Hi Ho, 
U.S.N.M.) 

IT. Pair of temple lamps. — Open fretwork. On the top is the 
receptacle for oil in shape of a dish, from which fig leaves are sus- 
pended. The whole has a kind of aureole as a background and is sur- 
mounted Ijy Ganesa, the Hindu god of sagacity with the elephat head, 
who also found a place in the Tibetan pantheon. Made of bronze. 
Measurements: Height, 3 feet 9 inches; diameter of the base, 13£ 
inches.— Tibet. (Plate 13, Cat. No. 216111, U.S.N.M.) 



744 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

18. Temple drum. — Mounted on a vase-shaped wooden stand carved, 
gilded, and studded with colored stones. Drums or bells are put up in 
front of Buddhist temples, on which the priests strike to announce the 
hours of prayer. The worshipers also strike them to invite the pres- 
ence of the deity. Drums are likewise used in Buddhist worship to 
accompany the chanting of the priests. Measurements: Height, 2 feet 
6 inches; diameters, 14^ and 11 inches. — Burma. (Plate 14^ Cat. No. 
216142, U.S.N.M.) 

19. Howdah, or Saddle of the Sacred White Elephant. — 
Carved of wood, and gilded. The rare white elephant, properly of a 
pale reddish-brown color, with a few white hairs, is considered in East 
India as a sacred animal. Some Buddhists venerate it as an incarna- 
tion of the various Buddhas. Also some Bodhisattvas are represented 
riding elephants. The elephant is also considered an emblem of roy- 
alty, and forms a most imposing feature in every ceremonial procession 
of an Indian potentate. Measurements: Height, 2 feet 8 inches; 
length, 4 feet; width, 2 feet 7 inches.— Burma, (Cat. No. 216148, 
U.S.N.M.) 

20. Cabinet of the King of Burma. — Carved open woodwork, 
gilded and inlaid with pieces of glass. Measurements: Height, 8 feet; 
length, 3 feet 3^ inches; width, 1 foot 11 inches. — Burma. (Cat. No. 
216144, U.S.N.M.) 

21. Saddle of the King of Burma. — Covered with red velvet and 
embroidered in gold. Measurements: Length, 2 feet; width, 1 foot. — 
Burma. (Cat. No. 216146, U.S.N.M.) 

22. Bed of the King of Burma. — Carved open woodwork, gilded 
and inlaid with glass pieces. Measurements: Height, 3 feet 1 inch; 
length, 6 feet 6 inches; width, 3 feet 6 inches. — Burma. (Cat. No. 216145, 
U.S.N.M.) 

23. Wooden carved figure holding gong. — Gongs are used in 
Buddhist worship to make known the presence of the worshiper, and 
also as introductory to prayer. Height, 4 feet. — Burma. (Cat. No. 
216148, U.S.N.M.)

FLINT IMPLEMENTS OF THE FA YUM, EGYPT. 



By Heywood Waltek Seton-Karr, 
Of the British Military Service in Egypt. 



The province of the Fayum, in which the implements described 
below were found, consists of a natural leaf-shape depression, sur- 
rounded by the Libyan Hills, on the west of the Nile, and about fifty 
miles southwest of Cairo. The Bah Yusuf (Joseph's canal) connects 
the Fayum with the valley of the Nile, and in the northwest end of it 
is the Lake Birket-el-Kurun ("Lake of Horns"). In ancient times 
Lake Moeris .filled nearly the whole depression of. the province, and 
the present Birket-el-Kurun is considered by some authorities to be its 
shrunken representative. Here also was the celebrated "•' Labyrinth."" 

The district of the Fayum has yielded a great deal of material for 
archeological and for historical research in the stricter sense in the 
form of papyri and the celebrated Hellenistic encaustic portraits. 

Lake Birket-el-Kurun is salt, and drinking water has to be carried 
to the neighborhood on camels. In ancient times the lake water was 
potable, having been of considerable volume. 

The Arabs near Cairo have for some time been selling flint imple- 
ments of new types from the Fayum; indeed, information came some 
years ago from Schweinfurth, Sayce, Sturge, and Evans that they had 
been found there in small numbers. Latterly H. J. Beadnell published 
a short paper " with map and plates. The map was important as show- 
ing roughly the supposed limits of the water. An outline is annexed, 
based on Beadnell's map, with slight additions regarding implement- 
iferous localities and the ancient border. The implements occur over 
most parts of the surface above the ancient water level and where the 
prevailing north wind removes the sand — such as the crests of undula- 
tions. For, in some parts the hardened cla} T of the lake bottom is 
barred with lines of small sand waves having clear spaces between; 
stones and implements are on the bare parts, and few, if any, under 
the sand. They appear to prevent the sand from settling. There 
is practically nothing on the old lake floor, even where the deposit has 
been weathered away to the bed-rock, excepting around the border.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 



About the year 2200 B. C. Amenemhat I began to bring the peri- 
odical inflow from high Nile under control. It' a natural lake existed 
long before, having broken in through the gap during some great 
flood, its level also must have varied, not only by evaporation but 
during cycles of low Nile, and also no water might have entered the 
oasis for years in succession. 

The nodules of flint that occur all over this desert are of a tough 
consistency, small, and very suitable for making arrow points and the 
distinctive and peculiar Fayum implements. This may be the reason 
why only two "coups-de-poing," or "drift" implements of Chelleen 
or Acheuleen type were found.

BIRKET EL KURUN 



Ma i' of Fayum Desert. 

The dotted line shows approximately the shore of the ancient hike; F !•', implementiferons spots; 
R, ruins of Qasr el Sagha. 

The implements from the Hint mines in the Eastern Desert are of a 
cherty material, which occurs in masses and nodules of such shape and 
consistency as to be suitable for making them, and they are found 
only in that vicinity. Examples may now be seen in most of the 
museums on the four continents from both these localities, as also of 
those discovered by the writer in Somaliland. It is indeed probable 
that peculiar types discovered in different parts of the world have 
been evolved through the local material. For example, in the paleo- 
lithic workshops in the Madras Province of India, which I discovered 



FLINT IMPLEMENTS OF THE FAYUM. 749 

with the help of Mr. Bruce Foote and Mr. Macleod, the material in 
the shape of quartzite nodules is suitable for that type of implement. 
Specimens of these also are now to be seen in nearly all museums. 
At Banda (United Provinces of India) were procured numbers of 
polished axes set up in shrines, etc. 

Besides the implements shown in the accompanying plates, there 
were found in the Fayum disks about 10 centimeters in diameter, and 
scrapers, the paleolithic " racloir" of de Mortillet's LePrehistorique." 

The implements here figured are soon likely to become dispersed by 
presentation among different museums. The number discovered was 
very large, as areas of surface were laid off systematically and many 
Arabs were employed. They are remarkably quick at finding small 
objects in the sand. The selection is therefore more or less repre- 
sentative. 

There are also two types not figured and peculiar to the Fayum, 
all the specimens of both series having been presented to the Cairo 
Museum. 

The first is an unsightly, irregularly shaped, flat knife, pointed at 
both ends, rather rough, and with concave angles for fish-scaling. 
Not uncommon. 

The second is a flat knife of a round and sometimes of an oval shape, 
but having somewhere in its circumference a well-marked, carefully 
worked, re-entrant angle or concave edge. The shape varies so much 
that a complete representative series would be out of the question. 
Figs. 124, 125, 127, 128, 129, partly resemble them. 

Many of the implements figured resemble some of de Mortillet's 
and are classified as later paleoliths of the Solutreen epoch, corre- 
sponding to the Laugerie-Haute epoch of Evans — the apogee in the 
making of stone implements, as de Mortillet remarks. The color of 
the material varies greatly.

DESCRIPTION OF PLATES. 

Plate 1. 

Thin knives, some of unusual narrowness, finely worked by compression on both 
sides. Xos. 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 have for their liases the natural outside of the stone; No. 10 
is beautifully flaked by compression. 



"Edition of 1900, p. 170. 



750 EEPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1904. 

Plate 2. 

Arrowheads, many of new anu nitherto unknown types. Nearly all are exquis- 
itely worked along the edges. No. 27 was found with 19 similar ones in a heap, 
partly covered by blown sand and may be the contents of the same quiver. Nos. 27,- 
28, 29 are about one-fourth inch in thickness, and are of a light pink color. 

Plate 3. 

Further types of arrows of unusually large size and varied shapes. Some resem- 
ble examples from Ireland. 

Plate 4. 

Nos. 97 to 107 are additional types of arrows. No. 107 must he compared with the 
Solutreen javelin heads or " Pointes a cran " figured in Le Prehistoric pie (p. 181) 
and with those in Plates 7 and 8. Nos. 108 and 109 are of crystal, the only examples 
not included in my discovery. They are in the Cairo Museum. 

Plate 5. 

Nos. 112, 114, L16j 117, 120 are flat on the underside and show the conchoidal frac- 
ture or bulb of percussion. The rest are worked on both sides; having a natural 
butt end, however, they might resemble de Mortillet's Mousterian or middle-paleo- 
lithic pointes a mam (p. 163). 

Plate 6. 

No. 122 is one of a large number of bent flakes, polished and worked to a scraping 
edge on one side and peculiar to the Fayum. Nos. 123, 125, 126 another Fayum 
type. They resemble adze blades for working wood and hollowing out trees for 
canoes. Nos. 124, 125, 127, 128, 129 are knives with a cutting edge all round and an 
angle for scraping "grattoirs concaves." No. 130 exactly resembles de Mortillet's 
"double grattoir Solutreen" in the Musee de Saint Germain. These are not exclu- 
sively paleolithic. Evans figures one from Bridlington. No. 131 is one of two 
implements found which resemble a gravel-drift paleolith. 

Plate 7. 

These implements resemble the "pointes en feuille de laurier" figured in Le Pre- 
historique on pages 181, 627, and 029. They belong to the later paleoliths or Solu- 
treen epoch. These forms drift insensibly into the "Pointes en feuille de saule" 
and "pointes a. cran" of the same epoch. Nos. 159 and 160 resemble the remarkable 
crescent-shaped implements on Plate 8, hut are straight. 

Plate 8. 

Nos. 172, 173, large crescent-snaped "pointes a cran," use unknown. No. 178 is a 
"lame pointue." Nos. 174 to 183 are peculiar Fayum arrowheads or javelin heads 
called "pointes a cran" and are somewhat waterworn and polished by friction and 
use. No. 184 in Plate 8 to 198 on Plate. 9 are saws, now thought by M . Maspero and 
others to have been fixed in wooden handles like a sickle. Some are not toothed, 
and No. 191 is a rare form. No. 182 is a saw, not toothed, hut probably equally 
effective. 

Plate 9. 

Figures 194 to 198 are the continuation of the series of saws snown on Plate 8. 
No. 198 strongly resembles the implement on Plate 11 (No. 246), but the latter is very 
carefully worked and not toothed. Nos. 199 and 200 are implements purchased 
from Arabs and were apparently reworked by them to present a more salable appear- 



flint implements of the fayum. 751 

ance. The patination, which is sometimes extraordinary, proves their antiquity. 
Nos. 201 to 213, whether arrow or javelin heads, are of rare, varied, and practically 
unfamiliar types. No. 214 is unique. 

Plate 10. 

These are large and remarkahle forms of arrows. 

Plate 11. 

Nos. 237 and 238 are rare form , of which one example was found and figured by 
Beadnell. No. 239 is unique and is perhaps a "grattoir," combined with a borer, 
like the "poincon Solutreen," Nos. 243, 244, 245 are butt ends of similar ones. Nos. 
241 and 242 are somewhat similar to each other, and have therefore been placed 
together. They were probably used for boring wood, as the cutting edge is worked 
only on one side. No. 240 has the concave part at the end very carefully worked. 
Nos. 246 and 249 are flakes beautifully worked into knives. Larger examples of 
these, struck off as a single flake from the block and delicately serrated, are shown 
in the Cairo Museum. No. 250 is a knife with rounded ends. 

Plate 12. 

An example of No. 251 was found and figured by Beadnell in the publication 
previously referred to. No. 252 is a portion of a long serrated spearhead. No. 253 
consists of parts of an armlet, similar to those discovered in Wadi esh-Sheikh, and 
figured in the Liverpool Museum Bulletin, as well as in Read's Guide to the Stone 
Age, published by the British Museum. Another example may be found in the 
Cairo Museum. No. 256 is a spearhead, finely worked in purple flint with white 
patinations. No. 257 is the same. No. 258 resembles the implements on Plate 11, 
but is flat on the underside, as also is No. 254. No. 259 was picked up under a large 
rock by a Berber boy. M. Maspero says that these are now regarded as sacrificial 
knives, and they are so labeled in the Cairo Museum. The serrations pointing for- 
ward to keep the handle in place, are especially to be noted.
