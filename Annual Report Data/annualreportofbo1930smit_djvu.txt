REPORT 

OF THK 

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN 

INSTITUTION 

C. G. Abbot 

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1930 

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution: 

Gextlemex : I have the honor to submit herewith my report show- 
ing the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution and 
the Government bureaus under its administrative charge during the 
fiscal year ended June 30. 1930. The first 24 pages contain a summary 
account of the affairs of the Institution. Appendixes 1 to 11 give 
more detailed reports of the operations of the United States National 
Museum, the National Gallery of Art, the Freer Gallery of Art, the 
Bureau of American Ethnology, the International Exchanges, the 
National Zoological Park, the Astrophysical Observatory, the Divi- 
sion of Radiation and Organisms, the United States Regional Bureau 
of the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, the Smith- 
sonian library, and of the publications issued under the direction of 
the Institution: and Appendix 12 contains a list of subscribers since 
November 15, 1929, to the James Smithson Memorial Edition of the 
Smithsonian Scientific Series. 

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION 

OUTSTANDING EVENTS OF THE YEAR 

Several events of unusual importance to the Institution have oc- 
curred during the year just passed, and its scientific work has pro- 
gressed in a satisfactory manner. To mention some of the high-lights 
of the year's advance. Congress authorized an appropriation for the 
construction of the much-needed wings on the Natural History 
Building of the National Museum at a cost not to exceed $G,500,000. 
The work of the Astrophysical Observatory has shown an apparently 
large and important influence of small short-period solar variations 
on the temperature in the United States. The new Division of Radia- 

X 



2 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 

tion and Organisms has made rapid progress in the construction and 
equipment of laboratories for physical, chemical, and biological 
investigations, and has already obtained preliminary results in two 
highly interesting researches. Dr. E. H. Goddard, whose experi- 
ments in designing and building a rocket to explore the unknown 
upper layers of the atmosphere the Institution has aided for 12 
years, brought the work to the point of practical demonstration. 
The late Simon Guggenheim, at Colonel Lindbergh's suggestion, has 
made a large grant to complete this development under most favor- 
able auspices. Dr. C. U. Clark, under a grant from Ambassador 
Charles G. Dawes, has made important discoveries of unpublished 
early Spanish-American records in European archives. Four more 
volumes of the Smithsonian Scientific Series were practically ready 
to be issued at the close of the year, making eight volumes completed, 
and the last four are well advanced in preparation. Substantial 
sums have already been received by the institution as royalties on 
the sale of this series. The fifth and sixth awards of the Langley 
Gold Medal for Aerodromics were made to Charles Matthews Manly 
and Commander (now Admiral) Richard Evelyn Byrd. Under the 
auspices of the Institution and its branches many expeditions went 
into the field to obtain necessary data and collections. Reference 
to these will be found in the following reports. Many monographs 
and smaller papers embodying the results of original researches have 
been published and widely distributed throughout the world. 

THE ESTABLISHMENT 

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of Eng- 
land, who, in 1826, bequeathed his property to the United States of 
America " to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of 
knowledge among men." In receiving the property and accepting 
the trust, Congress determined that the Federal Government was 
without authority to administer the trust directly, and therefore 
constituted an " establishment " whose statutory members are " the 
President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of 
the executive departments." 

THE BOARD OF REGENTS 

The affairs of the Institution are administered by a Board of 
Regents whose membership consists of "the Vice President, the 
Chief Justice, three members of the Senate, and three Members of 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 3 

the House of Representatives, to<^etlier with six other persons other 
than Members of Con^aess, two of whom shall be resident in the 
city of Washington and tlie other four shall be inhabitants of some 
State, but no two of them the same State." One of the Regents is 
elected chancellor by the board; in the past the selection has fallen 
upon the Vice President or the Chief Justice; and a suitable person 
is chosen by the Regents as Secretar}' of the Institution, wlio is also 
secretary of the Board of Regents, and the executive ollicer directly 
in charge of the Institution's activities. 

The only change occurring in the personnel of the board during 
the year was the resignation of Cliief Justice Taft and his succession 
by Charles Evans Hughes, both as Chief Justice and as Chancellor 
of the Board of Regents, 

The roll of the Regents at the close of the fiscal year was as fol- 
lows: Charles Evans Hughes, Chief Justice of the United States, 
chancellor; Charles Curtis, Vice President of the United States; mem- 
bers from the Senate, Reed Smoot, Joseph T. Robinson, Claude A. 
Swanson ; members from the House of Representatives, Albert John- 
son, R. Walton Moore, Robert Luce; citizen members, Robert S. 
Brookings, Missouri; Irwin B. Lauglilin, Pennsylvania; Frederic 
A. Delano, Washington, D. C. ; Dwight W. Morrow, New Jersey; 
and John C. Merriam, Washington, D. C.

lowing:

MATTERS OF GENERAL INTEREST 



AWARD OF LANOLET MEDAL TO CHARLES MATTHEWS MANLY AND TO 
COMMANDER RICHARD EVELYN BYRD, UNITED STATES NA\'Y 

The fifth and sixth awards of the Langley Gold Medal for Aero- 
dromics to Charles Matthews Manly (posthumously) and to Com- 
mander (now Admiral) Richard Evelyn Byrd, United States Navy, 
were made at the Annual Meeting of the Board of Regents of the 
Institution on December 12, 1929. The medal had been hitherto 
awarded four times, to Wilbur and Orville "Wright, to Glenn H. 
Curti.ss, to Gustave EilFel, and to Charles A. Liiidltergli. The award 



8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

to Mr. Manly was made in recognition of his pioneer contributions 
to the development of the airplane engine, and that to Commander 
Byrd for his pioneer flights over the North and South Poles, his non- 
stop flight over the Atlantic Ocean, and the scientific discoveries 
associated with these flights. 

The posthumous award to Mr. Manly will be presented through 
the person of his son. Commander Byrd was notified of the award 
to him by radiogram to Little America, Antarctica. The actual 
presentation of the two gold medals had not been made at the close 
of the year. 

ADDITIONS TO THE NATURAL HISTORY BUILDING OF THE NATIONAL 

MUSEUM 

An event of capital importance to the future of the Smithsonian 
and the National Museum occurred on June 19, 1930, when Congress 
passed the following bill : 

Be it enacted hij the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States 
of A}nerica in Congress assembled. That the Smithsonian Institution is herebj' 
authorized to extend the Natural History Building of the United States National 
Museum by additions on the east and west ends thereof, in accordance with 
plans to be approved by the Commission of Fine Arts, and to engage, if neces- 
sary, architectural and inspection services, without regard to the restrictions 
of existing law governing such services. There is hereby authorized to be 
appropriated a sum not exceeding $6,500,000 for this purpose. 

The present Natural History Building has for years been over- 
crowded, both as to exhibition halls and to laboratories and storage 
rooms. The additions authorized by Congress, which will approxi- 
mately double the present floor space, will not only permit of a more 
satisfactory arrangement of exhibits for the benefit of the more than 
one million visitors every year, but also will provide additional facili- 
ties for the growing research work of the Museum staff. 

The bill quoted above is only an authorization and does not carry 
an actual appropriation. Plans have not yet been prepared, but in 
general the additions will conform in style and general arrangement 
with the present structure. 

RESEARCHES IN EUROPEAN ARCHIVES 

Early in 1929 Ambassador Charles G. Dawes provided the Institu- 
tion with a fund for the purpose of conducting researches among 
European archives in search of documents relating to the early 
history and ethnology of middle America. In April, 1929, Dr. C. U. 
Clark was appointed by the Smithsonian to conduct this mission, and 
early in October Doctor Clark began his work in Europe, Since that 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 9 

time he has studied dili<j:ently at several of the principal archives 
containing early American material and has discovered a consider- 
able number of valuable early manuscripts hitherto unpublished. 
In addition to the titles listed below Doctor Clark has excerpted 
many hundreds of pages of interesting ethnological material relating 
to the Americas from manuscripts which were not of special interest 
in their complete form, such as reports, letters, etc. The manuscripts 
copied and prepared for publication are as follows :

ROCKKT EXPERIMENTS OF DR. R. H. OODD.MJD 

For the past 12 years the Institution has supported by annual 
grants the researches of Dr. R. H. Goddard, of Clark University, on 
the development of a rocket to explore the upper atmosphere. In 
191 G Doctor Goddard presented to the Institution such a convincing 
mathematical demonstration of the theory that a self-propelling 
rocket could be sent to the limit of the earth's atmosphere, and even 
beyond, that Doctor Walcott, then Secretary of the Smithsonian, 
after consultation witli a committee of experts, agreed to support the 
investigation. The work progressed so favorably that the Institu- 
tion has continued its support until tlie present time. 



10 ANNUAL, REPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

The highest level of the air which can now be studied is about 
20 miles up, reached by sounding balloons, but these balloons often 
drift as much as 150 miles from their starting point, and their 
recovery is slow and uncertain. A rocket, on the other hand, would 
go straight up to any desired height and provided with a parachute 
would return in a short time at or very near its starting point. With 
suitable automatic apparatus, such a rocket could bring back samples 
of the upper air for chemical analysis, measure the temperature and 
pressure of the higher atmosphere, expose spectographs above the 
ozone layer where the ultra-violet spectrum of the sun could be 
observed, and record the condition of the atmosphere from 5,000 feet 
upward in the interests of aviation. In short, a whole new field of 
investigation would be opened up — ^the unknown upper layers of the 
earth's atmosphere. 

This investigation was pioneering in character; little was avail- 
able as a guide. After much experimenting with a rocket equipped 
with a device for feeding small charges of high explosive, Doctor 
Goddard turned finally to the scheme of a steady combustion of 
hydrocarbon in liquid, oxygen. After further modifying the design 
of the rocket itself to adapt it to the use of this new means of 
propulsion. Doctor Goddard was ready at the close of the fiscal 
year for an actual field trial of the device. 

It may be said that on July 17, 1929, a trial of the liquid-pro- 
pelled rocket was made at Worcester, Mass., the device functioning 
satisfactorily as regards the flow of liquid, the ascent of the rocket, 
and its rapid motion in air. The trial rocket was guided only 
by vanes on its rear end, and these proved inefiicient, the rocket 
describing a high arch and returning to the ground instead of 
making a vertical flight. Doctor Goddard has already designed 
automatic stabilizers, however, and these together with the neces- 
sary automatic recording devices are seemingly all that is needed 
to insure a successful, practical flight of the rocket to the higher 
layers of the atmosphere and its return with the first records of an 
unknown region. 

The apparently assured success of Doctor Goddard's experiments 
has drawn support from a source better equipped financially to 
provide it than the Smithsonian. The late Simon Guggenheim at 
Colonel Lindbergh's suggestion made a large grant of funds and 
set up an advisory committee of which the secretar}^, Doctor Abbot, 
is a member. Doctor Goddard's experiments are now going on under 
these auspices in New Mexico. It is a pleasure to record here that 
the Smithsonian has again been able to support during its more or 
less uncertain pioneering stages an investigation of great promise 
for the increase of knowledge. 



REPORT OP THE SECRETARY 11 

LOW TEMPERATURE RESEARCHES 

The Smithsoniun has made two small grants during the year 
to Prof. Dr. W. H. Keesom, director of the Cyrogenic Laboratory 
at Leiden, in aid of his important researches on the properties 
of matter at very low temperatures. Two investigations were in 
progress by Doctor Keesom, with the aid of his collaborators, namely, 
the measurement of the specific heat of gases at very low tempera- 
tures, and the measurement of the thermomolecular pressure differ- 
ences at very low temperatures. 

In connection with the lirst, it seemed desirable to obtain measure- 
ments on the specific heat of helium gas at the temperatures obtain- 
able with liquid helium. Such a measurement had already been 
made by Meissner in Berlin, who found the specific heat of helium 
gas at a temperature of 5.5° K. (approximately —450° F.) and a 
pressure of 0.75 atmosphere to be about 65 per cent of the normal 
value, and ascribed this result to quantum effects. There is reason 
to doubt, however, whether quantum effects can be demonstrated in 
such a way because of the influence of intermolecular forces on 
specific heat. To investigate this matter. Doctor Keesom and his 
assistants elaborated a method of measuring the velocity of propaga- 
tion of sound at these very low temperatures and at pressures smaller 
than 1 atmosphere. From this velocity, the specific heat may be 
derived. 

Measurements of this velocity have already been made with great 
accuracy at the temperatures of liquid oxygen and of liquid h3'dro- 
gen, and preliminary measurements have been made of the velocity 
of sound in helium gas at the temperature of liquid helium, but 
further developments in the method must be made for this last 
investigation. 

Doctor Keesom's second research relates to the investigation of 
the thermomolecular pressure differences between the bulb of the 
helium thermometer and the manometer used in the measurement of 
the lowest temperatures obtainable. In his latest measurements the 
temperature recorded was 0.89° K. (approximately, =458° F.). Ex- 
act measurements of these pressure differences have now been made 
at the temperatures of boiling oxygen and of boiling hydrogen; 
measurements at the temperatures obtainable with liquid helium will 
follow. 

DIVISION OF RADIATION AND ORGANISMS 

The report of the director on the first year's work of this new 
and impoitant branch of the Smithsonian's investigations in physical 
science shows remarkably rapid progress. The construction of labo- 
ratories and their equipment has been particularly difficult because 



12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

of the borderline character of the researches ; it was necessary to 
provide for physical, chemical, and biological fields of investigation. 
In spite of the constant construction and equipment problems, actual 
research work was started, and two experiments, the one on photo- 
tropism, the other on infra-red absorption of pure chemicals, were 
carried to interesting preliminary results. 

Offices for the division Avere provided by remodelling the hitherto 
unused flag tower of the Smithsonian Building, and space in the 
basement previously used for storage was reconstructed into a mod- 
ern ph3'sical, chemical, and biological laboratory. A small group of 
highly trained specialists has been assembled to carry on the inves- 
tigations, and these men work in close cooperation with the Smith- 
sonian Astrophysical Observatory, the Fixed Nitrogen Laboratory of 
the Agricultural Department, the "University of Maryland, and the 
Research Corporation of New York. 

The chief aim of the division is to build up a strong spectro- 
jihotometric laboratory, whose staff of physicists and technicians 
will work in cooperation with men of biological training. The re- 
searches to be undertaken fall into two classes: (1) Direct investiga- 
tion ujDon living organisms, and (2) fundamental molecular struc- 
ture and photochemical investigations related to the biological 
problems. In connection with the first, an experiment was made 
to determine the amount of bending of plants towards light of var- 
ious wave lengths. Briefly, the experiment showed that red or infra- 
red light produced no effect ; that yellow light produced a small but 
measurable bending; that green light was 1,000 times more effective 
than yellow; and that blue light was 30 times more effective than 
green, or 30,000 times more effective than yellow. These results are 
so interesting that preparations are under way for a more elaborate 
experiment. 

Under the second heading above, no work could be undertaken 
at the Smithsonian because of lack of funds and shop equipment. 
Some progress Avas made, hoAvever, in the preparation of equipment, 
and through the cooperation of the Fixed Nitrogen Laboratory, Mr. 
Liddell of its staff continued an investigation begun there by Doctor 
Brackett before his appointment by the Smithsonian. This project, 
which was completed as far as the equipment permitted, involved 
the study of the near infra-red absorption spectra of the halogen 
deviations of benzene. 

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK 

Expeditions in the field are essential to the Smithsonian's work 
in anthropology, biology, geology, and astrophysics. Twenty-eight 
major expeditions went out during the year to widely scattered 
regions, bringing back necessary information and valuable speci- 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 13 

mens. The Institution boro llio ontiro expense of a few of tliese 
expeditions. For the cost of the others, in part at least, it is indebted 
to friends of the Smithsonian or to other institutions equally 
interested in the proposed work. 

The ref]^ions visited by the year's field expeditions included China, 
Alaska, Canada, the West Indies, South America, Africa, Europe, 
the Philippines, and Siam, as well as 13 localities in the United 
States. I may mention especially Assistant Secretary Dr. A. 
Wetmore's bird collectinp^ expedition in Spain, Dr. Paul Bartsch'.s 
explorations for mollusks in the West Indies under the Walter 
Kathbone Bacon Travelling Scholarship; anthropological studies in 
Alaska by Dr. Ales Hrdlicka and Mr. Henry B. Collins, jr.; an 
extended botanical exploring trip in Amazonian Peru and Brazil, 
by Mr. Ellsworth P. Killip; and three separate expeditions to the 
island of Santo Domingo, namely, Mr. E. C. Leonard's botanical 
exploration of northwestern Haiti, Mr. Herbert W. Krieger's archeo- 
logical work in the Dominican Republic, and Mr. Arthur J. Poole's 
explorations in Haitian caves. 

Brief accounts of all of these expeditions, fully illustrated, 
appeared in " Explorations and Field-Work of the Smithsonian 
Institution in 1929," Smithsonian Publication No. 3060, and notices 
of some of them will be found in the reports of certain of the bureaus 
under the Institution's direction, appended hereto. 

COOPERATIVE ETHNOLOGICAL AND ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS 

In 1928 Congress authorized the appropriation of $20,000 for 
cooperative ethnological and archeological investigations in the 
several States. The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution was 
designated to approve the investigations proposed, and if found 
desirable, to allot from the money appropriated a sum equal to that 
raised for the purpose by any State educational institution, or 
scientific organization in the United States. He was named also 
to direct the work and to divide the results thereof. Fifteen allot- 
ments for approved investigations have been made during the year, 
as follows : 

Allotments from the fund for cooperative ethnojogicdl and areheological invcuti- 
gations during the fiscal year ended June 30, lOSO

tive project for the study and preservation of the Indian material 
and data in the various States. 

PUBLICATIONS 

The publications of the Institution are issued in 11 distinct series, 
which total approximately 10,000 pages a year. The Institution 
proper publishes three of the series, namely, Smithsonian Annual Re- 
ports, Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, and Smithsonian 
Miscellaneous Collections ; the other series are issued by the bureaus 
under Smithsonian direction. The Contributions to Knowledge, in 
quarto, which for many years was the best Icnown of all of the series, 
has in recent years been suspended because the higher costs of print- 
ing made it impracticable to issue monographs in the more expen- 
sive quarto form. The Institution expects however to resume the 
Contributions when more resources become available. 

A total of 95 volumes and pamphlets appeared during the year, 
and 168,163 copies of Smithsonian publications were distributed, 
including 19,575 volumes and separates of the Smithsonian Miscel- 
laneous Collections, 29,886 volumes and separates of the Smithso- 
nian Annual Reports, 4,598 Smithsonian special publications, 87.323 
publications of the National Museum and 24,868 publications of the 
Bureau of American Ethnology. Titles and authors and other in- 
formation regarding the year's publications are given in the report 
of the editor, appendix 11. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 15 

The Annual Report of tlio Boai\l of Refjjents to Congress con- 
tained the usual General Appendix made up of articles in semipopular 
style to present the progress in nearly all branches of science during 
the year. These reports continue in wide demand, and many letters 
are received expressiiin: appreciation of the Institution's efforts to 
give the nontechnical reader an authentic survey of the yearly 
advance along the scientific front. 

SMITHSONIAN SCIENTIFIC SERIES 

As stated in my last report, the Institution decided in 1928 to 
issue a popular, profusely illustrated series of 12 volumes relating 
to the several branches of science coming within the scope of its 
activities, with the expectation that through the sale of this series, 
increased resources might become available for the furtherance of 
its scientific work. The sale of the books, known as the Smith- 
sonian Scientific Series, is entirely in the hands of the New York 
publishers, the Smithsonian's part being only that of author. 

Volumes one to four appeared in 1929, as follows: 

1. The Sniithsoiiian Institution, by Webster Prentiss True. 

2. The Sun and the Welfare of Man, by Charles Greeley Abbot. 

3. MineraLs from Earth and Sky. Part I, The Story of Meteorites, by George 

P. Morrill ; Part II, Gems and Gem Minerals, by William F. Foshas. 

4. The North American Indians. An account of the American Indians north of 

Mexico, compiled from the original sources, by Rose A. Palmer. 

Volumes five to eight were still in press at the close of the fiscal 
year, but were expected to be received from the printer very soon 
thereafter. They are as follows : 

5. Insects: Tlieir Ways and Means of Living, by R. E. Snodgrass. 
(5. Wild Animals in and out of the Zoo, by William M. Mann. 

7. Man from the Farthest Past, by C. W. Bishop, C. G. Abbot, and A. HrdliCka. 

8. Cold-Blooded Vertebrates, by C. W. Gilmore, D. M. Cochran, and S. F. 

Hildebraiid. 

The remaining four volumes are in press or in an advanced state 
of preparation, and will be issued during the coming year. 

LIBRARY 

The Smithsonian library is composed of 10 divisional and 3G sec- 
tional libraries. The divisional libraries include the Smithsonian 
deposit in the Library of Congress, which is the Institution's main 
library, the office library, the Langley Aeronautical Library, and the 
seven libraries of the bureaus under administrative direction of the 
Institution, the largest of which is the National Museum library. 
This last includes the 3G sectional libraries, which are the working 
units kept in the various divisions of the Museum. The whole library 
immbers over 800,000 volumes, pamphlets, and charts. The year's 
accessions totaled 14,277 iteuis, of which 7,979 were vohnnes and 0,298 
were pamphlets and charts. 



16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

All important change during the year was the removal of the 
Langley Aeronautical Library from the Smithsonian Building to the 
Library of Congress, where although still remaining a unit of the 
Smithsonian library, it will be more centrally available to the stu- 
dent. Many gifts were received during the year, among which may 
be mentioned a collection of 1,400 volumes on various subjects from 
Mr. James Townsend llussell, jr.; 150 volumes and 1,000 periodicals 
chiefly on aeronautics from the National Aeronautic Association; 
and 58 volumes on Japanese history and literature from the Histori- 
ographical Institute, Tokyo. 

Further progress was made on the union catalogue, but this large 
task will require many years for completion unless additional assist- 
ants are provided. The congested condition of the Museum library 
was relieved for the time being by the installation of 400 feet of new 
shelving. 

The librarian notes that although two additional assistants are 
provided for in the coming year, six more are needed to enable the 
libraiy to render the desired service to the work of the Institution. 

GOVEKNMENTALLY SUPPORTED BRANCHES 

NATIONAL MUSEUM 

The event of the year for the Museum was the i)assage of the 
Smoot-Elliott bill authorizing an appropriation for the extension 
of the Natural History Building by the construction of wings at 
the east and west ends at a cost of $6,500,000. These additions, 
which will follow the style and general arrangement of the present 
building, will relieve the greatly overcrowded condition of the offices 
and exhibition halls, and also will permit of normal expansion of 
the national collections which are the foundation for researches in 
pure science and consequently for their application to the welfare of 
mankind. 

The appropriations for the maintenance of the Museum for the 
3'ear totaled $762,514, an increase of $14,490, of which $9,500 pro- 
vided for salaries of five additional positions, namely an assistant 
curator of moUusks, an additional clerk in the administrative office, 
and three sergeants of the watch. These additions to the personnel 
were of great benefit to the Museum's work, but several offices are 
still undermanned, both as to scientific and clerical workers. 

Additions to the collections during the year totaled 410,815 speci- 
mens, the majority coming to the department of biology. Material 
sent in for expert examination and report numbered 1,306 lots, and 
gifts of duplicate material to schools totaled 11,474 specimens. Ex- 
changes to the number of 12,649 specimens were sent out, and 33,208 
were loaned to scientific workers outside of Washington. 



REPORT OF TllK SECRETARY 17 

Large collections of material representing the Indian and Eskimo 
tribes of Alaska came to (lie department of anthropology through 
the field work there by Di-. Ales Ilrdlicka and :^^r. Henry B. Col- 
lins, jr. There may also be mentioned an ethnological collection 
from Nigeria and the gold and ivory coasts of Africa, from Mr. 
C. C. Roberts; prayer stones and other objects of a religious nature 
from Tibet, presented by Mr. Charles S. Isham; and ethnological 
material from the Dominican Republic collected by Mr. II. W. 
Krieger. 

Among tlie great amount of material received by the department 
of biology there stand out extensive collections given by the Na- 
tional Geographic Society, including birds and plants brought from 
western China by Dr. Joseph F. Rock and insects and plants from 
northern Brazil collected by Mr. E. G. Holt; further general natural 
history collections made in China by the Rev. D. C. Graham; bi- 
ological material from Siani from Dr. Hugh M. Smith; and a very 
complete series of birds' eggs from Mr. A. C. Bent. 

The most important single object received by the department of 
geology was tlie great flawless crj'stal ball 12% inches in diameter 
presented by Mrs. Worcester Reed Warner as a memorial to her 
husband. Through the income of the Roebling fund and of the 
Frances Lea Chamberlain fund, a considerable number of fine min- 
eral specimens and gem stones were added to tlie collections. 
Through the field work of Resser, Gilmore, Gidley, and others of 
the Museum stuff, large and valuable collections of fossils have been 
added. 

Many interesting accessions came to the arts and industries de- 
partment, prominent among them being the gift by Mr. Rudolph 
Eickemeyer of a large series of examples of his own work in pic- 
torial photographj', together with a library of works on photography. 
Mr. Eickemeyer has provided in his will a fund for the care of the 
collection. The division of history received among other historical 
material five pieces of china used in the White House by President 
James Madison, presented by Miss Mary M. McGuire, and a gown 
worn by Mrs. Calvin Coolidge presented for the costume collection 
by Mrs. Coolidge. 

A large number of field expeditions went out under the direction 
of members of the Museum staff, financed chiefly by the private 
income of the Smithsonian Institution or through the aid of inter- 
ested friends and i)atrons. These expeditions are described briefly 
in the report of the National Museum, Appendix 1. 

The lecture rooms and auditorium of the ^Museum were used by 
Government and other agencies for hearings, meetings, and lectures 
to the number of 13."). Visitors to the Museum totalled 1.894,989 for 
the year. Sixteen volumes and 35 pamphlets were published, and 
87,323 copies of Mu.seum j)uhlications were distiibuted. 



18 ANNUAL REPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART 

The leading event of the year was the exhibition in the gallery of 
the 78 American paintings purchased during the last 10 years from 
the Ranger fund, which are subject to consideration as additions to 
the gallery's permanent collections as provided in the Ranger be- 
quest. The paintings were lent for the exhibition by the institu- 
tions to which they were assigned by the National Academy of De- 
sign. The exhibition was opened on December 10, 1929, with a 
reception by the Secretary and Regents of the Institution, the Director 
of the National Gallery, and the members of the National Gallery 
of Art Commission; the National Academy of Design was repre- 
sented by six of its officials. 

Besides the exhibition of Ranger paintings, four special exhibits 
were held during the year, namely, sculpture of Edgardo Simone, 
portraits by Edwin B. Child, paintings, sculptures, etc., by contem- 
porary Hungarian artists, and paintings by American Negro artists. 

FREER GALLERY OF ART * 

Additions to the collections by purchase during the year include 
examples of early Egyptian bookbinding; Chinese bronzes; Chinese 
jade objects; Persian and Egyptian manuscripts; Persian, Indian, 
Chinese, and Egyptian paintings; Chinese porcelain bowls; Chinese 
pottery; South Indian bronze sculpture; Chinese silver objects; and 
Chinese silver-gilt objects. 

Curatorial work included the documentary study of inscriptions 
on new purchases as well as those on objects already in the collection. 
Expert opinion was given to other institutions and individuals re- 
garding 834 objects and 185 photographs of objects sent in for 
examination. With the expert aid of Dr. A. K. Coomaraswamy, 
a large group of paintings in the Near Eastern section, purchased in 
1907 from Col. H. B, Hanna, has undergone complete revision and 
reclassification. 

The year's total attendance was 120,651 ; of these 1,349 visited the 
offices for general information or for study purposes. Sixteen 
groups were given docent service in the exhibition galleries, and 10 
classes were given instruction in the study room. Two lectures were 
given in the auditorium: " The Caves of the Thousand Buddhas," by 
Sir Aurel Stein ; and " Indian Sculpture : Intention and Develop- 
ment," by Dr. A. K. Coomaraswamy. 

The field expedition was able, in spite of disturbed conditions, to 
make interesting investigations at the site of the Liang dynasty 
(A. D. 502-556) tombs, near Nanking, China. 

* The Government's expense in connection with the Fi-eer Gallery of Art consists 
mainly in the care of the building and certain other custodial matters. Other expenses 
are paid from the Freer endowment funds. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 19 

BUREAU OF AMKUICAN ETHNOLOGY 

The work of the bureau covered the usual wide range of ethnologi- 
cal and archeological investigations on many Indian tribes and sites 
of the United States. The chief, Mr. M. AV. Stirling, made an 
archeological reconnaissance of the Ten Thousand Islands, Fla., and 
excavated mounds at Lacooche and at Safety Harbor, Fla. lie de- 
livered lectures before numerous scientific and educational bodies. 
Dr. Jolin R. Swanton continued his field work on the Choctaw of 
Mississij^pi and the Creeks of Oklahoma, and began the work of 
translating the words of his Timucua dictionary. Dr. Truman 
Michelson studied the Algonquian tribes of Oklahoma, and Mr. John 
P. Harrington obtained much of the language and ethnology of the 
San Juan Tribe of California through an aged informant. 

Dr. F. II. II. Roberts, jr., conducted extensive archeological ex- 
cavations at the Long H Ranch, in eastern Arizona, revealing 18 
pit houses, 3 jacal, pole, and mud structures, and a pueblo ruin con- 
taining 49 rooms and 4 kivas. Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt continued his 
studies of the Iroquois Indians o.f Canada and New York State, and 
Dr. Francis LaFlesche nearly completed his Osage dictionary before 
his retirement on December 26, 1929. Miss Frances Densmore 
studied the music of 10 tribes — the Acoma, Menominee, Winnebago, 
Yuma, Cocopa, Mohave, Yagui, Makah, Clayoquot, and Quilente. 

Five bulletins and a list of publications of the bureau were issued 
during the year, and a total of 24,8G8 copies of bureau publications 
were distributed. 

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE 
The Exchange Service handled during the year a total of 694,665 
packages of governmental, scientific, and literary publications, which 
represented a total weight of 708,094 pounds. This constitutes an 
increase of 12 per cent in number of packages, and 14 per cent in 
weight over the previous 3'ear. 

The material handled by the Exchange Service includes publica- 
tions received from this country for transmission to foreign coun- 
tries, and also those sent from abroad for distribution to addresses 
in this country. They are classified as parliamentary documents, 
departmental documents, and miscellaneous scientific and literary 
publications. The parliamentary and departmental documents in- 
clude all matter published by Congress and by the Government de- 
partments, bureaus, and commissions. These constitute the bulk 
of the publications handled by the Exchange Service, 74 per cent 
of the work of tlie ofTice being conducted in behalf of the Ignited 
States governmental establishments. The miscellaneous scientific 
and literary publications are received for distribution chiefly from 
learned societies, educational institutions, scientific organizations, 
and museums. 



20 ANNUAL REPOKT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK 

Animals added to the collection during the year numbered 759, 
while 974 were removed through death, exchange, and return of ani- 
mals, the collection standing at 1,996 at the close of the year. Owing 
to lack of further housing facilities, it has been necessary to choose 
very carefully in making additions to the collection, with the result 
that the park now contains a great many rarities, including a number 
of species not shown in any other American zoo. 

The total attendance at the park was estimated at 2,525,141, about 
the same as in the preceding year. This total included 28,814 stu- 
dents from 465 different schools. The value of the park as an educa- 
tional institution, quite apart from its recreational value, is coming 
to be more and more recognized. Here may be seen visitors of all 
ages and all degrees of learning, from the j^oung child to the veteran 
research M^orker and the advanced medical man, each of whom can 
learn something of value concerning animals and animal life. 

Construction of the new reptile house authorized by Congress 
was started in March, 1930. The best modern ideas as to the exhibi- 
tion of reptiles will be incorporated in the building, which will per- 
mit the National Zoo to show for the first time an adequate 
representation of these interesting creatures. The next most ur- 
gently needed building is one for small mammals, with which also 
would be exhibited the great apes; these latter are at present shown 
in inadequate cages where comparatively few people can see them 
at a time. 

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY 

The central station at Washington and the three observing sta- 
tions on Mount Montezuma, Chile; Table Mountain, Calif.; and 
Mount Brukkaros, South West Africa, have continued the exact 
measurement of the intensity of the radiation of the sun as it is at 
mean solar distance outside the earth's atmosphere. The values from 
Mount Montezuma have continued to be satisfactory and are cabled 
to Washington each day ; the values from Table Mountain are found 
to be influenced by the haziness or humidity of the atmosphere, 
and a new method of reduction to allow for these effects was being 
developed at the close of the year, preliminary trials of which give 
promising results. Reduction of Mount Brukkaros observations is 
being postponed until this method is further tested for Table 
Mountain. 

It has recently been discovered that a variation of large percentage 
exists in the quantity of ozone at high levels above Table Mountain. 
In order to make ozone corrections to solar constant values obtained 
there from the year 1925 on, it became necessary to devise a method 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 21 

(if computing the correction fiom the daily sohir constant observa- 
tions themselves, and this wiis successfully accomplished during the 
year. 

The most important feature of the year's work was the discovery of 
an apparently considerable influence of short-period solar variation 
on the temperature of the United States. The variations as recorded 
through six consecutive years at Mount Montezuma were compared 
with temperature changes in Washington, Williston, and Yuma, 
selecting for the purpose sequences of ascending and descending solar 
radiation values occupying about four days per sequence. Cor- 
responding to the average change of 0.8 per cent in the sun, there 
appear to be temperature changes of the order of 5° F. in Washing- 
ton. The sign of the correlation changes in a very interesting way 
during the year. Although this relation is complicated, it offers 
promise for weather forecasting nearly a week in advance. These 
are tentative results. It is proposed to study barometric pressures as 
well as temperatures, and to extend the investigation to other parts 
of the United States and of the world. 

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE 

Since the suspension of publication of the International Catalogue 
because of the inability of European countries to bear their share 
of its financial support following the World War, the United States 
bureau has made it a policy to spend only as much of the annual 
congressional appropriation as is needed to keep the organization 
alive pending the resumption of publication. 

The report of the assistant in charge. Appendix 9, quotes from 
an article in Science by Dr. E. C. Richardson, who presents a strong 
case for the importance of revivifying the International Catalogue. 
His conclusions, in brief, are that the catalogue is an indispensable 
tool for research workers; that an organization which, if scrapped, 
would require a $3,000,000 endowment to build up again, is ready 
and waiting to resume the work of the catalogue when a very modest 
fund is made available to it; and that in the catalogue the research 
(rust endowments will find an organization that pan give the greatest 
bibliographical service to research for the least outla}' of funds. 

NECROLOGY 

WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT 

William Howard Taft, Chief JiLstice of the United States and 
Chancellor of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, 
died in Washington on March 8, 1930. Of a man so prominently 
before the American public for so many years, it seems unnecessary 
here to present more than a very brief outline of his career. 
2809.S— 31 3 



22 AXNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

Born in Cincinnati in 1857, Taft graduated from Yale University 
in 1878. He took the law course, and after a short period as law 
reporter for a newspaper, his public career began. In turn assistant 
prosecuting attorney, collector of internal revenue of the first dis- 
trict of Ohio, and assistant county solicitor of Hamilton County, 
he was next appointed judge of the Supreme Court of Cincinnati, 
and in 1890, Solicitor General of the United States. For eight 
years beginning 1892 he was United States circuit judge for the 
sixth judicial district, and in 1901, President McKinley appointed 
him civil governor of the Philippine Islands. In 1908 came his 
election as President of the United States, and after the completion 
of his term, there followed a few years of private life. In 1921 he 
was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, from which 
position he had been forced by ill health to resign only a short time 
before his death. 

Through his many high offices, Mr. Taft had been connected with 
the Institution for many years, serving as a member of the Insti- 
tution and its presiding officer, ex officio, and as Chancellor of its 
Board of Regents. 

GEORGE PERKINS MERRILL 

George Perkins Merrill, head curator of geology, died suddenly 
in Auburn, Me., on August 15, 1929. Doctor Merrill was born in 
Auburn on May 31, 1854, and was graduated from the University of 
Maine with the degree of B. S. in 1879. He pursued advanced 
studies at Wesleyan and Johns Hopkins Universities which later 
resulted in the degrees of M. S. and Ph. D. from his alma mater. 
In 1893 he became professor of geology at Columbian, later George 
Washington University, continuing his lectures until 1916, and was 
given the honorary degree of Sc. D. in 1917. 

Doctor Merrill's connection with the National jSIuseum began with 
the organization of 1880. He served in various capacities in the 
geological division until 1897, when, under a reorganization, he was 
appointed head curator of the department of geology, which position 
he held until his death. The growth of the department from a com- 
paratively few specimens, resulting chiefly from the United States 
Land Office and other early Government surveys, to its present 
position among the notable geological collections of the world, is 
largely due to Doctor Merrill's ability as an executive and his devo- 
tion and loyalty to the Institution. He was preeminently a museum 
man and an artist in methods of display, as can be attested by the 
harmonious arrangement of the exhibition halls under his charge. 

Doctor JMerrill early became interested in building stones and was 
regarded as the leading expert on this subject, his opinion being 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 23 

sou<^lit in connection with such important structures as the Lincohi 
Memorial, the Washington Cathedral, and many other public build- 
ings. His treatise on "Stones for liuilding and Decoration'' run 
to three editions. 

Again, his researches on rock weathering and soil formation led 
an eminent authority to say: "The greatest work on the genesis of 
soils we owe to Merrill." A publication on "Non-Metallic Min- 
erals — Their Occurrence and Uses '' further illustrates his versatility 
in geological research. 

Later, the collectit)n of meteorites in the Museum became the object 
of special interest, his researches on these celestial bodies, resulting 
in no less than GO papers, receiving recognition b}'^ the presentation 
of the J. Lawrence JSmith meda! of (he National Academy of Sciences. 
•' The Story of Meteorite.^-," written in popular style, appeared us 
part 1 of volume ?> of the Smithsonian Scientific Series — " Minerals 
from Earth and Sky." 

Among the most interesting and valuable of his many contribu- 
tions is his historical work on geological subjects. His " contribu- 
tions to a History of American Geology," published in 1904 as part 
of the report of the Smithsonian Institution, was, in 1924, e.xpandcd 
into " The First One Hundred Years of American Geology." He also 
compiled a " History of American State Geological and Natural 
History Surveys," issued as Bulletin 109 of the National Museum. 

A paper for the Museum's archives, practically completed just 
before Doctor Merrill left on his vacation from which he never re- 
turned, is "An Historical Account of the Department of Geology in 
the U. S. National Museum " — most timely in its preparation since 
no other could have been so well qualified to prepare such a record. 

ARTHUR BENONI BAKEIt 

Arthur Benoni Baker, assistant director of the National Zoological 
Park, died in "Washington February 8, 1930. Mr. Baker was born 
at Otisco, New York, in 1858, and as a young man worked in Ward's 
natural science establishment. At that time Ward's, though a com- 
mercial institution, served as a training school for numerous young 
men who afterwards attained distinction in scientific work. With Mr. 
Baker were such men as Carl Akeley and William Morton Wheeler. 
Later Mr. Baker spent eight years fossil hunting in Kansas, and 
then in Novemlx'r, 1890, accepted a position in the National Zoologi- 
cal Park, where he served continuously until his death, except for a 
period of six months when he was on furlough and in charge of the 
Boston Zoological Garden. 

In 1909 he made a trip to Nairobi, East Africa, and brought home 
a collection of animals that had been presented to the Zoo by Sir 



24 ANNUAL EEPOIIT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

Donald MacMillan through Theodore Roosevelt. On the trip out 
he made a hurried inspection of many zoological gardens in Europe 
and much of the information he gained there was used in the develop- 
ment of the National Zoological Park. Another expedition was to 
Porto Rico, where in compan}^ with other Smithsonian scientists he 
made valuable natural history collections. 

It is largely due to the knowledge and devotion of Mr. Baker that 
the Zoological Park has attained its present position. His Imowl- 
edge of zoos in general was profound; of the National Zoological 
Park, complete. He retained in his remarkable memory an almost 
unbelievable mass of detail. 

Respectfully submitted. 

C. G. Abbot, Secretm^y. 



APPENDIX 1 
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM 

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the condi- 
tion and operations of the United States National Museum for the 
fiscal year ended June 30, 1930 : 

The total appropriations for tlie maintenance of the National Mu- 
seum for this period amounted to $702,514, an increase of $14,490 over 
the appropriations for the year 1929. Of this amount $9,500 pro- 
vided salaries for five additional positions on the staff, namely, an 
assistant curator of moUusks, an additional clerk in the administra- 
tive office, and three sergeants of the watch. This assistance in per- 
sonnel has very definite value in the administration of the various 
units concerned and brings added efticiency to the organization as 
a whole. 

A small sum of the increase indicated provided efficiency promo- 
tions for a number of trained mechanics who had not been cared 
for properly when other clasi^es of employees had been promoted 
previously. There was a further increase to provide for the con- 
struction of a gallery to give additional space for study collections 
in the vertebrate paleontological laboratory, where crowding had 
become serious. The construction for this is of the same general 
type as that used for a similar gallery in the National Herbarium. 

The second deficiency bill for 1930 contained an item of $3,500 
under repairs and alterations of buildings, available in the fiscal 
years 1930 and 1931, for the remodelling of a comfort room in the 
Arts and Industries Building. As this bill became law on July 
3, 1930, after the close of the fiscal year here under report, these 
funds accordingly will be used in the fiscal year 1931, and a state- 
ment on them will be made in the report for that year. 

Growth in personnel in the National Museum has progressed 
reasonably, but further additions are required in a number of the 
administrative units before the staff can be considered properly de- 
veloped to enable it to function as it should. There are several 
major groups of animals wliere systematic workers of high type are 
needed as curators to carry on necessary research that the Museum 
may be able to assist the public who desire information concerning 
the creatures in question. Additional assistance in tlie scientific 
grades is also required in some of the m;ij(»r groups whoie the volume 

26 



26 ANNUAL EEPOIIT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

of work is beyond the capacity of the present staff to handle en- 
tirely adequately. Clerical assistance also is at a minimum, and 
there remain a considerable number of offices in which stenographic 
and clerical help is not at present available. Naturally this detracts 
from the efficiency of these offices since scientific workers who should 
be occupied otherwise are through necessity compelled to devote con- 
siderable time to routine work of a clerical nature. It is impera- 
tive that regular additions be made to our personnel to assist in these 
necessary functions. Further assistance is required in the shops, on 
the guard force, and in the labor force since it is at present neces- 
sary annually to obtain temporary workers in the grou^DS concerned. 
The employment of temporary services, particularly where specialized 
Avork is concerned, is of doubtful expediency since necessarily part 
of the time is occupied in training, and there is more liability to 
error than with workers on a permanent basis. 

Exploration and field w-ork under the National Museum are 
financed largely by the Smithsonian Institution through its private 
income, and by friends who supply funds for various projects of 
particular interest. Existing approj^riations for the National Mu- 
seum are so largely taken up with routine expenditures that there 
is little available that may be used for research in the field. Further 
money should come from our appropriations for these ends. 

Interest of the general public in scientific matters, particularly 
of the type that comes within the scope of the National Museum, is 
plainly evident through the demand that comes for popular exposi- 
tion in scientific subjects. So far as the National Museum is con- 
cerned this interest is shown by the nearly 2,000,000 visitors who come 
annually to its halls. These persons, together with the many others 
who have an interest in such things, are among those who contribute 
to national income in the form of taxes. With their interest in these 
matters in mind it seems entirely logical that a part of their con- 
tributions should be devoted to furthering the development of the 
Museum which serves them in such various ways. 

ADDITIONS TO THE NATURAL HISTORY BUILDING 

The Congress gave definite consideration during the year to the 
question of additional housing for the collections of the National 
Museum, with the result that the Smoot-Elliott bill authorizing the 
extension of the Natural History Building through wings at the 
east and west ends at a cost of $6,500,000 was passed without a dis- 
senting vote. The bill was aj^proved by the President on June 19, 
1930. 

Under this authorization it is planned to add to the present build- 
ing so that it will extend from Ninth to Twelfth Streets on the same 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 27 

width of baso. In froiiorul it is contcmplatotl that the style of tlie 
present structure will bo duplicatocl, with the fjround and third floor 
occupied by ofKces and laboratories, and the two intermediate iloors 
doA'ote*! to exhibits. Present plans contemplate a request for funds 
for the preparation of definite architect's designs in the ur<zent defi- 
ciency bill for 1931. The friendly consideration given to the import- 
ant matter of the authorization for this work by the congressional 
committees involved has been deeply appreciated by the Institution. 

The construction planned will provide adequately for housing 
needs for the natural history collections. Following this, careful 
consideration should be given to proper space for the arts and indus- 
tries series. The present building occupied by these collections, the 
old National Museum built in 1881, is now antiquated in design and 
unfitted for modern needs in museum exhibition. It should be re- 
placed by a new structure that will provide ample halls for the show- 
ing of the important and valuable exhibits of the type mentioned. 

The historical collections of the Nation, of interest and attraction 
to every patriotic American, at present are also in the old building. 
These collections, which are steadily growing with the accession of 
irreplaceable specimens, should be housed in a separate structure 
where such objects as the Star-Spangled Banner and the memorabilia 
of many famous men may be fittingly and attractively displayed. 

COLLECTIONS 

Additions to the collections of the National Museum during the 
fiscal year have reached the total of 410,815 separate specimens, 
the greater part of these coming as in previous years to the depart- 
ment of biology. The additions, while not quite equal to those of last 
year, are of comparable value and importance to those of the last 
few years. Large donations have come from a number of sources, 
the museum as a governmental institution being recognized as a 
permanent organization in which valuable material will receive the 
care and attention that insure long preservation. The growing 
recognition of the National Museum as a repository of this kind is 
highly gratifying. Materials of various kinds sent in for examina- 
tion and report during the year amounted to 1,30G lots, including 
many thousands of separate specimens. Gifts of duplicate materials 
made to schools and other educational institutions included 11,474 
specimens, while in exchange with other scientific organizations and 
individuals there were sent out 12,(540 specimens, these being dupli- 
cates for which return was made to the Museum collections. Loans 
to scientific workers outside of Washington included 33,208 speci- 
mens, many of which were of considerable value. 

Following is a digest of the more important accessions for the 
year in the various dopartmonts and divisions of the Museum: 



28 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

Anthropology. — Collections from Alaska again are of major im- 
portance among the accessions in this department. Among these 
there are two principal lots of material that have come in part 
through the assistance of the Smithsonian Institution. Doctor 
Hrdlicka in travel down the Yukon River obtained rich collections 
representing Indian and Eskimoan tribes, and in addition obtained 
valuable sets of ivory implements from the Bering Sea area. Henry 
B. Collins, jr., in further field work on St. Lawrence Island and sites 
on the coast of Bering Sea and Kotzebue Sound secured a collection 
containing man}^ ivory and other implements that are of great 
value in supplementing his collections of last year. Further there 
was obtained by purchase a series of specimens from Point Hope 
representing various phases of Eskimoan culture. The entire lot 
represents a selection of western Eskimoan artifacts from the earliest 
times, still further increasing the value of our excellent series of this 
kind. 

A further collection from Nigeria and the Gold and Ivory coasts 
of Africa presented by C. C. Roberts has supplemented previous gifts 
of a similar nature from the same source, until now we have for the 
first time adequate representation of the Haussa, Fulah, and Yoruba 
tribes. 

The Department of Agriculture, through Dr. E. W. Brandes of 
the Bureau of Plant Industry, transferred excellent collections of 
stone axes, decorated human heads, and other objects from New 
Guinea. 

Collections from Tibet were presented by Charles S. Isham, of 
New York, including prayer stones and other objects of a religious 
nature, as well as materials of personal adornment. Further collec- 
tions have come from China through the efi'orts of the Rev. D. C. 
Graham, of Szechwan. 

In American archeology there came three decorated limestone 
blocks from the Maya Temple of Chac Mool, deposited by the 
Republic of Mexico tlirough its Secretaria de Educacion. Valuable 
specimens were obtained from the excavations in Colorado of Dr. 
Frank H. H. Roberts, jr., of the Bureau of American Ethnology, 
and from field work by H. W. Krieger, of the National Museum, 
in the Dominican Republic, funds for this project having been fur- 
nished by Dr. W. L. Abbott. 

Through the Bruce Hughes fund there were acquired artifacts 
of Sumerian and Babylonian origin for exhibition with other 
materials from the Old World. 

Biology. — In the department of biology there were secured exten- 
sive collections as a gift of the National Geographic Society, includ- 
ing particularly birds and plants collected by Dr. Joseph F. Rock 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 29 

in western China, and birds, insects, antl plants obtained by E. G. 
Holt in northern Brazil. Other excellent collections came from the 
Hon. Gilford Pinchot as the result of a cruise to the Caribbean and 
Pacific Islands on the yacht Manj Pinchot. A notable collection 
obtained through the cooperation of the Navy Department was 
secured by Dr. H. C. Kellers, United States Navy, on the Island of 
Panay, in the Philippines, tluring service as medical ollicer to the 
Naval Solar Eclipse Expedition. 

Doctor Bartsch, traveling under the Walter llalhbone Bacon 
Travelling Scholarship, obtained large series of moUusks in the West 
Indies, which add remarkably to our collections from that region. 
Dr. G. A. MacCallum, of Baltimore, presented his entire collection of 
helminthological material, including many type specimens. 

Collections forwarded by the Rev. D. C. Graham from western 
China include many things of great value, particularly among mam- 
mals, birds, fishes, reptiles, and insects. There may be mentioned 
especially three skins of the giant Panda. 

Further excellent collections from Siam were received from Dr. 
Hugh M. Smith, long an honorary associate of the Institution. 

A. C. Bent, a collaborator of the Smithsonian Institution, depos- 
ited in the division of birds his collection of North American birds' 
eggs, a most excellent and complete series. From the Minneapolis 
Public Library there were obtained more than 1,500 bird skins from 
the Philippines comprising the Menage collection. The Smith- 
sonian-Parish expedition to Haiti obtained excellent series of birds, 
reptiles, and other materials. Under the Swales fund, through 
money left by the late Bradshaw H. Swales, there were secured 34 
skins of birds new to the Museum. 

The Victorias Milling Co. of Manila presented a considerable 
number of insects collected by Dr. W. Dwiglit Pierce. For the 
division of mollusks there were purchased series of land shells from 
Jamaica and Haiti through the Chamberlain fund. Through a 
botanical expedition to Peru and Upper Brazil under E. P. Killip 
there were acquired more than 27,000 specimens of plants. 

Geology. — In the department of geology the single accession ol 
greatest importance during the year was the crystal ball presented 
to the National Museum by Mrs. Worcester Heed Warner as a 
memorial to her husband, long a friend to the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion. This ball of flawless crystal 12% inches in diameter, weigliiiii.' 
lOC-Yi pounds, is believed to be the largest perfect sphere of its kind 
in existence. It is one of the most striking objects found in the 
Museum halls. 

Through the income of the Koebling fund there have been secured 
23 species of minerals not previously represented in our collections,

together with a considerable number of exceptionally fine specimens 
of other kinds. Among them there may be mentioned a topaz crystal 
weighing over 7 pounds, sets of tourmaline crystals, and a cut yellow 
sapphire of 25.8 carats. 

Through the Frances Lea Chamberlain fund there were secured 
blue and yellow diamonds, a Brazilian emerald, and carvings of 
jade, tourmaline, coral, amber, carnelian and lapis-lazuli. 

Valuable sjjecimens of ores and stones have come from several 
sources. Numerous type specimens have been accessioned in the 
division of stratigraphic paleontology, particularly fossil plants 
described by Prof. E. W. Berry. Further fossil plants from the 
Grand Canyon of the Colorado in Arizona, collected and described 
by Dr. David White, have been presented by the Carnegie Institution 
of Washington. 

A collection of several hundred fossils from English localities 
secured by Mr. B. B. Bancroft has come as a deposit from the Smith- 
sonian Institution. Other valuable specimens secured in field work by 
Dr. Resser have included more than 1,200 Cambrian forms. 

Eight articulated skeletons of the fossil horse Mesohipjjus hairdi 
from the Oligocene of Nebraska were purchased. Large series of 
excellent fossil horse skulls have come also from the field work 
of Dr. Gidley in Idaho. Valuable material collected by Mr. C, W. 
Gilmore in the San Juan Basin, N. Mex., has come to the fossil 
reptile collection through work financed by the Smithsonian 
Institution. 

Dr. Remington Kellogg and N. H. Boss collecting in Alabama 
and Mississippi under the auspices of the Carnegie Institution 
of Washington secured a valuable specimen of zeuglodont, together 
with other material. There may be mentioned also a complete skull 
and other bones of a large whalebone whale collected by Dr. Kellogg 
at Governors Run, Md. 

Arts and industries. — The gift of the Rudolph Eickemeyer col- 
lection of photographs and books to the section of photography con- 
stituted one of the most important accessions to this department, 
as it includes not only an excellent series of pictorial photographs 
but also a library of books dealing with this subject, and a series 
of medals and awards made to Mr. Eickemeyer for the excellence 
of his work. The gift is further accompanied by an item in the 
will of Mr. Eickemeyer through which $15,000 is designated as a 
fund to be used in connection with this collection.

General of Posts of China. 



32 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK 

Researches in the field have been carried on as usual by various 
members of the scientific staff of the Museum, principally by means 
of funds provided by the Smithsonian Institution through its pri- 
vate income, with assistance in some instances in the form of con- 
tributions from friends of the organization who have been interested 
in different projects. Certain investigations have been financed 
also under some of the specific funds of the Smithsonian. For some 
expeditions small allotments have been made from the annual ap- 
propriations, but these constituted only a small part of the total 
expenditure for field work, b}' far the greater portion having come 
from other sources. An additional appropriation that could be 
used for field researches is a definite need of the National Museum, 
and would be of great assistance in promoting its work. A brief 
account of field work for the present year follows : 

During the months of December and January, Henry B. Collins, 
jr., assistant curator in the division of ethnology, conducted field 
work in Mississippi, the investigations being carried on in cooper- 
ation with the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, 
that organization being represented by Messrs. Moreau B. Cham- 
bers and James A. Ford. The most important result was the finding 
in Yazoo County of an ancient Indian village site in which the 
complete floor plan of a large house site was traced by means of 
the postholes. The structure was round, 60 feet in diameter, and 
was probablj'' a council house somewhat similar to those described 
by early explorers in the Creek and Cherokee regions. The open- 
ing of the fiscal year in July found Mr. Collins in the field excavat- 
ing at old Eskimo sites on St. Lawrence Island in Bering Sea, and 
along the coast of Kotzebue Sound in western Alaska. His work 
included a reconnaissance of the western Alaskan coast from Norton 
Sound to Point Hope. Actual excavations were carried on at Cape 
Kialegak on St. Lawrence, Cape Denbigh, Imaruk Basin, and Point 
Hope, resulting in a large archeological collection. Work on St. 
Lawrence Island was begun again in June, 1930, with most impor- 
tant results as indicated by preliminar}'' reports from the field. 
The National Museum is deeply indebted to the Revenue Cutter 
Service for its active cooperation in these iuA^estigations through trans- 
portation provided on its vessels to points otherwise inaccessible. 

Field work in the Dominican Republic was continued by Herbert 
W. Krieger, curator in the division of ethnology, who began 
archeological and historical studies in that area in 1928. Mr. Krie- 
ger's investigations were made possible by the assistance of Dr. W. L. 
Abbott, whose interest in the island is of long standing and whose 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 33 

first visit to Santo Domingo was in 1883. Investigations during 
tho cunvnt your incliuled a reconnaissance of the mountainous inte- 
rior of the provinces of La Vega, and of Azua, and actual excava- 
tions at former Indian viUage sites in the valley of Constanza and 
on the Caribbean coast at Andres, on the Bay of Andres, 25 miles 
east of the capital city of Santo Domingo. There was no noteworthy 
distinction between the artifacts recovered from middens at Con- 
stanza and at Andres except for the lack of marine products such as 
bones of fish and turtles, and shells of iiiollusks in tho middens of the 
central mountains. Shell deposits on the Caribbean coast resemble 
those found in caves in the province of Samana, and also those in- 
cluded in the kitchen middens of Monte Cristi Province. Middens 
throughout the Dominican Republic yield typically Arawakan objects 
of great variety, ranging from the petaloid polished stone celt, dec- 
orated pottery with incised and punctate designs, and molded figurine 
heads of post-archaic tj'pe, to the beveled celt of Strombus gigas, 
shallow undecorated earthenware bowls, crude beads of shell with 
hour-glass-shape perforation, and other artifacts that in Cuba have 
been designated as products of the " Ciboney." Frontal-occipital 
(?eformation of skulls from cemeteries, fragments of stone collars, 
and well-known types of Arawak zemis supply additional evidence 
of the thorough penetration of the island by the Arawak and con- 
versely tend to stress the lack of cultural stratigraphy or evidence 
of the previous occupancy of the island by pre-Arawak tribes. 

From May 15 to September 23, 1929, N. M. Judd, curator of Amer- 
ican archeology, was in Arizona supervising the Third Beam Expedi- 
tion of the National Geographic Society. As a result of these inves- 
tigations. Dr. A. E. Douglass, of the University of Arizona, was 
able to complete his tree-ring chronology by establishing a single 
series of annual growth rings in pine trees, extending from the year 
1929 back to 700 A. D. Thus, with over 1,200 years represented, 
some 40 pre-Spanish Pueblo villages of the Southwest have been 
correlated with our own calendar — certainly the most outstanding 
contribution to American archeology in the past quarter century. 
Following his researches for the National Geographic Society, the 
curator, at the suggestion of Senator Carl Haydcn, visited the Gila 
and Salt River valleys, Ariz., to examine remaining vestiges of a 
former network of prehistoric canals and to determine the most feas- 
ible means of pre.serving a permanent record of them. On behalf 
of the Bureau of American Ethnology, Mr. Judd returned to Ari- 
zona in mid-January to cooperate with Lieut. Edwin B. Bobzien and 
Sergt. R. A. Stockwell, of the Army photographic personnel, in an 
aerial survey of the major prehistoric canal systems bordering both 
the Gila and Salt Rivers. The mosaic photographic maps made from 



84 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

the air resulting from this survey, though not yet completely studied, 
indicate results of importance. 

Doctor Hrdlicka, curator of physical anthropology, during the 
summer of 1929 made his second expedition to Alaska. The work of 
the present season covered the Yukon from White Horse to Fort 
Yukon as a reconnoissance, and from Fort Yukon downward con- 
tinued as an intensive exploration in abandoned and partly washed- 
away village sites, resulting in valuable collections of skeletal remains 
and archeological implements. Physical measurements were made 
on several hundred living natives, some of them the last represent- 
atives of their tribes, and facial casts and hundreds of photographs 
were taken. 

Dr. Paul Bartsch, through the Walter Kathbone Bacon Travelling 
Scholarship of the Smithsonian Institution, continued this season 
the exploration of West Indian Islands for the study of their terres- 
trial molluscan fauna, a work begun last year. He left Norfolk, Va., 
in June, 1929, for Porto Rico, wdiere at San Juan a schooner, the 
Guillermito, was chartered. Doctor Bartsch was accompanied by 
Dr. William W. Hoffman and his assistant, J. Oliver, wdio were en- 
gaged in other biological studies. The work began in Porto Rico 
and then continued to Culebra and St. Thomas. On July 11 the 
party visited the island of St. John and on the 15th St. Croix. Stops 
were next made at Tortola, San Martin, Anguilla, San Bartholo- 
mew, St. Eustatius, St. Cristopher, Nevis, Montserrat, and Grande 
Terre. On July 31 they had reached Guadeloupe, and August 1 and 
2 were on the Saints. They next visited Maria Galante and Domin- 
ica, and August 7 and 8 were at Martinique. This was followed by 
exploration of Santa Lucia, St. Vincent, and on August 17 of the 
Grenadine islets. The expedition arrived at Grenada on August 25 
and remained there until the 28th. September 1 to 4 were spent on 
Trinidad. Margarita Island, off the Venezuelan coast was visited 
September 7 and 8, followed by stops at Orchilla, El Roque, Bonaire, 
Curacao, and Aruba. On September 21 the party arrived once more 
at San Juan, Porto Rico. In addition to a rich harvest of moUusks, 
this expedition as a by-product secured numerous specimens of ani- 
mals of many groups as detailed elsewhere in this report. 

Rev. David C. Graham, long a cooperator in the field work of 
the Smithsonian, in the summer of 1929 made a collecting expedi- 
tion to the Mupin district in Szechwan, the type locality of many of 
the species discovered by the Abbe Armand David. Doctor Graham 
started from his headquarters at Suifu on June 15 and reached 
Mupin 11 days later. He made collections at several localities in 
the district with good results, obtaining numerous specimens of 
mammals, among them three flat skins of the " giant panda," birds, 
reptiles, amphibians, fishes, and insects. He returned in August to

Suifii, clmracterizin^ the trip as a successful reconnoissance. A 
number of forms in tlie diiFerent «^roups enumerated are new to the 
Museum, and the entire collection is of y;reat importance. 

Throu<rh the cooperation of Mr. Lee Parisli, of TuL^a, Olda., there 
was orfrani/cd in the late winter the Parish-Smithsonian expedition 
to Haiti, on which Mr. Parish, and Mr. and Mrs. S. AV. Parish were 
accompanied by Mr. W. M. Porryjjjo of the taxidermy staff. The 
party sailed from Miami, Fla., on February 15, on the yacht Esper- 
anza^ passinjx alon*; the north coast of Cuba, where stops for col- 
lect in <? were made at Gebara, Moa Key, the mainland opposite Moa, 
and Port Tanamo. In Haiti visits were made to Gonave and Petit 
Gonave Islands, both north and south sides of the southern penin- 
sula, Ile-a-Vache off the south coast, and Navassa Island. Mr. Per- 
ry^o returned by steamer from Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on May 28, 
arrivin<^ in New York June 2. The specimens brought back include 
35 mamnuds. about 600 birds, 206 reptiles, 281 fish, marine inverte- 
brates, and ecliinodcrms, as well as some live animals for the National 
Zoological Park. The material is of importance and will give much 
information of value concerning the area covered. 

The Museum has also had the valued cooperation of the Hon. 
Gifford Pinchot in the Pinchot South Sea Expedition which sailed 
from Brooklyn, N. Y., on March 30, 1929, in the auxiliary yacht. 
Mary Pinchot. The party consisted of the Hon. Gifford Pinchot, 
Mrs. Pinchot, Dr. H. A. Pilsbry of the Philadelphia Academy of 
Natural Sciences, and Dr. A. K. Fisher of the Biological Survey, De- 
partment of Agriculture, who through cooperation of the survey 
was detailed to make collections for the National Museum. No stops 
were made until Key West was reached on April 7, when four days 
were spent at this interesting place. A short stop was made at 
Habana, whence the expedition proceeded to Grand Cayman Island. 
On April 16 and 17 a collection of birds and other zoological speci- 
mens was made there, and the party then continued to Swan, Old 
Providence, and St. Andrews Islands. A hummingbird new to 
science was taken on the island of St. Andrews. Cristobal, in the 
Canal Zone, was reached on April 29 and on account of engine 
trouble the expedition was detained for the following month in the 
Canal Zone. On June 1 the Mai'^ij Pinchot left Balboa for Cocos 
Island, where several days were spent collecting specimens. They 
continued to the Galapagos Islands on June 11. The first stop was 
made at Tower Island, followed by visits to Indefatigable, Seymour, 
Charles, Hood, Chatham, Barrington, Albemarle, Narborough, and 
a number of smaller islands. Considerable collections of birds and 
other zoological material wore obtained by August 26, when the 
party continued westward. At Tagus Cove, Albemarle Island, the 
Ihghtless cormorant and penguin were found. From the Galapagos 



36 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

Islands the expedition proceeded 3,100 miles to the Marquesas Is- 
lands, where they visited Hiva-oa, Fatu-Hiva, Uahuka, Nukahiva, 
and later Eiao, one of the islands of the northern group. From 
this point the voyage continued to the Tuamotu Islands. Fruit 
pigeons, robber crabs and other crustaceans, corals, and shells were 
collected. The cruise was ended at Papeete, Tahiti; because of the 
lateness of the season the party returned by steamer to San Francisco, 
arriving there on October 25, 1929. The Mary P'mchot was taken 
back to Savannah, Ga., by the officers and crew. 

Through the untiring energy of Mr. Pinchot and of Doctor Fisher, 
who represented the Museum on the expedition, large and valuable 
collections including porpoises, bats, birds, reptiles, fishes, insects, 
and other animals have come to the Museum as noted elsewhere in 
this report, numerous forms being new to our collections. 

The explorations of Dr. Hugh M. Smith in Si am were continued 
throughout the year. Among other journeys he made a trip to the 
mountains of northern and northeastern Siam, where little zoological 
collecting has been done before. As in previous years a number 
of species new to science have been obtained. 

In May, 1930, Doctor Wetmore made a short collecting trip princi- 
pally for birds in the mountains of northern Spain, where he ob- 
tained a number of forms new to the Museum collections. His work 
was carried out principally from Puente de los Fierros, Busdongo, 
and Riaiio. 

Dr. Joseph F. Rock continued work, under the auspices of the 
National Geographic Society, in the semi-independent kingdom of 
Muli, in southwestern Szechwan, China, and also visited the Minya- 
konka Mountains. He made important collections of birds and 
plants, the specimens coming to the National Museum as a gift from 
the National Geographic Society. 

Mr. Ernest G. Holt, traveling under the auspices of the National 
Geographic Society, accompanied a boundary survey party along the 
Venezuelan-Brazilian frontier, returning to this country with a 
valuable collection of birds, reptiles, plants, and other material 
which was presented to the National Museum by the National Geo- 
graphic Society. 

Dr. H. C. Kellers, United States Navy, who through cooperation 
of the Navy Department was attached as surgeon to the Solar Eclipse 
Expedition to the island of Panay, P. I., returned with large zoologi- 
cal collections, principally of reptiles, fishes, and marine inverte- 
brates, which are of great scientific value. 

Dr. J. M. Aldrich was in Europe at the beginning of the fiscal year 
examining types of species of flies in the British Museum. In July 
he proceeded to Bergen, Norway, and after a brief collecting excur- 
sion there continued to Sweden, where he spent a successful season 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 37 

collecting at Are. During this work he ascended the Areskutan, 
a mountain r),000 foot high, wlioro Zottorstedt, 100 years heforo, had 
made important entomological collections. 

Doctor Aldrich left Washington on May 15, 1930, for a collecting 
trip to the liigh altitudes of Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and north- 
ern California, a journe}' on which he was absent at the end of the 
fiscal year. 

Mr. H. II. Shamel, of the division of mammals, was detailed for 
about three weeks in May, 1*J30, to collect natural history specimens 
in southwestern Missouri and eastern Kansas. Twenty days were 
spent in Barry and McDonald Counties, Mo., and a few days in 
MontgouKuy and Harvey Counties, Kans. The collection obtained 
included 65 mammals, 399 fishes, M birds, and between 100 and 125 
reptiles, invertebrates, and insects, as well as three living mammals 
for the National Zoological Park. Tiie black-tailed jack rabbit 
obtained in Barry County, Mo., was of interest as it is said to have 
been in this region for only about 20 years, though previously re- 
corded for IMissouri from Vernon County. 

E. D, Reid, of the division of fishes, was detailed from March 20 
to April 12, 1930, to make collections of fresh-water animals in the 
highlands of Nortli Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. He secured 
a fine lot of amphibians. 

E. P. Killip, associate curator of plants, accompanied by Mr. 
Albert C. Smith and Mr. W. J. Dennis, made an extended journey 
to eastern Peru and Amazonian Brazil, remaining in the field from 
April 9, 1929, to November 15, 1929. The expedition, under the 
Smithsonian Institution, made general botanical collections and in- 
vestigated especially the various plants used as fish poisons. The 
New York Botanical Garden cooperated in the project by allowing 
Mr. Smith, a member of the Garden staff, leave of absence for the 
work. Nearly 27,000 specimens were collected, and such studies as 
have been made to date show that a large number of novelties were 
obtained. ]^Iany species have never before been brought back to 
American herbaria. 

Dr. A. S. Hitchcock, custodian of the grass herbarium, spent the 
months from July to October, 1929, in South and East Africa, col- 
lecting and studying grasses. He visited Cape Colony, Transvaal, 
Portuguese East Africa, Tanganyika, Zanzibar, Kenya, and Uganda, 
obtaining a large number of specimens. He was an olticially invited 
guest of the British Association for the Advanoement of Science 
meeting in South Africa. 

Mrs. Agnes Chase, of the grass herbarium, made an expedition to 
Brazil during the montiis October to May, visiting the States of Rio 
de Janeiro, Espirito Santo, Minas Geraes, Goyaz, Sao Paulo, and 
28095—31 4

Mattogrosso. More than 2,500 collection numbers were obtained, 
with an average of five specimens to each number. 

For four months of the last fiscal year and extending into the 
early part of this, Dr. W. F. Foshag was engaged in field work 
in the borax regions of California, Nevada, and Oregon, collecting 
under the Roebling fund of the Smithsonian Institution with the 
collaboration of the Harvard Mineralogical Museum. The purposes 
of the expedition were to study the mineralogy and geology of the 
borax dejDOsits, with particular regard to their origin, and to obtain 
for the Museum a comprehensive collection of typical minerals and 
ores. It was thought desirable to undertake the work at this time 
since changes in the borax industry have rendered obsolete many of 
the most interesting of the deposits. Some very fine exhibition speci- 
mens, a comprehensive series illustrating the geology and mineralogy 
of the deposits, and much duplicate material resulted. 

In the latter part of April Doctor Foshag was detailed to examine 
some mineral localities in North Carolina. Through the courtesy of 
Messrs. Burnham S. Colburn and Will Colburn of Biltmore Forest, 
he was enabled to visit Spruce Pine, Balsam Gap, Mason's Mountain, 
Webster, and Statesville, and to collect rare uranium and other 
minerals. 

In order to carry out an expressed wish of the late Dr. Frank 
Springer, Dr. R. S. Bassler visited Europe for the purpose of making 
casts of various type specimens of crinoids preserved in foreign 
museums. His chief object was to obtain facsimiles of the specimens 
described by Barrande, which, with many other mementoes of that 
famous paleontologist, are preserved in the National Museum at 
Prague, Bohemia, this having been the scene of his greatest work. 
Under most pleasant conditions and with the hearty cooperation of 
the authorities at the museum, this work was carried to a successful 
conclusion. Doctor Bassler was also enabled to visit other European 
museums and various collecting fields. At the museums the paleon- 
tological collections were studied and personal contact established 
with the authorities; the time at the collecting fields was devoted 
mainly to a study of the stratigraphy, in order to secure data for 
the furtherance of work on our collections. 

Late in the year. Doctor Bassler, accompanied by Dr. Ferdinand 
Canu, made brief field trips in New England and along the Atlantic 
coast in furtherance of their studies on Bryozoa. 

Dr. C. E. Resser continued researches on the Cambrian of the 
Rocky Mountain region under the Smithsonian Institution. For 
a portion of the time he was accompanied by Dr. L. J. Moraes of 
the Brazilian Geological Survey, who was interested in similar 
problems. Doctor Resser's chosen field was in Montana, with a 
stop in the Yellowstone National Park to examine certain peculiar 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 39 

structures caused by al<i:al depotiits. Camp was next established on 
the Biidger llan<:e in Montana, where a restudy of the strati<jjra]ihy 
proved it to be much more complicated tlian was previously supposed. 
Thence a move westward and northwestward led into thc.Blackfoot 
country where the pre-Cambrian and Cambrian rocks were examined. 
FoIlowin<; this various ranges in southwestern Montana were visited, 
and the last part of the season was spent in the Teton Mountains in 
extendinn; the studies of the previous season. Small collections were 
made, the expedition beino; devoted mainly to field observations. 

The field expedition under the Smithsonian in charge of Mr. C. W. 
Gilmore covered certain badland areas extendinn from Kimbetoh 
northward to Farminiiton in the San Juan Basui. X. M(\\. AKhouirh 
the surface indications gave every promise of yielding rich returns, 
it was found that the majority of the leads consisted of single bones. 
Individual skeletons had evidently been widely scattered before in- 
terment, and only occasionally were portions of skeletons found to- 
gether, which fact, however, did not prevent the collecting of ma- 
terial of much scientific interest, as several news species appear to be 
represented and some known forms are new to the fauna. The col- 
lection, as a whole, is a decided contribution to the meagerly known 
faunas of the area. 

The expedition under the Smithsonian by Dr. J. "W. Gidley to the 
Snake River Valley, Idaho, inaugurated toward the end of the last 
fiscal year, was attended with unusual success — so much so, in fact, 
that a second expedition to the same region is now in progress. Well 
preserved remains of a rare extinct species of horse comprise the most 
important part of the collection, while gravel deposits in the vicinity 
yielded a large species of bison, a giant muskox, camel, horse, and 
other extinct animals of tlie Pleistocene period. 

Later in the year Doctor Gidley continued his researches dealing 
with the problem of the association of early man with the extinct 
mammalian fauna in Florida, the work being financed by contribu- 
tions from Mr. Childs Frick and by the Smithsonian. Worth-while 
data and material were obtained, though the expedition was greatly 
hindered by excessive rains which rendered it impossible to work out 
some of the most promising localities. 

Under the auspices of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, Dr. 
Remington Kellogg, a.ssisted by Mr. Norman Boss, was occupied for 
a month in exploration of the Eocene (Jackson) deposits in Alabama 
and Mississippi for zeuglodont remains. The resulting small collec- 
tion of these comparatively rare fossils was jjresented to the Museum. 
Messrs. Kellogg and Boss also made one trip of three days to the 
near-by IMiocene localities along Chesapeake Bay to collect cetacean 
remains. 



40 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 10 30 

In August members of the Maryland Geological Survey brought 
to the Museum's attention the discovery of a large whalebone whale 
skull located in Miocene deposits in the vicinity of Governors Run, 
Md. Dr. Remington Kellogg, with the assistance of Mr. A. J, Poole 
and members of the Maryland Survey staff, were successful in collect- 
ing it, the specimen being one of the first of this type discovered. 

Late in the fiscal year Mr. C. W. Gilmore was detailed to head an 
expedition into the Eocene of the Bridger Basin in southwestern 
Wyoming, and Dr. J. "W. Gidle}'^ returned to the scene of his 1929 
collections in Idaho. As both expeditions will continue well into 
next year, detailed accounts will go over until the next annual report. 

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT 

The usual routine repairs have kept the buildings of the National 
Museum in proper condition. At. the beginning of the year the 
work of safeguarding the dome of the Natural History Building 
had just been finished. Before opening the rotunda to the public 
the walls were steam-cleaned, the plastered surfaces repainted, and 
the floor repolished. The rotunda was opened finally on October 
23, 1929, after having been closed to visitors for nearly two years. 
Walls and ceilings in the north entrance to the Natural History 
Building, as well as various exhibition, office, and laboratory rooms, 
were repainted. The roadways on the east and west sides of the 
buildings were closed by gates to prevent their use as thoroughfares 
by unauthorized vehicles ; this step was taken because of several acci- 
dents that had taken place there. With the assistance of the office 
of Public Buildings and Public Parks, a steel gallery was erected 
in the storage rooms of the division of vertebrate paleontology to 
provide additional space for the storing of fossils. 

In the Arts and Industries Building the fountain in the center 
rotunda was removed because in recent months several visitors 
intent on other matters had stumbled over the coping and fallen 
into the water. Roofs and exterior woodwork were repainted, and 
various rooms and offices were redecorated. Work in enlarging the 
women's rest room was begun, a special item of $3,500 toward this 
project being included in the second deficiency act approved after 
the close of the year. 

The power plant was in operation from September 27, 1929, to 
May 28, 1930. The consumption of coal was 3,502 tons, an amount 
in excess of that burned during the previous fiscal year. The aver- 
age cost was $5.65 per ton. The Steamboat Inspection Service 
examined the boilers during the year and made certain suggestions 
as to their condition. The elevators have been regularly inspected 
by the District of Columbia inspector. The total electric current 
produced amounted to 655,253 kilowatt-hours, manufactured at a 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 41 

cost of 1.78 cents per kilowatt -hour, including interest on the plant, 
depreciation, repairs, and material. The amount of electric current 
produced represents an increase of approximately G,500 kilowatt- 
hours over that of last year, and the j^lant is now operating at its 
maxinuim capacity. As demands for electric current increase stead- 
ily it will be necessary during the coming fiscal year to purchase a 
limited amount from the local company during the winter season, in 
addition to the regular purchase made during the summer season 
when the Museum plant is not in operation. 

The ice plant manufactured 435.5 tons of ice at the average cost 
of $1.71 per ton ; this cost represents a definite reduction over that 
for the previous year. 

During the year 7 exhibition cases and bases, 308 pieces of storage, 
laboratory, and other furniture, and 2,224 drawers of various kinds 
were added, the greater part of these being manufactured in our 
shops.

MISCELLANEOUS 

The exhibition halls of the National Museum were open during 
the year on week days from 9 a. m. to 4.30 p. m. and with the excep- 
tion of the aircraft building were open Sunday afternoons from 1.30 
to 4.30; all museum buildings remained closed on December 24 and 
25, in accordance with presidential order, and were closed also on 
New Year's Day. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 43 

The flags on the Sniithsonian and ^Museum buildings were placed 
at half mast on Xovoinber 10, 10"2i), out of respect to the late James 
Wilson Good, Secretary' of War. They were Uown at half mast 
from March 9 to April 7, 1930, out of respect to ex-President William 
Howard Taft, associated for many years with the Smitlisonian 
Institution as a member of the Institution, presiding ollicer ex 
officio, Regent, and Chancellor. On November 13 the flag pole on 
the Smitlisonian building was found to be in a dangerous condition 
and was removed so tluit no flag was flown on that building until 
April 10, 1930, when a new pole was put in place on the north tower. 

Visitors to the Museum during the j^ear totaled 1,894,989, a de- 
crease of approximately 35,000 from the record of the preceding 
year. This decrease apparently reflected changed economic con- 
ditions in the country. Attendance in the several buildings of the 
National Museum was recorded as follows : Smithsonian Institution, 
282,482; Arts and Industries, 803,479; Natural History, C2o,32G; 
Aircraft, 123,700. The average daily attendance for week days was 
5, 12 J, and for Sundays 10,317. The increase in the Sunday average 
of nearly 4,000 persons per day is a certain indication of the need 
for opening the exhibits to the public on Sunday afternoons. 

During the )'ear the Museum published IG separate volumes and 
35 miscellaneous papers, while the distribution of literature 
amounted to 87,323 copies of its various books and pamphlets. Ad- 
ditions to the Museum library included 2,317 volumes and 0G8 
pamphlets, obtained partly by exchange, partly by donation, and 
partly by purchase. The library of the National Museum as separate 
from that of the Smithsonian Institution proper now contains 7G,879 
volumes and 108,297 pamphlets. Much work was done in arranging 
the catalogues of these collections. The Museum has 3G sectional 
libraries in connection with its various divisions, each containing 
the particular books relating to the work involved. These are in 
addition to the main libraries that house the works of general 
reference. 

On October 1, 1929, Dr. R. S. Bassler was made head curator of 
the department of geology. Dr. Charles E. Resser was designated 
on December 1 curator of stratigraphic paleontology. Dr. W. F. 
Foshag was made curator of the division of mineralogy and pet- 
rology on September 1, and in addition was given charge of the work 
of the division of physical and chemical geology. Mr. Edward P. 
Henderson was appointed on November IG assistant curator in the 
division last mentioned. 

Dr. Charles W. Richmond, long associate curator in the division 
of birds, was given the title of curator on July 1. On September IG 
at Dr. Richmond's own request he again became associate curator 



44 ANJ^UAL EEl'ORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

and Dr. Herbert Friedmann was appointed curator. The division 
of ethnology was reorganized during the year, with resulting change 
in status for H. W. Krieger, curator, and H. B. Collins, jr., assistant 
curator. Julian S. Warmbath was appointed taxidermist on Octo- 
ber 1. Wm. H. Egberts was given the title of chief preparator of 
the department of anthropology, and Norman H. Boss that of chief 
preparator in vertebrate paleontology. Miss Leila G. Forbes was 
appointed assistant librarian to succeed Miss Isabel L. Towner, who 
resigned on September 7. Miss Gertrude L. Woodin succeeded Miss 
Ethel A. L. Lacy, chief of the accessions department, who severed 
her connection with the Museum on September 15. On July 1 Mrs. 
Florence L. Grock was appointed principal accounting and auditing 
assistant. Michael Cahillane, Clarence K. Kyte, and William H. 
Smith were appointed sergeants July 1, On August 16 Mr. Cahil- 
lane was advanced to lieutenant, and Wm. H. Vanneman was made 
sergeant on September 1. 

Three employees left the service through the operation of the 
retirement act — Edgar W. Hanvey, cabinet-maker, after a service of 
nearly 32 years; A. C. Dufresne, lieutenant of the watch, after 18 
years on the guard force; and Carl A. Ohlson after nearly 18 years' 
service as watchman. The Museum lost through death during the 
year seven of its active workers and one member of its honorary 
scientific staff. Dr. George P. Merrill, head curator of geology, died 
August 15, 1929. Dr. Jesse Walter Fewkes, collaborator in ethnol- 
ogy, died on May 31, 1930. Other losses by death included Miss Ava 
L. Bennett, clerk stenographer, on November 11, 1929; Robert M. 
Campbell, bricklayer and plasterer, July 14, 1929; Ira W. Johnson, 
oiler, October 26, 1929; William L. Brawner, watchman, August 
25, 1929 ; Walter J. Ferguson, watchman, October 8, 1929 ; and Mrs. 
Alberta Buchanan, charwoman. May 13, 1930. 

Respectfully submitted.

Assistant Secretary. 



APPENDIX 2 
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART 

Sir : I have the honor to submit herewith my report on the opera- 
tions of the National Gallery of Art for the fiscal year ending June 
30, 1930. 

THE GALLERY COMMISSION 

The ninth annual meetinj^ of the gallery commission was held in 
the Regents' room of the Institution at 10.15 a. m., December 10, 
1929, the members present being as follows: Mr. Gari Melchers, 
chairman; and Messrs. Herbert Adams, Charles L. Borie, jr., James 
E. Eraser, J. H. Gest, Frank J. Mather, jr., Charles Moore, James 
Parmelee, E. W. Redfield, E. C. Tarbell, and Dr. Charles G. Abbot, 
ex-officio. 

Due to the absence of Dr. W. H. Holmes, secretary of the com- 
mission. Mr. James G. Taylor was requested to act as temporary 
secretary. 

The minutes of the previous annual meeting were read and ap- 
proved, followed by the reading and approval of the secretary's 
report on the activities of the gallery for the year. 

A number of the matters mentioned in this report were discussed 
very fully and with reference to the Langhorne collection, the fol- 
lowing resolution was adopted : 

Resolved, That Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Langhorne be invited to loan to the 
National Gallery of Art their collection of paintings as a temporary exhibition, 
preferably at a time convenient to them as well as to the commission. 

Doctor Abbot explained the steps taken in regard to the offer of 
Mr. Jolin Gellatly and its acceptance, stating that through an act 
of Congress funds would be provided for tlie maintenance of the 
collection during the next four years. He added that special cards 
of admission to the collection in New York had been prepared and 
tliat he would be glad to supply the members of the commission with 
them. After discussion, the following resolution was adopted : 

Resolved, That a committee consisting of Doctor Abbot and Mr. Melchers 
be appointed to prepare a formal acknowledgment of appreciation and thanks 
to Mr. Gellatly for his generous gift. 

45 



46 ANNUAL KEPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

The acknowledgment duly prepared and forwarded is as follows, 

January 6, 1930. 
Deak Mr. Gellatly : At the annual meeting of the National Gallery of Art 
Commission, hekl at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C., on the 
10th day of December, 1920, the following resolutions were unanimously 
adopted : 

Resolved, That the deep and appreciative thanks of this commission be, and 
they hereby are, extended to Mr. John Gellatly, of New York City, for his 
generous action in donating to the National Gallery of Art the fine and valu- 
able art collection which, during a long term of j-ears, he has assembled with 
so much pains and care, and with such rare discrimination and artistic taste. 

Resolved, That this collection constitutes an important addition to the Na- 
tional Gallery of Art ; that it will for all time to come be an outstanding 
feature of this Institution ; and that it represents a great national asset in the 
development of the art of our country. 

Resolved, That these resolutions be spread in full upon the minutes of this 
meeting, as a lasting tribute to the generosity of the donor, and that a copy 
thereof be transmitted to Mr. Gellatly with assurance of the warm regard and 
sincere appreciation of the members of the National Gallery of Art Commis- 
sion, and with their cordial good wishes for his future health and happiness. 
Sincerely yours. 

(Signed) Charles G. Abbot, 

Secretary, Smithsonian Institution. 
(Signed) Gari Melchers, 

Chairman, National Gallery of Art Commission. 
Mr. John Gellatly, 

New York City. 

The Ranger exhibit was very fully discussed. It was the sense 
of the meeting that members of the commission should make 
their inspection of the exhibit entirely as individuals and that 
each member should give his personal expression of opinion in 
regard to the selections jDroper to be added to the National Gal- 
lery. It was also decided that these votes should be regarded as 
strictly confidential. The following resolution was adopted : 

Resolved, That the commission extend to the Council of the National Acad- 
emy of Design an invitation as a body to view the Hanger exhibit. 

Mr. Moore brought up the matter, which had been referred to pre- 
viously, of providing a fund for the encouragement and support of 
young artists until they had " arrived." He had not been successful 
in getting one of the large philanthropical organizations to arrange 
for this as yet, but he was glad to say that such provision had been 
incorporated in the will of a public-spirited citizen to become oper- 
ative upon his death. 

EVENTS OF THE YEAR 

Among the more noteworthy events of the year was the assemblage 
in Washington and exhibition in the gallery of the group of paintings 
purchased by the Council of the National Academy of Design in 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 47 

accordance with i)rovisions of the Henry Waril K:in«^cr bequest. 
This bequest provides for tlie purchase from year to year of paint- 
in«,'s by American artists which shall be assi<]jncd to art institutions 
throughout the country, the National Gallery being given the privi- 
lege of selecting from these purchases such examples as may be re- 
garded as desirable additions to the national collections. There is 
thus established in perpetuity a procedure which .should prove of 
prime importance in preserving a representative series of American 
paintings continuing from year to year and period to period, an 
historical measure not heretofore undertaken by any nation. 

Purchases under the Ranger bequest began in 1*J20, and in 1930, 
78 examples had been secured and distributed. The assemblage of 
these in Washington, December 10, 11)29, was arranged to enable 
the gallery commission to inspect the works and make tentative 
selections for the national collection. Final steps on acceptance can 
not be taken, however, until within the 5-year period beginning 10 
years after the artist's death in each case. 

It has been suggested that acceptance of paintings by living 
l)ainters be regarded as tentative acceptances only so that any work 
chosen may be returned to the recipient institution whence it came 
when a superior work by the same artist becomes available. 

The addition of a single Ranger bequest work per year to the 
gallery would certainly not seem excessive, and at this rate in 100 
years the gallery would be enriched by the ownership of 100 of the 
most masterly American works of the century. 

Two distinct points of view may be held regarding acceptances 
of paintings by the galler}'. First, that there should be included 
only recognized Old World masterpieces with possibly occasional and 
rare outstanding examples of American work of corresponding art 
value, and second that the National Gallery should first of all take 
this opportunity to build up an unbroken series of American works 
of the first order. 

In the opinion of the director the authorities of the American 
National Gallery looking to the far future should not be content 
with accumulations of the art of the past, representing closed 
chapters of the history of art. As a great people we should have an 
assured art futui'e, a future worthy of systematic record and repre- 
sentation. 

A million Old AVorld masterpieces installed in great American 
buildings will not make an Ameiican National Gallery, and in his 
view a commission or other oflicial body concerned in the estab- 
lishment of a national art collection shoulil recognize the distinction 



48 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

between the history of the world art of the past and the story of 
art in America to be revealed as the centuries and millenniums pass. 
The essential concept of an American National Gallery is the 
assemblage of an adequate number of the best available products of 
the American brush (or chisel) from period to period and this is 
exactly what the Ranger bequest aims to do. 

SPECIAL EXHIBITIONS HELD IN THE GALLERY 

The special exhibitions held in the gallery during the fiscal year 
formed no small part of its activities and are as follows: 

THE HENEY WARD KANGEB EXHIBITION 

The exhibition of paintings purchased to date by the Council of the 
National Academy of Design from the Henry Ward Ranger fund, 
was opened on the evening of December 10, 1929, with a reception 
by the Secretary and Regents of the Institution, the director of 
the gallery, and the members of the National Gallery of Art Com- 
mission. The National Academy of Design was represented by Mr. 
Charles P. Curran, corresponding secretary; Mr. Albert P. Lucas, 
assistant corresponding secretary; Mr. Henry Prellwitz, treasurer; 
and Messrs. Charles S. Chapman, Ernest L. Ipsen, and Carl Run- 
gius, of the council of the academy. The exhibit closed on January 
31, 1930. 

All of the paintings, 78 in number, are by outstanding contempo- 
rary American artists and, as stated above, under the terms of Mr. 
Ranger's will the National Gallery has the privilege of claiming any 
of them which it deems desirable for the national collections within 
the 5-year period beginning 10 years after the artist's death, and 
ending 15 years after his death. In the meantime the pictures are 
assigned by the Council of the National Academy of Design to 
institutions which maintain a free art gallery. These institutions 
lent the pictures for the present exhibition, in which for the first time 
the Ranger fund pictures have been assembled in one place. Pay- 
ment of expenses of transportation and insurance was made pos- 
sible through a grant of $1,000 voted by the Carnegie Corporation 
of New York. This grant was procured through the endeavors of 
Mr. Gari Melchers, chairman of the National Gallery of Art Com- 
mission. 

Members of the National Gallery Commission submitted, confiden- 
tially, their votes as to the paintings exhibited which were suitable 
for permanent exhibition by the gallery. This vote is preserved for 
the information of those who in future will be charged with selecting 
pictures from the Ranger collections.

COPTING PAINTINGS 

While the gallery has no facilities for the accommodation for 
artists desiring to copy works of art in its collections, permission is 
given in special cases. During the present fiscal year two artists, 
both of Washington, D. C, were permitted to copy portraits in the 
Harriet Lane Johnston collection : Mrs. Charles H. L. Johnston 
(Birdie Abbott Johnston) copied the portrait of Lady Hammond 
by Sir Joshua Rej^nolds, and Miss Angelica Frances Small copied 
the portrait of Miss Kirkpatrick by George Romney. 

LIBRARY 

The gallery library continued to increase by gift, purchase, and 
subscription in volumes, pamphlets, periodicals, etc., Mr. J. Town- 
send Russell, jr., being the principal benefactor of the year.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 57 

Curatorial work within the collection has as usual included the 
documentary study of inscriptions on the new purchases fruni the 
Far East, as well as those upon objects already in the collection. 
Many objects and reproductions of objects have been submitted by 
other institutions and by private owners for expert opinion or for 
translation of inscriptions in Chinese, Japanese, or Tibetan. The 
total number of such reports made by tlie curator embraces 834 
objects and 185 photorjraphs of objects. 

Durin<r the winter a large group of paintings in the Near Eastern 
section, which was purchased en hloc in 1907 from its then owner, 
Col. H. B. Hanna, and which comprised a miscellany of Mughal, 
Rajput, and Persian paintings, has undergone complete revision and 
reclassification. In this work the curator has had the expert assist- 
ance of Dr. A. K. Coomara-swamy, of the Museum of Fine Arts, 
Boston. The entire collection of Near Eastern i)ainting and manu- 
script leaves is now in process of being remounted and stored in 
boxes of an iiupro\ed type made in the Freer Gallery shop for this 
pur]jose. The collection of Chinese bronzes, also, has been given 
a new and improved type of storage so arranged as to be most easily 
accessible to the student.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 59 

BUILDING 

The work of repairing the building has included this year the 
repainting of the corridors on the lower floor, and of Galleries III 
and IV. The shop has been constantly occupied with the building of 
equipment of various sorts, including new cases for bronze storage, 
other exhibition cases and easels, and, interesting for its novelty, a 
motor-driven machine for the unrolling of Chinese scrolls before a 
moving-picture camera. The report of the superintendent, which 
gives a detailed account of shop work, accompanies this report as 
Appendix C (not printed). 

ATTENDANCE 

The gallery has been open every day, from 9 until 4.30 o'clock, 
with the exception of Mondays, Christmas Day, and New Year's 
Day. 

Tlie total attendance for the year was 120,651; the total attendance 
for week days, 80,62-1; the total Sunday attendance, 40,027. The 
average Sunday attendance is more than twice as great as that of 
week days; 769 being the average Sunday attendance, and 310 the 
average for week days. The two peaks of the year were reached in 
August and April, with totals of 17,800 and 17,541, respectively; 
the lowest attemlance was that of January, with a total of 5,561. 

The total number of visitors to the offices was 1,349. Of these, 
156 came for general information; 172 to call upon upon members 
of the staff; 308 to see objects in storage; 110 to submit objects for 
examination; 16 to study the building and installation methods; 128 
to study in the library; 95 to see the reproductions of the Washington 
Manuscripts; 15 to nudce photographs and sketches, and 3 to make 
tracings; while 212 came to ]Hirchase photographs. 

Sixteen groups, ranging from 1 to 30 persons, were given docent 
service in the exhibition galleries, and 10 classes in groups ranging 
from 3 to 8 persons were given instruction in the study room. 

Two lectures by eminent authorities in their respective fields were 
given during the winter in the auditorium at the Freer Gallery. 
These were as follows : 

January 6, 1930: Sir Aurel Stein on " The Caves of the Thousand 
Buddhas"; illustrated. 

February 20, 1930: Dr. A. K. Coomaraswamy on "Indian Sculp- 
ture: Intention and Development"; illustrated.

the auditorium was opened to the society of "The Friends of Music 
in the Library of Congress," for a concert of music written for 
harpischord, piano, viola d'amore, and viola.

FIELJ) WORK 

In spite of greatly disturbed conditions now and long since pre- 
vailing in China, Mr. Bishop was able, last spring, to make investi- 
gations of considerable interest at the site of the Liang dynasty 
(A. D. 502-556) tombs, not far from Nanking. The detailed report 
on these excavations has not yet been received; but, meanwhile, 
copies of Mr. Bishop's letters from the field are submitted herewith 
as Appendix B (not printed). 

In June, after a profitable winter at the Imperial University, 
Kyoto, Mr. Wenley joined Mr. Bishop in China. He has been re- 
called for work at the gallery where he is due to arrive next 
December. 

Mr. Acker has been making excellent progress in his Chinese 
studies at the University of Leiden, and has also found opportunity 
to see some of the important Chinese collections in Paris, Berlin,

APPENDIX 4 
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY 

SiK : I liave the honor to submit the following report on the field 
researches, oflice work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri- 
can Ethnolo^'V during the fiscal year ended June 30, l'J30, conducted 
in accordance with the act of Congress approved February 20, 1929. 
The act referred to contains the following item : 

American t'tlmoloj,'.v : For continuing etlinological researches among the 
American Indians and tlie natives of Hawaii, the excavation and preservation 
of archeologic remains under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, 
including necessary employees, the preparation of manuscripts, drawings, and 
illustrations, ihe purchase' of books and periodicals, and traveling expenses, 
$68,800. 

Mr. M. W. Stirling, chief, in the month of August, 1929, visited 
Gallup. X. Mex.. from whence he went to the Long H Ranch. Ariz., 
in order to view the archeological excavations being conducted there 
by Dr. F. H. H, Roberts, jr., of the bureau staff. From the Long 
H Ranch he proceeded to Pecos, N. Mex., for the purpose of attend- 
ing the Conference of Southwest xVrcheologists, which was held at 
the site of the excavations being conducted by Dr. A, V. Kidder. 

From Pecos Mr. Stirling Avent to Hanover, N. H., to deliver an 
address before the annual meeting of the Social Science Research 
Council. 

On February 1 Mr. Stirling went to Key West, Fla., where, 
through tlie courtesy of Mr. Lee Pari.sh, he was enabled to conduct 
an archeological reconnaissance of the Ten Thousand Islands in 
Mr. Parish's yacht, the Esperanza. Upon the completion of this 
reconnaissance a visit was made to Lacooche, Fla., where a small 
mound was excavated. Mr, Stirling next proceeded to Tampa Bay, 
where a large sand mound near Safety Harbor was excavated. 

"Work was continued on the preparation of manuscript descriptive 
of the field work, and a number of short articles were prepared and 
publislied in various periodicals. Frequent lectures on anthropo- 
logical topics were given during the year before various scientific 
and educational bodies. 

Dr. John R. Swanton. ethnologi.st, conducted field work during 
July and August, 1929, in Mississippi and Oklahoma. He collected 
further ethnological material from the Mississippi Choctaw, and 

61 



62 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

corrected notes that were obtained the year before. In Oklahoma 
Doctor Swanton visited most of the existing Square Grounds of 
the Creeks, witnessed parts of several ceremonies, and obtained de- 
scriptions of their ceremonial arrangement. The Choctaw material 
has been incorporated in his manuscript, " Source Book for the 
Social and Ceremonial Customs of the Choctaw," which is ready for 
publication. The data Doctor Swanton collected on Creek Square 
Grounds will form a short paper and is ready for publication. 

Doctor Swanton corrected throughout the words of his Timucua 
dictionary, completing work begun last year ; and in addition he be- 
gan the work of translating them, with the help of the original 
Timucua-Spanish religious works in which the material is preserved. 
Further work was done on the map of Indian tribes, the scope of 
which has been extended so" as to cover Mexico, Central America, 
and the West Indies ; the accompanying text has also been amplified. 
On June 20 Doctor Swanton left Washington to resume field work 
in the State of Louisiana. 

On July 1, 1929, Dr. Ti-uman Michelson, ethnologist, went to 
Shawnee, Okla., to continue his study of the Algonquin Tribes of 
that State, where he obtained a fairly representative collection of 
Ivickapoo mythology. From these studies Doctor Michelson found 
that his statement made 14 years ago that Ivickapoo mythology, on 
the whole, is closest to Fox mythology, still holds valid. It should 
be mentioned that Kickapoo shares with certain northern Indian 
tribes a number of tales which are either absent from the Fox or 
their knowledge is confined to but few of them. Despite some sec- 
ondary changes, Kickapoo is an archaic Algonquian language. It 
may be added that their religious ideas and practices hold their own 
with great vigor. Obviously, the type of social organization is quite 
similar to those of the Sauk and Fox. Work among the Sauk and 
Shawnee was chiefly linguistic. The new data clearly show that 
Shawnee is further removed from Sauk, Fox, and Kickapoo than 
supposed; yet it is abundantly clear that it is closer to them than 
to any other Algonquian languages. Only a short time was given to 
Cheyenne, practically nothing but linguistics being considered. The 
opinion given by Doctor Michelson in the twenty-eighth annual re- 
port of the bureau that Cheyenne must be considered aberrant Al- 
gonquian is fully sustained. Some social customs were noted, among 
them male descent. Work among the Arapaho was mainly linguistic. 

A large part of the time in the office was spent in preparing for 
publication a large memoir on the Fox WapAnowiweni. This is now 
in an advanced stage of preparation. He also corrected the proofs 
of Bulletin 95 of the bureau which was issued during the year. 

On June 3, 1930, Doctor Michelson left Washington to renew his 
work among the Algonquin Tribes of Oklahoma. He spent at first a 



I 



KEPOBT OF THE SECRETARY 63 

short time on the Clieyenne. It is now possible to fornnilate some 
of the phonetic shifts that have transformed Cheyenne from normal 
Algonquian. It is also clear that some of the conmionest words in 
normal Algonquian are lacking. He then took up work again among 
the Kickapoo and obtained an even larger body of myths and tales. 
Some new facts on their social organization were likewise obtained. 

Mr. John P. Harrington, ethnologist, worked during the 3'ear se- 
curing tlie language and much of the ethnology of the San Juan 
tribe of California through an aged and ill informant, Mi's. Ascen- 
sion Solorsano, at Monterey, Calif. Having learned the language 
which has scarcely been spoken since 1850, through the circumstance 
that both her mother and father, who were fullblooded Indians, 
talked it together all their lives, the mother dying at 84 years of age 
and the father at 82, she retained a knowledge of an extinct language 
and a dead culture, and lived long enough to enable Mr. Harrington 
to record practically all that she knew, thus filling in a great blank in 
California ethnology. So sick that she was scarcel}' able to sit up 
even at the beginning of the work, Mr. Harrington continued this 
work at her bedside until well into January, 1930, and no Indian 
ever showed greater fortitude than this poor soul who served the 
bureau up to almost her last day. The material recorded consisted 
of every branch of linguistic and ethnological information and con- 
tains many new anil important features. 

Mrs. Solorsano during all the latter part of her life was recog- 
nized as a doctora. Her little home at Gilroy, Calif., was a free 
hospital for down-and-outs of every nationality and creed, and here 
the sick and ailing were treated witii Indian and Spanish herb medi- 
cines and were seen through to the last with motherly care and no 
thought of recompense. IMr. Harrington obtained full accounts of 
how she treated all the various diseases, and of the herbs and other 
metiiods employed. Specimens of the herbs were obtained and 
identified by the division of plants of the National jNIuseum. 

Songs were obtained on the phonograph, and accounts of cere- 
monies, and description of all the foods of the Indians and how 
they were cooked were obtained. Accounts of the witcheries of the 
medicine men take us back to earliest times, and are mingled with the 
early history of the tribe at the San Juan Mission. Many stories 
and anecdotes about early Indians were recorded and throw much 
light on the thought and the language of the times. Names of 
plants and animals and places were studied and identified. Dr. C. 
Hart Merriam generously helping in this and other sections of the 
work. In spite of her age and infirmities Dona Ascension's mind 
remained remarkably clear and her memory was exceptional. No 
greater piece of good fortune has ever attended cthnohjgical re- 
search of a tribe that was culturally of the greatest importance, 



64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

forming an all but lost link between the cultures of northern and 
southern California. 

After the death of Dona Ascension at the end of January, 1930, 
Mr. Harrington spent some weeks in checking up on the information 
in every way possible, copying from the archives at San Juan Mission, 
working at the Bancroft Library at Berkeley, Calif., and interview- 
ing many individuals, and returned to Washington in April, since 
which time he has been engaged in preparing a report on the work 
for publication. 

Dr. F. H. H. Roberts, jr., archeologist, devoted the fiscal year to a 
number of activities. July, August, and the first part of September, 
1929, were spent conducting excavations at the Long H Ranch, 
between St. John's and Houck, in eastern Arizona. The work was 
begun in May and continued through June of the preceding fiscal 
year so that the investigations extending from July to the middle of 
September were a continuation of work already under way. At the 
completion of the summer's work the remains of three different types 
of houses had been uncovered. These included 18 pit houses, the 
vestiges of three jacal, pole and mud structures, and a pueblo ruin 
with 49 rooms, and 4 kivas or circular ceremonial rooms. 

The pit houses were found to correspond in many respects with 
those dug up by Doctor Roberts in the Chaco Canyon, in north- 
western New Mexico, during the summer of 1927 and described in 
Bulletin 92 of the Bureau of American Ethnology. The jacal houses 
were found to have been quite comparable to a similar type found 
in southern Colorado during the field season of 1928. The latter 
were extensively described in Bulletin 96 of the bureau. The pueblo 
revealed an unusually clear cut story of the growth and changes 
in a communal dwelling. The building had not been erected ac- 
cording to a preconceived plan but had grown by degrees through the 
addition of new units. It was quite evident that such additions 
had taken place at four different periods in the occupation of the 
building. 

Doctor Roberts returned to Washington in October. The autumn 
months were devoted to reading and correcting galley and page 
proofs for the report on the investigations of the 1928 field season. 
This paper is called " Early Pueblo Ruins in the Piedra District, 
Southwestern Colorado," and is Bulletin 96 of the bureau. 

The winter months were devoted to working over the specimens 
obtained from the summer's excavations and preparing a report on 
the investigations. This included the drawing of 31 text figures, 
consisting of 70 drawings, 1 map showing the region in general 
and the location of the sites, and the writing of a 600-page manu- 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Go 

script. The latter is called "The Ruins at Kiatutlihiiiiia,"' the Zufii 
Indian name for the locality. 

Dorlor Koherts assisted Mr. Neil M. Judd of the Unitetl States 
National Museum in cataloguing? the collections made along the 
l*i('di-a Kivor in southwestern Colorado in the summer of li)28. 
lliustiated lectures on the archeology of the Southwest were ileliv- 
ered before a number of Washington organizations, and information 
on the archeology of the New World was suj)|)lied in response to 
many letters of incpiiry. 

On May 12, IDJJO, Doctor lloberts left Washington for Denver, 
(^olo.. where one week was spent in studying new accessions in the 
Colorado State Museum and (he City Museum of Denver. 

I-^eaving Denver, Doctor Roberts proceeded to Gallup, N. Mex., 
and from there to the Zufii Indian Reservation. One week was 
devoted to an archeological reconnaissance of the Zuni area. As a 
result of this a small pueblo ruin was chosen as the scene for inten- 
sive investigations, and under a permit from the Department of 
the Interior excavations were started. By July 1 a burial mound 
containing 40 interments had been investigated and 16 rooms and 
2 kivas or ceremonial chambers in the pueblo had been cleared of 
their accumulated debris. In addition to much valuable information, 
150 specimens, including pottery and other art facts, had been 
secured. 

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist, was engaged in routine office 
work from July 1, 1029, to May 7, 1930, and from the latter date 
until the close of the fiscal year he was engaged in field service in 
Canada and very briefly in New York State. 

Mr. Hewitt devoted much careful research among various docu- 
ments to ascertain, if possible, the symbolic significance of white 
and purple wampum beads, respectively, and also when these are 
mi.xed in definite proportions and arrangement on strings or belts; 
but much reading of documents which might bear on the question 
was comparatively barren of any satisfactory results. He was led 
to this study because, in modern time at least, strings of wampum 
function ami have functioned quite prominently in the public trans- 
actions of the Council of the League of the Iroquois. Wampum 
strings are an essential accompaniment in the use of the ritual of 
the Requickening Address of the Council of Condolence and Instal- 
lation of the League. 

Mr. Hewitt also transliterated an Ottawa mythic text from the 
common missionary alpliabet into that of the Powell phonetic system 
designed for the use of c<dlal)orators of the bureau. 

He also typed in native Mohawk text the chanted ritual, the 
Eulogy of the Founders of the League, as intoned by ihc Father 



66 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

Tribal Sisterhood, incorporating therein such revisional additions, 
textual and grammatic, as had been found necessary by extensive 
field studies. Mr. Hewitt also typed in native Onondaga text this 
ritual in the form in which it is intoned by the Mother Tribal Sister- 
hood ; these two versions of the eulogy differ chiefly in the introduc- 
tory paragraphs and also in the terms or forms of address. Mr. 
Hewitt continued to represent the Bureau of American Ethnology, 
Smithsonian Institution, on the United States Geographic Board, 
and as a member also of its executive committee. 

On the afternoon of May 7, 1930, Mr. Hewitt left Washington 
on field duty, returning to the bureau July 1. During this trip 
he visited the Grand River Reservation of the Six Nations of In- 
dians near Brantford, Canada, the Tuscarora Reservation near Ni- 
agara Falls, N. y., and the Onondaga Reservation near Syracuse, 
N. Y. Largely through his own knowledge of the several Iroquois 
languages, he was able to recover the hitherto lost meanings of sev- 
eral passages in the texts relating to the league. These recoveries 
now make the entire structure of the League of the Iroquois clear 
and consistent. 

During the fiscal year Dr. Francis LaFlesche, ethnologist, read 
the proof of his paper " The Osage Tribe : Rite of the Wa-xo-be," 
which will be publislied in the forty-fifth annual report of the 
bureau. At the time of Doctor LaFlesche's retirement, December 
26, 1929, he had nearly completed an Osage dictionary upon which 
he had been working for several years. 

SPECIAL KESEARCHES 

The music of 10 tribes of Indians has been studied during the 
past year by ISiiss Frances Densmore, a collaborator of the bureau, 
in continuance of her research on this subject. These tribes are the 
Acoma, Menominee, Winnebago, Yuma, Cocopa, Mohave, Yaqui, 
Makah, Clayoquot, and Quileute. The first tribe given considera- 
tion was the Acoma, the work consisting in a completion of the 
study of records made in Washington by Philip Sanche. These 
records were made for the chief of the Bureau of American Eth- 
nology. Thirteen were transcribed as representative of the series. 
An outstanding peculiarity of these songs is a gradual raising or 
lowering of the pitch during a performance. In some instances 
the pitch was changed a semitone, in others a tone and a half, and 
one example contained a rise of a whole tone during one minute of 
singing. This was regarded as a mannerism and. the song was 
transcribed on the pitch maintained for the longest time. 

The work on Yuman and Yaqui music consisted in the retyping of 
almost all the text on these tribes, made necessary by the combining 



REPOltT OF THE SKCRETATJY 67 

of individual luauuscripts iiiio u book. The analysis of each sou'i 
was ^ciutini'/ed and several sonj^s ])revioiisly classed as "' ii re;^Miliir 
in tonality" Avere otherwise classitied. The ^preparation for })\ilili- 
cation of a book on Menominee music has been practically com- 
pleted. The nianiis(.'rii)t contains IGO pa<res, witli transcriptions of 
140 songs, and a large number of illustrations. The nuUerial col- 
lected at Neah Bay, Wash., and submitted in the form of 13 manu- 
scripts during previous years, has been unified under chapter 
headings and retyi)ed for publication. Interesting features of these 
songs are the prominence of the tetrachord and the large number of 
songs with a compass of three or four tones. 

In July and August, iy'21), a held trip was made to the Menominee 
and Winnebago in Wisconsin, the former tribe receiving the more 
consideration. This was the third visit to the iMenominec and work 
was done at Keshena, Xeopit, and Zoar. In June, 1930, another trip 
was made to the Winnebago in Wisconsin, this being the fourth visit 
to that tribe. Songs were recorded in the vicinity of Tomah and 
also near Wisconsin Ilapids. One of the singers at the former 
locality was Paul Decora, whose home is in Nebraska. Fourteen 
songs were recorded by this singer and found to contain the same 
changes of pitch which marked the performance of the Acoma 
singer. In some songs the ])itch was steadily maintained, while in 
others it was gradually raised or lowered a semitone during the lir.-t 
rendition, the remainder of the performance being on the new pitch. 
John Smoke is an industrious Winnebago farmer, who retains a 
''water-spirit bundle" inherited from his ancestors and uses it in 
a ceremonial manner. He allowed Miss Densmoie to see this l)undle, 
explained its use and benefits, and recorded two of its songs which 
are sung when its contents are exposed to view. A Winnebago flute 
player known as Frisk Cloud recorded three melodies on a flute 
made of metal pipe, and said " the love songs are words put to flute 
melodies." He is also a maker of flutes and described the measure- 
ments of an instrument in terms of hand and finger widths and 
hand spreads. Miss Densmore purchased the instrument on which 
the melodies had been played. 

Winnebago songs and another flute j)crformance were recorded 
by George Monegar, a blind man living near Wisconsin Rapids, who 
is considered one of the best' authorities on old customs. He also 
related the legend of the origin of the flute. 

Songs of 10 classes w'ere recorded on this trip, willi old and mod- 
ern examples of one class. The recorded songs comprise those of 
the water-spirit bundle, hand game, and moccasin game, love songs, 
war songs, and a lullaby, and .songs of the Green Corn, Friendship, 
Fortynine, and Squaw dances. 



68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

At the suggestion of Senator Carl Hayden, Mr. Neil M. Judd, 
curator of archeology in the United States National Museum, made 
a brief reconnaissance in September, 1929, for the purpose of ascer- 
taining the most practicable method of surveying, at this late date, 
the prehistoric canal systems of the Gila and Salt River Valleys, 
Ariz. Most of the ancient canals had been obliterated through agri- 
cultural practices; others were threatened with early destruction 
under the program of the Coolidge Dam project. Following his 
preliminary investigation, he recommended an aerial survey as the 
only feasible means whereby the former aboriginal canal systems 
could be located and mapped for permanent record. 

Since haste was a prime factor, in view of the extensive grading 
operations within the Pima Indian Reservation, the War Depart- 
ment generously came to the aid of the Smithsonian Institution by 
providing an observation plane and personnel. Mr. Judd left Wash- 
ington January 12, 1930, and proceeded to Phoenix, Ariz., by way 
of Tucson and Sacaton. Unfavorable flying conditions served to 
delay inauguration of the survey. Ground haze in the early morn- 
ing and smoke in the afternoon obscured the ground except for a 
2-hour period at mid-day. Lieut. Edwin Bobzien, pilot, and Sergt. 
R. A. Stockwell, photographer, both from Crissj^ Field, the Presidio, 
San Francisco, pursued their assigned tasks as rapidly as possible. 
They made approximately 700 exposures, of which half were vertical 
photographs taken from an altitude of 10,000 feet. These have 
since been assembled into mosaic maps. As was anticipated, the 
aerial survey disclosed numerous prehistoric canals not visible from 
the ground, Witli the mosaic maps in hand these ancient canals 
must now be examined individually and their locations identified 
with reference to nearby section lines. This task properly should 
be done during the late autumn or winter months and within the next 
few years. 

Without the personal interest of Senator Hayden and the cooper- 
ation of the War Department, the Smithsonian Institution would 
have found it impossible to undertake the aerial survey above 
mentioned. 

In late November, 1929, and again in early May, 1930, Mr. Judd 
made brief visits to Charlottesville, Va., there to advise with Mr. 
D. I. Bushnell, jr., in those investigations of nearby Indian village 
sites he is pursuing in behalf of the bureau. 

EDITORIAL WORK AND PUBLICATIONS 

The editing of the publications of the bureau was continued 
through the year by Mr. Stanley Searles, editor, assisted by Mrs. 
Frances S. Nichols, editorial assistant. The status of the publica- 
tions is presented in the following summary.

Miscellaneous publications 648 

Total 24,868 

As compared with the fiscal year ended June 30, 1929, there was 
an increase of 4,75G publications distributed, due in part to the 
large number of separates from the Handbook of American Indians 
sent to Camp Fire Girls. After revision, the mailing list now 
stands at 1,627.

LIBRARY 

The reference library has continued under the care of Miss Ella 
Lear}'^, librarian, assisted by Mr. Thomas Blackwell. 

The library consists of 29,071 volumes, about 16,527 pamphlets, 
and several thousand unbound periodicals. During the year 559 
books were accessioned, of which 109 were acquired by purchase 
and 450 by gift and exchange; also 150 pamphlets, and 4,106 serials, 
chiefly the publications of learned societies, were received and re- 
corded, of which 110 were obtained by purchase, the remainder being 
received through exchange. The catalogue was increased by the 
addition of 3,420 cards. Volumes to the number of 210 were collated 
and prepared for binding. Numerous loans were made to libraries in 
Washington, and a considerable amount of reference work was done 
in the usual course of the library's service to investigators and stu- 
dents, both those in the Smithsonian Institution and others. The 
purchase of books and periodicals for the library has been restricted 
to such as relate to the bureau's researches. 

Many volumes received by the library not pertaining to anthro- 
pology were transferred to the library of the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion. During the year the cataloguing has been carried on as new 
accessions were acquired and good progress was made in cataloguing 
ethnologic and related articles in the earlier serials. The number 
of books borrowed from the Library of Congress for the use of the 
staff of the bureau in prosecuting their researches was about 150.

Mr. Anthony W. Wilding, clerk. Miss Mae W. Tucker, stenog- 
rapher, was engaged in completing the catalogue of phonograph 
records of Indian music, copying manuscripts for Doctor Swanton 
and in assisting Mr. Hewitt in his work as custodian of manuscripts 
and phonograph records. Mrs. Frances S. Nichols assisted tlie 
editor. 

During the course of the year information was furnished by mem- 
bers of the staff in reply to numerous inquiries concerning the Norfh 
American Indian peoples, both past and present, and the Mexican 
peoples of the prehistoric and early historic periods to the south. 
Various specimens sent to the bureau were identified and data on 
them furnished for their owners.

APPENDIX 5 
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE 

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the 
operations of the International Exchange Service during the fiscal 
year ending June 30, 1930: 

For the support of the system of International Exchanges Con- 
gress appropriated $51,297, an increase of $942 over the amount 
granted for the preceding year. This extra amount was requested 
to cover the added cost for freight due to the increase in the weight 
of shipments sent abroad. The repayments from governmental and 
other establishments aggregated $5,050.30, making the total resources 
available for carrying on the Exchange Service during 1930, 
$56,347.30. 

The total number of packages received both from domestic and 
foreign sources for distribution through the service was 694,665, 
an increase over the previous year of 74,180, or about 12 per cent. 
The weight of these packages was 708,094 pounds, a gain of 86,721 
pounds, or nearly 14 per cent. These increases are quite out of 
the ordinary, especially when it is considered that the gain in 
packages during the preceding year was one of the largest in the 
history of the service. 

The publications sent and received by the Exchange Service are 
classified as parliamentary documents, departmental documents, and 
miscellaneous scientific and literary publications. The term " Par- 
liamentary documents," as here used, refers to publications set aside 
by law for exchange with foreign governments, and includes not 
only documents printed by order of either House of Congress, but 
those issued by any department, bureau, or commission of the 
Government not of a confidential nature. The returns for these 
publications are deposited in the Library of Congress. The term 
" Departmental documents " embraces all of the publications de- 
livered at the Institution from the various Government departments, 
bureaus, or commissions, for distribution to correspondents abroad 
from whom they desire to obtain similar publications in exchange. 
The " Miscellaneous scientific and literary publications " are re- 
ceived chiefly from learned societies, universities, colleges, scientific 
organizations, and museums. The number and weight of packages 
coming under these different headings are as follows :

It will be seen from the foregoing table that 74 per cent of the 
work of the office has been conducted in behalf of the United States 
governmental establishments. 

There were shipped abroad during the year 3,235 boxes, being an 
increase of 412 (14.6 per cent) over the number for the preceding 
12 months. This is the largest number of boxes forwarded abroad 
through the service in one year. These boxes measured a total of 
17,034 cubic feet. Seven hundred and eighty-five of the boxes con- 
tained full sets of United States official documents for authorized 
depositories and the remainder (2,450) were filled with departmental 
and other publications for depositories of partial sets and for miscel- 
laneous correspondents. The number of boxes sent to each country

'74 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 

In addition to the packages forwarded abroad in boxes, 67,945— 
an increase over last year of 7,089 — were sent to their destinations 
direct by mail. About one-third of these packages contained copies 
of the daily issue of the Congressional Record, which, under treaty 
stipulations and by authority of Congress, are mailed directly to 
the depositories immediately upon publication. The remainder of 
the packages were partly for remote places which could not be 
reached through existing agencies and partly for countries for which 
the accumulations were so small at the scheduled forwarding dates 
that it was more economical to send them by mail than by freight. 

Almost since the establishment of the Smithsonian system of ex- 
changes in 1850, consignments received from abroad have, at the 
request of the Institution, been addressed in care of the collector of 
customs at the port of New York, consignments so addressed being 
admitted duty free and without examination. Up to July 1, 1923, 
an official of the United States customhouse attended to the entry 
and transmission to Washington of shipments arriving at the port 
of New York for the Smithsonian Institution. On that date the 
coordinator of the second area assumed charge of the handling of all 
shipments for the Institution, both incoming and outgoing. How- 
over, as the foreign agencies had for so many years been accustomed 
to addressing boxes to the Institution in care of the Collector of 
Customs, no change in that regard was made until shortly before the 
close of the current fiscal year, when the various foreign exchange 
bureaus were requested to address all future shipments to the Insti- 
tution as follows : 

Smithsonian Institution, 

Washington, D. C. 

Care Coordinator, Second Area. 

Custoruhouse, New York City, U. S. A. 

During the year nine boxes of exchanges from Germany were de- 
stroyed when the steamship Munchen sunk while unloading at her 
pier in New York, the sinking of the vessel having been caused by an 
explosion which resulted in a fire. These boxes contained publica- 
tions for distribution to various addresses in the United States and 
German patent specifications for the United States Patent Office, 
Boston Public Library, Chicago Public Library, and St. Louis Pub- 
lic Library. An effort is being made to obtain duplicate copies of 
the lost publications. 

As an example of the use made of the facilities of the International 
Exchange Service other than in transporting packages, reference is 
made to a request from Adelbert College Library, Cleveland, Ohio, 
for information concerning the Bulletin of "Works published by the 
Station of Aquiculture and Fisheries of Castiglione, a communica- 
tion regarding the matter addressed to the station itself by the

by this office throiifjh the French Exchange Bureau, and in the 
library's letter of acknowledgment to the Institution it is stated that 
''the information, which had been impossible for us to obtain, is 
just what we need.'' 

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS 

A convention for the international exchange of oflicial documents 
and scientific and literary publications was concluded at Brussels 
March 15, 1886, between the United States and certain other coun- 
tries. In accordance with the terms of that convention and under 
authority of resolutions of Congress setting apart a certain number 
of documents for exchange with foreign governments, there now 
are sent regularly to dei)ositories abroad (')2 full sets of United States 
official publications and 47 partial sets, an increase of four sets dur- 
ing the year. China, Assam, Bihar and OrLssa, Central Provinces, 
and the Punjab were added to the list of those countries receiving 
partial sets, and the set sent to Lourenc^o Marquez was discontinued. 

The depository in Austria has been changed from tlic Bundesamt 
fiir Statistik to the Bnndeskanzleramt, Horrengasse 23, Vienna I; 
the one in Bolivia from the Ministerio de Colonizacion y Agricultura 
to the Biblioteca del II. Congreso Nacional, La Paz; the one in 
Hesse, Germany, from the Landesbibliothek, Darmstadt, to the 
Universitiits-Bibliothek, Giessen; and the one in Honduras from the 
Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores to the Biblioteca y Archivo

INTERPARLIAMENTARY EXCHANGE OF THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL 

In 1909 Congress, ^n order to more fully carry into effect the 
provisions of the exchange convention concluded at Brussels in 1886, 
passed a resolution setting aside a certain number of copies of the 
daily issue of the Congressional Record for exchange, through the 
Smithsonian Institution, with such foreign governments as may 
agree to send to the United States current copies of their parliamen- 
tary record or like publication, the returns to be deposited in the 
Library of Congress. Since the passage of that resolution many 
countries have entered into this exchange, 102 copies of the Record 
now being sent abroad, one new depository — Colonial Secretary, 
Belize, British Honduras — having been added during the year. 

The depositories of the Record in San Jose, Costa Rica; Port-au- 
Prince, Haiti; and Belgrade, Yugoslavia, have been discontinued 
and the following have been added: "A Federagao," Porto Alegre, 
Brazil; Ufficio degli Studi Legislativi, Rome, Italy; Library of the 
l^ersian Parliament, Teheran, Persia. The depository in Madrid, 
Spain has been changed to Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional. 

A complete list of the States taking part in this immediate ex- 
change, together with the names of the establishments to whom the 
Record is mailed, is given below :

APPENDIX 6 
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK 

Sir : I have the honor to submit the following report on the oper- 
ations of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal jestr ending 
June 30, 1930 : 

The regular appropriation made by Congress for the maintenance 
of the park was $203,000, an increase of $7,450 over 1929. In addi- 
tion an appropriation of $220,000 was provided for the construction 
of a reptile house. The completion of this building has been made 
possible by the addition of $28,000 to the regular 1931 appropria- 
tion. The first deficiency act provided $2,000 for the construction of 
a gate to close at night a new road leading into the south portion of 
the park by Rock Creek. 

On February 8, 1930, the Zoo suffered a severe loss in the death of 
Mr. A. B. Baker, who for more than 39 years had been assistant di- 
rector. To Mr. Baker's great loyalty as well as his profound knowl- 
edge of zoological park management is due to a large extent the de- 
velopment of the National Zoological Park. His death takes away 
not only a good friend but a most valued official. He was succeeded 
by Mr. Ernest P. Walker, formerly senior biologist of the Biological 
Survey, who had recently been engaged in the game and bird 
reservation work conducted by that bureau. 

ACCESSIONS 

Gifts. — The collection this year has been greatly benefited by 
gifts, some of them of rare and unusual specimens obtained on ex- 
peditions. 

Dr. Paul Bartsch brought home with him from South America 
and the West Indies 6 iguanas, 10 South American tortoises, and 
50 hermit crabs. 

Mr. Fred Carnochan, of New York, returned from East Africa 
with a rare white-thighed colobus, a Schwineforth chimpanzee, and 
a Killimbira guenon. This last was obtained from M. de Frey- 
gang of Urundi, and is the first of its kind to be exhibited in the 
United States. 

Mr. Stephen Haweis brought from Dominica four giant toads and 
half a dozen large edible frogs of this island, locall}^ called ""moun- 
tain chickens." 
84 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 85 

Dr. H. C. Kellers, United States Navy, who accompanied the 
astronomical expedition to the Philippines, returned with a lar<re 
shipment of snakes, lizards, birds, and small mammals. 

Mr. W. ^r. Perry^o of the United States National Museum, on an 
expedition to Haiti, secured a large collection, of which six rhinoceros 
iguan:is and two Haitian boas were the most interesting to the Zoo, 
though some of the small snakes that he collected may ])rove to be 
new species. 

Hon. Gifford Pinchot, who cruised the Pacihc on a notable expedi- 
tion, brought home with him for the National Zoological Park a 
specimen of the almost extinct Duncan Island tortoise, a Hood 
Island tortoise, four Albemarle tortoises, and three land iguanas, all 
from the Galai)agos. These are very important additions and make 
the collection of giant tortoises one of the finest. 

Through Tlieodore Roosevelt, jr., Harold S. Coolidge, jr., and 
Kalph Wheeler, of the Kelly-Koosevelt expedition, were presented 
a trio of white-faced gibbons, father, mother, and child, all magnifi- 
cent specimens; a rare Bay Bamboo rat; a sun bear; a Himalayan 
bear; as well as several smaller specimens. 

Mr. Fo.ster H. Benjamin of the United States Department of Agri- 
culture, who has been engaged in field work in connection with 
the extermination of the fruit fly in Florida, has kept a constant 
lookout for reptiles, and through liim there has been obtained a 
notable collection of Florida species, including many desirable 
specimens. 

Mr. O. Hallson, Bethel, Alaska, througli the Alaska Game Com- 
mission and the United States Biological Survey, sent three pairs of 
the rare Emperor goose, and Mr. E. R. Kalmbach of the United States 
Biological Survey secured on a western trip a collection of 31 assorted 
birds, including 5 Caspian terns. 

The United Fruit Co., through Mr. Samuel Kress of Costa Rica, 
has continued its interest and ])resented a fine pair of Costa Rican 
deer, a collared peccary, and an Imperial boa. 

Through the Walter P. Chrysler fund was purchased a specimen 
of the very rare saddle-bill stork of West Africa, one of the most 
striking of living birds. This bird was captured by the Viennese 
explorer Weidholz, and was acclimatized in Vienna and afterwards 
in Nice. 

DONORS 

Mr. EuKene L. Abbott, Wnsliinjrton, D. C, alllpator. 
Mr. H. W. Armculrout, Washington, D. C, 6 opossums.

Purchases and exchanges. — Anion*; the most important purcliases 
during the year were a pair of maccaroni penguins, four pairs of 
birds of paradise (Wilson's, Magnificent, King, and 12-wired), a 
golden headed mynah, a pair of spectacled owls, and a pair of 
European eagle owls, the last two being from the estate of Spedan 
Lewis, the noted English aviculturist; and an imperial parrot se- 
cured in Dominica through Mr. Stephan Haweis. 

A pigmy hippopotamus was bought as a mate to the one already 
in the collection, and a male Molucca deer was also bought for the 
same purpose. The zoo purchased a pair of sea lions to replace 
those that died last year; a pair of jaguars, which have been lacking 
in our collection ; and a black jaguar. The last is the third of its 
kind to come to the United States, and is an exceedingly rare and 
beautiful specimen. 

Important animals received in exchange during the year were a 
pair of Molucca deer, and two pairs of axis deer, three keas, and a 
rare wallaroo. 

REMOVALS 

The most serious loss to the collection was that of old Mom, the 
female hippopotamus, who had been at the Park for 19 years, and 
during that time had given birth to seven young, five of which were 
raised. 

Causes of death. — When it has been thought that determination of 
the cause of death of certain animals might be useful, the specimens 
have been submitted to the Pathological Division of the Bureau of 
Animal Industry for examination. The following list shows the 
results of the autopsies : 

MAMMALS 

Carnlvora : Hemorrhagic septicemia, 1 ; chronic pneumonia, L 
Pinnipedia: Gastritis, 1. 
Primates: Intestinal parasites, 1.

Even casual observation of the cars parked in the zoo gives a fair 
cross section of the visiting j^ublic, but many of the local cars visit- 
ing the zoo from the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia 
carry visitors from distant States and from remote parts of the 
world. 

The National Zoological Park serves a higher and more important 
function than that which is most commonly attributed to it. In ad- 
dition to being a place for recreation and entertainment, it is an 
important and unique educational institution. It is unique in that it 
is a place of study for all ages and degrees of scholarship, from the 
young child to the veteran naturalist and research man. 

Its accumulated data on animals handled over a period of 40 years 
are constantly referred to. Facts learned regarding animals in the 
zoo often have a very practical application in other fields of activity. 

The beginner in zoology gains at the zoo a grasp of the differences 
and likenesses between animals, while he rubs shoulders with the 
advanced medical man studying the primates to help him in solving 
problems concerned with the health of mankind. The study of para- 
sites and diseases of wild animals in the zoo assists students of para- 
sites and diseases of man and domestic animals in their researches. 
In short, the National Zoological Park as a laboratory is probably of 
even greater value to the American people than it is as a recreational 
area. 

IMPROVEMENTS 

A contract was let for the construction of the reptile house, and the 
work was started in March, 1930. This building promises to be one 
of the finest of its kind in the world. It will allow the zoo for the 
first time in its history to maintain a collection of cold-blooded verte- 
brates as well as certain invertebrates. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 101 

During the year many minor improvements have been made in 
connection witli usual maintenance o[)erations. A new type of label 
is being tried out, and the less legible of the older type are being 
replaced as raj)idly as possible by the new style. 

Tiie American waterfowl pond was cleaned by hydraulioking, 
which restored it to a very satisfactory condition. 

The destruction of the old bird house may be considered one of the 
greatest improvements the park has made in years, but it greatly 
reduced the housing facilities and no attem])t at all has been made 
to obtain quantities of specimens of the smaller birds and mannnals 
even to replace those lost during the year. There being no empty 
cages to fill, the zoo has been able to pick and choose in making i)ur- 
chases, so that at the present time the collection contains a great 
number of interesting rarities, including a number of species unique 
in American collections. 

NEEDS OF THE ZOO 

Quarters for animals remain the most urgent need of the park. 
The greatest need is for a house in which can be displayed repre- 
sentatives of the large and very interesting group of small mammals. 
The need for such a house has previousl}' been emphasized. 

The National Zoological Park is second to none in natural beauty, 
and its building program is planned to conserve this by means of 
constructing a few large, capacious exhibition buildings instead of 
more numerous small ones, each of the new buildings to house several 
groups of animals. 

Hence, in the small-mammal house it is proposed to provide quar- 
ters also for the great apes. The park has an excellent collection 
of these, but the}' are now housed in such small cages that they do 
not appear to the best advantage and can be seen by comparatively 
few people at one time. 

The fire department of Washington has investigated the fire-pre- 
vention facilities in the park and finds that the fire hazards are very 
great on account of inadequate water mains and equipment. Expan- 
sion of the water system is therefore very urgently needed as a 
protection against fire and at tlie same time to augment the park's 
inadequate regular supply. 

It is now 40 years since the park was established. Much of the 
woodwork and ironwork in buildings and enclosures constructed in 
the earlier days, and even comparatively recently, has deteriorated 
from natural causes and from the unusual conditions present in the

APPENDIX 7 

REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY 

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi- 
ties of the Astrophysical Observatory for the fiscal year ended June 
30, 1930: 

PLANT AND OBJECTS 

This observatory operates regularly the central station at Wash- 
ington and two field stations for observing solar radiation on Table 
Mountain, Calif., and Mount Montezuma, Chile. The station at 
Mount Brukkaros, South West Africa, which was established by 
the National Geographic Society, is being continued for the present 
in cooperation with the Astrophysical Observatory with funds donated 
by a friend of the Institution. In addition, the observatory controls 
a station on Mount Wilson, Calif., where occasional expeditions are 
sent for special investigations. 

The principal aim of the observatory is the exact measurement of 
the intensity of the radiation of the sun as it is at mean solar distance 
outside the earth's atmosphere. This is ordinarily called the solar 
constant of radiation, but the observations of past years by this ob- 
servatory have proved it variable. As all life, as well as the weather, 
depends on solar radiation, the observatory has undertaken the con- 
tinued measurement of solar variation on all available days. These 
measurements have now continued all the year round for 11 years. 
As will appear in this report, recent studies indicate that the perma- 
nent continuation of these daily solar-radiation measurements may 
have great value for weather forecasting. In addition to this princi- 
pal object, the observatory undertakes spectroscopic researches on 
radiation and absorption of atmospheric constituents, radiation of 
special substances such as water vapor, ozone, carbonic-acid gas, 
liquid water, and others, and the radiation of the other stars as well 
as of the sun. 

WORK AT WASHINGTON 

Continuous series of solar observations having been made as 
hitherto at several field stations on desert mountains in distant lands, 
these observations have been critically studied and prepared for pub- 
lication at Washington. Several new investigations based on these 
obwrvations hnvo hpon ninde dui'infr thn year.

104 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

(a) Reductiort> of observations. — The observers in the field at 
Montezuma, Chile, completely reduce their measurements according 
to a definitive system adopted several years ago. Telegrams in code 
arriving daily from Montezuma are decoded and furnished about 24 
hours after observing to the United States Weather Bureau, which 
publishes the solar constant values on the Washington daily weather 
map. It is planned to include these results also in a broadcast of 
miscellaneous geophysical data to begin in July, 1930, under the 
auspices of Science Service. 

The variations of solar radiation seldom range beyond 3 per cent, 
yet, as will appear below, they seem to produce important weather 
changes even when as small as 0.5 per cent. It is only at high-altitude 
stations under very tranquil sky conditions that results of sufficient 
accuracy to display these small solar variations are to be obtained. 
Although visibly excellent, our station at Table Mountain, Calif, 
(longitude 117° 41' W., latitude 34° 22' N., altitude 7,500 feet), as 
yet fails to give results of equal consistency to those of the station 
of Montezuma. A thorough rereduction of all the Table Mountain 
observations, 1925 to 1930, has been completed, with great labor, 
during the past fiscal year. But it is disappointing. Fluctuations 
too evidently produced by the haziness or humidity of the atmosphere 
still are found occasionally in magnitudes of the order of 2 per cent. 
Accordingly, a new method of reduction designed to more effectively 
allow for these atmospheric changes was being developed at the close 
of the period covered by this report. Preliminary results by it seemed 
more promising. Reduction of Mount Brukkaros observations is 
being postponed until the success of this new method is tested for 
Table Mountain. 

(6) Atmospheric ozone. — As stated in last year's report, one 
troublesome feature of the Table Mountain work has but lately 
come to light through the studies of Fowle and of Dobson. It ap- 
pears that a variation of large percentage occurs in the quantity of 
atmospheric ozone prevailing at very high levels above Table Moun- 
tain. Fortunately only about one-fifth as much change of ozone 
occurs above Montezuma. The change occurring above Table Moun- 
tain is sufficient, if uncorrected for, to introduce nearly 1 per cent 
change in the results on the solar constant of radiation, but the 
corresponding effect at Montezuma is negligible. 

We were not aware of this source of error when the Table Moun- 
tain station was first occupied. It was not until several years after 
the work began that we introduced there Dobson's method of meas- 
uring ozone. Hence, if ozone corrections to solar constant values 
were to be made from 1925 on, daily, and not merely by averages, 
as suggested in last year's report, it became necessary to discover a 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 



105 



method whereby the correction could be computed from our daily 
solar constant observation themselves. This has been done. 

Figure 1 shows a portion of the solar energy curve observed at 
airmass 2.0. The ozone absorption occurs between places 20 and 20 
of this curve, but is barely, if at all, visually discernible thereon, 
even when ozone is most prevalent. However, its etl'ects can be 
made both discernible and measurable by the following simple pro- 
cedure. If we take half a dozen of the best days observed in autumn, 
when the ozone is near its minimum amount, and compute the mean 
values of the heights of the energy curve in the blue, green, yellow, 
and red we obtain thereby standard values proportional to the dis- 




FlouKc 1. — Solar energy curve In the region of absorption by atmospheric ozone 

tribution of energy in this region. Those standard values, as thus 
extended from the violet of the spectrum to the red, overlap at 
each end the ozone region. Next consider the observations of the 
heights of the energy curve at these selected places on any given day 
of observation. We divide them by the standard values just referred 
to and the result is a series of ratios, near unity, but tending some- 
times to be lower in the violet than in the red, or vice versa. If 
plotted against the spectrum place-numbers, these ratios may lie 
nearly in straight lines. But if the ozone content of the atmosphere 
on the day examined is different, being larger or smaller, than that 
of the average of the standard days, then the ratio plot just described 
presents a loop below or above that straight line which is fixed by 



106 



ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 



the unaffected spectrum regions in the violet and the red. These 
facts are illustrated in Figure 2. 

The deviation from the straight-line plots of these energy spectrum 
ratios becomes, then, a measure of the ozone contents of the higher

FiGUUjj 2. — Graph for measuring absorption by atmospheric ozone 

atmosphere. The results have been so reduced by us as to give the 
percentage corrections for ozone absorption to be applied to our 
solar-constant values on all days of observation at Table Mountain. 
These corrections apply only to the so-called " short method " of 
observation. The long method takes cognizance of the ozone absorp- 
tion in another way. 

By the generosity of a friend of the Institution we are preparing 
to send an expedition to Table Mountain in September, 1930, to

(c) Solar variati^m aiid temperature changes. — Obviously the 
weather depends on tlie sun. If the sun's emission of radiation 
varies, then the weather must change in some measure on that ac- 
count. Havinjjf six consecutive years of daily observations of solar 
variation, made and reduced in the most exact \sx\y at Montezuma, 
tlie variations have been compared with temperature changes in 
Washington, Williston, and Yuma. 

Figure 3 shows the sohir radiation measurements at Montezuma 
since 1924. Satisfactory, nearly satisfactory, and unsatisfactory ob- 
servations are indicated thereon by circles, crosses, and points, re- 
spectively. In passing, I draw attention to the facts that the results

FiGURK 4. — Solar changes and associated teniporaluie chaiigt-s at Wasbington 

average higher in 1924 and 1925 than in 1929, but return to higher 
values during the summer of 1930. Also the years 1924, 1926, and 
1028, are more affected by long range variations than 1925, 1927, and 
1929. This fact tends to verify the 2-year period of solar variation 
to which I drew attention in last year's report. 

What I now particularly note are the numerous cases of sequences 
of ascending and descending solar radiation values, occupying about 
4 days per sequence. These are indicated by curved full and dotted 
lines respectively in Figure 3. There are 98 cases of ascending and 
91 ca.ses of descending sequences thus indicated. If it had been pos- 
sible to observe on all days, there would probably have been nearly 
twice as many such sequences. I have omitted cases where the 



108 



ANNUAL EEPOKT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 



change was less than 0.4 per cent in the solar constant value, and also 
have omitted cases dependini^ on isolated or unsatisfactory values. 

Corresponding to each of these 189 cases I have tabulated the mean 
temperature of Washington, Williston. and Yuma, for a 9-day period, 
of which the day of culmination of the solar change is the fifth or 
central day. Taking each month of the year by itself, I have com- 
puted the average march of temperature over such 9-day intervals. 
In illustration, I gave Tables 1 and 2, showing the Washington tem- 
perature results of March, and Figure 4, which shows, at A, B, C, 
and D, the mean values for March, May, July, and October. There 
is given at E the average changes of solar radiation values corre- 
sponding thereto. 

There are several reversals of sign of the average temperature 
effects during the year. In Figure 5, 1 give a study of these changes 



JANUAWr FCBmM^Y 




Figure ,5. — Inversions of temperature dependence on solar variations 

of sign at Washington. All the cases have been arranged in con- 
secutive order of days throughout the year, irrespective of what 
year they occurred. The 98 cases corresponding to ascending se- 
quences are given in Diagram F, and those corresponding to descend- 
ing sequences in Diagram G. The quantity which is plotted is the 
difference of temperature between that of the day of culmination of 
solar change and that of four days previous. To guide the eye as 
to the prevailing trend of the results, a zigzag line connects the 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 109 

separate points. The area it includes over the line of zero depar- 
tures is crosshatchcd. Obviously the Dia^^ram F has a preponder- 
ance of crosshatched area below the zero line, and the Diafijram G 
above. Yet in April, and from June to mid-November, these aspects 
tend to reverse themselves in each diagram. To bring out this char- 
acteristic more plainly, I give in each diagram curves made by 
taking 5-case consecutive moans. That is, the mean is taken of cases 
1 to 5, 2 to 7, 3 to 8, and so on. As it seemed clear that such a curve 
in Diagram G is nearly the reverse of that in Diagram F, I have 
inverted the 5-day mean curve of G as the dotted curve in F. The 
correlation coefficient between the full and dotted curves in F is 
50 ±5 per cent. 

Results are found for Yuma and AVilliston similar to those pre- 
sented for AVashington. Though the types of elfect do not occur in 
identical months at the three stations, the magnitudes and tendencies 
are much the same.

112 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

From all this I conclude : 

1. An apparent influence of short-period solar variation appears* 
in the temperature of the United States. 

2. Corresponding to 0.8 per cent change in the sun, there appear 
to be temperature changes of the order of 5° F. at Washington. 

3. The sign of the correlation changes during the year. 

4. A high negative correlation is found between the temperaturt 
effects corresponding respectively to rising and to falling solar 
sequences. 

5. The temperature effects coincide in date with the solar changejj 
which appear to induce them. 

6. If the connection between solar change and temperature change 
is a genuine one, it must operate by some indirect atmospheric mech- 
anism; because if it were a direct effect its sign would not change 
.during the year. 

7. Although complicated, the relation seems to offer promise for 
weather forecasting nearly a week in advance. Yet the occasional 
inversions of effect found inspire caution in a pronouncement of this 
character. These apparent inversions are, however, doubtless caused 
frequently by one solar change treading too quickly on the heels of 
another. Again they may sometimes be caused by delayed receipt 
from distant centers of action of waves of temperature effect arising 
from former solar changes. 

The results thus far are tentative. It is proposed to study baro- 
metric pressures as well as temperatures and to extend the investiga- 
tion to other parts of the United States and of the world. Prelim- 
inary studies have been made, too, of 10-day mean values of solar 
radiation and temperature, and we hope that in this way, if reliable 
weather- forecasting data are really secured, they may be extended to 
months and seasons in advance. 

FIELD STATIONS 

Observations of the solar radiation have been continued whenever 
weather conditions would permit at Table Mountain, Calif., at 
Mount Montezuma, Chile, and at Mount Brukkaros, South West 
Africa. All three stations continue to report measurements as made 
on three-quarters of the days of the year or more. However, not all 
of these observations prove satisfactory, so that 60 per cent is a bet- 
ter estimate of available observation days for these selected high- 
level desert stations. 

A strange and serious accident occurred in December on Mount 
Bruldvaros. It will be recalled that for tlie sake of uniformity of 



REPORT OP THE SECRETARY 113 

temperature conditions our observatories are in the form either of 
tunnels in solid rock or cemented chambers under ground. In a hard 
thundershower on January 24, 19;i0, the interior of the tunnel in 
the mountain face was struck by lifrhtning, and the bolometer, the 
resistance box, and other parts of the electric circuit were burned 
out. Fortunately a second bolometer and some other spare parts 
were in stock, so that the observer, Mr. Sordahl, by dilijjjence and 
clever adaptations, was able to restore the circuits so as to recom- 
mence observing with the loss of only four days. 

Mrs, Sordahl is keeping an interesting daily journal of events, 
and, having zoological training, is also making a valuable collection 
of the fauna and flora of the Mount Brukkaros region for the 
United States National Museum. 

PERSONNEL 

At Washington, Dr. C. G. Abbot continues as director. Finding 
himself unable to give sufficiently continuous attention to the work, 
he njipointed Mr. L. B. Aldrich to be assistant director, beginning 
May 19, 1930; F. E. Fowle, research assistant; W. H. Hoover, asso- 
ciate research assistant (detailed to the Division of Radiation and 
Organisms) ; Mr. A. Kramer, instrument maker; Mrs. A. M. Bond, 
statistical assistant, reinstated October 16, 1929, vice Miss M. Mars- 
den, resigned October 10, 1929; Mrs. M. D. (Denoyer) Johnson, com- 
puter; Mr. W. Oliver Grant, assistant computer. 

In the field : Mr. A. F. Moore, field director. Table Mountain, 
Calif.; Mr. F. A. Greeley, bolometric assistant. Table Mountain, 
Calif.; Mr. H. H. Zodtner, field director, Montezuma, Chile; Mr. 
C. P. Butler, bolometric assistant, Montezuma, Chile; Mr. L. O. 
Sordahl, field director, Mount Brukkaros, South West Africa; Mr. 
A. G. Froiland, bolometric assistant. Mount Brukkaros, South 
West Africa. 

SUMMARY 

This year has been notable for both disappointment and achieve- 
ment. Disappointment — because the high hopes of satisfactory ac- 
curacy raised by preliminary results of reduction of observations at 
Table Mountain proved to some extent illusory, and have given place 
to tests of new methods designed to remove more eirectually atmos- 
pheric sources of error. Achievement — in the invention of a new 
method of determining the amount of atmospheric ozone, applicable 
on every day in which solar radiation observations have been made; 
in the discovery of tiie apparently large and exceptionally important 



114 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

influence exercised by small short-interval solar variations on ter- 
restrial temperatures; and for the continuation under favorable 
auspices of observing at the station on Mount Brukkaros, South 
West Africa. 
Eespectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 8 

REPORT ON THE DIVISION OF RADIATION AND 
ORGANISMS 

Sik: I have the honor to submit the following report of progress 
made by the new Division of Radiation and Organisms during its 
first 3'ear of existence. 

The purpose of the division is to undertake those investigations 
dealing with radiation bearing directly, or indirectly, upon biological 
problems. The central idea in the development of the division is 
to build up an especially strong spectrophotomctric laborator}', with 
a staff of experienced physicists and technicians to work cooper- 
atively with men of biological training. Problems undertaken fall 
into two classes : 

1. Direct investigntioiis upon livini; organisms. 

2. Fuud.unental molecular structure and photochemical investigations re- 
lated to the bioloRical problems. 

Brieflj', the following developments have taken place. Basement 
space in the Smithsonian Building, previously used for storage, has 
been reconstructed into a modern physical, chemical, and biological 
laboratory. Equipment has been purchased, and tlie laboratory 
appointed. Offices have been furnished and developed in the north 
tower. A small staff of investigators, of highly specialized training 
in the various allied fiekls, has been assembled. Plans have been 
made, and equipment partially developed for growth of plants 
under controlled conditions. A preliminary experiment upon the 
phototropic i)ending of })lants has been carried to completion with 
interesting results. Equipment has been assembled for a more ex- 
tensive experiment in tliis field. In cooperation with the Fixed 
Nitrogen Laboratory, the near infrared investigation of the lialogen 
derivatives of benzene has been completed. 

Arrangements for cooperation with the l)ej)artment of Agricul- 
ture, in carrying out an experiment on the effect of light upon the 
rooting of Citrus cuttings and the growth of palms, have been con- 
summated. In cooperation with the Research C'orjioration, staff and 
shop have been provided for instrumental development.

116 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 

DEVELOPMENT OF LABORATORY 

The initial drafting of plans for the development of the space 
assigned to the division v^^as begun May 1, 1929. By July 1, the 
actual work of reconstruction, transforming the empty basement into 
a laboratory, was under way. Room No. 18, the largest of the three 
rooms originally assigned, some GO feet long by 20 feet wide, was 
planned to accommodate the main plant experiments and spectro- 
scopic work in the visible region. Three small constant temperature 
rooms were divided off for photometric and phototropic measure- 
ments, and control instruments. Provision was made for experi- 
ments dealing with the growth of plants under controlled conditions 
in one end of the long laboratory space remaining. The other end 
was arranged for the spectroscopic study of the sources of light 
required in these experiments. Room No. IT, one of the two smaller 
rooms, was subdivided into two parts, the larger portion, some 16 by 
16 feet, was equipped with soapstone sinks, hood, furnace, still, etc., 
for a chemical laboratory. This is required for the preparation of 
nutrient solutions which replace the soil in the growth of plants, for 
dessicating and weighing the plants, for the incidental chemical 
phases of other experiments, and later, for the photochemical experi- 
ments which may be undertaken. The smaller part of room 17, about 
9 bj^ 16 feet, has been equipped for glass blowing and related technical 
construction. Room 16, used prior to the completion of the space in 
the tower as office and drafting room, was subsequently subdivided 
into a large laboratory space and two small constant-temperature 
rooms for infra-red work. 

Throughout the laboratory, with the exception of the glass-blowing 
room, the windows were provided with light-proof curtains, so that 
the experiments could be carried out in the absence of daylight when 
required. Plumbing and heavy electrical installations were made so 
that service would be conveniently available for the experiments. 
This service includes gas and air, 110 and 220 volts, both alternating 
and direct current. Alternating current, not previously available in 
the Smithsonian, was brought in by way of the Freer Building. 
A special gas booster was installed to provide gas under sufficient 
pressure for the glass blowing of large pyrex apparatus. A large 
batter}'^ was installed, together with heavy leads for special constant- 
light sources in the photometer room, and also in the infra-red 
laboratory. All this general reconstruction, including carpentry, 
masonry, electrical wiring, plumbing, and painting, as well as the 
construction of special tables, was carried out either by, or under 
the direction of, the INIuseum organization, to whom the division is 
greatly indebted for the unusually fine laboratory resulting. The 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 117 

extensive reconstruction of the laboratory space was finiilly coiiqiK'ted 
toward the end of February, 11);]0. 

The detailed appointment and equipment of the laboratory proved 
to be a tremendous undortakinp:, particularly so, because of the 
border-line character of the pr()i)()scd invcsti<^ali<)ns. Although the 
laboratory is not unusually lar<re, i)rovision had to be made for 
phj'sical, chemical, and biological fields of experimentation. By the 
middle of Jul}' the volume of correspondence involved was such as 
to require the whole time of a stenographer, thus leading to the 
employment of Miss Stanley. Mr. Claik^ who joined the staff 
August 1, was of the greatest assistance in the selection of equij)ment, 
because of his wide experience in technical fields. During the entire 
year, a very large part of the director's time was devoted to this 
phase of the work. 

INITIATION OK KXri'KIMKNTS 

In spite of the construction work which was continuously in prog- 
ress, steps were immediately taken toward beginning experimental 
work. 

PLANT OnoAVTII EXI'KRIMENTS 

Arrangem«>nts were made with Mar3'land University for Doctor 
Johnston, plant physiologist, to serve in consulting capacity, spending 
three one-half days a week at the Smithsonian. In collaboration 
with Doctor Johnston, plans were drawn up for a large pre- 
conditioning chamber in which i)lan(s could be grown where the 
individual plants would be under identical conditions, and, at the 
same time, the humidity and temperature held at a definite point. 
Plans were also drawn up for intlividual giowth chambers to be 
mounted in two groups of four. These small growth chambers were 
to be water-cooled and gas-tight, so as to permit of the rigid control of 
the atmospheric ctm-tituents, as well as temperature and humidity. 
Windows were introduced for both lateral and overhead illumination. 
The bases were equipped with adapters for gas-tight connection be- 
tween the chamber and Mason jars for the nutrient solutions. As the 
division had no shop facilities, beyond such work as could be cari'ied 
out as an accomtnodation through the courtesy of the National Mu- 
seum and the Astrophysical Observatory, most of the construction 
had to be arranged for with private concerns. With the growth cham- 
bers themselves conqileted. the extensive development of ai)paratus 
for supply and control had to be suspended in March. 10;K), for hick 
of funds. Near the end of the year, in anticipation of new funds on 
July 1, orders were placed for manifold systems ;md other equipiu'-nt 
required in completing the first set of four chambers. 
28095—31 



118 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

As artificial light, because of its possibility of rigid control, is used 
to replace sunlight in most of these experiments, the problem of con- 
struction of such special sources becomes a considerable part of the 
undertaking. Because of his extensive experience in the commercial 
construction of Neon lamps, as well as his unusual skill in glass bloAv- 
ing, Mr. Clark was added to the staff. By October 1, his glass- 
bl'OAving laboratory was sufficiently complete to permit the commence- 
ment of construction of high vacuum systems to be used in the evacu- 
ation of special lamps and thermocouples. The constructive develop- 
ment of these sources will, undoubtedl}^, be a matter of experimenta- 
tion which will extend over several years. 

PPIOTOTROPIC EXPERIMENTS 

As it was early realized that the construction of special growth 
chambers would be an undertaking extending probably to two years, 
and undoubtedly requiring more funds than were immediately avail- 
able, another experiment dealing with the bending of plants in the 
presence of light was undertaken. This experiment could be carried 
out through the preliminary stages with equipment immediately at 
hand. A long constant-temperature room, constructed out of a por- 
tion of room No. 18, as has been mentioned, was ideally suited to this 
purpose. For this phototropic experiment a special photometer box 
was constructed. Two beams of light, originating at the extremities 
of the box, played from opposite sides on a central plant. By the in- 
troduction of water-cooled filters, these beams were restricted to a 
narrow range of visible radiation, and provision was made for four 
possible colors of light. 

Even before the completion of the laboratory, actual observations 
on the phototropic influence of different colors were being made. 
It was found immediately that beams of equal intensity but different 
color affected the bending of the plant in markedly different degree. 
A thermocouple was provided so that by the galvanometer deflection 
an accurate determination could be made of the relative intensities 
of the two beams. By adjusting the beam whose color had the 
lesser influence, its intensity could be increased until a balance was 
secured against the weaker, but more potent radiation, so that the 
plant would grow vertically without bending. 

Early in the experiment it was realized that the most important 
disturbing factor was the presence of small temperature fluctuations 
in the air surrounding the oat sprout whose bending was being 
observed. After many failures to remove this source of disturbance, 
which vitiated many of the early observations, a scheme was devised 
which overcame the difliculty. A double-walled cylindrical glass 
shield was placed around the s]:)rout, symmetrically, and maintained 
in continual rotation. Thus, if one side were unevenly heated, its 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 119 

influence would be carried around so that it was felt equally from 
all sides. Ultiniatel}', this only proved completely effective when 
the space between the double walls of glass was filled with water. 

In order to determine the wave-lengtli range transmitted by the 
filtei-s used in the phototropic experiment, spectrograms, secured 
through the cooperation of the Fixed Nitrogen Laboratory, were 
taken. These showed the varying amounts of light transmitted by 
the filter from an incandescent bulb of the type used in the experi- 
ment. In order to interpret the spectrograms, a self -registering 
microphotometer, previously secured by the Astrophysical Observa- 
tory, was set up in one of the small constant-temperature rooms. 
Curves were thus obtained, representing the relative transmission of 
these fdters for the various wave lengths, and so determining defi- 
nitely the region of the spectrum, or colors, used. 

Completion of this preliminary experiment in September of 1930, 
yielded the following facts: First, that red, or infra-red light, pro- 
duced no measurable effect; second, that yellow light of the type 
used, produced a small, but measurable bending ; third, that the green 
light was one thousand times (+ or —2 per cent) more effective than 
yellow; and finally, that blue light of the range used was thirty 
times more effective than the green, or thirty thousand times more 
effective than the yellow. 

The outstanding points of interest resulting from the preliminary 
experiments are two: First, the quantitative reproducibility of the 
ratios obtained, that is, within 5 per cent of the magnitudes quoted; 
second, the tremendous ratio observed between yellow and green, 
together with rapid increase of the effect as one proceeds to shorter 
wave lengths, tends to indicate a definite threshold wave length at 
which the phototropic influence shows itself. This is typical of 
photochemical reactions involving an electronic change of energy. 
Tiie conclusions drawn from this observation are of far-reaching 
importance, as this constitutes crucial evidence against any tiieory 
which seeks to explain phototropism as merely a thermal effect due 
to unequal absorption of radiant energy. 

Tiie preliminary results of this experiment proved so interesting, 
even at the early stages, that steps were immediately taken to prepare 
for a more elaborate experiment. Mr. Hoover, returning from 
extensive field experience with the Astrophysical Observatory, was 
assigned to the work of the division in December, 1929. An ex- 
perienced observer himself, naich of the successful carrying out of 
this phototropic experiment is due to his efforts. 

The things which immediately suggest them.selves as desirable 
in a new experiment are, flrst: To use a narrower wave-length range, 
or a purer color, in order to determine what wave lengths have a 
particular effect, and second; to use a larger number of different 



120 ANNUAL ItEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

wave-length regions, or colors, to determine where in the spectrum 
the phototropic influence begins as one proceeds to shorter wave 
lengths that is, from red to blue. For this purpose suitable screens 
are not available and one must, therefore, turn to a monochrometer. 
Such a monochrometer would be used, on the one side, to furnish 
all the different possible wave lengths or colors, while on the other, a 
single standard comparison source would be used. The phototropic 
influence of all the various wave lengths, would be expressed in terms 
of a single standard. As has been seen in the preliminary experi- 
ment, some thirty thousand times variation in phototropic effect is 
to be observed. The comparison light, must, therefore, be varied in 
intensity over a large range. For this purpose an optical bench has 
been purchased. By means of this bench, the comparison light may 
be varied b}^ var^dng the distance from the plant over a range of 
three meters. Since the intensity of light varies inversely as the 
square of the distance from the source, this permits a tremendous 
range of possible intensities. As funds v.'cre not available for the 
purchase of a monochrometer, plans were made for the construction 
of an instrument from optical parts available in tlie Smithsonian. 
Lenses belonging to the National Museum, and originally used as 
projectors, were loaned to the division for the construction of this 
monochrometer. A prism and mirror were loaned by the Astro- 
physical Observatory. A spectrometer bearing of a novel type, in- 
volving an inverted cone with a ball thrust, was constructed by Mr, 
Kramer in the Astrophj'sical Observatorj'^ shop. Because of the 
I)ressure of other work in the shop, this monochrometer, begun in 
February, was not completed until August of 1930. Preparations 
for this more extensive experiment are now nearing completion. 

COOPERATION 

During the second half of the year. Doctor "Weniger from Oregon 
State College came to the laboratory and undertook the development 
of more sensitive radiometers for the xlstrophysical Observatory. 
The facilities of the laboratorj^, and a considerable part of Mr. 
Clark's time were placed at his disposal. At the termination of the 
6-month period, it was necessary for Doctor Weniger to return to his 
position in charge of the Physics Department at Oregon State Col- 
lege. The completion of the development of these new radiometers 
is, however, still in progress in his laboratory at Corvallis, Oreg. 
The radiometers, when finally developed, will not only be of unusual 
value of the Astrophysical Observatory in its study of stellar radi- 
ation, but also to the Division of Radiation and Organisms in its 
contemplated work in the infra-red spectrum upon the molecular 
structure of polyatomic molecules. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 121 

It will be noted, in this roughly chronological discussion of the 
work of the year, that the only experiments mentioned came under 
the first head of direct experimentation on living organisms. Some 
jjrogress, however, has been made under the second head in the sub- 
division dealing with molecular structure. Due to the lack of funds 
und shop facilities, it was impossible to undertake any of this work 
at the Smithsonian. The only steps taken in that direction were, 
first: The construction of two large tanks which will be used for 
vacuum spectrograph bodies, and, second, the provision of special 
room space in the reconstruction of the basement. Fortunately, 
however, through the very generous cooperation of the Fixed Nitro- 
gen Laboratory, work begun at the Fixed Nitrogen Laboratory by 
Doctor Brackett during the four months previous to his appoint- 
ment by the Smithsonian, has been continued during the past j'ear. 
Mr. Liddel, appointed as a junior chemist on its staff, has actively 
])ushed the research work contemplated under the direction of and 
in cooperation with the Smithsonian. The first work undertaken, 
namely, the study of the near infra-red absorption spectra of the 
halogen derivatives of benzene, has been carried through to comple- 
tion so far as available materials and equipment permit. Predic- 
tions made in the study of the paraffines in regard to the wave-length 
position of the absorption due to vibration of hydrogen with respect 
to carbon, have been borne out in the case of the phenyl derivatives. 
Tiie position of the second overtone of this vibration promises to 
furnish an interesting basis for determinating the binding forces 
ui)on the hydrogen atoms in different positions in the various organic 
compounds. The work will be extended during the coming year, 
largely to nitrogen compounds of a more immediate interest to the 
Fixed Nitrogen Laboratory, and, at the same time, of great impor- 
tance in biological connections. 

Photochemical work bearing on biological problems can not be 
undertaken until additional financial support can be obtained. In 
the infra-red spectroscopic anal3'sis, undertaken at the Fixed Nitro- 
gen Laboratory because of its bearing upon the problems of molecular 
structure, the range of spectrum which can be studied is limited by 
the transmission of glass of wliich the prisms are constructed. It 
has been the plan to build, at the Smithsonian, spectrographs in 
which prisms of salt will be used. This will permit the extension 
of the infra-red investigations from 2V2/A to Ibfi. A more complete 
understanding of the structure of polyatomic molecules Avill depend 
upon securing the information from these regions of longer wave 
lengtlis, as the most complete i)os.sible data upon vibration wave 
lengths must be secured if progress is to be made. The actual con- 



122 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

structioii of intitruments for this purpose was more or less indefi- 
nitely iDOsti^oned for lack of funds and shop facilities as well as 
laboratory staff. Arrangements for meeting this situation were 
finally completed toward the end of the fiscal year. 

In such an undertaking of border-line investigation, it is not sur- 
prising that cooperation should have become a matter of unusual 
importance. Not onl}^ is the division cooperating closely with the 
University of Maryland in the plant physiological side, with the 
Fixed Nitrogen Laboratory in the molecular structure work, with 
the Research Corporation in instrumental development, but also, in 
a large degree Avitli other bureaus of the Department of Agriculture. 
Extensive plans have been developed, and something over $1,800 
api3ropriated by the Department of Agriculture for investigation 
of the effect of various radiation conditions upon the rooting of Citrus 
fruits and the growth of date palms. This work is under the spon- 
sorship and cooperative direction of Doctor Swingle. It is proposed 
to complete the second group of four individual growth chambers 
for that purpose. 

PERSONNEL 

During the fiscal year the personnel was as follows : 

Research associate iu charge, Dr. F. S. Brackett. 

Consulting plant physiologist, Dr. Earl S. Johnston, 

Research assistant, L. B. Clark. 

Research assistant assigned by Astrophysical Observatory, W. 11. Hoover. 

SUMMARY 

A well balanced and efficient laboratory has been developed. The 
essential nucleus of a staff has been assembled. An experiment in 
each of the main fields has been carried through to completion with 
interesting results. Essential cooperations of a nmtually profitable 
character have been established. Foundations have been laid for 
extensive investigations of importance in the fields of biophysics 
and molecular structure. Preparations have been made for making 
generally available specialized instruments developed by the division. 
Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 9 

REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF 
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE 

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on tlio 
operations of the United States Re<j:ional Bureau of the Interna- 
tional Catalogue of Scientific Literature for the fiscal year ending 
June 30, 1930. 

Since publication of the catalogue was suspended by the London 
Central Bureau, owing to advanced costs in printing and the ina- 
bility of the cooperating European countries to meet these advances 
with their depreciated and unstable financial resources, it has been 
tlie policy of this bureau to spend only so much of its annual con- 
gressional appropriation as is necessary to keep the organization 
alive i)ending the time when reorganization is possible and publica- 
tion can be resumed. The gross expenditure for the past year was 
$5,457.96 out of the appropriation of $7,885. 

Tn the several preceding reports conditions aifecting the catalogue 
due to the late war were noted, and in the last report definite sug- 
gestions were made regarding possible means of refinancing the 
enterprise and estimates of the sum needed were submitted. Owing 
to the still unsettled political and financial conditions abroad, no 
definite scheme for reorganization has 3'et been submitted by the 
director of the central bureau or the chairman of the executive com- 
mittee, in whom authority for this purpose is vested. 

The proposals looking toward reorganization made in the last 
aiiTuial report were discussed in an article entitled " The Interna- 
tional Catalogue of Scientific Literature Again," by Dr. Ernest 
Cushing Richardson, consultant in bibliography and research, 
Library of Congress, published in "Science," June 20, 1930 (Vol. 
LXXI, No. 1851 pp. 635-637), and as Doctor Richardson is one of 
the great international authorities on bibliography and on the needs 
of librarians it is thought advisable to quote at length his remarks, 
hoi)ing thereby to aid the effort being made to refinance the catalogue.

124 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

It is suggested that a revolving fund of $75,000 and 1,000 library subscriptions 
of $50 for 17 volumes will insure the enterprise. Whether or not this is 
enougli is a detail. If this catalogue or something like it is an indispensable 
tool for reseai-eh, as many first-class scientists seem to think, then any neces- 
sary amount should and probably can be had. If the catalogue is not needed, 
too much money is now being spent on it. Why waste more? 

The Smithsonian raises this question plainly. Why ask the American Gov- 
ernment to continue to appropriate six or seven thousand dollars a year in the 
procrastinated hope of a resurrection, if the project is better dead? If it is 
needed, why procrastinate? 

By putting tlie question tlie Institution has deserved the tlianks of all con- 
cerned. It is to be hoped that it will not let the matter rest until it has 
a square answer from all responsible parties. * * * 

♦ * * The question raised liy the Smithsonian is not the question of pre- 
senting a new project to be justilied, financed and initiated, but whether per- 
fectly good machinery worth at least $3,000,000 is to be scrapped, in an enter- 
prise bound to be revived sometime, as Professor Armstrong, of the Royal 
Society, prophesies and as many scientific bibliographers in many countries 
are on record as believing. 

It is at this point that the overture of the Smithsonian becomes a matter 
of practical business concern both in the research trust endowments and to the 
libraries. The research endowments are bombarded with bibliographical proj- 
ects of varying method and degrees of merit. They aid or support a 
good many projects. Tliey are deeply concerned as trust organizations 
to put their money where it will do the most good. Other things 
being equal they prefer to put it where one dollar will do the work of four. 
This seems to be a spot where one million, i)erhaps a quarter of a million, 
will do the work of four millions. If its usefulness merely averages with 
these other projects the endowments are likely to feel that its claims come 
first. It is here they can give the most bibliographical service with the least 
money. The proposition touches the libraries in a very similar way. If and 
when the matter is revived it will depend for financing, if not on the endow- 
ments, then on library subscriptions. If this machine is scrapped, when a new 
one is started either a $3,000,000 endowment must be had from promoters of 
research or a quadruple price charged to libraries. 

This leads straight to the crucial question of whether the international cata- 
logue is in fact a primary, essential or indispensable tool in such sense that 
it is bound to be revived sometime. It no doubt seems a futile and mortifying 
matter to those who have been deeply engaged in the problem for 30 year^ 
that they should have to rejustify and refight a matter which was fought to 
the finish 30 years ago. But it is fair enough. It is not the only real biblio- 
graphical need of science. There are at least two other equally well-defined 
needs — abstracts and handbooks. Without disparaging the usefulness of these 
two other tools, it must be confessed tliat a good ease is made by those who 
claim that something like the international catalogue is the essential and only 
indispensable tool among the three types. 

A dispassionate general bihliogi'apher must recognize that this is a conclu- 
sion towards which the whole history of bibliographical experience tends. The 
complete survey, in full title form, of the whole literature of any subject or 
group of subjects is the only solution of the main need of the student in re- 
searcli and in the liighcr learning, that is, completeness, and the best solution 
as to his need for a perspective. ♦ ♦ *

APPENDIX 10 
REPORT ON THE LIBRARY 

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi- 
ties of the library of the Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal year 
eiidedJune 30, 1930: 

THE LIBRARY 

The Smithsonian library, or library system, is composed of the 
10 major and 3G minor libraries of the Institution. It numbers 
somewhat more than 800,000 volumes, pamphlets, and charts, of 
which many are on art, literature, history, music, and philosophy, 
but most on science and technology. The system is especially strong 
in serial publications and in the reports, proceedings, and transac- 
tions of the learned societies and institutions of the world. The 
major units are the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress, 
the Smithsonian office library, the Langley aeronautical library, and 
the libraries of the United States National Museum, the Bureau of 
American Ethnology, the Astrophysical Observatory, the National 
Gallery of Art, the Freer Gallery of Art, the Division of Radiation 
and Organisms, and the National Zoological Park. The minor units 
are the sectional libraries of the National Museum. The system, 
with its highly specialized collections, the gathering of which has 
been proceeding since 1846, the date when the Smithsonian began 
its work, has brought to the Institution and through it to the Gov- 
ernment and to American scholars generally the results of the re- 
search of the world during its most important scientific era, and thus 
has contributed not a little to the fulfilment of the purpose for which 
the Institution was founded, namely, that of increasing and diffusing 
knowledge among men. 

CHANGES IN STAFF 

A number of changes occurred in the staff. Miss Isabel L. Towner, 
assistant librarian in the National Museum, after several years of 
noteworthy service, resigned to accept an editorial position in New 
York. She was succeeded by Miss Leila G. Forbes, a graduate of 
St. Lawrence University and of the Pratt Library School, who had 
been for many years librarian of Randolph-Macon Woman's College. 

Miss Ethel A. L. Lacy, assistant librarian in the National Museum, 
also resigned to take a position in another Washington library. Her 
126 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 127 

place was filled by the a]">i)ointinent of Miss Gcrtnirle L. Woodin, a 
frraduate of "Wellesley ColK'jre and of the Albany Library School, 
who had been for some time a junior librarian on the roll of the 
International Exchanjrcs. Mrs. Hope Hanna SiTiunons, junior 
librar}' assistant in the National ^fuseuni, was promoted to the va- 
cant junior librarianship. Mrs. ^fary Arnold Baer, under library 
assistant in the ^fuseuin, was advanced to Mrs. Simmons' former 
position. Miss Marpjaret Moreland, a graduate of the library science 
department of George Washington University, who was already 
serving temporarily on the roll of the International Exchanges, was 
selected to succeed Mrs. Tiaer. 

Miss Anna M. Link, a former teacher, and at present a student 
of library science at George "Washington University, was appoii\ted 
to the position of minor library assistant in the Astrophysical Ob- 
servatory. ^Ir. William O. Grant, assistant messenger in the Na- 
tional Museum, was given a better position elsewhere in the Insti- 
tution, and Mr. Stephen Stuntz took his place. The temporary 
employees were Mr. Alan Blanchard, Mrs. Daisy Cadle, Miss 
Rosalie Dimmette, Miss Katherine Everliart, ^fiss Angela Moore, 
Miss Margaret Moreland. i\Irs. M. Landon Reed, Miss Jcnnette 
Seiler, Miss Eleanor Spielman, and Mrs. M. Frances Watkins. 

EXCnANOE OF PUBLICATIONS 

In the early days of the Institution the accessions to the library 
usualh' came by purchase, gift, or copj-right — for in those days the 
copyright law provided that one copy of each new book published 
in the United States should be deposited in the Librar}' of Congress 
and one in the Smithsonian librar3\ Increasingly, however, since 
that time the accessions have come by exchange of publications with 
editors of journals and with learned institutions and societies, until 
now, while some are still obtained by purchase and gift, by far tlie 
greater number are received in exchange. Many of the latter come 
throTigh the United States International Exchange Service, which is 
administered by the Institution. 

During the fiscal year just closed the Smithsonian library received 
24,063 packages by mail and 2,077 through the Exchange, each con- 
taining one or more publications. These were stamped and entered — 
with the exception of the documents from foreign governments — and 
assigned to the units of the library system in which they would be of 
most use in furthering the work of the Institution and its branches, 
but chiefly, of course, to the Smithsonian deposit and the library of 
the National Museum. There were a number of unusually large 
sendings, the largest being one of 208 pieces from the Academy of 
Sciences at Heidelberg. This went far toward completing the set 
of the Academy's publications in the deposit. 



128 ANNUAL EEPOTIT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

Anion^ tlie items received were several thousand dissertations from 
the universities of Basle, Berlin, Bern, Bonn, Breslau, Budapest, 
Erlan<ren, Freiber^r, Giessen, Greifswald, Halle, Heidelberg, Helsing- 
fors, Jena, Johns Hopkins, Kiel, Konigsberg, Leipzig, Lund, Mar- 
burg, Neucliatel, Pennsylvania, Kostock, Strasbourg, Tiibingen, 
Utrecht, Wiirzburg, and Ziirich ; and from technical schools at Berlin, 
Bonji, Braunschweig, Delft, Dresden, Freiberg, and Karlsruhe. 

Most of the 1,711 letters written by the library staff during the 
year — which, by the way, represented an increase of about 400 over 
the previous year — had to do with the acquisition of this material. 
Many of these involved careful checking of sets and reviewing of 
earlier correspondence. Some proposed or accepted exchange for 
new publications. This gratifying increase in the number of letters 
written by the library xvas effected largely by the recent reorganiza- 
tion of the accessions department. As the immediate result of this 
increase the exchange correspondence of the library was brought 
practically up to date. Most of the letters were prepared in re- 
sponse to special requests for publications needed by the Smithsonian 
deposit and the libraries of the National Museum and the Astro- 
physical Observatory. The number of items thus obtained was 2,928. 

GIFTS 

As usual, there were many gifts. The largest one came from Mr. 
James Townsend Russell, jr., honorary collaborator in old world 
archeology in the National Museum, who presented to the Institu- 
tion 1,400 volumes on different subjects, together with a collection of 
music. These will be assigned mainly to the Smithsonian deposit, 
the office library, and the libraries of the National Museum and the 
National Gallery of Art. About 150 volumes and 1,000 periodicals, 
chiefly on aeronautics, came from the National Aeronautic Associa- 
tion; and 2,000 or m.ore miscellaneous scientific publications from the 
American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American 
Association of Museums, the Anthropological Society of Washington, 
the Geophysical Laboratory, the Hygienic Laboratory, the Interna- 
tional Catalogue of Scientific Literature, the Philosophical Society 
of Washington, and the Library of Congress. Another important 
gift was that of 58 volumes on Japanese history and literature, from 
the Historiographical Institute, Tokyo. 

Among other gifts were GO volumes, largely in the field of mining 
engineering, from Mr. A, F. G. Lucas, and copies of the following: 
Mythology of All Races, volumes 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 11, by various 
authors, from the Archaeological Institute of America and the 
Marshall Jones Co., of Boston ; The Birds of Tropical West Africa, 
volume 1, by David Armitage Bannerman, from the Crown Agents 
for the Colonies on behalf of the Governments of Gambia, Gold

130 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

SMITHSONIAN DEPOSIT 

The Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress is the main 
unit in the library system of the Institution. It dates from 1866, 
when for various reasons Congress granted authority to the Smith- 
sonian to deposit its library of 40,000 volumes in the Library of 
Congress. Since that time the collection has been steadily increased 
by scndings from the Institution until it now numbers more than 
a half million volumes, pamphlets, and charts, together with thou- 
sands of volumes still uncompleted. The deposit comprises works 
relating to many branches of knowledge, but chiefly to the natural 
and physical sciences, and includes a collection of scientific serials 
and of the publications of learned institutions and societies that is 
unique for completeness among groups of its kind. Most of the 
items have come to the Institution during its 80 years and more of 
existence in exchange for its publications and those of the Govern- 
ment bureaus under its direction. In 1900 the Library of Con- 
gress established a special division, known as the Smithsonian divi- 
sion, to take charge of the scientific publications in the deposit, as 
well as of similar works belonging to the library itself. The rest 
of the publications are shelved in the other divisions of the library 
according to subject. It follows that the Smithsonian deposit is 
not, as many have supposed, synonymous and coextensive with the 
Smithsonian division. 

In the course of the year just closed the library of the Institution 
forwarded to the deposit 19,144 publications, consisting of 2,720 
volumes, 11,802 parts of volumes, 4,352 pamphlets, and 270 charts. 
Among these were 2,205 publications that the Smithsonian library 
had obtained in exchange for the deposit, in response to want cards 
sent from the order division, periodical division, and Smithsonian 
division, or more than two and one-half times the number obtained 
in the fiscal year 1929 and nearly five times the number in 1928. 
Among them, too, were 4,484 dissertations. The library also for- 
warded 13,729 documents of foreign governments, without stamping 
or entering them, to the division of documents. The total number 
of publications, therefore, added to the Library of Congress during 
the year by the Smithsonian library was 32,873 — an increase of 
nearly 10,000 over the year before. This noteworthy increase, which 
was due primarily to the reorganization of the accessions department 
already referred to, was due also, in no small measure, to the hearty 
cooperation the library staff received from those in immediate 
charge of the various divisions of the Library of Congress chiefly 
concerned, notably the Smithsonian division. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 131 

NATIONAL MUSEUM LIBRARY 

The library of the United States National Museum, which con- 
sists of two major collections — namely, on natural history anil tech- 
nology — shelved respectively in the Natural History Building and 
the Arts and Industries Building, and of 3G minor collections scat- 
tered among the various sections of the Museum, is, next to the 
Smithsonian deposit, the largest and most important unit in the 
Smithsonian library system. It numbers 76,879 volumes and 108,297 
pamphlets. During the last fiscal year it was increased by 2,317 
vt)lumes and GG8 pampldets. Most of these came in exchange, but 
many were purchased and souie were received as gifts. 

The staff had a very busy year. They entered 8,805 periodicals, 
catalogued 1,I-1G volumes and 85G pamphlets, and added 4,49;) cards 
to the catalogue of the natural history library and 295 to that of the 
technology library. Tiiey assigned to the sectional libraries 5,G22 
publications, and lent to the Museum staff and other Smithsonian 
employees 7,745, of which 2,820 were charged at the recently estab- 
lished loan desk in the Arts and Industries Building. Of the loans, 
1,889 were borrowed from the Library of Congress and 24G else- 
where. The number of jmblications returned to the Library of 
Congress was 2,250, and to other libraries 241. The loans to Gov- 
ernment libraries and to libraries outside of Washington were 181. 
Among the latter were those of the American Museum of Natural 
History, the New York Botanical Garden, and the Department of 
Agriculture, Ottawa, Canada, and of the following colleges and uni- 
vereities: Buffalo, California, Goucher, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, 
MacMaster (Toronto), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
Minnesota, North Carolina State, Princeton, and Tennessee. The 
number of volumes prepared for binding was 2,071, of which 1,271 
were bound. The others will be sent to the bindery when additional 
funds become available early in the next fiscal year. This work en- 
tailed considerable checking of sets, collating, and correspondence. 
In this connection it is of interest to note that the library was able 
to obtain, without expense, GGS volumes and parts lacking in its sets 
by writing special letters to the journals and learned societies 
concerned. 

The reference use of the library, not only by those connected with 
the Smithsonian Institution and the ditl'erent branches of the Gov- 
ernment, but also by students and the public in general, increased 
somewhat over that of the year before and necessitated a conx'.spond- 
ing increase of work on the part of the staff. Hundreds of incpiiries 
for information of various kinds were received and answered. To 
the technology library ah^ne, with its 700 visitoi-s for the year, out- 



132 



ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 



side of the Smithsonian employees, came about 225 such inquiries, 
while to the natural history library came many more. 

The sectional libraries, which number 36, are the immediate work- 
ing tools of the curators and their assistants. Many of them are 
rich in highly specialized material, nuich of which has not been 
catalogued. These libraries present other problems, too, that are 
pressing for solution, and one of their most urgent needs is of two 
assistants who can be detailed from the main library to spend their 
full time looking after the interests of these smaller but very impor- 
tant library units. During the past year it was possible for the 
library staff to find time for only a few pieces of work in these 
libraries, such as preparing 2,G80 cards for the pamphlet collection 
in the division of mammals, aiding the department of geology in 
increasing quite materially its set of the publications of the various 
State geological surveys, and cooperating with the scientific staff of 
the division of plants in reorganizing the library of that division, 
especially by arranging 10,000 cards for its reference file and get- 
ting the John Donnell Smith botanical collection ready for transfer 
to its shelves. This included the making of a catalogue of the 
collection. 

These libraries are as follows :

OFFICE LIBRARY 



The office library' .serves Smithsonian emploj^ecs in two ways. It 
keeps constantly on hand in the administrative offices, reading rooms, 
and other convenient places many works of general reference, includ- 
ing dictionaries, encyclopedias, atlases, and sets of Smithsonian and 
other learned publications; it also provides material, to a limited

fxteiit, of a less teclmiral cliaiactiT. lU'siirnrd inaiiily fur a nillural 
and, in some instances, even a recreational purpose. Most of the [)nh- 
lications in tlie latter j;roup have been received as jjifts from em- 
ployees of the Institution or from friends outside. During the last 
year several hundred such pulilications were «riven to the Institution, 
especially by Mr. J. Townsend Kussell, jr., of the scientific staff of 
the National Museum. These will soon be catalogued and placed on 
the shelves of the otiice library. The hai)py arran<;ement previously 
nuide with the Library of Congress to lend to the library from time 
to time for a brief period some of the latest popular and semipopular 
books was continued, much to the satisfaction of the Smithsonian 
employees. To the ofKce librar}' were added 1,*J3S vohnnes and JilG 
pamphlets. Its periodical entries were 835. 

BDllEAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY LIBRARY 

The library of the Bureau of American Ethnology, which is housed 
in the Smithsonian Building, is one of the more important units in 
the library system of the Institution. It is made up, in the main, 
of works on anthropology, not a lew of which are quite rare. It 
is particularly rich in publications on the archeology, history, myths, 
religion, arts, sociology, language, and general culture of the Ameri- 
can Indians. Tlie collection has some valuable manuscripts, many 
photographs, and several Indian vocabularies. The library numbers 
29,071 volumes and 10,527 pamphlets. During tlie last year it was 
increased b}' 551) volumes and 150 j)amphlets. The number of periodi- 
cals entered was 4,106, and the number of volumes bound 210. The 
additions to the card catalogue were 3,420. The loans were 840. As 
usual, hundreds of publications were consulted in the library, 
especially by members of the bureau staff, and considerable reference 
work was done by those in charge of the collection. 

ASTROrilYSlCAL OBSERVATORY LIBRARY 

The library of the Astrophysical Observatory, while one of the 
smaller units in the library system, consists of publications of 
especial value in the astrophysical and meteorological woik of the 
Institution. The main part of the collection is shelved in the Smith- 
sonian Building, the rest in the observatory itself, where it is im- 
mediately available for the use of the investigators. Its file of 
current periodicals is also k'cpt in the observatory, as is the card 
catalogue of the library. The collection nunil)ei-s 4,()U8 \(»lumes and 
3,100 pamphlets. To it were added during the last year 140 volumes 
and 151 pamphlets. The numl)er of volumes i)ound was 50. 
28095—31 10

RADIATION AND ORGANISMS LIBRARY 

The library of radiation and organisms, which was established in 
1929 as a major unit of the Smithsonian library system to meet 
the needs of a brancli of research recently organized under a separate 
division of the Institution, made satisfactory progress during the 
year. An excellent working nucleus of reference books was obtained 
for it, and arrangements were made to receive regularly the out- 
standing magazines in the field of the division's special interest. A 
dictionary card catalogue was begun for the collection. At the end of 
the year the library numbered 74 volumes, 8 pamphlets, and 6 charts, 
besides about a hundred unbound periodicals. 

LANGLEY AERONAUTICAL LIBRARY 

During the year the Institution's famous collection of aeronautical 
publications, known as the Langley aeronautical library, was re- 
moved from the main hall of the Smithsonian Building, where it 
had been kept for many years, to the Library of Congress. There, 
with other and larger collections of its kind, it will be more cen- 
trally available to the technician and historian as well as the general 
student. 

The collection will be under the immediate supervision of the 
chief of the newly organized division of aeronautics, in the develop- 
ment of which the Guggenheim fund has recently taken a generous 
interest. But it will remain a unit of the Smithsonian library sys- 
tem — a second deposit in the Library of Congress, distinct from the 
main unit of that system known as the Smithsonian deposit, but 
subject to the same conditions that Congress specified in providing 
for the establishment of the older and larger deposit. Its identity 
will be shown by a special stamp and book plate, and the collection 
will continue to bear the name of the Langley aeronautical library 
and will be increased from time to time by sendings from the 
Smithsonian — it being the desire of the Institution to preserve the 
collection as an independent and growing memorial to its third 
secretary, whose work marked the beginning of the scientific study 
of aeronautics in the United States. 

Many of the library's rarest items once belonged to Secretary 
Langley; others to such well-known investigators and experimenters 
as Alexander Graham Bell, Octave Chanute, and James Means. 
The library numbers 1,734 volumes and 923 pamphlets and includes 
files of most of the early aeronautical magazines, together with a 
large number of photographs, letters, and newspaper clippings. It 
was increased the past year by 37 volumes, 3G2 parts of volumes, 
and 85 pamphlets. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 135 

NATIONAL OALLFRY OF ART LIBRARY 

Wlic'ii in r.'iiO (ho X;i(ion;il (Jallcry of Art was set apart as a pcp- 
arato Govornniont bureau under the administrative charge of the 
Smithsonian Institution, its library ceased to be a sectional library 
of the National Museum and became a major unit of the Smithsonian 
library system. Since that time the collection, already an imjiortant 
nucleus of works on tine art, both American and foreign, has grown 
yearly by carefully selected additions, until it now contains 1,01)8 
volumes and 1,1CC pamphlets. Small as the collection still is, it 
almost fills the space available for books in the present limited gallery 
(juarters in the Natural History ]kiilding and will soon need more 
room there unless in the early future a special building is provided 
for the gallery. "WTien that is at hand, the collection can be ade- 
quately shelved, and be permitted to grow more rapidly, to meet the 
expanding needs of the gallery. The library was increased during 
the year just closed by 97 volumes and 60 pamphlets. Most of these 
were purchased or received in exchange, but not a few were gifts, 
especially from Dr. "William H. Holmes, director of the gallery. The 
number of periodicals entered was 271. 

rKEER GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY 

The library of the Freer Gallery of Art is one of the most unique 
in the Smithsonian library system. Centering, as it does, primarily'' 
in the interest of the Freer Gallery in the arts and cultures of the 
Far East, India, Persia, and the nearer east, it richly supplements 
for the purpose of research — especially with its publications in the 
Chinese and Japanese languages, some of which are very rare — the 
corresponding collections in the Library of Congress. It also has to 
do somewhat with the life and works of various American painters, 
notably James McNeill Whistler, many of whose pictures are the 
possession of the gallery, and with the famous biblical manuscripts 
of the fourth and fifth centuries, known as the Washington Manu- 
scripts, which the gallery is so fortunate as to own. 

The main collection numbers 4,362 volumes and 2,998 pamphlets; 
the special collection designed for the use of the field staff of the 
gallery, 814 volumes and 500 pamphlets. The former was increased 
during the last fiscal year by 93 volumes and 229 pamphlets. The 
number of volumes bound was 29. During the year, thanks to the 
generous cooperation of the gallery, the work of reclassifying and 
recataloguing the library was undertaken. In this connection 1,134 
cards were prepared and filed in the new dictionary catalogue. This 
work will be continued the coming year.

Smithsonian library system on June 30, 1930, was as follows: 




Total 782,830 

This total does not, of course, include the large number of volumes 
in the system still uncatalogued or awaiting completion. 



UNION CATALOGUE 

Further progress was made on the union dictionary catalogue begun 
a short time ago. This will require many years to complete, but 
when it is finished it Avill be an invaluable instrument in the reference 
activities of the Institution, for it will constitute a central author- 
title-subject finding list, for the most part on Library of Congress 
cards, of all the items in all the 40 Smithsonian libraries. Unfor- 
tunately, with the present force, the progress of this work must con- 
tinue to fall short each year of what we should like. 

Notwithstanding this fact, however, the staff, besides keeping up 
with the current work, was able to finish cataloguing the important 
John Donnell Smith botanical collection, with the exception of one set 
of pamphlets and reprints, and to make considerable headway in cata- 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 137 

loguing the library of the Freer Gallery of Art. This work involved 
classify liijjj the publications and in<)untin;j: many <>f them in pami)hl('t 
binders. The staff spent some time in cliecking the Lan^loy aero- 
nautical collection and makini; the necessary chauf^es in the cataloj^ue 
cards incident to the transfer of tliat library to the Library of Con- 
<rress. It worked out a plan by which the Library of Con<;ress can 
obtain copies of certain cards prepared by the staff for liling in its 
union catalo<iue. It also provided that Library with manuscrijit 
copies of a iroodly number of titles, to be printed and distributed with 
the cards regularly issued by the Library. In atldition, it added more 
than 15,000 cards to the shelf list of the Museum library, thus ad- 
vaijcing it to a point from Avhich it can be completed at an early date, 
and began the preparation of a union shelf list to be kept, with the 
union catalogue, in the Smithsonian Building. For this shelf list 
27,417 cards were made, besides those prepared for the current publi- 
cations catalogued. The cataloguing work of the year may be 
shown in detail by the following statistics: 

Volumes catnlocfued 4, 902 

Volumes recjitnlogued 15 

ramplilets catalogued 2, G22 

riiiirt.s catalogued 289 

Typed cards added to catalogue 8,710 

Library of Congress cards added to catalogue 26,513 

SPECIAL ACTIVITIES 

Some of the special activities of the year have already been re- 
corded under the appropriate sections of this report. Those that have 
not been may be set down here. One detailed piece of work was 
the checking of several long sets of publications, with a view to 
completing them, especially those of the Carnegie Institution of 
Washington, the Zoological Society of London, and the LTnited 
States Geological Survey. In connection Avith this work hundreds 
of paper-covered publications of the United States Geological Survey 
were listed for return to the survey, to be replaced by cloth-bound 
volumes, in accordance with a recent agreement between the Museum 
and the survey for the exchange of bound copies of their respective 
publications. The reports and other publications of the State 
geological surveys, which had been brought together the previous 
year from various Smithsonian libraries, were also checked and most 
of them used to fill gaps in either the main library of the Museum 
or the library in the department of geology. The 434 volumes not 
needed for this purpose were given to the United States Geological 
Survey. About 1,050 scientific reprints were distributed to the 
curators. 



138 ANNUAL EEPOllT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

Tho Wistar Institute cards were filed to date, and more than 
10,000 Concilium Bibliographicum cards of the author set were filed 
in the main library, while the assignment, begun the year before, of 
appropriate parts of the systematic set to the sectional libraries was 
continued. It is hoped that the rest of this set can soon be deposited 
m the sections interested, and that in the future the new increments 
as they are received can immediately be sorted and sent to the cu- 
rators for their files. In preparation for the forthcoming Supplement 
to the Union List of Serials, the staff checked the periodical records 
of all the Smithsonian libraries, except the deposit in the Library of 
Congress, for new entries and for sets completed since 1925 — a task 
which required a great deal of time. The work of organizing, the 
scientific duplicates in the west stacks of the main building, which 
had been in progress for several years, was completed to the point 
where most of the material became available for use. The result was 
that before the end of the year hundreds of publications — many of 
which could not otherwise have been obtained except by purchase, 
and then often at fanc}^ prices — were taken from the collection and 
assigned to the sets in which they were lacking. The rest will soon 
be used in the same way, or will be sent in exchange to other 
libraries. 

In this connection it may be reported that 93 volumes and parts 
of the Bulletin of the Philosophical Society of Washington were 
sent to the society for use in completing its three sets. About 9,600 
other duplicates not needed by the libraries of the Institution were 
distributed to Harvard University, Yale University, Chicago Uni- 
versity, and the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, for 
similar use, under an arrangemxcnt by which the Smithsonian is to 
receive an equivalent exchange, not merely of old material, but in 
the case of at least two of the universities, of new material issued by 
their presses. This happy arrangement will result in placing pub- 
lications not required by the Institution in strategic positions else- 
where for the furthering of research and in conserving Smithsonian 
funds for the purchase of publications that can not be obtained by 
exchange. 

The popular and semipopular material that had previously been 
brought together in a special building behind the Astrophysical 
Observatory and roughly grouped was more carefully arranged, 
pending final disposal. The set of star charts that the Smithsonian 
has been receiving for some years from various important observa- 
tories was transferred as a semipermanent loan to the United States 
Naval Observatory, and the Institution's set of Russian meteorologi- 
cal bulletins was likewise transferred to the United States Weather 
Bureau, the purpose in each case being to place the material where 
it would be of most aid to investigators. 



KEPORT OF THE SECRETARY 139 

It might be aildoj that the librarian <;iive 14 lectures tluring tlic 
year, chiefly before local groups, including the Shakespeare Society. 
Several of these were on the Smithsonian Institution and its library 
system. He also contributed a chapter on the libraries of the Insti- 
tution to the history of Washington, entitled " Washington — Past 
and Present," which has recently appeared. 

PHYSICAL CONDmON AND EQUIPMENT 

About 400 feet of new steel shelving were installed in the main 
stack room of the Museum library. This additional space will relieve 
for the time being the congested condition of the library and will 
provide room for the rearranging of the collections that is soon to 
be undertaken. The improvement in physical equipment and ap- 
pearance of several of the sectional libraries, notably those of botany 
and geology, should also be mentioned. 

(X)NCLUSION 

On the whole, the system of libraries under the Smithsonian made 
considerable progress during the year toward becoming a complete 
and available reference instrument worthy of the Institution. This 
progress was retarded only by the lack of sufficient funds for bind- 
ing, for the purchase of many of the books and periodicals requested 
by the curators — publications which could not be obtained by ex- 
change — and for the employment of enough trained workers to 
enable the libraries not merely to meet the daily demands upon 
them, but to carry forward the work of reorganization that was 
begun a few years ago. It is gratifying to report, however, that this 
condition was somewhat relieved by the generous action of the Freer 
Gallery of Ai-t, already mentioned, in allotting funds for use in con- 
nection with the cataloguing of its library; and that it will soon be 
further relieved, for on July 1, 1930, thanks to an increase in the 
Government appropriation to the Smithsonian for library purposes, 
$1,000 more than last year will be available for books and periodicals, 
and two new positions will be provided — namely, for a clerk in the 
exchange office of the library and a senior stenographer in the 
librarian's office. 

But to make it possible for the system fully to meet the needs 
of the Institution, the annual sum for binding and for the ])urchase 
of publications should be further increased, and the stalf should be 
further augmented by at least two cataloguers to revise the cata- 
logue of the museum library and those of other units in the Smith- 
sonian system, to expedite the making of the union catalogue, and 
to render available at the earliest possible moment the thousanils 
of important publications still uncatalogued on the shelves; two 



140 ANNUAL REPOKT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

library assistants for service of a general nature in the sectional 
libraries; a library aid to relieve the more experienced assistants 
of minor library tasks that they are now obliged to perform in addi- 
tion to their regular duties ; and a stack attendant to keep the various 
collections in order, that publications may be found immediately 
when called for by the scientists. When this increased sum is at 
hand and these positions are provided and filled, the library system 
Avill be able to enter more worthily into the opportunity for service 
afforded by its close relation to the work of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution and its branches. 

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT OF THE AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION 

The annual reports of the American Hi-storical Association are 
tran.smittod by the association to the Secretary of the Smithsonian 
Institution and are communicated by him to Congress, as prctvidetl 
by the act of incorporation of the association. 

The annual reports for 11)*2."» and 1\)2G and the supplemental

158 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, IDSU 

The report of the audit of the Smithsonian private funds is printed 
below. 

September 23, 1930. 
Executive Committee, Board of Regents, 

Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D, C. 
Sirs: Pursuant to agreement we have audited the accounts of the Smithsonian 
Institution for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1930, and certifj^ the balance of cash 
on hand June 30, 1930, to be $216,170.17. 

We have verified the record of receipts and disbursements maintained by the 
Institution and the agreement of the book balances with the bank balances. 

We have examined all the securities in the custody of the Institution and in the 
custody of the banks and found them to agree with the book records. 

We have compared the stated income of such securities with the receipts of 
record and found them in agreement therewith. 

We have examined all vouchers covering disbursements for account of the 
Institution during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1930, together with the authority 
therefor and have compared them with the Institution's record of expenditures 
and found them to agree. 

We have examined and verified the accounts of the Institution with each trust 
fund. 

We found the books of account and records well and accurately kept and the 
securities conveniently filed and securely cared for. 

All information requested by your auditors was promptly and courteously 
furnished. 

We certify the balance sheet in our opinion correctly presents the financial 
condition of the Institution as at June 30, 1930.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE 
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 
ENDED JUNE 30. 1930 



ANNUAL MEETING, DECEMBER 12, 1929 

Present: Chief Justice W. 11. Taft, chancellor, in the chair, Senator 
Joseph T. Robinson, Senator Claude A. Swanson, Representative R. 
Walton Moore, Representative Robert Luce, Mr. Frederic A. Delano, 
Mr. Dwight W. Morrow, Mr. Charles E. Hughes, Dr. John C. Mer- 
riam, and the secretary, Dr. C. G. Abbot. Dr. Alexander Wetmore, 
assistant secretary, was also present. 

The secretary announced that Representative Walter H. Newton 
had resigned his seat as a Member of the House on June 30, last, thus 
automatically terminating his appointment as a regent, and that the 
Speaker had appointed Representative Robert Luce as a regent to 
succeed him. 

Mr. Delano, chairman of the executive committee, submitted the 
following customary resolution, which was adopted: 

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 
1931, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the 
secretary, with the advice of the executive committee, with full discretion on the 
part of the secretary as to items. 

The secretary stated that his report for the fiscal year ending Juno 
30, 1929, had been supplied to the regents, and called attention to the 
many interesting and encouraging events of the year. 

At the request of the secretary, Doctor Wetmore explained the 
proposed building program for the Institution. After full discussion, 
the following resolution was adopted: 

Resolved, That the permanent committee be authorized to formulate a program 
to be presented to the Bureau of the Budget, and subsequently transmitted to 
Congress, comprehending the proposed additional buildings needed by the 
Smithsonian Institution. 

The secretary stated that the Smithsonian Scientific Series was 

meeting with gratifying success and that the Institution had already 

received from this source royalties amounting to about S28,000, 

which would increase as time passed. He reminded the board that 

Ambassador Charles G. Dawes had made a grant for the purpose of 

conducting historical studies in European archives and that Dr. 

Charles Upson Clark, an expert, was now engaged in the work and 

had already met with success in his researches.

160 ANNUAT. REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

The annual report of the National Gallery of Art Commission was 
presented. The report was accepted, and the board adopted the 
followdng resolution: 

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution hereby 
approves the recommendation of the National Gallery of Art Commission that 
W. K. Bixby, W. H. Holmes, Herbert L. Pratt, and Charles Borie, be reelected as 
members of the commission for the ensuing term of four years, their present terms 
having expired. 

The annual report of the executive committee was presented and 
accepted. 

The annual report of the permanent committee was submitted. 
This included a sufjgestion for the establishment of a department for 
the arousing of public interest in the Institution and for increasing its 
endowment, which was referred to the permanent committee with 
power to act. 

The matter of the awarding of the Langley medal was next brought 
up, and the following two resolutions were adopted : 

Resolved, That in view of the service rendered to aviation b}' his pioneer con- 
tributions to the development of the airplane engine, the Board of Regents of the 
Smithsonian Institution hereby posthumously awards the Langley gold medal 
for aerodromics to the late Charles Matthews Manly. 

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution award the 
Langley gold medal for aerodromics to Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd, 
United States Nav}', for his pioneer flights over the North and South Poles of 
the earth, his nonstop flight over the Atlantic Ocean, and the scientific discoveries 
associated with these flights. 

MEETING OF FEBRUARY 13, 1930 

Present: Vice President Charles Curtis, Senator Reed Smoot, 
Senator Claude A. Swanson, Representative R. Walton Moore, 
Representative Robert Luce, Mr. Frederic A. Delano, and the secre- 
tary. Dr. C. G. Abbot. Dr. Alexander Wetmore, assistant secretary, 
was also present. 

The secretary announced the resignation of the Hon. William 
Howard Taft as Chief Justice of the United States, stating that this 
action automatically terminated his service as a regent and con- 
sequently as chancellor of the Institution. The following resolutions 
were then adopted: 

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution has 
learned with deep regret of the illness and consequent resignation of its chan- 
cellor, the Hon. William Howard Taft, from the office of Chief Justice of the 
United States, thereby automatically severing his connection with this Board; 

Resolved, That the board hereby expresses its deep sense of the great service 
rendered by Mr. Taft to the Smithsonian Institution, and of the loss in counsel 
and in association which his departure entails; 

Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be communicated to Mr. Taft. 



PROCEEDINGS OP THE REGENTS 161 

Tho secretary further stateil that on DecoTiihcr 10, 1029, the 
Speaker of the House had reMi)p()int(Ml ns ro<routs Representatives 
Alhert Johnson, K. WaUon Moore, and Kohert Lure. 

The secretary recalled to the repents that at the last annual meeting 
their attention had been drawn to the huildinp firojrrani of tho 
Institution, the most ur<;ent item of which was the addition of winj^s 
to the present Natural History Building at an estimated cost of 
$6,500,000, and Doctor Wotmore exhibited blue prints of tlie proposed 
additions. 

The secretary described the work of the new division of radiation 
and orjranisms, and spoke of the interest shown in the Institution 
by the Research Corporation of New York, of which ho is a director. 
He stated that for the past three years the corporation had in each 
year made a grant to the Institution of $15,000 to promote the work 
of the division of radiation and organisms. He also called attention 
to the large sums that had been given by Mr. John A. Roebling to 
the Institution for its work in solar radiation and for other purposes, 
and stated that Mr. Roebling had veiy recently added a fund for the 
purchase of books of reference on the subjects relating to radiation 
investigations. 

SPECIAL MEETING OF MAY 29, 1930 

Present: Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, Senator Joseph 
T. Robinson, Senator Claude A. Swanson, Representative Albert 
Johnson, Representative R. Walton Moore, Representative Robert 
Luce, Mr. Robert S. Brookings, Mr. Frederic A. Delano, Dr. John C. 
Merriam, and the secretary. Dr. C. G. Abbot. Mr. Delano was 
invited to act as temporary chairman. 

The secretary said that the appointment of Mr. Charles Evans 
Hughes as Chief Justice of the United States takes him from the list 
of "citizen" regents who arc appointed for six years, and constitutes 
him under the law an ex oflicio regent with a life tenure. He said 
further that a vacancy existed in the ofTicc of chancellor, and the 
following resolution was adopted: 

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution hereby 
elects the Hon. Charles Evans Hughes, Chief Justice of the United States, as 
chancellor of the Institution. 

The chancellor then took the chair, expressing his appreciation of 
the honor done him. 

The secretary said that in view of the resignation of Chief Justice 
Taft, the Board of Regents, at their meeting of February 13, 1030, 
had adopted resolutions which had been transmitted to the Chief 
Justice, and which had been acknowledged. 



162 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

The secretary spoke of the development of his researches on the 
radiation of the sun, and then called attention to the provisions of 
the new civil service retirement act, which makes possible the con- 
tinuance in the service of the Institution of certain members of the 
staff who would otherwise have to retire on August 20, 1930. 

The secretary stated that beginning in 1911, letters had been re- 
ceived from a Mr. James Arthur, of New York City, asking certain 
information, including problems in mathematics, which had been 
carefully answered. Recently, word had been received that Mr. 
Arthur had bequeathed to the Institution the sum of $75,000, the 
income of which was to be used for (a) the investigation and study of 
the sun; (6) to provide annually a lecture to be known as the James 
Arthur Annual Lecture on the Sun. Mr. Lloyd N. Scott, a director 
and the counsel of the Research Corporation of New York, had been 
designated as the legal representative of the Institution in connec- 
tion with matters pertaining to this bequest. 

The secretary said that the Senate had passed a bill authorizing 
the preparation of plans for the construction of \\dngs on either side 
of the museum building at a cost of $6,500,000. The bill as passed 
was an authorization only, but had not yet been brought before the 
House. On motion, the secretary was requested to prepare a resolu- 
tion embodying the sense of the board as to the urgency of the matter, 
and requesting that the chancellor present the same to the President. 

The secretary added that efforts had been made to fix a date for the 
presentation of the Langley gold medals to Admiral Byrd and (post- 
humously) to Charles M. Manly, but that this had not yet been 
accomplished.

GENERAL APPENDIX 

TO THE 

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1930 



163 



ADVERTISEMENT 

The object of the General Appendix to the Annual Report of the 
the Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific 
discovery in particular directions ; reports of investigations made by 
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character 
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous cor- 
respondents of the Institution. 

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the 
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual 
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more 
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological 
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations 
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this 
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such 
papers as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific 
progress. 

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum- 
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by 
well-known private publishing firms, the secretary had a series of 
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely 
the prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, 
geology, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zool- 
ogy, and anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though, not 
altogether satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888. 

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of 
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them origi- 
nal) embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and 
discussion. This method has been continued in the present report for 
1930.

One result of the widespread use of radio is a «2;eneral funiiliarity 
with two terms wiiich liave h>n<; been houseliohl words ainoiiji!; 
astronomers and i)liysi(ists — wave len<:;th and fiv(iuen(;y. Although 
some vagueness often adheres to the meaning of these words, they 
are exceedingly useful to everyone who uses a radio receiving set. 
What matter if the machinery inside the box is permanently mys- 
terious, provided a scale on the outside allows one to select the sta- 
tion he wishes. We all soon learn the proper scale readings to find 
our favorite stations, and we are accustomed to liear the announcer 
make his routine statement: "This station operates at a frequency 
of so many kilocycles by authority of the Federal Radio Com- 
ndssion." 

In such an ordinary experience as the use of the radio, a point of 
contact is found with the subject of our discussion — Beyond the 
Red in the Spectrum. We shall view this topic in its perspective 
relation to the whole l<nown range of wave lengths, trace a bit of 
the history of its discovery and development, examine some of the 
modern methods of studying it. If some idea is conveyed of the 
reasons why these studies are worth while, our purpose will have 
been in part accomplished. If, in addition, something of the fas- 
cination which attends this kind of work is revealed, so that further 
acquaintance with it appears desirable to you, the results will be 
still more satisfactory. 

Now as to radio waves, most of us arc chiefly interested in the 
ordinary broadcasting which may be received with our familiar 
receiving sets. Such wave lengths, as everyone knows, range from 
oOO meters down to "200 meters — a difTerence corresponding to a little 
over one octave in terms of the musical analogy. Only, instead of 
having just 13 notes in the octave, our radio octave is now divided 
into some 55 specified wave lengths. Outside the reach of the

ordinary receiver, however, other radio waves exist, and all that is 
necessary to intercept them is a receiving set suitably designed. 
Thus we have radio wave lengths ranging from a few meters to 
many kilometers, all liaving the same physical nature and traveling 
through space with the same velocity. 

In order to make more definite the idea of the relative magnitude 
of different wave lengths reference may be made to Figure 1. 
Here is represented the region of the ordinary radio waves, and, 
following along the scale, we find a succession of other types of 
waves, all of which, however, are physically alike, just as all sound 
waves are alike, though differing in pitch. Here you see the place 
occupied by the visible waves, here the ultra-violet and the famous 
cosmic radiation, of which so much is lately heard. This diagram, 
doubtless familiar to many of you, is shown especially to point out 
the location of the particular field selected for discussion — beA'^ond 
the red, but not indefinitely beyond. It also illustrates the fact that 
in a broad sense we are all exceedingly color blind.

English trauslalion by H. S. Uhler. By permission of the D. Van 
Nostrand Co. 

Having seen the setting of our subject, let us consider a little of 
its history. All astronomers honor the name of Sir William Herschel, 
who with his son, Sir John, contributed so much to our knowledge 
of the universe. His enthusiasm, skill, and insight brought rich 
returns. He explored the depths of space with an unprejudiced 
mind, the gift of his Creator, and an excellent telescope, which he 
made for himself. He sought a way to use his poAverful instru- 
ment for visual examination of the sun ; how to avoid the disastrous 
effects of too much heat and light in the eyepiece without sacrificing 
the power of his instrument. This led Sir William to make the 
first investigation of what lies beyond the red in the spectrum of 
sunlight. With a glass prism, three ordinary thermometers, a 
watch, some boards and paper screens, he carried out a remarkable 
series of observations, an account of which he published in the year 
1800 in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of 
London under the title "Investigation of the Powers of the Pris- 
matic Colours to Heat and Illuminate Objects." 

In this paper Herschel gives a most interesting description of his 
experimental work. He relates in detail how one thermometer was 
exposed to the infra-red part of the solar spectrum, while the others 



BEYOND THE RED IN THE SPECTRUM — BABCOCK 167 

were near-by but shaded from the spectrum. By readinj]j all throo 
at rep:ular intervals of time he found that the exposed th(>rinoin<'ter 
rose at a faster rate tiian the others. Pushing the tliermonii'tois 
along the spectrum, he explored a considerable extent of the new 
refrion whicli he had discovered, and ^vas able to learn something 
of the distribution of energy in it. 

Later, by an improvement of this method of study. Sir John 
Hersehel, son of Sir William, continued the examination of the 
invisible spectrum. He concluded tiiat one-half of the sun's heat 
is found in the infra-red part of the spectrum — a result surprisingly 
close to the modern figure of 45 per cent. The important result 
of the Herschels' work was the demonstration that visible radiation 
is only a part of the spectrum, and that nonluminous hot bodies 
have spectra just as those which we can see by their own light. 

Leaving the work of the Herschels, on whicli it would be easy to 
spend all the time available here, we shall next consider the contribu- 
tions of Professor Tyndall, the famous English physicist who lived 
in the middle of the last century. AYith apparatus far more delicate 
than that of his predecessors (though it would appear crude to us 
to-day) he devoted years to a thorough study of the phenomena of 
heat, covering both the visible and the infra-red parts of the 
spectrum. To give an adequate idea of the scope and the importance 
of Tyndall's brilliant experimental work would take far too long. 
It furnished a sure foundation of established facts on which later 
the great theoretical treatment of radiation was to be laid, and it 
still constitutes a rich fund of information. _ Tyndall studied, among 
many other things, the absorbing power of gases for radiation. I 
think he was the first to recognize the remarkable difference in the 
absorbing power exhibited by a mixture of certain molecules and by a 
chemical combination of the same molecules. 

For example, if a certain number of molecules of oxygen are 
mixed with twice as many of hydrogen, the power of tlic mixture to 
absorb infra-red radiation is very small. But if these same molecules 
are combined chemically to form water vapor, the absorptive power 
is much greater. This fact finds a unique explanation in the modern 
theory of molecular structure. 

Another problem which Tyndall undertook to investigate was to 
find the proportion in which the total energy radiated by a hot body 
is divided between visible and obscure portions of its spectrum. 
This proportion is known as the luminous efficiency. For example, 
we have already seen that in the case of the sun the luminous effi- 
ciency is roughly 50 per cent. Tyndall thus greatly extended the 
study of the distribution of energy in the spectrum of a hot body, 
which had been begun by Sir William Herschel. One of Tyndall's 



168 ANNUAL, EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

tUniioiistratioiis, somewhat modified, is illustrated schematically in 
Figure 2. The infra-red radiation emitted by a liot wire is isolated 
by a solution of iodine in carbon bisulphide, which absorbs the visible 
but permits tlie infra-red to pass through. When concentrated at 
the focus of a mirror the invisible radiation ignites a match in a 
few seconds. 

By such means and others, Tyndall was able to find in what pro- 
portion the total energy radiated by a hot body is divided between 
visible and obscure portions. The relation of this proportion to the 
temperature of the body, accurately fornmlated by the tlieoretical 
physicists Wien and Planck, is a most valuable tool for both the 
astronomer and the physicist. Two applications of this idea may be 
noted here. The first is the method of determining stellar or plan- 
etary temperatures hj finding the distribution of energy in their 
spectra. For example, tlie image of a star is formed at the focus of 
a telescope on a tiny receiver which has been blaclcened in order that 
it maj'^ absorb all the radiation which falls on it. Delicate electrical 





MATCH 



Figure -. — Diagram of one of TyndaU's domonstrations. A match 
placed as indicated is quickly ignited by invisible infra-red radiation 
from an electric lamp, although match and lamp are several yards 
apart. L, an electric street lamp ; Mi, M^, concave mirrors ; Fj 
liquid Alter which absorbs visible but transmits infra-red radiation 

devices indicate the slightest change occurring in the temperature 
of the receiver. Filters of various kinds, corresponding to the iodine 
solution indicated in Figure 2, permit the separate measurement of 
visible and invisible radiation and thus the ratio of these quantities 
is obtained, leading to a knowledge of the temperature. 

A second illustration is connected with recent events of world- 
wide interest. When Mr. Edison's golden anniversary was cele- 
brated he once more constructed an electric lamp like his first of 50 
years ago. The contrast between such early lamps and those in com- 
mon use now is indeed striking. The improvements have resulted 
from a knowledge of the distribution of energy between the visible 
and the obscure parts of the spectrum. This has led to the opera- 
tion of modern lamps at far higher temperatures than were formerly 
used, with resultant increase of luminous efficiency. These two 
lamps which I now turn on are consuming nearly the same power. 
One is a type in wide use 20 years ago, the other a modern form. 
It is evident that the brightness of the modern lamp is much greater 
than that of the old one.

of inoan<ioscoiit hodios, but with spootra of diiToront type which are 
proihic'od by atoms and niolooulos actin«!; as individuals. Now atoms 
are in one respect like opera sin<;ers — in their most strikin<]^ and 
individual roles each roqtiires plenty of elbowrooin. Thou<rh the 
analojry is imperfect, the continuous sijoctrum of a jrlowiufj solid 
may he compared to the chorus, while the line spectrum of a luminous 
<;as is more like the son<; of the prima donna, who passes from one 
dep^ree of excitation to another, emittin*;; a rapid succession of musical 
notes like the brilliantly colored linos which individual atoms pro- 
duce, when far enough apart from each other, and suitably stimulated. 

"When closely bound tofrether as in a solid substance, the atoms toll 
us the temperature of the solid, but only little of themselves. When 
the solid is turned to tras by heatinji: it sufliciently, the atoms fjot far 
apart and then have an opportunity to do many thinjrs otherwise 
impossible for them. Thus each kind of atom, whether it be hyilroiren 
or iron, sends out a characteristic spectrum consisting of numerous 
kinds, or colors, of light, each very sharply defined. Some of these 
" colors " are invisible but readily perceptible by instruments suitably 
designed. Each separate color is referred to as a spectral line. The 
supply of names for these colors soon proved inadequate and numbers 
are now used instead. 

I>et us consider the case of hydrogen, with only some 50 or 60 
lines in its spectrum, and think of each atom of the gas, mingled 
with countless others all alike, as a magician having a repertoire of 
tricks. At a given moment each atom can perform just one of its 
various tricks, and the performance, jiractically instantaneous, is to 
produce light of a certain color. A neighboring atom may be per- 
forming a different trick, but it is one of the .same repertoire. The 
combined activities of all the atoms display the whole repertoire. At 
a later time each atom may be doing a different trick from the one 
it formerly showed, but the combined effect is the same as before. 
Each trick corresponds to a line in the spectrum of hj^drogon, and 
the intensity of the line is a measure of the preference which the 
atoms have for certain of their tricks. Every other kind of atom 
such as oxygen, or zinc, has a characteristic repertoire. Each kind 
may be recognized by its spectrum even under diverse conditions. 

Near the beginning of this century a great physicist. Professor 
Planck, to whom we have already referred, formulated a theory of 
radiation which is known as the quantum theory. This important 
work grew out of Planck's study of the total radiation of a solid black 
body. In 1913 Professor Bohr developed an application and exten- 
sion of Planck's theory to the problem of line spectra emitted by iso- 



170 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

lated atoms, and he succeeded in accounting for the known spectrum 
of hydrogen with astonishing accuracy and completeness. By cal- 
culations based on this theory he showed that the known lines of the 
hydrogen spectrum should be precisely where we find them. Further- 
more, he predicted the exact position of other lines which the hydro- 
gen atom should emit, and these were afterward observed precisely 
where he said they should be. This brilliant success was followed by 
a rapid expansion of our understanding of all line spectra and of 
the atoms which give rise to them. 

A basic idea in Bohr's theory of spectra is this : Whenever an atom 
produces one of its characteristic pure colors the energy thus sent 
out in the form of radiation is exactly equal to the energy lost by the 
atom as a result of the rearrangement of its parts. The atom is 
thought of as having a heavy inner part or nucleus, with one or more 
much lighter electrons bound to it by electrical forces. The analogy 
with the structure of the solar system is obvious and to some extent 
helpful, but it must not be carried too far. For example, the planes 
of the planetary orbits lie within a few degrees of each other in the 
solar system, while in the atoms this is not necessarily true. When 
one of the outer electrons in an atom assumes a new position nearer 
to the nucleus the atom accomplishes a definite amount of work, 
and the energy radiated away is the exact equivalent of this work. 
If a weight is allowed to fall from table to floor a certain amount 
of work is done. Its equivalent is found in the heat developed, 
the sound waves set up, and sometimes also in other ways. 

Each line in a spectrum thus signifies the existence of two states 
of the atom in which the internal energy of the atom is different. 
A line whose color is red arises from a transition between two states 
not very different; a line in the ultra-violet, from a transition be- 
tween states having a much greater difference of energy. If your 
baby falls off a footstool he may express his annoyance by a moder- 
ately pitched exclamation; if he falls downstairs he will emit vocal 
sound waves at least an octave higher. The color of a spectral line, 
accurately expressed on a frequency scale, tells exactly the energy 
lost by the atom when it performed one of its tricks. 

The physicist measures the positions ; i. e., the " colors," to speak 
loosely, of the spectral lines with an accuracy almost unbelievable; 
he notes the relative intensities of the lines, their individual peculi- 
arities such as sharpness or diffuseness, their varying behavior under 
change of conditions surrounding the source of light, such as pres- 
ence or absence of a magnetic field ; and gradually he learns, for each 
kind of atom, the sj^stem of energy-states which it possesses. These 
energy-states, or spectral terms as they are called, are less numerous 
than the lines in the spectrum, and are far more significant of the 



BEYOND THE RED IN THE SPECTRUM — BABCOCK 171 

nature of the utoiu. TliUiJ in the spectrum of neon some 900 lines 
represent transitions between only liG spectial terms. 

These terms or energy -states themselves correspond to dillerent 
arrangements of the electrons which make up the outer part of 
the atom. Thus a knowledge of the terms, which is derived from 
the observed spectral lines, brings us some definite idea of the 
mechanics of the atom. 

The })eriodic table was long ago recognized by chemists as express- 
ing some fundamental relations between the elements. By compari- 
son of the spectra of elements adjacent in this table, the physicist is 
now able to trace, in part at least, the gradual increase in mechanical 
complexity of the atoms with their increase of weight. The most 
fundamental physical and chemical relationships are thus clarified, 
and man's mastery of his environment is delinilely increased. 

This digression from the infra-red part of the spectrum has been 
necessary in order to show in some fashion what the spectroscopist 
is trying to do, regardless of the spectral region in which he works. 
As we have seen, the object is to obtain, by a study of its spectral 
lines, as complete a picture as possible of the system of terms 
associated with each kind of atom and from these to derive the 
structure of the atom. To do this a large range of wave-lengths 
must be examined; it is not sufficient to measure just the blue part 
of the iron spectrum and attempt to find all the terms from the lines 
shown there, for terms may exist whose combinations give no blue 
lines at all. Even the entire visible spectrum is inadequate, and it 
becomes necessary to study the ultra-violet and the infra-red in order 
to fill in all the details. 

These are some of the reasons which justify the activities of the 
spectroscopist and warrant his efforts to extend the photographic 
study of atomic spectra into the infra-red. Two other promising 
fields of study also invite the more detailed exploration of the region 
of longer wave lengths, namely the sj^ectra which are characteristic 
of molecules as distinguished from atoms, and the solar spectrum. 
The complexity of molecules as compared to atoms is obvious, since a 
molecule is a cluster of two or more atoms which have approached 
each other close enough to form a partnership. Indeed the struc- 
tural complexity is reflected in the spectra which molecules give. 
Such spectra present many individual lines corresponding to a single 
electronic transition in the molecule, because the atoms which make 
up the molecule are free to rotate and to vibrate with respect to the 
center of mass, and each of these possibilities is utilized every time 
the electrons are rearranged. Thus the sjicctra of molecules have 
furnished information (;f the utmost importance to the chemist as 
well as to the physicist. For example, accurate determinations of 



172 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

the distance between the two nuclei in a diatomic molecule, of the 
moment of inertia of the molecule, of its heat of dissociation, as Avell 
as the discovery of isotopic forms of the atoms and the calculation 
of their masses are all possible in favorable cases where the band 
spectra are suitable for precise measurement. To interpret the value 
of each of these results, which have actually been obtained for oxy- 
gen molecules, would lead us far into fields remote from our topic. 
To apply improved methods of observing the infra-red region of 
molecular spectra is bound to aid in developing this rapidly expand- 
ing department of spectroscopy. 

We are thus brought to the third field of large-scale spectroscopy, 
namely, the study of the solar spectrum. Here we pause to pay 
respect to the genius of Professor Rowland of Johns Hopkins Uni- 
versity, who carried out a remarkable investigation of the visible and 
ultra-violet parts of the solar spectrum, which has been a storehouse 
of information for 30 years. Some 20,000 spectral lines were meas- 
ured and described with an accuracy only recently surpassed. There 
is no doubt that Rowland would have extended his researches into 
the infra-red part of the spectrum if he had possessed photographic 
plates which would respond to such radiation. 

For years it has been comparatively easy to photograph much of 
the ultra-violet and all of the visible region of the spectrum, and the 
method of photographic spectroscopy has proved superior to all other 
ways of determining the exact positions and characters of spectral 
lines. As we go beyond the visible red, however, the photographic 
process becomes increasingly difficult and finally has to be replaced 
by the thermometric method. 

The thermometric method, as its name implies, depends on meas- 
urement of the heating power of radiation. For this purpose three 
types of instrument are in use, two of which utilize electrical effects 
and the other, a mechanical effect of the radiation. Instruments of 
the first two kinds are called bolometers and thermocouples, while 
the third is known as a radiometer — and has been seen by every one 
in the windows of opticians and jewelers. 

It would be interesting to describe the working of these marvelous 
devices and to show the results which they produce. It must suffice 
to consider briefly the application of the bolometer to the study of the 
solar spectrum. This instrument was invented by Professor Langley 
at the Allegheny Observatory in 1881. Subsequently as Secretary of 
the Smithsonian Institution he used it with the assistance of Dr. C. 
G. Abbot, the present secretary, to explore in detail the infra-red 
solar spectrum. In the 30 years following the publication of this 
great work, Doctor Abbot has continued to improve the instrument 
and to apply it in a scries of brilliant researches. During the past 
year, with tlie assistance of Mr. Freeman, Doctor Abbot has published 



BEYOND THE BED IN THE SPECTRUM — BABCOCK 173 

the latest measurements of this part of the sohir spoctruni fiimi 
observations made l\v them at Mount Wilson in IU'28. 

The bolometer depends on the chan<;e of electrical resistance shown 
by a metal whose temperature is varied. A delicate electrical record- 
ing; device draws a continuous curve whose ordinates indicate the 
temperature of a hairlike filament of blackened platinum, across 
which the solar spectrum is made to pass. Figure 3 shows such a 
curve obtained by Doctor Abbot. The electrical connections are so 
made that wlien the curve dips down it means that the filament 
became cooler. Thus these notches mean dark lines or bands inter- 
ruptinp: the continuity of the spectrum, exactly similar to the well- 
known Fraunhofer lines in the visible spectrum of the sun. The wave 
len<j:ths here recorded are from a7X)00 at one end to about A20,000 
at the other. The thermometric method is capable, as you see, of 
working over an enormous range of wave lengths, greater in fact 
than the photographic method. It has another advantage in that

Dr. C. G. Abbot. Beginning nt tJie left wltli very doop red vi.«ihle 
radiation, the curve extends to tlie right far beyond the limits of 
visibility and also beyond tho [irpscnt limit of photography 

it gives, more directly than the photographic method, the intensity' 
of the radiation at each point in the spectrum. On the other hand 
photography permits the observation of finer details than the ther- 
mometric method, and leads to higher accuracy. A real advantage 
is found, therefore, in observing, in so far as possible, the same part 
of the solar spectrum by both the thermometric and the photo- 
graphic methods. The greater accuracy of photograj)hy serves to 
calibrate the wave-length scale of the bolometer, while the bolometric 
record shows that the spectral lines recorded by the photographs are 
real and not .spurious effects introduced by the apparatus. 

Nearly 50 years ago Sir William Abney photographed the invisible 
solar spectrum as far as the point indicated on the curve — a0,867. 
Attempts to extend his work have failed, although a few years ago 
Dr. F. S. Brackett, then at the Mount Wilson Observatory, succeeded 
in reaching a i)oint just short of Abney's limit. We shall now con- 
sider some recent advances in the pliotographic method which iiave 
made it possible to use it as far as All,634. 



174 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

Abney obtained his results with a special form of silver bromide 
which had the power of absorbing red and infra-red radiation; he 
used no dyes. Pie prepared his own photographic plates shortly be- 
fore use by an elaborate process which he described in detail. But 
his process is troublesome and uncertain. It has never been seriously 
applied to modern spectroscopy, although the resources of the present 
chemical laboratory would perhaps warrant a revival of it. Since 
Abney's day, photographic chemistry has been more concerned with 
ordinary silver bromide, which of itself absorbs only blue, violet, 
and ultra-violet light. To make this bromide useful for longer wave 
lengths, dyes are added to the emulsion which, by their absorption 
of the yellow, red, or infra-red, are designed to confer sensitivity 
to those kinds of radiation. This is the method used in preparing 
panchromatic emulsions with which many of you are no doubt famil- 
iar. Commercial needs have so stimulated the perfection of such 
emulsions that those now obtainable are of excellent quality. For 
the infra-red, however, the commercial requirements have not been 
so great and progress has been much slower. For many years only 
one useful dye was known for this region. It is called dicyanine 
and it was with this that Doctor Brackett obtained his excellent 
results some years ago. Lately, however, the motion-picture indus- 
try developed a need for emulsions which would permit the taking 
of night scenes in daj'time, since great expense could thus be saved. 
Now it turns out that a picture made with infra-red light under 
ordinary daylight conditions looks very much as though it has been 
made at night. In such a picture the sky, for example, is dark in- 
stead of light. (See pi. 1.) Perhaps then, the spectroscopist owes 
something to the movies for the fact that not long ago two new dyes 
were produced by the Eastman Kodak Laboratory under Doctor 
Mees's direction. One of these is particularly important for our 
purpose, and it is the outcome of using it that we shall now hear. 
This new dye is called neocyanine. It is produced in the form of 
beautiful red crystals which are soluble in alcohol. An ordinary 
photographic plate soaked in this solution acquires infra-red sensi- 
tivity far beyond that obtainable with other dyes. It has thus be- 
come feasible to use instrumental power which is comparable with 
that employed in the visible part of the spectrum and sufficient to 
bring out a wealth of detail beyond the power of the thermometric 
methods. 

For this purpose the solar spectrum is formed by an optical 
instrument called a concave grating, especially constructed to give 
exceptional brightness to the spectrum. A small image of the sun 
is formed on the slit of the spectrograph which is covered by a 
filter. This stops the visible light and transmits only the invisible 



BEYOND THE RED IN THE SPEOTBUM — BABCOCK 175 

infra-red rays. The plate is exposed to these about 7 hours aiul 
then developed in total darkness. Perhaps you can iiiia«;ine the 
impatience with which the observer waits while the plate lixes sulU- 
ciently to permit a glimpse in weak light to see whether he got 
anything on it or not. 

It turns out that just twice as much of the solar spectrum can 
now be studied by photography as in the day of Professor Rowland, 
with the result that hundreds of spectral lines produced by atoms 
in the sun's atmosphere are being accurately measured for the first 
time. From what has been said about the significance of a line 
in the spectrum it will be evident that such new data are valuable 
to the physicist as well as to the astronomer. The physicist sees 
in the sun's atmosphere a laboratory in which about two-thirds of 
the elements known on earth are trying to tell him the story of their 
structure. The astronomer sees new opportunities to examine the 
constitution of our nearest star and so to understand what all stars 
are like. 

Carbon is an element abundant in the earth. We should expect 
it to be abundant in the sun also, since the best tests we can make 
indicate that the earth is a fair chemical sample of the material 
universe. Hitherto the only evidence for the presence of atomic 
carbon in the sun has been found in nine faint lines in the visible 
part of the spectrum. Although doubtless conclusive, this evidence 
is not very impressive when compared to that for other equally 
abundant elements. The fact is that throughout the visible and near 
ultra-violet region, carbon atoms have no strong lines and only a 
few w'eak ones. When studied in the electric arc, however, the 
carbon atom is known to produce a group of very strong lines in the 
infra-red. The new solar spectrograms show these same lines; but 
since the accuracy here is greater than in the case of the electric 
arc, the solar data more completely correspond with tlie predictions 
of the atomic theory than do those of the laboratory. 

Perhaps we have talked of too many things in the course of the 
hour, and some of them were not interesting to you. But, although 
tiresome details may soon be forgotten, some general impressions 
may remain. One which I should like to leave with you in closing 
is that of the continuity of scientific progress. Some writers who 
interpret scientific news in popular magazines and in newspaper 
articles emphasize what they call the revolutionary discoveries and 
theories of recent years. This no doubt attracts the eye of the 
general reader, and at any rate reminds him that science is alive, 
liut a much truer perspective is had by omitting just one letter in 
such headlines and thus bringing out the fact that most important 
scientific advances are evolutionary in character, not revolutionary. 



176 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

Illustrations abound on every hand, but the subject of our discussion 
here is apropos. The Herschels, father and son, Tyndall, Bunsen, 
Kirchoff, Wien, Planck, Bohr, and, preceding these, Newton, form 
a succession no one of whom overthrew the work of his predecessors. 
Instead, before each one saw a little deeper into the pure spring of 
truth, he first established himself on the foundation already laid 
for his use. Einstein does not overthrow Newton; he adds to 
Newton's truth. 
Listen to Alfred Noyes, writing of Newton : 

" If I saw farther, 'twas because I stood 

On Giant shoulders," wrote the king of thought, 

Too proud of his great line to slight the toils 

Of his forebears. He turned to their dim past. 

Their fading victories and their fond defeats, 

And knelt as at an altar, drawing all 

Their strengths into his own ; and so went forth 

With all their glory shining in his face, 

To win new victories for the age to come. 

So, where Copernicus had destroyed the dream 
We called our world ; where Galileo watched 
Those ancient firmaments melt, a thin blue smoke 
Into a vaster night ; where Kepler heard 

Only stray fragments, isolated chords 
Of that tremendous music wliich slioiild bind 
All things anew in one, Newton arose 
And carried on their fire. 

* * * he oauglit 
The sunbeam striking through that bullet-hole 
In his closed shuttei'- — a round white spot of light 
Upon a small dark screen. He interposed 
A prism of glass. He saw the sunbeam break 
And spread upon the screen its rainbow band 
Of disentangled colours, till in scale 
Like notes in music ; first the violet ray, 
Then indigo, trembling softly into blue. 
Then green and yellow, ciuiveriiig side by side; 
Then orange, mellowing richly into red. 

Here Newton stopped; and here Herschel began the long- 
continued, still progressing, siglitless but not unseeing search. 
Beyond the lied in the Spectrum.

GROWTH IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUN 



By Charles E. St. John 



[With 7 plates] 



The ilifToroiu'es botwoon tho two r('i)resentatioTis of tho sun (pi. 1) 
show graphically the wide conti-ast between the appearance of the 
sun as observed and imagined in 1C35, and as photographed nearly 
300 years later as a composite of spectroheliograms of disk and 
ciiromosphere. 

The gulf between the past and the present knowledge of the sun 
has been bridged in comparatively recent years, almost within the 
lifetime of men now living. 

Though absorption lines in the solar spectrum were first observed 
by Wollaston in 1802 and catalogued to the number of 576 by Fraun- 
hofer in 1814. the real beginning of astrophysics dates from Kirch- 
off's great discovery, in 1859, of the true interpretation of the Fraun- 
hofer lines. The application of spectroscopic analysis to astronomi- 
cal problems opened broad vistas to active and progressive spirits. 
Huggins says, "The news of Kirchoff's discovery was to me like 
coming upon a spring of water in a dry and thirst}' land." The first 
triumplis of the spectroscope were won by its application to the sun. 
It is interesting to note, however, that in the hands of Huggins and 
Draper the novel method of research was e.xtended to stars, nebulae, 
and comets with great success before further uses were found for it 
in solar work. 

I.ockyer and Janssen in 18G8 made a great advance through their 
indej)endent observations that the blood-red chi'omosphere and 
prominences, hitherto seen only during a total eclipse of the sun, are 
gaseous and owe their redness to the emission of the red line of 
liydrogen; and by the discovery of helium in the sun a quarter of a 
century before it was traced to an earthly source. A romantic touch 
was thus given to the study of the sun.

COMPOSITION OF SUN'S ATMOSPHERE 

The identification of solar lines with those of the known terrestrial 
elements, begun by Kirchoif, was taken up by Rowland, whose ex- 
tensive findings were incorporated in his Preliminary Table of Solar 
Spectrum "Wave Lengths, published in 189G. For a third of a cen- 
tury this has been the world's standard, and the vade-mecum of 
astronomers, chemists, and physicists. In the Revision'^ recently 
completed at Mount Wilson Observatory, the original identifications 
have been checked and corrected by the use of all available data con- 
jointly with modern astrophysical theory and the results of spectrum 
analysis. Nearly all, viz. 35, of the elements recognized or suggested 
by Rowland as present in the sun, have survived the critical examina- 
tion and retain their place as components of the sun's atmosphere. 
To these, 2G have been added, so that 61 of the 90 known elements 
are represented with varying degrees of probability. Of particular 
interest and importance among the results of the Revision are the 
identification of the nonmetallic elements — carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, 
and sulphur in the atomic state; the large proportion of the metals 
occurring in both the neutral and ionized states; the complete ioniza- 
tion of the rare-earth metals; and the importance of the role of 
excitation potential. 

The identification rests upon reasonable correspondence between 
the positions of solar and laboratory lines, so-called coincidence. For 
iron this is shown in Plate 2, Figure 1, at A, where it is seen that the 
bright arc lines of iron are well represented in the sun's spectrum. 
This is a reproduction of a spectrogram made by simultaneous ex- 
posures to the center of the sun and to the luminous vapor between 
the two poles of an iron arc. 

Identifications are furnished also by flash spectra. When the sun's 
disk is covered by the moon at a total eclipse only the glowing gases 
of the sun's atmosphere are exposed to view beyond the moon's edge. 
These then give bright lines which, except in the case of helium, are 
the reversals of the dark Fraunhofer lines. This may be seen in 
Plate 3, for the strong iron triplet AA4,045, 4,063, 4,071. Normally 
helium gives bright lines which appear only in flash and prominence 
spectra. The helium line A4,026 is conspicuous in the reproduction. 

The symbols of the 90 known chemical elements are given in 
Table I.

Those in parentheses are as yet unidentified in the sun's atmos- 
phere. This does not necessarily mean that these unidentified ele- 
ments are absent. For some elements the lines of lowest excitation 
potential, the resonance lines, are far in the ultra-violet beyond the 
accessible regions in both stellar and solar spectra. A layer of 
ozone situated some 50 miles above the earth's surface absorbs the 
radiations to the violet of a2,975 A. The strong resonance lines of 
the neon and fluorine groups are in this region. The question marks 
mean that the evidence is not strong and that exact laboratory wave 
lengths are wanting as in the case of osmium and iridium. Even- 
tually such elements will be found to be definitely present or absent. 
Ninety of the ninety-two possible elements have been found on the 
earth. The heavy elements in the bottom line are all radioactive. 



180 ANNUAL KEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

The end results of the radioactive changes are helium and lead which 
are being formed continually from their ultimate sources, thorium 
and uranium, through the more highl}^ radioactive elements in the 
series of transformations. That these do not appear in the sun may 
be due in part to their radioactive degeneration, and the ending of 
the series of elements Avith uranium, at No. 92, the heaviest element, 
may be due to the disappearance of possibly heavier elements through 
their radioactivity, so that we have left the more stable ones which 
have proA^ed the fittest to survive. 

ASTROPHYSICS 

The methods introduced by Huggins and Lockyer of interpreting 
astronomical spectra through observations in the physical laboratory 
led to the development of astrophysics, as a branch of physical 
science. Confirmation of the soundness and fruitfulness of these 
methods could be drawn from many sides. An outstanding illustra- 
tion is the Avork of Hale and his co-workers, who have brought us to 
the present view of the constitution of sun spots as great vortices 
whose centers are magnetic fields which may in the larger spots reach 
intensities of 4,000 gausses OA^er areas of many millions of square 
miles. 

MAGNETIC FIELDS IN SUN SPOTS 

Many lines in the spectra of sun spots taken with sufficiently high 
dispersion are doubled or tripled, depending upon the strength of 
the magnetic field and the angle between the lines of force and the 
path of the light. The components of the doublets were found by 
Hale to be circularly polarized in opposite directions. In the lab- 
oratory similar doubling with circular polarization of the compo- 
nents is obserA^ed when the light source is placed between the poles 
of a powerful magnet and the light emitted by a spectrum line is 
viewed in a direction parallel to the lines of the magnetic field. 
Viewed in any other direction, the line is a triplet, the middle com- 
ponent plane, and the two side components ellipticall}^ polarized; 
except Avhen normal to the field, when the two side components are 
plane polarized at right angles to the plane of the central compo- 
nent. The illustration (pi. 4, fig. 1) shoAvs the Fe line, A6,173, photo- 
graphed as an absorption line in a sun spot and as an emission 
line in the laborator}^ (the insert). The horizontal bands are due 
to quarter-Avavc mica strips witli their optical axes at right angles 
to each other in the alternate bands. These change the circular or 
elliptical vibration of the side components into plane vibrations at 
right angles to each other in the alternate bands. A Nicol prism in 
the optical train cuts out the blue and transmits the red (side) com- 



KNOWT.EDGE OF THE SUN — ST. JOHN 181 

ponent in one strip ami cuts out tho rod and transmits tlic blue 
component in the following? strip and so on alternately, producing 
tho stajrirerod eirpct. In tho case shown, the li'j^ht from the si)ot was 
not viewed exactly parallel to the lines of the magnetic field, hence 
there is a wetdc middle component, while in the laboratory observa- 
tion there is no central coini)onont. tho line of si<;ht in this case being 
parallel to the lines of the magnetic field. As the separation of tho 
components observed in the laboratory for a given line is propor- 
tional to the strength of the magnetic field, tho intensity of the field 
in a spot is deducible from the separation of the components of the 
same line in its spectrum. The magnetic fields in sun spots are 
attributed to the rapid rotation of electrically charged particles in 
deep-seated vortices in which the gases are in cyclonic rotation. 
The low temperature, some 2,000° C. below that of the general sur- 
face, was fii-st shown by interpreting the difTerencos between the 
spectra of the photosphere and the spot umbra in terms of laboratory 
observations, and was later deduced from the theory of ionization. 
The polarity of the loading spot in a bipolar group in the North- 
ern Hemisphere is opposite to that of the leading si)ot in the South- 
ern Hemisphere, during a given 11-year cycle. The polarities re- 
verse at the beginning of each new spot-cycle, the complete magnetic 
period being double that between spot minima. The general mag- 
netic field of the sun is relatively weak but was detected by methods 
similar to those applied to spots, although still more refined measures 
were necessary. It has an intensity at low levels in the reversing 
layer of 50 gausses. The magnetic axis is 4° from the sun's axis of 
rotation and revolves around it in 31.5 days. 

DOPPLER EFFECTS 

Lockyer's use of the Doppler principle to explain the distortions 
of bright chromospheric lines was the first introduction of it into 
solar investigation, where it has played a preeminent role. 

It has been applied to determining the rotation of the sun by 
photographing in juxtaposition the spectra of the east and west 
edges of the sun. (PI. '2, lig. 2.) The center strip is from the east 
limb and the two outer from the west limb. A careful examination 
will show that the Fraunhofer lines from the east and west limbs 
are nmtually displaced. The displacement at the cast limb to shorter 
wave length indicates that the eastern equatorial edge of the sun is 
approaching the observer with a velocity of 2 km/sec. and that 
therefore the sun rotates on its axis once in about 25 days. 

A solar spectrum shows dark lines due to absorption by oxygen 
and water vapor in the earth's atmosphere. These atmospheric lines 

28U95— 31 13

are not displaced and thus may be distinguished from true solar 
lines. A spectrum of the impressive B group of atmospheric oxy- 
gen is reproduced in Plate 5, Figure 1. These lines coincide in the 
spectra of the east and west limbs while the solar lines are mutually 
displaced. 

In the case of sun spots, it has made it possible to build up a pic- 
ture of the motions of the surrounding vapors and to fathom the

Observatory gave the data for a more complete analysis of the 
motions. 

The results are graphically given in the accompanying diagram 
(fig. 1), which shows a vertical section of the surroundings of a 
spot, the axis of the vortex lying in the ])lane of the paper. Im- 
mediately above the shaded umbra, the gases in which the low-level 
lines of iron and those of the heav}' elements originate are flowing 
outward with velocities proportional to the lengths of the heavy 
lines. At higher levels the velocity of outflow decreases and be- 
comes zero for the strongest and highest-level lines of iron, the 
level of velocity -inversion lying at about 1,200 km. Above this 
level the motion is inward, the velocity increasing with height. The 
field-forming vortex is below the level of the umbra and in it the 
gases are rising as in a terrestrial tornado and spreading outward 
above the photosphere. The high-level cliromosi)here layers tend 
to settle, owing to the decreased pressure of radiation over the spot 
caused by the cooling of the expanding gases, and form a secondary 
vortex, in which the flow, as shown by Doppler displacement, is 
inward. The magnetic lines of force are indicated in the usual way 
jis if diverging from the pole of a magnet. As seen from the earth 
in the red light of hydrogen the high-lying cyclone appears as in 
Plate 4, Figure 2, which pictures a horizontal cross section of it. 

ORIGIN OV FRAUNHOFER LINES 

Spectrum lines are due to transitions between two energ}?^ states of 
an atom, the frejpiency of the emitted or absorbed radiation being 
exactly proportional to the difference in energy between the two 
states. Every absorption line is associated with the transition from 
one energy state to another of higher energy content and can only be 
produced when the atom is already excited to the lower energy state 
of the transition to which the line is due, measured by the excita- 
tion jxjtential expressed in volts. The absorbed energy, hv, corre- 
sponding to the line is diffusely scattered or reradiated without change 
of wave length. This alone would give completely black lines, but 
the effect of collisions of the "second kind" is to supply radiation 
to the middle of the line so that none are completely black; this 
residual intensity is what makes tiie spectroheliogiam possible. 

LEVELS 

Lines in the solar spectrum give informatitm of the conditions ob- 
taining in the region of their origin. Like infornuition concerning 
the conditions is given by lines originating in the same layer, but

the behavor of lines from different layers reveals characteristic differ- 
ences. This is shown particularly well in studies of solar rotation 
and by the currents observed in the gases in the immediate 
neighborhood of spots.

When the linear equatorial velocity of rotation given by iron 
lines of medium intensity is taken for reference, the velocity given 
by Ca+ is 0.2 km/sec. greater, with lower velocities for Ha, Ca 4227, 
and high-level iron, corresponding to their separate and lower levels, 
the lowest velocity being given by lines originating immediately 
above the photosphere. The same arrangement of the levels is given 
by the flow near spots, high velocity inw^ard, 1.80 km/sec. for Ca4-, 
decreasing to zero for high-level Fe, and rising to maximum velocity 
outward for the lines of lowest level. A like correlation is shown by 
the heights taken from eclipse observations. 

CONSTITUTION OF THE SUN 

The present view conceives it as a completely gaseous sphere. For 
the sun, built on the Eddington model, in which the radiation pres- 
sure is a constant fraction of the total pressure, the temperature at 
the center would be of the order of 29,000,000° K. The atoms in 
the interior are highly ionized, but are not destroyed or transformed 
into other elements, the only changes being the removal, more or 
less complete, of the orbital electrons. The mean molecular weight 
of the mixture of free electrons and nuclei is taken as 2.11. The 
pressure in the deepest interior, 30,000,000,000 atmospheres, is so 



KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUN ST. JOHN 185 

great that even at the hi^h temperature the density is estimated to 
be approximately twenty-ei<]:ht times that of water, though tiie mean 
density is only 1.4. The radiation pressure bears a very appreciable 
ratio to the weight of the superincumbent material. 

The photosphere is a relatively thin gaseous shell, through which 
radiation from tiie interior does not pass directly, its optical opacity 
being due to its highly ionized state (Stewart). The temperature of 
its surface is api)roximately 0,000° K, and the pressure there a 
thousandtii of an atnjosphere. The total mass (»f the overlying gases 
according to Russell is approximately 10'" tons. The mass of the 
earth's atmosphere is three times as great, but on the sun the pressure 
(mass X solar gravity) is distributed over an area twelve thousand 
times greater. As the sun's atmosphere is approximately 10- times 
as deep, its volume is 12X10^^ as large, hence its average density is 
extremely small, about 2X10"^^ 

The reversing layer is a few hundred kilometers in thickness and 
contains all the elements found in the sun's atmosphere. In it the 
vast majority of the Fraunhofer lines originate. It is supported be- 
low mainly by gas pressure but above increasingly by the pressure of 
radiation. The reversing la3'er merges gradually into the chromo- 
sphere, which reaches 12,000-14,000 kilometers in height, and is sup- 
ported by radiation pressure. The eclipse spectra of the chromo- 
sphere (pi. 3) show conspicuously the emission lines of the lighter 
gases, hydrogen and helium, and of ionized elements such as Ca + 
and Ti + . The pressure at the top of the Ca + atmosphere is of the 
order of 10" atmosphere (Milne) and at the photosphere 10"^ atmo- 
sphere (St. John and Babcock). 

Prominences are luminous vapors, mainly hydrogen and ionized 
calcium, that often rise above the chromosphere to gi'cat heights, 
reaching at times to more than half the solar radius. (PI. 0, fig. 1.) 
Formerly these were observed only at times of total eclipse of the 
sun, but now are photographed daily with the spectroheliograph. 
Their composition is known but there remains much to be explained 
as to the forces that originate and support them and control their 
movements. Dark masses of hydrogen are often photographed on the 
disk of the sun. (PI. 0, fig. 2.) They were long suspected to bo 
prominences seen in projection on the disk. This relation to promi- 
nences became clear through such fortunate observations as shown 
in Plate 7, Figure 1, where a dark hydrogen cloud was caught being 
carried off the disk by the sun's rotation and later in Plate 7, Figure 
2. when completely off the disk and bright. The motions of bolh 
dark and bright hydrogen flocculi are now visually studied by means 
of the spectrohelio.scope recently developed by Hale. 



186 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

The corona gives a continuous spectrum in which absorption lines 
show faintly and upon which a bright line spectrum is superposed. 
The former is ascribed to reflected or scattered sunlight, the latter to 
an unidentified gaseous element considered formerly to be a 
hypothetical element, coronium, but now thought to be due to some 
known element peculiarly excited. The periodic table of the elements 
based upon atomic theory has no place for such a hypothetical gas. 
The recent identification by Bowen of the hypothetical nebulium lines 
with the " forbidden " lines of oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur, whose 
production is favored by the extremely low density in nebulae, points 
to a similar explanation for coronium. 

RADIATION AND AGE OF THE SUN 

The solar radiation at the mean distance of the earth from the 
sun is 1.94 calories per minute per square centimeter. It is subject 
to variation over the 11-year spot-cycle, being about 2 per cent above 
the mean when spots are most plentiful. Variations with periods 
of a few days may reach 3 per cent (Abbot). The total radiation 
from the sun is 38 X 10 ^^ ergs per second. Since pre-Cambrian times 
the sun has been radiating at approximately this rate. This implies 
a subatomic source of energy within the sun, the transformation of 
hydrogen into helium, the annihilation of matter (Jeans), or radio- 
active elements of higher atomic weight than uranium. In modern 
theory the output of solar energy is equivalent to a loss in mass of 
4,200,000 tons per second. Even at this enormous rate it would re- 
quire fifteen thousand billion years for the transformation into en- 
ergy of a mass equal to that of the sun. The widely accepted value 
for the age of the earth derived from the radioactive content of the 
oldest rocks is of the order of sixteen hundred million years. On the 
assumption that the planets are the offspring of the sun's early years, 
a minimum age of two thousand million years is found for the sun 
(Nernst). 

Recently Milne has rediscussed the internal structure of stars and 
finds that a star tends to generate a kind of " white dwarf " at its 
center surrounded by a gaseous distribution of more familiar type; 
the star being like the yolk in an egg. He concludes that in the in- 
tensely hot, intensely dense, nucleus, the temperatures and densities 
are high enough for the transformation of matter to take place with 
ease and that in this nucleus we must look for the origin of stellar 

energy.

and later introduced independently at Mount Wilson. The first 
column shows certain typical chemical components at various levels. 



188 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

In sounding the sun's atmosphere from the outside, one would, on 
passing through the corona, encounter an atmosphere of ionized 
calcium; to this would be added at successively lower levels, hydro- 
gen, ionized titanium, sodium, normal calcium, and then other ele- 
ments in rapid succession until at the photospheric level all constitu- 
ents would be present. Helium, probably because of its high exci- 
tation potential, does not appear as an absorption line in the solar 
spectrum, except over the more actively disturbed areas. It is promi- 
nent in eclipse spectra and extends to a height of 8,000 km. 

In the second column, the cyclonic whirls in the upper chro- 
mosphere are indicated by circles. These secondary high-level 
vortices are probably called into existence through the low tem- 
perature of the underlying spot umbra, either as a result of the 
cooling of the lower chromosphere causing a down rush, or more 
directly as the result of a decrease in the radiation pressure by 
which the chromosphere is supported. As a rule, the direction of 
these high-level whirls corresponds in all sun-spot cycles to the 
terrestrial law, counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and 
clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. For the underlying vortices 
constituting the sun spots, the whirls are below the photosphere and 
their directions are unknown. Since the magnetic polarity is 
opposite in Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and reverses at 
each spot minimum, we may infer that change of polarity corre- 
sponds to change in the direction of the whirl in the field-forming 
vortex (Hale). The directions of the whirls in the upper and lower 
vortices are independent of each other. In the same column the 
length of the arrows is proportional to velocity of How, and their 
directions correspond to the inward and outward motions at high 
and low levels, respectively. 

In the third column (disk) displacements of high-level lines to 
the red and of low-level lines to the violet relative to lines of medium 
level, are similar to displacements that occur in stellar spectra and 
appear to be a general characteristic of stellar atmospheres, their 
magnitude increasing with the temperature of the star. The dis- 
placements for the sun are consistent with its position in the evolu- 
tionary sequence. As to the displacements of high-level lines to the 
red expressed in their equivalent (Doppler velocity in the third 
column of Figure 2), the following considerations offer a probable 
interpretation. The increase in width of H and K above 8,000 km 
indicates high ionic agitation. After emission, it is probable that 
some of these atoms will possess large outward velocities, and hence 
the next absorption will be from the violet side of the absorption 
line, where the radiation is much stronger than at the center. Con- 
secutive emissions and absorptions will therefore endow these atoms 
with an increasing outward acceleration, and it is possible that some 



KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUN — ST. JOHN 189 

will eventually escape from the sun with enormous velocities. Tlie 
velocities of tlesceiit are hardly likely to exceed the velocities of 
thermal agitation. When the Fraunliofer spectrum is observed, 
there are therefore more atoms absorbing from the red wing than 
from the violet. Hence the absorption line will appear displaced to 
the red, and this feature should become more prominent with in- 
creasing height (Milne, Merfield). The displacements to the violet 
at low levels seem explicable by the upward streaming of gases near 
the photosphere. 

The last three columns show respectively the very low pressure 
in the sun's atmosphere by which the sun again shows its similarity 
to the stars, the rotation at dili'erent levels, and tlie heights to which 
the different gases rise as derived from the eclipse observations. 

RELATIVITY 

The question of the gravitational displacement of the Fraunhofer 
lines predicted by the general theory of relativity has been a subject 
of extended investigation, with the result that when other known 
characteristic displacements in stellar atmospheres are taken into 
consideration the remaining displacements to the red universally 
observed are most satisfactorily interpreted in accordance with that 
theory (Evershed, St. John). The interpretation is reinforced by 
the observed eflfect in the " white dwarf " companion of Sirius by 
Adams and Moore. 

This brief outline of the progress in our understanding of the 
sun illustrates the wide-reaching results in astrophysical investiga- 
tions from the union between spectroscopic observations on the sim, 
work in the physical laboratory, and deductions from atomic theory, 
and perhaps justifies the claim of astrophysics that it deals with 
the most interesting questions of physical research.

THE MODERN SUN CULT ' 



By J. W. Stubmeb 
Dean of Science, Philadelpfiia College of Pharmacy and Science 

SUN ENERGY 

In the spriiifrtinie all vegetation awakens to renewed life. This 
transformation would be most astonishing if its annual recurrence 
had not taught us to accept it as a matter of course. The advent of 
the growing season which comes with unfailing regularity, is the 
result of more sun energy', that is, more light, and with it, more heat 
rays which we can feel yet can not see, and more, also, of that mys- 
terious radiation which we can neither feel nor see, but which we 
now know to be a potent agency affecting ail living creatures, namely 
the ultra-violet rays. 

Our house plants have the habit of growing toward the sun, and 
we ourselves intuitively seek its light and warming rays. No physi- 
cian need order us to do it; it is simply natural that we crave sun- 
shine. Under its influence we are alert, active, optimistic, cheerful. 
When great lowering clouds hide the sun from us, we are apathetic, 
lethargic, and gloomy. "Diogenes," asked Alexander the Great, 
"what can I do for you?" "AMiat boon would you beg of the all- 
powerful conqueror of nations?" "Step aside, Alexander," answered 
the old philosopher, who was not noted for tact or courtesy. "Step 
aside, and do not shut out my sunlight." 

WINDOWS OF GLASS AFFECTING HEALTH 

Primitive man was at one time a cave dweller. His house was 
dark. There were no windows. But the chances are that he was at 
home but little, that he lived largely in the open, and that only when 
the weather was extremely inclement did he take refuge in the dark 
hole in the rock which he called home. It is highly probable also 
that when the season permitted it, his apparel was not more extensive 
than a modern sun suit. We may be sure that he got his ultra-violet 
pretty generously, as did also his spouse and children. Unquestion- 
ably man is an out-of-door creature intended to live in the sunlight.

192 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

And for thousands of years he so lived. But a few centuries ago a 
marvelous transparent substance was discovered, namely glass, and 
this discovery has in a marked degree changed the human habits of 
life and of work, for the cold months are now spent largely indoors, 
behind this glass, which shuts out the wintry winds, but transmits 
sunlight, and with it some of the warmth of winter sunshine. Un- 
fortunately, however, and this was unknown until quite recently, 
glass does not transmit all the kinds of sun energy which we need, 
for the rays of shorter wave lengths than those of light are in large 
measure intercepted by glass and so these rays now fail to reach us. 
Thus we receive in our homes, and even on our sun porch, a vitiated 
and abnormal sun radiation — a radiation which has lost something, 
something imperceptible to our organs of vision, but which we re- 
quire for our physical well-being. 

EFFECTS OF SUN ACTIVITY 

The sun is about 93,000,000 miles distant. Its enormous mass ex- 
hibits tremen<Jous chemical activity, and it is radiating its sub- 
stance — so scientists inform us — at the rate of several million tons 
per second. The sun radiation thus engendered streams into space 
and only a relatively small per cent of it reaches the planet on which 
we live. Yet, as this small portion of the total varies, we experience 
winter or summer, great heat or extreme cold ; our vegetation flour- 
ishes or dies ; our hills are green, or they are white with a covering 
of water crystals from the skies ; our continent experiences a glacial 
period, or an age of tropical warmth. 

The sun radiation vaporizes the waters on the earth and forms 
clouds, fog and rain. It stirs up the atmospheric mantle which sur- 
rounds our planet and causes winds to blow — gentle spring zephyrs, 
or devastating tornadoes. It develops the green and the yellow pig- 
ments in leaves and the riot of colors in flowers. It also makes the 
vegetable cell function as a chemical laboratory in which water and 
the carbon dioxide of the air form plant substance, and thus our 
plants grow, producing our food, our shelter, and our raiment. Even 
our fuels, gas, coal, and oil, have a sun-energy origin, and the modern 
cliff dweller in his steam-heated apartment, reading his newspaper 
under the incandescent Madza, gets light which originated in the 
sun, no matter whether the electric current he uses is generated from 
coal or by water power. We are warmed by the sun, fed by the sun, 
and clothed b}^ it, just as was primitive man, ages before us. 

WHAT IS SUN ENERGY? 

Now what is it that the sun sends to us through 93,000,000 miles 
of space? Is it a stream of electrons? So it would appear. But 



MODERN SUN CULT — STURMER 193 

we had better not be clo<;in:itio on this subject which is linked with 
the finuhiinental conc'ei)ts of eneiiry and matter — concepts wliich have 
been niodilied quite recently, and may soon be njodified still further. 
Most physicists now subscribe to the corpuscular theory, in accord- 
ance with which lii;ht, and the ultra-violet and the heat rays as well, 
come from the sun as a stream of corpuscles, emitted in a succession 
of bursts, but the latter so close tojjether, and following one upon 
the other with such inconceivable speed, that the stream is, as far 
as we can perceive, continuous and unbroken. 

WAVE LENGTHS 

When, however, solar radiations are to l)e dealt with in their prac- 
tical aspects, as for instance in i-eixanl to reflection or refraction, it 
is the other theory of li^ht, the wave theory, that provides the 
nomenclature. So we continue to speak of wave lengths, and of wave 
frequencies, just as we do in radio parlance. Indeed, it is generally 
accepted that certain light waves may be " tuned in," and other light 
waves refused entry. On this basis we explain the phenomenon of 
color. But to understand the exi)laiiation we must remember that 
the light waves of the dilTerent colors of the spectrum differ in 
length; that the red waves are the longest, and that the waves become 
shorter and shorter, through the orange, yellow, green, blue, and 
violet, the latter being less than half the length of the red. 

ULTRA-VIOLET 

It must not be assumed that ultra-violet rays are of a single wave 
length. On the contrary, they embody a range of wave lengths, just 
as light rays represent a range. The longest waves of ultra-violet 
are just a little shorter than the shortest violet waves. They are thus 
just beyond the violet rays of the spectrum. Hence the term ultra- 
violet. It is not quite correct, however, to speak of ultra-violet light, 
for light is visible, while the rays of shorter wave lengths than those 
of light are invisible. Hence we had better use the term ultra-violet 
radiation. 

THE Angstrom unit 

We must bear in mind that the waves of light rays are exceedingly 
mimite — too short to be measured by ordinary methods, and that we 
can not conveniently express such infinitesimal lengths in fractions 
of inches or even of millimeters. And as the waves of ultra-violet 
rays are shorter still, the necessit}' for a special unit of length to be 
employed in the measurement of such minute waves is obvious. 

Tiie unit most generally used is called the Angstrom unit, and was 
so named in honor of a Swedish physicist by the name of Angstrom. 



194 



ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 



It is a metric unit, and represents iooo^ooo tt of a millimeter, the 
millimeter being equivalent to about -^ of an inch. Now in terms of 
this unit visible light ranges from about 3,600 Angstrom units (A), 
to about 7,700 A — although it must be remembered that the human 
organs of vision vary in their range, and that many persons can not 
see the raj'^s of wave lengths as short as 3,600 A, nor those of wave 
lengths as long as 7,700 A.

WAVE LENGTHS OF ULTRA-A^OLET 

Wave lengths shorter than 3,600 A, and down to about 1,000 A, 
constitute the ultra-violet radiation. The shorter the waves, the 
higher the frequency, that is, the larger is the number which pass a 
given point in a unit of time. All solar radiation travels at the same 
inconceivable speed of about 186,500 miles a second, thus being capa- 
ble of encircling the earth more than seven times in that short period. 
This applies to ultra-violet as well as to visible light, just as it does 
also to the very long waves which carry our radio programs. This 
means that the rays from ultra-violet lamps reach us so speedily — 
if they are not absorbed by an intervening medium — that we have no 
time to side-step them, even though we may stand at some distance 
from the lamp. We can protect ourselves only by the use of an in- 
tercepting medium. 

The radio waves, many city blocks in length, the infra-red, visi- 
ble light, ultra-violet, and X rays, all seem to be fundamentally the 
same, except in the matter of wave lengths and conversely in the 
rapidity with which the waves follow one upon the other; but by 



MODERN SUN CULT — STURMER 195 

virtue of this variation they exliibit a most decided diflference in 
penetrability and in their action on inanimate objects and on living 
organisms. 

SOURCE OF ULTRA-VIOLET 

An ordinal"}' wood or coul fire emits lipht and heat rays, but no 
appreciable ultra-violet radiation. If, however, carbon disulphide 
is burned in a stream of oxygen, the flame which exhibits intense 
white light, emits also ultra-violet radiation. So ordinary combus- 
tion can be the source of these mysterious rays. But carbon disul- 
phide is a substance both dangerous and malodorous, and its use in 
lamps for the production of ultra-violet is limited to laboratory 
experiments. 

ULTRA-VIOLET LAMPS 

The practical ultra-violet lamps are types of electric lamps. This 
applies to those which are used for strictly scientific purposes as well 
as to the lamps now so largely sold for family use for the irradiation 
of the human body. To be sure, the lamps for scientific purposes are 
designed to furnish a greater intensity of radiation, and one embody- 
ing a wider range of wave lengths. They are also provided with 
filters to intercept the light waves, which is not a necessity if the 
lamp is to be employed for therapeutic purposes, as for such uses 
the accompanying light waves seem to be desirable and certainly 
not objectionable. 

Structurally the lamps may be divided into two classes: The ex- 
posed arc ligiits, and the lamps in which the radiation is produced 
within a bulb or tube. The principle upon which the majority of 
ultra-violet lamps are constructed is that an electric spark sent 
through the vapor of certain metals — iron, nickel, zinc, mercury, 
etc. — produces this radiation. 

A common form of the arc type has carbon electrodes with metal- 
lic cores, or cores impregnated with metallic ingredients. But also 
carbons without metallic ingredients may be used, in which case 
a very wide arc (abtjut 2 inches) is employed. 

The other kind of lamp (always with a bulb or tube) is known as 
a mercury vapor lamp. Such a lamp may have electrodes of mercury, 
or these may be of some other metal, such as tungsten; but in either 
case the gap between the electrodes is occupied by mercury vapor 
which the current traverses and causes to glow with a greenish light, 
the invisible ultra-violet rays being produced with the light waves. 
The light from such a lamp does not include the longest vi.sible waves, 
that is, it is devoid of the red and orange; and as a consequence the 
light is colored, for white is obtained when all the wave-lengths of 
the red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet are produced. The 



196 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN" INSTITUTION, 19 3 

lamps used for therapeutic purposes may be arc lamps or mercury 
vapor lamps, but for scientific use the latter type of lamp is usually 
preferred. 

A common- form of mercury vapor lamp is essentially a specially 
constructed quartz tube, exhausted of air, and containing liquid mer- 
cury wliich may be made to separate, and thus an arc may be struck. 
The wires are connected in such a manner that the spark must jump 
from the one body of mercury to the other, thus traversing the gap 
occupied by mercury vapor. 

Quartz is employed for the tube or bulb because of its remarkable 
transparency to ultra-violet rays, permitting penetration of wave 
lengths as short as about 1,850 A. Only calcite and fluorspar are 
known to transmit yet shorter wave lengths. For the lamps designed 
for therapeutic use, quartz need not be employed, as such lamps are 
planned to furnish only the ultra-violet rays of wave lengths greater 
than 2,900 A, these being the rays which come to us in sunshine. 
Thus a special kind of glass may be made to serve for the tube or 
bulbs, and the employment of quartz is not necessary for family sun 
lamps. Lamps embodying bulbs or tubes are known to become less 
efficient with use. This progressive loss of efficiency is largely due 
to changes which the radiation effects in the quartz or glass, prob- 
ably a gradual devitrification, and a discoloration because of the 
deposition of particles by sublimation. 

FILTERING OUT LIGHT WAVES 

The filters used to cut out the light waves, so that only the ultra- 
violet may be transmitted, are either plates of quartz on which a 
thin film of silver has been deposited, or they are glasses deeply col- 
ored with certain metallic ingredients. 

THE INVISIBLE BECOMES VISIBLE 

When the invisible ultra-violet rays, unaccompanied by light rays, 
are caused to fall upon certain objects, an astonishing phenomenon 
may be observed. Objects which in common light have color, may 
change color; and objects which are commonly colorless, may ex- 
hibit color — may show red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or violet — 
any color of the spectrum. Thus, the fingernails, the teeth, and 
the eyeballs glow with a pale yellow light. A crystal of calcite 
looks like a coal of fire ; a crystal of fluorite shows a beautiful violet 
blue. The zinc ore called Willemite, glows brilliantly with a yellow- 
green light. Indeed, man}^ chemicals, in ultra-violet light, show 
characteristic color effects. Thus, calomel exhibits a brick-red 
color, sodium salicylate is violet blue; quinine, violet; petrolatum, 



MODERN SUN CULT STURMER 197 

light blue. Tlie explanation of such extraordinary ellccts is that 
these substances, and many others which show color under ultra- 
violet have the property of reducing the latter radiation to longer 
wave lengths ellecting a step-down, as we might call it, and thus 
bringing the rays within the range of the visible spectrum. 

FLUORESCENCE 

This phenomenon is called lluorescence, because it was observed 
first in the mineral fluorite. 

Not only tiie color, but also the intensity of the fluorescence, varies 
greatly. Thus, for example, both sodium and potassium salicylate 
show a violet-blue; but tlie fluorescence of the sodium salt is much 
more pronounced. Again some solids which show little or no 
fluorescence, may develop it to a marked degree when they are dis- 
solved in an appropriate solvent. The examination of substances 
under ultra-violet is a new development in science, and one which 
gives })romise of many applications in solving problems in practical 
chemistry. 

Certain substances fluoresce with a red light, that is to say, they 
step down the invisible rays to about 7,000 A. If the waves coming 
from the chemical when it is subjected to ultra-violet are mostly 
waves of about 5,500 A, these will appear to our eyes as green ; and 
so on through the range of colors which are seen in the rainbow. 
But we must remember that just as visible light represents not a 
single wave length but a range from about 7,700 A to about 3,G00 A, 
so does ultra-violet radiation represent a range of wave lengths, 
beginning where the shortest waves of the visible spectrum end, at 
about 3,G00 A, and diminishing in length to about 1,000 A. Im- 
mediately beyond the ultra-violet there lies an unexplored field; and 
then, farther on, in the neighborhood of 100 A there are the X rays 
concerning which we have some definite knowledge. And, lastly, 
beyond the X rays, come the shortest waves known to science, the 
gamma vays. from radium, and beyond these tlie cosmic rays about 
which we now are receiving rather startling information. 

ABSORPTION OF ULTRA-VIOLET 

We are all familiar with the fact that some substances, like soot, 
absorb all the rays of common light, and hence appear black, while 
other substances reflect indiscriminately all the wave lengths of 
light, as does this paper, and hence appear white. We know also 
that many substances exhibit selective absorption, failing to appro- 
priate the red, the yellow, the green, or the blue, and tlius possess 
the colors of the wave lengths which are not absorbed. 
28095—31 14 



198 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

Now ultra-violet, speaking generally, is much less penetrating 
than the longer waves which we can see, and this feeble penetrability 
diminishes more and more as the wave decreases in length. The 
opacity of most known substances to the ultra-violet radiation has 
tended to make its study difficult, and it was not until the technique 
of making quartz glass had been perfected that much headway could 
be made. But in fused quartz we have a medium transparent to 
waves as short as 1,850 A. For the study of still shorter waves cer- 
tain minerals, namely fiuorite and calcite, are employed. But the 
waves shorter than 1,850 A have at present no practical application, 
so the quartz glass serves very acceptably. 

THE WAVE LENGTHS WHICH PASS THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE 

Solar radiation is rich in ultra-violet. Just how rich, and what 
its range of wave lengths may be, we do not know, perhaps shall 
never know, for our atmosphere, even when it is clear, cuts out all the 
wave lengths shorter than those of about 2,900 A. What is known 
concerning the shorter waves has been learned through the study of 
radiation artificially supplied by arc lights and lights from sparks 
through metallic vapors. 

ULTRA-VIOLET THROUGH GLASS 

Common glass transmits only the longest waves of ultra-violet 
radiation, those which are longer than about 3,400 A, and hence are 
in the neighborhood of the visible violet light waves. This explains 
why a sunporch furnishes impoverished sunlight. But in recent 
years special kinds of glass have been made, designed to transmit 
the solar ultra-violet more generously. The claim is made that this 
glass transmits about 65 per cent of the invisible active rays, a 
statement which requires explanation. The facts are these: Not 65 
per cent of all the ultra-violet waves of sunshine pass through in 
the same proportion in which they occur out of doors, but rather 65 
per cent of the radiation, with a much greater absorption of the 
shorter waves — even a total absorption of some of them — and a 
lesser interception of the longer ones. In other words, these so- 
called ultra-violet transmitting media do cut out an appreciable 
amount of the wave lengths shorter than about 3,000 A. 

THE DORNO REGION 

The significance of the interception of wave lengths shorter than 
about 3,000 A by the special glasses, and of all wave lengths below 
3,300 or 3,400 A by common glass is better understood when it is 
known that the rays which produce the beneficial effects on the 



MODERN SUN CULT STURMER 199 

human skin connected with the production of vitnmin D are those 
of wave lentj^ths from 2,900 A to 3,130 A. This region of the ultra- 
violet rano^e of wave lenti^ths is known as the Dorno region, and 
embodies the rays used therapeutically. These are the rays which 
are desired chiefly filso in the radiation from the ultra-violet lamp. 
Rays of wave lengths from 2.S00 A to 3,300 A are known to produce 
pigment, but particularly is this effect said to be due to the wave 
lengths of the Dorno region. It appears that tanning is nature's 
protection against too much ultra-violet radiation of the wave 
lengths which cause the chemical changes in the skin, for when the 
(an has become deep enough, the Dorno rays no longer penetrate, 
but are absorbed by the pigment and changed to heat rays. 

WINDOWS 

Window panes of quartz glass, SiO., give, of course, the best results 
in the transmission of the ultra-violet of the Dorno region; but only 
quite recently has the manufacture of quartz window panes been 
j)laced on an industrial basis, and unfortunately the price is still 
too high to admit of their general employment in the windows of 
solaria. The other types of ultra-violet transmitting glass, though 
not as satisfactory, are much cheaper. A still cheaper substitute is 
celophane, which is essentially a transparent product of cellulose. 
This substance transmits the radiation quite well, hut it lacks dura- 
bility, and requires a specially constructed frame. 

DOSAGE OF SUNSHINE 

How much sunshine do we need? Sunshine, like heat, food, or 
medicine, or any other agency which affects us, must be taken in 
proper apportionment. There is such a thing as too much food. 
Certainly, such a thing as too much calomel. That too much heat 
hurts us, we learn in early childhood. Sooner or later we learn also 
that too much sunshine is harmful. And an extensive and deep 
sunburn is not only painful, but like any other burn, is dangerous, 
resulting in cell destruction, with the generation of toxins, which 
cause systemic poisoning. Thus even sunshine must be taken in 
proper dosage. Fortunately, however, sunshine does not ordinarily 
harm us if we accustom ourselves to it gradually, and thus avoid 
sunburn. This remark, however, applies only to persons who are 
well, for in certain diseases even strong sunshine may be detrimental. 

PROTECTION AGAINST ULTRA-VIOLET 

If we are interested in protection against ultra-violet rather than 
in its transmission, we need but remember that substances which 
allow only the longer waves of the visible spectrum to pass — amber 



200 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

glass, red glass, orange, and yellow glass — will prove opaque to 
ultra-violet, while a medium which cuts out the red end of the 
spectrum and transmits the violet and blue will prove to be rather 
transparent also to the adjacent invisible waves just beyond the 
violet. Thus blue cobalt glass transmits some ultra-violet, while 
red glass and amber glass filter it out, together with the short-wave 
radiation of the visible spectrum, namely, the violet, blue, and green. 

It will be seen, in the light of this fact, that the practice, formerly 
in vogue, of keeping the light-sensitive chemicals in blue glass 
bottles was a misguided procedure, destined to prove ineffectual, 
while our present-day practice of employing amber glass is founded 
on sound principles and is much more effective. 

Another means employed to shut out ultra-violet is to interpose 
a fluorescent substance as a protective, for such a substance will 
transform this radiation into visible light waves. The cold creams 
and ointments specially devised to protect against sunburn are com- 
pounded on this principle and contain fluorescent material. Even 
the ointment bases are fluorescent. 

That sunlight deleteriously affects house paint is well known, and 
we have all observed how much longer paint lasts on the north 
side than it does on the southward exposure. The inclusion of a 
fluorescent material is, therefore, of benefit in house paint. Now 
zinc white is such a substance, and its employment in the paint 
materially lowers the penetration of the ultra-violet rays which 
are so destructive to the linseed-oil binder, causing the oxidized oil 
to disintegrate to powder, thus bringing about the result which 
the painter refers to as " chalking." Most face paint, also, is 
somewhat fluorescent, and is to some degree a protection against 
sunburn. 

CLOTHING AND ULTRA-VIOLET 

A few remarks about clothing may be relevant in this discussion. 
A person exposed to the ultra-violet in connection with electric 
welding may receive a burn through his clothing. This is due to 
the intensity of the radiation. But most clothing effectively inter- 
cepts the light rays and also the ultra-violet radiation of sunlight. 
Animal hair is quite opaque to solar ultra-violet. Only very white 
hair transmits it to a slight extent. This means that all woolen 
clothing is an effective ultra-violet filter, and that the modern male 
promenading on the boardwalk receives practically no such radia- 
tion through his clothing. Silk also is fairly opaque, linen a trifle 
less so, whole cotton is a bit more transparent. The most trans- 
parent textile is a loosely-woven rayon or artificial silk, which 
explains why the sex known during the Victorian era as the 
weaker sex is on the way to becoming the robust sex. The girls 



MODERN SUN CULT — STURMER 201 

are getting more solar radiation, hence more vitamin D. This in 
part exphiins it. I woiikl not be guilty of a breach in tact and 
criticize feminine raiment, which by the way would be futile, for 1 
know that in the past neither the facts disclosed by science nor 
the ailmonitions of the medical profession have had any influence 
on the fashions of dress. Hence it is probably fortunate that I 
have warrant for the statement that the feminine dress of to-day is 
in far closer harmony with the newer facts pertaining to irradiatuMi 
as a health measure than is the modern attire of the male. "\\'omen 
have gone far, since Civil Wai- days, in so changing the fashions 
as to provide for plenty of sun irradiation; and in this span of time 
the men, alas, have made progress merely to the extent of having 
shaved off their whiskers and exposing their chins to the sun. 
Only on the bench at the seashore does the pii)e-smoking sex get 
an even break when it comes to solar radiation. What should be 
done about this is a matter far beyond the scope of this discussion. 
AVe give it up. 

SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SUNBURN 

The human skin varies considerably in its tolerance of solar radia- 
tion. Light-skinned persons are more sensitive to it than are the 
dark skinned, and in most individuals a tolerance may be slowly de- 
veloped by progressively increasing doses — if one may use the term 
doses in this connection. Speaking generally, our arms can stand 
about half again as much as the chest, abdomen, or back; the legs 
a little more than the arms, the backs of our hands about 5 times as 
much, and the palms about 15 times as much, while the foot soles are 
most resistive, because here the skin is thickest, and the outer skin 
is a poor conductor of radiation. But persons who do not tan must 
be very careful in taking sun baths. 

BURNS BY REFLECTED RAYS 

A sunburn, unlike a heat burn, does not become manifest instantly. 
We may receive an overdose of sun radiation and remain oblivious 
of the fact for three or four hours. Nor is it easy to judge how long 
we may with impunity subject ourselves to sunshine at any given 
time, for so much depends upon the time of day, the season of the 
year, and the atmospheric conditions. We should know, however, 
that not only the direct rays burn, but that diffused sunlight, and 
reflected radiation, does also; that, for example, we may sit in a boat 
under an awning and receive a burn. It should be borne in mind 
that much of our ultra-violet comes to us reflected from the sky, and 
that the north exposure of our house provides about half as much 
as the exposure facing the sun. 



202 Al^^NUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 

VARYING INTENSITY OF SUNLIGHT 

It may, further, help us to guard against sunburn if we remember 
the fundamental fact that the lower strata of our atmosphere are 
particularly absorptive toward ultra-violet, much more so than the 
more rarified strata higher up, the curve of ultra-violet in sunshine 
being virtually identical with the arc described by the sun in its 
course from horizon to horizon, which explains why old Sol is so 
much more powerful near the middle of the day, and much feebler 
when in the morning and evening its rays travel a longer distance 
through denser strata. It is indeed a common observation that at 
sunrise and at sunset even the violet and blue of the visible spectrum 
is largely cut out, giving us a preponderance of reddish and orange 
light. And as a matter of fact, the ultra-violet is almost wholly in- 
tercepted at the same time. 

WINTER SUNSHINE 

In the winter, the sun is not so high in the sky, and its slanting 
rays are for this reason relatively poor in ultra-violet, just as are 
those of the morning and evening sun. Furthermore, there may be 
fog, clouds, and soot particles, all of which filter out the shorter rays. 
Soot is the greatest offender in this respect, and does much to deplete 
still further the enfeebled sunshine of the cold season of the year. 
Our industrial centers naturally suffer most in the matter of vitiated 
sunlight, for in order that we may keep warm, and that our wheels 
of industry may be kept spinning, immense quantities of soot are 
belched forth from our chimneys. 

DEFICIENCY OF ULTRA-VIOLET 

In other words, we are systematically sacrificing the short-wave 
solar ultra-violet in order that we may have an abundance of the 
longer waves which keep us warm. Only in very recent years have 
we learned about the unhealthfulness of this practice, and have 
come to; the conviction that something must be done about it. A 
paucity of solar radiation means, so medical men tell us, a slackened 
metabolism, an enfeebled condition, a lowered resistance to germ 
diseases. It has in fact been suggested that the gradual extinction 
of certain Indian tribes may be due largely to their altered dress, 
and their changed modes of life, resulting in inadequate sun irradia- 
tion, which is so necessary to them. In children, regardless of race, 
too little sunlight may mean rickets, or tuberculosis; and it was in- 
deed in the treatment of these diseases that solar radiation was first 
employed in a systematic way. The sun cure is not, however, in 
reality modern, for Antyllus, a physician of ancient Rome, made use 



MODERN SUN CULT STUBMER 203 

of it, and he practiced heliotherapy lonf]: befoi'e anything was i<no\vn 
about vitamin D. It is interesting to know also that rickets is the 
disease which he treated with sunlight. But since his day much 
definite information has been brought to liglit, some of it by feeding 
experiments conducted with animals, both in the absence and in the 
presence of radiation. Curative procedures also have been engaged 
in, experimentally on animals, and clinically on patients in hospitals. 

VITAMIN D 

It is now known that when the skin is irradiated with ultra- 
violet, pigmentation or tanning is not the only result. Far more 
important is the change experienced by a certain chemical substance 
in the skin, a substance which becomes activated to form a vitamin, 
namely, the vitamin now designated as vitamin D, which appears 
to be just as essential to the proper functioning of the human organ- 
ism as is certain mineral matter which, it is well known, we must 
supply in our diet. If, then, we receive, because of our abnormal 
modern conditions of life, too little sun radiation, the tiny labora- 
tories in our skin fail to elaborate an adequate supply of vitamin D, 
and as a result, the life functions fail to go on normally and as they 
should, even though we may not develop a recognizable disease. 

BOTTLED SUNSHINE 

We may in such cases proceed in a manner suggested by the serum 
treatments. We may obtain from another living organism the sub- 
stance which we fail to produce ourselves. If we cannot develop our 
own vitamin D, we may buy it, and take it as medicine or food. Now 
the codfisli, and other fish also, possess an abundance of vitamin D, 
the source of which appears to be the marine algae, which are eaten 
by shrimp and small fish, which in turn supply the vitamin much 
against tiieir will to the larger fish. The vitamin D in fish is found 
principally in the liver, and it occurs in the oil expressed from fish 
liver. So cod-liver oil has come to be known as '' bottled sunshine " 
useful in the treatment of the diseases which develop because of an 
inadequacy of solar radiation. 

HOW MUCH SUNSHINE IS ENOUGH 

But what amount of such radiation and how much ultra-violet 
is adequate? We do not know. Physicians recognize the diseased 
conditions which follow a dearth of sunlight but they cannot tell 
us precisely how much we must have. Hence we do not know how 
long we must be in the sunlight, how great an area of our body 
surface must be exposed to it, nor how long we can go on without 
irradiation. But we do know that in the winter at least we do not 
receive as much as we need. 



204 ANNUAXi REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

SUNLIGHT CAN NOT BE STANDARDIZED 

As the ultra-violet rays in sunlight vary, not only according to the 
season and the time of day, but also according to atmospheric condi- 
tions it is utterly impossible to determine with any degree of accuracy 
the dosage of sunlight needed in specific cases. Hence the helio- 
therapist has learned to proceed cautiously and experimentally. A 
sun bath of an hour may be safe enough on a certain day, but may, 
at the same hour, and in the same length of time, on the day follow- 
ing, cause a severe sunburn. One can not standardize sunlight with 
precision. In this respect, certainly, the ultra-violet lamp offers 
an advantage. For with the same apparatus, and with the distance 
from the lamp also the same, the time of irradiation practically 
determines the dosage. This dosage is now being worked out, al- 
though, of course, we must remember that some persons are much 
more susceptible than others to the radiation, just as individuals 
differ in their tolerance of our common drugs. 

IRRADIATED FOODS 

The substance in the skin which responds to the ultra-violet is asso- 
ciated with cholesterol, and a similar substance is found in certain 
plants associated with phytosterol, which suggested that probably 
the vitamin could be produced in certain foods by irradiation, thus 
making unnecessary the ingestion of the unpalatable cod-liver oil. 
Irradiated grain foods, irradiated milk and similar products have 
given promise of usefulness. Such irradiated foods are now on the 
market, as are also concentrated products obtained by treating an 
impure ergosterol with ultra-violet rays. The dose of the latter 
product is extremely small, and an overdose is harmful. It is said 
to represent 100,000 times its weight of cod-liver oil as far as the 
antirachitic effect is concerned. Strange to say, however, when ergo- 
sterol, or a food containing it, is irradiated too long, the vitamin 
becomes inactive. Indeed, the whole study of irradiated foods, and 
of cod-liver oil substitutes generally, is still in its infancy, and much 
remains to be learned, if not in regard to the technique of their prepa- 
ration, then certainly as regards proper dosage. A preparation of 
irradiated ergosterol has been approved by the council of pharmacy 
and chemistry of the American Medical Association, and may be ac- 
cepted as quite reliable. But such products should be considered as 
medicine, to be taken under medical supervision. 

USE OF LAMPS 

The same cautious course should be followed also in the employ- 
ment of ultra-violet radiation when this is produced artificially. We 
know that sunlight does not ordinarily harm us if we avoid sunburn. 
But the radiation from arc lights or mercury vapor lamps embodies 
the wave lentrths shorted than those found in sunlight which comes 



MODERN SUN CULT — STURMER 205 

to US filtered by the atmosphere. It is also more intense. For these 
reasons the radiation artificially produced is far more dangerous. 
But unquestionably, tiie contrivances to furnish ultra-violet and thus 
to compensate for our loss of normal sunshine, are, if used properly, 
of proat value. It is not wise, however, to proceed to self-treatment 
without expert direction. Here also conservatism is the part of wis- 
dom. Let those who have been specially trained, do the pioneering. 

THE ZONES OF ULTRA-VIOLET RAYS 

The radiation from a mercury vapor lamp produces violet, blue, 
•rreen, and yellow li^ht waves, which can be filtered out; and also 
ultra-violet rays from the violet down to a wave length of about 1,850 
to 1,870 A. Waves shorter than 1.850 A are cut out by quartz and are 
never found in the radiation from a mercury vapor lamp. The waves 
of the Dorno region, 2,900 to 3,130 A, and the longer ones, have the 
action of sunlight, but are of course supplied in greater abiuidance. 
Like sunlight they stimulate metabolism, govern our calcium balance, 
increase the alkalinity and the iron content of the blood, sharpen the 
appetite, and may be used in the treatment of rickets, certain skin 
diseases, and of tuberculosis. Such skin irradiation produces a slight 
rise in the temperature, which soon falls to normal. It does not af- 
fect the blood pressure. If prolonged, it can, of course, cause sun- 
burn, and it may cause inflammation of the eyes, this being due mainly 
to the waves shorter than about 3,050 A. 

Waves shorter than 3,000 A are correspondingly more irritating 
and more dangerous to the eyes. Since these shorter waves are pro- 
duced in the operation of electric welding, they are frequently en- 
countered, and their dangerous nature should be kept in mind. 
Goggles of special glass designed to intercept them, are worn by the 
persons engaged in such operations; the spectators, however, are not 
so protected, and must look out for themselves. 

BACTERICIDAL RAYS 

The waves shorter than 3,000 A and longer than 2,000 A are de- 
cidedly bactericidal, particularly those between 2,490 A to 2,380 A. 
But longer wave-lengths also have a killing effect on some germs, 
though in a much lesser degree. Indeed, this is true in a measure in 
regard to the violet, the blue, and the green of the visible spectrum. 
Speaking generally, the longer the wave lengths, above 3,000 A, the 
less effective are the rays in the destruction of bacteria. 

CHEMICAL ACTION 

Waves shorter than 3,000 A also convert oxygen into ozone, hence 

this substance is always in evidence when an ultra-violet lamp is in 

operation. Ozone is a very active oxidizing agent, and in dilution 

acts on us as a stimulant. It is interesting in this connection to note 



206 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

that the solar radiation forms ozone in the upper regions of the at- 
mosphere, and that when the sky is clear, and when the wind is 
from the west or the southwest, some of the ozone is found at the 
earth's surface, thus augmenting the exhilarating effect of the out- 
door air, when we are taking a stroll under such weather conditions. 
It may explain also why we are apt to feel less energetic when the 
wind is from the east, for then the ozone is absent. Old-fashioned 
fishermen may even contend that it provides justification for their 
deep convictions to the effect that " When the wind is from the east, 
the fishing is the least." But no one gives credence to what fisher- 
men say. 

A NEW TOOL FOR THE CHEMIST 

To the chemist the ultra-violet lamp has opened up new methods 
of identification. Since so many substances exhibit characteristic

In the paint industry it may be employed to study the resistance to 
sunlight of various paints and varnish mixtures. Its applications 
for the chemist seem indeed almost endless. It is a tool of great 
value to the analyst as well as to the physician. But it must, of 
course, be handled with caution. Such a lamp is not a plaything. 

ANCIENT AND MODERN SUN WORSHIP 

Man has since time immemorial recognized sunlight as a natural 
agency of paramount influence. Many primitive races worship the 
sun as a deity, a practice at one time quite general and extending 
over long periods of time. Our American Indians still conduct 
their sun dances. The ancient sun worship, not only in Africa and 
in Asia, but also in Europe, and on this continent, had its gruesome 
aspects for it entailed, frequently, human sacrifice — sacrifice to the 
sun god. The modern sun cult, should, however, exhibit no such in- 
human features. Only ignorance, leading to the reckless misuse of 
sun therapy, can call for victims. Let us hope, therefore, that this 
new health-giving agency may be employed wisely and conserva- 
tively by the enthusiastic devotees of the modern sun cult and that 
experimentation in this field may be limited to persons who have 
the necessary knowledge and skill. 



THE MOON AND RADIOACTIVITY ' 



By V. S. FoRims 
Chriat't College, Cambridge 



In a study of the surface features of our satellite one is immedi- 
ately impressed by the remarkable sharpness and freshness which 
many of those features exhibit. Further, one is struck by the fact 
that evidences of compressive action are in the minority, whereas 
the moon's crust shows clearly innumerable clefts, rifts, and frac- 
tures pointing to an extensional tendency beneath its outer envelope. 
This is hardly in accordance wilh our ideas of the appearance of a 
sphere which has lost all its heat; everywhere it should show signs 
of intense contraction, and arcuate mountain ranges should be more 
frequent than upon the face of the earth. 

It is now generally accepted that the moon must have cooled to 
something like its present condition long before the earth came to 
the state in which its igneously fluid mass was crusted over. Ac- 
cording to Dr. R. H. Rastall ^ the moon is very probably the missing 
two-thirds of the earth's sialsphere, which in the liquid state was 
stripjjed off by some form of tidal resonance. A certain amount 
of sima was stripped off at the same time, giving the moon its 
density of 3.46. (Density of sial, about 2.7.) Support is lent to 
this view by the recent investigations made by Dr. F. E. Wright ' 
on the optical course of the moon's radiation. He states that " re- 
sults clearly indicate that at the surface of the moon, no dark rocks, 
low in silica, nor iron, nor obsidians are exposed in appreciable 
amounts; but light-colored rocks high in silica and powders of trans- 
parent substances are possible." In other words, the moon's surface 
is predominantly of sial. 

Now it seems highly improbable that the many well-preserved 
surface features of the moon could have been formed at that remote 
period before the earth had obtained a solid crust. It is true that the

ordinary agents of erosion and degradation are absent on the moon, 
but there still remain two destructive forces to be reckoned with; 
forces which should surely have obliterated or dulled the trace of 
finer markings in the immense period of time at their disposal. The 
first of these is differential expansion and contraction in the rocks, 
aided by gravity, and rendered far more potent than on the earth by 
the tremendous temperature range and the abruptness of thermal 
changes exjjerienced on the atmosphereless moon. This force should 
operate to cause exfoliation and crumbling of every exposed rock 
surface, causing a slow but inevitable degradation of relief. The 
rock screes would creep downwards through expansion and contrac- 
tion. The absence of water and organic matter would prevent cemen- 
tation of the talus, and movement would continue until a low angle 
was reached. It should be noted that the smaller gravity value on the 
moon is offset by the fact that this reduces friction, so the capacity of 
loose material for downward motion is not thereby affected. - 

The fact that this temperature change now occurs but once in 
every 14 days does not diminish the value of this argument. For if 
the moon's features were formed before the earth's crust had cooled, 
these features were then more often exposed to the temperature 
changes, owing to the moon's then greater rapidity of rotation and 
revolution. Subjection to this temperature range, even if only once 
every 14 days throughout the immense period which has elapsed 
since pre- Archeozoic times, must surely have operated to degrade all 
the moon's features in a marked degree. 

If during a brief period the moon possessed an atmosphere, the 
ordinary agents of erosion and denudation were then present to 
destroy the relief rapidly. Formation of the major part of the 
original surface features necessarily preceded the loss of the atmos- 
phere, since as long as volcanic action occurred, gases would be 
emitted to compensate wholly or partly for the diffusion of the 
atmosphere into space. It is indeed surprising that evidences of this 
period of active degradation as well as the subsequent and exceedingly 
long period of slow degradation, are so conspicuously absent in many 
of the moon's surface features. If, on the other hand, the original 
surface features were not of volcanic formation, as assumed above, 
an explanation must be sought for a phase of violent vulcanicity at 
a later stage in its history. 

The second destructional force likely to obliterate the moon's sharp 
relief is the continuous bombardment of meteors and meteorites to 
which it is no doubt subjected. The moon being destitute of any 
protective gaseous envelope, all meteorites and meteors entering its 
gravitative field will come into contact with its surface. The impact 



MOON AND RADIOACTIVITY — FORBES 209 

of these bodies will l)v tlieir shock, aiul also by hittiiijj: screes directly, 
greatly accelerate the downward luotion of rock i)articles. 

Again, the moon exhibits on its surface a color-range between the 
dark lavas of the " seas " or maria and the dazzling white ray systems 
which surround the largest craters or vulcauoids. One can not be- 
lieve that this gradation in coloring could have persisted since the 
moon's formation, under an incessant hail of meteors. For if a 
meteor's force of impact be suflicient, its constituents will be imme- 
diately volatilized by the resultant heat.* The meteoric material 
will thus be scattered, but will settle down uj:)on the crust. In time 
tiie whole surface of the satellite will be covered by a homogeneous 
layer of meteoric dust which will give the lunar features a uniform 
hue. If on the other hantl the meteoric mass merely pits the surface 
without being volatilized, the eil'ect will be to change the color for the 
area of that pit. Continuous pitting of the surface will ultimately 
reduce the whole surface to the same hue. 

Against this it may be said that a certain number of meteorites 
will fail to reach the face of the moon visible to us, owing to the 
earth's superior gravitative attraction, and that most meteorites will 
fall upon the hidden face. But again it nmst be remembered that 
the moon has not alwaj's rotated at its present speed, and that dur- 
ing the initial stages of its history it probably exposed every part 
of its surface equally to meteoric attack. If it ever possessed an 
atmospheric envelope, its loss must have been an early occurrence, 
and it can ]iot have acted as a protective mantle for long. If, on 
the other hand, it be assumed that the loss of the atmosphere is of 
recent date, then it is the more difficult to explain the absence of 
marked degi'adation by weathering in numy of the surface features. 

It ma}' be argued that it is possible that the earth and moon have 
but recently reached a part of space where meteors exist, and that 
therefore there has not yet been time for the falling bodies to pro- 
duce any marked effect upon the moon's surface. However, even if 
one or other of these arguments be accepted to account for the still- 
existing diversity of color evident upon the moon, there still remain 
to be exi)lained (a) why our satellite shows signs of expansion rather 
than of contraction, (b) why many of its features are so clear in 
spite of degradation due to differential contraction and expansion 
of its surface materials. 

Question (b) induces the idea that those features of the moon 
which are clear and sharp are so because the}' have not loTjg been 
exposed to the degradational forces; in other words that (hey are of 
comparatively recent origin. Both questions seem to be satisfactorily

solved when one applies to the moon Joly's^ well-known theories of 
radioactivity, which seek to account for geological periodicities upon 
the earth. 

We have accepted the assumption that the moon was originally 
derived from the outer layers of the earth. Therefore it must have 
the same radioactive constituents as our globe. Furthermore, radio- 
activity should be greater in the moon than in the earth, since the 
former contains a larger proportion of sial, and the lighter acidic 
rocks are more radioactive than the denser basic rocks. Density 
considerations lead us to expect that whereas the inner core of the 
moon is sima, a large part of its volume down to a very considerable 
depth beneath its crust will be of sial. Joly has advanced the hy- 
pothesis that in the earth, heat accumulations due to radioactivity 
beneath the continental blocks will escape when the substratum is 
liquefied, and the heated areas are brought beneath the thin ocean 
beds, through the crust being rotated over the liquid substratum by 
tidal drag. He has also shown that under this theory a continuous 
belt of land around the equatorial regions of the globe would be an 
unstable arrangement, for then no amount of slipping of the crust 
over the molten interior would provide any means of escape for the 
heat. The continuous belt would ultimately be broken up by melting. 

On the moon, however, not only is there a continuous belt of sial 
around the equatorial regions, but the whole surface of the sphere 
is underlain by a thick stratum of that material. Obviously heat 
accumulated within the moon due to radioactivity, can not escape by 
the means advocated for its dispersion in the earth. Only a period of 
cataclysmic vulcanicity marked by violent eruptions, rending of the 
crust and outpourings of lava can release the pent-up heat. It is 
to such revolutions that the surface phenomena of the moon may ten- 
tatively be ascribed, the state of excellent preservation of the younger 
features pointing to comparatively recent date for their formation. 

An examination of the moon's features appears to lend very sub- 
stantial support to this conception. Everywhere there are traces of 
exceptionally violent eruptions, craters occupying a very large 
proportion of the surface. That the largest craters as a general rule 
appear to have been formed first, confirms the expectation that the 
initial outburst of the compressed lavas would be of great violence. 
Concurrently the great rifts, clefts, and fractures were formed, as the 
thin skin of unmelted crust failed to extend to cover the now greater 
volume of the sphere. For, as heat accumulated within the crust, so 
would the constitutents of the interior tend to become liquefied and 
less dense. Only the intense pressure would keep them from lique- 
faction. However, a time would come when the crust was so far

MOON AND RADIOACTIVITY FORBES 211 

weakened from beneath as to be no lon<i^er strong; enough to resist the 
internal pressure. Once hiva had pierced the crust, pressure within 
would be lowered and rapid liquefaction and expansion would ensue. 
This subcrustal liquefaction would be confined to a substratum 
relatively thin when compared with the moon's radius. The lower 
limits of this stratum would be determined by the interaction of heat 
and the pressure of the superincumbent maj2jma and crust; the 
upper limits by the conductivity of the surface layers. The volume 
of the moon would be increased and lava would rise in the innumer- 
able fractures caused in the crust. Where the fractures were rela- 
tively narrow, lateral conduction in the cool upper layers of the 
crust would congeal the lavas before they could issue upon the sur- 
face. Where the fissures were wider, as we must suppose them to 
have been beneath the maria, conduction was insufficient to solidify 
the lavas, which thus were able to be extruded upon the surface. 
Evidence of internal expansion is seen in the linear arrangement of 
many groups of small vulcanoids, which mark lines of fracture in the 
crust. A fine example of this is the line of craterlets over 200 miles 
long between the vulcanoids Catherina and Abulfeda. 

Shaler* observes that ''those (fissures) which are in appearance 
sufficiently conspicuous to be mapped lie mostly in tlie central part 
of the visible surface, between the parallels of 30° north and south 
of the moon's equator and within 30° east and 50° west of the cen- 
tral meridian. They are thus remarkably rare in high latitudes 
and apparently seldom near the east and west margins of the visible 
part of the sphere. This apparent feature of distribution may be 
due to the oblique view of these marginal fields." That this dis- 
tribution is apparent rather than real as suggested by the previous 
sentence is unlikely, for surely if obliquity of view tends to render 
these features invisible, this effect should operate at equal distances 
from the central meridian, whereas this is not the case. 

An explanation of this distribution of the most conspicuous frac- 
tures may lie in the effects of tidal forces. The moon exhibits a 
fossil tide which has been estimated to be too large for the orbit 
it now occupies, the result of recession from the earth of the moon, 
and the inability of the latter to adapt its form to its position with 
reference to the earth. Liquefaction of the substratum would offer 
an opportunity of rapid adjustment of the moon's figure. The rift- 
ing of the proximal surface indicates that there the strains of adjust- 
ment were greatest, and a like area of rifting probably exists on the 
distal portion of the moon. Apparently the crust tended to frac- 
ture more on the proximal and distal areas, where it became re-

lieved of support by migration of subcrustal magmas in the direction 
of like latitudes on the limb, than the latter areas where it became 
subjected to a buoyant thrust. The present existence of an exces- 
sive fossil tide, indicates either that during the moon's last phase 
of volcanic activity its adjustment of form to its position was incom- 
plete, or that the excess is a measure of the moon's recession from 
the earth since the last phase of vulcanism. 

The maria occupy a third part of the moon's visible surface, and 
most observers are agreed that these are outpourings of lava, but a 
comparatively thin' layer upon the surface. Craters are relatively 
rare in these areas, owing no doubt to the fact that all but the high- 
est of them would be covered in the lava flows. That the formation 
of the maria occurred after most of the major craters appeared is 
inferred from the melting of crater walls by the maria, a phenome- 
non visible in numerous places. Failure of the maria to coincide in 
location with that area where fracture by tidal forces appears to 
have been most intense, seems to indicate that their positions were 
determined by another factor. Local fragmentation of the crust 
and consequent extrusion of the maria may have resulted from a high 
concentration of radioactive materials beneath those areas. Such 
areas would be characterized by higher temperatures than elsewhere. 
This would operate to thin the crust greatly, causing much fractur- 
ing, and would also render the magma more fluid than elsewhere, 
facilitating the flow of the extruded lavas. 

The maria occupy the loAver portions of the moon's surface. Bar- 
rell '^ supposes this depression to have been accomplished by the 
ejection upon the surface of magma from below the level of isostatic 
compensation. This loading of the crust with material heavier than 
any found above the level of isostatic compensation would cause a 
slight subsidence of the crust, which depression would be enormously 
increased by lateral compressive stresses. We have seen that the 
maria probably occupy the most fractured portions of the crust, and 
the addition of several thousand feet of lava, a relatively thin 
covering, does nothing to reinforce the strength of those shattered 
areas. As outlined in the following paragraph, lateral compressive 
stresses are likely to occur at the close of a revolution, shortly after 
the extrusion of the maria took place. These horizontal forces 
would naturally find easiest expression in the shattered parts of the 
crust covered by the maria. The maria are thus probably not in a 
state of isostatic equilibrium, since by far the greatest part of their 
subsidence must be ascribed to action of lateral compressive forces. 
The supposition is that they are of recent formation, geologically 
speaking, and are at present moving towards a condition of isostatic

equilibrium. Suess ^ was one of the first to note the depressions in 
wliich the maria occur. He observes that " The regular peripheral 
surface fractures which surround the Mare Hunioruni at some dis- 
tance from its margin, and other similar examples show, however, 
that in some cases the circular subsidence extends beyond the surface 
of the lava." The hypothesis herein adopted appears to be in good 
accord with this observation. 

The moon having got rid of that fraction of its accumulated in- 
ternal heat which brought about liquefaction of the substratum and 
consequent convection currents, its crust is now a little too big for 
its cooling and contracting interior. Some of its internal mass has 
also been lost by extrusions of lava upon the surface. The fissures 
originally formed in the extension of the crust can not now be 
closed again by the efforts of the outer envelope to contract with the 
shrinking substratum, for the fissures are filled with solidified lava. 
Accordingly the weakest parts of the surface are subjected to buck- 
ling and wrinkling as the more rigid parts of the crust are thrust 
against them. As outlined in the previous paragraph, the maria are 
particularly susceptible to further depression as the less fractured 
portions of the crust exert a lateral pressure upon them. Due to 
the same forces, the surfaces of the maria, while plastic are thrown 
into the numerous anticlinal folds which they exhibit. A partic- 
ularly fine example of this folding is visible in the Mare Serenitatis, 
where a meridional anticlinal chain with syntaxis and linking of 
arcs stretches from border to border. A meridional line of five small 
vulcanoids on the face of the same mare points to a line of fracture 
in the crust beneath the lava, which latter, subsequent to its extru- 
sion, was pierced by minor eruptions along the line of fracture. 

The existence of mountain ranges in close association with the 
maria, points to the fact that these too were caused by pressure in 
the crust striving to accomodate itself to a contracting interior. 
Where the rigid crust thrust itself most intensely upon the less rigid 
maria, the edges of the latter were crumpled and thrown up into 
the ranges which in many places border the maria. That the moun- 
tain ranges were elevated after the craters is shown by the fact 
that the latter are occasionally seen to be distorted or deformed by 
the former features. 

The terrace effect within many of the craters, due to stages in the 
sinking of the lava within them, may possibly be ascribed to lessen- 
ing of internal pressure as an adjacent mare was poured out upon 
the moon's face. Then each terrace would mark a pause in the for- 
mation of a mare, and the drop in the lava would he produced by a 
reduction in pressure due to renewed extrusions beneath the mare.

214 AlfKUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

As previously stated, there is strong evidence that the formation 
of the maria occurred at a late stage in the period of vulcanism. The 
earlier stages were characterized by the eruption of thousands of 
craters, and these must inevitably have discharged large volumes of 
gases. It is possible that these gases formed a temporary atmosphere 
which, even if very tenuous, operated to check the rapidity of loss 
of heat into space. Back radiation from gas molecules and fine par- 
ticles of suspended volcanic dust would reduce the rate of heat loss. 
Carbon dioxide is a common product of volcanic activity, and by 
reason of its density it would be retained at the moon's surface for 
a longer period than lighter gases. It predominates particularly 
during the closing stages of vulcanism, and would thus accumulate 
in largest quantities about the time of the extrusion of the maria. 
Under cover of this protective mantle, the lavas which formed the 
maria would assume a wider lateral extent than would have been 
possible had they been extruded at the inception of vulcanism when 
there was no atmospheric envelope to check loss of heat. Indeed, the 
extrusion of the maria may only have become possible when an atmos- 
phere was provided. If this gaseous envelope did exist, it would 
not have remained long after the close of vulcanism, but would have 
been dispersed into space, due to the moon's inability, owing to its 
small mass, to retain gases against their diffusive tendency for any 
extended period of time. 

The fissures on the high ground are those formed at the inception 
of vulcanism. A different explanation must be offered for those 
fissures seen upon the maria, especially as Shaler ^ states that these 
phenomena were amongst the last of the moon's features to be 
formed. These fissures appear to be rift valleys, and their occur- 
rence on the maria where obvious signs of compression are visible, 
is at first hard to explain. However, it is to be noted that the course 
of the fissures is at high angles to the prevailing direction of the 
ridges on the maria. In other words, the forces which raised the 
ridges would not tend to prevent the formation of the fissures, or 
to close them up if these latter were of earlier date than the ridges. 
The rift valleys on the maria can be ascribed to faulting above fis- 
sures in the surface upon which the maria were extruded. These 
fissures ran parallel to the line of the compressive forces which 
raised the ridges. In these deep-seated fissures the molten magma 
was sinldng with the contracting substratum, and the surface of the 
maria becoming relieved of support in these linear areas, sank, 
forming the fault troughs now visible. 

An alternative suggestion to that made previously regarding the 
origin of the ridges is that they were also formed above fissures in 

» Op. cit. 



MOON AND RADIOACTIVITY — FORBES 215 

the surface upon which the rrmria were extruded; but these fissures 
were at right angles to the compressive forces. These forces caused 
the magma in the deeply covered fissures to be squeezed upwards, 
ridging the surface of the maria. This will explain the absence of 
accompanj'ing synclines, which one would expect to find if the 
ridges had been formed by a simple wrinkling of the maria due to 
lateral pressure. 

Barrell ^" advances strong evidence in support of the assumption 
that the lunar craters were not formed all in one phase of vul- 
canicity. In the younger craters there is a sharpness of definition 
and a steepness of slope which is absent in the older craters. Craters 
of the former type are frequently superimposed upon the latter. 
The ancient craters give evidence of previous revolutions in the 
same way as do the stumps of denuded orogenic belts upon the 
earth. 

The freshness of many of the features on the lunar surface and the 
persistence of color gradations, induces the conclusion that a rev- 
olution has occurred recently, geologically speaking. The moon is 
now in a quiescent condition accumulating heat in the substratum, 
and therefore does not radiato any perceptible heat. As time ad- 
vances, the lunar features will inevitably lose their sharpness of 
detail and gradation of color, until a further period of vulcanism 
restores the surface to the condition which it now exhibits. During 
this future liquefaction of the substratum, the present excess ma- 
terial in the fossil tidal protuberances will tend to withdraw in the 
direction of low latitudes on the limb, with a renewed fracturing 
of the crust on the proximal and distal surfaces. Since the moon 
will by then have retreated further from the earth, its fossil pro- 
tuberances will be more disproportionately large than they are now. 

If we adopt the not entirely unreasonable assumption made earlier 
in this article, that the moon during part of its early history pos- 
sessed an atmosphere similar to the present terrestrial atmosphere, 
then the fact that no traces whatsoever of water action have ever 
been recognized upon its surface requires explanation. If we assume 
the original surface features to have been of nonvolcanic forma- 
tion, then the atmosphere may have become diffused into space 
before the eflFects of vulcanism were impressed upon the ancient sur- 
face. This vulcanism could be accounted competent to destroy any 
traces of water action which might previousl}' have existed. The 
conception of a revolution has had to be introduced to validate the 
hypothesis. 

If, on the other hand, we assume that the original features of 
the moon were volcanic in formation, then, as previously set forth, 

"Op. clt., pp. 304-.'i05. 



216 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

it is probable that the atmosphere was maintained until at least 
the close of vulcanism. Then the traces of water action may either 
have been obliterated by the agents of degradation previously enu- 
merated, or have been destroyed by a later phase of vulcanicity. The 
first explanation scarcely seems probable, since innumerable fine 
markings exist on the moon's surface which should have been oblit- 
erated if river courses had been hidden by the effects of degradation. 
The second explanation points to revolutions at a date subsequent 
to the loss of the moon's atmospheric envelope. The gaseous enve- 
lope temporarily provided by these phases of vulcanicity was appar- 
ently insufficient to impress upon the moon's surface the phenomena 
of water action. 

Taylor's suggestion " that the moon was acquired by capture dur- 
ing the early stages of the Tertiary, offers another explanation of 
the freshness of many of the moon's features. Then this can be 
explained by supposing that the moon has but recently arrived 
from a part of space where meteors do not exist. Again, if the 
moon were in a part of space far removed from any star, its sur- 
face temperature would be in the region of the absolute zero; nor 
would any temperature changes due to an external source be ex- 
perienced to degrade its features. Taylor seeks to explain the 
terrestrial Tertiary orogenesis by the capture of our satellite, but 
fails to advance a cause for the equally important periods of dias- 
trophism of earlier geological ages. However, even if this theory 
be adopted, we have still to explain the lack of signs of marked 
contraction, and the evidence of extensional tendencies beneath the 
moon's surface. 

According to Jeffreys,^^ orogenesis is probably due to horizontal 
crushing stress developed in the outer layer of the earth. This outer 
layer can undergo no further cooling and contraction, and is there- 
fore too large to fit the contracting substrata, which lie between the 
crust and the region at the center of the earth where no appreciable 
change of temperature takes place, and therefore no change of 
volume. 

We have seen that evidences of compression are visible upon the 
moon, but are not developed to that degree which would be expected 
if any consideration of its radioactive content were neglected, as has 
previously been the case. In this paper an attempt has been made to 
demonstrate that there are good foundations for believing that a far 
greater proportion of the moon's volume is composed of radioactive- 
rich materials than is the earth. The foregoing arguments induce 
the supposition that due to this high proportion of heat-generating

elements, our satellite has attained only that early stapfe of cooling 
where the surface layers aie too small to (it the interior, and therefore 
are faulted and rifted. Future evolution will move in the direction 
of coolinjx and contraction of the substrata, until the crust becomes 
too lar<;e to fit the interior. Horizontal crushiui; stresses will then 
be developed in the crust, causinjj diastrophism. Periodical revolu- 
tions resulting in a hydrostatic condition of the upper laj'crs of the 
substrata, will temporarily alFord a relatively rapid means of escape 
of heat b}' convection from the lower layers. Absence of marked 
contraction is thus ascribed to the present hi<}:h internal temperatures 
of the moon, and the lack of well-develoj)ed oro<renic belts of 
terrestrial type is tentatively accounted for under the main hypothesis 
adopted in this paper. 



MODERN CONCEPTS IN PHYSICS AND THEIR RELATION 

TO CHEMISTRY^ 



Bv Irving Langmuir 



Only about J^5 years ago, during the nineties of the hist century, 
knowledge of the physical sciences had advanced to such a point 
that many of the foremost physicists and cliemists began to be- 
lieve that the rate of progress of fundamental knowledge must be 
slowing up. The concepts of length, mass, time, energy, temperature, 
electric, and gravitational fields, etc., had been given precise meanings 
and were regarded as having an absolute existence quite as certain 
as that of matter itself. The phenomena of nature were explainable 
in terms of natural laws expressing relations between these absolute 
(}uantities. It seemed that the most important of these laws of 
|)hysics and chemistry had already been discovered and that the work 
that remained to do was largely a matter of filling in the details 
and applying these great principles for practical purposes. 

The laws of mechanics had been verified ex])erimentally with a 
high degree of precision so no one doubted that they were rigorous 
laws of nature. Back in about 1830, Hamilton had succeeded in 
generalizing these laws in a few simple equations which seemed 
to contain all the essential truths of mechanics. It was only necessary 
to know how the kinetic and potential energy of any given system 
varied with the momentum and the coordinates of its parts in order 
to have at least a formal solution of the way in which the system 
would behave at all times. Thus all future work in mechanics need 
only be considered an application of Hamilton's equations. 

Complete knowledge of the nature of light presented more diffi- 
culties. Hamilton, about 1820, showed that all the known laws of 
geometrical optics could be explained quantitatively in terms of either 
a corpuscular theory of light or a wave theory. The experiments of 
Fresnel on the interference of light which were made about this 
time, seemed to disprove Newton's corpuscular theory, so that Hamil- 
ton's proof of the complete analogy between waves and corpuscles

in the case of geometrical optics became only of academic interest. 
Through the study of the phenomena of interference, diffraction, 
polarization and absorption of light, the wave theory of light became 
firmly established. Light was supposed to consist of waves in some 
sort of an elastic medium which was called the ether. 

About 1830, Faraday developed clear conceptions regarding the 
electric and magnetic fields and Maxwell, about 1860, by applying 
exact mathematical methods evolved the electro-magnetic theory of 
light according to which light waves consisted of fluctuating electric 
and magnetic fields which are propagated through space at a speed 
which could be calculated from electric and from magnetic measure- 
ments in a laboratory. 

Although the acceptance of Maxwell's views came slowly one 
could not long remain skeptical after the production of electro- 
magnetic waves of relatively great wave length by Hertz in 1884. 
It may also be said that Maxwell's theory was essentially an applica- 
tion of the mathematical methods which Hamilton had originated in 
his treatment of the laws of mechanics, to Faraday's concepts of 
electricity and magnetism. 

Thus in 1895, the physicists seemed to have some justification for 
the attitude that the most important laws had been discovered. The 
laws of mechanics had not been improved upon in 65 years. Fara- 
day and Maxwell had brought in precise conceptions of electric and 
magnetic phenomena and had shown that by classical methods like 
those which had been so successful in mechanics, all the laws of optics 
could be derived from those of electromagnetism. 

In chemistry a somewhat similar state had been reached. After 
the evolution of the conception of the elements and of com- 
bining proportions based upon an atomic theory, rapid progress 
was made in accumulating data regarding the elements and their 
compounds. Faraday's laws of electrolysis and new methods for 
the accurate determination of atomic weights began to provide the 
chemist with quantitative laws almost as precise as those of the 
physicists. The work of J. Willard Gibbs had brought into chemistry 
rigorous laws as fundamental in their field of application as were 
those of Hamilton and Maxwell in physics. 

These remarkable advances on the quantitative side seemed to 
overshadow in importance the more qualitative results that had 
previously been obtained through the stimulus of the atomic theory. 
Under the leadership of Ostwald, chemists began to adopt a much 
more critical attitude and began to distinguish carefully between 
what they considered experimental facts and hypotheses based upon 
these facts. Ostwald, although he recognized the convenience of 
the atomic theory, believed it must always remain impossible to 



MODERN CONCEPTS IN PHYSICS — LuVNOMUIIi 221 

prove the existance of atoms or molecules. He therefore urged that 
chemists avoid as far as possible the use of sucii hypotiieses. Per- 
haps tlie cliief result of this altitude was to lead physical chemists 
to neglect those parts of chemistry where the atomic theory would 
have been most iielpful and to devote themselves more specially to 
the fiehls in which energy relationships and thermodynamics were 
directly applicable. 

Physicists in general did not doubt the existence of atoms and mole- 
cules, but had by means of this theory developed the kinetic theory 
of gases which had led to many new quantitative laws, verified by 
experiment. However, the physicists in general had little to do with 
atoms and molecules but were more concerned with the ether, in 
which they believed unreservedly, although direct knowledge of the 
ether was far harder to obtain than knowledge of atoms and 
molecules. 

Perhaps one of the main reasons why the physicists were so sure 
of the ether and the chemists so doubtful of the atoms and molecules 
was an unconscious belief in the respectable old adage '* Natura non 
facit saltum," Nature makes no jumps. Certainly in those fields 
of physics and chemistry in which rigorous quantitative laws had 
been found applicable no discontinuities or jumps such as those 
implied by the atomic theory had been found. 

The discovery of X rays by Roentgen, in 1905, marked the be- 
ginning of an extraordinary revolution which is today still in prog- 
ress. This sensational event revealed to the physicist that great and 
fundamental discoveries were still possible even in the field of radia- 
tion where physics had had such complete success. It immediately 
caused great numbers of physicists to study the phenomena of electric 
discharges and to look for other sources of radiation. The discovery 
of radium and radioactivity by Becquerel and the Curies soon 
showed the importance of these new forms of radiation to the 
chemist as well as to the physicist. 

Although Stoney in 1874 had seen that Faraday's laws of electro- 
lysis together with the atomic theory required that electricity should 
also have an atomic structure, and although in 1891 he proposed the 
name electron for these atoms of electricity, J. J. Tiiomson should 
be regarded as the discoverer of the electron. He was able to show 
that electrons were contained in all forms of matter and found that 
the electron nmst weigh only about Visoo as much as a hydrogen 
atom. 

The studies of radioactivity, largely by Kutherford and his stu- 
dents, showed that radium spontaneously disintegrated to form 
helium and proved to the chemist that atoms were not indestructible 
and even that transmutation of elements was possible.

By the application of thermodynamics to radiation processes 
Boltzmann proved that the total radiation, of all wave lengths, 
within a cavity in a heated body must increase in proportion to the 
fourth power of the absolute temperature; this law had already 
been found empirically by Stefan. By a further development of 
thermodynamic methods Wien, in 1896, derived an important law, 
known as Wien's law, b}^ which the intensity of radiation of any 
particular wave length could be calculated in terms of the wave 
length and temperature. This law was found to agree with experi- 
ment in the case of visible radiation from incandescent solids, but 
serious discrepancies were observed when an attempt was made to 
calculate the intensity of infra-red radiation or heat waves. Lord 
Rayleigh and Jeans, in 1900, using what seemed to be unimpeachable 
methods based on the electromagnetic theory of light, arrived at an 
entirely different relation between the intensity of radiation and 
the temperature and wave length. This equation agreed excellently 
with experiments on the radiation of heat where Wien's law had 
failed but led to absurd results when applied to the shorter wave 
lengths of the visible spectrum. In fact, if the total radiation in- 
cluding all wave lengths were calculated from the Rayleigh-Jeans 
equations an infinite radiation density was obtained even at low 
temperatures. Thus by means of the classical theories of radiation 
it was found on the one hand by Boltzmann that the radiation in- 
creased with the fourth power of the temperature, and on the other 
by Rayleigh-Jeans, that the radiation was infinite at all temperatures. 

It was shown in 1905, by Planck, that this paradox could only 
be solved by assuming an essential discontinuity in the energies or 
motions of electrons whose vibrations caused the radiation. This 
gave birth to the quantum theory, which within recent years has 
grown to be one of the most important theories of physics and 
chemistry. In 1906, Einstein showed that the photo-electric effect 
and many photochemical reactions could be explained in terms of 
the quantum theory if light itself consisted of discrete particles of 
energy or quanta, now usually called photons. Although such a 
corpuscular theory of light seemed utterly incompatible with the 
accepted wave theory, an increasing number of phenomena were 
discovered in which it seemed necessary to resort to this corpuscular 
theory. The really rapid development of the quantum theory, how- 
ever, dates from 1913, when Bohr began to develop his theory of 
atomic structure by applying the quantum theory to Rutherford's 
more or less qualitative theory of the nuclear atom. 

RELATIVITY THEORY 

Among all the changes in the ways of thinking which were being 
forced upon physicists at this time, the most important by far was 



MODERN CONCEPTS IN PHYSICS — LANGMUIR 223 

that which resulted from Einstein's relativity theory, first stated in 
1905. In 1895, as we have seen, electromagnetic waves and matter 
were thought to be manifestations of the properties of an all 
pervading ether. 

As an example of the way that the physicists thought of the ether 
I will quote from the preface to Lord Kelvin's Baltimore Lectures. 
This preface was written in 1904, but the lectures were those that 
were delivered at Johns Hopkins University in 1884. 

I diiise ns subject the " Wavo tlieoi'j' of light" with the intention of 
acxjentuathig Its failures ; rather than of setting forth the admirable success 
with which this beautiful theory had explained all that was known of light 
before the time of B>esnel and Thomas Young, and had produced floods of new 
knowledge splendidly enriching the whole domain of physical science. My 
audience was to consist of professorial fellow students in ithysical science. 
• * • I spoke with absolute freedom and had never the slightest fear of 
undermining their perfect faith in ether and its lighl-^'iviiig waves by any- 
thing I could tell them of the imperfection of our mathematics, of the insuffi- 
ciency or faultiness of our views regarding the dynamical qualities of ether, 
and of the overwhelmingly great difficulty of finding a field of action for ether 
among the atoms of ponderable matter. We all felt the difficulties were to be 
faced and not to be evaded ; were to be taken to heart with the hope of solving 
them if possible. • * • It is in some measure satisfactory to me and I hope 
it will be satisfactory to all my Baltimore coefficients still alive in our world 
of science, when this volume reaches their hands to find in It dynamical 
explanations of every one of the difficulties ^^ith which we were concerned 
from the first to the last of our 20 lectures of 1884. All of us will, I am sure, 
feel sympathetically interested in knowing that two of ourselves, Michelson 
and Morh'y, have by their great experimental work on the motion of ether 
relatively to the earth, raised the one and only serious objection against our 
dynamical explanations. 

This Michelson and Morley experiment of 1887, through the 
theoretical investigations of Lorentz and others, kept growing in 
importance until it finally stimulated Einstein to evolve his relativity 
theory. 

According to this theory space and time can not be considered as 
existing independently of each other. They can not in any sense be 
regarded as absolute but are both dependent upon the point of view 
of the observer. For example, Einstein showed that it has no 
meaning to say that two events which took place at a great distance 
apart occurred simultaneously. Some observers knowing of both 
events would have to say that event A occurred before B, while 
other observers moving at a different velocity from the first observers 
would conclude that B occurred before A. 

It is not my plan to try to explain the relativity theory to you even 
if I knew how to do so, but it is rather to discuss the way in which 
this theory and others of a somewhat similar nature have gradually 
brought about profound changes in the viewpoint of the physicistg 



224 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

and how similar changes are beginning to occur in the attitude of 
the chemists. The importance of Einstein's work thus lies not so 
much in the facts or phenomena that can be explained by the rela- 
tivity theory, but in the discovery of a new way of thinking as 
applied to physics. Somewhat similar methods of thought had, it 
is true, been used in some branches of mathematics and sometimes 
in philosophy, but Einstein subjected our elementary conceptions of 
space, time, mass, energy, etc., to a searching analysis quite new in 
the history of physics. 

CONCEPTS INVOLVE OPERATIONS 

Prof. p. W. Bridgman, of Harvard University, has recently written 
a popular book entitled "The Logic of Modern Physics," in which he 
analyzes the changes in our concepts that have resulted primarily 
from Einstein's work. Bridgman's thesis is that physical concepts 
have meaning only in so far as they can be defined in terms of opera- 
tions. He shows that this new attitude toward our fundamental con- 
ceptions is perhaps one of the greatest changes that has been brought 
about by Einstein's work. There is no question in my mind but that 
the recent remarkable advances in quantum mechanics that have been 
made by such men as Bohr, Heisenberg, Schroedinger and Dirac have 
been stimulated by the desire to formulate all concepts in terms of 
operations. Bridgman has not originated this method, but he, more 
than anyone else, perhaps, has been conscious of its widespread appli- 
cation in modern physics. 

I should like to outline to you the way in which Bridgman de- 
velops this thesis and to consider how well it applies to the most 
recent changes that have taken place in physics and in chemistry. I 
believe the chemist can derive great benefit from the conscious appli- 
cation of a similar critical attitude in his own science. 

Bridgman points out that " hitherto many of the concepts of 
physics have been defined in terms of their properties." An excellent 
example is Newton's concept of absolute time. The following quota- 
tion from Newton's Principia is illuminating. 

I do not define Time, Space, Place, or Motion, as being well known to all. 
Only I must observe that the vulgar conceive those quantities under no other 
notions but from the relation they bear to sensible objects. And thence arise 
certain prejudices, for the removing of which, it will be convenient to distin- 
guish them into Absolute and Relative, True and Apparent, Mathematical and 
Common. 

(1) Absolute, True and Mathematical Time, of itself, and from its own nature 
flows equally without regard to anything external, and by another name is 
called Duration. 

Thus, according to Newton, time and space have properties of a 
very abstract kind and are looked upon as "things" which exist inde- 



MODERN CONCEPTS IN PHYSICS — LANGMUIR 225 

pendently of all other things. There is, however, as Bridgraan says 
"no assurance whatever that there exists in nature anything with 
properties like those assumed in the definition, and physics, when 
reduced to concepts of this chanicter, becomes lus purely an al)^tract 
science and as far removed from reality as the abstract geometry of 
the mathematicians." Nevertheless, these conceptions of space and 
time prevailed until the relativity theory was proposed. 

In the development of this theory Einstein, in analyzing the con- 
cepts of space and time, considered wliat means arc available by 
which an observer can measure distances between two points on a 
rapidly moving object. For example, imagine two planets moving 
past each other at high velocity and two observers, one on each 
planet, provided with means for observing each other and communi- 
cating with each other; such means, for example, as light signals. 
Einstein asks, what are the operations by which the two observers 
could compare their units of length and time? He finds that each 
observer would logically conclude that the other observer's unit of 
length is shorter than his own, and that the other's unit of time is 
longer than his own. Einstein thus proved that there can be no 
such thing as absolute length or time, or rather proved that the con- 
cept of absolute time has no meaning, for we have not been able to 
conceive of any method for determining the absolute time of any 
event. 

In order to illustrate his thesis Bridgman considers in detail the 
concept of length. Probably one of the earliest concepts of length 
was obtained by counting the number of unit lengths that can be 
placed end to end between two given objects. For example, the 
number of paces are counted in walking from one object to another. 
An extension and refinement of this method is employed to-day when 
the standard meter at the Bureau of Standards is compared with a 
steel tape and this is then used to lay off a base line for a survey 
by triangulation. 

As Bridgman suggests, it was one of the greatest discoveries of 
the human race to find that these operations performed with a 
measuring rod afford a useful and convenient means of describing 
natural phenomena. 

During the transition from the earliest pacing of distances, to our 
modern refined measurements with the meter stick, the concept of 
length itself must have undergone radical modifications since the 
operations involved had been modified. For example, if distances are 
to be paced, it has no meaning to consider distances of Tthsu of a 
pace unless the concept is modified to include arbitrarily chosen 
methods by which a length equal to toW of a pace may be deter- 
mined. In our modern measurements with a steel tape we must 



226 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

measure the temperature of the tape and the force used in holding 
the tape taut, and then by means of the coefficient of expansion and 
the coefficient of elasticity, apply corrections to the observed length. 
It is hard to see what methods primitive man could have used in 
applying such corrections to his distances measured by pacing. 

Why do we now apply such corrections? Merely because it has 
been found by experiment that the result that we get by applying 
such corrections is a quantity which proves to be more useful in 
describing natural phenomena than the results we get without these 
corrections. We must not think that we do it in order to obtain the 
" true " or " absolute " length. 

To-day we have many other methods of measuring length than by 
use of measuring rods or steel tape. For example, we use optical 
instruments and measure distances by triangulation, we measure 
heights in the atmosphere by means of a barometer, we measure the 
distances of spiral nebulae by measuring the brightness of the 
Cepheid variables observed in them by our most powerful telescopes, 
we measure the lengths of molecules by finding the area of a water 
surface over which a given amount of oil will spread, we calculate 
the diameters of molecules by measurements of the viscosity of gases 
by means of the kinetic theory, or we use X-ray diffraction patterns 
or, finally, we calculate the diameter of an electron from its mass 
and charge by means of the electromagnetic theory assuming that 
all the energy of an electron lies in the electric field outside of its 
surface. 

Now each of these measurements of length involves an entirely dif- 
ferent set of operations and, therefore, fundamentally, according to 
Bridgman, we should regard them as different concepts; logically, 
in fact, they should all have different names. It has, however, been 
found as a matter of experiment that two or more of these methods 
when applied to the measurement of the same distance give results 
which agree more or less with one another. This, then, is our justi- 
fication for calling all these concepts by the same name, length. 

We may, if we wish, extrapolate and predict that by applying 
suitable corrections to each of these methods of measuring lengths 
we may be able to get better and better agreement between them. 
Such methods of extrapolation may be useful and stimulating but 
we must always expect that sooner or later we will be unable to 
obtain agreement between these methods with more than a limited 
degree of accuracy. This may not be due merely to experimental 
difficulties but may often result from unavoidable fuzziness in the 
concept itself. Such concepts as the diameter of a complicated mole- 
cule, or the mean free path of a molecule in a gas are inherently fuzzy 
conceptions and can mean not much more than when we speak of 



MODERN CONCEPTS IN PHYSICS — LANGMUIR 227 

the diameter of a tree or of the length of the waves during a storm 
at sea. 

Perhaps the strongest reason for the general belief in the existence 
of an absolute space lay in the apparently perfect agreement between 
our measurements of lengtli and the theorems of Euclidian geome- 
try. During the last century, however, mathematicians began more 
and more to realize that Euclidian geometry was only one out of 
many possible logical geometries, and since all of these were based 
solely on certain axioms or postulates none of them had any real or 
necessary connection with physics. The apparent agreement between 
our physical observations and Euclidian geometry, therefore, does 
not prove that space must have the properties postulated in Euclid's 
axioms. 

MODELS 

As chemists we are all more or less familiar with various models of 
atoms and molecules that have been proposed within recent years. 
The structural formulas which the organic chemists have used for 
a good part of a century are another example of an extremely useful 
type of model. I want to discuss later some of the models which the 
physicists have used in giving more concrete forms to their theories. 
Logically, I believe, we should regard Euclidian geometry as a model 
devised primarily to help us '' explain " natural phenomena. 

Observation of nature reveals great complexity. We receive enor- 
mous numbers of impressions simultaneously and if we are to make 
progress in understanding phenomena we must concentrate on certain 
aspects of the things we see about us and thus discard the less im- 
portant features. This involves a process of replacing the natural 
world by a set of abstractions which we have become very skilful in 
choosing in such a way as to aid us in classifying and understanding 
phenomena. Thus it was found useful to develop concepts or ab- 
stractions such as shape, position, distance, etc., and separate these 
characteristics of the phenomena from others such as color, hard- 
ness, etc Euclidian geometry was found useful in correlating these 
concepts of shape, position, etc. 

Physicists and chemists have usually felt that they understood a 
phenomenon best when they could explain it in terms of a model or 
concrete picture. The chemist explained the law of multiple com- 
bining proportions in terms of atoms which combine together to form 
molecules. The heat conductivity, viscosity, etc., of gases was ex- 
plained in terms of the kinetic theory, with molecules making elastic 
collisions with one another according to the law of probability. 

When we use the atomic or molecular theories to explain phenom- 
ena in this way, we assign to the atoms and molecules only those 
properties which seem needed to accomplish the desired result; we 



228 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

do not consider what the atom is made of nor what its structure is, 
but usually feel justified in assuming properties which are as simple 
as possible. For example, in the elementary kinetic theory it is 
assumed that the molecules are hard, elastic spheres, not because 
anyone really believes that molecules have these properties, but 
merely because these are the simplest properties we can think of 
which are consistent with the known facts. 

What we really do, therefore, is to replace in our minds the actual 
gases which we observe and which have many properties which we 
do not fully understand by a simplified model, a human abstraction, 
which is so designed by us that it has some of the properties of the 
thing we wish to displace. 

There is thus a difference of degree rather than of kind between 
the adoption of a mechanical model and the development of a math- 
ematical theor}?- such as Euclidian geometry. When the mathe- 
matical physicist develops an abstract theory of actual phenomena — 
for example, Hamilton's equations to summarize the laws of me- 
chanics — he is in reality constructing a mathematical model. Math- 
ematical equations have certain definite properties or rather they 
express certain relationships between the symbols which enter them. 
In a mathematical theory of physical phenomena the equations are 
so chosen that the relation between the symbols corresponds in some 
simple way to that which is observed between measurable physical 
quantities which are the bases of our concepts of physics. 

Within recent years, especially in the development of the rela- 
tivity and quantum theories, physicists have been making increasing 
use of mathematical forms of expression, and have been giving less 
attention to the development of mechanical models. The older gen- 
eration of physicists and chemists and those among the younger men 
who are less skilled in the use of mathematics are inclined to believe 
that this is only a temporary stage and that ultimately we must be 
able to form a concrete picture or model of the atom, that is, to get 
a picture of what the atom is really like. It seems to be felt that a 
mechanical model whose functioning can be understood without the 
aid of mathematics, even if it only gives the qualitative representa- 
tion of the phenomena in question, can represent the truth in some 
higher sense than a mathematical theory whose symbols perhaps can 
be understood only by a mathematician. 

There is, I believe, no adequate justification for this attitude. 
Mechanical models are necessarily very much restricted in scope. 
The relationships of their parts are limited to those that are already 
known in mechanics (or in electricity or magnetism). Mathematical 
relationships are far more flexible ; practically any conceivable quan- 
titative or qualitative relationship can be expressed if desired in 



MODERN CONCEPTS IN PHYSICS LANGMUIR 229 

mathematical form. We have no guarantee ^vhatever that nature is 
so constructed that it can be adequately described in terms of ine- 
chanicid or electrical models; it is much more ])robable that our most 
fundamental relationships can only be expressed mathematically, if 
at all. 

In analyzing our attempts to describe nature, we have discussed 
concepts, models and mathematical theories. We iind that they are 
all alike in that they represent hunum abstractions which are found 
convenient in describing nature. Going back a step further we must 
recognize that words themselves constitute elementary concepts. 
They are, it is true, much more vaguely defined than our concepts of 
physics and chemistry, but qualitatively they are very much like the 
latter; in fact, most of our misunderstandings in science arise from 
assigning reality to concepts wiiose main reason for existence is the 
fact that they are represented by a word. Logically we should aim 
to deline our words in terms of operations. We should have in mind 
speciHcatioiis by which we can test whether or not the word is prop- 
erly applicable. 

The progress of science depends largely upon (1) giving to words 
meanings as precise as possible; (2) dehnition of concepts in terms 
of operations; (3) development of models (mechanical or mathe- 
matical) which have properties analogous to those of phenomena 
which we have observed. 

MEANINGLESS QUESTIONS 

A great deal of time and eflfort is wasted in scientific circles as 
well as in the world at large through failure to give sufliciently 
definite or useful definition of words and concepts. Bridgman em- 
phasizes this in connection with his discussion of " meaningless 
questions." 

In some cases questions fail to have meaning because of the more 
or less inherent fuzziness of the concepts involved. For example, 
if we compare two trees of about the same size it may have no 
meaning to ask which tree has the larger diameter, for no one has 
defined the diameter of a tree with tlie necessary precision. 

A more important class of meaningless questions arises when 
there are no conceivable operations that could be performed to 
arrive at a decision. For example, what is the meaning of the 
question, "Would the United Stales have entered the World War 
if the Lusitania had not been sunk? " Such a question may be a 
good subject for a school debating society, but no one is apt to 
think that the question has thereby been answered. 

A study of meaningless questions may serve a very useful purpose 
in science. A statement that a certain question has no meaning may 
28095—31 16 



230 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

be equivalent to stating a fundamental law of nature; for example, 
to say that the question, " What is the true velocity of the north star 
through space? " has no meaning is a fairly good statement of at 
least a part of the relativity theory. 

In some cases it may have no meaning to ask whether or not 
there is a magnetic field in a certain portion of space. For example, 
suppose an observer, stationary on the earth, studies an electron in 
motion. The motion of an electron constitutes an electric current 
and experimentally he will observe the characteristic magnetic field 
surrounding this electron corresponding to this current. If another 
observer moves along with the electron, it will appear to him to be 
at rest, and, of course, he can observe no magnetic field. Otherwise, 
the presence or absence of a magnetic field around an electron or 
group of electrons could be used to determine absolute motion 
through space, which would be contrary to the relativity theory. 
The relativity theory thus requires that a magnetic field can have no 
real existence in any absolute sense. 

We have seen that there are fundamentally as many different con- 
cepts of length as there are different ways in which length may be 
measured; nevertheless, we find approximate agreement between 
different ways of measuring the diameter of molecules and therefore 
are justified in assigning some reality to the concept diameter of a 
molecule. When, however, we ask what is the diameter of an elec- 
tron, we find that the question is practically without meaning. It is 
true that we can calculate a diameter by assuming that the electron 
behaves like a charged sphere and that the classical laws of electro- 
dynamics can be applied in this case. However, since we have no 
independent way of measuring this diameter, the process is one 
which involves reasoning in a circle. 

There are many meaningless questions which afflict the chemist. 
It clearly has no meaning to ask what is the molecular weight of 
sodium chloride in a crystal. It is very doubtful whether it has any 
meaning to ask what is the molecular weight of water in liquid 
water. There are many cases where the concept of temperature has 
no definite meaning. Strictly speaking, temperature acquires mean- 
ing in terms of operations only in so far as an approach is made to 
equilibrium conditions. When the motions of molecules or atoms 
follow Maxwell's distribution law, that is, a random or probability 
distribution of velocity among the molecules, the concept of tempera- 
ture becomes very definite. If, however, we deal with mercury 
vapor streaming into a high vacuum, or the conditions near a hot 
tungsten filament in a gas of low pressure, temperature has very 
little meaning. The same is true of the conditions frequently exist- 
ing in an electric discharge tube such as a mercury arc, where the 



MODERN CONCEPTS IN PHYSICS — LANQMUIR 231 

electrons act as tliou^h they had a temperature of perhaps 50,000°, 
whereas the atoms have motions corresponding to far lower tempera- 
tures. Strictly speakinj;, neitlier the electrons nor atoms have well- 
defined temperatures, for the conditions are far removed from 
equilibrium. 

In much of the recent discussion of tlie radiation hypotliesis of 
chemical reactions, chemists have been discussing meaningless ([ues- 
tions usually without realizing it. At first it was proposed that the 
radiation is absorbed by the reacting gas to form excited molecules 
in accordance with Einstein's photochemical law. When this is 
found not to be in accortl with experiment, tlie concept of radiation 
is alti'red repeatedly as new experimental facts are found so as to 
make the modified tlieory continue to lit the facts. After this process 
lias been carried on sufficiently, it no longer has any meaning to ask 
whether the reaction is caused by radiation or whether the radiation 
liypothosis is true. 

In the studies of the properties of liquids, questions of the degree 
of ionization and of association and in some cases of internal pres- 
sures have been discussions of questions without meaning. A great 
deal of such discussion might be simplified or even avoided entirely 
if chemists would agree in defining these concepts in terms of 
operations. 

Theories of valence within recent years have been afflicted with the 
same difficulties. As long as chemists deal with the ordinary valence 
rules of organic ciiemistry, they are dealing with concepts of valence 
which are actually defined in terms of operations; that is, the organic 
chemists know how to conduct experiments to prove that the valence 
(jf nitrogen in dimethylaniline is 3. The types of operations needed 
to establish the valence of magnesium in magnesium chloride are in 
many ways quite different, and they are still different if we consider 
the case of so-called quin(}uevalent nitrogen in ammonium chloride or 
heptavalent chlorine in perchloric acid. I believe that the chemist 
has much to learn from the physicist in regard to the proper method 
of attacking such problems as these. 

The electrochemist has been troubled in locating the source of 
electromotive force in cells. The physicist has similar difficulty in 
finding the origin of the contact potential between metals. Funda- 
mentally it must be recognized that unless or until there are methods 
by which these quantities can be measured, questions involving them 
have no meaning. 

A practical example of the meaninglessness of some questions in- 
volving electric potential has recently arisen in the numerous pro- 
posals that have been made to construct a speed indicator for 
airplanes which will give the speed with respect to the earth s surface 



232 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

independently of that of the wind surrounding the plane. It is 
reasoned that since the plane is moving through the earth's magnetic 
field a potential will be set up between the ends of a wire stretched 
between the wing's tips. It is only necessary to measure this poten- 
tial diiFerence in order to calculate the speed of the jjlane with 
respect to the earth. Careful analysis shows that the concept of the 
potential difference under these conditions is meaningless except with 
reference to a particular reference system. If this system is referred 
to the plane itself, this potential difference is zero quite regardless 
of what the sj^eed of the plane may be with reference to the earth. 
A contrary result would conflict with the relativity theory. 

Meaningless questions will assume far greater importance in future 
years. We shall see that the latest forms of the quantum theory now 
give us the best of reasons for believing that the identity of separate 
electrons within atoms or molecules may be partly or wholly lost, so 
that it may have no meaning to ask whether a particular electron we 
find as a result of experiment is the same electron which has pre- 
viously produced an observed phenomenon. Even more far-reaching 
in its consequences is the Bohr-Heisenberg uncertainty principle ac- 
cording to which it has no meaning to ask what is the precise position 
and velocity of an electron or atom. An electron may have a definite 
position or a definite velocity but it can not in any exact sense have 
both. This doesn't mean merely that there are experimental difficul- 
ties in measuring them, it means that the concepts themselves (posi- 
tion and velocity) are relative to one another in a sense somewhat 
analogous to that of time and space in the relativity theory. 

One's instinctive reaction when first questioned as to the objective 
reality of space, time, position, velocity, etc., is to object to such 
consideration on the grounds that they are too metaphysical. The 
recent advances in physics demonstrate that these methods of think- 
ing are eminently practical; they represent, in fact, an attempt to 
get away from the metaphysical character of much of our thinking 
in the past. Instead of taking for granted objective realities cor- 
responding to our concepts, we now deal with things which can be 
measured in the laboratory, the concrete data that we have to 
start from. 

It is, however, very useful to retain the concept of reality. Bridg- 
man suggests that reality should be measured by the number and 
the accuracy of the independent ways in which we arrive at similar 
measures of the concept in question. For example, owing to the 
fact that we have so many concordant methods of measuring the 
distance between the ends of a base line used for triangulation, we 
attribute great reality to the concept of length or, rather, to those 
concepts of length which are applicable in cases of this kind. We 



MODERN CONCEPTS IN PHYSICS — LANQMUIR 233 

thus have some justification in saying that two points are really 
one kilometer apart. We do not attribute, however, much reality 
to the concept of the diameter of an electron. 

Thirty years aijo the physical chemist doubted the existence of 
atoms or believeil the com-ept was useless if nt)t pernicious. A few 
years later the leader of this movement, Ostwald, in the preface of 
one of his books stated that he believed that the existence of atoms 
had been proved experimentally beyond question, althou^di in pre- 
vious books he had stated that there are always an infinite number 
of hypotheses that could be advanced to explain any given set of 
experimental facts. 

To-day, what can we say in answer to the question " Does matter 
really consist of atoms?" Must we say that this is one of those 
meaningless questions? 

Of course, the amount of meaning that can be attached to any 
such question depends upon the definitions of the words and con- 
cepts which it contains. If we mean by atoms indivisible and in- 
destructible infinitely hard, elastic spheres, we are compelled to 
answer the question in the negative. In accordance with modern 
usage, however, we do not attribute any such properties to the atom. 
If, by the use of the word atom, we mean to imply principally the 
concept that matter consists of discrete particles which can be 
counted by the various methods which are now known for this 
purpose, we have the very best of reasons for answering the ques- 
tion in the affirmative. If in our studies of nature we discover 
evidences of discontinuities or of the presence of discrete natural 
units which can be correlated in a definite way with the numerical 
integers, we have come, it would seem, about as close to something 
absolute in nature as we can hope to get. Einstein in the relativity 
theory has taught us to look upon the intersections of world lines 
as the data upon which our observations of nature rest. Such 
points of intersections, which can be called events, are essentially 
discontinuities. In general they are all unlike one another. When 
we find in nature discrete units which in many respects appear to 
be identical with one another, and we can count these units, it would 
seem that the number of these units which obtain as a result is apt 
to be independent of our system of reference; therefore, they have 
in general, a certain kind of absolute significance. 

In this respect, therefore, it seems that the atomic theory and the 
quantum theory in which integers play such a fundamental role 
may be considered as representing reality to a higher degree than 
almost any other of our physical and chemical theories. 

Skepticism in regard to an absolute meaning of worils, concepts, 
models or matheuuitical tlieories should not prevent us from using 



234 ANNTTAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

all these abstractions in describing natural phenomena. The prog- 
ress of physical chemistry was probably set back many years by the 
failure of the chemists to take full advantage of the atomic theory 
in describing the phenomena that they observed. The rejection of 
the atomic theory for this purpose was, I believe, based primarily 
upon a mistaken attempt to describe nature in some absolute manner. 
That is, it was thought that such concepts as energy, entropy, tem- 
perature, chemical potential, etc., represented something far more 
nearly absolute in character than the concept of atoms and molecules, 
so that nature should preferably be described in terms of the former 
rather than the latter. We must now recognize, however, that all 
of these concepts are human inventions and have no absolute inde- 
pendent existence in nature. Our choice, therefore, can not lie be- 
tween fact and hypothesis, but only between two concepts (or 
between two models) which enable us to give a better or worse 
description of natural phenomena. By better or worse we mean, 
approximately, simpler or more complicated, more or less convenient, 
more or less general. If we compare Ostwald's attempts to teach 
chemistry without the use of the atomic theory with a good modern 
course based upon the atomic theory, we get an understanding of 
what should be meant by better or worse. 

The more recent advances in atomic theory which have resulted 
from the development of the quantum theory and which have given 
us our present knowledge of atomic structure, afford us interesting 
applications of the new methods of thought, first introduced into 
physics and chemistry by the relativity theory. 

The older atomic and molecular theories of the chemists took on 
more definite form through the development of the kinetic theory 
of gases, and through the electron theory and the study of radio- 
activity developed to a point where the atom is conceived of as con- 
sisting of a definite number of electrons revolving around the nucleus. 
The atom ceased to be indestructible and was no longer the smallest 
particle of matter which could take part in a chemical reaction. 
The nucleus, rather than the atom, became characteristic of the chem- 
ical elements. The chemical properties of the atom, however, de- 
pended upon the number and arrangement of electrons. 

Bohr, in 1913, developed a marvelous new theory of the atom by 
combining Planck's quantum theory with a relative theory of the 
nuclear atom. He evolved several new quantitative mathematical 
relationships with new concepts such as energy levels, quantum states, 
etc., and showed how the spectra of elements could be explained 
in terms of these new concepts. He also gave a mechanical model 
consisting of electrons revolving in orbits about the nucleus accord- 
ing to laws which were partly classical and partly inconsistent with 



MODERN CONCEPTS IN PHYSICS LANQMUIR 235 

classical laws. This model enabled him to derive certain mathemat- 
ical equations from which he was al)le to calculate the frequencies 
corresponding to the dilierent lines in the spectra of hydrogen and 
other elements, these frequencies being obtained from fundamental 
quantities such as the charge and mass of tlie electron and the quan- 
tum constant A, and did not involve any quantities dependent on the 
properties of the elements in question. The agreement between the 
theory and experiment was practically perfect, often enabling tiie 
frequency to be calculated with an accuracy of one part in 200,000. 

Such remarkable success made most physicists and chemists be- 
lieve that Bohr's model, for the hydrogen atom at least, was sub- 
stantially correct. That is, the}' believed that Bohr's work proved 
that in a normal hydrogen atom the electron really described a 
circular orbit around a nucleus having a diameter and a frequency 
given by Bohr's model. Bohr himself never attached any such 
importance to the mechanical model, realizing that the important 
steps that he had taken consisted mainly in the introduction of new 
concepts and more particularly in the mathematical equations by 
which the observed frequencies in the spectral lines could be 
calculated. 

"Within recent years, largely through the work of Bohr himself 
and his students, and Sommerfeld, Schroedinger, and others, this 
theory of the hydrogen atom has undergone changes. According to 
Bohr's original model the radiation of energy corresponding to a 
spectral line resulted from transition in which the electron passed 
from one stationary orbit to another. No physical picture of this 
transition seemed possible. To account for the known phenomena 
it seemed necessary that the transition should occur so rapidly that 
the electron would have to move from one orbit to another with a 
velocity greater than that of liglit, and yet the train of waves in 
the resulting radiation lasted for relatively long periods of time, 
about 10'' seconds. Kadiant energy could be absorbed by the atom 
only if the frequency was just that which was capable of trans- 
ferring an electron from one orbit to another definite orbit. Thus 
only one frequency could be absorbed at a time by an atom. It 
was found, however, that the frequencies corresponding to many 
lines could be scattered by a single atom. This seemed to reciuire 
the presence within any given atom of a number of oscillators as 
great as the number of lines in the spectrum. One of the greatest 
arguments in favor of the original Bohr theory was that it avoided 
just this sort of complication in the atom. 

To get rid of difliculties such as these, Heisenbrrg and Bohr real- 
ized that it was necessary to sweep out of the theories of atomic 
structure the many concepts which were characteristic of the me- 



236 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

chanical models that had been proposed and to develop a mathe- 
matical theory of the atom which would involve only concepts that 
were definable in terms of operations. That is, the theory was one 
that dealt more directly with measurable quantities such as the 
frequencies of spectral lines. New methods of matrix calculus had 
to be evolved, a kind of calculus of discontinuities or discrete quan- 
tities instead of the calculus of continuous quantities which had 
characterized classical mechanics. 

Only a little later Schroedinger, by developing De Broglie's wave 
theory of quantum phenomena, was able to build up a theory that 
we will now refer to as the wave mechanics, according to which 
the whole atom with all its electrons can be looked upon as a wave 
phenomenon. The electrons are no longer considered to be moving 
in orbits. For example, the hydrogen atom is found to have spheri- 
cal symmetry instead of the axial symmetry of the old Bohr model 
of the atom. Yet this theory leads to identically the same equations 
for the frequencies of the lines in the hydrogen spectrum. We must 
not say that Bohr's theory of the hydrogen atom has been over- 
thrown. Bohr's TTiechanical model has been superseded, but the 
more important model which is represented by the equations and 
the concepts which he evolved is even better to-day than it was 
when it was first proposed. 

The wave mechanics which involves the calculus of continuous 
variables is not now in conflict with the Bohr matrix calculus of 
discrete quantities. The two theories are essentially merely different 
mathematical methods applied to a single fundamental problem. 
The resulting mathematical equations alwa3's agree with one another. 
One begins to believe that the mathematical theory is a far better 
model of the atom than any of the mechanical models which are 
possible. 

The long-standing conflict between the wave theory of light and the 
corpuscular quantum theor}'^ now disappears with the new wave 
mechanics, the two aspects of light being somewhat analogous to the 
two aspects of the quantum theory, the wave mechanics and the 
matrix mechanics. In fact, the quantum theory now indicates that 
the electron itself can be regarded as a particle, or as a wave, just 
as light can be thought of as a photon or a wave. Whatever re- 
mained of the conflict between the wave and corpuscular theory of 
light and of the electron seems now to be fundamentally removed 
by the Bohr-Heisenberg uncertainty principle. To ask whether 
an electron is a particle or a wave is a meaningless question ; the same 
is true of the question whether light consists of corpuscles or waves. 
One must answer that both of these are particles or waves accord- 
ing to the kind of operations that we may perform in observing 



MODERN CONCEPTS IN PHYSICS — LANGMUIR 237 

them. If we make an experiment which proves that an electron 
has a very definite position, then it Nvoukl seem to prove that it is a 
particle. In that case, however, according; to the uncertainty prin- 
ciple, we are not able to determine accurately the velocity and there- 
fore can not predict where the particle will <^o. • 

Bohr has emphasized that the essential reason that the classical 
theory falls down in any detailed description of atomic phenomena 
is that our knowledge of such atomic systems can only be obtained 
throujLrh an act of observation which makes the observer inherently a 
part of the system. On the classical theory we assume that we 
could have knowledge of a completely closed system as though it 
were possible to know anything of what would go on in a strictly 
closed system. In order to make an observation some signal must 
be transmitted from the system to ourselves, and if we take this 
interaction completely into account we are forced to the quantum 
theory with its uncertainty principle. 

An interesting feature of this new quantum mechanics is that 
the original conception of the relation between cause and effect 
which was universally accepted in science has lost its meaning. 
Atomic processes seem to be governed fundamentally by the law 
of probability. It has no meaning to ask when a particular radium 
atom will disintegrate, for no operation is conceivable by which such 
an event could be predicted. The same is true of every individual 
quantum process. We have no guarantee whatever that the expul- 
sion of an a-particle from an atom of radium has any immediate 
cause. In chemistry the formation of nuclei in supercooled liquids, 
etc., must be essentially quantum phenomena in which no cause can 
be assigned for the formation of the individual nucleus. By vary- 
ing the conditions we may alter the probability that a nucleus will 
appear at a given point, but in no absolute sense can we ever make a 
nucleus form through a direct cause. 

By a deeper analysis of this question of causality Bohr concludes 
that we have an option af two alternative descriptions of natural 
phenomena. If we choose to describe phenomena in terms of ordi- 
nary space and time then we must abandon causality. We may, 
however, retain the conception of causality if we are willing to 
describe atomic phenomena in terms of what the mathematician calls 
configuration space. Consider, for example, a helium atom with its 
two electrons. If we attempt to give the position of both of these 
electrons in space wo would need a set of 3 coordinates, x, y. /, for 
each of the electrons, that is, G coordinates in all, 3 of which belong 
to one and '^ to the other electron. The mathematician, however, 
finds that the 2 electrons in general could also be described by 1 
point in G-dimensional space, for such a point has G coordinates. 



238 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

This is a representation of 2 electrons as a single point in a con- 
figuration space of 6 dimensions. Now it turns out from Schroe- 
dinger's theory that the motion of electrons, or rather of the waves 
corresponding to them, can be completely described in the case of 
the helium atom by. a quantity which has a particular value at each 
point in this 6-dimensional space or configuration space. The 
helium atom, however, can be described in terms of the motion of 
2 electrons in 3-dimensional space if we are content merely to know 
the probabilities that the electrons may be found at any point in 
this space. 

These matters undoubtedly seem very abstract to those of you 
who have not previously become familiar with them. I give them 
here mainly in order to illustrate how far the modern concepts of 
physics differ from those of 20 years ago. 

If we must thus abandon our ordinary ideas of cause and effect, 
it may be asked why have the physicist and chemist so long believed 
that the whole teaching of science gave proof that every phenomenon 
resulted inevitably from the causes that led to it. I think the 
answer is that in the past scientists chose as the subjects for their 
investigations almost wholly those phenomena in which such definite 
relations as cause and effect could be found. These phenomena are 
those in which such enormous numbers of individual quantum phe- 
nomena are grouped together that the result is determined only 
by their averages. For example, when we study the variation of 
the pressure with the volume of a gas, the forces that we measure 
result from the impacts of great numbers of molecules, the average 
force remaining steady and definite. If, however, we only had one 
molecule in a small volume, the pressure exerted on the walls would 
be zero except for those instants at which the molecules struck the 
wall. It would then be impossible to predict in advance what the 
pressure would be at a particular time. 

I think in trying to estimate the reliability of any of our scientific 
loiowledge we should keep in mind that the whole complexion of a 
science may be made to change by the psychology of the investi- 
gators which governs the choice of the subjects that are investigated. 

Our best knowledge of time and its relation to other concepts is that 
which we have obtained through Einstein. Yet in the whole rela- 
tivity theory there is nothing to distinguish between positive and 
negative time, that is, between future and joast, any more than there 
is between different directions in space, such as right and left. There 
thus appears to be something curiously incomplete in our knowledge 
of time, for every one of us knows the vast practical difference be- 
tween past and future. Eddington, in his recent book, the Nature of 
the Physical World, discusses the " arrow of time " at some length. 



MODERN CONCEPTS IN PHYSICS — LANGMUIR 239 

He suggests that the second law of thermodynamics is the only iunda- 
mental law of nature which provides us with any distinction between 
future and past. One way of stating this law is that all spontaneous 
proi esses that occur in nature involve an increase in entropy. Ed- 
dington thus proposes that the positive direction of time can bo 
deiined as that direction in wiiich the entropy increases. If we had 
a system in absolute equilibrium the entropy would be constant, and 
there would then be no arrow of time. This is in accord with the 
fact that in such a system there are no changes with time. 

It is improbable that there are two independent fundamental fac- 
tors which ])rovide an arrow for time, so that it would seem that 
Eddington in having found one such factor has found the only one. 
There are, however, grave difliculties with this view. An arrow is a 
vector quantity which should have magnitude as well as direction. 
Now the rate of change of entropy does not seem to give us any 
measure of time. For this purpose we use phenomena which are as 
nearly reversible as possible, such as the swinging of a pendulum in 
a vacuum. 

Fundamentally entropy is a measure of randomness. A random 
distribution of molecules in space and velocity is a system having the 
maximuHi entropy. If we throw a pack of cards out of the window 
and collect them from the ground they have become effectively 
shuffled. We would not expect by this process, starting with a 
shuffled pack of cards, to find them at the end in the order in which 
they come from the manufacturer. The direction in which the ran- 
domness increases thus provides an arrow for time. This arrow is, 
however, equivalent to that involving the increase of entropy. 

It is still an open question, however, whether processes directed by 
intelligent beings may not involve a decrease in entropy. In fact it 
seems conceivable that the evolution of organic life on the earth is in 
some measure fundamentally contrary to the second law of thermo- 
dynamics. The inherent tendency of evolution seems to be to bring 
about an ordered rather than a random arrangement of parts, and in 
the future perhaps forms of life may evolve which cause a decrease 
of entropy on a large scale. Are we then to have some parts of the 
universe in which the arrow of time points in the opposite direction 
from that in neighboring parts? 

Such speculations may seem fantastic. It is, however, I believe, of 
the utmost importance for the chemists and the physicists to evolve 
fundamentally sound conceptions of such things as time and entropy. 

The profound changes in physical thought, particularly those 
represented by the quantum theory, arc rapidly bringing about a 
revolution in physical chemistry. The third law of thermodynamics 
involving chemical constants has changed ra(lic:dly oui- methods of

studying chemical equilibria. The application of the quantum 
theory to band spectra promises to be of the utmost importance in 
chemistry. By enabling us to determine the moments of inertia 
of chemical molecules, the actual distances between the nuclei of the 
atoms in molecules can be found. Apparently our most accurate 
determinations of the heats of dissociation of elementary gases can 
be obtained from the band spectra through a knowledge of the 
energy levels of the various possible states of the molecules. In 
recent numbers of the Journal of the American Chemical Society, 
particularly in the paper of Giauque and Johnston, we see the be- 
ginnings of what promises to be the most accurate and fertile source 
of knowledge of chemical equilibria. From a detailed knowledge of 
the spectrum, for example, of oxygen, and without recourse to any 
other experimental determinations, the specific heat at all tempera- 
tures can be calculated, and the entropy of oxygen at all tempera- 
tures is thus found. This, together with the heats of reactions, 
which may be found by a similar method, makes possible the calcula- 
tion of the degree of dissociation of oxygen and will ultimately make 
possible the calculation of all chemical equilibria. 

The remarkable work of Dennison, Bonhoeffer, and Eucken in pre- 
dicting and isolating parahydrogen should prove to the chemist how 
many of his chemical discoveries will be obtained in the future by the 
application of these new theories of physics. 

Gurney and Condon have recently derived from the wave 
mechanics an explanation of the fundamental law of radioactivity. 
Similar methods will probably before long enable us to understand 
the processes involved in chemical reactions far better than we ever 
have before. 

Physics and chemistry are being inevitably drawn closer together. 
It seems that there has never been a time when we can predict with 
such certainty rapid progress in fundamental chemistry, for the new 
theories of physics have as yet scarcely begun to be applied in the 
field of chemistry. The physicist on the other hand has much to 
learn from an increased knowledge of chemical phenomena which 
should provide him with a richness of experimental data far greater 
than any he has yet had an opportunity to use. 

Unfortunately, although theoretical physics and chemistry are 
thus supplementing each other and in many respects are being 
merged into a new science, there are remarkably few men as yet that 
have received adequate training in both sciences. Before long, I 
hope, sharp distinctions between physics and chemistry will no 
longer exist, but at present there seems to be a very practical 
distinction. 



MODERN CONCEPTS IN PHYSICS — LANQMUIR 241 

In order to find approximately how many chemists are also active 
as physicists and vice versa. I have selected at random 100 pa<:;es of 
the fourth edition of American Men of Science (rJ27) which con- 
tains the names of 13,500 American scientists. Of these, approx- 
imately 2,700 are classed as chemists and 7G0 as physicists. Of the 
chemists 87 per cent ai'c members of the American Cliemical Society, 
while only 2.5 per cent belong also to the American Physical Society. 
Seventy-seven per cent of the physicists are members of the American 
Physical Society, while 8.;3 per cent are also members of the Ameri- 
can Chemical Society. Thus only about 3 per cent of the physicists 
and chemists of the United States, whose names are given in the 
American Men of Science, belong to both of the national societies. 
This leaves far too small a number of men who are ca|)able or are 
properly prepared to carry on the impoitant work of bringing these 
two sciences close together. 

To pave the way for the coming revolutionary changes in chemis- 
try we mu.st be prepared to modify our methods of thinking, prob- 
ably along lines now so prevalent in physics. But above all we must 
urge young chemists in the universities and after graduation to be- 
come thoroughly well trained in mathematics and in modern physics. 



WAVES AND COKPUSCLES IN MODERN PHYSICS ' 



By Louts de Broolik 



[With 2 plates] 



A study of the properties of common bodies leads us to put them 
into two classes: Composite bodies, which may be chanjied into more 
simple ones by appropriate operations, and simple bodies, or ele- 
ments, which resist all attempts at reduction into simpler ones. An 
examination of the quantitative laws, following which these sim- 
ple bodies, or elements, unite to make the composite ones, has led 
chemists for a century to adopt the following theory : a simple body 
is formed of small particles, each the same and called the atoms of 
this simple body; composite bodies are formed of molecules made by 
the union of several of these atoms. According to this hypothesis, 
the dissociation of a compound body into the elements of which 
it is composed means the breaking up of its molecules and the set- 
ting free of the atoms which the latter contain. The number of 
these simple bodies or elements actually known is 89. It is believed 
that in all there will finally be found 92. Therefore out of 92 differ- 
ent species of atoms all material bodies are constructed. 

The atomic theory has been successful not only in chemistry but 
also in physics. If the substances of bodies are made of molecules 
and atoms, then their physical properties should be interpretable 
from their atomic constitution. The pro})erties of a gas, for exam- 
ple, should be capable of explanation, supposing it to be formed of a 
very great number of atoms or of molecules in rapid movements. 
The pressure of a gas upon the walls of its container will be due to 
the blows of the molecules upon these walls; the temperature of the 
gas should be related to the mean agitation of these molecules, this 
agitation increasing as the temperature rises. This conception of a 
gas has been developed as the " Kinetic theory of gases " and has 
led to an explanation of the gas laws revealed by experiment. If 
the atomic theory is a proper representation of nature, the proper-

ties of solid and liquid bodies should be amenable to interpretation 
by picturing the molecules and atoms in such states as existing much 
closer to each other than in the gaseous state. The considerable 
forces which should then be expected to exist between the atoms and 
molecules should lead to an accounting for the properties of incom- 
pressibility, cohesion, etc., which characterize solids and liquids. 

The atomic theory of matter has been confirmed by remarkable 
experiments such as those of M. Jean Perrin which permitted him to 
measure the number and weight of the divers atoms within a cubic 
centimeter. I will indicate hefe merely that the weight of an atom 
is extraordinarily small, yet the number per cubic centimeter is al- 
ways enormous under ordinary conditions. 

Without going further into the development of the atomic theory, 
we will merely add that in physics as in chemistry, the hypothesis, 
according to which all bodies are composed of molecules which them- 
selves are built up of divers combinations of elementary atoms, has 
proved itself very fruitful and should be considered a good model of 
reality. 

The physicists, however, were not content to stop here. They 
wished to proceed further — to know the structure of the atoms — in 
what way the various elements themselves differed from each other. 
In this task they were aided by the progress which had come in their 
knowledge of electrical phenomena. From the very beginning of 
the researches into the study of electrical processes it had seemed 
useful to treat electricity as a fluid — to suppose, for example, that 
the electric current passing through a wire was the flowing of some 
fluid through it. But as you know, there are apparently two kinds 
of electricity, positive and negative. Consequently it was natural to 
postulate the existence of two fluids, a positive fluid and a negative 
fluid. We may picture these fluids in two different ways: It is 
possible to suppose the fluid to be a continuous substance occupying 
uniformly the region it occupies ; or better, to suppose it to be formed 
of clouds of small corpuscles, each corpuscle being a small ball of 
electricity. Experimental evidence has decided in favor of the 
latter. For some 30 years we have known that negative electricity 
is composed of small corpuscles, all identical and of extraordinarily 
small masses and electrical charges. These corpuscles of negative 
electricity have been designated electrons. It has become possible 
to eject these electrons out from matter and then study their 
behavior as free electrons in a vacuum. It has been shown thus that 
their motions are such as would be predicted by the laws of classical 
mechanics for small electrified particles. The study of the behavior 
of these small particles in electric and magnetic fields has led to the 
measurement of their size and electrical charge. These are extremely 



WAVES AND CORPUSCLES — DE BROOLIE 245 

small. The experimental knowledge of the corpuscular structure of 
positive electricity is less direct; nevertheless, physicists have reached 
the conviction that positive electricity is also subdivided into cor- 
puscles, all the same in kind, and now called '' protons." The proton 
has a mass, which, although very small, is nearly two thousand times 
greater than that of the electron. Its charge is equal to that of the 
electron but of contrary sign, positive instead of negative. 

Electrons and protons have extraordinarily small masses; never- 
theless this mass is not zero and an enormous number of protons 
make a total ma.ss of considerable amount. It is therefore tempting 
to suppose that all material bodies, essentially characterized by 
weight and inertia, in other words, by mass, are built of an enor- 
mous number of protons and electrons. Looking at the matter in 
this way, the atoms of which the elements arc composed and which 
are the materials from which all boelies are constructed, must be 
formed of protons and electrons. The 92 different atoms constitut- 
ing the elements must be 92 different a.ssemblages of protons and 
electrons. 

The idea that atoms are formed from electrons and protons has 
been elaborated through the experimental work of the great English 
physicist. Sir Ernest liutherford, and the theoretical studies of the 
Danish scientist, Niels Bohr. The atom of a simple body is supposed 
to be composed of a central nucleus carrying a positive charge equal 
to a whole number X times the charge of a proton and N electrons 
circulating about this nucleus. The assemblage is therefore electri- 
cally neutral. Without doubt the nucleus itself is formed of protons 
and electrons, the number of protons exceeding by N units the num- 
ber of electrons. Almost all the mass of the atom is seated in the 
nucleus since this contains the protons. The protons are far more 
heavy than the electrons. The simplest atom is that of hydrogen. 
It is made up of a nucleus containing a single proton with one elec- 
tron revolving about it. 

What distinguishes the atom of one element from that of another 
is the number N of elementary positive charges carried within the 
nucleus. We can accordingly arrange these elementary bodies in a 
series formed of increasing values of N from hydrogen (N = 1) to 
uranium (N = 92). We may note that the order in which these 
bodies fall in such an arrangement is precisely that which would 
result from their atomic weights and chemical properties and which 
is known as the Mendcleeff classification. 

I can not explain here in detail the idea that the atom is a kind 
of solar system formed of protons and electrons as has been advo- 
cated by the physicists. I will limit my.self merely to saying that 
it allows the interpretation not only of the chemical properties of 
the elementary bodies but also of a number of their physical prop- 
28005—31 17 



246 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 

erties such as the composition of the himinous rays they are capable 
of emitting under definite conditions, for instance, when they are 
heated to incandescence. 

There is one point which we must note. In order to develop in 
a satisfactory manner this theory of an atom similar to a solar sys- 
tem, Bohr had to introduce a strange idea which he united with the 
theory of quanta earlier developed by Planck. I have just indi- 
cated that in the experiments where we can follow the motion of an 
electron, the latter behaves like a small corpuscle of very small mass 
and that its motion can be predicted by the laws of classical me- 
chanics. But let us take into consideration the movements of an 
electron in trajectories of very small dimensions — motions which we 
can not follow in detail in experiments but which we needs must 
imagine in developing certain theories and explaining certain facts. 
Planck found by his calculations that such movements could not be 
predicted only from the laws of classical mechanics. To be more defi- 
nite, among all the motions predictable in ordinar}^ mechanics, only 
certain ones could be followed by the electron ; these privileged ones 
having been designated " quantized orbits." In his theory of a solar- 
modeled system, Bohr found it necessary to add this idea of Planck, 
for in the atoms the trajectories of the planetary electrons are 
necessarily of very small dimensions. He found that the electrons 
could execute quantized orbits only; in a manner this circumstance 
gave the key to all the atomic properties. 

Let us summarize briefly what we have said. The study of the 
properties of matter has led physicists to think of it as formed of 
little corpuscles — electrons and protons. Various assemblages of 
these corpuscles form the atoms of the 92 simple elements; from 
these are formed the composite bodies; in turn, from the latter is 
made all matter, which therefore is composed of corpuscles of known 
mass and charge and which in their movements obey the laws of 
classical mechanics. 

However, when we consider movements taking place on a very 
small scale, the corpuscles seem incapable of making most of the 
movements which the laws of classical mechanics would authorize. 
They can take only certain quantized paths. This odd circumstance 
warns us that it is doubtless insufficient to consider the ultimate ele- 
ments of matter, the electrons for example, as being merely small 
corpuscles. This manner of considering the electrons must be modi- 
fied and completed in a way suggested by certain light phenomena. 
Accordingly we must turn our thoughts to some phenomena 
concerning light. 

Light which comes to our eyes from the sun or the stars has 
traversed immense space where matter is absent. Light passes with- 
out difficulty through a vacuum and, differently from sound, is not 



WAVKS AND CORPUSCLES — DE BROGLIE 247 

bound U|) with matter. Our conception of the physical worlil there- 
fore will not be complete unless another phenomenon independent 
•of matter be added to it, namely, \\fi,ht. 

But what is li<^ht ^ Of what is it constituted? 

The j)hilosophers of antitjuity and many scientists up to the be- 
ginning; of the last century maintained that li«rht was made up of 
small corpuscles in rapid movement. The propa'ijation of light in 
straight lines under usual conditions, as well as the reflection of 
light by mirrors, was easily explained by such an hypothesis. 

The corpuscidar theory of light had been abandoneil for a century 
following the experiments of Young and Fresnel. Young and Fres- 
nel had discovered a large class of light plienomena — those relating 
to interference and diffraction — the interpretation of which was im- 
possible by the corpuscular theor}'. However, another conception, 
the wave theory of light, as Fresnel admirably showed, explains both 
the older class of })henomena — the rectilinear propagation of light, 
its reflection and refraction — as well as the later class connected with 
interference and ditfraction. 

The uiidulatory conception of light had been upheld previously 
by certain farseeing geniuses like Christian Hu3'ghens, who thought 
that light should be compared to the propagation of a wave in an 
elastic medium; for instance, like the movement of a ripple upon the 
surface of a sheet of water upon which a stone has been cast. Since 
light passes through a vacuum, Fresnel imagined a sort of subtle 
medium, the ether, which impregnated all matter, lilling the empty 
spaces and serving as a basis for the propagation of the luminous 
wave. 

Let us now consider how a luminous wave is conceived. Light 
freely propagated is analagous to a succession of waves of which the 
crests are separated by a constant distance called the '* wave length." 
A group of these waves moves in the direction of propagation with 
a definite velocity known as the '* velocity of light." For light waves 
in vacuo this should be taken as 300,000 km./sec, as has been meas- 
ured by experiments made since the death of Fresnel. At an\' given 
point in space the difl'erent waves with their crests and troughs pass 
successively. The magnitude which is ])ropagated by the waves 
therefore varies at a given point periodically and the period of that 
variation is evidently equal to the time which elapses between the 
passage of two successive crests. 

We have just seen how a wave moves forward in a region where 
there is nothing to hinder its progress. A different action occurs 
when the wave in its motion impinges u])on an obstacle, for example, 
if it encounters a plane surface which stops and reflects it; or if it 
must pass through apertures pierced in a screen ; or further if it en- 
counters a point wliich diffuses it. Then the disturbance will be- 



248 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

have as if deformed, bent back upon itself, so that instead of having 
a simple wave we will have to deal with a superposition of simple 
waves. The state of oscillation at any point depends upon the re-, 
suit of the superposition of the various waves, an effect sometimes 
additive, at times subtractive. If the simple waves are additive, or 
as we may say, are in the same phase, a very strong oscillation re- 
sults; if, on the other hand, the waves oppose each other, or, as we 
may say, there is an opposition of phase, then the resultant vibration 
will be very small or even possibly zero. Now it can be shown that 
the existence at a point of concordance or discordance of phase de- 
pends essentially upon the wave length of the wave wiiich happens 
to strike the obstacle. Resuming, the presence of an obstacle dis- 
turbs the passage of a w^ave, causing the appearance of a complicated 
distribution of vibration intensities depending essentially on the 
wave length of the original wave. There result the phenomena of 
interference and diffraction. 

If we adopt this idea that light is made up of waves, we are 
led to predict that if obstacles hinder the free passage of the bundle 
of rays, then the phenomena of interference and diffraction will 
make their appearance. Within the region of interference the dis- 
tribution of light will be complicated but we can easily predict 
it from the wave length of the light, that is to say, from the color 
of light employed. Young and Fresnel showed that light exhibits 
the phenomena of interference and diffraction. Fresnel showed fur- 
ther that the conception of light waves sufficed to explain in every 
detail all the observed phenomena of interference and diffraction. 
On the other hand, the theory which considers light as being simple 
moving corpuscles can not lead to the conception of wave lengths 
and is wholly incapable of explaining interference. Following 
Fresnel, and during the whole of the last century, the undulatory 
conception of light was admitted without opposition. 

You know there exist divers kinds of simple light, each corre- 
sponding to a definite color. The white light given out by an 
incandescent body, an electric light, for instance, is made up of a 
continuous sequence of simple lights of which the colors vary pro- 
gressively by imperceptible gradations from violet to red, forming 
what we call the spectrum. The wave theory of light naturally 
led to the designation of the quality of each component of the spec- 
trum by its wave length; that is, there exists a correspondence 
between wave length and color. Since interference phenomena de- 
pend upon the wave length, they give us a means of measuring the 
wave length corresponding to each color of the spectrum. And 
so we have been able to determine that the wave length varies, 
increasing continuously from the violet end of the spectrum where 



WAVES AND CORPUSCLES — DE BROGLIE 249 

it is about 4/10,000 ol" ji millimeter, to the extreme red where it 
attains a length of 8/10,000 of a millimeter. 

There exist in nature oiher waves analoi^ous to these li^'ht waves 
but to which the eyes are not sensitive. We are able to show their 
existence by various methods and to measure their wave lengths. 
They are included under the general designation '* radiations," a 
term which also includes light waves. Certain radiations (ultra- 
violet, X and A rays) have wave lengths shorter than those of 
light; others, (infra-red, Hertzian) on the contrary, have longer 
wave lengths. X rays have wave lengths of the order of 1/10,000,000 
of a millimeter. They therefore have a very much shorter length 
than the visible ones. 

Thirty years ago no one questioned the undulatory theory of light. 
Since then hitherto unknown phenomena have come to light produced 
by radiatic»ns which did not appear to be explainable except by the 
corpuscular theory. The principal one of these phenomena was the 
photo-electric effect. Here are its characteristics: When we illu- 
minate a piece of matter, a metal, for example, with either light or X 
ra^-s, this piece of matter emits electrons, moving more or less 
rajjidly. A study of this phenomenon showed that the velocity of 
these expelled electrons dei)ends only on the wave length of the 
incident light or X rays and the nature of the matter upon which 
tiiis radiation falls. It does not depend upon the intensity of the 
radiation. Only the number of emitted electrons depends upon that 
intensity. Further the energy of the expelled electrons varies in- 
versely with the wave length of the incident wave. Einstein, re- 
flecting upon this phenomenon, saw that in order to explain it, 
it would be necessary to return to a corpuscular structure of light. 
He supposed that the radiations are made up of corpuscles trans- 
porting an energy inversely proportional to the wave length of the 
light and showed that the laws of the photo-electric effect can be 
readily deduced from such an hypothesis. 

And so it came to pass that the physicists were much embarrassed, 
because on the one hand there was a class of phenomena, the phe- 
nomena of interference and diffraction which indicated that light 
must be made up of waves, and on the other hand there was the 
photo-electric phenomenon, as well as other evidence, which as 
insistently indicated that light must be made of corpuscles or 
" photons " as they are now called. The new corpuscular theory of 
Einstein defines the energy of a light corpuscle in terms of a 
wave length, which is foreign to the idea of a strictly corpuscular 
radiation. 

The only way to escape from this difficulty is to admit that light 
is formed of waves and corpuscles so closely bound together that 
they behave as two complementary aspects of reality. Each time that 



250 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

a radiation exchanges energy with matter, the exchange can be de- 
scribed as being an absorption or emission by the matter of a photon, 
and when we wish to describe the movement in space of corpuscles 
of light we must speak of the propagation of a wave. Elaborating 
further this conception, we are led to admit that the density of a 
cloud of corpuscles, which constitutes a luminous wave, is always at 
every point equal to the intensity of the associated wave. It thus 
happens that we come to the synthesis of two old rival theories of 
light. We thus explain at the same time both the interference phe- 
nomena and the photo-electric effect. Great interest lies in this 
s-ynthesis because it indicates to us that in nature both light waves 
and the corpuscles of matter are intimately connected, at least in 
the case of light. But if this is true with light, may we not also 
expect it to be true with matter ? Until now all the efforts of physi- 
cists have tended to reduce matter to a complicated structure of 
corpuscles, photons, and electrons. But just as a photon can not be 
conceived without its wave which travels with it, should we not also 
suppose that the corpuscles of matter are always escorted by a wave ? 
Such is the leading question now asked of us. 

Let us suppose that a corpuscle of matter, an electron, for example, 
is always accompanied by a wave, the corpuscle and the wave being 
intimately bound together. The movement of the corpuscle and 
the propagation of the wave are not independent, and we should be 
able to obtain a relationship between the mechanical magnitude of 
the corpuscle — the velocity and the energy — and the magnitude 
characterizing the wave — the velocity of propagation and the wave 
length. In suggesting the connection which should exist between 
the protons and their associated light waves, we can indeed estab- 
lish a parallelism. This theory of the bond between the material 
corpuscles and their associated waves is to-day know as wave me- 
chanics. Naturally I can not to-day lay before you the details of 
this mechanics. I will limit myself merely to telling you that it 
leads to attributing a wave length to the wave associated with the 
material corpuscle, a value which varies inversely with the velocity 
of the corpuscle. The more rapidly the corpuscle moves, the smaller 
is the wave length of the associated wave. 

When the wave moves freely in a portion of space whose dimen- 
sions are large compared with the wave length, the new mechanics 
attributes to the associated particle a movement identical with that 
predicted by the classical mechanics. There is therefore here an 
accordance between the old and the new mechanics. Particularly is 
this the case with the electrons which we can observe directly, and 
we thus explain why the study of the electron movements on a large 
scale led to considering them as simple corpuscles moving according 
to the laws of the classical mechanics. 



WAVES AND CORPUSCLES HE BROGLIE 251 

But we meet with two cases where the hiws of chisjsical mechanics 
fail to predict the movements of the corpuscle as will the new theory. 
The first case is where the propairation of the associated wave is 
limited to a region of space of which tlie dimensions are of the 
order of magnitude of the wave length. This occurs for an electron 
in the interior of an atom. The wave associated witli the atom is 
then obliged to take the form of a stationary wave analogous to the 
elastic stationary waves which may occur in a cord fixed at both 
ends or the stationary electric waves which form in the antennae 
used for wireless telegraphy. Theory shows that these stationary 
waves can take only certain well-defined wave lengths corresponding 
to certain definite movements of the associated electron. These move- 
ments are precisely the quantized states introduced by Bohr in his 
theory of the atom and we now have an explanation of the hitherto 
very mysterious fact that these quantized states are the only possible 
ones for an electron bound to an atom. 

There is a second case where the movement of the electrons, ac- 
cording to the laws of the new mechanics, should not obey the laws 
of the classical mechanics. This is where the associated waves strike 
an obstacle in the path of propagation. Interference phenomena are 
then produced and the movements of the associated corpuscles are no 
longer what would be expected from the classical mechanics. In 
order to render an account of what takes place, let us be guided by 
an analogy with radiations. Let us imagine tliat we observe a radia- 
tion of known wave length with a contrivance capable of showing 
interference upon a screen. Since we know that the radiations are 
formed of photons, we can just as well say that we see a swarm of 
photons upon the screen. In this conception, in the places where in- 
terference takes place, the photons arrange themselves in such a 
manner that they become concentrated where the light intensities are 
the greatest. If we now send upon the same screen, not a radiation 
but a bundle of electrons of which the associated waves have the same 
wave length as the radiation previously employed, the waves will 
interfere in the same manner as in the preceding case since it is this 
wave length which controls the phenomena of interference. It is 
therefore quite natural to suppose that the electrons are concentrated 
there where the intensity is the greatest; in other words, in the new 
experiment the electrons arrange them.«elves in space similarly as did 
the photons in the first experiment. If we can prove that this is 
indeed the case we would then have shown the existence of a wave 
associated with an electron and we could measure its wave length, 
establi.shing the truth of the fundamental basis of wave mechanics. 

Now, wave mechanics leads us to attribute to electrons moving 
with such speeds as usually occur in our experiments, an associated 
wave whose wave length is of the order of that of X rays (0,0001 



252 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

of a millimeter). In order to show the existence of the associated 
electronic waves, it is necessary to try to realize with them phenomena 
of interference analogous to those which we get with X rays. Phe- 
nomena of this nature have been obtained. The first physicists who 
succeeded in obtaining such results were Messrs. Davisson and Germer 
of the Bell Laboratories in New York. But I am not going to de- 
scribe their experiments; instead I will tell you of the beautiful 
results, analogous in nature, although slightly different, which were 
made later by G. P. Thomson in England and by M. Ponte in France, 
for M. Ponte has had the kindness to lend me the photographs so 
that I may lay before your eyes the actual results. 

When we send a pencil of X rays upon a powder composed of 
small crystals oriented in random directions the X rays are diffused 
by the regularly arranged molecules in the small crystals and inter-

ference takes place between the diffused X rays. Theory predicts 
that if we place a photographic plate perpendicular to the pencil 
of rays incident upon the plate in the manner shown in Figure 1, 
the X rays should affect the photographic plate in circles centered 
upon the direction of the incident ray. Experiment verifies splen- 
didly the prediction and we have upon the plate rings which are 
black upon the negative itself but white as shown in the positive 
reproduced in Plate 1, Figure 1, 

The diameter of the rings depends upon the nature of the crystal- 
line substance employed as a diffusing means and upon the wave 
length of the radiation. If with the same diffuser we employ X-ray 
radiations of shorter and shorter wave lengths the system of rings 
moves toward the center. 

We may employ in the place of the powder of small crystals a very 
thin metallic plate. The study of the structure of metals has shown 
that they are formed of a conglomeration of small confused crystals. 



WAVES AND CORPUSCLES — DE BROOLIE 253 

The experiments which we liave just described, which appear to 
liave been lirst nnide by my brother Maurice before the war, are 
generally known as the experiment of Debye and Scherrer. They 
prove the wave structure of X rays, but that was already known be- 
fore these experiments. If now we repeat these experiments with 
electrons, we would have a proof of the wave character of the elec- 
tron. This was realized by Messrs. Thomson and Ponte. M. Ponte 
proceeded as follows: He sent a bundle of electrons upon a film of 
zinc oxide formed of little crystals of this substance. Then plucinj^ a 
photographic plate as I have described above he obtained photo- 
graphs such as are shown in Plate 1, Figure 2. 

The diameter of the rings corresponds to what was foreseen by 
the fornmlae of wave mechanics. These formulae, we have seen, 
tell us the wave length associated with the electron which is smaller 
tlie greater the velocity of the electron. Therefore, if we first send 
upon the zinc oxide screen electrons having a certain velocity, we 
obtain a definite system of rings (pi. 2, fig. 1) ; if next we send 
electrons of greater speed, we obtain a similar system of rings but 
moved further in towards the center (pi. 2, fig. 2). The corre- 
spondence with the predictions of wave mechanics is quantitative 
with an accuracy of at least 1 per cent. 

The experiments of Davisson and Germer, of G. P. Thomson, of 
Ponte, and of others, have proved that the electron is not a simple 
corpuscle ; it is at the same time a corpuscle and a wave. It is doubt- 
less the same case with the proton as all recent experiments seem to 
prove. As matter seems to be formed of protons and electrons, we 
see that matter, like light, is made of corpuscles and waves. Matter 
and light thus appear to be much more similar than we had supposed 
only a very short time ago when we considered matter as being com- 
posed of corpuscles only. Undulatory mechanics has thi^s em- 
bellished and simplified our conception of Nature. Further it has 
led us to predict interference and diffraction phenomena with elec- 
trons of which 1 have just shown you the experimental proofs. One 
can say then that an iin])ortant step has thus been taken along the 
road which little by little leads the human mind to a more exact 
knowledge of the secrets of Nature.

XEW RESEARCHES OX THE EFFECT OF LIGHT WAVES 
ON THE GROWTH OF PLANTS 



By F. S. BuAcKKTr and Eakl S. Johnston 



[With 3 plates] 



Ono of the most commonly observed relationships between plants 
and light is that of phototropism, or the directional growth of plant 
organs as inliiienced by light. A potted plant, such as tiie geranium, 
[daced on the window ledge where light will fall on it from one side 
will, in a comparatively short time, turn its leaves in a position to 
receive maximum light from outside the room. The beautiful sym- 
metry of plants is veiy easily lost when they are exposed to unilat- 
eral illumination. 

Various parts or organs of plants respond differently to light. 
Young shoots and leaf petioles usually grow toward the source of 
light, while the leaves frequently set themselves at right angles to its 
beams. Occasionally there are organs which grow away from the 
source of light. Tliese three types of growth are known respectively 
as positive, transverse, and negative phototropism. One of the few 
plants which shows all three types of phototropism is the mustard 
seedling illustrated in Plate 1. A 200-watt electric lamp served as 
the light source in this particular case. The direction of the light is 
indicated by the arrow. The shoot shows positive phototropic bend- 
ing, the roots negative, and the small leaves distinctly show a 
tendency to expand at right angles to the beam of light. 

Light has a threefold eflFect on plants. The plant's response to a 
bright light is different from that to a dim light. Chlorophyll, the 
green pigment, is formed in the presence of light, but if the light is 
very intense, this coloring matter is destroyed. The number of hours 
per day that the plant is exposed to light governs to a large extent 
the nature of its growth. The very interesting and extensive experi- 
ments of Garner and AUard of the United States Department of 
Agriculture have conclusively shown that plants may be made to 
grow vegetatively, or to set flowers and fruit, merel}' by changing the 
length of time they are exposed to light. The color, or wave length 
of light, also plays an important j^art in the plant's behavior. 
Chlorophyll formation will be more raj)id in red than in blue or 
violet light. On the other hand, the short wave lengths at the violet 

255 



256 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

end of the spectrum have the greatest retardino; effect so far as the 
rate of stem elongation is concerned. Thus, plants grow and develop 
differently in accordance with the intensity of light, its duration, 
and its color. 

The three light variables just mentioned, which influence the gen- 
eral character of growth, likewise should be considered in the specific 
case of phototropism. In many of the early experiments dealing 
with the bending of plant stems toward light sources, the lights used 
were such that it was impossible to determine accurately whether it 
was the color or the intensity of the light that was causing the bend- 
ing. To be sure, both these factors of light influence this one-side 
growth response, but the relative influence of the different colors, or 
wave lengths of light, could not be determined because of the different 
intensities of the colors used. In order to determine which colors are 
most effective in phototropic bending it is necessary to use wave 
lengths of known intensity. With the object of determining in a 
quantitative way some of the fundamental growth responses of 
plants to light, the Division of Kadiation and Organisms of the 
Smithsonian Institution has initiated a series of experiments which 
will eventually clarify this problem. Before describing the methods 
used in eliminating the intensity from the wave-length effect of light 
on growth, it may be well to examine briefly the mechanics of 
phototropism. 

About 100 years ago De Candolle, the Swiss physician and botanist, 
thought that positively phototropic bending was due to the retarding 
effect of light on growth. The side of the stem most brightly 
illuminated would grow slower and bring about a bending toward 
the light source. The enormous elongation of potato sprouts in a 
darkened cellar would seem to substantiate the view that plant stems 
grow longer in the dark than in light. Thus the shaded side of the 
stem of the geranium plant growing by the side of a window will 
elongate more than the side more brightly illuminated. The result 
is obvious. The stem and the petioles bend toward the window. 
Mature plant tissues that have almost completed their growth cycle 
do not show this bending nearly so much as young tissues. Only 
the tissues that contain cells still capable of dividing or of enlarging 
are the ones concerned in this phenomenon. 

Objections were made to this early view of phototropism. Such 
distinguished men as Darwin and Pfeffer, the noted German plant 
physiologist, were led to believe that there existed a region in the 
plant capable of receiving a stimulus and that such a region was 
more or less localized. In one experiment the apex of a young sprout 
was exposed to light while the bending occurred at the base which 
was not illuminated. It thus appeared that in addition to a region of 
perception, there was a region of response. If this were true, then 



LIGHT AND PLANT GBOWTH — BRACKETT AND JOHNSTON 257 

the tissues between these two regions must be capable of conducting 
the excitation from the former place to the latter. It would appear 
on first sight that a plant is very much like an animal which, for 
example, sees food with its eyes. The excitation travels over the 
nerves to the legs which react in such a manner as to carry it toward 
the food. In a growing shoot, the tip perceives light on one side. 
The sensation is transmitted to the part lower down where differ- 
ential growth goes on in such a manner as to point the stem or shoot 
toward the light. 

A good deal of work on phototropism has been done with the 
coleoptiles of plants belonging to the grass family. The coleoptile 
is a leaf sheath surrounding the plumule or bud of the ascending shoot 
or foliage leaves. The oat is a favorite plant for such experiments. 
One ingenious experimenter as recently as 1910 hit upon tlie unicjue 
idea of cutting off the top of a coleoptile and sticking it back on the 
stub with melted gelatin. AVhen the tip was illuminated on one 
side the shoot still showed marked phototropic bending at the base. 
Did the stimulus received by the tip travel to the base after passing 
through a layer of gelatin? This experiment stimulated much 
interest and many curious methods were devised for decapitating 
the coleoptiles and replacing their " heads " in various positions. 
Further interesting experiments are reported in which the " heads " 
of coleoptiles illuminated from one side were cut off and stuck on the 
stumps of decapitated coleoptiles grown in the dark. These 
" doctored up " coleoptiles when allowed to continue their growth in 
the dark showed positively phototropic curvatures in the proper 
direction. 

Professor Priestley, of England, has recently been studying these 
very interesting plant traits and has done much toward giving this 
peculiar phenomenon a rational explanation. He shows that photo- 
tropic curvature in coleoptiles is consistent with the " light-growth " 
hypothesis in spite of many seemingly discrepant experiments. The 
amount of light required to induce phototropic curvature in normal 
light-grown shoots is greater and must be continued longer than that 
required to bring about similar curvatures in etiolated shoots. 
Etiolated shoots are those grown in the absence of light. Such 
plants are white or pale in color and usually differ from normal 
plants in the structure of their tissues. Light affects normal and 
etiolated shoots quite differently as will be shown. 

It is well to pause at this point to consider a few essential condi- 
tions for growth. The meristematic tissue consists of a group of 
actively dividing cells. An available water and food supply is 
necessary for this kind of growth. Extending up and down plant 
stems are tiny tubes through which water and solutions of food 
material pass. In order that these materials, so essential for 



258 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

growth, reach the cells located at a distance from the main trunk 
lines, it is necessary for them to pass through the walls of the inter- 
vening cells. The more permeable these walls are to water and the 
foods dissolved therein, the better are the chances for rapid growth 
of the meristematic tissues. Wilted plant cells can not grow. 
Growth ceases even when the cells just begin to wilt. Cells stop 
growing when they lose water faster than they can absorb it or when 
they can not get a sufficient amount because of a blockade in the 
line of cell Avails connecting them to the water mains (vascular 
tissue). The entire system is very delicately balanced. 

How is this sap or water system related to phototropic bending? 
As Professor Priestley states, " In this delicately balanced equilib- 
rium, strong lateral illumination may mean that the sap supply first 
fails on the side more directly lit, where evaporation will more 
rapidly bring about a state of ' incipient drying ' in the walls of the 
tissues. * * * jf i\^Q walls between the vascular supply and 
superficial meristem are in this condition, food supplies to the meris- 
tem will fail, and there will be a cessation of meristematic growth." 
Less growth will occur on the drier or more illuminated side. This 
will result in a positively phototropic bending. 

In etiolated shoots the mechanism of bending is quite different. 
Very little light will cause marked growth curvatures, whereas with 
shoots previously illuminated a stronger light is necessary. The 
walls of the cells making up the tissue in etiolated shoots contain fat 
and protein, a substance similar to egg white. These substances pre- 
vent the ready passage of sap and water from the vascular supply 
to the meristematic tissue, which, under favorable conditions, is 
capable of rapid growth. Blaauw, a Dutch scientist, points out the 
similarity between light in its photochemical effect on a photo- 
graphic plate on the one hand, and on an etiolated coleoptile on the 
other. Relatively small quantities of light produce a photochemi- 
cal action in these shoots. Protein and fatt}^ materials disappear 
from the cell walls, the latter substances migrating mainly to the 
cuticle. The passageway between the meristematic cells and their 
water and food supply is opened up. In the words of Professor 
Priestley, " Increased superficial growth now ensues. Growth as a 
whole may be as active as ever on the more brightly lit side of 
the etiolated shoot, but it is differently distributed. More cells are 
added to the surface of the stem and leaf, and less proportionately 
contributed to the inner layers of the shoot axis. The result is, 
therefore, in the aggregate, a retardation of growth in length on the 
illuminated side and a positive phototropic curvature." 

Although many roots are not sensitive to light there are a few, 
as previously mentioned, which show negative phototropism. The 
section of the root capable of bending is situated just back of the 



LIGHT AND PLANT GROWTH BRACKETT AND JOHNSTON 259 

apex or tip. In tiiis lejjion the cells are rapidly enhirjrinp by tak- 
ing in water. The water lills up a space in the cell's interior called 
the vacuole. Such vacuolating cells grow rapidly by enlarging. In 
their earlier stage, when forming the meristematic tissue, growth 
proceeded by rapiil division of the cells. Negative phototropic 
bending of these roots is attributed to the increased rapidity with 
which these vacuolating cells enlarge under the inlluence of light. 
Tiiose on the shaded side of the root enlarge less ra[)idly. 

On the basis of the above theory it may be worth while to examine 
the results obtained with decapitated coleoptiles. These organs, at 
the stage they are used in such experiments, grow entirely by cell 
enlargement and not by cell division. Light increases the rate of cell 
enlargement but the final size is less. The veins or water pipes 
running to the tip of the coleoptile, terminate in a pore. When 
the shoot becomes gorged with water this pore serves as a safety 
valve and frequently a drop of water is seen on the tip of this shoot. 
If the water pressure is decreased in the pipe line on one side, growth 
on that side is retarded. Light, by its photochemical action on the 
proteins and fats, makes the passage of water through the coleoptile 
tissue comparativeh' eas}', hence when one side is illuminated the 
flow of water through the vein in that region is facilitated, thereby 
reducing the turgor or water pressure. This in turn retards growth 
on the brighter illuminated side. On the less lighted side growth 
is faster. This causes the shoot to bend toward the light. By cut- 
ting off the tip, water is freely lost and growth retarded. Now if 
half the stub is covered so that the veins in that region are blocked, 
bending due to increased rate of growth will occur even in darkness 
in such a manner that the blocked veins are on the convex side of 
the curved shoot. It seems a likely hypothesis that the mechanics 
of phototropism is a light-growth reaction based to a large extent 
on the relation of growth to available water and food supply. 

There is little doubt but that the wave length, or color of light, 
is an important factor to be considered in a study dealing with funda- 
mental problems of plant growth. Since it appears that photo- 
tropism is a specific case of light-growth reactions, it is believed that 
some of the underlying principles relating to the growth of organ- 
isms, especially plants, can be worked out from accurately controlled 
experiments dealing with phototropic responses of etiolated shoots. 
Such shoots are extremely sensitive to light of relatively low in- 
tensity and short exposure. Before the wave-length effects of light 
can be determined accurately, it is, of course, necessary to eliminate 
all intensity eifects. This phase of light and growth is one of the 
problems being investigated in the laboratories of the Smithsonian 
Institution. 



260 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

For this purpose a wooden light-proof box, 7 feet 10 inches long 
and 12 inches wide, was built. This box was divided into five com- 
partments or separate chambers. The two end compartments con- 
taining the light sources were approximately 27 inches high, or 5 
inches higher than the other three. The central, or plant compart- 
ment, was 2 feet 10 inches long. Between the central and the end 
chambers were partitioned off two small (*bmpartments containing 
ray filters and the water and air cooling devices. This apparatus, 
the plant photometer, is illustrated in Plate 2. 

Briefly, the method of carrying out this experiment is to place, for 
example, a yellow ray filter in one end of the central or plant cham- 
ber and a green one in the other end. The intensities of the lights 
coming from the lamps in the end chambers were so adjusted that they 
register the same intensity on a delicate thermocouple placed at the 
center of the plant compartment. After the proper adjustment had 
been made the light measuring apparatus was removed, as illustrated 
in the picture, and the seedling of an oat plant placed in the chamber. 
The seedling was placed in a vertical position and surrounded by a 
rotating double-walled glass cylinder. This cylinder, rotating slowly 
around the seedling, insures equal temperature and moisture condi- 
tions in the immediate vicinity of the plant. This precaution is 
necessary since slight differences of temperature or moisture will 
cause unequal growth in the side of the stem and bring about a 
curvature. 

After the seedling has been properly adjusted between the yellow 
and green lights of equal intensity the box is closed and the plant 
permitted to grow from two to four hours. When the plant was 
examined in this particular experiment, it had grown toward the 
green light somewhat in the manner of the seedling illustrated in 
Plate 3. Thus, of the two colors of equal intensity used in this 
experiment the green was more effective in retarding growth, as 
was evident from the plant's bending toward that light. 

In order to evaluate the effect of one color in terms of another, 
other experiments were carried out after changing the relative in- 
tensities of the two lights. Intensities were finally reached at which 
the plant grew without bending toward either light. The intensities 
were then measured, and it was found that the yellow light was 
approximately 1,000 times as intense as the green at the balancing 
point. The light passing through the blue ray-filter used in these 
preliminary experiments exerted a greater growth-inhibiting influ- 
ence than either the yellow or green lights, the factor being 30 when 
compared with green or 30,000 when compared with yellow, assuming 
a linear intensity effect. We see, therefore, that the effect becomes 
much more jDronounced as we shorten the wave length. 

In order to more completely describe this increase of phototropic 
effect with decrease in wave length, that is, in passing from red to 



LIGHT AND PLANT GROWTH BRACKETT AND JOHNSTON 261 

yellow, yellow to green, and green to blue, it is desirable to expose 
the plant to a narrower wave-length band. If we look at white light 
as it is spread out into the spectrum by a prism, we see that the red 
changes gradually into yellow, the yellow into green, and green 
into blue, and that an indefinite number of difl'eront ])ure colors 
actually exists. By using an instrument called a monoclirometer, it 
is possible to select a more definite shade of yellow or green, and 
instead of using just three wide color bands, we could divide the 
spectrum into oO or lOO purer colors or bands, of more restricted 
wave-length range. If we plot, then, the intensity of each shade 
required to balance the phototro})ic influence of a given standard 
lamp against the wave length, we can obtain a group of 50 or 100 
points instead of the three obtained in the preliminary experiment. 
The equipment for this more elaborate undertaking is under 
construction. 

In the general study of the very complicated phenomena of plant 
growth, light enters as an important factor in many ways. Supply- 
ing, as it does, the necessary energy for the process of converting 
carbon dioxide into sugars and starches, its relation to this process, 
termed photosynthesis, is one of greatest interest. As the energ}' 
which we derive from our food was originally stored up by this 
process of photosynthesis, an understanding of the process is of 
the greatest importance to our existence. Experiments are being 
imdertaken, designed to study the ell'ect of different colors of light 
upon plant growth, together with observations as to the amount 
of carbon dioxide utilized under rigidly controlled conditions. In 
these experiments nutrient solutions instead of soil are used because 
of their reproducibility. Lights similar to Neon signs, but yielding 
more nearly a single wave length, replace the usual sunlight. It is 
hoped that these experiments will throv,- some light upon the little 
understood process of photosynthesis. 

Among the difficulties which face the experimenter in studying 
these phenomena is the fact that he does not know the construction of 
the very complicated molecules which are present in living tissue. 
Chemical analysis yields information as to the elements which make 
up tliese complicated molecules, but the usual methods of observation 
do not offer enough data for determining the position of the various 
atoms, or the forces which hold them together. Study of the light 
which such molecules emit or absorb offers a wealth of new data 
which may serve as a key to a more complete understanding of those 
molecules which are of pivotal importance. In order to understand 
how such information can be gained, it may be well to make some 
simple comparisons. When we hear a sound we are immediately 
able to say that the source of the sound is a bird, a whistle, or a horn, 
as the case may be. We do so by associating the characteristic 
28005—31 18 



262 ANNUAL, EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

pitches, frequencies or wave lengths of the sound with the source. In 
the same way, the frequencies or wave lengths of light emitted or 
absorbed by a molecule are characteristic of the molecule, and are 
determined by its construction. To get the most information about 
the characteristics of the sound and relate these characteristics to the 
construction of the source of the sound, the ear is inadequate, and an 
apparatus must be provided for determining just what frequencies or 
wave lengths are present. So in the study of light we must have a 
machine which will distinguish between the different wave lengths, 
or colors, in a more quantitative fashion than the eye is capable of 
doing. Such an instrument is known as a spectrometer. Looking 
into a spectrometer we see the light spread out into its constituent 
colors, the red on the left and the blue on the extreme right, with all 
the intermediate wave lengths or colors arranged between them in an 
orderly fashion. Unfortunately, the light which gives the most 
information in regard to these large complicated molecules is of too 
long wave lengths to be seen by the eye. It is necessary, therefore, 
to substitute for the eye a very sensitive electrical thermometer. By 
turning a single dial successively different wave lengths are caused to 
fall upon this sensitive thermometer, which by its change in tempera- 
ture, records the amount of each wave length present. 

A spectrometer is very similar in its analysis of light to a radio 
receiving set in its analysis of the electrical oscillations which it 
picks up. As one turns the dial slowly, the instrument responds 
first, say, to 200 meters, then to 201, 202, and so on to the other ex- 
treme of its range, say, 800 meters. If a station is broadcasting on 
a wave length of 304 meters, as one comes to the dial number 302 
he begins to hear it. It comes in strongly at 304, and fades out at 
306. The range over which it may be picked up on the dial is asso- 
ciated with the selectivity of the set. In the same way a spectro- 
meter responds to the different wave lengths of light. If a single 
strong wave length is being " broadcast " by a mercury arc, and that 
wave length is 1/x, or one-millionth of a meter, the spectrometer will 
pick it up weakly at a dial reading a little less than Ifi, show a 
maximum response at 1/x, and as one continues to turn it, gradually 
lose it as 1/a is passed. The range over which it responds depends 
upon its selectivity, or resolving power. As a matter of fact, the 
mercury arc broadcasts not simply on one wave length, but on sev- 
eral, so that as one turns the dial, he picks it up at several different 
points. The accompanying illustration. Figure 1, shows the differ- 
ent wave lengths of radiation received from a mercury arc. The 
widths of the bases of these peaks depend upon the selectivity, while 
the heights indicate the intensity or strength of the signal. If the 
selectivity were less the bases would be broader, and the signals of 
very nearly the same wave length would be confused and not ob- 
served as a separate effects, just as in a poor radio one gets several

the intensities of ratliation of dillerent wave len<,'ths ui)on a moving 
photographic plate is a part of the program. One such instrument 
to he used in the ran<i:e of wave lengths between l/i and 2.5/i or 
between 1 and 25 millionths of a meter is already completed and in 
operation. Otiier machines to operate in the region between 2/i and 
15/1 are under construction.

Molecules not only emit frequencies which are characteristic of 
them, but also when light is passed through them, absorb through 
resonance the same frequencies. Often it is more convenient to study 
their absorption than their emission. Thus light may be taken 
from an ordinary tungsten Mazda bulb, passed through a liquid, 
the structure of whose molecules is to be studied, and analyzed to 
see what frequencies have been weakened. The top curve of Figure 
2 shows the light from a Mazda bulb passed through 1 cm. of carbon

tetrachloride. As carbon tetrachloride is practically transparent in 
this region, all frequencies of the range are present in considerable 
strength. The second curve shows the effect of adding 0.127 grams 
of paradichlorbenzene. Here it will be noticed that frequencies in 
the region of 1.13/i, and 1.66ju, are much weaker, those being the char- 
acteristic frequencies absorbed by the paradichlorbenzene. The other 
curves show successively greater concentrations of paradichlorbenzene. 
It will be noticed that the weaker absorption frequencies are more 
clearly evident in the greater concentrations. By comparing the 
characteristic frequencies absorbed in paradichlorbenzene with other 
halogen derivitives of benzene, important information can be gained 
in regard to the structure of these interesting molecules. This 
type of study will eventually be extended to molecules which are of 
importance in the biological processes. 

While it is possible, through direct observation of complicated 
living organisms, to accumulate a vast amount of valuable informa-

tion, complete understanding of the processes which are involved 
is impossible without a knowledge of the structure and characteristics 
of the molecules entering into these processes. Most of the molecules, 
such as those of chlorophyll, the various proteins, and enzymes, are so 
complicated as to render it impossible to gain even the customary 
chemical knowledge derived from analysis and synthesis. Keal un- 
derstanding requires not only this information, but a knowledge of 
other phj'^sical characteristics which determine the nature of their 
chemical reactions and their responses to various wave lengths of 
light. The most logical hope of progress in studying these very com- 
plicated molecules is to bring to bear those methods which yield the 
greatest amount of independent data. The type of investigation 
just described is one of the most promising approaches which has 
offered itself. Thus these types of research which, at first glance 
seem remote from biology, should, in the long run, prove of the 
greatest value in gaining a fundamental understanding of these 
biological processes which are of such vital importance.

THE AUTOGIRO: ITS CHARACTERISTICS AND 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS ' 



By Habold F. Pitcaibn 
President, Pitcnirn-Cierva Autoijiro Company of America, 



[With 9 plates] 



To reach a correct understanding of the Autogiro and the prin- 
ciples which underlie its performance, I feel that it will first be 
necessary to tell something of the man who has invented the most 
remarkable aircraft known up to this time. 

Senor Juan de la Cierva is a Spanish gentleman of great per- 
sonal charm and brilliance. In his own land he is a person of 
real consequence. On the technical side, his genius undoubtedly 
places him among the world's foremost mathematicians. 

His democratic manner, kindliness, and tirelessness in his work 
have brought him the respect of all with whom he has come into 
contact, and although he has received some of the highest of the 
world's honors, he is among the plainest of men in his ways. He 
is a tremendous worker; the present degree of perfection to which 
he has attained in the Autogiro is due, almost in entirety, to his 
efforts alone. Ho had faith in the principle which he first brought 
forth, and in the face of many disappointments, due to machines 
which refused to leave the ground, he persevered in his efforts until 
the Autogiro has finally proven practical and safe. 

In his boyhood, Cierva, with two friends of his own age, built 
and flew kites and gliders. Progressing further, they built, or 
rather rebuilt, a power plane which flew more successfully than 
when new. In 1912 a French pilot brought a French biplane to 
Madrid for exhibition flights. People then were not as accustomed 
to airplanes as they are now, and when this pilot landed the crowd 
rushed in upon him, with the result that there was a serious acci- 
dent. The machine was completely wrecked, although the pilot 
himself was unhurt. 

Later, Cierva and his young friends approached the pilot with 
the novel offer that they would rebuild the plane if he would test

fly it. Thinking it more a joke than anything else, the pilot ac- 
cepted. There was practically nothing salvageable about the 
machine excepting the motor and the wheels. With these as a basis, 
the boys set energetically to work. 

The carpentry shop of one of their fathers was open to them and, 
doing all the intricate work of fitting bits of wood and stretching 
canvas, they turned out a machine which flew decidedly better than 
the original. This machine was the first in Spain. 

Later on, in 1913, they started to build a racing plane. In this 
they had at first the support of their people, who were encouraged 
to help them because of their initial success. However, in striving 
after speed, the boys gave their monoplane so little surface that it 
could scarcely get off the ground. After several minor taxying 
accidents in which undercarriages gave way, their parents' confi- 
dence waned and the boys were compelled to give up the project. 

All this amateur experimentation had given Cierva the feel of the 
air and the conviction that his future career lay in aeronautics. 
Upon his return to school at that time, which was about at the be- 
ginning of the World War, he elected to take an eight years' course 
covering civil and mechanical engineering, since that was the nearest 
approach to an aerodynamic engineering course available. At that 
time there were no schools of aerodynamics in Spain. During his 
school career he always stood well near the head of his class. 

I wish to emphasize that it was Cierva's thorough grounding in 
engineering and mathematics which enabled him to work out in 
theory alone the invention of the Autogiro. It was the result of 
tireless effort and endless patience, and was achieved along logical, 
constructive lines. The invention was not a haphazard one. 

Toward the close of the World War, the Spanish government an- 
nounced a competition for the design of three types of military 
planes. These were pursuit, reconnaisance, and bomber. In a sport- 
ing spirit, Cierva entered the design competition for the bomber, and 
produced a plane which in many respects was years ahead of its time. 
Wlien he designed it, the warring countries still withheld all informa- 
tion on design, so that the machine could truly be called his own. 
It was a 3-motored tractor biplane, with a wing span of around 100 
feet. At that time there were no other 3-engined machines excepting 
the Caproni, and that was not of the modern tractor type. 

The machine proved entirely successful. Cierva's test pilot, dis- 
tinctly scared by its great size, treated it with great gentleness at 
first, but as he found it responsive and maneuverable, his fears dimin- 
ished and overconfidence set in, with the result that he flew it in a 
way that no big machine could be handled, and while flying near 
the ground, stalled and crashed. He was only bruised, but the ma- 
chine was demolished. 



THE AUTOQIRO PITCAIRN 267 

The accident caused Ciervii to review the entire progress of 
mechanical fliglit. He reasoned that if a proven, ellicient airphme 
couhl be crashed so easily by a seasoned pilot's Hying it slowly near 
the ground, there was something fundamentally wrong with the 
airplane. He canvassed the entire field of flight by heavier-than-air 
craft in the search for a fundamentally safe Hying machine. Finally, 
after continuous research in theory and practice, he struck upon the 
idea of autogiration. 

While there are nnvny ft)rms of autogiration, but one seemed prac- 
tical to the great inventor. This was the result of extraordinarily 
sound and inspii-ed engineering tleveloped from higher mathematics. 
The Autogiro would have been impossible without the preliminary 
development of the correct theory. 

On his first machine he used two 4-blade rotors. One of these was 
placed above the other, with the two rotating in opposite directions. 
He had realized that the lift on the blades while traveling with the 
flight path would be much greater than while going against it, and 
the idea of the two rotors with opposite directional rotation was 
calculated to cancel out the tendency to tip over. He found that the 
upper rotor turned much the faster, however, and the tendency to 
tip over was so strong that no real attempt was made to take it off 
the ground. This was Cierva's only attempt to use two rotors on 
the same machine. 

His confidence was undiminished, and he set to work on the second 
type. It should be mentioned here that, although probably in excess 
of 50 or GO Autogiros have been constructed, there have been only 
6 or 8 general types, and that many models were simply slight modi- 
fications of their predecessors. The rotor of the second type em- 
ployed three rigid cantilever blades. He attempted to compensate 
for the difference in lift between the blades while advancing and 
while receding by a mechanism which changed the angle of incidence 
of each as it revolved, giving the greater angle on the receding blade. 
This mechanism proved cumbersome and substantially ineffective. 

On the third general type, which like the others was constructed 
around an airplane fuselage, he used five blades, and — it flew. The 
tendency to tip over was corrected with ailerons. Althougli it flew 
but a few feet, he told me that no other machine has ever given him 
the thrill that he experienced when this proved that an Autogiro 
could be flown. The machine of course had many deficiencies, chief 
among which was that of the strong gyroscopic force set up by tlie 
rotation of the large rigid rotor. The gyroscopic force was so strong 
that the controls of the machine had to be greatly modified. 

Encouraged by its flight success, however, he built a model which 
embodied one of the main principles essential to a successful Auto- 
giro. In this he constructed the spars of the blades with rattan. 



268 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

which in itself is quite flexible. This flexibility took the place of the 
articulation which was the secret of success in later full-sized 
machines. Also, in a small model rough action would be unnoticed, 
since there is a very great difference between observing the perform- 
ance of a model, and actually being in a machine yourself. This 
model flew remarkably well and encouraged him to proceed with 
further experiments. 

It was the next machine, employing hinged joints at the attach- 
ment of the blades to the rotor hub, which proved really successful. 
The construction permitted the blades to flap upward and downward 
during rotation, so that each vane automatically took the correct 
effective angle of incidence at all times. For the first time, the 
problem of gyroscopic force, which is a very powerful influence to 
work against, was nullified. 

Besides the immediate and great improvement in the performance 
of the rotor, this articulation solved a number of other besetting 
problems. It made autogiration possible at angles of attack where 
otherwise the rotation of the rotor would discontinue. In wind 
tunnel tests which Cierva conducted in Spain it was found that the 
rotor would continue to turn at every angle. This however would 
not be so if the blades were rigidly attached to the rotor hub. 

Secondary articulation, permitting variation of the position of 
the blades with regard to one another along the circle which they 
describe, was another important step. This gave smooth action to 
the rotor, which before was rough. Further success came with the 
addition of the fixed wing, which improves efficiency in the present 
state of the art of the Autogiro. Before that time, Cierva had 
utilized ailerons on outriggers, as it had been found necessary to 
have some type of lateral control, although he had flown the 
machines with neither fixed wings nor ailerons. 

Another improvement in eificiency came with the use of the geared 
motor. The gears in this case refer only to reduction of propeller 
speed since the rotor depends entirely on the action of the air 
during flight. A large slow turning propeller gives much greater 
efficiency at slow forward speeds than a smaller one turning at 
engine speed. The geared propeller therefore increases greatly the 
efficiency of the Autogiro since its best angle of climb is at a much 
slower forward speed than the airplane. 

A step toward making the Autogiro practical is the self-starting 
tail invented during the past year by Cierva. This is a boxlike bi- 
plane structure by which the slipstream can be diverted upward 
while the machine is at rest on the ground, thus bringing the rotor 
to the necessary speed for take-off. Before the introduction of this 
feature, it had been necessary to taxi slowly for some time about the 
field until this rotational speed was attained. 



THE AUTOQIRO PITCAIRN 269 

The Autogiro presents certain new problems with the undercar- 
riage because of its ability to land vertically. Although the vertical 
speed of descent in late models has been as low as 12 feet per second, 
the condition of landing straight down requires longer travel of the 
undercarriage with more sliock absorption than in the airplane. A 
satisfactory arrangement is an oleo-pneumatic strut of very long 
travel combined with the Goodyear air wheel. 

The stability of any flying machine is a matter of importance. At 
slow speeds and particularly during vertical descent the Autogiro 
is inherently and perfectly stable. This is because the center of 
gravity is well behnv the rotor. The center of gravity is also slightly 
ahead of the center of support. This provides longitudinal control 
during vertical descent and gives the machine a marked tendency to 
glide forward when the power is cut-olf. This insures directional 
control and stability. Very slight forward speed is required for 
lateral control and in vertical descent stability is so great that no 
control is necessary even in rough weather. In fast forward speed 
control and stability are similar to the airplane. 

In point of performance, the Autogiro offers some distinctly novel 
experiences to the pilot accustomed to fixed-wing craft. There is 
something fairly exciting about doing things which he has been 
instructed to avoid at peril of accident. Such, for instance, as stop- 
ping in the air, descending vertically, or even flying backward. 

When stopping or descending vertically the sensation, for an air- 
plane pilot, is uncanny to say the least. He has been taught since his 
earliest flying days not to lose his flying speed, but in the Autogiro 
this results in nothing more than slow vertical descent. And then 
if there is some wind and the machine is facing against it, the pilot 
will have the outrageous sensation of flying backwards in relation to 
the earth. 

Slow speed flying at low altitude is a most pleasant diversion, but it 
is a sport attended in the airplane with great danger. In the 
Autogiro, on the other hand, one can fly low and slowly at will, 
observing at leisure the interesting features of the country. On 
account of the slow speed he is able to turn to one side or the other 
very quickly to avoid objects looming in his path; so in thick weather 
he can grope his vfny along at lower altitude than the airplane and 
also, on account of his slow speed, has time to see obstacles before 
hitting them. If the engine stops he can get down into very small 
spaces. 

Improvement in the Autogiro must be in the nature of evolution, 
much as it came about in the airplane. To take a good exam[)le, our 
first Mail wing plane, built about three years ago, had a high speed 
of around 125 miles per iiour with 225 horsepower. Constant refine- 
ment has increased this to 145 miles per hour. With N. A. C. A. cowl- 



270 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

ing this has been further increased to 160 miles per hour, yet with 
the same horsepower. We expect the Autogiro we have just finished 
to do about 120 miles per hour with the 225 horsepower, only 5 miles 
less than the first Mailwing, and if we compare this machine with 
the first Mailwing it will be readily apparent that there is much 
more opportunity for reducing drag in the Autogiro than in the case 
of the early Mailwing. 

The Autogiro is much more susceptible and sensitive to improve- 
ment than is the airplane, and responds in greater degree. For in- 
stance, when we recently completed one of the first American ma- 
chines, its initial flight test showed a high speed of 87 miles per hour. 
When the pilot landed and reported the disappointing 87 miles-per- 
hour speed, there were long faces to be seen everywhere. 

Senor Cierva held his peace, but when he went to work on his 
figures that day he checked up everything and told me that 87 miles 
per hour was correct because of the detail arrangements; and that 
we would make a few changes in the machine and it would do 105. 
After these changes were made the next day, the machine did 105, 
much, I believe, to the surprise of the pilots and aeronautical experts 
who were present. Later, with other modifications, it definitely is 
expected to show around 120. 

The Autogiro has many more parameters than the airplane. In 
their sum total and in their relationships to each other and to other 
combinations, they present an almost infinite variety of viewpoints, 
by means of which, through evolution and selection, engineers can 
improve the Autogiro. For instance, in the airplane we have wing 
area. In the Autogiro we have blade area, disk area, fixed wing 
area, and the relation of the various areas. In the airplane we have 
aspect ratio, or the relation of wing span to chord. In the Auto- 
giro we have solidity, or the relation of blade area to disk area. In 
the airplane we have the wing curve, while in the Autogiro we 
have the curve of the fixed wing, curve of the rotor blades, and its 
constantly changing effective curve, caused by its differing attack 
as it rotates. In the airplane, we have angle of incidence. In the 
Autogiro, we have the speed with which the air strikes the rotor 
blades, which is constantly changing on account of the relation 
between forward and rotational speed. Then, of course, there is 
the all-important matter of good proportion of the above items. 
Small improvements to parasitic drag, power loading, and disk 
loading result in relatively large advances in performances. 

If an airplane, by streamlining or refining some of its parts, 
increases it speed, say, 10 miles per hour, the same degree of 
refining will increase the Autogiro's speed about 15 miles per hour. 

Finally, we are very fortunate in that, unlike the airplane, im- 
provement to one phase of the Autogiro's performance helps the 



THE AUTOQIRO PITCAIRN 271 

other phases. For instance, modifying the rotor for higher for- 
ward speed may be so handled as to decrease rate of vertical descent. 

Without the theoiy worked out and developed by Cierva, all this 
would be impossible, liecently he has put this theory into written 
form for the use of engineers. He has also developed a series of 
graphs with accompanying explanation which will enable the engi- 
neer to calculate performance and design Autogiros of various sizes 
and types. This theoretical work alone would in itself be a monu- 
mental achievement for many a lesser engineer. 

80 far, as I have said, the Autogiro is the work of one man only. 
Think what the Autogiro will be when the same effort is put on it 
that has been applied to the airplane. Also, the engineers now con- 
centrating upon the Autogiro have many more factors with which 
to deal than those who took the airplane in hand, and they have 
extensive knowledge of aerodynamics to work with, gained from 
wind-tunnel tests and airplane experience. 

In conclusion, I may say that the Autogiro is now a practical 
machine, and within a reasonable time many will be produced com- 
mercially. The Autogiro is free from many of the inherent limita- 
tions of the tixed-wing aircraft, and while its performance is even 
now superior to the airplane in many respects, all considerations of 
performance are subordinated to the one feature which it affords 
in large measure: that feature is safety.

TEN YEARS' GLIDING AND SOARING IN GERMANY ^ 



By I'BOF. De. Wai.tts Geoeoii 
Darmstadt, (icrmany 



[With 10 plates] 



We are looking back on 10 years of development and on an un- 
broken series of 10 gliding competitions held at the Wasserkuppe 
in the Rhoen, since 1920. The organization has not only maintained 
its range of activities all these years but has largely extended it, and 
in this way has given the best proof of its vitality and purpose. In 
the first decade, now completed, successes have been achieved such 
as few foresaw, and the cause may be sought in the spirit of close 
cooperation with which the sportsman strove to avail himself of 
the flying possibilities opened up by the scientist. 

This union of sport and science is in the true traditions of German 
gliding since its revival in 1920. At Frankfurt in that year, Oskar 
Ursinus directed the air-minded members of the younger generation 
toward gliding as a substitute for power flight of which they were 
perforce deprived ; but he had the progress of aeronautical science 
at least as nmch at heart as the interest of the sport. He desired to 
direct aeronautical investigation along a new path, and to free it 
from the restricted view that progress was bound up with power 
flight. "Were it possible to develop gliders carrying appreciable 
loads, they woidd serve as prototypes for light airplanes, without 
losing sight of more general sporting possibilities. The evolution 
of the light sporting airplane from the glider was his technical 
objective. His sporting aim was to offer keen youngsters a chance 
of flying at no great financial outlay by giving their time freely to 
constructing gliders. In the course of their purely sporting activi- 
ties they would develop a sound team spirit and would find a stimulus 
to technical and scientific work. 

On his initiative the first gliding coni])etition at the Wnsserlnippe 
in the Rhoen was held in August, 1920. In spite of initial difriculties 
a new gliding record of 2 minutes 22 seconds, and of 1,830 meters, 
was made by W. Klemperer, whose design (pi. 1, fig. 1) first

settled the type of construction suitable for gliders. It was a canti- 
lever low-wing monoplane, in which great care was given to keep 
down drag with its adverse effect on performance. 

In the following year the same principle of keeping down body 
drag was more fully applied by G. Madelung to his glider Vampyr^ 
the design of which has had a lasting influence. The Vampyr type 
prevails at the present time, and this is a measure of Madelung's 
contribution to glider design. 

Since gliding flight depends on the use of slowly rising currents 
in the air, a practicable glider is chiefly characterized by a small 
vertical component of velocity, or sinking speed. A small rate of 
descent may be obtained either by reducing the sum of the resistances 
or by reducing the wing loading. These two methods have been 
applied, and lead to two special types of glider, both of which 
find application for special purposes. A large span and good aspect 
ratio are favorable to a small (induced) drag, and further reduc- 
tion of drag is gained by a closed body, cantilever contruction (no 
external bracing) and by dropping the starting carriage. 

From the Vampyr^ the prototype of German high-performance 
gliders, onwards, all these methods of reducing drag have been 
carefully studied and carried out, so that further fundamental im- 
provements are scarcely to be expected. The following photographs 
show the best-known German high-performance gliders from the 
Vampyr of 1921 to the Wien of 1929 : 

Vampijr^ Academical Flying Club of Hanover, 1*921 (pi. 1, fig. 2) ; 
Consul, Academical Flying Club of Darmstadt, 1923 (pi. 2, fig. 2) ; 
Miinchen, Academical Flying Club of Munich, 1928 (pi. 3, fig, 1) ; 
Wien, R. Kronfeld. Built by A. Lippisch, 1929 (pi. 3, fig. 2.). 

On the Wien, Kronfeld carried out his great duration flights, 
covering distances up to 150 km. 

In designing for low head drag the structural weight is in- 
creased to a restricted degree, and the structural methods, illustrated 
above, produce medium heavy gliders with a margin of strength for 
high performance and for flying in gusty weather. The additional 
weight gives the greater air speed required for progress against 
strong winds and for passing rapidly through unfavorable belts of 
down wind. The glider of low drag and considerable structural 
weight is the best all round for long cross-country glides by virtue of 
its slow descent and high air speed. 

Another method of reducing the sinking speed, by reducing the 
wing loading, is widely applied to glider design but quite unsuit- 
able for high performance. It produces a very special type with 
low air speed, poor gliding angle, light structural weight, and simple 
form. 



GLIDING IN GERMANY — GEORGH 275 

The Djalvar Anamm/i ("Devil take it") is of this type and its 
main characteristics are: Braced monoplane wings, simple gjirder, 
tail hook, and boat-shaped cockjiit below the winn:s. Plate 3, 
Figure 3, shows a standard glider of this type. 

It has a good duration performance in light winds but a restricted 
range on account of its slow air speed. In the school type the 
aerodynamical (jualities are sacrificed to more robust construction, 
simplified for ease of repair; the cockpit is not covered so that the 
pilot may fall clear in a smash, and restricted gliding and soaring 
powers are desirable for training purposes. The best known of this 
derived type is the ZoegUng, shown in Plate 4, Figure 1. 

Once the princii)los of successful soaring were recognized, results 
soon followed. In V^i^l^ Hentzen and Martens, both students, car- 
lied out the first soaring flights, lasting over an hour, on the Vampyr. 
Ilentzen's record flight of 3 hovirs 10 minutes, attaining an altitude of 
3."»0 m., made the activities at the AVasserkuppe world famous. 

It elucidated the problem of soaring flight by using the energy in 
the air's motion. In accordance with the laws of motion soaring is 
possible in an ascending current of air, and in a horizontal air 
current of variable velocity. 

When the rate of ascent of the air current equals or exceeds the 
rate of descent of the glider, " static soaring " is possible. When 
the horizontal wind is variable, the pilot gains height as the velocity 
increases and loses height as the velocity decreases. As the air forces 
are proportional to the .square of the air speed, it is possible in prin- 
ciple to obtain a net gain. If the net rate of gain equals or exceeds 
the sinking speed, this " dynamic flight " becomes possible. It is 
quite probable that some dynamic gain was obtained in the earlier 
flights, but not by any systematic use of the wind fluctuations. 

The extensive efforts made from 1921 to 1923 to connect pulsating 
dynamical effects with the performance of man-carrying gliders did 
more harm than good to the development and reputation of soaring, 
the possibilities of which, apart from any such effects, have been 
fully shown by the subsequent years. 

To revert to static soaring, local rising currents are produced by 
every irregularity of the earth's surface — knolls, dunes, woods, the 
waves of the sea — and may be utilized for soaring flight. The 
following photograplis show well-known soaring grounds: 

The Wasserkuppe in the Rhoen (pi. 5, figs. 1, 2) ; the French soar- 
ing grounds at Vauville (pi. G, fig. 1) ; and the soaring grounds at 
Rossitten on the Kurisch Lagoon (at the mouth of the Memel in 
East Prussia) (pi. 4, fig. 2).

It is seen that the records at the Wasserkuppe have dropped far 
behind those at Eossitten. Such flights are a useful stimulus to 
the sport but do not much help further developments of soaring. 
For this reason cross-country flights have been preferred at the 
Wasserkuppe as eminently serviceable for research work, and by 
this means alone new regions of favorable rising winds have been 
delimited, and the practice of soaring has been made less dependent 
on time and place. The performance has been steadily improved and 
a high aeronautical and scientific standard of instruction in the 
methods of soaring has been attained. The following table shows

The technique of cross-country soaring flights is best shown by 
plotting the course on a counter map, with barogram readings of 
the heights attained, and other information supplied by the pilot. 
Plates 8 and 7 show the masterly flights of Nehring and Hirth, 
from the starting point round a fixed mark and back. Soaring 
flight by Nehring round the Heidelstein on the Darmstadt, August, 
1927, is shown in Plate 8, Figure 1 ; soaring flight by Hirth round 
the Schweinsberg on the Lore, July, 1929, is shown in Plate 7, 
Figure 1. 

In the flight round the Heidelstein, Nehring first soared over the 
south slope of the Wasserkuppe until he had gained 150 m. height 
above the starting point. He then flew parallel to the ridge and at 
right angles to the prevailing wind to Miinzkopf, where he used 
the strong upcurrent to reach his maximum height at 260 m., which 
was sufficient to reach the Heidelstein and return to the starting 
point.

Hirth's flight was more difficult and more instructive. He started 
from the west slope of the Wasserkuppe, and maintained himself 
there until he had painod 400 m. in height, and then carried out 
his cross-country flight to the immediate neighborhood of the 
Schweinsberg without serious difficulty. On the return flight he 
fomid that he had lost height badly and was 200 m. below the start- 
ing point. lie was twice forced to turn back and soar over valleys 
with upwinds in order to regain sufficient height to regain the west- 
ern slope, over which he cruised until he was high enough to land 
(m the plateau of the Wasserkuppe at the prescribed point. 

In tiiis admirable exhibition of the methods of cross-country work, 
it is seen that tlie pilot leaves the original region and seeks new 
areas of rising wind, leaving nothing to chance, but laying his course 
beforehand, according to the wind prevailing and to the lay of the 
land. It is characteristic of such flights that the best course is not 
in general the shortest distance, but may involve long detours in 
reaching upwind areas, and lengthy soaring over a particular point 
in gaining sufficient height. Briefly, the pilot must fly on sound 
topographical and meteorological information, if he is to reach his 
goal. Cross-country flights will be achieved over wide regions by 
flying from slope to slope, from hill to hill, and finally, from range 
to range. The satisfaction of skillfully adapting soaring flight to 
the configuration of wind currents and landscape is enhanced, if 
need be. by the sporting excitement and by the real value to flying. 

Xehring's 1927 flight is another instructive example of cross- 
country work in which a whole range was traversed by passing from 
hill to hill. There was no straightforward continuous region of 
upwinds available. Local areas of rising wind had to be sought 
out on slopes facing the general direction of the wind, and wide 
belts of downwind lying between them had to be crossed. The 
masterly fashion in which Nehring carried out these successive stages 
is shown on Plate 8. 

A barognim of Xehring's 53 km. flight to Berka, August, 1927, is 
shown in Plate 9, Figures 1, 2, and a plan and height contour of 
the same flight in Plate 10, Figure 1. 

The ups and downs of tlie barogram correspond to the up- and 
downwind regions which were met. The plan of the course shows 
very well the flying tactics adopted in circling over hills which pro- 
duced rising winds, long enough to gain extra height for the next 
stage of the flight. 

Kronfeld's 100 kra. flight in spring, 1929, over the Teutoburger- 
wald was acliieved by these same tactics, and supports the view tliat 
a sound knowledge of the flow oi the wind round iiill ranges, liills, 
knolls, and dunes enables a soaring pilot, competent in his art, to 
achieve remarkable cross-country performances, over hill and dale.

278 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

We can not remain content to restrict soaring to hilly country but 
must strive to bring within its scope the regions of the air above 
flat lands. The sailing flight of birds, indeed, shows that upwinds 
exist over plains, and are probably adaptable to soaring man flight. 

Research on soaring was initiated just at the beginning of the 
serious crisis of 1924 and 1925. Soaring gliders had not been involved 
in the restrictions imposed on power aircraft, but were adversely 
affected by the revival of interest in the sporting possibilities left 
open to light airplanes, when the worst restrictions were removed. 

After the record duration soaring flights of 1922, England, 
France, Italy, and Russia had held soaring competitions, but interest 
had soon passed back to the light airplane. Even in Germany soar- 
ing came to be regarded as a mere makeshift for power gliding. Only 
when this erroneous view had been disproved, and soaring shown to 
have its own individual scope, did the crisis pass. 

The Rhoen Rossitten Gesellschaft was founded in these difficult 
times, with the purpose of supporting gliding schools, of holding com- 
petitions to give publicity, of improving performance, and of stimu- 
lating gliding activities generally. A special research department 
was established at the Wasserkuppe for advancing technical and 
scientific knoAvledge of the problems involved, and the management 
was placed in the hands of the writer in 1926. 

The Rhoen Rossitten Gesellschaft may be regarded as the center 
of the gliding movement in Germany and in other countries. Teams 
were sent to the meetings in the Crimea at Asiago and at Vauville. 
Instructors were sent to the United States on the formation of the 
American gliding school at Cape Cod, A French educational com- 
mission has received full training, and this has stimulated the sport 
in France. Technical advice has been given to Hungary, Holland, 
and Belgium. In these ways the society has made its contribution 
to the common problem of soaring flight to which in turn all other 
nations can contribute their activities. Since 1926, having overcome 
the crisis of 1924-25, the practice of soaring and gliding has made 
vigorous and continuous progress. Glider schools have been estab- 
lished, and standard gliders have been distributed along with work- 
ing drawings and instructions for building them. These include the 
Zoegling, Priifling, and Professor types. The number of air-minded 
youngsters and their interest in gliding have been increased by these 
measures, and, above all, research has opened out new possibilities and 
has contradicted the prevailing belief that soaring depends entirely 
on the use of rising current over hill slopes. 

The investigations of rising currents in the free atmosphere car- 
ried out in the last few years at Darmstadt and at the Wasserkuppe 
have shown that soaring under cumulus clouds and near cold fronts 
is practicable, both entirely new conditions. 



GLIDING IN GERMANY — QEORGU 279 

« 

It has long been known that cumulus clouds are associated with 
rising currents of air, but few measurements were available. Ke- 
searcli was directed to the determination of these currents in the 
spring of 1928 from measuremonts of the vertical rate of a power 
plane gliding beneath a cumulus cloud with its airscrew stopped. 
Repeated glides of as long as 10 minutes without loss of height were 
obtained. 

Plate 10, Figure 2, shows a meteorgram of experimental flight, 
April 30, 1928. It is seen that there was no loss of height from 
point 7 to point 10 of the barogram, which implies a rising current 
of 2 m./sec. 

Plate 11, Figure 1, shows a reduction of experimental flight meas- 
urements in a rising current, July 12, 192S, and the observed descent 
of the airplane gliding. From this is subtracted the Imown sinking 
speed in still air. about 1.0 m./sec. The dillerence measures the 
vertical motion of the air. 

Fr(nn time 20 minutes to time 28 minutes there is a rising current 
of from 1 m./seo. to 2 m./sec, and from 28 minutes to 30 minutes 
of 2 m./sec. to 5 m./sec. These are high values and give excellent 
conditions for soaring in gliders, which have sinking speeds as low 
as 0.7 m./sec. 

Plate 11, Figure 2, shows a reduction of rising current measure- 
ments before a line squall, June 26, 1928. A " cold front " produced 
a line squall of moderate intensity, and the airplane, with airscrew 
stopped, maintained itself without loss of height for 15 minutes. 
From these results it was inferred that a soaring glider starting from 
the Wasserkiippe could reach the region of rising currents under a 
cumulus cloud or the front of an approaching squall, and this was 
successfully accomplished. 

Plate 12, Figure 2, shows a barogram of soaring flight by the 
Dannstadt, August 10, 1928. The barogram shows clearly the vig- 
orous efl'ect of the rising current under a cloud in comparison with 
that produced by a hill barrier. 

The Darmstadt maintained itself over the west slope of the 
"Wasserkuppe at 100 meters above the .starting point. In 20 minutes, 
the boundary of the up-current below an approaching cloud was 
reached and the glider was quickly carried up to a height of 400 m. 

Plate 12, Figure 1, shows a record of Kronfeld's flight at the Him- 
meldankberg, August, 1928. The plan of the course is .shown in full 
line under the cloud, in dotted line outside their influence. 

Kronfeld started from the western slope of the Wasserkuppe, and 
flew at once toward an approaching cumulus cloud, which he fol- 
lowed toward the east with continual gain of height, reaching 
Anally 470 m. above the starting point. The cloud began to dissipate 
and the up-current became ineflective, so that Kronfeld left it and 



280 ANNUAL, EEPOUT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 , 

flew with considerable loss of height to the Himmeldankberg as pre- 
arranged, and there soared for some time in the iip-currents. On the 
approach of another cumulus cloud Kronfeld used it to gain consid- 
erable height, and then flying always from cloud to cloud he reached 
the Wasserkuppe at his maximum height of 540 m. above the start- 
ing point. 

These details illustrate the difference between hill and cloud fly- 
ing, between flying from hill to hill over a course, which must be 
adjusted to the contours of the ground, and flying from cloud to 
cloud over hill and plain, when the ground is ignored and the 
pilot scans the cloud formations and adjusts his course to their 
motion. 

Plate 13, Figure 2, shows a barogram of Groenhoff's flight with 
a passenger on the 2-seater Rhoenadler^ Jiily 30, 1929. 

The next flight shows the extended performance obtained by fly- 
ing into the cloud instead of soaring below it. Groenhoff started 
from the west slope of the Wasserloippe and soared over it for a 
short time, then flew under a cumulus cloud and rose through it 
almost to its summit, reaching a maximum height of 1,250 m. above 
the starting point, and covering a course of 33.3 km., both figures 
being records for soaring fligiit with a passenger. 

The sinking speed of the glider in still air was 1.1 m./sec, from 
which the vigor of the upwinds may be inferred. 

Severe vertical gusts were met with in the cloud. At 1,800 m. 
the glider was driven down 140 m. in a few seconds and immediately 
after it was carried up 170 m. Two more such gusts followed after. 
The reduction gives a down-current of 9 m./sec, and an up-current 
of 10 m./sec. 

On the same day and under the same weather conditions Kronfeld 
made his great cross-country flight of 150 kilometers. Plate 13, 
Figure 1, shows Kronfeld's soaring flight from the Wasserkuppe 
to Bayreuth (150 km.) 

Immediately after the start Kronfeld flew under a cumulus cloud 
and was carried up continuously to a height 2,150 m. above the 
starting point. The up-current given by the measurements was 
5 m./sec. After leaving the cloud, height was slowly lost in passing 
over flat country. In two hours the Threungerwald was reached, 
and the flight was continued for 4 hours in the rising currents from 
the ridges. Finally a landing was made at the Fichtelgebirge 150 
kilometers from the Wasserkuppe. 

This masterly fliglit is a fine example of the art of soaring, and 
illustrates the manner of utilizing the various means available. In 
particular a record height in this manner wag gained in the up- 
current of a cumulus cloud formation sufficient to cross flat and 



GLIDIXO IN GERMAN Y — GEORGII 281 

hilly country alike, independently of the consideration of the 
surface. 

The niobt important result is the ease with which great heights 
can bo reached in the iip-currents of cumulus-cloud formations. The 
second part of the llight gives fresh evidence of the value of the 
older established method of flying in the up-currents from hills. 

A more recent development of cloud flying is the use of up-currents 
at tiie cold air fronts of line squalls, of which measurements with an 
engined aeroplane have been referred to. In this t3'^pe of atmos- 
pheric disturbance masses of warm air are pushed uj) by the inrush 
of cold air along the surface of the earth. Plate 14, Figure 1, shows 
motion of the air caused by cold air flowing in under warm air 
(W. Sclimidt). The lines of flow show the local direction of the 
wind. In front of the line squall the air rises almost vertically and 
offers the best soaring region. 

Plate 15, Figures 1, 2, and 3, shows Kronfeld's flight in front of a 
line squall (143 km.), the region of up-currents before the cold front, 
the barogram of the flight and the time changes in the line squall 
along the course. 

Kronfeld started at the moment when the wind was freshening, 
just before the passage of the line squall, and by utilizing the rising 
currents before the cold front rose 2,000 m. above the starting point. 
The middle part of the barogram shows that he then maintained 
steady flight. 

The meteorological records determine the motion of the storm 
accurately, and in conjunction with the pilot's account lead to the 
conclusion that he flew about 2 km. in front of the squall, rising 
or falling slightly as he was nearer or farther. After turning away 
from the front the glider rapidly lost height and landed 143 km. 
from the Wasserkuppe after 4V^ hours flight. 

The knowledge gained as to the configuration of line squalls, leads 
to the conclusion that there is no danger if the pilot keeps some 
distance before the advancing front. 

It appears from recent investigations at the research institute of 
the Khoen-Hossitten Gesellschaft that heights of 4,000 to 4,500 m. 
above the starting point may well be attained, in comparison with 
the existing record of 2,150, and that the cross-country record of 
150 km. may be increased in like proportion. 

Plate 6, Figure 2, shows a flight with towed glider at the Wasser- 
kuppe. Systematic experiments have been carried out by the society 
with gliders towed by power airplanes and released at a suflicient 
height to reach regions of up-currents and to continue independent 
cloud flying. Plate 2, Figure 1, siiows a flight with towed glider at 
Darmstadt.

THE PROSPECTS FOE SOARING FLIGHT 

The performances recorded above show that flying without engine 
power, by using the energy of rising currents in the atmosphere, 
is already established. We can not, indeed, expect it to meet the 
requirements of air transport, but its value as a sport can not be 
questioned, and as such is on a high level in its demand for phj'sical 
fitness, skill, quick decision, and courage, and in addition a serious 
study of the scientific and technical problems involved. 

Especially, soaring flight has had a beneficial effect on the design 
of light airplanes which now give performances with low engine 
power which were only possible formerly with powerful engines. 

The soaring glider with an auxiliary engine is unsatisfactory 
both as a glider and as a power airplane, and this line of develop- 
ment has been given up in Germany except for special research 
work. 

The research institute of the society has recently established a 
new and important system of aerodynamical tests of new aircraft 
types. In the first place free flights by large models of three to 
four meters span are carried out at small cost. When all that can 
be learned from the models has been recorded^ gliders of similar 
aerodynamical form are built and tested by a pilot in different 
flying attitudes. Finally, an engine is fitted and ordinary flying 
tests are carried out. In this way the successive steps in the devel- 
opment of a new type are carried, with minimum of cost and danger, 
to a point where the design of the full-sized airplane offers no 
serious uncertainties. 

The tailless Storch (" Stork ") was developed on these lines. Plate 
16, Figure 2, shows the Storch in model size; Plate 16, Figure 1, 
in glider size ; and Plate 14, Figure 2, as a light-power airplane. 

Fitted with an 8-horsepower engine it attained a speed of 125 
km./hr., and attracted much attention at tlie Tempelhof Flying 
Ground by its speed, maneuvering, and great stability, and gave 
impressive evidence in favor of this method of designing. The 
question remains whether gliding is a sound basis for piloting a 
power airplane. Opinion is divided, but it may be taken that glid- 
ing is a sound basis for further training, and soon tests the balance, 
touch, and eye. But a pupil who has mastered every branch of 
gliding still requires comprehensive further training when he goes 
on to power airplane piloting. Of far more importance than the 
preliminary training in hand and eye, is the extension of piloting 
experience to the special lore of the currents of the air, gathered in 
far richer measure during a flight of a hundred kilometers from hill 
to hill and from cloud to cloud, than in year-long flying on power 
aircraft. Such experiences will give a new generation of flying 



GUniNG IN GERMANY GEORGII 2S3 

men a body of weather wisdom by which they may safely meet and 
even turn to useful purpose the atmospheric disturbances so fre- 
quently met with in air transport today. Pilots of this school will 
imitate the exploits of Kronfeld, and so far from fearing wind and 
weather will master them and ride the storm front in their flights 
across the land. The true meaning of "air sense" lies in this con- 
quest of the variable atmosphere by the soaring pilot. Just as tiie 
master of a great liner must serve an apprenticeship in sailing ships 
to loarn the secret of sea and wind, so should tlie air transport pilot 
practice soaring flights to gain wider knowledge of air currents, to 
avoid their dangers and adapt them to his service. 

In confirmation of this view, pilots with soaring experience have 
shown their special worth in the difficult Lufthansa service across 
the Alps. 

It has not been possible within the limits of this paper to describe 
more full}' the growth of soaring flight, its present activities, its 
new problems and its future scope. I would call in aid all civilized 
nations, and particularly your own, in advancing its achievements 
to a higher level and opening to its activities all regions of the 
earth, temperate, and tropical. 

May I conclude with the hope that the unusual combination of 
scientific and sporting interest will bring you to join us, in friendly 
rivalry, in opening the regions of the air to man by means of soaring 
flight. 



THE FIRST liAINS AND TIIEIK GEOLOGICAL 
SIGNIFICANCE ' 



By AssAU Uauuinu 



In stiulying the sedimentary rooks one has to face problems of the 
most varying nature. I have before had occasion to discuss several 
of these, especially those related to the formation of conglomerates. 
In connection with my investigations on these rocks the following 
(piestions also arose: Which are the oldest sediments on the earth? 
Where do they occur? When were they formed? How are they 
constituted? As will be seen in the following these questions also 
involved others, and especially one of them — When did the first 
rains fall on our earth and what was their effect? — must stimulate 
our fancy. I shall here only present a few reflections, to which 
these and kindred questions have given occasion. 

THE CONGLOMERATES INDICATE OLDER SEDIMENTARY SERIES OP 

STRATA 

On examination of a conglomerate, pebbles of older sedimentary 
rocks are often found. These pebbles are naturally of a particular 
interest in cases where they are the only remains of a series of strata 
otherwise broken down. 

The Lower Cajnbrian sandstones and the basal conglomerates en- 
closed in them are the oldest known undoubtedly marine deposits 
in Sweden. They were formed on the shore of the Cambrian sea 
during its first transgression. In these conglomerates, however, 
pebbles of sedimentary rocl«, derived from earlier deposited strata, 
also occur. There is no reason for astonishment at the presence 
of these pebbles, as from several parts of the country we are aware 
of sedimentary series of strata of pre-Cambrian age, which are 
formed in continental basins. 

On turning to the pre-Cambrian series of strata, we also find in 
these only slightly metamorphosed sandstones and shales. But the 
rocks in the said series are for the most part more or less meta- 
morphic, transformed into quartzites, phyllites, mica-shists, and

286 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

paragneisses. We can, however, trace these sediments deep down 
in the Archaean without any difficulty. 

On close examination of a conglomerate in these series of strata 
we find as a rule also f)ebbles derived from still older sediments. 
As a natural sequence we ask ourselves : Is it possible to reach the 
bottom of the sedimentary formations ? 

WHEN WERE THE OLDEST SEDIMENTS FORMED? 

The sedimentary rocks are mostly deposited in water, and we may 
without hesitation say that sedimentary rocks have been formed 
as long as water has existed in liquid state on earth. 

When we have got so far in our discussion of the problem this 
question immediately presents itself: When did water appear in 
liquid state on earth? We can give no direct answer to the ques- 
tion, but we can make the reflection that, as soon as the temperature 
of the atmosphere and of the earth's surface falls below the boiling 
point of water, the atmospheric water begins to condense in the form 
of rain or dew. When the first rains fall, a new period of earth's 
history begins. We can infer the conditions of this period by study- 
ing the sediments, but we can only comprehend the extent of the 
change occurring at the transition to this period when the conditions 
on the earth's surface preceding the condensation of the water are 
clearly understood. 

THE CONDITION AT THE EARTH'S SURFACE DURING THE 
PREAQUATIC PERIOD OF THE EARTH 

During the time preceding the first condensation of the atmos- 
pheric water, during the period which we may call the preaquatic, 
igneous rocks and to a large extent also gneisses and other metamor- 
phic rocks were formed in the earth's crust. Sediments such as we 
now find covering the greater part of the earth's surface did not 
exist, but we can not say that clastic rocks were wholly absent. 
Loose material was produced as well by the tectonic movements in 
the earth's crust, at this early period no doubt very violent, as by 
variations in temperature. The bulk of the loose material on the 
surface of the earth, however, consisted undoubtedly of volcanic ash. 
This was carried far by the wind. No water basins existed, in which 
the ash could get lodged, no water solutions could deposit 
a cement binding together the grains. Where juvenile gases did not 
effect cementation, the material remained a loose mass. 

An ash-covercd earth, no traces of water, no traces of life. A hot 
surface of earth under a hot atmosphere, rich in water vapor and no

doubt also in ash dust. Volcanic cones and folding mountains of 
greater height than the present ones, tablelands (future continental 
platforms) and wide depressions (future oceans), equally void and 
ash colored. Thus may the earth be pictured before the condensa- 
tion of water. 

Then the first rains fall. 

Tin: EFFECT OF THE FIRST RAINS 

What a wonderful impression is made on us by that which now 
takes place! Falling drops hit a ground never touched by water, 
a ground so hot tliat it has not been able to hold any liquid water. 
What salts were not to be leached out ! How rapidly could not the 
rills cut deep grooves in the ash ! Never have the rivers been so 
full of mud as during this first condensation. Never have depres- 
sions been so quickly silted up, never have the oceanic basins had 
such a supply of salts, and never has the circulation of water by 
condensation and evaporation been greater than in this early period. 

However, if we do not allow ourselves to be wholly carried away 
by our imagination of this deluge, consideration will teach us that 
the progress was not as simple as related above. Certainly the 
condensation did not set in in such haste as my words perhaps 
implied. It is not even certain that the first condensation took 
place around the ash particles in the atmosphere. Perhaps the 
earth's crust did cool more rapidly than the atmosphere, so that 
the water was deposited in the form of dew. Perhaps it accumu- 
lated below the surface before it appeared on it. Even if the 
progress was the last mentioned, the formation of dew and rain 
may have occurred almost simultaneously, provided we measure the 
time with geological measures. We may expect an answer also 
to this question, whether the condensation was longest delayed owing 
to the high temperature of the earth or to the strong radiations 
of the sun. The problem is intimately connected with the cooling 
and shrinkage of the sun on the one hand, and with the gi'owing 
thickness and reduced emission of heat of the earth's crust on the 
other hand. 

We leave the initial time of condensation and turn instead to the 
epoch when the condensation is in progress an^ has already pro- 
ceeded so far that its geological effects have become perfectly dis- 
tinct. If it had been possible for us to see the changes effected, we 
should probably, apart from the appearance of bodies of water, 
have taken most notice of the redeposition of the loose material 
which has taken place. Subaquatic sedimentation has begun and 
has made a magnificent start. 



288 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

How, then, were these oldest subaqiiatic sediments constituted 
and how did they occur? 

THE OLDEST SUBAQUATIC SEDIMENTS 

The sediments deposited in connection with the first appearance 
of the seas were of a peculiar type. The material was entirely 
eruptive, mainly volcanic ashes. A sorting of it according to the 
size of the grains took place in connection with the transportation 
but, the material being for the most part and on large areas very 
fine and uniformly grained, this should have led to no more pro- 
nounced stratification. 

As the material was loose from the beginning, it could immediately 
be redeposited without previously being loosened b}^ weathering. 
Hence it follows that the oldest sediments to a large extent must 
have possessed the same mineralogical and chemical character as 
the igneous material (or, to put it more exactly, as the volcanic 
ashes) from which they were formed. Thus it was not clays, lime- 
stones and sandstones that constituted the first subaquatic series of 
strata but pyroclastic rocks more uniform in their character. 

The pyroclastic sediments grew rapidly thicker in larger as well 
as in smaller basins. In most places the subaquatic sediments rest 
on aeolian material, and it is not possible to show any petrographical 
difference between these aeolian and subaquatic parts of the series 
of strata. 

Upon the first, short period, with the formation of exclusively 
pyroclastic sediments, a second one follows during which the chem- 
ical effects of the water begin to be noticeable in the sediments. The 
leaching out of alkali, lime, and iron was, as mentioned, greater than 
during any other period in the earth's history, and probably the de- 
position of lime and iron compounds was very abundant, even though 
locally limited. A precipitation of for example ferric hydroxide 
might then as now take place on a very different scale in different 
basins. Differences in accessions, in the circulation of water, in the 
evaporative conditions, etc., interrupt the uniformity otherwise char- 
acterizing these early periods. 

We have hardly occasion in this connection to follow the develop- 
ment further. The next step in the subaquatic sedimentation fol- 
lowing immediately upon the one just mentioned, is the formation 
of sediments abundant in clay and quartz as well as those rich in 
lime and iron. We then have such a normal formation of sediments 
as may be followed through the geological periods up to our time. 

If the first subaquatic sediments have possessed a peculiar charac- 
ter and have had a magnificent development, one must ask if some- 
thing of them is not to be found in the earth's crust. 



THE FIT^ST RAINS — HADDING 289 

WHERE ARE THE OLDEST SEDIMENTARY ROCKS TO BE FOUND? 

As already preliminarily mentioned, the Loayoi- Cambrian con- 
<rlomerates contain pebbles from pre-Cambrian sediments, and the 
con<rlomerates in the Upper Archaean contain pebbles from earlier 
deposited sedimentary series of strata. In this way we can immedi- 
ately follow the formation of sediments back to the Lower Archaean. 

If we look for sedimentary rocks in the Lower Archaean, we must 
however understand (liat they can not appear in their orij^inal form. 
No part of the earth's crust has undergone so many and so thor- 
oughly metamorphic processes as the oldest one, and in no other part 
have the rocks been so mixed with injected igneous matter. 

Thus we can only expect to find the oldest sediments in a highly 
metamorphic shape and probably strongly broken up by younger 
igneous rocks. 

In the coui-se of time a great part of these rocks must have been 
destroyed by erosion or concealed below younger strata and partly 
also pressed down to such a level that they could partake in a mag- 
matic circulation. What now lies denuded can therefore only be a 
very small part of what once was formed. AVc turn to the oldest 
Archaean regions in search of it. 

The two regions to be thought of next are the North American 
and Fenno-Scandian. Both are well known by the ardent studies 
pursued for many years by a very great number of geologists, 
amongst whom we find several of the leading petrographers and 
geologists of the present and the past generation. Thanks to the 
works of these students we are at the present day very well able to 
survey the origin of the Archaean rocks. We shall only turn to the 
Swedish region. Is there then any cause to suspect that some of its 
rocks belong to the oldest sediments on the earth? My answer will 
without hesitation be affirmative, and I am persuaded that every- 
body, who knows the Swedish Archaean rocks, and who approves of 
ihe train of thouglit I have followed above, must answer in the same 
manner. And moreover, everybody must come to the same conclu- 
sion. The Swedish pyroclastic leptite formation contains the oldest 
.subaquatic sediments on the earth and the limestones and iron-ores 
connected with this formation bear evidence of the first chemical 
weathering and differentiation of sediments. We shall discuss the 
premises of this conclusion. 

No doubt, many will immediately object: "The iron ores in the 
Swedish leptite formation are igneous." Nobody can deny that ore- 
minerals occur primarily in the igneous rocks and certainly nobody 
can doubt that iron ores also may occur as products of magmatic 
differentiation. We have sufficiently good evidence of this in many 
quarters. But it does not imply that all ores occurring together with 



290 ANNUAL EEPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

igneous rocks are of magmatic origin. Least of all can we proceed 
from such a supposition in the case of ores among the Lower 
Archaean rocks. On the contrary we must, as I have shown above, 
take for granted that sedimentary iron ores not only can but also 
ought to be f)resent in the Lower Archaean. The metamorphism to 
which they have been exposed and the admixture of younger igneous 
matter, they may exhibit, only make the determination of their 
primary character more difficult. 

The same holds good to a certain extent of the limestones and other 
para rocks. Besides their chemical character, which indicates a 
sedimentary differentiation, their occurrence also shows that they 
belong to a sedimentary series of strata. We find them above the 
oldest gneisses, that contain neither pyroclastic elements nor rocks 
formed by sedimentary differentiation (limestones, iron ores, etc.), 
but they lie below the Upper Archaean with its abundance of fully 
differentiated sediments. Thus they occur just where the oldest 
sediments are to be found. 

This is not the place to discuss the primary character of the 
different gneisses or limestones nor to debate as to which ores may 
be considered of magmatic and which of sedimentary origin. The 
reason I have dwelt upon these questions has only been to emphasize 
the necessity of keeping in sight not only that different possibilities 
of interpretation exist but also that there are undoubtedly different 
types of rock, igneous and sedimentary, in the leptite formation. 
There is often great difficulty in judging their character and it is 
increased by the fact that the rocks formed by sedimentary differ- 
entiation, especially limestone and iron ore, frequently appear by 
subsequent liquefaction in intimate connection with igneous matters. 

As already mentioned, the mineralogically and chemically differ- 
entiated rocks belong to the second stage in the formation of the 
eldest subaquatic sediments. The first sedimentation by running 
and tranquil water consisted of a redeposition of the loose ash- 
material. When looking for the oldest subaquatic sediments we 
therefore may expect to find, besides the first sedimentarily differ- 
entiated ones, also those with the chemical character of the volcanic 
ash. These rocks ought, as a matter of fact, to form the greater part 
of the oldest sediments, and we may take it for granted that they 
originally had the character of tuffs. 

Do then traces of these pyroclastic rocks also exist in the Lower 
Archaean? Yes, not only traces but large masses. They appear 
first in the leptite formation and form the bulk of it. It is fully 
manifested that Swedish leptites as well as the hiilleflinta are mostly 
and often entirely constituted of volcanic ash. It is also known 
that these rocks occur almost spontaneously in enormous quantities 
in the Lower Archaean and likewise that they are accompanied by 



THE FDIST RAINS — HADDING 291 

the oldest known strongly diflferentiated rocks. I find it therefore 
lo<Tically correct to draw the conclusion from the })roniiscs given 
in the quoted material that the leptite formation is formed on the lli'bt 
appearance of liquid water in the earth. 

The reasons of the above-mentioned conclusion may be summed 
up as follows: 

1. Normal subaquatic sediments are found in several places in 
the younger part of the Archaean. We can easily follow the sedi- 
mentary series of strata in a more or less metamorphic sha[)e down 
to the Lower Archaean. In this then Ave have to look for the oldest 
sediments. 

2. The Lower Archaean is nowhere easier of access than in Swe- 
den. Therefore we may expect to find traces of the oldest sedi- 
ments in the Lower Archaean of Sweden. 

3. liocks of sedimentary origin occur in the Swedish leptite 
formation, which we consider as the upper part of the Lower 
Archaean. These rocks are partly strongly differentiated (above 
all limestone and iron ores), partly undifferentiated, of pyroclastic 
origin. 

4. It has not been possible to show any rocks of sedimentary origin 
in the part of the Archaean that is older than the leptite formation. 

As to the progress of formation we may add : 

5. Before the condensation of the water the earth's surface was 
to a large extent covered with loose volcanic ash, which was bound 
only by juvenile gases and lava beds. 

6. By the ai)pearance of liquid water the ash was formed into 
enormous quantities of tuffs, that soon came to enclose leaching 
products also, above all lime and iron compounds. The chemical- 
mineralogical differentiation was gradually accomplished by normal 
weathering and sedimentation. The pyroclastic roclis then became 
less conspicuous and normal sediments dominated. 

We may sum up the argument thus: The details are debatable but 
only one opinion on the process as a whole and its general results is 
possible. From this point of view we must conclude that the leptite 
formation ctmtains the oldest sediments of the earth, and that these 
were formed in connection with the first condensation of the water. 

SOME MORE PROBLEMS 

Though I have now discussed the problem of nearest interest to 
me I can not forbear to mention a few more that are directly con- 
nected with this. One of them concerns the question : How far back 
in the earth's history does the first appearance of the water lie? 

We are accustomed to use large figures when stating the age 
of rocks belon«;ing to one formation or another. These fiirures are 



292 ANNUAL EEPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

also widely varying according to the estimate of age being made 
on the one principle or the other. If the age of the oceans is esti- 
mated from their percentage of salts to be 50 to 200 millions of 
years or from their accession of sediments 35 to 400 millions, we 
Ftill have no satisfactory knowledge of the time of the water's 
first appearance. From the disintegration of the radioactive ele- 
ments the age of a great many different rocks has been estimated. 
According to such an estimate the age of a rock belonging to the 
Lower Archaean but younger than the oldest sediments would 
be 1,300 millions of years. It seems probable to me that 1 or 2 
milliards of years have passed since the first rains fell on the earth. 
I shall, however, abstain from any further discussion of this prob- 
lem, as I can not give any new contribution to its solution. I shall 
instead draw attention to an attempt to compute the age of the 
earth at the time of the crust's solidification. Herold Jeffreys at 
Cambridge published a work in 1924 entitled " The Earth," in which 
he asserts that the earth's transition from a gaseous mass to liquid 
form must have taken place in less than 5,000 years. After a further 
10,000 years or when the earth was less than 15,000 years old, it had, 
according to the estimates of Jeffreys, a solid crust of such thick- 
ness that the strong radiation of heat was prevented. It may of 
course be supposed that a good deal of time had still to pass be- 
fore the water began to condense, but the quoted figures are undeni- 
ably amazingly small compared to the millions upon millions of years, 
by which we compute the age of the following formations. 

Another problem of geological interest is the following: Did 
the first condensation occur somewhat simultaneously all over the 
globe, or did it start in certain places, for example at the poles ? In 
the latter case an essential part of the enormous percentage of 
water in the atmosphere would be discharged in certain regions. 
This would no doubt also have left its marks on the sedimentation. 
If the inclination of the earth's axis toward the plane of the ecliptic 
was not too small, the condensation was no doubt begun at the poles 
and in the winter half year. At any rate this ought to have been 
the case, if the condensation was longest prevented by the radia- 
tion of the sun and not by the heat of the earth. However, I shall 
also desist from further discussion of this problem and the possible 
significance of the distribution of the leptites for its interpretation. 

Then one more problem, the last one : Witli the condensation of the 
water the development of the organic cells is made possible. We maj'^, 
without running the risk of being refuted, say that no living organisms 
existed on the earth before the first rains fell. Water accumulated 
gradually in large and smaller depressions. It was hot or warm 
water and, in several basins at least, rather strongly saline (or ac-

count of tlie strong leaching of the volcanic ash and the strong evap- 
oration). Thus the conditions for the origin of life, i. e., for an or- 
ganic cell's formation and growth, were favorable. It also appears 
most natural to me to imagine life begun at this time. If an organic 
cell could be formed in the one pool, it could also be formed in the 
other, and we then come to the conclusion that the origin of organic 
life on the earth may be derived from several pr')to[)lasms. To ex- 
plain the appearance of life on the earth by accession of germs from 
other heavenly bodies is only to push the problem away. It then re- 
mains to explain its appearance in the place from where it first 
comes. We have no occasion to suppose the conditions on other plan- 
ets to have been more favorable for the formation of a cell than 
those on our earth. 

SUMMARY 

A survey of the problems connected with the first condensation of 
water on the earth gives us an idea of the significance of this process. 
The problems are astronomical, geophysical and geochemical, geolog- 
ical, and biological. The size and temperature of the sun as well as 
the thickness of the earth's crust and the radiation of heat through it 
were decisive of the temperature in the atmosphere of the earth. The 
quantity of water and probably also that of dust in the atmosphere 
were decisive of the temperature of condensation. 

The nature of the atmosphere, the movements in it, the possibili- 
ties of local (polar) condensation, the formation of dew and rain are 
other paleo-meteorological problems of great interest. 

The conditions of the earth's surface before the condensation, the 
direct influences of the condensation on the superficial layers, the 
size and progress of the erosion, the nature and development of the 
sediments, the nature of the first marine basins, the variations of the 
salinity in different basins and in the oceans on the point of forma- 
tion are circumstances that may possibly become objects of investi- 
gations and computations. 

The division of land and sea also becomes an actual question by 
the appearance of water. 

The chemical weathering and leaching out of soluble salts begins 
first after the condensation of water. The chemical sorting of the 
material takes place simultaneously as well as the cementation by 
l!ie precipitation of substances dissolved in water. All the rocks 
formed by sedimentary differentiation belong to the period after the 
condensation. 

Finally I draw attention to the biological significance of the con- 
densation. This and this only made it possible for the organic cells 
to develop and continue to live on the earth.

The first rains, or perhaps more correctly the first condensation of 
the atmospheric water, are of perfectly revolutionizing significance, 
geologically, geochemically, and biologically. There would be rea- 
sons to call the preaquatic time the primeval of the earth and the 
time between the first condensation of water and the more general 
appearance of determinable forms of animals the prehistoric time 
of the earth and, finally, to refer the remaining younger parts to the 
historic time of the earth. At any rate, the significance of the first 
condensation of the water is not overestimated by this, that the time 
of its appearance is made the boundary between two of the greatest 
periods in the earth's history of evolution. 

As I already preliminarily stated, I only present a few reflections 
here. I have hinted at the problems, and if I, with regard to the 
geological ones, have also dared to make some suggestions as to their 
solution, I have made them, fully conscious of the fact that the prob- 
lems are still equally fresh and alluring and in man}'- points quite 
unsolved. 



WEATHER AND GLACIATION 



By Chester A. Reeds 



INTRODUCTION 

Weather as it afTects p^laciation is a subject Avhich has been under 
observation during the past century. Remnants of the last glacia- 
tion still exist in Greenland, Antarctica, and on some of the islands 
of the polar regions and in tlie high mountain fastnesses of the 
temperate and tropical zones. Weather conditions are modifying 
these ice masses; in fact, the variability of the weather causes 
glaciers to grow at certain times and Avane during other periods. 
The changes that are going on to-day are apparently similar to 
those that took place during past ages. 

There is a distinction between weather and climate. Climate is 
the average of normal conditions of the atmosphere, while weather 
constitutes the variations from the normal. Weather changes are 
of a day-to-day occurrence. When averaged for the year and for 
longer periods, they yield differences which make the weather of 
one year vary from that of another, as Tvell as for groups of years. 

During the last decade a few meteorologists have correlated 
weather changes with variations in solar radiation. This correlation 
has been specially emphasized by H. H. Clayton in his volume. 
World Weather, 1923. The correlation of changes in glaciation 
with solar radiation variations has been mentioned b}' various scien- 
tists, but it has not been discussed in the light of recent develop- 
ments. In this paper special application of these changes to glacial 
deposits at Haverstraw, N. Y., and New Haven, Conn., will be made. 

THE CONDITIONINC, OF ICE SHEETS AND GLACIERS 

Tlierc arc two opposing factors which modify ice masses — namely, 
nourishment and depletion. Nourishment consists primarily of snow- 
fall, hoar frost, rime, glaze, sleet, and needles, or spiculae, sometimes 
referred to as " frost snow " or " polar snow." According to Antevs 
(1929), depletion occurs through melting, evaporation, discharge of 
bergs, etc. Melting, which is the most important agent, takes place 
through high temperature, insolation, and to a minor degree from

rain, air, wind, and water. Glaciers advance after heavy winter 
precipitations followed by low summer temperatures and cloudiness. 
They retreat following slight winter snowfalls, high sunniier tem- 
peratures, and clear sky. 

It has been said that the cause of the principal variations in the 
present size and condition of glaciers in Alaska is due to variations 
in altitude, in latitude, in precipitation, and in direction of slope 
(Tarr and Martin, 1914) . Fluctuations in Alpine glaciers have been 
traced back to about 1600 A. D.; in Norwegian glaciers, to about 
1700 A. D. Yearly measurements were begun on the Rhone Glacier 
in 1874 and on other glaciers in various parts of the world since 
1894. Weather changes are not immediately recorded at the termi- 
nal end of an ice mass, since glaciers vary as to size of the neve field, 
depth of the catchment basin, width of the fern field, length of the 
ice tongue, etc. For example, small glaciers in the Alps began to 
advance in 1909 and 1910; medium-sized glaciers in 1912 and 1913, 
while long valley glaciers, such as the Aletsch, did not advance until 
1920, when it moved forward 120 feet, and a greater amount in 1921. 
The variability of the weather thus causes glaciers to advance or 
retreat, but not all at the same time; for, being of different sizes, 
their respective masses, as well as other factors, tend to govern their 
movements. 

SOME PROPERTIES OF ICE 

Under the influence of heat, ice behaves as most solids do, con- 
tracting when cooled, expanding when heated. As regards the evap- 
oration of ice, it was shown by Barnes and Vipond in 1909 that it 
goes directly into vapor without passing through a preliminary 
liquid phase. The melting point of ice is lowered by increase of 
pressure. The rate at which this occurs is 0.0075° C. for every 
atmosphere of pressure. This fact Avas theoretically predicted by 
James Thomson in 1849 and demonstrated by Sir W. Thomson (Lord 
Kelvin) in 1850. 

Although there is no rise of temperature accompanying the melt- 
ing of ice, a definite quantity of heat is absorbed — namely, about 80 
calories per gram, or 78.818 thermal units. The same amount of 
heat is evolved when water becomes ice — that is, the amount of heat 
required to convert ice into water, or vice versa, would raise the same 
amount of water through 80° C. This is the latent heat of fusion 
of ice or the latent heat of water. Because of this fact, ice is the 
most difficult of all solids to melt, as regards the amount of heat 
energy required to be put into it in order to effect fusion, and water 
the most difficult liquid to freeze of all substances, owing to the 
relatively large amount of the latent heat needed. It is fourteen 
times as great as for lead and twenty-eight times as great as for 
mercury. 



WEATnER AND GLACIATION — REEDS 297 

The temperature at which water reaches its maximum density is 
39.2° F. (3.945° C), accordinpj to the researches of Joule and Play- 
fair. When cmiled below this temperature water expands instead 
of contractingr, and the expansion goes on to the total extent of 
^j^^ of its bulk, until freezinjr occurs, at 32° F. (0° C), when 
there is a sudden expansive leap of neai-ly a tenth of the whole 
volume of the water as it freezes to form ice. 

The X-ray study of ice crystals by Sir William Bragg (1925) 
shows that ice contains an open hexagonal lattice structure consisting 
of four molecules of water. This lattice structure reveals why ice 
can be melted under pressure and how it is possible for water (with 
the molecules closely compressed) to occup}' less space than ice. It 
also accounts for the sudden and relatively enormous expansion 
which occurs when water freezes. On becoming ice, the w^ater has 
increased in bulk by 9 per cent, and this increase occurs instanta- 
neously and with enormous, well-nigh irresistible, force. It also 
explains why ice is lighter than water and why ice floats on lakes, 
rivers, and the open sea with about one-tenth of its volume above 
water level. 

The fresh water of lakes continues to contract with increasing cold. 
The surface waters, being colder, and thus heavier, sink, and the 
warmer waters from the bottom rise to the surface. The convection 
currents thus set up continue until all of the water in the lakes has 
been reduced to the maximum density of water, after which the 
circulation stops, for the surface waters, when cooled to lower 
temperatures, remain on top and grow steadily colder until they 
suddenly freeze at 32° F. (0° C). 

SOLAR RADIATION VARIATIONS 

The sun's rays supply nearly all of the heat of the earth's surface. 
They affect not only the weather, but also insolation and tempera- 
lure, two of the agencies conditioning ice masses; hence a brief 
consideration of solar radiation is important in discussing weather 
and glaciation. 

In 1837 Pouillet invented the pyrheliometer, with which he en- 
deavored to measure the heat of the sun. Violle, Crova, Chowlson, 
and the Angstroms followed him and increased the knowledge of 
the subject. Langley invented the bolometer for studying the selec- 
tive absorption and the scattering of light in the atmosphere. With 
this instrument he measured, during 1002. 1903, and 1904, the solar 
radiation, corrected for atmospheric influence, and announced that 
the intensity of solar radiation is subject to irregular variations due 
to conditions in the sun itself. 

More recently Dr. C. G. Abbot, Secretary of the Smithsonian 
Institution, has improved the instruments and methods of Langley

and determined the mean of the " solar constant " to be 1.938 calo- 
ries per minute per square centimeter. Sohir radiation is subject 
to variations which, although slight, are important. The value of 
the " solar constant " at a given time may differ from the mean. 
The highest monthly mean for the years 1918 to 1929 was 1.969 for 
September, 1921 ; the lowest, 1.912 for July, 1922, giving a range of 
0.057, or 2.9 per cent. The highest yearly mean for the same period 

was 1.952 for 1921, and 
the lowest 1.927 for 1922, 
or a range of 1.3 per cent, 
according to solar con- 
stant values supplied by 
Doctor Abbot in a per- 
sonal communication of 
November, 1929. 

The "solar constant" 
variations for the period 
1905 to 1929, inclusive, 
have been arranged in the 
form of a graph. Figure 
1, by entering the yearly 
mean fluctuations on the 
ordinates and the years 
on the abscissa. This is 
the same method and grid 
used in Figures 2 to 13 
for the varved clays. The 
value, 1.900, is equivalent 
to the base line. The 
original drawing has been 
reduced one-half during 
publication. 

According to Wolfer's 
sun-spot numbers, there 
was a maximum of spots 
in February, 1907, a min- 
imum in May-June, 1913 ; 
a maximum in August, 1917, a minimum in August, 1923, and a maxi- 
mum in July, 1928. These figures, when compared with the solar 
radiation values, as noted in Figure 1, show a relation between them 
in the 11-year cycle. Abbot (1929) states that the solar radiation 
rises to a maximum with medium sun-spot numbers and declines 
thereafter as sun-spot numbers increase. Furthermore, superposed 
on the sun-spot influence variation there appears to be three pulses 
of regular periods of about 25, 15, and 11 months respectively, and

of amplitudes which are hii«!;o enou'jjh, when combined in similar 
phase, to nearly overpower the maximum sun-spot effect on the 
solar-constant values. 

The li)05 to li)2i) monthly avera<4es of sun spots show little appar- 
ent relation with that of solar radiation. The yearly means, how- 
ever, 11)05-1921), exhibit a more evident comparison. A closer resem- 
blance between the two is secured when the U to 4 year oscillations in 
solar radiation, which are not appreciable in sun spots, are smoothed 
by means of four, and further smoothed by taking the means of each 
consecutive two means, Figure 1, as was done by Clayton (1923). 

Accordin*^ to Abbot (1920), the intensity of solar radiation is ex- 
})ecled to increase when sun spots are numerous. However, when an 
individual sun spot crosses the central part of the sun a depression 
in solar radiation is usually noticeable, which is attributed to a sort 
of cloudiness over each sun-spot group. The resulting depressing 
effect may exceed one of increased radiation. Thus it nuiy be said 
that there is a real relation, though not a very close one, between 
sun spots and solar radiation. 

EFFECTS OF ATMOSPHERIC OPACITY 

The radiation from the sun which reaches the earth is considerably 
reduced by the opacity of the earth's atmosphere. According to 
H. N. Russell (1926), only about 7U per cent of the initial solar radi- 
ation gets through to sea level when the sun is at the zenith and the 
air is free from dust and clouds. The opacity increases as the sun 
approaches the horizon, due to the greater distance the rays have to 
travel through the atmosphere and the loss of the shorter rays by 
diffraction. The only satisfactory way of dealing with the?e varia- 
tions is to measure with the spectrobolometer the energy received 
when the sun is at various altitudes. Each different wave length 
has to be measured separately to tletermine the depletion for each 
and the various amounts summed up to find the total solar radiation 
outside the atmosphere. The process is definite, but laborious. 

Normal opacity of the air may be much increased by the presence 
of four by-products, which may be regarded as factors that affect 
solar radiation — namely, water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, and 
dust. Water vapor has the most thermostatic influence. In tropical 
regions, where the humidity is high, nearly half of the sun's heat is 
absorbed by a cloudless sky. A cloud surface may reflect more than 
70 per cent of the sun's rays and absorb a large jiart of the remain- 
der, while a canopy of dense clouds may permit onl}' a small ])art of 
the sun's radiant energy to reach the earth. Since carbon dioxide 
and ozone are present in the air in very small quantities, their influ- 
ence is subordinate to that of water vapor. Ozone probably absorbs 



300 ANNUAL KEPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

some of the solar radiation, since laboratory experiments tend to 
show that it does. 

Dust in the air causes a decrease of the solar radiation reaching 
the earth. When dust is blown to heights of 10 to 50 miles by vol- 
canic eruptions — that is, into the isothermal region or stratosphere — 
the direct solar radiation at high sun may be reduced as much as 
20 per cent, as was noted following the Katmai eruption of June 6, 
1912. Not all great volcanic eruptions decrease the surface tem- 
peratures of the earth, but only those that drive a lot of dust into the 
isothermal region of the atmosphere. Volcanic eruptions during his- 
toric times and their influence on solar radiation and the weather 
have been traced. Such eruptions may have accounted for many of 
the great changes in the weather that the earth has experienced. 
W. J. Humphreys has accepted this view and formed his vulcanism 
theory of glaciation. 

Humphreys (1920) considers the average size of the volcanic dust 
particles in the stratosphere to be 1.85 microns. He calculates that 
it would require about one year for such particles to fall from an ele- 
vation of 35 km. to the lower limit of the stratosphere, which has an 
elevation above sea level of 17 km. in tropical latitudes, 11 km. in 
middle latitudes, and 6 km. in polar regions. He considers the finest 
volcanic dust, which may have reached an altitude of 40 to 80 km, 
following the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 and Katmai in 1912, and 
which encircled the earth a number of times, to have taken two and 
one-half to three years to reach the base of the stratosphere, or upper 
cloud level. He estimates that the total quantity of volcanic dust 
required to cut down the intensity of the direct solar radiation by 
20 per cent to be only the 174th part of a cubic kilometer, or the 727th 
part of a cubic mile, assuming that the particles are spherical. Since 
the particles are more or less flat, it is probable that not more than 
the 1,500th part of a cubic mile, or the 350th part of a cubic kilo- 
meter, is needed to reduce the intensity of direct solar radiation 20 
per cent. This amount, if indefinitely continued, he concludes, would 
be capable of producing an ice age. 

With the particles all being 1.85 microns in size, he calculates that 
the volcanic dust is some thirtyfold more effective in shutting out 
solar radiation than it is in keeping terrestrial radiation in. This is 
because radiation, both solar and terrestrial, is simply scattered by 
such small particles and scattered in proportion to the inverse fourth 
power of the wave length. Since the ratio of solar wave length to 
terrestrial wave length is, roughly, 1 to 25, and the ratio to their 
fourth powers as 1 to 39 x 10*, it follows that the interception of 
outgoing radiation by the very finest, and therefore most persistent, 
dust is wholly negligible in comparison with its interception of in- 
comine: solar radiation.

SOLAR RADIATION AND THE WEATHKR 

Since 1915 H. H. Clayton, retired, formerly chief forecaster for 
Argentina, has been \mnrr the averajxes of jrroiips of hifrli, medium, 
and low solar radiation valuos of the Astrophysical Observatory of 
the Smithsonian Institution in attempting to correlate them with at- 
mospheric changes on the earth. He has compared these means with 
the means of temj^eratnre and pressure variations scattered over the 
earth and attained results wliich show sj'stematic changes which 
seem difficult to explain on any other grounds than a real relation. 

The more usual solar find nations are irregular and occup}' a few 
days or weeks. Clayton (1923) obtained the best comparisons of 
day-to-day fluctuations by averaging the values of each phenomenon 
in groups of 5, 10, or more days, after allowing, in some instances, an 
interval of 3 days for a lag in the efTect. He noted a tendency to 
short-period variations in 3.5, 7, and 13.5 daj's, which he attributed 
to successive outbreaks of faculae on the solar surface. Traces of 
similar tendencies in the weather were also observed. 

Cla'vton also noted solar radiation values of similar kind at inter- 
vals of about 11 and 16 days, which he correlated with the movement 
of heated gases from one side of the sun to the other. These heated 
gases are associated with solar faculae. He observed similar varia- 
tions in temperature at Buenos Aires in 1921. 

In addition to the day-to-day variations, Clayton has averaged 
those for monthly, yearly, and longer periods and established an 
intimate relation between them and those of the weather. He ob- 
serves that the complexity of the weather changes arise from com- 
plexities of solar radiation in Mhich changes of short period are 
mixed with progressively longer waves of change going up into years 
and centuries. 

Clavlon has shown that with an increase of solar radiation the tem- 
perature rises and the pressure falls in equatorial regions and is 
immediately followed by a rise of pressure and a fall of temperatures 
in temperate regions, reaching a maximum between latitudes 40° and 
G0° north and south. Over the oceans, in still higlier latitudes, G0° 
to 70°, the relation is again direct, as in the tropics — that is, the tem- 
perature rises and the pressure falls with increase in solar radiation. 
From the region of maximum rise of pressure, a wave of returning 
pressure starts toward the Equator with a velocity inversely pro- 
portional to the length of the solar cycle and drifts eastward with 
the eastward drift of tlie atmosphere, dying out in low latitudes. 
This effect is true, whether the increase in solar radiation be for 
a few days, for months, for years, or for longer periods. With the 
solar radiation below normal, the effects for the different regions for 
the same time of year are the reverse of those when there is an equiv- 
alent excess of solar radiation. 



302 ANNUAL REPOPvT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

As noted by Clayton, the monthly means of solar radiation and 
those of temperature and pressure show that with an increase in in- 
tensity of solar radiation the maxima of pressure form over the 
coldest parts of the temperate zones, which are the continents in 
winter and the oceans in summer. The more intense the radiation, 
the farther north and south are these maxima of pressure formed. 
The abnormal distributions of temperature and precipitation are in- 
timately related to the distribution of pressure. Thus the centers 
of action move north and south of their mean position with the vary- 
ing intensities of solar radiation. There is a lag in the solar effect 
near the centers of action proportional to the duration of the solar 
change. In general the lag is about one-tAvelfth of the length of the 
interval from maximum to maximum or minimum to minimum. 
The lag may vary from a few hours to a year, depending on the 
duration of the effect. 

The year-to-year variations in solar radiation are shown by Clay- 
ton to be connected with year-to-year variations in rainfall and river 
heights in North America, South America, and Australia. He also 
observes that the solar measurements clearly indicate the existence 
of a 3 to 4 year change in solar radiation, which is reflected in a 
3 to 4 year change in pressure, rainfall, etc. This he attributes to 
a variability in the intensity and amount of faculae on the surface 
of the sun. 

Clayton's studies of the effect of maximum and minimum sun-spot 
periods on the weather show that the pressure is lower at the time 
of maximum sun spots in the equatorial zone, especially in the humid 
regions, at all times of the year. The differences of pressure are, 
however, much less than in the case of the monthly means. Koppen 
has shown that the mean temperature of the surface air over the 
globe was lower at sun-spot maximum than at sun-spot minimum. 
Although much has been written concerning the effect of sun spots 
on the weather, investigators agree that weather conditions are far 
more variable than sun-spot numbers. 

RECORDS OF WEATHER CHANGES EXTENDING OVER MANY YEARS 

Weather changes extending over long periods of time are reflected 
in the annual growth rings of trees (Douglass, 1909, 1914, 1919, 1928, 
1929; Huntington, 1914). Harris (1926), in considering the correla- 
tion between sun-spot numbers and tree growth, concludes that the 
coefficients indicate a low positive correlation between them, but the 
relationship is by no means so intimate as many writers imply. 

The best-preserved records of weather affecting glaciation are 
found in the aqueo-glacial deposits of Pleistocene age, which pre- 
serve seasonal, annual, and longer period variations. The deposits 
are commonly known as laminated or varved glacial clays. 



WEATHER AND GLACIATION — REEDS 303 

These laminated jrlacial clays, which record the annual retreat 
and ablation of the last continental ice sheet, have been studied, 
durinir the last 20 years, in North America, Sweden, Finland, Ice- 
land, Arjzentina, and the northwestern Himalaya Mountains of 
India. While the primary object of the investigation has been 
the establishment of a <ieochronoh)«rical time scale, with the varve 
or year as the unit of measurement, a study of the variations in 
thickness preserved in the seasonal and annual layers is of special 
interest, since it involves weather changes which affectetl the melting 
of the ice during its retreat. 

The material composing the varved clays was brought directly 
from the melting ice by subglacial streams and deposited in fresh 
or sliglitly brackish water lying in front of the receding ice mass. 
The mud was brought into the lake during the annual melting 
period — that is. the summer months. The quantity delivered was 
in all probability proportional to the quantity of ice that under- 
went melting. It apparently was not directly influenced by the 
nourishment of the ice as was the retreat of the ice front. Thick 
varves thus signify a long period of warm summer weather; thin 
varves imply short summers, with cold and foggy weather. The 
varve graphs which have been published, showing summer and 
winter thicknesses, record fairly accurately the yearly variations of 
the amount of summer temperature. 

The lamination of the clay sediments postulates a strict peri- 
odicity, not only in the melting of the ice and the deposition of the 
" summer " layer, but a pause of several months, during which 
time the supply of sediment is interrupted and the fine clay particles, 
which remain suspended in the fresh- water lakes following the 
summer influx, have had sufficient time to settle to the bottom and 
form the dark "winter" layer, consisting of pure clay. No phe- 
nomena other than seasonal variation — that is, the alternation of 
summer and winter — meets this postulate. Varved clay sediments 
produced by this seasonal variation are being deposited now in Lake 
Louise, Alberta, Canada (Johnston, 1922). 

In addition to the .seasonal variation, there is an annual or varve 
variation in which changes in thickness occur from year to year. 
The thickness of the varves usually varies in different basins from 
a few millimeters to 3 or 4 cm., sometimes more. For instance, 
the varves in the Hudson River Basin at Haverstraw, N. Y., average 
35 nmi. (1.38 inches) in thickness, while those in the Quinnipiac 
Basin, near New Haven, Conn., average 23.24 mm. (0.02 of an inch). 
The relative differences as well as other structural featiires, how- 
ever, remain constant over wide regions as well as over widely 
scattered occurrences. Thus it is possible to identify and correlate 
the varves in separate sections. 



304 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

With samples of the material in hand the correlation is often 
effected by a comparison of the variations in thickness, color, or 
peculiar lamination of successive varves or groups of varves. The 
seasonal and yearly variations are also noticeable when measuring 
the thickness of the sediments in the field on strips of paper. Their 
relative values, however, are made more apparent when plotted 
graphically, according to a method initiated by Gerard de Geer, of 
Sweden, in 1906. The diagram consists of a horizontal base line 
from which arise a number of vertical lines spaced one-half centi- 
meter apart. These equally spaced lines on the abscissa are numbered 
to represent the varves or years. The thickness of the successive 
varves from the bottom upward are entered as ordinates from left 
to right on the successive vertical lines and the tops united with one 
another to make them stand out more effectively. A comparison of 
such diagrams representing different sections brings out whether they 
are common varves and how they are related to one another. 
(Fig. 2.) 

Varved clays are extensively represented in the Pleistocene epoch 
(De Geer, 1910, 1912, 1921, 1926, 1927a, 192T5 ; Antevs, 1922, 1925, 
1928; Norin, 1927; Keeds, 1926, 1927; Sauramo, 1923, 1929; Sayles, 
1919). They are also represented in glaciations older than the 
Pleistocene (Antevs, 1925; Reeds, 1923; Sayles, 1914; Schuchert, 
1914; Sussmilcli and David, 1919). 

FLUCTUATIONS IN HAVERSTRAW AND NEW HAVEN VARVED CLAYS 

In order to investigate the possible relation between varved clays, 
glaciation, and weather, the laminated clays at Haverstraw, N. Y., 
and New Haven, Conn., have been measured, correlated, and specially 
diagramed. The Haverstraw clays extend along the west bank of 
the Hudson River from a mile south to 2 miles north of the town and 
reach inland one-half mile from the river front. These clays vary 
in thickness from 50 feet in a 60-foot terrace facing the Hudson 
River in west Haverstraw to more than 100 feet in the low plain 
bordering the river bank. The New Haven clays occur in the low- 
lying Quinnipiac River Valley, in the eastern portion of the city. 

The varves in the Haverstraw clays were measured, correlated, and 
diagramed by Chester A. Reeds and Ernest Antevs, working inde- 
pendently. The Reeds diagram of 736 varves was shown and accom- 
panied by abstracts at the Cleveland, 1927, meeting of the Geological 
Society of America, while Antevs' Haverstraw curve appeared in 
March, 1928, in his book. The Last Glaciation, published by the 
American Geographical Society, Research Series No. 17, as graphs

straw, also appear diagramed and described in his report as graphs 
labeled New Haven, C2, C3, Plate II. 

In Figure 2 appears an example of the correlation which Reeds 
has made of the varves occurring in five separate clay pits at Haver- 
straw, N. Y. Seventy varves, with field numbers +20 to +90, serial 
numbers 231-301, appear on this diagram. The thickness of the 
" summer " and " winter " layers in each varve has been differen- 
tiated, the " winter " band being represented by a black shading, 
the " summer " layer by the ruled vertical line extending from the 
base line upward to the beginning of the winter layer in each sec- 
tion. Five such graphs, one for each pit, appear on the diagram. 
As the curves closely simulate one another in their oscillations, the 
correlation may be said to be firmly established. The thickness of 
the varves in each graph has been averaged and the mean for each 
determined, as follows: Hornbecker pit, 14.8 mm.; Dunnegan pit, 
15.1 mm.; Washburn-Fowler pit, 23.9 mm.; Morrisey pit, 26.0 
mm.; Renn and Archer pits, 27.4 mm. This variation in thickness 
of the deposits is attributed primarily to their location and elevation, 
during the deposition of the clay. The Hornbecker and Dunnegan 
pits, which are a quarter of a mile apart in west Haverstraw, have 
been cut into the 60-foot escarpment, which is one-half mile distant 
from the Hudson River. The Washburn-Fowler pit, a quarter of a 
mile long, stretches lengthwise from near the floor of the Dunnegan 
pit eastward on the flood plain of the Hudson River. The Morrisey 
and Renn-Archer pits are deep ones, appearing south of Jones Point, 
near the Hudson River front, in Haverstraw. They are fully a mile 
southeast of the Hornbecker, Dunnegan, and Washburn-Fowler pits, 
in West Haverstraw. The Haverstraw deposits, when contrasted 
with those in West Haverstraw, show not only a greater average 
thickness, but particularly so for the corresponding winter layers. 
These variations are due, no doubt, to a greater depth of water and 
volume of sediments over the Jones Point area in Haverstraw, al- 
though farther from the ice front, than the terrace banks in West 
Haverstraw, which were f artheest removed from the main channel of 
the glacio-fluvial river, the Hudson. With a greater depth of water 
and a larger volume of sediments in the main channel than near the 
margins of the lake, it is not surprising that during the winter 
months more clay particles settled down through the cold milky 
waters to form the thicker " winter " layer at Jones Point than that 
on the sites of the Hornbecker and Dunnegan pits. Each of the five 
curves has been smoothed by taking the average of each four succes- 
sive varves. The smoothed curves have been entered as single-line 
graphs above the other curves by using the mean of each section as 
a base line. A comparison of these smoothed curves shows a close 
agreement in all of the pits. These smoothed graphs represent a

suggested correlation with the more prominent short-cycle varia- 
tions of weather and solar radiation as noted by Clayton (1923). 

To form a " normal curve " for the entire series of varved clays at 
Haverstraw, the five partial sections shown on Figure 2 and those 
from other similar sheets were averaged and drawn as one curve to 
form the Reeds graph represented in the lower portion of Figures 3 
to 13. The Reeds curve is characterized by dark shading for the 
winter layers. The Antevs Haverstraw curve, consisting of 732 
varves, occupies the middle position, while the curve of the New 
Haven sediments, representing 343 varves, is placed at the top. The 
varves as represented in the three curves correlate closely. Each of 
these curves represents the mean of the varve measurements taken 
in different clay pits. They are thus " normal curves." Antevs' 
curves have been developed from measurements taken in the field 
usually from three to five sections, while the data for Reeds' curve 
have been taken from field samples preserved in metal trays. The 
normal number of parallel sections used by Reeds was 5, but in some 
portions of his curve as many as 14 sections were averaged. 

When the Haverstraw and New Haven varved clay graphs are 
compared they agree closely in contour. The mean, however, of the 
Reeds Haverstraw curve shows an average thickness of 35 mm., the 
Antevs Haverstraw curve 32.31 mm., and the Antevs New Haven 
curve 23.24 mm. These graphs show, furthermore, a variation in 
the thickness of sediments in groups of 3, 4, or 5 years, with occasional 
larger and smaller groups. This group arrangement suggests a 
correlation with the weather and solar radiation changes as noted by 
Clayton (1923). Accordingly, the mean of each four consecutive 
varves, in each curve, has been taken and set above the normal curve 
by using the mean of each curve as a base line — that is, the 35 mm. 
line in the Reeds curve. The consecutive groups of four varves, 
which were averaged in this manner, have been joined by a horizontal 
line near the base of each graph. The Reeds Haverstraw curve has 
been further smoothed by taking the mean of each two consecutive 
groups of four varves — that is, 8 varves, as indicated on the charts ; 
also of every 11 varves. According to Clayton, the 8 or 11 year 
curves give some idea as to what the sun-spot curve for this 736-year 
period might have been like. 

These smoothed curves show not only the more prominent group 
fluctuations in the deposition of the clay, but also those minor stages 
in the melting of the retreating ice fields. When the curve is above 
the mean, it indicates a period of more active melting and deposition 
and the reverse conditions when it is below. 

In Figure 14 the smoothed curve, derived from Reeds' normal 
curve by taking the mean of each successive group of four varves,

has been arranged on the graph spacing used in Figures 2 to 13. 
This arrangement permits the entire smoothed curve of 736 varves 
to be placed on one sheet. The annual varves do not appear. It 
also affords an opportunity to see at a glance the more prominent 
major fluctuations and periodicities in the melting of the ice. Regu- 
lar cycles are not apparent. The first prominent warm period was 
for the years 52-68. This was followed by a comparatively cold 
period to the 112th year, but it was not as cold as during the next 
192 years, terminating with varve 300. For eight years, 300-308, 
the melting of the ice almost reached the normal between cold and 
warm temperatures. From 308 to 332 the curve moves gradually 
downward, indicating a 24-year period when the successive summers 
were progressively colder. Then, during the next 204 years, there 
follows a series of short cycles of warm and cold periods of vary- 
ing length, which were for the most part below normal, terminating 
with 528 years. Then, curiously enough, the last 208 years, 528 to 
736, were cyclic in form, but predominantly warm — that is, above 
the normal or mean line. When an opportunity has arisen to check 
varves 52 to 68 and 700 to 716 with varves from other localities, 
then we shall know whether these abnormal fluctuations were caused 
by excessively warm periods or were accentuated by local causes. 

PERIODICITIES IN VARVE CLAY GRAPHS AND TELECONNECTIONS 

Periodicities in varve graphs have been noted by W. Koppen 
(1928), C. E. P. Brooks (1928), and E. Antevs (1929). Koppen 
recognized periods of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years in North American 
varves, with the period of 2, 3, 4, and 5 years being frequent. Brooks 
has analyzed the teleconnections of De Geer between Sweden, North 
America, Argentina, and India. In Argentina he notes cycles of 
5.1, 10.4, and 51 years in a curve secured by Doctor Caldenius at 
Lago Corintos, which was described and figured by De Geer (1927). 
The period of 10.4 years noted by -Brooks approaches the 11-year 
sun-spot curve in length, but not in rhythm. In fact, Brooks com- 
ments on the almost entire absence of an 11-year periodicity in the 
varved clays. Antevs states that while stadial moraines indicate 
the periodical retreat of the ice edge and are especially suited for 
long-range periodic phenomena, the clays enable us to determine 
the exact length and character of the periods. The varve graphs 
are best suited for the study of short cycles. He regards the al- 
most complete absence of the 11-year cycle in the curves studied 
by Brooks as being perhaps the most important result so far obtained 
from the analyses of varve curves. 

Brooks (1928), in discussing De Geer's (1926) teleconnections 
between Zealand (Denmark) and the Little Ferry, N. J., clays of 
the Hackensack Valley, which were described and diagramed by 



WEATHER AND OLACIATION REEDS 321 

Reeds (192C), calls attention to two correlation coefficients, one of 
+ 35, which suggests that the teleconnections appear to be undenia- 
ble; the other of +24, whicii shows that nearly half the apparent 
connections are due to a 2-year periodicity coiunion to botli. Brooks 
makes further comments, but it does not seem desirable to feature 
them, since Do Oeers correlations, in this instance arc premature and 
misleading. Keeds informed l)e (Jeer of this fact in August, 1927. 

On Plate II (1) De Geer attempts to correlate: (1) The Swedish 
curve, years 5540 to 5029, with portions of Reeds' Hackensack curve 
and Antevs' Connecticut Valley curve; (2) through years 5029 to 
5684 he arranges the Hackensack and Connecticut Valley curves 
in juxtaposition; (3) for years 5000 to 5892 he places Hackensack 
varves opposite Scanian (southern Swedish) varves; (4) for years 
5736 to 5809 he diagrams varves from Dutchess Junction, N. Y., 
opposite those from Hackensack and Scania. 

The objections to the aforementioned teleconnections are as 
follows : 

A. The agreement between the various graphs is apparently not 
close enougii to suggest a correlation. 

B. The direction of ice retreat from the terminal moraine on 
Staten Island and Long Island was northward up the Hackensack, 
Hudson, Connecticut, and smaller river valleys. As the ice border, 
which extended in a general east-west direction, retreated northward 
at a rate somewhat less than 100 feet per year, clays were de- 
posited in marginal glacial lakes in the separate river basins. The 
Hackensack Valley clays at Little Ferry, N. J., are the southernmost 
exposures and consequently the oldest known in eastern North 
America. Twenty-five miles to the north of Little Ferry, and in 
direct line of retreat of the ice, is Haverstraw, N. Y., with the oldest 
clays appearing in the Hudson River Basin. The Hackensack and 
Hudson River Basins, although parallel for nearly 50 miles, are 
separated by the Palisade Ridge and Verdriderger Hook. Fifteen 
miles to the north of Haverstraw, in direct line of retreat of the ice 
and on the north side of the Highlands of the Hudson, is Dutchess 
Junction, N. Y. 

C. Antevs (1928) has definitely correlated the Haverstraw clays 
with those in the Quinnipiac River Basin at New Haven, Conn. 
Likewise, he correlates the Dutchess Junction clays with Hartford, 
Conn., clays. The 2,500 varves in the Hackensack clays, being older 
than the Haverstraw clays, are not considered in the correlations 
which Antevs has established between Connecticut localities and the 
Hudson River Valley. 

D. The geographical position of the localities in New Jersey, New 
York, and Connecticut with reference to ice retreat and deposition, 
as well as the correlations which Antevs has established in eastern 



322 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

North America, render De Geer's correlation of Hackensack clays 
with Dutchess Junction and Connecticut Valley clays as premature 
and misleading. It will be necessary for Brooks to revise his coeffi- 
cients of correlation again when the teleconnections between Sweden 
and eastern North America have been established. 

SUGGESTED CORRELATION OF SOLAR RADIATION, WEATHER, AND 
VARVED CLAY VARIATIONS 

It has been stated that the character of the weather during the 
melting period of the ice varied from year to year, and that these 
fluctuations arc reflected in the varying thickness of the annual de- 
posits (Bruckner, 1921; Osborn and Reeds, 1922; Sauramo, 1929). 
After calling attention to wide range correlations or teleconnections 
between Sweden, North America, Argentina, and northwestern 
Himalayas, in which more than 80 per cent of the varves are said 
to agree, De Geer (1927) states: 

This remarkable coincidence of such rapid variations at such considerable 
distances, caused by simultaneous ice melting, seems not to be explicable in any 
other way than by variations in the amount of heat from the sun. 

De Geer (1926) states that the rate of melting depends almost en- 
tirely on the intensity of solar radiation. In those temperate regions 
which were glaciated during the Pleistocene epoch he considers that 
practically all of the solar radiation was spent in melting the ac- 
cumulated snow and ice, while now, after the yearly snow and ice 
is melted, the balance is available for warming the ground. During 
the retreat of the ice he notes that the changes in solar radiatiojn 
correspond fairly well with the changing amount of melting water. 
Since this water found its way to the ice edge, he considers that the 
amount of reassorted morainic material eroded and carried away 
by the subglacial rivers varied very nearly at the same rate as the 
amount of melting water. Furthermore, by getting accurate meas- 
urements of the annual amount of the finest and most regularly de- 
posited sediment from such waters (varved clays), he considers it 
would be about the same as getting readings from a gigantic natural 
self -registering thermograph. Brooks (1928) suggests solarigraph 
for thermograph. 

A comparison of Figure 1 with Figures 2 to 13 shows that the 
solar radiation variations, when plotted in the same manner, are 
not different in kind from those of the varved clays. In fact, it is 
surprising how close the solar fluctuations simulate those of the 
varved clays. No direct comparison can be made between them, 
since the years represented in Figures 1 and 2 to 13 are not con- 
temporaneous. The close agreement in the form of the graphs, 
however, leads one to offer a tentative correlation of the annual solar 
radiation variations with those of the varved clays. Clayton has 



WEATHER AND GLACIATION REEDS 



323 



shown that there is a real rchitioii between sohir radiation varia- 
tions and weather chanjres; and, since weather atlecls the condiiion- 
\nrr of fdaciers and is reflected in the varve fjraphs shown herewith, 




a suf^gestcd correlation of solar radiation weather and varved clay 
variations is here proposed. 

CONCLUSION 

It may be stated that weather, as distinguished from climate, 
affects the conditions of ice masses daily, seasonally, annually, and 



324 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

in groups of years of varying length. Glaciers are conditioned by 
opposing factors, nourishment, and depletion. These, in turn, are 
governed by changes in the weather and in the amount of solar 
heat. The intensity of solar radiation reaching the earth is affected 
by the amount of water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, and dust in 
the air; also by irregular variations in the sun itself. The varia- 
tions in the sun fluctuate slightly about a mean of 1.938 calories 
per minute per square centimeter. Although these solar variations 
are moderate, they are important, for a real relation between them 
and weather changes, as well as glacial conditions on the earth, is 
strongly suggested. The records preserved in living and fossil 
trees and varved glacial clays show not only seasonal and annual 
variations, but also fluctuations for irregular groups of years, which 
seem difficult to explain on any other grounds than a real relation 
between them and the changes in weather and solar radiation. 

The graphs of solar constant and varved clay variations appear- 
ing in this paper show that they are not unlike; in fact, they bear 
close resemblances. Short cycles, averaging four years in length, 
are prominent, as shown by the smoothed curves. Longer periods 
as noted in Figure 14 are not wanting. 

A special study of Haverstraw and New Plaven varved clays of 
the last glaciation (fig. 15) shows that their fluctuations in thickness 
were due not to local causes, but to primary factors embracing a strict 
periodicity in the melting of the ice, summer by summer. The fact 
that these fluctuations vary from year to .year, and for short as well 
as for long irregular cycles, shows that these variations were gov- 
erned by changes in the weather and solar radiation extending over 
a period of more than seven and one-third centuries.

WILD LIFE ' PROTECTION— AN URGENT PROBLEM 



By Ernest P. Walker 
Assistant Director, National Zooloffical Park 



[With 4 plates] 



When the white man first reached America he found a country 
generally abound infj in biir ^ame, upland birds, waterfowl, fur 
bearers, fish, turtles, and fro«;s, which could be used as food or in 
other ways. It was necessary for him to utilize these and he did 
so with profit to himself. In his settlement of the country, he 
destroyed the forests, plowed the prairies, drained the swamps, 
grazed his stock on the hills to the injury of the forage, and gen- 
erally greatly depleted the wild stock and restricted the areas avail- 
able to the wild forms that first made his existence on the continent 
possible. The condition is essentially the same throughout the world 
wherever man has settled. Now, man's greatly increased progeny 
still has the desire for the wild life or its products, but some forms 
have been exterminated and nearly all have been so far reduced 
that the supply is far short of the demand. Some people value 
animal life for itself, others for the recreation of taking it, others 
for the profit to be derived from it, and others for the beauty or 
usefulness of its products. 

Some of the depletion and restriction of the habitats has been 
inevitable, but much has been the result of thoughtlessness and a 
disregard for the future and can be remedied. The so-called 
" development of natural resources " has all too often consisted of 
taking what nature has supplied without providing for a continu- 
ance of the resource. It has been little less than exploiting or loot- 
ing and was never development in a true sense. The time lias now 
arrived when real development work must be carried out if our 
wild life resources are to be perpetuated in such quantities as to 
be of material value and benefit to us. 

Not only the United States and its possessions but the remainder 
of the world has large tracts of so-called " waste land " well adapted 
to raising different kinds of wild life that are needed by mankind 

'The term "wild life" as herein used refers to all forms of wild verti'bratcs. 

327 



328 ANNUAL EEPOKT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

but which are now producing little or nothing. Many lands that 
may require 50 years to grow a crop of timber can, during that 
period, produce annual crops of fur and game with no detriment to 
the growing timber; and some of the abandoned farm lands are 
probably better adapted to raising profitable crops of wild life 
than they ever were to domestic crops. 

ProjDer administration can greatly increase our yield of wild life 
and place the various species on a secure constant production basis 
instead of the precarious existence many of them now experience. 
Financial or recreational values can be restored where little or none 
have existed since the time when man depleted or destroyed the 
original stock. 

We are supposedly living in a machine age, and we utilize ma- 
chinery whenever possible. We should therefore utilize animal life 
to convert vegetation into more valuable products, for such animals 
as beavers and deer convert surplus vegetation into fur or meat, 
while the carnivores accomplish the same result b}^ eating animals 
that have already converted vegetation into meat. 

To produce such crops, however, in paying quantities will require 
the application of wild-animal husbandry, just as good management 
is necessary in domestic livestock raising. 

American principles of wild life protection are based upon 
the premise that the wild life of the country is the property of the 
people, represented by the Government, and the individual has no 
title in it except as he subjects the wild life to possession in accord- 
ance with laws or regulations or in the absence of any prohibition 
against the taking. The landowner has no right to the life merely 
because it occurs on his land. He may take it there only under the 
general conditions prescribed, which usually apply to landowner 
and nonlandowner alike. The landowner may prevent others from 
taking the animals on his land only by preventing trespassing. On 
the public domain, that is, land owned by the Federal, State, or 
county governments, permission to take animals is usually granted 
to all who obtain licenses or can qualify as to residence or citizenship 
requirements when such are required. This almost invariably re- 
sults in the taking of more animals than should be killed if the stock 
is to be maintained. 

The system does not encourage the individual to leave wild life 
to breed in order that the supply may be increased, for there is 
no assurance that he who exercises moderation in his killing will 
profit by his discretion. On the contrary, the next hunter, trapper, 
or fisherman may take an unreasonable number, even within legal 
limits, and kill the very animals that the first man has left as 
breeding stock. This system seems to have been modeled upon the 
saying "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush." If our 



WILD LIFE PROTECTION WALKER 329 

wild life is to be saved, wc have the option of givii)"; it more com- 
plete protection or of abandonin*; tiie principle that any one who 
qualities as to license, citizenship, or residence recpiirements may 
enjj:a«^e in taking it. In other words, we have before us the innninent 
prospect of practical extermination of those forms of wild life 
commonly taken by mankind, unless we adopt stringent enforce- 
ment of laws and regulatit)ns for their protection or gjive the 
landowner control of wild life on his lands. In the latter event 
the man who does not own land will have no place to hunt, trap, 
or fish unless he obtains the privilege from the landowner. 

A few people realize the reasons for the depletion of wild life 
and know that in many instances proper^ wild-life administration 
will restore interesting and valuable forms, but the greater number 
tlo not know that conditions can be remedied, and they accept the 
exhaustion of the natural resources as inevitable. 

The idea expressed by one concern selling fiu-bearing atiimal 
stock that '• fur wearers are breeding faster than fur bearers " can 
well be applied to all kinds of wild animals used by man. As no 
adequate substitutes have been found for the animals themselves 
and many of their proilucts, and as we have not reached the stage 
of checking the rate of increase in human demand, the only remedj' 
apparent is to increase the wild life. 

This indicates a very definite field for the student of wild life, for 
he is the only one qualified to determine the true relative value 
of the various forms of wild life and to advise legislative bodies, 
game protective organizations, and the public in general as to their 
value and the proper steps that should be taken to perpetuate the 
animals and assure the maximum returns. 

The array of forms that have been exterminated locally or en- 
tirely, or that have been seriously depleted, is generally better 
known to scientific men than to any other group, and they are in 
the best position to show the values of such life. With the various 
means of the present time for presenting information — through the 
daily press, magazines, special circulars, motion pictures, the radio, 
and personal lectures — the scientific man has ample facilities for 
reaching the public. 

The public is glad to receive autlioritative information from the 
scientific man provided the material is presented so that it can 
readily be understood. Legislative bodies and game protective 
organizations also appreciate his assistance and advice. 

The almost universal interest in animal life and its behavior as 
shown by the regularity Avith which hunting, fishing, or discussion 
of animal actions arises in gatherings of men free to discuss varied 
subjects augurs well for the success of a program to gain the interest 
and support of the public in the movement for wild-life upbuilding. 



330 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

The harmonizing of the various interests and the development of 
well defined programs for wild-life administration requires the broad 
and technical training of naturalists. They alone are in a position 
to anticipate the far-reaching results of protection or control meas- 
ures. Furthermore, because of their interest in the wild life they 
should be the leaders in its proper development and administration. 
The field of technical advisors to wild-life administrators is a large 
one and as yet practically untouched. From the wildest and most 
remote tracts in the world to small city parks, there are problems 
relating to wild-life administration and it is doubtful if there is in 
existence to-day an organization administering wild-life protection 
that does not have numerous unsolved problems of a biological nature 
that are handicapping its work. 

Successful protection of the wild life of any region or country is 
primarily contingent upon the development of an attitude on the 
part of a majority of the people favorable to wild-life perpetuation. 
Protection is necessarily based upon public sentiment, well drafted 
laws, and their vigorous and impartial enforcement. To obtain 
either the enactment of good laws or their successful enforcement it 
is necessary that the masses of the public realize that it is to their 
benefit to protect wild life. This points out the great importance 
of developing methods of showing the value of wild life, means to 
employ for its preservation and the benefits to be derived from 
protection. 

Heretofore, the sportsmen or a very few foresighted and coura- 
geous lovers of wild life have led minority fights for its protection. 
Some of these fights have ultimately been successful and have ac- 
complished great good, but they have been hard struggles and the 
burden has been heavy on the few who were worldng for the general 
benefit. Many good causes have failed and most of those that have 
succeeded have been limited in scope to the lines in which the spon- 
sors were most interested. As might be expected, the result of vari- 
ous groups of diverse interests taking up the matter of protection 
of the objects of their particular interest has produced inconsistent 
local legislation, usually designed for the protection of one group 
of wild life, often at the expense of another, which in some instances 
has been of equal value. 

In keeping with the development of the legislation, the enforce- 
ment of the laws has frequently been spasmodic and inconsistent and 
often in the hands of those interested in particular kinds of game, 
fur, or fish rather than wild life as a whole, which has resulted 
harmfully in some instances. With a few outstanding exceptions we 
have had no consistent wild-life administration programs. That is, 
but few regions have developed really consistent and properly bal- 
anced wild-life laws and enforcement calculated to develop the maxi- 



WILD LIFE PROTECTION WALKER 331 

mum benefits from all forms of wild life that mi<;ht be produced 
on the hinds or in their watei-s. 

The relative values of the various kinds of wild life have not ordi- 
narily been carefully considered. If the dominant group was inter- 
ested in upland game birds or waterfowl these forms were usually 
given fair protection and other forms of life ignored, while sucli 
interesting and valualde fur bearers as raccoons, skunks, and minks 
were termed vermin and campaigns of extermination waged against 
them. If big game was the principal object of concern, other forms 
were neglected. 

As the scientific man observes the policies and work of the game 
administrators, his frank, unprejudiced commendation as well as 
criticism will be of value and will encourage adherence to sound 
policies. The custom of human nature to be silent when matters are 
satisfactory and to speak oidy when displeased often makes it dif- 
ficult for public officials to adhere to the course that is best for the 
greatest number of people. While the masses are satisfied and silent 
the selfish interests are criticising, and attacking, and exerting every 
effort to gain their ends. More frequent expressions of approbation 
might assist the officials in following the correct path. 

"Wild-animal husbandry is a field almost as novel as the term itself 
and offers problems comparable to those being worked out by stock 
raisers and farmers who are assisted by technical advisors and 
experiment stations. As a whole, the basic problem is that of 
obtaining the maximum continuous production under wild con- 
ditions. 

The relatively new industry of fur farming shows that animals 
at one time scarcely considered can be raised at a profit. The pro- 
duction of wild animals might be compared with the ranging of 
cattle, sheep, and horses on the western stock ranges of the United 
States. As tracts are inclosed a more intensive and better controlled 
production can be obtained, which would be comparable to some of 
the modern fur farms. Figuratively speaking, the minks and 
martens may play about the feet of the deer in the forests, while 
young muskrats and baby ducks romp in the marshy edge of the 
lake and watch the fish jumping in deeper water. 

In addition to the general work needed by the county. State, and 
Federal agencies concerned with wild-life protection, there is a 
field for the biologist conservationist (bio-conservationist) in assist- 
ing clubs and landowners to make their tracts yield properly. Such 
positions may be termed consulting naturalists or technical wild- 
life advisors. 

There are innumerable wild-life administration problems to be 
solved. Among the outstanding of these are the determination of 
the maximum numbers of various species that can be produced on 



332 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

areas of various types, and the combinations of animal life on va- 
rious areas that will yield the maximum returns either in money, or 
pleasure, without detriment to other interests. 

The raising of more than one kind of crop at a time on land is 
very appealing to the agriculturist, and in wild-animal husbandry 
this practice is particularly applicable. For example a tract while 
growing timber on the uplands can produce beavers and mink in 
the streams and bonds, raccoons and opossums will roam the entire 
area with the foxes and deer, and some fish can be raised in the 
streams and ponds in excess of those killed by the minks, while frogs 
and turtles may supplement the yield. 

The working out of methods by which the carrying capacity of 
areas may be determined is an important problem that has a wide 
application. Excellent progress has been made in determining how 
many sheep or cattle should be grazed on various types of stock 
ranges and much good has resulted from application of the knowl- 
edge obtained. Similar need exists for yardsticks by which we 
can ascertain how many deer or elk can be produced on a given 
tract or how many beavers or muskrats, or both, can be raised on 
various lakes and streams, and how many fish can be raised in such 
waters at the same time. How many raccoons, mink, otters, turtles, 
and frogs can be produced on a given swamp? Could greater reve- 
nue be derived by raising waterfowl, or should a compromise be 
aimed at and a combined harvest of fish, turtles, frogs, fur bearers, 
and birds be sought? What kinds of stock should be placed on a 
tract and how many of each kind? 

In line with the teaching of the proper times and methods of tak- 
ing wild life is the teaching of proper methods of preserving animals 
or animal products for use or for the market. Ignorance and 
neglect of the best methods of preparing the pelts of fur bearers an- 
nually costs the trappers a surprising sum. Waste of game meat 
and other products should be unheard of in the present day but it 
occurs regularly among sportsmen who apparently do not inform 
themselves how to care for game and by aborigines and some others 
who regularly live upon game. The prohibition against com- 
mercialization of parts of game animals has resulted in the waste of 
many fine skins and heads of such animals killed for food purposes. 
Certainly no provision should be advocated which will stimulate 
greater killing of valuable forms where the supply is already in- 
adequate, but thought can well be devoted to devising means of per- 
mitting the utilization of all parts of the animals that are law- 
fully killed. 

Determining the proper proportions on the range of the sexes of 
polygamous game animals such as deer and elk is a problem that has 
a direct bearing on the formulation of laws and regulations for the 
protection of these animals.

Presentations of the cash values of wnld life produced on given 
areas well stocked as compared with the revenue from the same 
areas or similar tracts poorly stocked or producini; farm crops of 
limited value often can he usetl with convincing effect. Tiiis can be 
strikingly shown by assembling such figures as are available of game 
manmials, birds, fur bearers, frogs, turtles, or fish that have been 
taken from known areas such as islands, lakes, counties, or States an<l 
nmltiplying the number by the present values of such animals. In 
many cases it will sliow that the wild stock that can be produced on 
the area is far more valuable than the <l(»mestic products now being

PROGRESSIVE UTILIZATION AND EXTERMINATION OF A SPECIES 

FlOURI 1 

In an effort to show diagrammatically or graphically the progres- 
sive utilization and extermination of a species,- the design shown 
in Figure 1 has been developed. It is an attempt to enable one to 
visualize what to-day is probably the greatest problem with which 
the wilddife a<lministrator is confronted. It is based upon the fact 
that a given area of land or water or both can continuously support 
only a certain maximum number of breeding animals and their prog- 
eny until tlie repi-odiictive stage of such progeny is reached. There 
are, of course, innumerable factors that affect this condition, but the 



•This and certain otlior diaKianiH and pxtracts hiTPln are taken from the autbor'.s 
paper Getting Public Support for .MnnimnI Prot«>ctl«n published in the Journal of 
Mammalogy, vol. 9, No. 3, pp. 195-200, August, 1928. 



334 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

basic principle is that an area can sustain up to and not beyond 
a certain abundance. If the stock is increased above the carryini; 
capacity of the area its productive capacity is lessened, and this 
naturally leads to ultimate reduction of numbers. If the area is 
not fully stocked it will not produce as large a crop as it might 
under best utilization. 

If more than the normal surplus produced by the basic breeding 
stock is taken, the breeding supply will be reduced and production 
can not be sustained. If all the surplus is not used it is not only 
wasted but it also becomes a source of danger through overstocking. 

This is intended to make clear the fact that there is a definite 
critical point which, if passed in the case of any valuable animal 
or plant, leads to reduced production and threatened extermination. 

It can be shown that by building up the wild stock a surplus can 
be provided that may be harvested at a profit, and indeed it must be 
removed to prevent overstocking. The work of the biologist is to

determine the dividing line which is not always clearly defined and 
varies as conditions change. 

Reliable statistics applied to the graph in Figure 1 will show 
the trend of the wild life population. Appropriate action then be- 
comes obvious. 

The steps in increasing the wild-life supply may be graphically 
illustrated by the inverted pyramid. 

The problem is one of arithmetical progression and by application 
of the proper figures appropriate to the species, region, and condi- 
tions of life it is possible to illustrate the case quite clearly. The 
method is applicable in illustrating the increase of injurious forms 
as well as beneficial ones. 

With the foundation idea established of maintaining a definite 
maximum breeding stock and harvesting only the surplus, we next 
have for consideration factors that must guide us in harvesting the 
surplus. Different factors, of course, are operative in different 
animals.

WILD LIFE PROTECTION — WALKER

The land fur bearers are a group of maniuials that are utilized 
in a rather uniform manner and are subject to certain fairly con- 
stant factors and the changes in the value of their skins in the course 
of a year can be shown grapiiically in what might be termed "The 
Cycle of the Fur." The graphs are not intended to be exact but 
rather to illustrate the underlying principle. They are based upon 
statistics of Alaska furs, supplemented by an intimate knowledge 
of fur conditions in the territory. They have also been modified to 
meet suggestions made by fur dealers and trappers. Each graph 
represents a general average for the various species in southeastern 
Alaska over a period of years, but can also represent equally well an 
individual fur bearer. 

The practical application of these is obvious, namely to indicate 
the proper period for open seasons. It will be seen that the peaks 
of primeness do not coincide 
for all the animals. This 
clearly demonstrates the need 
for the fur seasons being ad- 
justed for the various species 
if the maximum values are to 
be derived from the animals 
taken during open seasons. 
The next problem is to dem- 
onstrate to the public why it 
is good business to prevent 
encroachment on the breed- 
ing reserve; and if the stock 
has already been depleted it 
is even more important to in- 
dicate where use must be 
curtailed in order to restore the proi)er capital t)i" breeding stock. 

To illustrate this, the fur bearers have again been drawn upon for 
an example. It is well known that in general the trapper takes 
the greatest portion of his total catch during the earlier part of 
the season; and that the daily catch declines as the end of the season 
approaches. This, of course, is due to the fact that there are more 
animals available for him at the opening of the season and that 
they are less wary and thus more easily taken. To illustrate this 
point and another still to be brought out, let us assume that on a 
given area 1,000 skins of a fur bearer might be taken during a 
3-months' open season. The first month there would probably be 
575 tak(>n, the second month 375, and the third month 50. 

In the example just given it lias been indicated that 1,000 skins 
would be taken on the area. Let us assume, however, that the tak-

ing of this number of animals Avill not only consume the surplus but 
will also make inroads on the basic breeding stock or capital. Under 
these conditions a wise administration demands that the taking of 
part of this number be prevented. How can this be done and still 
satisfy the trapper, the manufacturer, and the consuming public? 
If the season be shortened a little at both ends, reducing it to two 
months, let us suppose that this will save 50 animals and that it 
will prevent encroaching on the breeding stock. It is a matter of 
surprise to many that the 950 animals taken in two months will be 
worth more than would be the 1,000 taken in three months.

Figure 8 

This may be illustrated by combining the graph showing pelt value 
by primeness with that showing the total fur taken by months. Of 
the 1,000 animals trapped, the 575 of the first month of the open 
season will be taken mainl}^ before they are prime or in the best 
market condition; the 375 of the second month are the only ones 
taken within the period of their maximum value ; and the 50 of the 



WILD LIFE PROTECTION — WALKER 341 

third month are taken when their value has considerably declined. 

The value of this take would bo about as follows : 

575 anlnmls nt $7 $4,025.00 

375 unliiijila at $8.25 3, 4»W. 75 

50 animals at $7.50 375.00

20.00

On the other hand the two months' season allowing a take of J)50 
animals with fur in prime condition in practically all cases would 
produce : 

575 skins at $9.25 $5,318.75 

375 skins at $9 3,375.00 

Total value of 950 skins 8.693.75 

Thus by taking r)0 fewer animals in two months the actual re- 
ceipts from the fur crop wouhl be $825 more than would have been 
brought by the 1,000 animals taken over a period of three months. 

In this way the two principal objects liave been accomplished, 
namely saving the adequate breeding .stock and increasing the profits.

Another means of enabling visualization of a problem in con- 
nection with the harvesting of the fur crop is the diagram on page 
341 that shows the relative values of different sizes of beaver skins, 
otherwise alike.

This should convince the most skeptical trapper that it is to his 
interest so to conduct his trapping operations that the young and 
small beavers are allowed to grow up before they are trapped, and 
it points out the desirability of trying to develop trapping methods 
and practices that will avoid the taking of the young animals, or, 
if they are taken, of liberating them.

Such a method of calculating animal life as is outlined by Lin- 
coln ' in " Culcuhitinn; Waterfowl Abundance on the Basis of Band- 
ing Returns " is well worth giving a thorough trial under varying 
conditions. It is a direct application of the method heretofore used 
of calculating the value of basic breeding stock on the assumption 
tliat tiie animals annually taken bear a more or less definite 
relationship to the basic stock, 

Taylor's "Methods of Determining Rodent Pressure on the 
Range " * points out some methods of making studies of certain types 
of animal life and the practical apjjlication of such work.

administration. Fur again furnishes a good illustration. The 
graphs of the " Cycle of the Fur " show that there is a varying but 
short period when the skins of animals are in a condition of the 
maximum value. Tliis condition may be compared to the condition 
of grain or fruit when it is said to be " ripe " or the condition of 
meat animals when they are said to be "finished." Among trap- 
pers the wortl " prime " is commonly used and is very satisfactory. 
However, one writer has criticized the use of the term because 
skins can not always be positively referred to either the groups of 
prime or unprinie. Skins can, however, be so designated as accu- 
rately as many forms of produce can be graded, but it may be desir- 
able to establish certain standards with a series of grades as has been 
done for cotton, grains, and meat. 

When biologists have entered upon such studies as are needed in 
wild-life administration, it will bo found that the problems are 
fully as interesting as those In other lines of biology and there is a

keen satisfaction to be derived from the development of scientific 
data which has an immediate practical application. In addition, 
studying the problems of wild-life administration develops infor- 
mation in biology relating to life histories and to ecology that is 
of the utmost importance in biological sciences in general. 

Even the few problems herein mentioned cause one to wonder 
where capable men are to be found to undertake these and the in- 
numerable other problems that are not mentioned. It is probable 
that with the increase in wild vertebrate conservation which is neces- 
sary if the wild life is to be built up some of the biologists now 
engaged in other lines will take up the new work, but it would seem 
that there is a need for universities to give special training along 
such lines. Scholarships might well be established, and special re- 
search funds dedicated to such lines would be of great value, until 
such time as the public and public institutions are fully alive to the 
need for such work. 

There is a real need for many people to devote their energies to 
the development of compact, forceful, and convincing ways of show- 
ing the benefits of wild-life administration and protection. As 
many brains with different viewpoints attack the problems of devel- 
oping our wild-life resources, solutions will be produced for prob- 
lems that now appear quite beyond us, and when the biologists and 
wild-life administrators have joined forces, we can expect a new era 
for proper handling of the important natural resources that hitherto 
have suffered so seriously from indifference and ignorance. 

SUMMARY 

1. There has been extensive depletion and in some cases extinction 
of valuable or interesting forms of vertebrate animals. 

2. There is need for increasing the wild life supply for : 

a. Recreational uses. 
h. Commercialization. 

3. The supply can be increased by proper administration or wild 
animal husbandry on lands and water now producing scanty or no 
crops. 

4. Proper administration necessitates work by competent natu- 
ralists to: 

a. Ascertain existing conditions. 

h. Plan steps for improving conditions. 

c. Submit their findings and plans to those in a position to 

facilitate their execution. 

d. Educate the public on the subject to the end of obtaining 

its full cooperation in improved wild-life production.

THE NESTING HABITS OF WAGLER'S OROPENDOLA ON 
BARRO COLORADO ISLAND ^ 



By Frank M. Chapman 



[With 8 Plates] 
INTRODUCTION 

The field studies on which this paper is based were made at the 
station of the Institute for Research in Tropical America, on Barro 
Colorado Island. Canal Zone, Panama. They cover the grreator part 
of three nesting seasons, and the period immediately preceding them, 
as follows: (1) December 27, 1925, to February 20, 1926; (2) De- 
cember 22, 192G. to April 2, 1927; (3) December 22, 1927, to April 1, 
1928. During tlie first season, only part of my time was given to 
this work; the second and third seasons it was my chief occupation. 

The colony of birds under investigation nested in a sand-box tree 
{Ilura crepitans) growing about 100 feet from the northerly corner 
of the institute's main building; a situation favorable for continuous 
observation of the birds from the time of their first appearance in 
the morning until they retired in the evening. On the other hand, 
the nature of the nesting sites prohibited examination of the contents 
of the nests in situ and the only specimens of nests, eggs, or young 
obtained were the few that fell through the accidental breaking of 
the limbs to which the nests were attached. These gave a limited 
amount of data with wliicli to check conclusions based on observations 
made from a distance. 

In 1924, when the institute's station was established on Barro Colo- 
radf), a colony of oropendolas occupied a tree about 100 feet from tho 
one now used. On June 2G, 1925, possibly because it was deprived of 
the protection of the trees that had grown near it, this tree fell before 
the wind. It contained 57 nests. The following nesting season the 
I)irds selected the tree now used. The present tree, therefore, was 
apparently chosen because of its proximity to the one which fell, 
rather than for its special fitness in affording suitable nesting sites. 
It is a sand-box tree 132 feet in height, growing from near the bottom 
of a steep slope about 30 feet below the level on which the laboratory

History. Vol. LVIII.

348 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

stands. The lowest nests were about 100 feet above the base of the 
tree, the highest about 20 feet below its top. The nearest nests to 
our viewpoint at the laboratory level were distant about 80 feet. 
This statement is of interest chiefly from the standpoint of the pho- 
tographer. With an elaborate equipment, including lenses up to 23 
inches in focal length, the distance, a background of leaves, the com- 
paratively small size and dark colors of the birds, prevented me from 
securing adequate photographs of them. 

The conditions under which the birds were watched were far more 
satisfactory. My observation post was the open space beneath my 
house situated 15 feet higher than the laboratory, and about 100 yards 
from the tree in which the oropendolas nested. Seated in a camp 
chair with a desk board across its arms, and using a 24-power binocu- 
lar mounted on a tripod, the birds, wholly unaware of my presence, 
seemed to be within reach of my hand. Every detail of their move- 
ments, even to the motion of the tongue when calling, could be seen 
clearly and with such ease that I could observe and record their 
actions for hours at a sitting without fatigue. I did not acquire this 
high-power glass until the second season. Its lack in 1925-26, when 
an 8-power glass was used from the laboratory level, greatly detracted 
from the value of that season's work. 

Diagrams were made showing the relative position of the nests. 
Each one was numbered and its history, as far as possible, carefully 
recorded. When last observed, the colony of 1926 contained 39 
nests; that of 1927, 29 nests. In 1928, 16 nests were built, but for 
various reasons, as recounted beyond, all were deserted apparently 
before eggs were laid, and the colony was abandoned. 

It is a significant comment on our lack of knowledge of the 
habits of troj)ical American birds that, although by size, voice, and 
nests the oropendolas and caciques are among the best known birds 
of that region, their life histories are as yet unwritten. One finds 
short descriptions of their loud notes and the postures of the male 
when calling, of the appearance and, in some few cases, structure 
and contents of their nests. There are also several records of 
parasitism by Cassidix oryzivora^ but all the statements made are 
based on casual or brief observations and no definite, continuous 
study of any member of the group has apparently been made. 

The oropendolas offer, however, an exceptionally interesting sub- 
ject for the field student. If the nature of the nesting site prohibits 
close examination of the nest in situ, it at least gives an admirable 
view of the colony as a unit and hence of the group activities of 
its members. The movements of the individual may also be closely 
followed and the colonial habits of the species enable one to observe 
a number of birds at the same time and under similar conditions. 



NESTING HABITS OF OROPENDOLA CHAPMAN 349 

Thus, one can more readily distinguish normal from exceptional 
habits. While I hope that my observations have covered a long 
enough period to reveal the more fundamental facts in the home 
life of Zarhy^nchus^ it must be remembered that they relate to but 
one colony of these birds. They should be regarded, therefore, 
merely as the starting point for a further study of this species and 
of other members of the oropenilola-cacique group. 

KELATlONKUirS 

ZarJiyncIius wayJeri is a member of the group* of icterine birds 
known as oropendolas. * With the caciques * they are placed by 
Sclater in a subfamily, Cassicinae, of tlie family Icteridae, a dis- 
tinction not currently recognized.' 

So far as tlie records and my own experience" go, all these birds 
nest in colonies, build pensile nests, and nest during the dry season. 
The great age of these groups is indicated by the marked structural 
dilTerences existing between certain of the genera which compose 
them, and we may assume at least a corresponding age for those 
nesting habits which they possess in conmion. 

Zarhynchus u'tf^/fW inhabits the humid tropical zone from southern 
Mexico to western Ecuador. In Colombia it is known only in the 
Colombian-Pacific fauna. Specimens from the northern part of this 
range (Guatemala and probably northern Honduras northward) 
average slightly smaller and are somewhat darker. They represent 
the rai.e known as Zarhynchus wagJeri mexlcanus. Combining char- 
acters of the most unlike members of the group, it is diilicult to say 
to which Zarhynchus is most closely related. As with Clypeicterua 
and Ocyalus the maxilla is expanded into a broad frontal shield cov- 
ering the forehead ; the wings are even more pointed, the outer pri- 
maries more incised than in the latter; it dilfers from both these 
genera and agrees with the remaining members of the group in pos- 
sessing occipital plumes, which are as highly developed as in Ostinops 
decwinanus. In general color it is also nearest to that species and 
this resemblance, in connection with the fact that the ranges of the 
two species meet only in northwestern Colombia and in Panama, may 
possess some significance.

350 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 

In view of the fact that the subtropical and hence, presumably, 
more recently evolved oropendolas ^ have a yellow band or marks at 
the base of the maxilla, it is noteworthy that two young Zarhynolms 
taken from fallen nests on Barro Colorado, June 26, 1925, and April 
1, 1927, respectively, and a young female with half-gi'own tail taken 
in eastern Panama, May 27, all have well-marked yellow, supraloral 
marks. 

Chiefly for the purpose of affording a basis for comparison of the 
sexes I append a brief description of Zarhynchus. 

Male. — Head, neck all around, throat and upper breast seal-brown ; upper back 
and wings glossy black ; lower back and rump and upper tail-coverts chestnut ; 
tail bright yellow, the two central feathers and outer webs of the outer pair 
black ; sides seal-brown shading through the flanks and ventral region to chest- 
nut lower tail-coverts. Feathers at the base of the frontal shield elongate, those 
in the center of the occiput reaching an average length of 50 mm. and with a 
basal width of about 2 mm. ; two outer primaries incised or narrowed near their 
ends ; bill large, heavy, and sharply pointed, the maxiUa expanded over the en- 
tire forehead as a broad, rounded elevated shield. Length (skin), 350; wing, 
215; tail, 130; culmen, 68; greatest width of frontal shield, 21 mm. 

Female. — Differs from the male chiefly in her smaller size. The black of the 
body is less extensive and less glossy but this difference is too slight to be notice- 
able in life. The bill is much smaller, its frontal development less pronounced, 
the frontal crest shorter and of fewer feathers ; and the primaries are only 
slightly incised. In flight, the radiation of the ends of the primaries is less pro- 
nounced and this character, the absence of sound when flying, and smaller size 
are the characters which in life distinguish the female from the male. Length 
(skin), 268; wing, 153; tail, 102; culmen, 51; greatest width of frontal shield, 
16 mm. 

SEASONAL MOVEMENTS 

In a broad sense Zarhynchus wagleri is a resident, nonmigratory 
species. Studied locally and intensively, on Barro Colorado, at 
least, it is nonresident and migratory. It appears at its breeding 
station with remarkable regularity and at the conclusion of the nest- 
ing season leaves it. While breeding, all its wants are supplied in 
the forest near its home; at this time it probably rarely goes more 
than 400 yards from its nest tree. The extent of its wanderings at 
other times of the year is unknown, but its appearance within the 
nesting territory during the nonbreeding season is purely casual. 

While Zarhynchus breeds during the dry season, the date when it 
begins to nest is not closely dependent on the cessation of rain. There 
has been much variation in the date on which the wet season may be 
said to have ended and the dry begun on Barro Colorado during the 
three years the oropendolas have been under observation, as the ap- 
pended data from the laboratory rain-gage show. 

As for temperature, it varies so little during the year that it prob- 
ably plays no part in determining the season when birds nest.

Possibly this is one of the reasons, perhaps the chief reason, why birds 
in the tropics nc^t tliroufrhout the year. The mean temperature for 
July in Panama is 81.1 ; for February, 80.8°; a difference of only 
three-tenths of a degree. Comparison of the mean temperatures on 
Barro Colorado for December and January of the three years covered 
by my studies of ZarJn/nchus shows a sli«:;ht decrease in the second 
month the first year, a negligible increase in the remaining two. The 
data follow :

■ Zarhynchiu began to build nests. 



The end of the wet season, therefore, varied from December 6 in 
1925 to at least January 12, in 1927. That this variation was not 
reflected in the dates when the oropendolas began to nest will be se«n 
from the following data : 



352 ANNUAL KEPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

Dates at which Zarhynchus wagleri began to nest at Barro Colo- 
rado Laboratory, 1926-1928:8 

1926 Nesting began January 8 

1927 Nesting began January 8 

1928 Nesting began January 2 

This remarkable periodicity indicates the regularity of the annual 
physiological cycle of the species. While in the main coincident 
with the dry season the birds' exact nesting period does not appear to 
be affected by the annual fluctuations in the date when the wet season 
ends, but rather is governed by those sexual changes which mark the 
approach of the season of reproduction. They prompt the birds to 
go, we may say to migrate, to the nesting tree. The extent of the 
migration we do not know. The birds may spend their lives within 
a radius of not more than a mile or two from the place of their birth. 
The significant fact is that the journey to their nesting range is 
begun in response to a periodically recurring physiological condition, 
that it is made regularly to a definite place, presumably before 
visited, and that as such it is fundamentally as true an example of 
migration as though it were made from the South Temperate to the 
North Temperate Zone. 

The case is paralleled by the return of tropical sea birds to their 
nesting grounds situated within the limits of their winter wander- 
ings, to which I long ago called attention in a paper ^ designed to 
show that primarily bird migration was, and is, induced by those 
developments in the sexual organs which precede the season of re- 
production. Hence it follows that if because of sterility or im- 
maturity this development does not occur, the bird in which it is 
lacking may remain in its winter quarters throughout the nesting 
season.^" 

The members of the laboratory colony do not all begin nesting at 
the same time. Just as with migrants to the Temperate Zone, there 
are late arrivals. Thus in 1926 new nests were begun as late as 
February 11, in 1927 on February 13, and 1928 on February T. 

Short visits are paid to the nest tree some days before nest building 
actually begins. In the season of 1926 I made no record of such visits. 
The following year I reached the island on December 22, 1926, and 
the appended observations were recorded before January 8, 1927, 
when nest building began.

NESTING HABITS OF OROPENDOLA CHAPMAN 353 

SEASON OF 1020-27 

December 23. Two males call in the tree In the early morning and then soon 
depart. 

December 24. No birds seen In the tree; one hoard in the distance. 

December 29. Three reported but sex not stated. 

Dect'uil)er 30. A male calls at 7.15 a. m. and later one female visits the tree. 

Deceml)er 31. A male calls In the early morning and several females come 
for a short time later. 

January 1, 1927. One male and one female came. 

January li. One bird heard in the distance. 

January 3-^. Observer absent. 

January 6. Zarhynchus shows a Rmup interest in the nest tree. First came a 
male witii 4 femali's, then 2 males with 8 females. The first group left with 
the male, in the second, the 2 males went off together while, later, the 8 females 
flew off in another direction. Nothing is decided and no actual construction 
has begun. The birds are site hunting and follow each other closely. When 
1 female goes to inspect a new limb all the others follow her. There was one 
combat between 2 of them; at 9 a. m. all the birds had left the tree for 
the day. 

January 7. At 8 a. m. 2 males and 3 females came to the nest tree for a 
short stay, the females following each other about. At 8.30, 2 males flew over 
alone ; they lit in the forest and called. Three males in the tree call ; no females 
come. A little later there were 8 females and 1 male in the tree. The females 
examined renrains of old nests and soon left together. 

January 8. Nest building began. 

SEASON or 1927-28 

In the nesting season of 1927-28, I reached the island on Decem- 
ber 22. 1927, and my notes, until the birds began to build, are as 
follows : 

December 22-25, 1927. No oropeudolas seen. 

December 26. At 8.30 a. m. a male calls a few times and leaves. 

December 27. No birds seen in nest tree; one heard in the distance. 

December 28. Male visits tree and calls at 6.20 and 8.20 a. m. Heard later 
in the distance but not seen in the tree again. 

December 29. At 7.30 a. m. 2 males call in the tree. Later 3 females, act- 
ing as a unit, fly from place to place prospecting. Grapple and whirl while 
fighting, once. A male in the tree but. as usual, they ignore him. 

December 30. Two females prospect together. A male calls, definitely ad- 
dressing them and thus beginning his prolonged courtship. 

December 31. Observer absent. 

January 1, 1928. Two females worked on an old foundation, and a male 
called vigorously. 

January 2. Nest building began. 

It will thus be seen that preliminary visits are paid the nest tree 
some days before nesting actually begins. 

THE QUESTION OF A SECOND BROOD 

The nesting season of Zurhynchu.^ is so closely associated witli the 
dry season that it is difficult to believe that they nest also in the 
wet season. Nevertheless, the facts indicate that at least some birds 



354 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

breed after the rains begin, though whether their activities repre- 
sent an actual second breeding season or are individual I am unable 
to say. I, myself, have not been on Barro Colorado between April 2 
and December 22 and for the following observations, made during 
this period, I am indebted chiefly to Dr. J. Van Tyne of the 
University of Michigan. 

Dr. Van Tyne writes that only one of the 57 nests in the tree 
that fell on June 26, 1925, contained anything. This nest held 
two nestlings nearly ready to fly. A male collected on this date 
had testes measuring 17 millimeters in length. 

On July 8, 1925, 43 nests were counted in the oropendola colony 
situated about 400 yards from the laboratory; 8 or 10 birds were 
present and at least 3 or 4 nests were in use. A male collected at 
this colony on July 9 had testes measuring 19 millimeters in length. 

In 1927, after my departure on April 2, Dr. Van Tyne reports 
that on April 5 he saw young fed for the last time in nests that 
had been begun on January 8 and adds the following observations : 

April 5. Noticed two females fighting over what seems to be a prospective 
nest site somewhat to the right of any of the present nests. 

April 9. Returning this afternoon from Panama City (Pearl Island trip) 
I find a whole group (I count a dozen) of new nests being started. The 
group is situated immediately to the right of and somewhat lower than the 
old right-hand group of nests. One nest is well along (one-third length) and 
the rest merely started. I have seen no bird yet using any of the five marked 
(old) nests. I suppose they are empty by now. Are not the new nests being 
built for second broods? 

April 11. The nest building is progressing rapidly. There are now 19 nests 
under construction and more apparently being started. The males have been 
much more noisy since this new nest building began. Also the false-alarm 
business (i.e., cackle and dive for safety) has been much more frequent. 
Leffotiis and Cacicus are much in evidence. Legatus looks into some of the 
old nests but does not enter. Cacicus merely sits around and sings. 

April 12. I can now count 22 new nests. Only about four of the old nests 
seem to be still occupied. The females that are building are continually 
stealing nesting material from each other and from old nests. 

April 14. There are 10 of the nests which are now completed as far as 
the outside is concerned — they continue to work inside. All of these nests 
are strikingly shorter than the first brood nest. Most of them are barely a 
foot long. 

April 19. At 6 a. m. (8 minutes before sunrise) the oropendolas were nearly 
all at their nests about to begin work. 6.30 p. m. none of the females are roost- 
ing in the nests yet. But there are several of the old nests still in use. 

April 21. Only 18 of the new group of nests appear to be under active con- 
struction. Others seem to have stopped entirely and are probably discarded. 
To-day 6 new nests were started in a separate group about half-way between the 
two old groups of nests and some 10 feet lower. All are close together on the 
same branch. Why do they do things by groups like this? What is this 
smaller group within a nesting colony? 

On April 26 the wet season began — 3.78 inches rain. Rain continued — averag- 
ing nearly an inch a day. This seems to have stopped the oropendolas. They

Ill Jul}', 19:28, Mr. Zetok rt-porti'd to nu' tlio presence of 11 oropen- 
dolii nests in a lar«j;e oiit>(an(liM<^ tree near the observatory on tlie 
siinnnit of the ishiiuh These nests hail not hcen hiiilt when I h-ft the 
island on Ajjiil i2, nor were the birds known to nest in these trees at 
any previous time. Mr. Jay A. Weber, who was on Barro C(d<jrado 
from July 22 to August 10, li)28, at my request, made repeated ob- 
servations of these nests and he reports that no oro[)endolas were seen 
near them or iiuleed on the islaml (hirin<.^ his stay. 

Possibly these nests were biiih in April before the rainy season 
began, by the birds that had been prevented from nesting in the 
sand-box tree at the laboratory. On the other hand, taken in con- 
nection with Dr. Van Tyne's observations, recorded above, this late 
building may imlicate a regular attemi)t at the production of a 
second brood. 

VOICE 

The notes of Zarhijnchus are loud, varied and frequently uttered. 
Those uttered by both sexes are (1) the characteristic blackbird 
''chuck" or "chut," which is apparently a location call or conversa- 
tional note, and its varying tone doubtless conveys varjung mean- 
ings; (2) a " cack-cack " development of the call note which ex- 
presses suspicion and alarm. This is given by the male more fre- 
quently than by the female whose voice joins that of the male in the 
presence of actual or suspected danger, as described beyond. The 
call is then louder, uttered more rapidly and resembles the sound 
produced by a small watchman's rattle, or "matraca"; (3) a whin- 
ing call which seems to be a note of combat, real or threatened. 
This is given by tiie males when two or more at close quarters are 
courting the same female, and by the females when in the contest for 
a nest site the}' grapple and whirl downwards. The females also 
sometimes whine just after entering the nest, but the significance 
of the note is then not apparent. 

The notes peculiar to each sex are the female's gasping '' wee- 
chuck-chuck-chuck," a low husky gurgle which one bird addresses to 
another in disputes over the nesting site, and the male's announce- 
ment of presence and his song. I distinguish between these two 
calls of the male, but lack of experience with tlie species in the non- 
breeding season makes the distinction an arbitrary one. 

I at once confess my inability to transcribe the male's calls either 
by notation or syllabification, and faitli in my ])ower to convey even 
an approximate idea of them is weakened by the fact that, for the 



356 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

greater part, descriptions written one year mean little or nothing the 
next! What I have termed the announcement of presence call is 
uttered before courtship begins, when, for example, the male is alone 
in the nest tree. I write it as " agua " or " waco " or " chap-pa- 
qua"; "hope you choke." ^^ The tone is loud, deep, liquid, and 
gurgling and the call is usually interspersed with " chucks." The 
courtship, or " crash " call, which I consider the male's real song, 
begins with the one just described and adds a sputtering crackle 
ending in an explosive crash. In my notes I have also termed this 
remarkable production a sputtering, masticatory ejaculation. The 
polysyllables help convey some idea of its character. This call, as 
described under courtship, is given with obvious muscular effort. 
It can, indeed, be seen coming as the bird's body begins to swell 
from below upward and, rising on tiptoe, he delivers his vocal 
appeal, then sinks back deflated. Of all these themes there are 
endless variations and combinations and as the season advances 
changes occur which, while evident to the ear, are too subtle to be 
put on paper. 

WING " NOTES " 

The flight of the female is essentially noiseless, but the flight of 
the male is often accompanied by a sound, evidently produced by 
the passage of the widely radiating, emarginate outer primaries 
through the air. This sound varies in rhythm in response to the 
character of the bird's flight. It is apparently under the bird's 
control and may be withheld, when the flight of the male is as noise- 
less as that of the female. It probably has some sexual significance. 
As a rule it marks the time of the bird's wingbeat as with a loud 
"fluff, fluff, fluff," he flies steadily with even strokes or passes on 
deep, swinging loops. When the male pursues the female in court- 
ship-flight it is a loud startling, rushing roar, such as might be 
produced by the sudden violent tearing of some textile. On sev- 
eral occasions it accompanied a peculiar flight as the bird pointed 
its bill toward the ground and, with short, jerky wingbeats, pro- 
duced a staccato " plop, plop, plop." This may have been some 
form of sexual display. 

THE QUESTION OF TERRITORY 

The question of territorial rights while nesting apparently does not 
enter into the location of an oropendola colony. On Barro Colorado 
three nesting colonies of these birds are known. One is 400 yards 
from the laobratory colon}'^, the other nearly two miles from it in the 

" The latter phrase Is the only one that has held In my notes for two years and for this 
reason I give it. 



NESTING HABITS OF OROPENDOLA — CHAPMAN 357 

opposite direction. Birds apparently en route to the nearer colony 
sometimes stop in the laboratory tree and min«2jle with the local birds 
without their presence bein<r questioned. 

Nor do «i;roups within the colony appear to be concerned by the 
question of boundaries. The first bird to arrive selects its p^oup loca- 
tion from the unoccupieil held, the choice bein<^ made by the females. 
Each year of my observations the first «^roup to arrive has selected a 
different location. Always, however, a situation was chosen that had 
been used before. Here the point of attachment, which is usually all 
that is left of the precedin<;j year's nest, offered an attractive place 
for the be<:;inninfj: of a new nest. 

The nests are al\va3^s built on the southerly and westerly, which is 
the leeward, side of the tree during the period of trade winds that pre- 
vail in the dry season. Here the nests receive some protection from 
the windward side of the tree, and it is probable that the birds can 
enter them more readily flying upwind than they could when flying 
down wind. 

The tree is large enough to afford sufficient space for subsequent 
groups without arousing the enmity of those already located, and I 
have seen no ill-feeling displayed between the members of different 
groups as such. Size is, indeed, to be desired in a colony, and the 
larger its population the more protection do its component individuals 
receive from their common enemies. 

It was soon evident that the birds were not monogamous, but it was 
by no means clear whether they were polygamous or promiscuous. 
The relationships of the males to one another were also to be deter- 
mined. No reference to these subjects has been found in the literature 
concerning oropendolas and caciques. 

COURTSHIP AND SEXUAL RELATIONS 

To determine the sexual or marital relations of the members of an 
oropendola colony is one of the most interesting and at the same time 
most difficult problems connected with the study^of these birds. At 
the time of my departure the colony of 1926 contained about 6 or 7 
males and 39 females; tiiat of 1927, 5 or males and 29 females; that 
of 1928 was never fully organized. In each case the number of 
females given was determined by the number of nests. Unattache<l 
females may have visited the nest tree, but they did not function as 
members of the colony. 

The opening of the nesting season is announced by the location call 
of the male, given from the nest tree, on numbers of occasions, some 
days before nesting actually begins. Females may or nuiy not be 
present at such times; however, should there be any in the tree the 
male pays no attention to them. It is not until they begin to build 
28095—31 24 



358 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

that his prolonged courtship actively begins. He then takes a post 
usually above the working females and addresses the group collec- 
tively ; or he focuses his attention on a single bird (but not always the 
same bird). Generally he perches on the nest branch above her and 
repeatedly utters the courtship or " crash " call. As the season 
advances and the period of egg deposition approaches he presses his 
suit with greater energy, and at its maximum his demonstration is 
thus described in my records of February 18, 1927 : 

The usual position of the male when addressing the female is above her, 
often on the limb to which her nest is attached or, should she be inside, at its 
entrance. From this point of vantage he leans down toward her, his blue eyes 
glare as though they would pop from their orbits, his crest feathers are elevated 
and expanded laterally, his wing tips are ci'ossed above his tail, and the fluffy 
feathers of the lower back are spread out over the edges of the inner wing 
quills. This attitude is invariably accompanied by the " crash " or courtship 
call — indeed, is assumed for the purpose of uttering this call. In the delivery 
of it the bird rises on his toes, as it were, nervously flits, while slightly spread- 
ing the tail, raises the dorsal feathers, and fluffs out the body feathers chiefly 
of the flanks. The movement of the body feathers may be caused by the 
muscular exertion incident to the delivery of his notes, but the spreading of 
the back feathers seems a part of the display. When not specifically directed 
toward a female but addressed generally to a group, the bird's attitude is more 
erect, like the normal perching position, the tail is not flitted and the iJerform- 
ance is less tense, less excited. 

This muscular and vocal demonstration evokes no response from 
the female who, acting as though wholly unaware of the male's 
presence, continues without interruption her nest building and her 
journeys to and from the forest. The male may accompany her on 
these journeys or he may turn his attention to another female. 

It is not apparent that a male has any group relations or group 
rights. As many as six males have been seen courting in one group 
at the same time and they fly from group to group. At an unex- 
pectedly early date the male pursues the female in what appears to 
be a mating flight, though I have never seen it lead to mating. In 
1927 this act was first observed on January 12, four days after nest 
building began. In 1928 it occurred within the first week of building. 
On these occasions the male with a rush and a roar of wings pursues 
the female at full speed while she twists and turns and apparently 
spares no effort to evade him. Usually the birds are lost to sight 
in the forest but in every case where the flight has been watched to 
its conclusion the female alights in a tree, the male perches near her 
and the incident is closed. Frequently the pursuing male is joined 
by a second and even by a third when the affair becomes a thrilling 
exhibition of flight power not without its dramatic appeal. As the 
nesting season advanced it was observed that each male concentrated 
his attention on a certain female which he accompanied to and from 



NESTING HABITS OF OROPENDOLA — CHAPMAN 359 

the nest and that his ri^jhts appeared to be recognized by other males 
none of which disputed his claims. The male at this time did not 
rush after the female but went with her quietly, as though he were 
her accepted male. My entry of Fcbi nary 20, lUiiT, in rei^'ard to the 
owner of nest No, 5, group 1, who is later referred to in connection 
with the loss of her nest, illustrates this habit; it reads: 

Male ac-compniues female with sreut rejrularity to ami from the nest waiting 
immediately above while she is inside and leaving just after she does. She 
always leads both going and coming. Their fli^'ht is normal, there is no rush 
of pursuit, and no other male interferes. 

While waiting for the female to come out of the nest the male may 
now be silent or he may call a rather automatic call without any of 
the action and vocal ener^^y of tlie courtship period. On February 28 
and March 1 a male with a black-tipped bill was recorded regularly 
accompanying the female of nest Xo. 17, group 2, in the manner 
above described. This nest was begun February 7 and it is probable 
that the female was about to lay. 

Further evidence indicative of an understanding between the sexes 
is supplied by observations in which the female not only acknowl- 
edged the presence of the male, but apparently caressed him. Thus 
on January 27, 192G, and February 10, 11, and 22, 1927, a female 
l)erched by the side of a male, away from the nest but in the nest 
tree, was seen to pick at or stroke the male's plumage. The record 
of February 11 reads: "A female picks at the head of a male gently 
(a caress?) several times. He apparently is conscious of the atten- 
tion and welcomes it." Quoting again from the entry for February 
11: "A female perched near the place where one was observed 
yesterday rims her bill through the male's neck feathers, while he, 
with bowed head and half-open bill, seems to enjoy the proceeding." 
Again, on February 22: ''A female, in the body of the tree, caresses 
a male. Two other males come, but the female pays no attention to 
them and continues picking at the feathers of the first male. She 
then flies off witli him leaving the other males." 

Since this attention on the part of tlie female was not restricted to 
the immediate vicinity of the nest, where it could be readily observed, 
it may have been indulged in far more frequently than my records 
show. Together with the regular association of a male and a female 
for a short time it leads to the conclusion that at least during the 
period when the ova require fertilization a male and a female asso- 
ciate as a pair. 

After incubation begins the male shows no further interest in the 
female. In this connection my entry for February 22, 1027, reads: 
" No. 5, group 1, is the onl}' bird of the seven in the group that 
attracts a male, from which I conclude that the other six have laid-" 



360 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

And on February 23, I find this: "No males in group 1 to-day. 
Their attention is devoted to the builders in group 2." February 28 
I quote further : " No males have been seen in group 1 since I can 
remember." 

Although the males are such ardent and persistent wooers, they 
exhibit no really pronounced sexual jealousy. Possibly its absence is 
due to the excess in the numbers of females over males. But in the 
small colony of 1928, when there were probably half as many males 
as females and the competition for a mate should have been keener 
than in the preceding years, no change was observed in the relations 
of the males to one another. When several males (I have seen four) 
court the same female simultaneously the situation is apparently 
threatening. The birds whine excitedly and an attack seems im- 
minent but at the worst it results in a pursuit in which one bird 
retreats slowly before another, flying from limb to limb but not 
usually leaving the nest tree. No notes are uttered — the whine seems 
to be the only battle cry — there is no resistance and hence no fighting, 
and the whole affair is quiet and dignified. On one occasion (Janu- 
ary 26, 1927) one male drove a second from perch to perch and finally 
out of the nest tree, then out of three other trees, and finally into the 
forest where they were lost to view, but it was done quietly and 
slowly. It is only the females that fight. 

THE SITE 

In the tree now occupied by the laboratory colony, the nest site 
is a single terminal, "dripping" or downward pointing branch or 
twig about the thickness of a lead pencil. Nests preserved from 
the tree that fell show that its terminal branches had an upward 
curve, creating, therefore, a short horizontal section at the turn 
which offered a more favorable place of attachment for the nest 
than is given by the branches of the tree now occupied. In any 
event, the site should permit the nest to swing free without danger 
of entanglements with near-by limbs even when, as sometimes hap- 
pens, it is blown to an almost horizontal position. 

If the birds of a group arrive and work together they usually 
build nests as near to one another as the available sites permit. The 
selection of a site may be made at once and peacefully, it may cause 
the display of some animosity accompanied by actual fighting, or 
it may be the occasion of a remarkable performance extending over 
several days. In the first instance, nest building proceeds at once 
without friction and it is possible that these birds have been asso- 
ciated before. In the second instance the birds grapple claw to 
claw and, fighting with their bills, whirl downward like a single 
bird with set wings extended. When within 10 to 20 feet of the 



NESTING HABITS OF OROPENDOLA — CHAPMAN 361 

earth they separate, fly to the nearest perch and sit there quietly for 
a few seconds side by side. Then they usually return to the nest 
site. These conflicts may be repeated from time to time but cease 
when nest buildin«^ is under way and right to the possession of a 
site is acknowledged. 

An extreme illustration of the desire for close companionship 
while nesting occurred in the season of 1928. On January iil two 
females began to build nests Nos. 3 and 4 of group 2. The birds 
were on friendly terms, selected sites not more than a foot apart, 
and proceeded quietly with their work. On February 3, when the 
nests were well started, they were joined by two more females who 
insisted on aiding them in the construction of their nests. I quote 
from my journal: 

Neet No. 3 is the more advanced and tlie newcomer confines her efforts to 
the upper or attachment portion where she is permitted to work by the owner. 
No. 4 has room fur only one worker and every attempt on the part of the 
volunteer to assi.st is at once resented by the owner. The birds then lock grips 
and wliirl downward lighting and squealing as they fall. An occasional float- 
ing feather shows that these aerial combats are not mere matters of form. 
For the greater part of the time the two birds sit motionless, with bills half 
open glaring fixedly into space; No. 4 on her nest, the would-be helper on a 
branch distant only a few inches. For at least 10 minutes they hold this 
pose then spring at each other and, grappling, whirl downward. 

The first-named volunteer finally built a complete nest, using the 
attachment of No. 3 for her foundation, w^hile the one who for some 
time persisted in her efl'orts to assist the builder of No. 4, finally 
built a nest of her own from an immediately adjoining branch. 

In some cases, however, the matter of site ownership is not so 
quickly settled, when the actions of the builder of nest No. 4 and her 
rejected assistant developed the singular performance to which I have 
before referred. The mo.st ])ionounced and prolonged dispute of tliis 
nature was made by two females in group 2, of the 1927 nesting sea- 
son. These birds were first observed at 7.35 on the morning of Janu- 
iwy 19, facing one another on terminal site twigs about 1 foot apart. 
One went through the motions of the male's " crash " call repeatedly. 
I could see its bill moved but could hear no sound. The other, with 
liead bowed, listened. Finally they grappled and fell fighting. The 
struggle thus begun lasted for five days before each bird was recon- 
ciled to the presence of the other, and at the end of this time each 
began building on its own site. Sometimes one, sometimes the other. 
" iield the floor,"' but they never both called together and the bird 
addressed, ajjparently oblivious of all else, gave her entire attention 
to tiie speaker. Seen at such times, one woidd assume that the calling 
bird was a courting male, the silent one a receptive female, but this 
illusion would be destroyed when the listening bird would claim the 
privileges of the floor and speak as vigorously as her j)rotagonist, 



362 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

the argument often ending in a grapple and fight as they whirled 
downward. I quote from my journal records of illustrative observa- 
tions : 

January 20, 7.55 a. m. Two females face each other, bills about 3 inches 
apart and call alternately; crests erect. 

January 21, 9.44 a. m. Nos. 1 and 2, group 2, at same sites as yesterday. No. 
2 assumes a downcast (listening) pose. No. 1 addresses her. Both now facing 
each other only 8 inches apart ; a laughable performance, crests arising as 
they speak. (This was continued until 10 a. m. when both picked at old 
nesting material.) 

January 22. No. 1, perched above No. 2, who is on her site, calls frequently, 
addressing No. 2 below, who, with her head bowed in the usual pose, eyes half- 
closed, bill sometimes partly open, apparently listens intently to the notes No. 
1 is practically pouring into her ear. A male alights on the limb above, and 
shakes it so that Nos. 1 and 2 lose their balance. No. 1 falls on No. 2, they 
grapple and whirl downward, but return at once and assume their former poses 
and actions. 

January 24, 7.20 a. m. Nos. 1 and 2 still at it; the form of approach this 
morning being the statement and counter statement. They never call together 
but one follows the other and I can hear the husky gurgle of both. 

On this date the discussion closed, and although there had been 
some attempt at nest building, it was not until January 25 that work 
Avas definitely begun. It then appeared, as will be shown later, that 
both these birds were inexperienced builders. Possibly they were 
building their first nest and hence had been selecting their first site. 
Several other couples in group 2, 1927, acted as did Nos. 1 and 2, but 
in no other instance was the dispute so prolonged. This group was 
not definitely organized and seemed to be composed largely of indi- 
viduals who had not before been associated. 

NEST BUILDING 

When the nest building instincts are fully developed the birds work 
regularly and persistently giving the greater part of each day to their 
task. During the building season there is a variation of only about 
five minutes in the time of the sunrise (6.35-6.40) and correspond- 
ingly little variation in the birds' working hours. In January, with 
clock-like regularity, one or more males call from the nest tree at 
from 6.30 to 6.35 a. m. and 20 to 30 minutes later the females arrive 
and begin their day's labors. For the succeeding four hours they are 
steadily employed in gathering material and using it. They receive 
no aid whatever from the male either in securing material or build- 
ing. He, however, is almost constantly with them, both while they 
collect building material and while in the nest tree, and his unremit- 
ting attentions and frequently uttered calls may prove a source of 
encouragement. 

Toward midday the birds usually retire to the forest and the nest 
tree is deserted. In the early afternoon work is resumed and con- 



NESTING HABITS OF OROPENDOLA — CHAPMAN 363 

tinned nntil abont half-past live o'clock when the birds in a body go 
to the forest, generally taking the same dii-ection, perhaps to a 
regularly frequented roost. From this schedule there is, of course, 
more or less variation, and as the season advances the birds retire 
later. 

Com|)aratively few nests survive tiie rainy season and those that 
do remain are frayed and raggeil. A new nest, therefore, is built 
each year. On one occasion, after a rain, a bird was seen to use 
some wet, and hence weavable, material from an old nest in the con- 
struction of its home, but, as a rule, only the attachment of the pre- 
ceding year's nest enters into the building of the new one. 

Strong but pliable material is recjuired by the weaver. A green 
tendril 8 to 10 inches long is much used, particularly in the early 
stages of the work. This, like twine, can be wrapped about a limb 
many times, forming, in effect, the foundation of the nest bag. Air 
rootlets, tine strips of bark, tilamentous blossoms, plant fibers, string- 
like strips from the stem of Monstera torn off by the strong, service- 
able bill of the bird, what resemble weed stalks (but no twigs) form 
the greater part of the nest bags examined. I use the term "nest 
bag," for the pensile structures seen hanging from the nest tree are 
merely the receptacles for the nest proper. This is composed of 
nearly a hatful of fragments of soft leaves and bark and short pieces 
of fiber loosely placed, not packed or woven, at the bulbous bottom 
of the woven bag. In the old, as well as freshly fallen, nests that 
I have examined this material is not detinitel}' shaped into a circular 
nest with a depressed center and surrounding walls, but is a formless 
l)ed probably designed to prevent the eggs from rolling about and 
breaking when the nest bag is violently blown about by the strong 
trade winds of the dry season. 

All the nesting material, except that which may be stolen from a 
neighboring nest, is secured in the immediately adjoining forest, 
usually within sight of the nest tree. 

In well-organized colonies in which the community spirit is de- 
veloped, the females, when building, usually leave the nest tree to 
collect material, in a body, and they may be seen gathering it to- 
gether in the same tree. Material dropped when building is not 
abandoned, but by a graceful swoop is caught in the air, the 
retriever returning with it to the nest. 

Building birds often take material from another bird's nest either 
in their own or an adjoining group. Some birds, indeed, are chronic 
robbers and steal a large part of their material. Slovenly builders 
are more apt to be robbed than those that leave no loose and tempting 
ends about their structure. A poor builder is often, therefore, 
heavily handicapped, for a day's work may be undone in a short 
time by her thieving neighbors. Birds that do not work continuously 



364 ANNUAL. REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

and which consequently leave their nests unprotected are frequently 
robbed. There is a limit, however, beyond which it does not pay 
to try to secure material from another bird's nest. Only the looser, 
partly woven ends may be easily taken. After that the robber may 
tug and pull, adding her weight to her strength but she gets little 
or nothing for her labor. 

On one occasion a long fiber streaming from the bill of a returning 
female was grasped by three other females and, becoming entangled 
in a limb, was lost to all of them. Thoroughly to understand the 
method by which a nest is constructed would require closer inspec- 
tion, and from every side, than I have been able to give, even with 
the aid of a high-power glass. The foundation of the nest is laid 
by wrapping long rootlets, tendrils, or fiber about the supporting 
limb until it is well covered. To this is woven additional material 
forming a flat piece or apron, 10 or 12 inches in length, its extent 
depending in part on the nature of the attachment. When the sup- 
porting limb is more or less horizontal the apron takes shape more 
readily than when it is perpendicular. Four nests preserved from 
the tree that was occupied when the laboratory was established, and 
that subsequently fell, are attached to horizontal limbs and have broad 
bases or aprons. But the nest tree now occupied, as I have before 
remarked, offers, as a rule, perpendicular limbs from which an apron 
is less easily woven. Apparently, therefore, the present tree is less 
adapted to the needs of Zarhynchus than the one that fell, its prox- 
imity to the former site having induced the birds to occupy it in 
spite of its unsuitability. Possibly for this reason the colony does 
not grow and in time the tree may be abandoned. 

Under the normal method of procedure when the apron or base 
of the nest is finished an opening or hole three or four inches in 
diameter is made in its lower part and the base of the ring or loop 
thus formed becomes the lip of the entrance to the nest. This ia 
on one side and usually extends from the lip or rim of the opening 
to the top, or place of the nest's attachment. The formation of 
this opening is evidently the most difficult part of nest construction. 
Its base is usually strengthened by the use of additional material and 
closer weaving. 

In this loop or ring the bird stands working first above and then 
below. From this stage downward she works inside the lengthening 
bag which is evidently formed about her body as a mold, until the 
lower part of the nest is reached when the outline bulges in response 
to the increased diameter needed for the reception of the true nest. 
The weaving here is a little closer and the walls of the nest thicker. 

Even when the long sack is nearly completed, but is still open be- 
low, the builder leaves and enters the nest by way of the door. 
Entrance is made on the wing with, as the nest is approached, a 



NESTING HABITS OF OROPENDOLA — CHAPMAN 365 

slight downward dip followed by an ahnijit upward turn which 
serves to check the speed of the bird's fli<rht. The bird thus flies 
into its nest without pausinjr on the threshold. The re<rularity with 
which this procedure is followed is an indication of its importance. 
"With its back exposed and head concealed a bird, perched at the 
nest openiui; and lookinjr in, would evidently be at the mercy of a 
foe from without, and this point of exposure is, therefore, passed 
as quickly as possible. When leaving the nest, however, the posi- 
tion and the conditions are reversed and the bird often perches in 
its doorway and leisilrely surveys the surroundings. 

The use of the nest opening from the day it is available trains 
the bird's sense of location. I have never knowingly seen a bird 
make the mistake of entering the wrong nest, even when, as is often 
the case, several are near together. Under normal conditions it is, 
indeed, rare for a bird to exhibit the slightest hesitation in finding 
her own doorway. Changes, however, may occur which for a mo- 
ment tend to confuse it. For example, when the nests swing widely 
in a high wind not only are the}' in motion but the actual position 
of the opening is altered and both factors cause the returning bird 
to hover for a second or two before slipping into the nest. 

A more pronounced case of this nature occurred through the 
breaking of one of the limbs to which nest No. 5, group 1, 1927, 
was attached. The nest now half turned around and then s])un 
back, the entrance, therefore, being first on one side then on the 
other. The owner was at first confused but soon adapted herself 
to tlie new situation though she was usually forced to discover 
the exact position of the nest opening on each return. 

Once the bird begins to work inside, little can be seen of her while 
building until she begins to close the nest at the bottom. Then her 
bill may be observed actively thrusting and pulling as she hangs 
heatl downward within. 

There is wide variation in the nest-building ability of different 
birds. Tliis is probably in part individual, but it is doubtless also a 
mea.sure of the extent to which their in.stinct has been developed by 
experience. Some birds evidently know exactly what they want to 
do and work rapidly and effectively; others show but little interest in 
their work and seem at a loss to loiow how to use the material they 
have collected. 

The members of groui)s 1 and 2, of the .season of 1027, illustrated, 
respectively, these extremes. The first, as has before been stated, 
were apparently an organized group of birds that had been associ- 
ated before, and hence, presumably were more or less experienced. 
The second group was composed of birds that had not established 
communal relations and some of which, at least, seemed to be build- 
ing their first nest. 



366 ANNUAL. EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

Group 1 began building on January 8, and for that day my record 
reads : 

Seven females came back from tlie forest together bringing green tendrils. 
Some work at old, some at new sites. The first tendril is attached to the limb 
skillfully and rapidlJ^ It is put over and under, pulled here and poked there. 
They work feverishly but definitely. Their heads go over a limb with a tendril 
and then reach under it to get the end and pull it through. No needleworker 
could proceed with less hesitation. 

These birds further showed their energy and earnestness by work- 
ing in the rain. 

On January 9, my journal reads : 

A thoroughly rainy morning, with showers and thunder ; the whole sky over- 
cast. I see 12 females and 1 male in the field of my 24-power glass. The fe- 
males are using some fiber and all work furiously, about one half on old sites, 
the rest on new. There is very little confusion and each bird " sticks to its 
own knitting." * * * Tliey thrust over and pull under without apparent 
study and without waiting. Everyone seems to know exactly what she wants 
to do and goes at it like a master workman absorbed in her task. 

The same concentration and effectiveness was shown by this group 
throughout the period of construction. On January 22, the entry 
reads : 

These birds work whole-heartedly with strict attention to business, rarely 
coming into contact with one another. Sometimes a head appears through a 
nest bottom pulling vigorouslj' at a fiber here or poking in a loose end there. 
Postion is a matter of indifference. They work upside down or right side up ; 
nor do feathers of wings or tail impede their movements. The tail may be 
bent any way, the wings closed or half-spread. They are intent on only one 
thing and are not concerned with appearances. 

Compare with these extracts the following, describing the nest- 
building efforts of birds Nos. 1 and 2 of group 2. We have already 
seen that these birds devoted five days to discussion of the nest 
location before work actually began. I quote from my notes: 

January 24, 7.53 a. m. No. 1 returns with short brown fiber but doesn't seem 
to know what to do with it. After a half -da zed moment she weaves it into 
foundation * * * ; 9.05, No. 2 returns with a bill full of green tendrils but 
loses three-fourths of them. No. 1 comes with a bill full of the same kind of 
material ; they fight and she loses all of it. 

January 25, 8.14 a. m. No. 1 sits with a straw in her bill, motionless until 
8.23 when she uses it. 

January 29, 8.05 a. m. No, 2 is still trying to form an opening — the doorway — 
but it will not take shape. She pokes and pulls and weaves but apparently 
lacks suflficicnt experience to succeed. She can weave but she doesn't seem to 
know what to weave. 

January 30, 8.30. No nest in group 2 has a completed opening, and only No. 2 
has attempted to make one. All the facts observed suggest that these are 
young birds making their first attempt at nest building, in which case their 
instinct must develop slowly with experience. 

February 7. No. 1 has broken the bottom of her ring and works with wide- 
spread feet grasping each end of it. No. 2 has deepened her saucer but has not 
yet a doorway. 



NESTING HABITS OF OROPENDOLA CHAPMAN 367 

February 10. No. 1 still strangling with her ontraucc. No. 2 has completed 
hers and can now ^et insidf the be^inniuK of a ba^. 

February 14. No. 1 has brought the loose ends of her doorway together and 
Is almost concealed when at work. 

In view of these facts it is obvious that the time re<iuiietl to buiUl 
a nest depends, at least in a measure, on the skill, energy, and 
persistence of the builder. This statement would call for no qualifi- 
cation if all nests were uiade to the sauie moilel. They vary, how- 
ever, in leii«j:th and in amount of liiiin<^. It is not impo.ssible that 
when an undue amount of time has been spent on the earlier stages 
of a nest it may be brought hastily to completion because of tlie 
approaching needs of the female for a receptacle for the eggs. 
When this need does not force a completion of the task, and conse- 
quent closing of the nest bottom, the bag may be continued to the 
maximiun length. 

In the absence of examination it is impossible to say exactly how 
many days are reijuired to finish a nest. One may note the time 
when the weaving of the bag is finished and its lining begun, but it 
is not improbable that while the female is laying, or even after she 
has begun to incubate, she may add to the nest lining. 

I have, therefore, accepted as evidence indicating the completion of 
the nest its occupation at night. This is a definite, observable act and 
obviously marks an important change in the attitude of the female 
toward her home. Doubtless at or near this time the eggs are laid. 

Throughout the period of building, the females, as before stated, at 
the end of a day's work accompany the males to the forest. They 
usually go in a body, the males leading. But there comes a day when 
the growing attachment of the female for her nest is stronger than 
the impulse that induces her to follow the male to the roosting place. 
The conquest of the old habit by the new one is recorded in my entry 
for February 13, 1927 : 

To-night for the first tin>e this year the females were seen to enter the nests 
for the nijiht. There was an unusual nunib<'r of birds in the colony at 6.10. 
At about 6.15 they all flew off but returned at 6.18. Again they took flight 
leaving, however, three females who, after preening, entiTed ue.sts Nos. 1, 2, 
and 8 of group 1, respectively. 

After this event is inaugurated the gathering in the nest tree of the 
members of the colony becomes a nightly habit. Even the birds 
whose nests are not ready for occupation stay in the tree until those 
whose homes are apparently completed enter them. All sit about 
industriously preening their plumage in preparation for the night. 
At about G.15 the first female enters her nest. She is soon followed 
by otlicrs and by G.30 all who are to stay have gone to bed and the 
remainder of the group fly to the forest. 

In 1926 this habit was first observed on February 7; in 1927, on 
February 13. The 1928 colony was too much disturbed to develop it 



368 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

observably. Eecalling that nest building was begun in both the first- 
named years on January 8, it follows that in these groups of early 
builders not less than 31 days were required to build the nest bag and 
line it. I have suggested, however, that with the advance of the 
season the increased development of the ovaries may induce the 
builder to finish her work in a shorter time. For example, nest No. 
17. of group 2, 1927, begun February 7, was believed to have been 
completed in 23 days, and nest No. 13 of group 1, 1927, begun Febru- 
ary 5, in 25 days. 

Completed nests vary from 1 foot and 10 inches to 3 feet and 4 
inches in length, but the greatest diameter of all (always in the bulb- 
ous base) is 8 inches. Length, as we have seen, may depend on the 
proximity of the egg-laying period and hence is variable, but the 
diameter of that part of the bag containing the true nest is fixed by 
the size of the sitting bird and, therefore, is always essentially the 
same. 

THE EGGS 

The terminal branch to which nest No. 5, of group 1, 1927, was 
attached was broken, presumably by a strong wind, on the morning 
of March 7, and the nest fell. It contained two eggs which 
apparently constitute a full set for the species. One of the eggs 
was broken, the other measured 33 by 22 millimeters. In color it 
is pale blue with numerous irregularly shaped brownish-black marks 
varying in size from a pin point to a currant and clustering most 
thickly about the larger end. Both eggs contained embryos which 
I estimated to be about 12 or 13 days old. My records give the 
following history for this nest : It was begun January 8 and was first 
slept in February 13. On February 21 the female entered and left 
the nest 14 times between 8.33 and 9.25 a. m. February 22 she en- 
tered and left six times between 8.17 and 9.04. On both days she was 
accompanied by a male on every journey to and from the nest. The 
record for the 22d reads : " No. 5 is the only bird of the seven in 
group 1 who attracts a male, from which I conclude that the other 
six have laid." February 23 she left the nest only once between 
8.17 and 9.04 a. m. and was not accompanied by a male. This evi- 
dence suggests that she began to incubate February 23, or 12 days 
before the nest fell. I shall have something to say about the 
subsequent activities of No. 5, the owner of this fallen nest. 

Incubation in group 1, 1927, was believed to begin on February 18, 
when the owner of nest No. 2 left her nest at 9.54 and returned at 
9.59; these being her only movements during an hour's observation. 
On March 7, she carried food to the nest. On the basis of these obser- 
vations the period of incubation in this instance was 17 days. On 
March 11, this bird was seen removing excreta from the nest. 



NESTING HABITS OP OROPENDOLA — CHAPMAN 369 

THK VOILNG 

Long before the eggs hatch the male loses interest in the female 
and when the young appear they are cared for only by the female. 
In 10i>7 young were first noted on March 2 in nest No. 2 of group 1. 
On March '22 the young in this nest were first heard to call as they 
were being fed. On the 3Lst the female fed them by reaching down 
from the opening without entering the nest, and on April 1 they were 
seen at the doorway. My observations ended April 2, but it is not 
probable that the young of this nest took flight before A|)ril a-S.'-* 
On this a.ssumption the dates of the more important events in the 
liistory of this nest are as follows: Nest begun January 8. Female 
first sleeps in nest February Ki (assumed date of the completion of 
the nest). Young first noted, March 2. Probable date of flight 
of young, April 5-8 or 87-90 days from the beginning of the nest. 

The period of nearly three months between the beginning of the 
nest and flight of the young is of course shortened when less time 
is given to the construction of the nest. For example, nest No. 13, 
group 1, 1927, which, as stated above, is believed to have been built 
in 25 days, fell on April 1. It contained one well-grown young 
which would doubtless have flown in not more than a week or 63 
days after the nest was begun. 

NOTES ON THE ACTIONS OF A BIRD THAT LOST HER NEST 

As stated above, nest No. 5, group 1, 1927, containing two eggs 
about 12 days advanced, fell on the morning of March 7. The subse- 
quent behavior of the owner of this nest seems worthy of record. 
The branch to which the nest was attached broke between 7.30 and 
8.30 a. m. when I was in the forest. My observations began at 8.45 
when, to quote from my record : 

The female was seen tluttering about the vacancy left by the fall of her 
home and alighting on the neij^hboring nests Nos. 4 and 7. Two males and a 
female joined her and after a few minutes she flew west. At 9.30 she was 
again looking for her nest but soon departed and did not return for at least 
an hour, after which I was absent until evening. Between G.IO and G.30 p. m. 
she made four attempts to find her nest, perching on the branch to which it 
had been attached and examining the entrances to near-by nests; then she 
flew east t«> the forest with three otlier oropeiidolas. 

March S. A female, after looking alxmt the former postion of nest No. 5, 
flew to a perch about 20 feet below. Later a female brought new green tendrils 
to this perch and began to weave. Still later a female perched on the remain- 
ing attachment of the fallen No. 5, then at various places above and below and on 
each side, then flew down and weaved a little where the nest had just been 
started 20 feet below. This action was interjireted as indicating that the new 
nest ha<l been startol by the bird that had lost her nest and eggs the day before. 

Mardi 9. The female believed to be the owner of nest No. 5 worked a little at 
the nest .started yesterday then started a second one on the right fork of the 
same branch; net result about two scpiare Inches on No. L 

"The observations of Dr. Van Tyne Indicate that the earlier date Is the correct one. 



370 ANNUAL EEPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

March 11 (absent March 10). No 5 works casually and ineffectively but at 
three places, all within a few feet of one another. 

March 12. No. 5 was not seen. 

March 13. No. 5 not seen by me but reported by Mr. W. E. Hastings to have 
done some work. 

JIarch 14. No. 5 not observed. 

I find no further reference to this bird in my journal until March 
17 when there is the following entry : " No. 5 works at position No. 3 
for a few minutes, then disappears. She had made practically no 
progress since the first day or two." The next and last entry is 
March 28 when Mr. Hastings reported that a female attended by two 
males came to the limb on which the new nests had been started and 
did a few strokes of work. 

If I am correct in identifying the bird that began these nests with 
the one that had lost her nest 20 feet above the new position, and the 
record of March 8 seems to justify this belief, it appears that after 
devoting 36 days to nest building and approximately 12 to incuba- 
tion she could, after one day's manifestation of interest in the lost 
nest, return to that part of her annual cycle, which in the normal 
process of development had been reached when she first began to 
nest, 58 days prior to her loss. Its promptings, however, were not 
sufficiently strong and definite to enable her to complete a new nest. 

ENEMIES 

Aside from the parasitic blackbird, Cassidix, and flycatcher, Lega- 
tus, two other birds were found to attack the oropendola colony on 
Barro Colorado. Only one of these is diurnal, nevertheless the males 
are constantly on guard. It is, indeed, their duty to act as watch- 
men of the colony. While building, the females' attention is of 
necessity concentrated on their work and until they begin to weave 
inside the structure they are exposed to attack from birds of prey. 
The males, however, in spite of their almost constant wooing, are 
ever on guard and when a hawk is seen they are the first to utter the 
rapid, cackling alarm note, the females joining them in calling on 
certain occasions. This is a signal for the whole colony to dive 
precij^itately into the lower growth of the adjoining forest. 

Turkey buzzards do not, as a rule, evoke this call and generally 
the white snake-eating hawk {Leucoptemis ghieshr'echti) , a pair of 
which lived near the laboratory, was permitted to pass unchallenged. 
But at times even the appearance of these birds, more particularly 
the latter, was the occasion for an outcry and the accompanying 
downward rush to cover. Rarely a low-fljdng airplane created 
alarm. Often the warning cry is given without apparent reason 
but its cause may have been clear to the birds if unseen by me. 
Possibly also it may have shades of meaning to which human ears 
are deaf. 



NESTING HABITS OF OROPENDOLA — CHAPMAN 371 

The response of the oroj)endohis to this note is variable. At times 
they act as one bird and phinge from their nests or perches into the 
forest. I have even seen a bird when flyin<r toward her nest dod<T^e 
abruptly downward in the air when hearing the alariii. On the 
other hand, while it evidently puts the birds on tiioir «;uard, they 
may not move when hearinp; it. 

The si<j:nifit'ance of this call is undeistood not only by oropendolas 
but obviously by other species. On February 8, 1926, five toucans 
(three Pteroglossus^ two Rhampha^os piscivonis) and two caciques 
{Caciciis vlteUlnw<) that were in the nest tree dived with the oropen- 
dolas when the alarm was «]^ven. On tho followinf^ day it induced 
even a trespassing^ Cass/'d/'x to seek safety with her intended victims 
fiom a suj^posed common enemy. 

The need for a lookout and for prompt obedience to this danger 
.«:ignal was tragically illustrated on February 12, 1927. At noon on 
that day Mr. Maunsell S. Crosbv, who was standing near the nest 
tree watching the oropendolas at Avork, saw an eagle hawk {Splza-s- 
tur mclanoJeucus) drop from the sky, strike an oropendola that was 
working on her nest and bear her to a neighboring branch. The 
hawk, which was identified by Mr. Ludlow Griscom, was still stand- 
ing on its victim when a few moments later, attracted by the unusual 
outcry, I reached the tree. It soon flew off with its prey to the forest. 
This event caused tremendous excitement among the oropendolas, 
their united cries of alarm producing the effect of a loud chorus. 
They all left the tree and for the remainder of the day the colony 
was completely disorganized. 

The following day the effects of this catastrophe were still evident 
in the nervousness of the birds and the frequency with which the 
alarm call was uttered. Normally this call may be heard three or 
four times during a morning, but during two hours on the morning 
of February 13 it was given at 8.50, 8.51, 8.55, 9.04, 9.07, 9.10, 9.12, 
9.22, 9.40, 10.12, 10.15, 10.26, 10.44, and 10.50, a total of 14 times in 
two hours. Beyond two buzzards that flew over at 9.10 and 10.44, 
respectively, no cause for alarm was seen by me during this period. 
The first seven times the alarm was sounded all the birds responded 
promptly, diving to the protection of the lower growth. Later their 
reaction was not so keen and on three out of seven signals they did 
not respond. 

The incident illustrates the exposure to attack by a predatory bird 
of an oropendola working outside her nest, the need for a guard, the 
inqxtrtance of pronq>t obedience to his warning, of the quickening 
of reacti(jns through experience, and of their decline after frequ(Mit 
call has been made upf)n them. 

It might be imagined that the birds in their long nest bags swing- 
ing from the tips of slender branches were immune from attack. 



372 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

They can doubtless be reached by tree snakes, though I have no 
evidence of their being preyed on by these, or by other reptiles. 
Possibly marmosets may be able to approach them, but we have 
never known them to do so. Furthermore, any diurnal enemy 
would doubtless be subjected to attack from the sharp, strong bill 
of the female, and perhaps also of the male Zarhynchus. It is, 
however, a nocturnal winged foe that proves to be one of the most 
serious enemies of the oropendola. This statement is based on 
observations made on group 1, 1928, and recorded in my journal for 
January 25, as follows : 

Seven-thirty a. m. Some mishap has befallen group 1 (containing 8 nests) 
during the night. Nest No. 3 is hanging upwind across the lower part of 
No. 4, and has a large, round hole in its bottom, evidently made from without. 
No. 5 has a similar opening. Nos. 2 and 4 each have a small round hole in 
the side near the bottom. I showed these nests to Donate, who at once said : 
"El buho " (local name for Pulsatrix prrspicillata) and added that early one 
morning in the preceding year he had seen an owl fly from its perch in the 
dead tree adjoining the sand box tree and pick at the oropendola nests. Cer- 
tainly whatever did this work had wings. 

The owl named is seen or heard about the clearing nightly. 
Donato, our resident factotum, is a careful observer, and it is prob- 
able that his identification of the marauder is correct. All the nests 
mentioned were begun on January 2 and it is possible may have 
contained eggs though I had no record of the birds' sleeping in their 
homes. The owners of Nos. 2 and 5 returned to their homes and 
were evidently incubating as late as February 3. 

Apparently the attack of the owl or owls created a condition 
which made the remaining birds in the group more susceptible to 
persecution by Legatus and eventually the whole group site was 
abandoned. On former occasions I had seen holes an inch and a 
half in diameter at the side of the nest bag about on a level with the 
nest and supposed that they were made by the owner; but if they 
are made by the foot of an owl reaching in while clinging to the 
nest, it is evident that the home of Zarhynchus is far from 
impregnable. 

PARASITIC BIRDS 

Zarhynchus^ while nesting, is parasitized by two other birds, one 
of which, in effect a large cowbird {Cassidix), visits the colony from 
time to time to deposit its eggs, while the other, a flycatcher 
(Legatus), is a permanent resident who in seeking to gain possession 
of an oropendola nest for its own uses becomes a community aflSiiction 
of the first magnitude. 

Cassidix oryzivora. — It has long been Iniown that Cassidix 
oryzivora is parasitic on certain members of the oropendola-cacique

proup.'^ Possibly, since their ranp:es arc conterminous, it n»ay 
prove to be parasitic upon all of them. Whether it also parasitizes 
other species docs not appear to he known. 

To our scanty knowlodire of the relations between this species and 
its hosts 1 append a summary of my observations on linrro 
Colorado. 

In 1026, Cassidix was first observed on January 28; in 1927, on 
January 10, and in 1928, on January II, or respectively 20, 11 and 9 
days after the bcirinninc: of nest buildin*;. In 1926 earlier visits to 
the oropondola colony may have been overlooked for my attention 
was not then focused on these birds. From the dates mentioned 
imtil that time in each year when my observations ended, Cassidix 
was frequently seen in the Zarhynchiifi nest tree. For some periods 
my records show daily visits and at times several visits each day. 

A female is first recorded as entering]: a nest in 1926 on February 
4; in 1927, in spite of frequent attempts, one was not seen to succeed 
until February 25; and in 1928, on January 18. Since on the last- 
named date the nest entered was not completed, the bird was evi- 
dently making,' a reconnaissance. As most of my observations were 
made in the morning the greater number of my records of the pres- 
ence of Cassidix in the oropendola tree were made before noon. 
The earliest is at 7.40 a. m. but the species was seen in the colony as 
late as 6.30 p. m. 

The birds seemed to come from a distance and usually alighted at 
or near the top of the sand-box tree. Here they would remain for 
several minutes and then pass from limb to limb and along the 
limbs toward the Zarhynchus nests selecting, as a rule, those fin- 
ished or most nearly completed. The earlier visits of Cassidix ap- 
peared to be for inspection and when attacked by Zarhynchus they 
quickly retreated and soon took fliglit. Later, when their needs 
were doubtless more pressing, they persisted in their attempts to 
enter the oropendola nests sometimes succeeding in spite of the 
combined efforts of several oropendolas and the resident pair of 
Lr.gafus to prevent them. On leaving the tree they usually started 
on an extended flight, sometimes over the lake, that soon carried 
them out of sight. 

Visits from single birds or twos was the rule, more rarely three 
were observed together and on February 8, 1927, five females, the 
greatest number seen togetlier, perched in the tree top. Several at-

tempts were made b}'' single birds of this group to enter nests but 
they were prevented by Zarhynchus. Finally all left together in 
the usual long flight. 

The male Camidix was recorded on only three occasions, January 
19, 1927, February 10 and 19, 1928. On the first-named date a male 
was accompanied by three females before which he slightly expanded 
his ruff. On February 10 there were also three females with a single 
male. On February 19 there was only one female with a single male. 
The actions of these birds seemed to indicate that more than a pass- 
ing relation existed between them and I quote my description of it : 

Seven-thirty a. m. A male and female Cussidix in the top of the sand-box 
tree. The male's plumage glistens brightly and he is conspicuously the larger 
of the two. Some minutes after I discovered them the female started alone, 
circled the tree twice in a rising spiral flight, then headed east. The male 
continued preening. In about three-quarters of a minute a female alighted 
near the male and half a minute later started due east. He followed. Assum- 
ing that there was only one female, did she circle on her first flight while 
awaiting for the male to follow? Did she return because he did not? 

Cassidix is obviously recognized as a common enemy not only 
when she seeks to enter a nest, but when, early in the nesting season, 
she enters the nest tree. Not alone the bird whose nest is threatened 
but other birds in the same group, and also from other groups, join 
in attacking her; while Legatus assails at times with more zeal than 
Zarhynchus. An incident illustrating these facts is recorded in my 
journal for February 7, 1926 : 

At 4 p. m. a female Cassidix tried to enter several nests but so clumsily that 
before she discovered the combination she was driven off by a combined attack 
of several female oropendolas. Evidently, they recognized her as an enemy 
and united in communal defence without regard to the nest threatened. I 
saw a female from group 1 fly to the protection of a nest in group 3. Cassidix 
retreated to another part of the tree where she was not molested. Within 10 
minutes she made another attempt but was again defeated. Even two Legatus 
seemed to recognize this visitor as undesirable and with fluttering wings flew 
excitedly about her. At last she left the tree, a solitary outcast, followed by 
half a dozen oropendolas to the boundary of their territory. 

Several entries describe the aggressiveness of Cassidix. Thus, 
February 15, 1926, at 10.37 a. m. : " Cassidix tries to enter a nest 
in group 2 but is mobbed and driven off; she fights back" and at 
10.50 the entry reads : " Cassidix tries to enter group 3, is driven off 
by Zarhynchus; fights them in the air; Legatus joins in the attack 
as Cassidix is routed." And on February 25, 1927, at noon : " Cas- 
sidix enters two nests, staying 15 to 30 seconds in each. Two Zar- 
hynchus^ and both Legatus drive her off repeatedly, but she fights 
them as though she were defending her own nest." 

A curious performance is recorded at 8.34 a. m. on February 13, 
1927, when my notes read: "A female Cassidix displays before or 
addresses a female Zarhynchus on a new nest at the left of No. 5, 



NESTING HABITS OF OROPENDOLA CHAPMAN 375 

group 2. She draws herself up to full height, slightly expands her 
ruffs, with bill down then curls head downward until bill touches 
lower breast. Zarhynchus meanwhile cuncerned and whines slightly. 
The performance is repeated." Less marked was the action of two 
females who, on February 18, 1928, posed on a limb in the sand- 
box tree with their bills pointed upward, like boat-tail grackles. 

The probability that Cassidix is aware of the conditions existing 
in a Zarhynclius colony is indicated by the fact that after the nest- 
ing colony of lUiiS was abandoned Cajisid'ix was not seen in it. On 
February 2G my journal reads: ''Apparently not an oropendola left 
in the tree.'' On the following date this entry appears : '" Cassidix 
in group 2 examines and enters nearly every nest, its longest stay 
being three seconds. It was opposed only by male and female 
Lcgatus. No ZarJiynchus in the tree." This is my last record of 
Cassidix for the season, though observations were continued until 
April 1. 

In these ob;r;ervations the long flights, the visits of inspection and 
the forced entrance into nests are of interest. If Cassidix is para- 
sitic only on species of the oropendola-cacique group it must cover 
comparatively great distances in its search for a host. In my ex- 
perience the nesting places of colonial birds of the same species 
are not close together. On Barro Colorado, for example, as we have 
seen, only three colonies of Zarhynchus are known. Cassidix, there- 
fore, must not only cover much territory but presumably she must 
be aware of the stage of the nesting season wdiich has beeJi reached 
by her prospective hosts. It would be useless to deposit eggs in 
the nests of birds not prepared to incubate them. Unless, therefore, 
Cassidix can control the development of her ovaries she must either 
waste eggs or know where to place them to advantage. 

Leyatus albicoUis. — An unexpected result of my studies of ZarAj/n- 
chus is the discovery that it is parasitized by Leyatus alhicollis. In 
each of the three nesting seasons devoted to the oropendolas a pair of 
these flycatchers made their home in the nest tree and constantly 
harried the oropendolas for the purpose of gaining possession of one 
or more of their nests. Leyatus was also found in the two other 
known nesting colonies of Zarhynchus on Barro Colorado, and its 
association with Zarhynchus^ at least on this island, appears therefore 
to be habitual. It will be interesting to learn whether it parasitizes 
other oropendolas. It arrives at about the time or even before the 
oropendola nests are completed and remains throughout their nesting 
season. In the morning it appears in the nest tree within a minute 
or two after the first Zarhynchus call is heard and it remains there 
until evening. It was never seen to feed from or near the nest tree 
but at intervals of an hour or more it darted to the adjoining forest 
evidently for food, but was rarely absent more than three minutes. 



376 ANNUAL KEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

Not less than 90 per cent of its time during the day was devoted 
to calling. No bird I have ever heard approaches Legatus in the con- 
tinuity with which its notes are uttered. Morning, noon, or after- 
noon it was the exception, when consciously listening, not to hear the 
voice of Legatus. Both sexes call, but the male seems to be the more 
vociferous and, when incubating, the female is apparently silent. 

Their usual note is " pee-ee " with a suggestion of the phoebe's 
{Sayornis phoebe) tons. To this is often added " teedle-dee-dee." 
There is also a " twee-twee-twee-twee," etc., uttered continuously, with 
closed bill, for as much as a minute. The female frequently uttered 
this note while the male called " pee-ee, teodle-dee-dee." During 
attacks on Zarhynchus both sexes utter an excited, reedy twittering 
and chattering. 

Legatus evidently considers itself a member of the Zarhynchus 
colony and, although its motives are unworthy, it often attacks Cas- 
sldix more zealousl}^ than does the owner of the nest which that bird 
seeks to enter. 

Since it is evident that Legatus plays an important part in the 
nest life of Zarhynchus I give the more significant of my observations 
concerning it as a contribution to our knowledge of their relation- 
ships, which, as will be seen, are as yet by no means clearly under- 
stood. In 192G Legatus was first noted in the nest tree on January 
29, 21 days after nest building began, but it was not until February 9 
that I realized the object of its presence. I quote from my records of 
that date : 

It is evident that Legatus is interested in the Zarhynchus nests. Two of these 
birds have attached a claim to two detached nests at the left side of the tree 
and fiercely attack their owners, often driving them from their own doorstep. 
The poor oropendola sits humbly in the protection of the leaves waiting for a 
chance to enter her own homo and in spite of the swinging onslaughts of Legatus 
finally succeeds by a dash. I have not seen Legatus enter either nest but tliey 
examine the opening and perch at the point to which the nest is woven with an 
unmistakable air of proprietorship. "What is their object? 

These birds were under observation until February 20 when I 
left the island for the season. They eventually focused their atten- 
tion on one of the two nests, called in my notes No. 1. On February 
17 for the first time one entered this nest remaining three seconds, 
to which Zarhynchus still asserted ownership by also entering for 
the night, both Legatus then going to the forest. On the 19th at 
12.05, after Zarhynchus left the nest, one Legatus entered and re- 
mained for five or six seconds. Both the flycatchers were about the 
nest the greater part of the day; at 3.25 Zarhynchus tried to enter 
it but was driven off and at 5.20 Legatus came from the forest and 
with almost no hesitation flew directly into the nest, remaining for 
10 or 12 seconds. At 4.40 the flycatcher was in the nest for 15 seconds 



NESTING HABITS OF OROPENDOLA — CHAPMAN 377 

and Zarhynchus had not appeared. On February 20 at 7.35 a. m. 
Legatus entered the nest and remained for 25 seconds. Three minutes 
hder Zarhynchus entered the second nest without protest, but at 
7.45 when a ZarJiynchus came to Xo. 1 it was driven away by Le- 
gatns. Thereafter, during the day, Legatus entered nest No. 1 fre- 
quently and my notes say, " It seems apparent that they now have 
possession of Xo. 1." Here, as above stated, my observations ended 
but I left a note asking Dr. J. Van Tyne, who reached the island 
February L'"^, to continue them. He reports that the activities of 
Legatus did not, ajiparently, lead to definite results. 

In 1927 Legatus was first noted January 31 (23 days after nest 
building began). For the first few days the bird perched in the 
top of the tree frequently uttering its " pee-ee " note. I was now 
absent for three days, returning February G when there were two 
birds j)resent. One of them dove at nests 1 and 3 of group 1, and 
attacked one of their owners. From that date until the end of my 
observations on April 1, there were few moments during the day 
when these birds were not present in the nest tree. Their notes 
were heard almost constantly and the greater part of their time was 
devoted to attacks on Zarhynchus and to examining its nests. These 
attentions were distributed throughout the colony, and were not con- 
centrated on any one nest or bird. At the end of the period of ob- 
servation the birds seemed to be no further advanced toward ac- 
quiring a home than tliey were at the opening of the season. Dr. 
J. Van Tyne, who reached the island February 24 and remained 
until August 21, was good enough to keep these birds under observa- 
tion. His notes in full are given on page 354. They show that 
Legatus was present until April 2G (when apparently because of 
heavy rains the oropendolas abandoned the colony) but that it was 
as "ineffectual as ever." 

Several entries in my journal for 1927 may be quoted : 

February 26. Legatus attacks any bird entering group 1, but seems still to 
prefer No. 1. Both go to the entrance, drop and partly spread their wings, 
lower their heads and turn half ry^ht then half left with a queer little bow ; a 
singular, self-conscious kind of performance. 

March 11. Lvgatun shows no decicasc in energy or interest. It is now chiefly 
In the west end of group 2, calling and lluttering excitedly at nest entrances. 

March 24. Legatus seems to be more aggressive and active. They attack 
almost any Zarhynchus and swing from group 1 to group 2 and back. No. 12 
receives most of their attention but no choice has been made. There are two 
deserted nests in group 1 but they probably coulaiu eggs. But doubtless those 
in group 2 do also. 

As a rule Zarhynchus avoids L^egatus, as already described, but 
when the small bird's attacks exasperate it beyond the limit of en- 
durance it assumes the aggressive. The record for March 6, 1927, 
reads: "A female Zarhynchus pursues Legatus around and around 



378 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

the tree and is herself pursued by the other Ler/atus." On March 
12 and 15 similar incidents were noticed, and from the record of 
March 22 I quote : 

While Lcgatus was perched at the entrance to a ZarhyncJius nest the owner 
popped out and pursued her persistently, following her at least 10 times 
around through the tree and on two wide circles over the forest. Meanwhile 
the other Lcgatus pui'sued the attacker. 

In 1928 a single Legatus, presumably a male, was heard calling 
from the nest tree at C.30 on the morning of January 16 (14 days 
after the nest building began). After calling for about two hours 
from the upper part of the tree (not near the nests) he disappeared. 
At 5 p. m. he called again for a few times and departed. Probably 
the same bird was present on the 17th and 19th. On the latter date 
my entry reads: 

Only one Lcgatus seen. He sits in the top of the oropeudola tree calling, 
perhaps for a mate ; but already shows a sense of proprietorship by chasing 
Cassidix. 

On January 20 a second bird, probably a female, appeared. Threa 
days later I wrote : 

Legatus is now in full swing in group 1. Both birds attack every Zarhynchus, 
indiscriminately, males as well as females. The males are not even permitted 
to court but are driven from their perches by the wasp-like attack of these two 
relentless little birds, who one after the other dart at them and swing upward 
to dart again. The females are similarly annoyed both when they enter and 
leave the nest and also in the air, as they approach it. Often they are prevented 
from entering and take refuge among nearby leaves to await an opportunity 
to slip in unnoticed. The life of the whole group is being disorganized by the 
persistent and constant annoyance of these two irritating flycatchers. They 
have apparently chosen No. 6 for their especial victim but they by no means 
restrict their attention to her. 

On January 28 one Legatus was seen sitting at the entrance to 
nest No. 5, which, although it had been attacked by an owl on the 
night of January 25, as before described, was still occupied by its 
owner. On February 1, No. 5 was entered by Cassidix. The bird 
remained for four seconds, Legatus alone protesting. 

Between February 1 and 7 the record for Legatus is summed up in 
the entry for the 4th which reads: ''''Legatus continues its endless 
peedle-dee-deeing but seems to get nowhere." Occasionally it chased 
a Zarhynchus. On the last-named date I record : 

Legatus now worries the owners of Nos. 1 and 2, group 1, The latter chased 
one of the flycatchers out of the tree this morning. If they want a nest why do 
they not take either No. 3 or No. 4 which are deserted but look in good con- 
dition? This afternoon the Legatus which I believe to be the female entered 
No. 1 and remained for 18 seconds. 

There were no further developments until February 11. My record 
for that day is as follows : 

It looks as though the Legatus puzzle had tinally solved itself. At 12.45 I 
chanced to see Legatus enter No. 5, group 1. On emerging, after four or five 



NESTING HABITS OF OROPENDOLA — CHAPMAN 379 

seconds, she left the tree nnd nt the end of about two minutes returned and 
entered No. 5 n^'aiii. Unvins my phiss now turned on the nest I saw that she 
carried somethin;: in her bill. Movinp with my 'J4-p<»wer glass to the end of 
the laboratory I saw, when some two minutes later she reentered the nest, that 
she carried what a|>peared to be a small bit of a brown leaf. She entered tl»e 
nest so (|Uiikly, however, that I eould not be sure of the exact uatiire of her 
burden, but two visits later she brou;;ht an entire leaf perhaps three-fourths of 
an inch Ion?. It seemed evident, therefore that .she was building a nest. I say 
"she" for the one that remained outside, perohinir within a few inches of the 
nest opening, called constantly and jn'oeted the builder with vociferous, excited 
twitterings on her return. DuriiiR the succeedinR 20 minutes 10 visits were 
made by the female, each time with buildinf? material. Only twice during the 
succecHling four hours did Zarhiinchnu appear. Once a female swept down as 
the female I.cgatus was about to enter, and at 3.5"!. while the female LrgatuJt 
was in the nest and the male at its door, a Zarhynchus came with the apparent 
intention of entering but she retreated quickly before the fury of the Lcgatus 
attack. Half a minute later the female tlycatcher continued her work. 

Thereafter Legaius was left in undisturbed possession of this nest. 
It may be noted that my records now showed this nest to have been 
visited by Cas^idLv, attacked by owls and cluiined by Legating. 

For the succeeding seven days Legatvs continued peacefully to 
occupy, or at least frequent, this nest No. 5 of group 1. but P^ebruary 
10, to my surprise, both birds were seen fiercely attacking nests Nos. 
1 and 2 in group 2, fully 40 feet above No. 5 of group 1. They 
perched at the entrance to the nest, fluttered excitedly and peered 
within ju.st as though they were prospecting for a home. At 6 p. m. one 
was .'^een sitting within No. 5, its head only showing at the entrance. 

The combined attacks of Legatus^ and of what I believe to be 
Pulsatrix^ finally resulted in the complete disorganization and aban- 
donment of the Zarhynchus colony, and on February 26 I write 
'' apparently not an oropendola left in the tree. Lcgatv^s having no 
fresh fields to conquer may now devote herself to her own affair.s.*' 

From February 10 to March 4 Lcgatus was heard calling with un- 
diminished energy, but I saw only what I believe to be the male bird 
and assumed that his mate was sitting and would at any day produce 
a brood in nest No. 5. On ]March 4 the female was seen preening 
near the male but I did not succeed in tracing her to a nest, and on 
March 5 it appeared tliat they were interested in nest No. 2 of group 
2, and apparently had deserted No. 5 of group 1, in which they had 
built a nest. No evidences of building in No. 2 were observed but 
the evidence indicated that on ]\rarcli 12 she was inruliating in that 
nest. My record follows: 

8 a. m. Female Lcgatus perches near the entrance to No. 2, group 2, the male 
nearby. She preens her plumage disclosing a wide parting from sternum to 
vent, which bespeaks the sitting bird, then enters the nest. 

March 15, I record : 

7..S0 a. m. A male Znrh]inchHK alislifs on nest next to that of Lrgntus. 
They both attack with frenzy and finally drive him off. Then the male Lcgatus 



380 AISTNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 

looks in the nest fluttering and callinq; excitedly and after he repeats this per- 
formance she enters. 5.15 p. m. Both Legatus sit near nest preening. She 
flies in and remains. He continues to call. Have not heard her call since she 
began to nest. 

From this date until March 24, the life of the two flycatchers 
centered about this nest which the female was seen to enter almost 
daily. 

On the night of the 23d the twig to which nest No. 1 of group 2 
was attached broke and the nest fell. It was found to have the 
round hole in the side at the inner nest level that I associate with 
nocturnal attack and, since there was not sufficient wind to account 
for the fall of the nest, I attribute the mishap to the weight and 
movements of the marauding visitor. There was nothing in the nest 
when, early on the morning of the 24th, I picked it up beneath the 
tree. 

This nest hung with, and almost touched. No. 2 occupied by 
Legatus. The latter nest was also seen to be penetrated by a hole 
similar to that in No. 1. My records for the day read in part; 

7.30-8 a. m. Lcgatuft. male, sits above nest calling as vigorously as in Jan- 
uary. The female appears, and preens showing the abdominal parting. The 
male flutters excitedly at the month of the nest but does not enter. He re- 
turns to a calling perch and the female enters the nest. All perfectly regular 
but where are the young? 

Later in the forenoon I wrote : 

Male and female Legatus perched near nest. Both call " tweet-tweet," etc. 
This is the first time I had seen her call since she began incubating, . . . Fe- 
male Legatus again near nest preening. She is off the nest more to-day than 
at any previous time during incubation. Twice the male has attacked her 
standing over her with fluttering wings while she with belly up hangs below 
him. I saw no blow struck but the attitudes were those of offense and defense. 
After a few seconds both flew off. 

At 11 a. m. the female entered the nest. i\Iarch 25 Legatus called 
as usual. At 4 p. m. a male Zarhynchus alighted on their nest. 
I^egatus attacked vigorously but for the first time under this threat 
no female appeared. 

Legatus continued to call loudly and persistently on the 25th and 
26th but no female was seen. On the 28th, however, one appeared. 
My record reads: 

Legatus has not called in vain. A female of his species was present this 
morning and the evidence indicates that she was not the bird that occupied and 
v%-as apparently nesting in No. 2. He chases her and is, I think, trying to show 
her one of the group of four nests in group 2. She seems to be in fresher, less 
worn plumage than the supposedly missing female, and when preening, which 
she does only occasionally, the feathers do not part widely in the center of 
the abdomen. She perched for a moment on No. 2 but she did not enter. 

March 29, 30, 31, Legatus called with all the vigor of the early sea- 
son but no female appeared. At this point my record for the season 
ends. 



NESTING HABITS OP OBOPENDOLA — CHAPMAN 381 

I can present only ti theoretical interpretation of the actions of 
this pair of birds. To me they indicate that the contents of their 
nest (Xo. 2, Group 2) havini; been destroyed by nii^'ht attack, the 
female deserted. The male then attracted the attention of another 
female but did not succeed in winning her as a mate. 

ASSOCIATED SPECIES 

The sand-box tree in which the oropendolas nest forms an attrac- 
tive and advantageous perch, particularly for birds that cross the 
clearing. During the period covered by these observations I have 
seen slightly over 50 species of birds in it. Four of these species, in 
addition to Zarhyncliu^ and Leyatus, nest in the tree; they are the 
violet-throated humming bird {Anthracothorax violaceicollis) ^ the 
Colombian flycatcher {Myiuzetetes tcxensis columhlanus), Natterer's 
cotinga {Cotlnya natteren) ^ and the blue tanager {Thraupis cana). 
Of all the birds seen in the tree, only six appear to have direct asso- 
ciation with Zarhynchus. They are a cowbird {Cassidix oryzivo/a), 
a fl3'catcher {Leyatus alhicoUis), a hawk {Splzafttur melanoleucus) ^ 
an owl [Puhati'ix perspiclllafa), a cacique {Caclcus vitellinus) and 
a humming bird {Anthracothorax nlgncoUls). 

The first two are parasitic, the second two, predaceous. Their 
observed relations to Zarhynchus have already been described under 
the section devoted to the enemies of Zarhyyichus. The relations of 
the remaining two I will speak of here. 

Cacicus viteUinua. — From the beginning to the end of the nesting 
season, as I have observed it, usually one caci(|ue is present in the 
nest tree acting as though it were a member of the colony. Rarely 
two males were seen, and on February IG two males and two females 
were in the tree at the same time. One male, however, is the normal 
Cacicus representative. This bird often arrives as soon as the first 
Zarhynchus^ and it, or another, may be in the tree the greater part 
of the day. It makes no attempt to associate closely with Zarhynchus 
and does not perch very near the nests, its chief activity being the 
delivery of its calls. While bearing a general resemblance to those 
of Zarhynchus the notes of Cacicus are more varied, more musical 
and louder, and they are uttered more continuously and more insist- 
ently, at times for an hour or more without ceasing. In view of the 
fact that no other individual of its own species is in the tree or ap- 
parently near, and that the bird addresses only a general and un- 
responsive audience, its energy and ])ersistencc are inexplicable. 
At its maxhnum the delivery of its notes is accompanied by an in- 
teresting display in which the wing tips are crossed beneath the tail 
and behind the feet, the yellow rump feathers fluffed and expanded, 
while the wings and tail are violently treml)led. This continues for 
several minutes as the bird calls loudly. Occasionally a male 



382 ANNUAL EEPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

Zarhynchus drives the too willing performer from his perch but be- 
yond this no attention is paid to him. According to Jewell, as re- 
ported by Stone/* Cacicus nests in the Canal Zone in March. One 
might imagine, therefore, that the male or males that devote them- 
selves so earnestly to the Zarhynchus colony might find more 
appreciative listeners in the females of their own species. 

AntJiracothorax nkjricoTlis. — Nesting in the sand-box tree evi- 
dently gives the black-throated hununer a sense of proprietorship 
Avhich leads it to attack nearly every trespassing species including 
Zarhynchus and its enemy Gassidix. The bird, therefore, plays some 
part in the nest life of the oropendola while the regularity of its 
return to the nest tree affords additional evidenc eof marked perio- 
dicity and localization in tropical birds. 

On January 16, 1926, a black-throated humming bird was dis- 
covered on the eastern side of the sand-box tree building its nest near 
the tip of an absolutely bare limb at least 25 feet from the nearest leaf. 
There was not a more expose site in the tree. From this point it 
attacked birds trespassing within its territory with a dash and 
courage which promptly put them to flight. Oropendolas were 
frequently followed to their nesting quarters and sometimes driven 
from the tree. So effective and persistent were the bird's assaults 
it seemed not improbable that if they had been made before the 
oropendolas had begun to build they might have prevented them 
from settling in the tree. 

On only one occasion did the bird retreat before a trespassing 
species, this was a white snake-hawk {Leucopfernis ghieshrechti) 
which in one instance perched within a few feet of the hummer which 
promptly took flight. On the other hand a bucco {Bucco subtectus) 
was permitted to sit for some time near the hununer's nest without 
molestation. The nest was apparently completed about January 20, 
and the bird began to sit some time between January 21 and 25. It 
was believed to contain young on February 9, and on the 11th the 
parent was definitely seen to feed the young. On February 19 the 
lulls of both young could be seen above the rim of the nest. On this 
date observation ceased. 

In 1927 a humming bird of the same species built a nest on the 
nearest available site to the one occupied in 1927, the limb on which 
that nest was placed having meanwhile fallen. When discovered 
on January 19 the bird appeared to be incubating. On the morning 
of January 30 this nest and bird were missing. 

On January 11, 1928, a female violet-throated humming bird was 
discovered building a nest at or very near the site occupied by this 
species in 1927. She apparently began to sit about January 15. 

" 1918, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci., Pbila., p. 280. 



NESTING HABITS OF OROPENDOLA — CHAPMAN 383 

The date of hatch injjj was not ascertained but on February 3. during 
the process of feedinjr, the bills of the young could be seen above 
the rim of the nest. One of these young left the nest on February 
20, the other on February 22. On March 12 a female, presumably 
the mother of the first brood, was seen on the nest, which had been 
renovated, apparently laying. On March 14 she began to sit and 
she was still incubating when last I saw her on March 24. 

Cotinfia nattereri}'' — On March 24, 1927, 1 discovered a nest of 
Natterer's cotinga in the sand-box tree. So far as I am aware it 
is not only the first recorded nest of the species but of any member 
of the group of blue cotingas. It was about 90 feet above the ground, 
halfwav between the trunk and the terminal twigs in the anfjle 
formed by an orchid growing from the side of a nearly horizontal 
limb about 5 inches in diameter. It was occupied by a female brood- 
ing two young that were covered, apparently, with sno^^'y white 
down. 

On March 31 the young were missing and on April 2 the nest was 
partly pulled to pieces by the female. During this period no male 
cotinga was seen. 

On February 8, 1928. a female cotinga Avas seen building a nest 
in exactly the same place occupied by this species the preceding 
year. February 16 the female was on the nest, evidently laying, 
and from this date she was seen sitting on the nest until March 12. 
On March 13 she was missing and no cotinga was seen until March 
20 when a female was observed perched in the top of the sand-box 
tree for about 30 minutes. She was not seen to visit the deserted 
nest. Four days later a female was seen in the sand-box tree with 
a rootlet in her bill and on March 28 a female began to build a nest 
on the north side of the tree, slightly above and about 50 feet 
from the abandoned nest. 

It seems not improbable that the owner of the first nest, having 
been robbed of her eggs, had started a new nest. However that 
may be, I give these facts for the additional proof they afford that 
tropical birds ma}' return to the same nest site and nest at approxi- 
mately the same date in successive years. If the nest of 1928 had 
not been disturbed, the dates given indicate that the young would 
have hatched shortly, when on March 24, the nest would have 
contained young of approximately tlio same age as those discovered 
in the same nest site the preceding year. 

On two occasions a female Cotiruja nattererl was observed on the 
sand-box tree in 1920, but, as I have before remarketl, the tree was 
not then under close observation and no nest was discovered though 
it is by no means unlikely that one existed.

periodicity and sexual relation In Z<^rhynchuK. 



384 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 

On only three occasions during the three seasons I have passed on 
Barro Colorado have I seen a male Cotinga nattereri near the labora- 
tory. None of these was in the sand-box tree. Two perched for a 
few moments at the top of a dead tree about 100 feet from the sand- 
box tree. They were alone. The third was at the border of the 
forest, 120 yards from the sand-box tree. A few minutes after he 
flew back into the forest a female cotinga left the forest from nearly 
the same place and flew to the nest in the sand-box tree. This was 
on February 14, 1928, when my observations indicate that the female 
was lajdng. It is not improbable, therefore, that the sexes were 
associated on this occasion. 

Thraupis cana. — A pair of blue tanagers nested in the oropendola 
tree in the season of 1927 and 1928. They selected for their site a 
large mass of parasitic plants (the lower side of which was occupied 
by a colony of stingless bees) where it was not possible to watch 
them closely and I have no notes on the progress of their nesting. 

An iguana {Iguana iguana)^ between four and five feet in length, 
was usually present in the sand-box tree and on occasions two smaller 
ones were observed. They would lie motionless for hours stretched 
out on the larger, upper limbs, apparently sunning themselves. 
Rarely they ate the leaves of the tree. None of the birds that fre- 
quented the tree were seen to notice them, nor were the iguanas con- 
cerned with the birds. 

SUMMARY OF OBSERVATIONS ON A NESTING COLONY OF ORO- 
PENDOLAS {ZARHYNCHV8 WAGLERI) ON BARRO COLORADO 
ISLAND, CANAL ZONE 

The tree occupied by the oropendolas, when, in 1924, the laboratory 
was established, having fallen in June of that year, the present site 
was selected the following year. The new tree, which is believed 
to have been chosen chiefly because of its proximity to the former 
home, does not apparently offer the advantages of the fallen one and 
the colony appears to be decreasing in numbers. 

The birds exhibit much regularity in the date at which they begin 
to nest. In 1926 and 1927 nest building began on January 8, in 
1928, on January 2. A humming bird {Anthracothorax nigri- 
collis) and a cotinga {Cotinga nattereri) that nested in the oropen- 
dola tree showed a similar regularity in site and date. While the 
nesting season coincides roughly with the dry season, the exact time 
of its inauguration does not appear to be closely dependent on the 
rainfall. Temperature apparently presents too little variation to be 
a controlling factor. The return of these birds to the same place year 
after year illustrates the homing instinct, while the seasonal regu- 
larity of their visit is in evident response to those annual prompt- 



NESTING HABITS OF OROPENDOLA- — CHAPMAN 385 

ings of tlie reproductive system which are believed to have been the 
fundamental motivatin<j: factors in the orifjin of bird mi^^^ration. 

Data on a second or supplementary nesting season are not con- 
clusive. 

The females outnumber the males about six to one. If this dis- 
parity of the sexes is an actual characteristic of the species it may 
be the cause of the colonial association that permits one male to mate 
with several females. The males show no marked sexual jealousy. 
Courtship begins with nest building. A male may woo several 
females but he apparently has but one mate at a time; the length 
of this association covering only the period when the ova are ready 
for fertilization. A similar type of sexual relation appears to exist 
in the humming bird and cotinga that nest in the oropcndola tree. 

The males take no part in the selection of the site, gathering of 
building material, construction of the nest, incubation of the eggs 
or care of the young. They are, however, in constant attendance on 
the females either as wooers or accepted mates until the eggs aro 
laid. As watchmen of the colony they play an important part in 
the protection of the females, particularly in the early stages of nest 
construction. 

Only two other colonies of Zarhynchus being known on the island 
there is no question of colonial territorial rights; but there is often 
pronounced competition among the females for possession of a nest 
site. 

A new nest is built each year, about one month being required for 
the completion of the bag and its contained nest. The females 
then begin to sleep in the nest, leaving the males, who never enter 
the nest, to return unaccompanied to their roost in the forest. 

Two eggs are laid. The period of incubation is approximately 
17 days. The young leave the nest about one month after hatching. 

The terminal twigs of the nest tree are brittle and in a strong wind 
sometimes break. Nests that fell from this cause contained both eggs 
and young but were not found to be infested by parasites. The only 
ascertained enemies of the oropendolas were other birds. They are 
parasitized by a cowbird {Cassidix), and a flycatcher (Legatiis), no 
larger than a phoebe {Sayornis /^Aoe&e), constantly harries them with 
the evident purpose of securing possession of one of their nests for 
its own uses. The building female is at times susceptible to attack 
by hawks, from which it appears to be the duty of the male to guard 
her. In response to his alarm call the entire colony dives hastily into 
the lower forest growth. An owl {Fulsatrix) makes an opening in 
the lower part of the nest bag and the oropendolas appear to be 
at the mercy of this foe. The inaccessibility of the nest site, and 
impregnability of tiie pendant, strongly woven nest bag are, there- 
fore, more apparent than real. Furthermore, the conspicuousness 



386 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

of their homes offsets the advantages of colonial nesting with its 
implied absence of marked sexual and territorial jealousy and in- 
creased protection through the community interests that make the 
enemy of one the enemy of all. 

Zarhynchus can not lay the slightest claim to the possession of a 
protectively hued plumage. In color, size, and habit, during the 
most critical period of its annual cycle, it is highly self-advertising. 
Its safety depends on that constant vigilance which keeps it ever 
on the alert and on the instant, unquestioned obedience to the alarm 
note that prompts it to dive headlong into the dense vegetation 
from which it is never far distant. 

POSTSCRIPT 

The day that this paper was completed I received word from Mr, James 
Zetek, resident custodian of Barro Colorado, that the sand-box tree in which 
the oropendolas nested was blown down by a severe windstorm on August 28, 
1928. Evidently, lilve its predecessor, this tree, as a member of a forest com- 
munity, had not developed sufficient hold upon the ground to stand alone. 

I had hoped that this contribution to our knowledge of the nesting habits 
of Zarhynclius would form the opening chapters of a history that would in- 
crease in interest as added data enabled us to view the present in the light of 
the past. But so far as the sand-box colony is concerned I can now write only 
finis, 

SECOND POSTSCRIPT 

On March 8, 1930, what for various reasons we believe to be the laboratory 
colony of oropendolas was found in a large almendro (Coumaronna panamensis) 
situated about a mile from the laboratory near No. 14 on the Shannon Trail. 

On January 8, 1931, 17 oropendolas, including 4 males, were observed in this 
tree. They had evidently begun to build on January 6 or 7. These dates are 
so near those records for the laboratory colony (Jan. 8; Jan. 8; Jan. 2; antea, 
p. 352) that they further emphasize the seasonal regularity of the breeding of 
these birds on Barro Colorado and, at the same time, confirm our belief that 
the laboratory colony moved to the almendro. 



THE iUSE OF AP1»LIED ENTOMOLOGY IN THE UNITED 

STATES ' 



Hv L. O. Howard 



At the tenth anmuil lueetinj^' of the Agricultural History Society, 
held September 13, 1927, my hi«j;hly esteemed friend, Dr. B. T. Gallo- 
way, presented a review of the development of plant pathi)lo<j:y in 
the United States; and his introductory paragraphs apply so well to 
insect damage that they might well be used for the present paper, 
simply substituting the words "' agricultural entomology " for '" plant 
pathology." 

It is true that economic entomology is an older applied science, and 
hence it is true that for many years the entomologists looked upon 
the plant pathologists in the somewhat patronizing way that an elder 
brother looks upon a much younger one. In fact, as the years went 
by a certain amount of good-natured chaff was heard between the 
men of these different kinds of work. The entomologist was apt to 
say, " There is nothing of a practical character in plant pathology 
except the recommended use of the Bordeaux mixture under all con- 
ditions." I recall that I made that remark once to Doctor Galloway 
and that he countered immediately by saying " There is, after all, 
nothing to economic entomology but the application of arsenicals for 
chewing insects and of dilute kerosene emulsion for sucking insects." 

All that, however, is quite aside from my present purpose. 

I have just returned from a long trip across; the country. I have 
seen at Riverside and Berkeley, at Seattle, and at Minneapolis, at 
Madison and at Urbana, large classes of earnest young men and 
women studying applied entomology; and at five of these places I 
have seen large corps of teachers, admirably equipped, all good re- 
search men, engaged in this teaching work. I have seen that the 
popular estimate of the entomologist has become very high. I have 
asked some of these teachers whether they felt, on account of their 
occupation, the faintest indications of an inferiority complex. All 
replied at once that they were proud of their work, that they were 
convinced of its great importance, and that they considered them- 
selves among the most useful members of their respective faculties.

Moreover, I have seen, contrary to the old ideas, that the fear of 
insects is increasing; that people realize that they are causing in- 
creasing damage to humanity in an increasing number of ways. 

Last Friday the United States House of Representatives, after a 
10-minute discussion, passed a joint resolution appropriating 
$4,250,000 to be expended in an effort to exterminate the Mediterra- 
nean fruit fly in Florida. This morning the Senate, without discussion, 
passed the same resolution. Two years ago the Congress appropri- 
ated the very great sum of $10,000,000 to be spent in an effort to 
retard the westward march of the European corn borer. Fifty -three 
years ago, after the Rocky Mountain locust, or western grasshopper, 
had devastated large portions of four of our Western States, not 
only causing enormous financial loss, but bringing starvation and 
disease to verj' many people, a bill was introduced before Congress 
to appropriate $25,000 for a commission of entomologists to investi- 
gate locusts and to try to find mean? to prevent future damage of 
the sort. The Congress, after long consideration, reduced the amount 
from $25,000 to $18,000, and a bill for the latter amount was passed. 

Now what has caused the change between the conditions as I have 
described them as of the present and the condition that existed 
only a little more than 50 years ago? That is the story that I am 
trying to tell elsewhere in some detail, and I will brief its salient 
points in this paper. 

Let us assume that the territory now covered by the United States 
of America w^as in a condition of at least temporary stable equi- 
librium in regard to its animal and plant life at the period when 
settlement by the white race began. For a great many years the 
increase in the white population was slow. Agriculture was of 
small extent and spread out slowly into the forests and plains. 
There was very slow communication with other countries and none 
at all with any but those of Europe. There was practically no 
chance for the accidental importation of insect pests. The crops 
that were cultivated were in large part of the sorts that were new to 
the country. Native insects at first did not damage them seriously, 
and down to the peried of the War of the Revolution there were 
few complaints of insect damage. 

After the revolution, however, from time to time the scarce news- 
papers that paid attention to agriculture would record the unusual 
abundance of some pest; but on the whole no attention was paid 
to the subject that would warrant mention in a brief paper like this. 
The only great crop pests that had come to us from Europe prior 
to the revolution were the codling moth and the Hessian fly. 

Prior to 1800, the only writer on the subject we need mention here 
was William Dandridge Peck (1763-1822), who was professor of 
natural history in Harvard College and who wrote in 1795 about 



APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY — HOWARD 389 

llie cankerwoiin. lie followed, in the early years of the nineteenth 
century, with several papers on various injurious insects. 

In 1841, Dr. ThaiUleus William Harris, librarian of Harvard 
College, published a report on '' Insects injurious to vegetation in 
Massachusetts." It was a scholarly work, and it treated of many 
plant-feedin<:^ forms. There was no mention of any critical danger, 
and the remedies suggested were little more than of the old Scotch 
gardener type. 

A few years later (1853) Townend Glover received an appoint- 
ment in the Bureau of Agriculture of the United States Patent 
Oflice. One of his numerous duties was " to collect information on 
insects." 

The next year. Dr. Asa Fitch of New York was authorized by 
the New York State Legislature to examine insects, "especially 
those injurious to vegetation,'' and ihus became practically the 
lirst State entomologist. He published a series of reports from that 
time until 1872. They were full and careful reports, and in them 
he described the life histories of many important species but brought 
out nothing striking in regard to methods of control. 

Benjamin Dann Walsh, a trenchant writer on entomological 
subjects, was acting State entomologist of Illinois in the year 18G7. 
He was a man of high culture, broad- view.s, and a prophetic mind. 
He was especially and harshly critical of many of the remedial 
measures then in vogue, and was particularly keen in his criticisms 
of the fake remedies that were then being foisted on the public and 
as a matter of fact are still being advertised from time to time. 
Referring to such so-called remedies, one of his phrases sticks in 
my mind : " Long live King Humbug ! He still feeds fools on flap- 
doodle ! " He published but one report, although he had previously 
been an associate editor of a journal, published in Philadelphia, 
called " Tiie Practical Entomologist," and later was associate editor, 
with C. V. Riley, of The American Entomologist, a journal devoted 
largely to practical matters in entomology. 

In 1878 Glover was retired from the position of entomologist 
to the Ignited States Department of Agriculture, and Charles Val- 
entine Riley was made his successor. Riley served until 1804, with 
the exception of the years 1879 and 1880, during which period John 
Henry Comstock (before and afterwards professor of entomologv 
at Cornell University) held the position. 

The work done by Riley and Comstock in the De])artment of Agri- 
culture was of the highest type. Riley had previously served as 
State entomologist of Missouri from 18G9 nntil 187G and had pub- 
lished nine reports, admirably illu.strated and very sound, whicli 
did much to show the importance of careful woik. These Missouri 
reports are full of notable things and from the jiractical point of 
2bUD5— yi 2(i

390 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

view one of the most striking is the effective work that he did in 
the investigation of the grapevine Phylloxera and in the subsequent 
selection of resistant vine stocks from the United States for shipment 
to Europe for grafting purposes. He thus played an important 
part in the saving of the wine industry. 

During the two years that Comstock served at Washington he 
accomplished a number of important things. One of them was the 
preparation of a large volume on cotton insects, but still more im- 
portant was his study of the scale insects. He worked out the clas- 
sification and life histories of very many of the injurious scale in- 
sects of the United States, an accomplishment that proved to be 
of the greatest value, since in the ensuing years many scale insects 
proved to be extremely injurious. 

During Riley's final term of office (1881-1894) progress was great. 
Many important investigations were begun. The entomological 
service was made a division, and the funds for research were slowly 
increased by Congress. Aside from the rather elaborate annual 
reports, many bulletins and circulars as well as a few special reports 
were published. Seven volumes of an important illustrated periodi- 
cal bulletin called " Insect Life " were also published and very widely 
circulated. The achievement of Riley's administration, however, 
that attracted the widest popular and scientific interest was the bril- 
liantly successful introduction of the Coccinellid, Vedalia {Noviv/s) 
cardinalis from Australia to destroy the cottony cushion scale in 
California. This scale was causing the citrus growers of that State 
the greatest alarm. The very existence of citrus culture in Califor- 
nia was threatened. Some orchards actually went down under the 
ax. But in a very few months after the introduction of the little 
beetle all fears were gone. So rapid was the multiplication of the in- 
troduced insect and so great was its voracity, that the scale insect 
soon ceased to be feared. This was the first large demonstration of 
the possible value of the introduction from one country to another of 
the natural enemies of an introduced insect pest. 

In 1876, as indicated in a previous paragraph, the Federal Con- 
gress appropriated $18,000 to be spent by a commission of three 
men to investigate the Rocky Mountain locust. This action was the 
first national legislation of any importance of this kind. It was 
largely brought about by hard and intelligent work on the part of 
Professor Riley. It is interesting to note that while the bill making 
this appropriation was under discussion in the House, The Nation, 
considered at the time to be possibly the leading journal representing 
the best public opinion, published in its issue for March 16 the fol- 
lowing satirical note: 

The Republicans in the Senate, not to be beaten at investigations, have 
passed a bill to investigate insects injurious to vegetation — the locust, the 



APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY — HOWARD 391 

oliinch buK, the army worm, the Hessian fly, and the potato buf,'. The bill pro- 
vides for an investigator in chief at a salary of $4,000 a year, the Herculean 
labors of the head of the Agrieultural Bureau preventing that oflicial from 
giving the necessary time to it. The act, should it pass the House — which 
sei'ms doubtful — will be a new application of the ^Tcat ptinrlplo of division of 
labor, for in future the Ai^ricultural Commissioner will scatter the seed broad- 
oast over the land, while the national entomologist will follow closely on bis 
trail and exterminate the various bugs that may attack the ripening grain. 
We only want now another commissioner to harvest the crops, and another to 
see that they get to deep water, and the husbandman will be entirely relieved 
from grinding toil. 

It was ideas of that sort and public opinion of that kind that 
Kilcy and his colleaojiies had to combat in those days; and the prog- 
ress made in the face of ignorance and apathy is extraordinary. 

When Ililey left Missouri his phice as entomologist of that State 
was not filled. Illinois appointed Dr. William LeBaron as suc- 
cessor to Walsh, and he in turn was succeeded by the Rev. Cyrus 
Thomas, who was followed by Dr. S. A. Forbes. 

With the passage of the Hatch Act in 1888 and the starting of 
State agricultural experiment stations, a very considerable impulse 
was given to work in entomology; and the creation of positions, 
enabled by this act, turned the attention of a number of good young 
men in this direction. It seemed for the first time that there might 
be a career in economic entomology. As a result also, the teaching 
of economic entomology received a great impetus. New departments 
of this kind were established in the agricultural colleges and State 
imiversities. The demand for teachers at first was so great as to 
exceed the supply of trained men, and the early publications of the 
agricultural colleges and experiment stations were for the most part 
compilations from the writings of Fitch, Riley, Walsh, LeBaron, 
Thomas, Packard, and A. J. Cook. A. S. Packard, jr., by the way, 
had served for two years as State entomologist of ^Massachusetts, and 
Prof. A. J. Cook had been lecturing on insects for a number of years 
at the Michigan State Agricultural College. 

Soon after the starting of the experiment stations under the 
Hatch Act, the Association of Economic Entomologists was formed, 
and this association has come to be a very powerful factor in the 
development of applied entomology and in the correlation of the 
work of the many people engaged. 

The closing decade of the last century, however, witnessed four 
striking events that focused the attention of \evy many people and 
of very many countries on the subject of insect damage. The gipsy 
moth and the brown-tail moth were found in Massachu.setts; the 
cotton boll weevil cro.ssed tiie Rio Grande from Mexico; the San 
Jose scale was found in the East, and insects were discovered to 
carry certain diseases of man and of domestic animals. 



392 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

The great struggle against the gipsy moth, that has continued 
down to the present day, has had far-reaching results in several 
directions. It has hastened the discovery of effective insecticides; 
it has very largely improved high-power spraying machinery; it 
has resulted in a very large-scale and long-continued experiment 
looking toward natural control by the importation into the United 
States from Europe and Japan of the parasites and other natural 
enemies of the destructive species. 

The advent of the cotton boll weevil has demonstrated in a start- 
ling way the possibilities of insect damage. Entering the United 
States in the vicinity of Brownsville, Tex., it spread year after 
year until in about 25 years it covered the whole Cotton Belt. It 
brought about immense money loss; it caused the financial failure 
of many planters and of many banks; it complicated the labor 
situation and caused suicides among planters, bankers, and specu- 
lators. It called striking attention, however, to the weakness of 
the 1-crop system, and will prove in the long run to have been bene- 
ficial to the Southern States. 

The advent of the San Jose scale in the East caused great alarm 
for a number of years. It was the cause of quarantines against 
American fruits by most of the countries of the world. 

The discovery that insects may carry certain diseases to man and 
to domestic animals has proved of enormous benefit and has created 
a new branch of preventive medicine. Work following this dis- 
covery has eliminated yellow fever from the United States and 
from most other parts of the world and has greatly reduced mortal- 
ity and suffering from malaria and from many tropical diseases. 
In fact, investigations of this kind have opened up the possible 
habitation of tropical countries by the white race and the bringing 
of such countries into the greatly needed food-producing assets of 
the world. 

As time has gone on, since the beginning of the present century, 
we have seen, partly as the result of these striking events of the 
preceding 10 years, a rapidly-growing activity in the fight against 
insects. A very notable event was the passage of the law creating 
the Federal Horticultural Board administered by the Secretary 
of Agriculture. By the means of this act the country has been 
able measurably to protect itself against the importation of new 
pests from abroad, and the change of this board into the present 
Plant Quarantine and Control Administration has placed the work 
of this branch of the public service upon a strong base and will 
result in a more efficient protection of the country. 

In spite of the rapidly-growing actiAaty in the fight against 
insects, however, there has come strongly to our attention the fact 
that under present conditions, notwithstanding the increased num- 



APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY — HOWARD 393 

ber of workers, damage by insects is increasing rather than diminish- 
ing; and it has al.'^o become apparent that this increase is due almost 
entirely to our own methods in agriculture. 

The population of the country is growing rapidly. "Without 
counting immigration, we are now increasing at the rate of 1,000,000 
per year, and that rate itself is increasing. Every year we must 
feed very many more people than the year before. We must be 
growing more food constantly. Naturally, all these years we have 
adopted the quickest, the most economical and the most convenient 
ways of growing these foods. There have been enormous plantings 
of single and of allied crops. Often there has been very little 
rotation. In our haste to feed our increasing millions, we have 
overlooked the fact that we are feeding increasing billions of insects. 
By our very methods we are giving certain species of insects the 
most unprecedented chance to multiply. This will force us in many 
cases to change our methods — to vary our growing and our crop- 
ping systems. We must realize this at once. 

It is true that more than half our principal crop pests have been 
introduced accidentally in the course of commerce. With the 
passage of the plant quarantine act in 1912, we placed a barrier 
against this danger; but that it still exists is evident from the 
Florida experience of the last few weeks. And this Mediterranean 
fruit fl}', the pink bollworm, the Japanese beetle, and the Asiatic 
bettle, while still more or less local, will probably spread and will 
utilize to the full the fairly riotous living spread out on all sides. 
So that, after all, we not only welcome the hundreds of young 
men who are joining the ranks of the economic entomologists, but 
we beg for the assistance and cooperation of the farm organiza- 
tions and the farm leaders and especially the agronomists and the 
agricultural engineers, and also of the chemists, the physicists, 
and the plant physiologists. The trained entomologist can follow 
the life history of a given species. He can study it in all its 
aspects. He can work out its general ecology. He can find its 
weak point if it has any. He can find the reasons why it is in- 
creasing and spreading. Often he can point out how the greatest 
damage can be avoided by different farming methods. It is then 
the agronomist who must advise. The farm planners, the farm 
organizations, the farm leaders must then take hold. 

This is shown very well, I think, in the case of the European 
corn borer. The great danger from this pest would be nonexistent 
if it were not for the corn-growing system in a large part of the 
corn belt. The entomologists have shown tliat for seven months 
in the year the borer is helpless at the base of the cornstalks. Is it 
not obviously the duty of some other than the entomologist to 
find out the most economical and easiest way of getting rid of the 
cornstalks at some time during that long rest of seven months? 



MAN AND INSECTS 



By L. O. Howard 



An article for the Journal of the MarvhinJ Academy of Sciences 
should necessarily be thorouj,'hly sound scientilically. It should 
not be written in a sensational way. It should deal with facts and 
should reason lo<;iciilIy from these facts. 

I am inclined to think that the best way of statinj^ tlie case I 
wish to present will be in a series of limited and definitely stated 
parajijraphs. 

1. The insect type is very many millions of years older than 
the vertebrate type, of which the human species is the latest de- 
velopment. 

2. The insect type has, therefore, been tried out very thoroughly 
under world conditions, while the human species is comparatively 
in its merest infancy. 

3. Many forms of life have been tried, have been found wanting, 
and have disappeared in the course of the ages, but the insect type 
has persisted in spite of all cataclysms. 

4. The human type may be one of nature's experiments that 
will fail. It has not been in existence long enough to have been 
thoroughly tried out. 

5. The human species, in spite of its physical disadvantages, 
has jumped to the fore with unexampled speed owing principally 
to the evolution of the quality known as intelligence. Through this 
intelligence it has either destroj'ed or controlled or converted to 
its own use nearly all other forms of life. 

6. In its very rapid increase and spread, however, the human 
species has so disturbed the balance of nature as to favor the in- 
crease and spread of disease-bearing miscroorganisms and as to 
encourage enormously the multiplication and spread of injurious 
insects. In its efforts to feed its increasing millions, it has fed 
increasing billions of insects. 

7. Prophets of evil tell us that human overpopulation of the world 
is approaching, and approaching rapidly; that mass starvation is 
sure to come; that birth control is necessary if greater production 
of plant food can not be stimulated or if new foods can not be 
invented.

8. There is a third way of postponing the coming of the starvation 
era, and that is b}' the stopping of all waste. 

9. Probably the greatest of these wastes is the tremendous but 
unnecessary tribute that we pay to insects. In the United States 
alone, the labor of 1,000,000 men each year is lost through insect 
damage to crops and to our other vital interests. And this damage 
is increasing. The problem is very much greater than it was even 
20 j^ears ago. In order to get the quickest and most abundant food 
supplies, we are growing our crops in many instances in exactly the 
way to favor best the increase of crop pests. The cotton boll weevil, 
for example, might never have been heard of as a serious crop pest 
if it had not been brought by accident across the Rio Grande and 
found itself in a whole great State largely devoted to the growing of 
its favorite food and growing it in just the way to favor the beetle's 
multiplication to the extreme. The European corn borer, to take 
another example, would do little harm if we did not farm our corn- 
lands just as we do. 

10. It is necessary that we should understand present conditions — 
that we should understand that insects are our dangerous rivals for 
the food supplies of the world, and that they are our important rivals 
and enemies in many other ways. Then it will come about that 
many men will turn their attention to insect problems. Many men 
of sound training will study> every aspect of insect life. Competent 
chemists, physicists, botanists, agricultural engineers, and agrono- 
mists will take the findings of the increasing number of entomologists, 
and upon them will base measures for the relief of humanity. The 
time can not come too soon. Teachers of biology should at once 
begin to learn and to teach entomology. 

Having thus stated briefly and rather definitely what appears to 
me to be the situation and the general course that should be pursued, 
I think that it may be of interest to elaborate some of the points. 

In the paragraph numbered 5, we have referred to the physical 
disadvantages of the human species as compared with insects. From 
the engineering point of view the limb of a vertebrate, with the 
skeleton inside, other things being equal, is three times weaker than 
the insect limb having its skeleton on the outside. This outer 
skeleton of the insect is composed of chitin, an albuminoid that is 
attacked neither by alkaline solutions nor by dilute acid. It does 
not grow brittle with age like the bones of vertebrates. The muscles 
that are exposed in human beings to the slightest injury and are 
attached to the inner bones, are, in insects, covered and protected by 
the chitin, and they function better from their numerous attach- 
ments to ridges on the inner side of the covering. The insect skeleton 
is composed of waste material, while the bony skeleton of man is 
composed largely of proteins and inorganic materials, chiefly lime 



MAN AND INSECTS HOWARD 397 

and phosphorus. The starches and other substances that make the 
skeleton of insects, abound in nature ; while the diet of man must be 
selected carefully to include the substances needed for the pjrowth of 
bone. The blood of insects ponetratos to every part of the body, 
just as it does with us, but the air that purifies the blood also 
penetrates to every part of the body instead of beinfj confined to the 
Um»^s. When insects are born, there is no long period of helpless 
infancy; they take care of themselves from the start. There is no 
feeble old a.^e with insects; when their work is done they die before 
their faculties or their structure have bep;un to degenerate. Tiiere 
are no bones to grow brittle with age; chitin seems to grow stronger 
with age. 

Together with the advantages already pointed out comes the 
tremendous advantage of rapidity of multiplication and rapidity 
of growth and the consequent rapidity of the accommodation of a 
species to a changed environment. Insects, for example, have all 
the way from 1 to 20 generations a year, nature trying slowly to 
make each generation more fit than its predecessor. Place the 
number at five per annum, as is the case with the cotton boll weevil. 
Then, in the 35 years this insect has lived in the territory of the 
United States, it has had 175 generations. An equal number of 
generations for the human species would fill more than JJ,000 years. 
The advantage in the slow process of evolution and accommodation 
to changed conditions is evidently enormous. 

As to rapidity of multiplication (which differs very greatly with 
the different forms of insect life) two rather striking examples may 
be cited. I have shown that, with the common house fly, a single 
overwintering female may have, between April 15 and September 10, 
5.598,720,000.000 descendants. This seems almost incredible, but, 
given larval food, it is possible. It is not, however, great as are the 
figures, as startling as the estimate made by Prof. G. W. Herrick of 
Cornell, of the ponderable mass of the descendants of a single cab- 
bage aphis in Central New York in less than a year. Although a 
single aphis weighs little more than a milligram, the ponderable 
mass of its descendants in less than a year would be more than 822,- 
000,000 tons! In pounds, this would be 1,044,000,000,000. Esti- 
mating the human population of the world at 2,000,000,000 and the 
average weight at the exaggerated figure of 150 pounds, the total 
human weight would be 300,000,000,000 pounds. In other words, the 
plant-lice descended from one individual of one species in a single 
season would weigh more than five times as mucii as all the people 
of the world. Of course, in this estimate we must grant the existence 
of food enougli for this mass, which of course is imi)ossible. 

I have .spent the larger part of my time during the past two years 
in writing a history of applied entomology, and it is interesting to 



398 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

rote how little attention has been paid in the past to the insect prob- 
lem, except for occasional great emergencies like swarms of migra- 
tory grasshoppers, and at the same time how the problem has been 
growing. Undoubtedly, wherever a center of human civiliz:\tion had 
its beginnings, just as soon as food began to be grown on a sufficient 
scale to feed many people, certain injurious insects began to increase 
in number. New opportunities for their increase were being offered 
to them — their increase was really being encouraged. If we had the 
records of lost civilizations, no doubt these losses by insects would 
appear ; and it is quite within the bounds of possibility that insects 
have aided in the destruction of past civilizations — such, for ex- 
ample, as those that existed in Central America. Little attention 
was paid to insects, however, except when great outbreaks occurred, 
until within the last 170 years; and then for more than 100 years 
insects were studied by a few men here and there simply as a part 
of the animal kingdom. They were brought into collections, and 
classified and named. Their study, however, was considered a trivial 
pursuit. Within the past 70 years, however, a new type of entomol- 
ogist has appeared — the economic entomologist, and there has grown 
up rapidly an increased appreciation of the importance of the study 
of insects; and the economic entomologists have been increasing 
rapidly in number, particularly during the present century. The 
United States has led in this work, and perhaps still leads in the 
number of persons engaged in entomological research with its eco- 
nomic applications distinctly in view. But other countries are 
rapidly coming to the front. Entomological problems have seemed 
more important in the newer countries. The dominions and colonies 
of the great British Empire have, therefore, felt a greater need for 
entomological research than most other parts of the globe, with the 
exception of the United States, and there has been built up in the 
British Empire many strong research bodies centered in an Imperial 
Bureau in London. 

But possibly it is not the dramatic outbreaks of a comparatively 
few spectacularly injurious species that bring about the greatest loss. 
Take agriculture in Europe, for example, where, on account of the 
small holdings and close methods of cultivation, these great out- 
breaks rarely get a start. It has become the custom to estimate a 
normal crop for a certain piece of land. But it seems to the writer 
that the so-called normal crop would be greatly enhanced if all un- 
noticed insect damage were eliminated. There are undoubtedly min- 
ute unnoticed insects that are constantly lowering productiveness; 
there are millions of tiny jaws and beaks gaining nourishment from 
cultivated plants. There must be some way of destroying these crea- 
tures and of thus minimizing this damage. 



MAN AND INSECTS — HOWARD 390 

Moreover, there are bacterial diseases of plants and diseases 
caused by other microorganisms. Upon such diseases tliere has been 
built up a great branc-h of applied science known in this country as 
phytopathology.- But it is beginning to be realized that possibly the 
majority of these plant diseases are carried and spread by insects, and 
therefore the control of insects becomes doubly important. 

We have not attempted so far to particularize the broad nature ot 
tlie harm done by insects to the human species. Not only do they 
consume from 10 to 20 per cent of everything that we try to grow, 
but they feed upon practically all the storeil foods and upon an 
infinite number of materials that are of use to us. They also affect 
seriously the health of man and of all domestic animals; and by the 
carriage of disease, not only to man but to plants, they intensify 
greatly the problem as it appeared to us only a few years ago. 

Tliere is no doubt in my mind that the human species, with its 
intelligence, will eventually meet this great problem, and that it will 
bring insect life under control, but down to the present time the 
problem has comparatively been ignored. In future, not only must 
the minds of scientific men turn in this direction, but many more men 
must be educated in such a way as to enable them to conduct profit- 
able research; and, what is more, we must face the fact that we must 
study our present ways of doing things and particularly our present 
ways of growing food, and that we must make radical changes in 
order to bring about the best results. 

Intelligence will win out in the long run; but the hunuin species 
must turn aside in its race and concentrate a great deal of its " God- 
given " intelligence on its strongest rival, the insects. 

* In Europe, the term phytopathology Is applied to damage done by iusecta as well as 
by parasitic microorganisms and viruses. 



THE USE OF FISH POISONS IN SOUTH AMERICA 



By Eluswouth P. Kilop, United States National Museum, aiul Ai.ueut C.

[With 5 plates] 



The Indians who live along the Amazon Kiver and its numerous 
tributaries have many ways of capturing lish, one of their staple 
foods. Some of these are ancient methods, handed down from gen- 
eration to generation; others have come from recent contacts with 
civilization. There is still-fishing, the natives fashioning hooks 
from the thorns of plants and from bones, or when tlie white man's 
jjroducts have reached them, using manufactured steel hooks. Nets 
of various kinds are much employed, some 1-man circular affairs that 
require great dexterity to cast, others rectangular nets drawn through 
the water by several men. Some times the fish are shot with arrows 
or are speared. Along the lower Amazon, where the tide reaches 
up from the Atlantic, enclosures are constructed of palm stems, 
within which the fish are stranded as the tide ebbs. A most modern 
method is used in regions lying in close contact with the commerce 
of the world; dynamite is hurled into quiet pools, the natives tlien 
diving after the stunned fish or retrieving them downstream by 
forming a human barricade at a shallow stretch. 

But perhai)s the most interesting type of fishing is the old native 
custom of throwing portions of plants into the water to stupefy 
the fish, a procedure practiced since earliest times by primitive 
people tliroughout the world and often mentioned by early exi)lorers 
of the Americas. AVith the spread of civilizatioji, the area of this 
usage is becoming more and more limited. So great is the destruc- 
tion of fish, small as well as large, that decrees proliibitiug the 
" j)oisoning " of streams have been ])ronmlgated, and where the ad- 
ministrative authority has been sufficiently strong tliis method has 
been abandoned. Therefore, to observe this curious method of fish- 
ing with plants, to sec the plants actually being cultivated for this 
l^urpose, and to make a thorough study of these materials, one nmst 
penetrate into tlie more remote parts of the world. 

Ample opportunity was had to carry on such investigations by 
members of a botanical expedition recentlyl sent by the Smithsonian 
Institution to northeastern Peru and Amazoiiian Brazil. Reports 
on the general botanical work accompiislu-d on t!ie trip have been 

401 



402 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

published ^ by the -writers ; in the present paper we propose to deal 
exclusively with our investigations of fish-poison plants. 

The principal object of the expedition was the making of botanical 
collections in the low-lying forested parts of eastern and northeast- 
ern Peru, known as the montafia. Little botanical exploration had 
been done in that region ; the small amount that has been carried on 
has mainly been that of European botanists, as Spruce, Poeppig, 
Ule, and Tessmann, and their collections have been deposited in 
European institutions. The party consisted of Mr. William J. 
Dennis, of the University of Iowa, and the writers, and the general 
route taken was as follows : Brief stops were made along the Pacific 
coast of Peru, at Talara and Salaverry, the port of Trujillo, and at 
Lima. From Lima we ascended the cordillera, and proceeded south 
along this to Huancayo and Huanta. A three weeks' trip took the 
party over to the Apurimac River, in the montana, and back to 
Huanta. Reaching the Chanchamayo Valley by way of Tarma, we 
then worked slowly over the Pichis Trail, and down the Pichis, 
Pachitea, and Ucayali Rivers to Iquitos, a city on the Amazon in 
the extreme northeastern part of Peru. Here the party separated 
temporarily, Mr. Dennis ascending the Maranon River as far as 
the rapids of Manseriche, the writers going up the Huallaga River 
to Yurimaguas and working from there west to Balsapuerto, at the 
base of the Ancles. The return trip from Iquitos was by way of the 
Amazon River and the Atlantic, with short stops at the Brazilian 
towns of Manaos, Para, and Gurupa. This circuitous trip from 
Lima to Para, covering nearly G,000 miles, gave us a fine opportunity 
not only to study fish-poison plants but also to discover how little 
really was known about them outside of the region in which they 
were actually used. 

This method of fishing does not seem to be employed in western 
Peru, perhaps because of the enforcement of prohibitory laws, per- 
haps because of the absence of small lakes or slow-moving streams 
suited to its use. All we learned at Talara and Trujillo was that 
Indians in the interior used plant roots for fishing. In Lima there 
was a surprising lack of information about this means of fishing 
and about the plants so used. At the University of San Marcos 
there were a few roots on exhibition labeled cuie and said to be a 
fish poison of the interior. Dr. August Weberbauer, the eminent 
botanist of Lima, told us that along the Perene River the Indians 
used I'ephi'Osia toxicaria in fishing. This is a plant of rather wide 
distribution in the Tropics of the New World, and its use as a fish 
poison was well known. We felt, however, that it was not the true 
cube of which we had heard.

FISH POISONS KELLIP AND SMITH 403 

At Himncayo, a city situatcil in tlu' Mantaro Valley at an elevation 
of about 11,000 feet, cube roots were on sale in many shops. They 
were brought to Iluancayo by natives from the montana. and no 
stems with leaves or flowers were present with the roots to permit 
identification of the plant. We learned that water treated with (nihe 
was sometimes used as a sheep dip in this re<];ion. Another plant 
used both as an insecticide and as a lish poison in the Mantaro 
Valley was tall hue ^ Lvpinns inutahilis Sweet {L. cmckshanksii A. 
Gray), ]ilantinps of which were seen near Huancayo. The seeds, 
[loisonous when uncooked, were made edible by boiling, the water 
(hen being used in cattle-delousing or in fishing. 

At Aina, several days of travel southeast of Huancayo and our 
first stop in the montana, we were shown a i)lant in cultivation 
called cube. It was clearly Tephrosia toxicarin,, and after much 
questioning we were told that farther inland there was another much 
more potent fish poison, cu'oe de almnhhi (starch cube). The plant 
at Aina was known as Tiiutuy cube, from its resemblance to the well- 
known dye plant. Indigofera futffruficosa, locally called mutuy. 

The trail we were following ended at Kimpitiriki, a small mission 
on the Apurimac River, and here for the first time we found the true 
cube plant. Near the mission lived a half-breed farmer, who culti- 
vated a small amount of cube for his own use. The plantation con- 
sisted of about 100 plants, placed in irregular row^s, with 10 feet or 
more between plants. Here the plants were slender erect trees, 
8 to 12 feet in height, with some of the upper branches scaudent. 
These were said to be 2 or 3 j'ears old, and the roots were used at the 
end of the fourth year (the roots only in this case, although some- 
times the stems also are used). 

The region is populated by scattered families of Campos Indians, 
and at the time some of the men had gone on an expedition up the 
Apurimac to obtain more cxibe root for a forthcoming fishing party. 
We could not ascertain whether they Avere seeking wild cuhe or 
whether they knew of other plantations upriver. 

As our plans called for covering a large area in the brief space 
of seven months, we were unable to explore further this immediate 
region. How much farther south this ])articular })lant is cultivated 
we do not know. From reports we judge that it is found all along 
the Apurimac River until that stream has attained an elevation of 
0,000 feet above sea level. At the higher altitudes in the Department 
of Apurimac this cube gives way to other fish poisons. Rei)or(s also 
indicate that it is unquestionably the same as the plant grown along 
the lower Apurimac and the Ene, the region from which roots are 
brought to Huancayo, 

Although the plants at Kimpitiriki were neither in flower nor in 
fruit, they were at once recognized as representing a species of the 



404 ANNUAL REPOPxT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 

tribe Dalbergieae, of the Fabaceac (Pea) family. Subsequent 
studies established its identity as Lonchocar'pus nicou (Aubl.) DC.^ 

The Chanchamayo Valley, which was next visited, lies east of 
Lima and across the Andes. So interesting was the vegetation here 
that a full month was spent in general collecting at La Merced and 
tlie Perene Colony, two important settlements in this valley, though 
(mly a single plantation of Lonchocarpus nicou was seen here. A 
family of Indians from the interior had taken over a chacra. as the 
small farms are called, and had set out a few branches of cube^ 
brought with them from their earlier home. From these some 50 
thriving plants had developed. Of special note is the fact that these 
plants were growing at about 4,100 feet, a higher altitude than 
observed elsewhere on the trip. 

The common fish poison of this region, however, was Tephrosia 
toxicana; indeed, along that part of the Perene River the Indians 
apparently use that plant exclusively. At the colony we obtained our 
first and only information of the use of Sapindaceae as fish poisons. 
An Austrian immigrant, who had lived many years among the 
Cashivi Indians to the northward, told of their using various species 
of a vine known by them as verap^ and he showed us three different 
species growing wild in the thickets near his house. These plants 
proved to be Serjania glahrata Kunth, Serjania rubicaulis Benth., 
and Se7'jania rufa Radlk. Along the Pichis mule trail, which begins 
at the Perene Colony, crosses a range at 6,000 feet altitude, and ter- 
minates at the Pichis lliver, Tephros'm toxicana alone among fish 
poisons was found, with the exception of a single plant of Loncho- 
carpus nicou at Santa Rosa, near the end of the trail. Along the 
Pichis, Pachitea, and Ucayali Rivers both of these and a third plant, 
Olihadiuni strigillosum Blake, called guaco^ were seen in cultivation, 
though in no case were the plantings extensive. Apparently the use 
of fish poisons is being given up along this main route of travel be- 
tween Lima and the Amazon, possibly from a more rigid enforcement 
of the laws, but more probably from an increasing use of dynamite. 
Usually in this region Lonchocarpus nicou was referred to as cohapi. 
Iquitos, the capital of the Department of Loreto, 2,400 miles from 
the mouth of the Amazon and yet with an altitude of only about 
325 feet, proved to be the center of the cultivation of Lonchocarpus 
nicou. From here westward as far as the rapids of Manseriche and 
Balsapucrto this appeared to be one of the commonest of cultivated 
plants; indeed, with the exception of bananas, plantains, and yuca, 
it was probably the most commonly cultivated plant. In this region, 
and in fact at all points north of the Chanchamayo, the name cute 
was never used. Barhasco^ the general word for fish-poison plants in

FISH POISONS — KILI^IP AND SMITH 405 

Spanisli-speaking countries, was applied to all fish poisons, though 
Lonchocai'pus nicou was soniotinies ,si)()ken of as havhasco Icgitimo. 
The word harhasco is said to bo derived from Ycrhascum^ a genus of 
Scrophulariaceous plants used formerly in Spain ami other European 
countries as fish poisons. From this we have also t »iJ>arha.<icar, to 
fish with poisonous plants, and barha^scaJ, a plantation ui)on which 
fish poisons are grown. 

The harhaj^caJcs of Lonchorarpxtfi nicou vary greatly in size from 
small rlearings of 2.") (o 100 i)lants, intended to meet the wants of 
a single Indian and his family, to large plantings of as many as 
10.000 trees, the .source of supjily for a whole neighborhood. This 
species grows best in fairly open, well-diained, sandy soil, and is 
propagated by means of cuttings, a piece of the stem about a foot 
long being placed horizontally a few inches below the surface. The 
cuttings grow rapidly, and at the end of the fourth year the plants 
may be as much as 15 feet high. In general appearance they greatly 
resemble coffee plants, the individual leaflets, indeed, having much 
the shape of the leaves of Coffnca arahrca. There is a central main 
stem or trunk, which in the young stages of growth is erect. Later, 
if there is a tree trunk available for support, the uppvr part of the 
stem may bend toward it and climb upward to a height of 50 feet 
or more. This accounts for the varying descriptions of cube given 
during the early part of our trip as a tree and a vine. The roots 
are usually dug at the end of the second, third, or fourth year. 
The root system of a single individual is very large; one from a 
plant 2 years old weighed 3 pounds when fresh and II/2 pounds 
when dry. 

In spite of prohibitions concerning it, harhasco is used by both 
aborigines and Spanish-Peruvians. It was our good fortune to 
attend a fishing party whicii took place on one of the streams empty- 
ing into the Huallaga. Such an affair is an occasion for gayety 
and excitement. An arm of the stream or a small lagoon wliere 
the current is not swift is chosen and on the appointed morning 
two or three hundred people assemble. Some come from consid- 
erable distance, afoot or by canoe. The canoes are substantial 
craft made of a single tree trunk capable of carrying several 
people. 

Some participants bring large baskets of harhasco roots, others 
who are less provident come empty-handed to enjoy the fun or to 
get an undeserved share of fish. Many families make temporary 
camps along the shore, and everyone is in good humor. The hai-hasco 
is chopped into small pieces with a machete and .several basket fuls 
are emptied into each canoe. It is then covered with water until 
the canoe is about a qnartei- full. The men and boys tread this 
28095—31 27 



406 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

mixture with their feet until it becomes grayish white in color. 
Evidently it has no effect on external abrasions; in fact, it is some- 
times taken internally in small amounts as medicine. 

When all is ready the canoes are distributed over the proposed 
area and at a signal each participant empties his mixture into 
the lagoon with a calabash. The harhmco left in the bottom of 
the canoe can be mixed with more water and a second somewhat 
weaker solution formed. Gradually the quiet water takes on a milky 
tinge. 

After a few minutes, small fish appear on the surface, struggling 
in an inebriated manner. These are neglected by the fishers and 
soon float quietly in death; this careless slaughter of innumerable 
young fish is the chief objection to the use of poisons. Soon the 
larger fish are affected; the dying struggles of these cause con- 
siderable excitement and rivalry. Canoes are propelled to and fro 
across the agitated lagoon, each with one or more spearsmen in the 
bow. The spears, equipped with two or three metal prongs, are 
jabbed into the fish, which are dextrously flipped into the canoe 
one after another. Shouts of laughter and encouragement fill the 
air; both paddlers and spearsmen enter into the competition, and 
many prizes are stolen from beneath the spear of a friendly 
rival. Along the shores, children emulate their elders by jabbing 
the neglected small fry. 

After a few tense minutes the lagoon is " cleaned out " ; only the 
very large and wary fish are left, the poison having become too diluted 
to do further damage. The precise effect of the poison is not known, 
but it is apparentlj'^ external. In some way the gills cease to func- 
tion, and the fish act as though paralyzed. Some observers have 
noted a dilation of the eyes. A fish which is only partly paralyzed, 
upon being placed in fresh water, will often recover. 

Gradually the assemblage disperses, with the prospect of a few 
hearty meals in the near future. It is said that fish thus obtained 
can not be kept as long as those otherwise caught, but they are 
unharmed for immediate consumption. Usually the catch is too 
large, and the ensuing waste is another score against this method. 

By far the greater part of Lonchocarpus nicou seen was in culti- 
vation. Only a few scattered plants which we took to be this spe- 
cies were found truly wild in the forests. This wild plant is called 
sacha harhasco by the natives, and there was a difference of opinion as 
to its effectiveness as a fish poison. Some stated that it was never 
used ; others that it was sometimes used but was much less powerful 
than the cultivated plant. Perhaps the wild plants represent a 
species closely related to Lonchocarpus nicou, the true plant not 
being native in Peru; or perhaps the cultivated plant is a selected 
strain in which the poison content of the roots is particularly strong. 



PISH POISONS — KILLIP AND SMITH 407 

Curiously not a single plant, cultivated or wild, was found in flower 
or fruit. That this was not due to our trip having been made out 
of season is evidenced by the univei-sal testimony of owners of ])lan- 
tations, whose powers of observation are remarkably keen, that the 
plant " did not have flowers." We can only suggest certain explana- 
tions for this condition. Possibly the plant does not flower until 
after several years of growth when it has become a high-climbing 
liana. As the trees in actual cultivation are dug at the end of the 
third or fourth year, the great majority of the plants that we saw 
or that were seen by natives with whom we came in contact were 
not old enough to produce flowei*s. Or possibly during centuries 
of cultivation it has been found that the poison content is more po- 
tent in nonllowering individuals. 

Other plants cultivated as fish poisons in the Iquitos region and 
along the lower Ilualhiga Kiver are Tephros'ia toxkaria^ here some- 
times called tirano harhasco, and CHhadluiii aylvestre and C. hetero- 
trichum, both known as guaco or hiMca. 

Our trip across Brazil was unfortunately a hurried one, and we 
made no thorough study of fish poisons. Questioning of the natives 
who live along the banks of the Amazon brought little information 
about the practice. It was only after painstaking search during stops 
at Manaos, Para, and Gurupa tliat we were able to see the plants 
growing. A few scattered plants of L. nicou were found near these 
settlements. Near Manaos there was a planting of over a thousand 
shrubs of another species of Lanchocarpus^ L. flonhundus Benth., 
the roots of which were said to be very effective as a fish poison. 
These plants were in fine flower and fruit. At Gurupa on the lower 
Amazon, there was a third species, Lonchocarpus uruca Killip and 
Smith, which was considered to be even more powerful than Loncho- 
carpus nicou. Other fish poisons cultivated about Para were Te- 
phrosia tooeicaria^ Tephrosia eviarginata^ and Clihadmin sylvestre. 
On our entire Amazon trip we learned nothing of the many other 
plants mentioned by Martins and Kadlkofer as being used to obtain 
fish. Here, as in many other places, this mode of fishing is being 
abandoned because of prohibitory laws. At Manaos all agreed 
that the Indians of the upper Rio Negro and the Rio Branco used 
plants almost exclusively in fishing. 

In Amazonian Brazil the prevailing name for fish poisons was 
timbo, modifications of this being used for the different plants, as 
thnho legithiio for Lonchocarpus Jiicou, tltnho urucu for Z. urucu^ 
timho cururd for L. rariflorus^ a conmion plant though apparently 
not used as a fish poison, and tinibo de Cayenne for Tephroaia 
toxicaria. 

•In our previous paper we referred to this plant as Oracca nitons (Tephroaia nitent), 
the name commonly used for this close relative of T. toricuriu in the lower Ama/un 
region. True Tephroaia nitent apparently is dlstincL 



408 ANNUAL REPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

On this trip across Peru and Brazil we saw therefore 11 different 
kinds of plants that were said to be used in fishing. These consti- 
tute only a small part of the total number of species reported as 
South American fish poisons, fliough we believe that Lonchocarpus 
nicou and perhaps Tephrosla toxicaria are among the most com- 
monly used ones, at least in the northern half of the continent. Far- 
ther south in Brazil the prevailing fish poisons belong to Serjania 
and PaulUnia^ of the family Sapindaceae. 

Several lists of fish poisons have been compiled, the earliest being 
that of the distinguished Venezuelan botanist Ernst,* who included 
26 species from South America. Papers by Radlkofer,^ Greshoff,^ 
and Howes ^ brought the total known from South America to about 
100. 

There has been a revival of interest in this ancient custom due to 
the discovery that many fish poisons contain substances that may 
prove of high value in the manufacture of insecticides. So great 
is the damage wrought upon cattle and crops by the hordes of in- 
sect pests that chemists are ever on the lookout for efiective weapons 
to fight them. When experiments are concluded it may be found 
that the roots used by primitive peoples to obtain an important 
element of their diet are the means of conserving the food supply 
of the more highly civilized races.

A RARE PARASITIC FOOD PLANT OF THE SOUTHWEST 



By FUANK A. TUACKEUV 

Senior Ayricultui i.st. United i^latcs Dcijartinetit of Ayficulture 

and 

M. Frencu Oilman 
Collaborator, United Stittes Deijurtmcnt of Ayrieulture 



[With plates] 



The rare and interesting plant Ammohroma sonorae Torr. is found 
only in the sand dunes of the southwestern United States and north- 
ern Sonora and Lower California. Mexico, where the rainfall 
averai;:es only about 2 to 5 inches per annum and where there are 
sometimes periods as long as three years with practically no rain. 

Apparently, when plenty of moisture is made available by winter 
or spring rains the plant grows very rapidly and is able, by stealing 
from its host and by means or its own roots, to store suflicient moisture 
in its long, fleshy, succulent stalk to mature and reproduce seed in 
its chosen home in the sand dunes. In dry seasons this parasite is 
extremely rare in the sand dunes of Imperial County, Calif., but if 
the winter months have plenty of rain it is likely to be plentiful 
there during the months of March, April, May, and June. The 
larger and better specimens were collected by us in late May and 
early June following a wet winter season. 

Just how this parasitic plant nudces its contact with the host root, 
usually from 2 to 5 feet below the surface, forms a most interesting 
subject which we are now attempting to solve. 

The word Ammobroma is derived from two Greek words, amnio 
(sand), Iji'omos (food). The Papago Indians, who have used this 
plant for foofl from time immemorial, call it biatatk {hki — sand or 
sand hills — and tatk — root). 

It is a root parasite and belongs to the family Lennoaccae which 
is usually ])laced next to the Hricacear, or Heath family. There are 
only two genera of this family represented in the United States,

having its flowers in a spike (as a flowering head), while the flower 
head of the latter is a flat or saucer-shaped disk. The calj'x of 
Pholisma is smooth, whereas that of Ammobroiiia is quite hairy and 
the two parasites appear to have different host plants. 

Ammobroma is found in the sand dunes between Imperial Valley, 
Calif., and Yuma, Ariz., and although fairly numerous in spots, 
appeared not to be widely distributed, even though much apparently 
suitable territory was explored. Our first examination of this plant 
was on April 1, 1928, following a wet winter, and thereafter visits 
to the locality were made at frequent intervals up to July 31, 1929. 
The plant was found growing in almost pure sand of a pale buffy 
color, and in the case of the best specimens the roots were found to be 
in moist sand. Where the sand was dry at the point of contact with 
the host root the stalks of the parasite were flabby and wilted. They 
were found more abundant and in better condition in the depressions 
between the sand dunes or at other points where it was evident that 
more moisture was available. 

The flower heads were flat on the ground, and their similarity in 
color to the sand caused them to be easily overlooked by a casual 
observer. There were usually four to eight heads from a single con- 
tact on the host root. These heads frequently appear on the surface 
several feet from the host plant, but they are sometimes closer and 
occasionally even partially under the branches of the host. 

Ammobroma was not reported from California until recently al- 
though it was collected in Sonora, Mexico, in 1854 by Col. A. B. 
Gray and again either in Arizona or in Lower California, Mexico, in 
1858 by Carl Schuchard. In May, 1903, T. S. Brandegee reported 
Ammobroma from California (collected by Alfred Stockton near the 
Colorado River). 

It was reported again in April, 1925, by W. L. Jepson from the 
Colorado desert in California (Ogilby near Hedges Mine). 

Through the interest of Mr. D. S. Hunt (known locally as " Peg- 
leg "), this rare plant, growing in the sand dunes of Imperial County, 
Calif., was brought to the attention of Dr. O. F. Cook a few years 
ago, and in March, 1928, was shown to Mr. Carl S. Scofield. Mr. 
Scofield collected specimens of young flowering heads and showed 
them to Dr. Walter T. Swingle at the United States Date Garden, 
Indio, Calif., in the latter part of March, 1928. Doctor Swingle de- 
tailed us to make a thorough study of the plant and in particular to 
ascertain its host plant. 

Before maturity, the heads are like a flat disk with a slight depres- 
sion in the center, but as they grow older the top becomes more 
convex, or saucer shaped, and some even approach a funnel shape. 
When young, the disk appears entire, but may later form folds, or 
lobes, and in some cases may even split into several parts, radiating 



A PARASITIC PLANT — THACKERY AND OILMAN 411 

from the center and ajrain dividing as the circumference is ap- 
proached. Tliis formation seems to take place as the seed vessels 
develop and may come from pressure of the growing capsules. The 
edges of the flower head are curled under, and at maturity each ray, 
in cases where the split occurs, resembles a scape with the persistent 
flowers on the upper side. The first flowers open near the center, the 
later ones toward the outside, until the last ones appear near the outer 
edge. The rays into which (he inlloroscence ^^plits vary in width ac- 
cording to the size of the disk or the number of the divisions. 

The flower heads, or disks, were from 11/2 to 5 inches in diameter 
and about an inch or a little less in thickness. We found one head, 
however, which measured 8 inches in diameter. The flowers form 
a scattered circle around the center and in later openings, as stated, 
approach the outside, thus forming successive irregular circles of 
flowers. The flower is tubular in shape with a spread of about 
one-eighth of an inch, and is about three-eighths of an inch in 
length. The corolla lobes are from six to nine, or occasionally even 
more, although G, 7, and 8 seem the most common numbers. The 
flower is amparo purple and the throat a hortense violet color 
(Ridgeway's Color Manual), and the margin is white. The filiform 
sepals are light purple in color with numerous plumose silvery hairs 
on the upper side which tend to mass or felt at the surface of the 
flower head, making a soft, velvety surface. 

The capsule is shaped like a tiny flat onion, slightly larger than 
an ordinary pinhead. When mature, it splits horizontally around 
the equatorial circumference, disclosing a circle of tiny seeds, 
usually 16 in number. These seeds are shaped like a segment of 
a tangerine orange and are brown in color, with a rough or pitted 
surface. As far as could be determined from an examination of our 
specimens, seed matured from less than half of the flowers. The 
base, or foundation of the disk, which might be called the receptacle, 
was light purple and faded to a brown as the plant matured. By 
soaking this colored substance in water, it appeared to us brown, 
instead of the expected purple color. 

Much difiiculty was encountered in digging the plants because 
fresh sand, which was dry most of the way dow^n, kept sliding back 
into the hole almost as fast as it could be thrown out, so that in each 
instance when the work was finally done, we had a funnel-shaped 
hole, several feet across and usually from 3 to 5 feet in depth. To 
add to the difficulty, the long fleshy stalks of the best specimens of 
Ammobroma, usually from 1 to V/o inches in diameter, were so 
tender and brittle that they had to be supported by one man while 
the other did the digging. The stalks were whitish in color, sparsely 
clothed with scales about an inch long and an eighth of an inch 
wide, but as the stalks mature the scales take on a tan color. The 



412 ANNUAL, BEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

scales increase in number and decrease in size from the root attach- 
ment to the top of the plant, changing from a brown color under- 
ground to a light purple as the head, or disk, is reached. The number 
of stalks branching from a single contact on the host root varied from 
one or two to as many as 25, but the usual number was from four to 
eight. 

Rarely did the stalks ascend perpendicularly from the contact 
point with host root, usually curving horizontally and then upward 
at various angles. The heads Avere sometimes close together at the 
surface, but usually as much as 3 or 4 feet apart. In some in- 
stances we found the stalk only part way to the surface and then, 
instead of a head, it had a sharp point for penetrating the sand. In 
one instance this sharp point had grown entirely through another 
Ammobroma stalk at right angles to it. 

The young, tender stalks were slightly enlarged soon after leav- 
ing the host root, and some of them showed an enlargement just 
below the surface of the sand. Many of the stalks had thrown out 
a few roots at the base, or point of contact with the host root, thus 
indicating an attempt to depart from pure parasitism. In a few 
cases, as shown by the photographs, there were many Ammobroma 
roots. When the stalks were in their prime they Avere very succu- 
lent, plump, and very tender and brittle, but as the moisture disap- 
peared and the heads matured, the stalks Avilted, decreased in diam- 
eter, and became flabby. Apparently the head forms just before it 
reaches the surface of the sand and then pushes its way up to the 
surface in a manner similar to the growth of a puffball or toadstool. 

When moisture is available under the conditions prevailing in the 
sand dunes of Imperial County, Calif., this parasite is able to store 
sufficient moisture and nutriment in its stalk to continue flowering 
well into the rainless summer months. We collected our largest and 
best heads on April 26, 1928, at a time Avhen no moisture could be 
detected in the sand at the point of contact with the host and the 
roots of the parasite appeared to be dead. The Ammobroma stalks 
Avere wilted, indicating that the heads had continued to grow and 
mature seed from tlie storage in the stalks. 

The disproportion betAveen the small nonsucculent Coldenia host 
and the heavy, fleshy and succulent parasite is very noticeable, the 
parasite often being many times the weight of the host. This is 
possible because the Ammobroma has its OAvn root system, enabling 
it rapidly to absorb Avater Avhen available in the sand of the dunes. 

The host plants of Ammobroma were not identified by Col. A. B. 
Gray, who discovered it near Adair Bay, Sonora, Mexico, on May 
17, 1854, nor by Carl Schuchard, who in May, 1858, between Pilot 
Knob and Cook's Well, collected the specimens Avhich were studied 
so carefully by Count Solms-Laubach. 



A PARASITIC PLANT — THACKEKY AND OILMAN 413 

111 18i)0, Dr. Edwiiiil Palmer collected Aiuiuobroina near Lerdo, 
Soiiora, Mexico, not far from the Arizona boiiiulary, and reported 
it parasitic on Fninseria duniosa (Compositae) Gray and Dalea (or 
Farosela) einoryl (Leguminoseae) Gray. The account of the col- 
lecting of the plant by Doctor Palmer is found in the Contributions 
from tlie United States National Herbarium, No. 1, June oO, IbUO., 
p. 27: 

Ammohroma aonorae, Torr. This wus lirst discovered in 1S54 by Col. A. B. 
Gray, iu charge of a railroad exploring party, at the head of the Gulf of Cali- 
fornia. At this time a short notice of the discovery was published by Col. 
.\. li. Gray in Memoirs of the American Academy of Science, but it was not 
until 1SG7 that a description of the genus was published by Dr. John Torrey 
in the Aimnls of Lye. Nat. Hist. N. Y. Vol. YIII, p. 51, together with a good 
tigure. So far as we cau learn the plant was not collected again until Schu- 
chard got it in Arizona. And now Doctor Palmer collected it in lai-ge quan- 
tities at Lerdo, Mexico. Until the present season its host plant has been 
unknown but Doctor Palmer has carefully examined into this, anil collected 
two common plants of this arid region upon which it grows. These are Fran- 
seria dumosa and Dalea emoryi. Doctor Palmer wrote that the plant grows 
in deep sand, the deeper the sand the larger and juicier the plants. The Cocopa 
Indians gather them for food, which they relish under all circumstances. They 
eat it raw, boiled, or roasted. The plant is full of moisture, and whites and 
Indians alike resort to it in traveling, as a valuable substitute for water. It 
has a plea<;ant taste, much resembling the sweet potato. The stems are 2% 
feet long and 1 to 4 inches in diameter, but almost buried, only the peculiar 
white tops appearing above the sand. The Cocopa Indians call it " Oyutch." 
Colonel Gray gave nmch the same report of this plant. He says the Papago 
Indians dry the stems and grind them with the mesquite beans, forming what 
they call " pinole." 

In this same publication, under the heading " Head of the Gulf of 
California," also on page 27, appears the following: 

Three days were spent at Lerdo, Mexico. This is 60 miles south-southwest 
from Yuma, latitude 31° 40' 10", and longitude 114° 43' 30". 

The most interesting plant found here was Ammobroma, wliicli for the first 
time has been collected in good quantity. 

Since Doctor Palmer's time, no further information has been 
forthcoming as to the hosts of this parasitic plant, which in the 
meantime had been reported from Ogilby, Calif., near Hedges Mine, 
by "W. L. Jepson in his book ''A Manual of the Flowering Plants of 
California," page 735, published April 14, 1925. 

In the sand dunes ea.st of Holtville in Imperial County, Calif., we 
found Ammobroma parasitic on Cohlenhi plicata^'^ (Torr.) Cov. and 
Coldenia palmeri Torr. (Boraginaceae) and more rarely on Enogo- 
num deserticolum Wats. (Polygonaceae). We did not see any

Franseria species growing where the Ammobroma was found but we 
did find a considerable number of Dalea {Parosela) emovyi^ none, 
however, showing it as host to Ammobroma. 

In number of plants harboring the root parasite, Coldenia ycHmeri 
easily led with about 80 per cent of those found. Coldenia plicata 
came next with about 19 per cent, and Eriogonum deserticolum sup- 
ported the parasite in only three instances of the many examined 
by us. Coldenia palmeri was more numerous than Coldenia plicata 
but not in as great a percentage as the relative infestation would 
indicate. 

The two species of Coldenia mentioned herein are quite common 
in the arid and sandy portions of the Southwestern United States. 
Under favorable growing conditions, Coldenia palmeri Torr. often 
appears semispherical, sometimes spreading as much as 21/^ feet 
and reaching a height of 1 foot. In dry seasons it presents a very 
ragged aj^pearance and makes little, if any, growth, depending upon 
the amount of moisture available. Its roots are very dark in color 
and extend comparatively long distances into the sandy soil. When 
the sand of the dunes of Imperial County contained moisture, we 
noticed frequent enlargements of the Coldenia roots, indicating a 
tendency to store moisture when available. It shows much better 
growth where richer soil is available than that to be found in the 
sand dunes, but apparently Ammobroma prefers almost pure sand. 

Eriogonum deserticolum Wats, was quite numerous but seemingly 
not a suitable host. One contact found on Eriogonum was notable 
in that 25 Ammobroma stalks were growing from a single contact 
on one root of the host, the largest number found from one plant. 
However, the stalks were small and wilted and the heads were also 
small and not well developed. The depth was less than the average, 
being only a little over 2 feet, while the average for Ammobroma 
on Coldenia was between 2i/2 to 4 feet, one extreme depth being 5 
feet. This particular case was impressed upon us by the labor 
entailed in digging it out in the hot desert sunshine with the tempera- 
ture at about 105°. A careful search failed to reveal any other 
plants utilized as host, although representatives of other genera 
were fairly abundant in the immediate locality, among which may 
be mentioned: Covillea glutinosa Kydb., Ephedra tvifurca Torr., 
Abronia villosa Wats., Var. au7'ita Jepson, Mentzellia tnulti-fiora 
Gray, Stillingia annua Muell., Palafoxia linearis Lag., Parosela 
emo7'yi Gray, Petalonyx tliur-hevi Gra}^, Oenothera trichocalyx 
Nutt., Oenothera scapoidea T. &. G., and Dicoria canescens T. & G. 

The Papago and other Indians of the southwestern United States 
regard this plant very highly as food. Where Ammobroma was 
found, we noted many pieces of broken Indian pottery, some of it 
worn very thin by blown sand. Ammobroma was discovered by Col. 



A PARASITIC PLANT — THACKERY AND OILMAN 415 

A. B. Gray near Adair Bay, or Pinacate Mountain, in the State of 
Sonora, Mexico, in May, 1851. On this occasion he had with him a 
Papago Indian chief, who gathered some of this plant and roasted it 
on the coals of his camp fire. In describing its food value, Colonel 
Gray says : 

We encnmpod for the nisht in the sand hills, and the chief, Instead of sup- 
ping with us as usual, made a fire and roasted his roots or plants on the hot 
coals (which took about 120 minutes), and commenced eating them. None of 
the party seemed inclined to taste, but out of curiosity I moved over to the 
chiefs Are, and he hajidi>d me one. At llrst I ate but little and slowly, but 
in a few minutes so luscious was it that I forgot my own mess and nte 
heartily of it; next morning each of the party "followed suit," and after- 
wards there was scarcely enough gathered to satisfy us. The taste, though 
peculiar, was not unlike the sweet potato, but more delicate. 

We liked it better raw than cooked ; hoAvever, we did not try it 
roasted on coals as described by Colonel Gray. We found it quite 
palatable and apparently nutritious. Gray, Palmer, and Lumholtz 
agree that when roasted on the coals Indian fashion it resembles 
the sweet potato in taste. 

Mr. Carl Lumholtz, who many years later found this same plant 
at about the same locality, says of it : 

I sampled one of them and found it to be a succulent and excellent food. 
It is more tender than a radish, as well as much more Juicy, and the whole root 
can be eaten. It has a ."sweetish and agreeable flavor all its own. The Indians 
usually toast these plants on the coals, when they resemble sweet potatoes 
In taste, but I prefer to eat them raw. They are an especially delicious 
relish to a thirsty man, and they also quickly appease hunger; in fact, of all 
the many kinds of edible roots that I have tried in their uncooked state, use<l 
among natives in different parts of the earth, I know of none which can com- 
pare with this one in refreshing and palatable qualities. 

On the occasion of Colonel Gray's discovery of this plant, May 17, 
1854, he says: 
No rain had fallen there for six months, it being the dry season. 

Mr. Lumholtz visited this same locality in March, 1910, and he 
says: 

I had heard much of this plant for even the Mexicans relish the camote of 
the medanos. as they call it, but the iiast rainless winter had held out little 
hope that my desire to see it would be realized. 

From this it would appear that both Gray and Lumholtz found 
considerable numbers of this plant following very dry seasons. Mr. 
Lumholtz further indicates that the plant in the Pinacate region is 
availal)le to the Indians as food through the whole year for in speak- 
ing of the "Sand-dune Papago Indians" he says: 

They found good e<lible plant food in the dune.s, especially Aramobroma 
sonorae. the wonderful camotes which the Indians knew how to gather nil 
Ihe year round, thcjugh after May that part of the plant which is above RrouiKl 
withers away. 



416 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

The experience of the authors, resulting from frequent examina- 
tions of this plant from April 1, 1928, to July 31, 1929, as it grows 
in the sand dunes of Imperial County, Calif., indicates that the 
Ammobroma of that locality dries up during the dry seasons; in fact, 
but two single specimens were found in the spring of 1929 and both 
of these were attached to Eriogonutn deserticolv/m Wats., a much 
larger and more drought -resistant shrub than either of the Coldenias, 
which to Ammobroma appear preferable as host plants. 

During the dry season (ISIarch to June, 1929) we traced many dry 
stalks of the Ammobroma of the previous season down through the 
sand to the contact with the root of the host plant and in only two 
cases did we find any life in the Ammobroma and then only a very 
little within 1 or 2 inches of the point of contact. However, the 
difference in our experience and that of Gray and Lumholtz may be 
due to the fact that the Ammobroma of the Pinacate region of 
Sonora has a different host plant which may be better able to support 
Ammobroma through the dry seasons, or there may be more moisture 
in the sand where they found it. 

During the 1928-29 season the most common host plants for the 
Ammobroma of the Imperial County, Calif., sand dunes, the tw^o 
species of Coldenia herein mentioned, made little if any growth; in 
fact, the tops of most of them appeared to be practically dead. 

We have procured seed of the Ammobroma and scattered it near 
the Coldenia of the sand dunes in Riverside County (Coachella 
Valley), but so far no germinations have been noted.

THE MPXHANISM OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION

[With 1 pl:it(>| 



As "sve look over the avoiKI (o-tlay wc see, as the ancients did, 
the marvelous phenomenon of a world populated not only l»y Iniitians 
but also by many hundi'ed thousand so-called species of animals 
and plants existing in uncountable individuals whose numbers can 
no more be expressed by the ordinary system of numbering than 
astronomical distances can be readily expressed in miles. A cubic 
millimeter of the blood of a leucaemic mouse nuiy contain over a 
million white corpuscles, and there may well be 1,000 such cubic 
millimeters of blood in a mouse. This gives us a billion white cor- 
puscles in one mouse not to consider the other cells of the mouse's 
body. These white corpuscles are essentially organisms, with powers 
of food gathering, assimilation, excretion, locomotion, sensation, 
etc. And this is but one mouse. Even if we assume so few as 2i/2 
house mice to a human being on the earth (and mice are ubiquitous), 
and that each has oidy 10 million leucocytes, we shall have aO mil- 
lion billion white blood corpuscles in house mice alone. 

•J have sometimes speculated on the number of organisms visible 
to the low power of the microscope that are in our inner harbor - 
at the end of xVugust, when it has a creamy, souplike consistency. 
Assuming one per cubic millimeter, which is certainly far too small, 
there would be a quadrillion individuals in this space, which would 
occupy only a square millimeter in the one-millionth map of the 
world, which has over half a billion square millimeters. 

Pardon me for wearying you with figures. I have wanted to put 
you in a position to grant my first point that the niunber of ii^li- 
vidual organisms on the globe is essentially infinite, though the num- 
ber of kinds that naturalists have been able to count and describe in 
the past 150 years is still finite. 

Next, I would call to your attention that most of these individuals 
have a short life and are quickly replaced by others, even if we leave

out of account the unicellular organisms which retain their individu- 
ality only for the few hours or minutes necessary to reorganize and 
divide again. Even if we assume that the average length of life of 
an individual is a year — and it is probably not over a day — then we 
have to consider the remarkable phenomenon of an annual wiping 
off of the slate, as it were, of this infinitude of individuals each 
year and their re-formation the next year. This is possible owing to 
the immense reproductive capacity of certain species. Thus one 
oyster may lay 50,000,000 eggs during a few days in the summer and 
one sea urchin 20,000,000 eggs. These are samples, merely, of repro- 
ductive capacity of individuals. Perhaps now we have gained some 
conception of the number of individuals that have been produced 
each year on the earth, during we do not know how many millions 
of years. 

If now you are willing to admit that the problem of organic evo- 
lution is that of the evolution of an organic mass consisting of an 
infinitude of individuals reproduced during an infinitude of genera- 
tions, that may serve as a starting point to our inquiry as to the 
mechanism of organic evolution. 

Now, each individual has a certain recognizable form and acquires 
it through a certain course of development, be it more or less com- 
plex. The center of control of this form is largely, if not chiefly, in 
the chromosomes of the organic cells — in its genes, to be more pre- 
cise. In fact the soma of organisms, what we see, is just an index 
of the form producing and maintaining factors of the genes — al- 
ways, of course, recognizing that the end result is a sort of re- 
action between gene and environment. Now if the world of organ- 
isms is composed of an infinitude of kinds it is because the germ 
plasm is of an infinitude of kinds. The course of organic evolution 
has been and is what it is because the germ plasm has undergone 
and is undergoing the changes that it has undergone and is under- 
going. This change of the germ plasm is called mutation. Muta- 
tion is one of the great factors in organic evolution. 

Now what do we know about mutation? First, we know that it 
is widespread. This Imowleclge has first become precise as organ- 
isfils have been studied in successive generations, under controlled 
conditions. Such mutations have long been known among domesti- 
cated organisms like potatoes, poultry, guinea pigs, and dogs. Muta- 
tions have been so long known among domesticated organisms that 
it was natural for Darwin to discuss " Variation under Domestica- 
tion " and for him and others to consider what quality of domesti- 
cation it is that induces mutation. During the past 25 years in 
several species of animals taken from the wild, many generations 
have been followed. And in consequence we now know that muta- 
tion has no necessary relations to domestication; but only that 



ORGANIC EVOLUTION — DAVENPORT 419 

domestication enables us to see and perhaps preserve such muta- 
tions. Rather, I should say, the product of such mutation, for the 
mutation has occurred in the germ plasm before it has become visible 
in the soma of the organism that develops under the control of the 
mutated germ pla^m. 

Let us now consider some of the facts of mutation that experi- 
mental study has revealed. 

Fii-st, mutation is i)r()bably universally occurring in all germ 
plasms. Thus, in various mammals that have been reared so that 
they can be observed, mutation has occurred in all visible parts, in 
internal organs, and in resistance to disease. In man, which is the 
nuunmal that has been most thoroughly' studied, we have nmtations 
in hairiness, pigmentation, skin growths, appendages and digits, 
teeth, sense organs, form of internal organs, like the iliocecal valve, 
size and functioning of the endocrines, structure and functioning of 
the nervous system, of the blood and of the reproductive system. 
Finally, we have mutations in disease resistance, due to obscurer 
morphological or biochemical idiosyncracies. 

Among pigeons, mutations in color, form of beak, nervous be- 
havior have arisen in the Whitman-Riddle series. In poultry, I 
have in the course of 10 years got apparently new nmtations in toes, 
wings, and nervous reactions. And any poultry fancier knows of 
the mutations that have occurred in the past 7;"> years in color and 
pattern, in comb, in cerebral hernia and crest, in feet, wings and beak, 
and in egg-laying capacity. 

In the insects which have been bred for rapidity of generations 
mutation has been repeatedly found. In Drosophila^ Mullcr computes 
that among 500 factors in the X-chromosorae of Drosophila each, 
in the average, mutates at the rate of one mutation in four years. 
This would seem to mean that, if you followed a single chromosome 
and when it divided considered one of the daughter chromosomes and 
so proceeded through the generations, then at the end of four years 
the expectation is that in this line of chromosomes some one gene will 
have mutated and at the end of four more years that gene, or some 
other in the chromosome line we are following, will have mutated 
again. But there is an infinitude of chromosomes in the totality of 
all Drosophila melanog asters. The number in a single gonad is vast ; 
the number of gonads in the world of Drosophilas that swarm in the 
autumn over every mass of decaying fruit in a million of orchards as 
elsewhere is practically infinite. One sees that just Drosophila me- 
lanogastcr is producing an infinitude of mutations each season, and it 
has been producing this infinitude aimually for a long time; but time 
does not count for much, for infinity times a finite number remains 
infinity. Drosophila throws upon the world each year, a vast num- 
ber of kinds of mutations in inconceivably great numbers. 



420 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

And DrosopJiila is not exceptional. Let us take a small water crus- 
tacean, one of the Daphnids. Banta has reared lines of these in 
captivity and examined the progeny daily- In one line of Moina 
■macrocopa^ carried parthenogenetically, a dominant mutation has 
occurred, on the average, at least once in 50 generations, but many 
more recessive mutations have occurred and been phaenotypically un- 
expressed. Now the number of Daphnids, which crowd any suitable 
pond in both hemispheres during each spring and autumn, is beyond 
conception. For a single circular pond a hundred feet in diameter 
may well contain during the season many million Daphnids, if one is 
allowed to the cubic centimeter. The total of mutations that occur 
in one year in Moina macrocopa must be inconceivably great. 

Certain of the lower forms are mutating even more strikingly. At 
least such would seem to be the case if the remarkable variations 
shown by Leonian in the fungus, Fusariwn, may be regarded (as 
seems most probable) as mutations. Here scores of strains arise, in 
but a few years, even in a uniform culture medium, and perpetuate 
themselves. The strains vary in their rate of growth, pigment forma- 
tion, type of fruiting, kind of spores, and reactions toward tempera- 
ture, acids, dyes, and toxic substances. Apparently such mutation is 
going on all the time in nature. 

As we consider these best known cases of mutation and realize 
that all of the countless chromosomes and genes are undergoing 
occasional change we are appalled by the universality of mutation 
and are caused to wonder how any species remains constant in nature 
to the extent that it is possible for a second naturalist, 50 years later, 
to identify in nature the species already described; we are less sur- 
prised that the reviser of a genus a generation or two later will find 
twice as many species as his predecessor. We gain a lot of sympathy 
for the much abused species splitter who, observing nature without 
the restriction of tradition, finds vastly more species than had been 
previously described by his predecessors. 

Organisms seem to be producing mutations at an inconceivably 
rapid rate, in infinite quantity The wonder is that there are such 
things as species. One is led to inquire if, in describing species, tax- 
onomists are not merely inventing transient, evanescent categories. 

Such a conclusion is unjustified. Every taxonomist will tell you 
that the things he describes and others have described before him are 
real entities. If I am studying thrips and wish to secure a species 
described 50 years ago as living in a certain composite plant in eastern 
Russia, then if I go to the designated locality and look in the desig- 
nated species of flower I will find the species with all the characters 
described 50 or 100 thrips generations ago. How is such an experi- 
ence in constancy to be harmonized with universal mutation? This 
is perhaps the heart of the problem of evolution.

In considering the fixity of some species it must first of all be 
recognized tliat a species is a complex of morphological and physio- 
logical characters that can not exist alone but is absolutely dependent 
upon the external world for its existence. The organism must live in 
a medium of such and such physical qualities, at such a temperature, 
in the midst of such radiant energy, with access to such and such 
foodstull's which it is capable, of taking in and utilizing for its 
metabolism. Every organism is extraordinarily closely fitted to its 
environment. And that enviromnent may be very complex. 

I will illustrate this principle by reference to the almost micro- 
scopic Collembola that live on the beach at Cold Spring Harbor.

(Fig. 1.) They live in an area of apparently washed sand and peb- 
bles in a region that is covered twice a day several feet deep by sea 
water and then exposed to the air ; in a region swept by strong winds, 
overlaid by ice in winter, and exposed to the hot sun's rays in 
summer. (PI. 1.) A region where the sandy substratum is caused 
to shift by the action of waves, and its pebbles to roll. The region

are probably in the middle of summer a hundred million individuals. 
And they are meeting successfully the difficult and complex condi- 
tions imposed by that particular habitat. If the habitat be compared

422 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 



to a most intricate lock, the organism is a most intricate key that 
fits that lock completely. How has this key come to fit this lock? 

First of all, it is to be said that the Collembola in question is the 
only larger organism that is found in any huge numbers on and in 
the great portion of the beach. Worms there are that live in the sand 
of tlie beach ; Crustacea and insects there are that feed on the debris 
that is thrown up by the sea at the high tide line; but it is only 
the Collembola that swarm over the beach. (Fig. 2.) 

Why are the Collembola the 
only organisms that make such 
use of the beach? The answer 
seems to be that they are the 
only group that holds a key 
approximating the needs of 
the beach lock. Two other 
species of Collembola live on 
the edge of the beach, in rela- 
tively small numbers. But 
one, Isotoiaa herseldi^ has the 
combination of small size, 
slender form, and greater ca- 
pacity for jumping that are 
demanded for successful life 
on the beach. Another species 
which has a chunkier form 
and is less successful as a 
jumper is found on the beach 
but is much less numerous than 
the first. Now the Podurid 
Collembola have, in general, a 
structure and reactions that 
lead them to live in situations 
not so very different from 
those occupied by Isotonia. 
They are found on water or in humid earth or in moist caves, or in 
crevices of moist walls. If anything is to survive in the sand of the 
sea beach it must come out of a group wnth instincts and structure 
that make it possible and preferable to live in such places. However, 
the interstices of the sand of the beach are especially fine and the 
period of exposure to the air is so brief that the insect must have 
movements and responsiveness of such sort as will ensure adequate 
exercise and oxygenation of the tissues during the brief time that 
it is exposed to the air. Collembola, in general, have the right form 
of key ; Isotoma herselsii has precisely the appropriate notches to fit 
the precise lock of the beach.

ORGANIC EVOLUTION — DAVENPORT 423 

I have dwelt at length on the Collcmbohi of the hcacli because they 
may serve to ilhistrate the principle that mutations become the char- 
acters of sjiecies and play a part in evolution provided they meet 
some demand of the environment; or, the other way round, a new 
mutation persists as a species character if it can find an environment 
to which it is suited. 

This general principle is of wide application. In Banta's 
Daphnids there appeared a female whose young died on a cool day 
in the autumn. It was found that subsequent broods could be kept 
alive in an incubator at a higher temperature than that of the 
room. In short, an investigation of the temperature relations of 
these cold-sensitive 3'onng and their equally cold-sensitive descend- 
ants showed that there had arisen by mutation a thermal clone, a 
parthenogenetically reproducing strain, whose optimum temperature 
was about 10° C higher than tliat of the ordinary Daphnids. This 
mutation was fatal at the or<linary room temperature; it had im- 
portant survival value for the environment of an incubator; it would 
have had an important evolutionary value had there been a warm 
spring near by into which the strain could have been transplanted. 
This experience, indeed, shows the probable method by which 
aquatic animals have come to inhabit hot springs. It is not by 
gradual change wrought on the germ plasm by the direct action of 
the high temperature of the water, but rather the fine opportunity 
for survival afforded by the high temperature to any chance 
thermal mutant. 

Again, as has long been known, many of the animals that live in 
caves are blind and much speculation has been offered to account for 
this blindness. The old idea was that, through disuse and the parsi- 
mony of nature that would prevent it from continuing to form useless 
organs, the useless organs were no longer formed. On the other hand, 
Eigenmann, through his extensive knowledge of fishes, was able to 
point out that the blind fish of caves belonged to just one family of 
fishes, a family that had mutated in the direction of blindness in 
various parts of the continent. Now, some of these mutations in the 
direction of blindness have survived even where there are no caves, 
but where there are waters running through densely wooded swamps 
and characterized by dark holes where poor sight is no handicap to 
the fish. When a blind mutation arose in that family of fishes living 
in the region of limestone caves of Indiana and Kentucky, that muta- 
tion was no handicap to its possessor. For the possessor had other 
sense organs sufficient to secure its prey. The waters of the cave, 
indeed, removed competition, and in other ways afforded an extra- 
ordinarily favorable environment for this genus of fish. 

Another illustration may be afforded by still another group of ani- 
mals. As you know there are vast numbers of mollusks living in the 



424 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 

sea and in fresh waters; clams, oysters, periwinkles, cuttle fishes, 
squids are familiar marine mollusks. But there is a group of mollusks 
that has a history quite as striking as that of the cave fish. This group 
lives on the land, and sometimes, in very drj'^ situations, even semi- 
deserts. In this situation the mollusks breathe by lungs instead of 
gills. How have the land mollusks, the pulmonates, including the 
snails and slugs, come to live on the land? One explanation that has 
been offered is that some marine ancestors gradually moved into 
streams and higher up into ponds which dry up periodically and 
there became gradually modified to breathe air. The matter is not 
quite so simple. The river mussels live in streams and ponds that 
occasionally go dry; they perish under these circumstances by the 
million; and yet they have never become adapted to land life — the 
appropriate mutations have never been afforder. Our land snails are 
the end result of a long series of mutations that have permitted life 

on the land. The first mutations in this 
direction occurred in certain marine snails 
with a gill chamber whose opening is so 
small that it can readily be closed to pre- 
vent the ingress or egress of water. Any 
mutation in this direction would enable its 
possessor to enter into the between-tides 
zone. 

Actualh', there live on our shores shore- 
snails, belonging to the family of Lit- 
torinidae, inhabiting a level where they 
are exposed to air for 12 to 20 hours of 
the day. Indeed, among the Littorinas 

FiGUKE 3. — Lrttorina Utorcn n i • ^ i • «• 

one finds species that diner greatly in 
their emancipation from the sea. During the recession of the tides 
the Littorina keeps the opening to its mantel chamber closed ; so its 
gills are held in a medium saturated air. (Fig. 3.) 

Now, it is out of this general group to which the Littorinas belong 
that the land snails have arisen. Any continued mutation in the 
direction of gill reduction or enclosure of the mantle cavit}^ would 
have been in the direction that would have permitted the possessor 
to pass to dryer parts of the shore line and, incidentally, to escape 
from its enemies. The point is that not just any group of marine 
snails was able to adjust itself to land life, but onl}^ a group in which 
favorable mutations arose. The land crabs and the lung fishes rep- 
resent the end stages of a similar evolutionary history to that of the 
land snails. 

While it appears from these considerations probable that adjust- 
ment to extreme conditions of life has been rendered possible by 




ORGANIC EVOLUTION DAVENPORT 425 

favorable mutations, it still roinaiiis to consider Avhat light modern 
^enetical studies throw upon the details of this process. 

"We have seen that roprodnotion is unlimited and that mutation 
is constantly occurring; not, to bo sure, in infinite amount in all 
directions equally but abundantly in certain penes; more rarely in 
others. AVe have now to consider in turn what induces mutations; 
what fjives direction to nnilations; how are the a<laptations in natui-e 
broujrht about? 

First, the causes of mutation are clearly determined, in part, by 
(he unstable nature of (he «zi>ne itself. The genes are very complex 
molecules, or rather groups of molecules. Now, many complex 
molecules are known in chemistry that are so labile (hat they break 
down almost spontaneously. How many compounds have to be 
kept in the dark, at a low temperature, undisturbed in order that 
they may "keep" at all. In time they "spoil," even under the best 
of conditions. The rate of cliange may be accelerated by heat, light, 
and irradiation. The genes are not exceptions to the rule of change 
in labile substances. "While the nature of the process of mutation 
in tlie genes has shown itself little influenced by external agents the 
velocity of spontaneous change is readily altered. Thus MuUer, 
Hanson, and others find the speed of mutation accelerated by in- 
crease of temperature, and by X rays. No new mutations have been 
brought forth by the X rays, but mutation occurs more rapidly. The 
X rays do not direct evolution, or even mutation, qualitatively, but 
afford opportunity for more rapid evolution by providing, in larger 
amount, one of the factors — mutation — necessary to evolution. 

The fact that X rays may accelerate the process of gene mutation 
has led some to the conclusion that all mutation is due to radiations. 
No doubt conditions compatible with the life of the soma may be 
found that will not permit of mutation, but it does not seem ]irob- 
able that this will ever be the case. Just the conditions essential 
to life probably provide the conditions for gene mutation. 

Second, what gives direction to mutations? It is obvious that the 
organic world is far from being the infinitely diverse collection of 
haphazard and meaningless variants that we might expect were 
mutation entirely uncontrolled. It seems probable that, under ordi- 
nary conditions, genes break down or disintegrate in orderly fashion 
dependent on the nature of the gene. An illustration, which may be 
more than a mere illustration, is afforded in the rare earths where 
uranium breaks down into radium and radium into lead. Each 
stage, in turn, is determined by the immediately preceding stage. 

So, in organisms, the mutations are usually of a recessive nature, 
which seems generally to imply that they are produced bj^ a loss of 
something from the parental gene. In the different species of one 



426 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

genus the same kind of mutations occur. Thus between DrosophUa 
melanog aster ^ D. simulans, and D. virilis quite parallel mutations 
occur and are identified in many cases with genes occupying com- 
parable loci in the chromosomes. Among mammals, with which we 
are naturally best acquainted, certain mutations occur again and 
again. Thus albinism, coat-color pattern, hairlessness, elongated 
hair, reversed hair, taillessness, abnormal hands and feet, particu- 
larly digits, horns or hornlessness, achondroplasia. The recurrence 
of these mutations in various species of mammals, as tabulated by 
Osborn (1912), indicates that mutations are far from haphazard 
in origin, but probably depend upon the same genes with the same 
structure and capacity for change. 

Finally, the mutations with which we are familiar constitute only 
a fraction of those that occur. Every student of intrauterine stages 
of mammalian development is familiar with the phenomenon of in- 
trauterine deaths. So far as our observations go, it appears that in 
mammals more young die in utero than are born. Every student of 
development of sea urchins and other marine organisms knows that 
a large proportion of those that start to develop do not proceed far. 
We see that early developmental stages are those in which great 
selection takes place; probably because the embryos carry non- 
viable mutations. From this point of view the individuals that 
reach maturity constitute the fraction that have undergone no 
lethal mutation. 

The fact of lethal mutations (for they have been demonstrated in 
many cases) helps us to understand the other fact that in the midst 
of the world of mutations the organisms that come through are more 
or less well fitted to survive; they are not always the best, but they 
are good enough to pass the censorship of environment. 

And this brings us to a consideration of the phenomenon which 
Darwin stressed, namely, of adaptation to environment. We have 
already seen that such adaptation is partly brought about through the 
selection by the organism of an environment that is adapted to it. 
We may now consider the case of selection by the environment of 
organisms that are adapted to it. In general, the organism must be 
able to play properly its part in the flow, in and out, of the chemical 
agents, water and foodstuffs, upon which its life and activity de- 
pend. It must be capable of meeting emergencies of climate and 
organic enemies. It must pass the censor at every stage or be 
squelched. 

A little experience of my own, which I published some years 
ago, will serve to show how strict is this censor. I reared a large 
number of chickens to the 1-pound stage and had about 300 running 
over a grassy plot on about the tenth of May, at a time when crows 
are feeding their nestlings and hunting especially meat for them. 



ORGANIC EVOLUTION — DAVENPORT 427 

About 40 per cent of the birds had a white pluma«;e, 40 per cent a 
black (or nearly bhick) plumage, and 20 per cent a phnna<;c in pen- 
ciled or striped markinixs, more or less like that of the ordinary 
game or the jungle fuAvl. Of these the crows killed 24. Expecta- 
tion, on the basis of random attack on the birds, was that about 9.G 
would bo white, 9.G black, and 5 penciled. Actually there were 
killed 10 white, 13 black or prevailingly so, and 1 coarsely mottled 
gray and buff. No truly penciled bird was killed. This observation 
tends to illustrate the principle that the self-colors in wild birds 
tenil to be eliminated because conspicuous to their enemies; birds 
with mixed pattern are relatively imnnme from attack because rela- 
tively inconspicuous. 

Now, though it has not been experimentally proven, yet the hy- 
pothesis may be entertained, that the presence of light-colored mice 
in limestone regions and of dark-colored mice on lava beds may result 
from an elimination of mutations that are in disharmony w^ith the 
background. To nocturnal predaceous animals, like the owls which 
catch mice, a white or light-yellow mouse on a black lava bed would 
be seen and captured before a black one. 

One further fact must be taken into account in considering the ad- 
justment of organisms to their environment, and that is that change 
of environment may well cause and apparently has in the past often 
caused the elimination of species over the whole extent of their area 
of destruction. 

Consider how widespread must have been the consequences on the 
fauna of the Northern Hemisphere as far south as Long Island and 
even further south of the great ice sheets that covered the circum- 
polar territory in glacial epochs. Many poorly clad species of mam- 
mals must have found the icy conditions insupportable; just as the 
mastodon and mammoth did. The change in environment may be 
of a more subtle sort. Thus the great size and herd instincts of the 
bison enabled it to develop enormously on the extensive plains of 
North America and rendered it more than a match for the Amerinds 
living in a stone age. Just this size and number wholly unfitted 
these mammals for the new environment of the aggressive agricul- 
turally inclined white man armed with a rifle. Agriculture and free- 
ranging bisons could not coexist, and the rifle eliminated the 
mammals. So to-day the great size and aggressiveness of the large 
mammals of Africa are a challenge to the sportsman, and the future 
seems to spell extinction for them. Here we have to do with elimin- 
ation resulting from what may be called a cultural evolutionary 
" mutation " — the rifle. 

But man's part in evolution is not merely in the elimination of his 
large enemies, which he has all too thoroughly mastered, but in his 
struggle witli the small and innumerable insects that threaten his 



428 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

agriculture as it becomes more intense. The more successful and pro- 
lific an insect injurious to agriculture is the more certainly will it 
arouse man's destructive energies and the greater the certainty that 
the all too favorable mutation that is the cause of its success will be 
the cause of its elimination in whole, or part. 

But mutations of a still more dangerous sort are threatening man- 
kind, mutations in the world of organisms that live as parasites on 
the human protoplasm. With the more conspicuous of these para- 
sites, external and internal, man has learned to cope. One by one the 
pathogenic bacterial diseases are being eliminated or reduced in fre- 
quency. But now we face still smaller parasitic particles, the filtra- 
bie viruses which are, at present, practically inaccessible to man. 
There seems to be reason to conclude that they are mutating also, 
and perhaps rapidly. The waves of influenza epidemics that pass 
round the world in periodic fashion assume slightly different aspects, 
show somewhat different symptoms, in successive visits. Those who 
are resistant to the one visitation may show slight resistance to the 
next. The selections of the past have left the stocks of the more 
crowded continental areas a hardy resistant people, far more so than 
the peoples of distant oceanic islands that had not undergone selec- 
tion for resistance to the ultra microscopic parasites. When one con- 
templates the high mortality of the influenza epidemic of 1918 one 
realizes that notwithstanding this high resistance it is quite within 
the range of possibility that at some future time a mutation shall 
arise in these viruses such that no human protoplasm is protected 
against it or can protect itself against it. Then our boasted sky- 
scrapers might become inhabited by bats and the safe deposit vaults 
of our cities become the caves of wild animals. 

Whether or not this will occur in the future, the possibility brings 
home a realization of the fact that man is not merely looking on the 
process of evolution taking place around him but, as an organism, 
he is a part of that evolution ; he is acting upon other organisms and 
being acted upon by them as well as by the inorganic world in which 
he lives. He is attempting a mastery of that world; and, indeed, 
upon such mastery his fate may depend. His ability to master that 
world depends upon his superior gifts of intelligence to see relations 
and to idealize new ones. How much farther man can go in this 
direction depends upon the capacity for development of the intelli- 
gence. There are those who warn us that we are approaching the 
limit and must sometime in the future wait for further human evolu- 
tion to make further fundamental progress. To wait until nature 
affords the desired mutation may mean indefinite postponement. Can 
not man himself control his evolution ? Two methods are open ; one 
the production of new and better combinations of traits by appropri- 
ate matings. This is the method of the applied geneticist interested 



ORGANIC EVOLUTIOX — 1>.\\T!NP0RT 429 

in cieatinf^ new and improviMl variotios. This is the method that is 
open to man also, if only some chan«j:e in the social order may make 
it feasible to apply our knowled*re to the improvement of the ireneti- 
cal combinations in mankind. 

But still another way may be (tpened in tlii> future; (hat is the 
aeceleration of mutation by irradiation. The method is frnutrht with 
tremendous ditlioulties. The commonest effect of irradiation of the 
<:onads is the production of defective, often happily nonviable, indi- 
viduals. AVhether the production of scores of defective strains to 
secure one line with a superior mutation is justified will have to be 
considered. But if man is to evolve he must not decline to use nature's 
tools of mutation, cross-matinrr, selective elimination while he seeks 
to become fitted to meet the requirements of an ever chanjiinfr and 
ever more-demandinfj environment. 

To sum up, then; the mechanism of organic evolution, as I see it, 
consists of the following processes: 

1. Infinite capacity of the germinal material for reproduction. 

2. Infinite capacity for mutation. 

3. A finitude - of kinds of environments. 

4. Extensive opportunities for dissemination of the mutant indi- 
viduals over earth, permitting some of them to find an environment 
for which the}' are especially fitted. 

5. As for the rest of the infinitude of individuals, nonmutant and 
mutant (beyond the number required for replacement) — elimination. 

In a .sentence, nature's mechanism of evolution includes the ele- 
ments of: A finitude of kinds of environment, infinite reproduction, 
infinite mutation, infinite opportunity for new mutants to find appro- 
priate environments, and elimination of all of the infinitude of other 
individuals that are not required for replacement. 

Tlomo sapirns is only a natural species with a highly evolved hand 
and brain. This species has reached its lofty position in evolution 
by the proce.sses described. It is proud of its control of nature in 
certain directions. Let it beware lest it think it can evolve further 
by a man-made formula that may suit its perverted desires but must 
eventually fail of permanent progress if opposed to the formula of 
nature.

[With 13 plates] 



Variations in plants and animals are the building stones out of 
which the present wide range of agricultural and horticultural forms 
have been developed. Experimental study of the origin of these 
variations has been concerned cliiefly with changes in the ultimate 
hereditary unit factoi-s. The present paper, however, discusses 
variations wliich are brought about by changes in relatively large 
groups of factors contained in chromosomes. In this summary of 
the types that have been discovered in the Jimson weed {Datura 
stramonium), text and illustrations from earlier publications^ have 
been freely drawn upon, but much is presented here for the first time. 

What chromosomes are may be better understood from Figure 1, 
which is a diagram intended to represent a plant of tlie Jimson 
weed {Datura stramonium) with a single enlarged flower. It need 
hardly be pointed out to most readers that all parts of the plant — 
root, stem, leaves, and flowers — are made up of microscope units, 
called cells, roughly analogous to the building bricks of an archi- 
tectural structure, and that in each cell there is a definite number 
of still smaller rod-shaped bodies called chromosomes. The name 
chromosome means merely " colored body," and was given to these 
protoplasmic rods because they became strongly colored when acted 
upon by certain dyes. At the right of the diagram in Figure 1 are 
shown three cells with chromosomes and in Plate 5 are shown 
chromosomes as they actually appear under the microscope. The 
student of heredity is interested in chromosomes because they are 
the bearers of the ultimate hereditary factors wliich are transmitted 
from parent to offspring. 

The diagram might have been improved if, instead of rods, we 
had used narrow medifine vials and had filled each vial with a row

of different kinds of pills. The pills with different potencies might 
represent the ultimate hereditary factors, and the vials which held 
them miglit represent the chromosomes. The comparison is far from 
perfect, but at any rate the chromosomes are believed to contain each 
a single row of unit factors arranged like beads on a string. Although 
these factors are ultramicroscopic in size, their relative position in the 
chromosome may be determined indirectly by a number of methods. 
Throughout the vegetative parts of the plant, there are two of 
each kind of chromosomes as shown diagrammatically at the right 




Figure 1. — Diagrum of reproductive cycle in the Jiruson weed. There are 12 kinds 
of chromosomes which are rod-shaped bodies carrying the hereditai-y factors. In 
cells of the vegetative (2n) part of the plant, each chromosome is present twice. 
In the male (cT) and female (?) sex cells (In), found in the pollen grains and 
ovules, each chromosome is present only once 

of the bracket. Since there are two chromosomes in each of the 12 
sets, this part of the plant is called the 2n or diploid stage. At 
every division of a cell in the 2n stage, each chromosome divides 
longitudinally into two bodies like itself, until the divisions preced- 
ing the formation of the sex cells. 

Just before the production of the egg cells within the ovary and 
the pollen grains within the stamens, the chromosomes fail to 
undergo the usual process of division and one entire chromosome 
from each pair goes to each of the two daughter cells, thus reducing 
the number of chromosomes by one-half. In this " reduced," hap- 



EXTRA CHROMOSOMES — BL.\KESLEE 433 

IoIlI, or 111 stage tliere is only a single chromosome in each set, as 
shown in the diagram. According to the conventional use, a circle 
represents the female sex cell and a s<iuare the male sex cell. After 
pollination, when the pollen tubes have grown down to the ovary and 
have let out the male sex cells, fertilization takes place by the union 
of the latter with the egg cells. The result of fertilization is a seed 
in which the number of chromosomes is doubled. We come again, 
therefore, to the 2n or diploid stage. 

All the higher })lants and animals show this distinction between 
u lin stage, in which there are two chromosomes in each set; and 
a In stage, including the sex cells, in which there is only one chromo- 
some in each set. The number of sets, however, varies widely among 
the dirt'erent species, although constant for any given form. Thus 
in the fruit fly there are 4 chromosomal sets, in man 24 sets, in the 
jiightshade 36 sets, and in the Jimson weed 12 sets. In many spe- 
cies there is no visible dillerence between the individual chromo- 
somes, although the breeding evidence may prove that they carry 
ditferent factors. In the Jimson weed, however, size classes can 
be distinguished, as shown diagianuuatically in the figures. Some 
of the chromosomes are further distinguished by presence of humps. 
It should be pointed out that, although the diagrams show roughly 
the relative sizes of the cliromosomes, the arrangement is purely 
diagrammatic. The point to be emphasized is the grouping of the 
chromosomes into 12 separate sets although their association into 
such sets can be seen only in the cells immediately preceding 
the reduction division. 

ABNORMAL ARRANGEMENT OF CHROMOSOMES 

While no change in the number of 12 chromosomal sets is known 
to have taken place in the Jimson weed, a considerable variation in 
the number of chromosomes within the sets may occur. Some of the 
chromosomal types that have been identified are shown diagram- 
matically in Figure 2. Since these diagrams represent the condition 
in the adult plant, only the diploid (2n) condition is normal. The 
plants are classified into balanced and unbalanced types according 
to whether or not all the sets have the same number of chromosomes. 

BALANCED CHROMOSOMAL TYPES 

Balanced types may be still further divided into even-balaiu cd or 
rrtable. and odd-balanced or unstable types. The former have an 
even number of chromosomes in each set. form sex cells with half the 
/lumber of chromosomes, and hence breed essentially true. The 
latter have an odd number in a set, and are, therefore, unable to 
form sex cells with an equal division of chromosomes, and hence can 
not breed true. 



434 ANNUAL BEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 

Mature plants of In, 2n, and 4n types are shown in Plates 1, 2, 
and 3. 

Flowers, floral parts, and capsules of the balanced types are shown 
in Plate 4. An increase in size of cells and organs of the plant is 
the rule in going from In to 4n forms, as is seen in the flowers in 
the photograph. In comparison with normals (2n), the leaves of In 
plants are very narrow while those of 4n plants are very broad. The

4n capsule is broader and more nearly spherical than the 2n capsule. 
It will be noted that the odd-balanced In and 3n capsules are much 
reduced in size, probably because of the small number of seeds which 
they contain. 

Because In and 3n plants produce such a scanty yield of capsules 
and seeds, they continue blossoming long after the normal (2n) and 



EXTRA CHROMOSOMES — BLAKESLEE 435 

the 4ri plants have become ?ct up with capsules and ceased flowering. 
The In and 3n types, therefore, are of floricultural vahie in species 
in which it is possible to have a continuation of flowering by re- 
ducing seed production. Since such unstable balanced types can not 
breed true it would be necessary to propagate them by vegetative 
methods such as by grafts, cuttings, bulbs, etc. 

Tetraploids (4n) arc of horticultural value from the large size of 
(licir flowers. To the plant breeder they are of value as the means 
of obtaining triploids (3n). The cross 4n x 2n produces 3n or tri- 
ploid individuals. From the latter may be obtained a wide range 
of types with extra chromosomes as will ha shown later. 

UNBALANCED CHROMOSOMAL TYPES 

In the unbalanced chromosomal types not all the chromosomal 
sets have tlie same number of chromosomes. Some of the types are 
shown in the diagrams in Figure 2. The simplest type is a modified 
diploid or 2n plant with an extra chromosome in one of the 12 sets. 
For comparison, diagrams of the chromosomes of a normal 2n plant 
from our standard line 1 are shown in Figure 3. All except two are 
in outline only. We will center our discussion upon these two 
chromosomes. The largest (L) for convenience may be called the 
white chromosome, and the small, medium one without the hump 
(w), which is stippled in the diagram, will be called the stippled 
chromosome. One half of each of these chromosomes has been 
shaded to distinguish it from the other half. The outer ends of each 
half are marked by a black dot. Models of the same chromosomes 
are shown in Plate 5. 

The ends of all the chromosomes in the Jimson weed have also 
been designated by numbers 1 to 24. Thus the white chromosome, 
which is the largest of the 12, is numbered 1 • 2. Similarly the 
stippled chromosome is represented by the numbers 17 • 18. In all 
cases the odd number corresponds to the shaded half of the models. 

riilMARY, SECONDARY, AND TERTIARY (2N+1) TYPES 

If to the set of two white chromosomes, an extra member (1-2) 
like the other two is added as shown by the models (pi. 5 -^1), we have 
a (2n4-l) type of distinct appearance represented by our " Rolled " 
mutant. From the peculiarities of this type we may learn some- 
thing about the aggregate of factors contained in the white chro- 
mosomes. A type, named " Sugarloaf," is known in which the 
chromosome added to the white set consists of two unshaded halves 
(2 ■ 2) joined together as shown in Plate 5 B. The characters of the 
mutant type which results tell us something about the factors in the 
unshaded (or 2-2) half of the white chromosome. A type, named 
" Polycarpic," complementary to that just discussed, has the extra 



436 



ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 



chromosome made up of two shaded halves (1-1) (pi. 5 6'). This 
type gives us information regarding the factors in the shaded (or 
1-1) half of the white chromosome. 

A type with the extra chromosome like the other two in the set is 
called a primm'y type in distinction from secondary types, in which

the extra chromosomes have been formed apparently by a breaking 
into two of a normal chromosome and a joining together of like 
halves. In the models we have not shown how the chromosomes in 
the trisome, or set of three, are attached together in the reduction 
divisions. Plate 5 A, B, C shows the appearance under the micro- 
scope of the chromosomes of the primary and the two secondaries of

the white set. Those of Rolled and Su<rnrloaf are taken from Bell- 
ini's fifjures, tliose of Polycarpic w^ere drawn by Doctor Berp^ner. 
Since only like ends may become attached, the trisome of secondaries 
may form a closed rinp: of three, but the chromosomes of a primary 
never can form such a closed conli^uration. 

Plate G A, li, and (' shows mature plants, capsules, and seedlings, 
of the three (2n+l) types under discussion. 

If we compare the primary Rolled with its two complementary 
secondaries, Sugarloaf and Polycarpic — all three the result of single 
extra chromosomes in the white set — we will note that each secondary 
is extreme in certain characters while the primary i.s intermediate. 
Thus, in Sugarloaf the capsule is large, a peculiarity due to the un- 
balance brought about by two extra unshaded halves of the white 
chromosome. In Polycarpic, the other secondary, the capsule is 
small, a fact resulting from the presence of two extra shaded halves. 
The primary Rolled, having extra both the shaded and the unshaded 
half of this same white chromosome, is intermediate in capsule size 
and shape. 

Similarly from the habit photographs (pi. 6) it will be seen that 
the secondary Polycarpic is erect and has very narrow leaves. The 
complementary secondary Sugarloaf is spreading and has broader 
leaves. The primary Rolled is intermediate in respect to both these 
characters. 

In a similar manner in the stippled set, we have a primary type 
called " Poinsettia " (pi. 7, fig. 1) due to an extra stippled (17- 18) 
chromosome and a secondary type called " Dwarf " (pi. 7, fig. 2) due 
to the presence of an extra made up of two shaded halves (17 • 17) of 
(he stippled chromosomes. The secondary with an extra made up of 
two unshaded halvas of the stippled chromosome (18 18) has 
not yet been discovered. Possibly it is not viable. From the char- 
acters of the primary wc know something of the factors in the whole 
stipi)led chromosome and from the characters of the single second- 
ary (17- 17), we know" something of the factors in the shaded half. 
By subtraction we can gain some idea of what characters the miss- 
ing secondary should show when discovered and hence of what the 
factors are in the unshaded (18) half of the stippled chromosome. 

Photographs of the capsules of the 12 primary (2n + l) types in 
the Jimson weecl are given in Plate 8 below that of a normal (2n) 
capsule. It will be noted that all are different. Capsules of the 
secondaries are distinct from those of their jirimaries as well as from 
ihose of other secondaries. Extra chromosomes have similar effects 
upon other parts of the plant. E.xtra chromosomal material thus 
bi-iiigs about distinct and sj>ecific changes in the appearance of the 
plant in which it is present. This it does because of the genetic 
2.8005—31 29 



438 ANNUAL EEPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

factors which the extra material contains. It will be noted from our 
previous illustration (pis, 5 and 6) that there must be a different 
set of factors in the two halves of the 1 • 2 chromosome since the 
secondary Sugarloaf , which has the 2 • 2 chromosome extra, does not 
resemble the secondary Polycarpic, which has the 1 • 1 chromosome 
extra. In no chromosome does there appear to be a greater similar- 
ity between the groups of factors in the two halves than between the 
groups of factors in two different normal chromosomes. 

The unbalance which extra chromosomes exert over the normal 
balanced condition may best be shown by capsules of the " Globe " 
mutants. The Globe chromosome is next to the smallest of the 12, 
but the changes which it brings about when present in excess are 
very distinct. As shown in Plate 9, we have two diploid (2n) 
Globes, or, more properly speaking, two diploids modified by extra 
chromosomes in the Globe set. The (2n+l) Globe has one extra 
chromosome in the Globe set giving an unbalance of one over the 
normal complement of 24. The (2n + 2) Globe, with two extra 
chromosomes in the same set, has a greater unbalance (2 over 24) 
and in consequence all Globe characters, such as depression of the 
capsule, are heightened in expression. In similar manner starting 
with the capsule of a tetraploid at the right, it will be seen that the 
tetraploid Globes have their capsules relatively more depressed and 
their spines relatively stouter as we pass from (4n+l ) to (4n+2) 
and (4n + 3) Globes. A (4n + 4) Globe has not yet appeared in our 
cultures, but we might expect it, since the unbalance which its extra 
chromosomes exert would be 4 over 48 which is the same un- 
balance found in the (2n + 2) Globe (2 over 24). Similarly we 
might expect a haploid (ln + 1) Globe with an unbalance of 1 over 
12, but this unbalance, found as yet only in the rare (2n+2) Globes, 
may be the limit of unbalance which a plant can endure, and may 
be possible only in the diploid series. In the center of the picture 
we have a (3n + l) Globe obtained by crossing a (4n + l) Globe with 
a 2n pollen parent. 

We have discussed primary or unmodified chromosomes and sec- 
ondary chromosomes in which the two ends are alike. A (2n+l) 
type appeared not infrequently in our cultures which was neither a 
primary nor a secondary type. It always came from hybrids between 
our standard line 1 and certain " B " races. From the attachment 
of the extra chromosome to both the white (1-2) and the stippled 
(17-18) chromosomes, Belling concluded that the extra chromosome 
consisted of part of the white and part of the stippled chromosome. 
From these findings he proposed the hypothesis of interchange be- 
tween segments of these nonhomologous chromosomes to account 
for the origin of " B " races from the standard type. The chromo-

somal diagram of such " B " races is shown in.Fif^ure 4. It will be 
noted t)iat all except the white and the stippled chromosomes are the 
same as those in our standard line 1 (Fig. 3). There is no necessary 
difference between the two races, in respect to the factors which these

race, it would form a primary (2n + l) type of this race. It is con- 
venient, however, to use our line 1 as a standard and to classify types 



440 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

in reference to this single highly inbred line. The two interchanged 
chromosomes, when added to line 1 diploids (2n), produce (2n+l) 
tertiary forms. " Wiry " (pi. 10, fig. 2) is a tertiary with the 1 • 18 
chromosome extra and " Dwarf Sugarloaf " (pi. 10, iig. 1) is a ter- 
tiary with the 17 • 2 chromosome extra. 

Three other types of races have been found in nature in which 
two chromosomes differ from those in line 1 by interchange of seg- 
ments. Each of these races should give two tertiary (2n+l) types 
when properly combined with our standard line 1. 

In Table 1 (p. 449) are summarized the (2n + l) types thus 
far identified, together with the factors (genes) already located in 
particular chromosomes. The chromosomes are recognized microsco- 
pically first by size and designated by the initials of tlie adjectives 
Large (very), large. Medium ( + ), medium (-), Small and small 
(very). Special modifications (humps) serve secondarily to fur- 
ther distinguish chromosomes of the same size. 

In mutations called primary (col. 3) an extra chromosome is 
added to 1 of the 12 ; this is like the other two of the group of three 
(trisome) thus made. Its two ends are designated by numbers. 
In mutations called secondary the extra chromosome is made up by 
the doubling of only one-half, or terminal portion, of a chromosome. 
In column 2, this half chromosome is indicated by the odd number 
of the numbered ends of the primary chromosomes. Complementary 
to this is the extra chromosome made up of the two even-numbered 
ends. (Col. 4.) 

In mutations called tertiary the extra chromosome is made up of 
united end portions from two nonhomologous chromosomes. These 
are listed in column 5 ; each one twice. 

Secondaries have been discovered for all except the smallest two 
chromosomes. For four chromosomes, both the primary and its 
two complementary secondaries are known. (Cols. 2 and 4). The 
tertiary chromosomes DS, Wy, and SE have been isolated from chro- 
mosomal races found in nature, such as the " B " race discussed in 
an earlier paragraph. They originated presumably through seg- 
mental interchange, as also probably the tertiary chromosomes Mp, 
ES, and X which were formed in cultures of our standard line 1. 
The other named tertiaries have been induced by radiation treatment. 
Of the tertiary chromosomes represented by figures in parentheses, 
the ends are known, but their effects upon the plant, when present as 
extras, have not been adequately studied. After a little practice the 
primary, secondary, and tertiary (2n+l) types are easily recognized 
without microscopic examination by the effects upon various parts 
of the plant brought about by the presence of the extra chromosomes 
or new combinations of fragments of chromosomes.

DOUBLE (211 + 1 + 1) TYl'ES 

III luklitioii to tyi)os with a sin«;le chroiiiosuiue oxlra, tomhiiui- 
tions of these types in double (2n+l+l) forms are known. The 
simplest double type is a combination of two primaries. In Plate 

11 is shown a capsule of the double type " Ilex-Globe " to«;ether with 
capsules of the (*in + l) types " Ilex " and " Globe ", and of a normal 
(2n) for comparison. The adjoininj^ diagrams show the chromo- 
somes. In Ilex the smallest chromosome is extra. Among other 
eifects, it reduces the size of the capsule and causes the si)inos to be 
slender. In Globe, the next to the smallest chromosome is extra. 
The extia Globe chromosome is res[)oiisible for a depressed capsule. 
In Ilex-Globe, in which both the Ilex and the Globe chromosomes 
are extra, the capsule has the globose shape due to the Globe chromo- 
some and the fine spines and small size due to the Ilex chromosome. 
The characters of the cap^ide ami other parts of the plant in d(Mible 
mutant types are the resultant of the interacting factors in the two 
extra chromosomes. 

Double (2n+l + l) types are occasionally found occurring spon- 
taneously. They are found in large numbers in the offspring of 
triploids (3n) along with the 12 primaries and normals (2n). Plate 

12 shows capsules from primary and double chromosomal types 
which appeared among 1,152 olispring of triploids (3u) grown in 
1925. The double types which were recognized at that time by other 
characters but which had no capsules suitable for the photograph 
are indicated by a +. Other double types which have been found 
in later cultures are indicated b}' a ( + ) in parentheses. The lower 
horizontal row contains capsules of 11 of the 12 primary (2n + l) 
types. The twelfth (Sp) is less common than the rest and was 
omitted from the photograph. Each double type nniy be consid- 
ered a combination between two primary (2n+l) types, since it has 
two extra chromosomes in different sets corresponding to the extra 
chromosomes in the two respective primaries listed at the ends of 
the intersecting columns. 

COMPENSATING TYPES 

In compensating types there may In; only a single extra chromo- 
some, so far as the counts show, but two modified chromosomes are 
actually present. The condition may be illustrated by the compen- 
sating type "Nubbin "' (Nb). A capsule of Nb, together with cap- 
sules of the types which it throws in its offspring, is shown in Plate 
13, Figure 1. Bk, Kl, and I2c are primary (2n + l) tyi)es and need 
not concern us here. Ph and Ilg are tertiary (2n + l) types which 
have as their extra chromosomes the modified chromosomes present in 
Nb. The nuitter will be made clearer by the diagrams of the chromo- 
somes of Nb shown in Figure 5. The Kollcd (Kl) chromosome (1 • 2)

ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 



is our old friend the white chromosome. The chromosome 5 • 6 is 
" Buckling " (Bk) and 9 • 10 is " Echinus " (Ec). The chromosomes 
5 • G and 9 • 10 are in pairs but there is only one normal 1 ■ 2 chromo- 
some present. However, the "Pinched" (Ph) chromosome (5-2) 
furnishes the 2 half and the "Hedge" (Hg) chromosome (1-9) 
furnishes the 1 half of the missing 1 • 2 chromosome. The portions 
1 and 2 in these two chromosomes are said to compensate to give the 
equivalent of a normal 1 • 2 chromosome. There is left over as extra 

chromosomal material, therefore, the 5 
half and the 9 half chromosomes. 
The 5 • 2 and 1 • 9 chromosomes are ter- 
tiary chromosomes which, as extras in the 
types Ph and Hg, are thrown by the 
compensating type Nb. (PL 13, fig. 1.) 
The related chromosomes involved in 
Nb may be given by the following for- 
mula :

half of the missing 1 • 2 chro- 
mosome. The 5 and 9

The dashes indicate the connections of 
the chromosomes at the reduction divi- 
sions. The chromosomes of Nb, as of 
other compensating types with two ter- 
tiary chromosomes, form a chain of seven 
attached members. In this as in the fol- 
lowing cases the parts which compensate 
are shown in italics and the parts which 
remain as extra chromosomal material 
are shown in boldface type. 

MD is another compensating type 
with the same chromosome (1-2) compensated. Its formula is: 

9-10— 10-9— 9-./— 1-2— ;g-17—17-18— 18-17. 

MD shows some resemblance to Nb because of the 9 half chromosome 
which is in excess in both types. Its appearance, however, is affected 
more strongly by the excess 17 half and in consequence its resem- 
blance to Nb is not great. 

The formula of another compensating type which is not yet named 
is: 

13 • 14— 14 • 13—13 -11— II ■ 12—12 • 17—17 • 18—18 -17. 

In this case the 11-12 chromosome is compensated and the extra 
chromosomal material is 13 and 17. This type shows some resem- 
blance to MD on account of the 17 half chromosome which is extra 
in both types. Because the remaining extra chromosomal material 
is not the same in the two types the two forms are not alike in ap- 
pearance. 



EXTRA CHROMOSOMES — BLAKESLEE 443 

The three examj^les tlmt have been jjiven involve compensation 
l)etween two tertiary (.hroniosonies. A tertiary and a secondary 
chromosome may also compensate. An example is the compensating 
type involvini? the vrhite and the stippled chromosomes. Models of 
the type are shown in Plate 13, Figure 2. Its formula is: 

1777— 17-18— /.S-l— 1-2— 2 1. 

Compensating types involving a secondary and a tertiary chromo- 
some form a chain of five attached chromosomes at reduction 
division. 

Another compensating type, similar to the one just given but of 
different appearance, has the following formula: 

3-5— 3-4— 4-22— 22-21— 21-22. 

In addition to compensations between two tertiary chromosomes 
and between a secondary and a tertiary chromosome, it should be 
possible to obtain compensations between a fragment and a tertiary, 
and between a fragment and a secondary chromosome. Such types 
have not yet been obtained but crosses have been made from which 
it will probably be possible to secure them. 

"With the examples given in mind, it w^ill be possible to define a 
compensating type as one in which parts of two different composite 
chromosomes compensate to form the equivalent in chromosomal 
material of a whole normal chromosome, leaving the remaining non- 
compensating parts of the two composite chromosomes to bring about 
changes in structure in the plant affected. 

ORIGIN OF CHROMOSOMAL TYPES 

Of the balanced types, tlie In or haploid comes from the develop- 
ment of an unfertilized egg cell and hence has the same reduced num- 
ber of chromosomes as the sex cells. Ilaploids have arisen spontan 
feously over a hundred times in our cultures of the Jimson Weed, bui. 
what external stimulus if any is responsible for their occurrence is 
not known. Haploids have been found in several other species. 

Tetraploids (4n) have been relatively abundant in Datura. They 
frequently appear first as a 4n branch on an otherwise 2n plant. 
This fact and other evidence leads to the belief that the doubling of 
chromosomes takes place after fertilization has occurred. High 
temperature at time of seed germination seems to stimulate the pro- 
duction of 4n individuals. 

Triploids (3n), as earlier shown, are produced by crossing a 4n 
individual with pollen from a 2n plant. 

Of the (2n-f 1) types, the primaries arise spontaneously from time 
to time in our cultures but can be obtained in great numbers among 
the offspring of 3n parents.

ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 



Secondary (2n + l) types occur spontaneously, but much less fre- 
quently than the primaries. There is no known method oi' obtain- 
ing them in large numbers. 

Tertiary (2n+l) types have been obtained by a number of dif- 
ferent methods, (a) A few have occurred spontaneously in our 
cultures, (b) They have been secured from cryptic chromosomal 
races in nature, such as the "B" races. (Fig. 4.) By crossing 
the " B " race, for example, onto a (2n + l) type in which the extra 
chromosome is related to the modified chromosomes of the " B " race, 
a (2n + l) tertiary may be secured in the next 
generation. By this method we have secured 
the tertiaries Wy (pi. 10, fig. 2) and DS. (pi. 
10, fig. 1). (c) Since it is known that other 
species differ from our standard line 1 in the 
arrangement of the parts of their chromosomes 
more than does the " B " race, these other spe- 
cies probably afford another rich source of ter- 
tiary forms. Some success has already been 
had in seeking tertiary forms from this source. 
(d) The most prolific method of obtaining ter- 
tiary chromosomes, liowever, is treatment with 
radium or X rays. Under this stimulus, non- 
homologous chromosomes are broken and their 
parts interchanged to produce tertiary chromo- 
somes such as were described for the " B " race. 
(Fig. 4.) In hybrids between "B" race and 
our standard line 1 the chromosomes at the 
reduction division are seen to be connected to- 
gether in a circle of four. (Fig. 6.) This con- 
figuration results because like ends of chromo- 
somes are attached together at the reduction 
division. In a similar manner circles of at- 
tached chromosomes result when radiation has induced segmental 
interchange between two nonhomologous chromosomes. Thus fol- 
lowing radiation treatment, the chromosomes 1 • 2 and 13 • 14 inter- 
changed segments to form the tertiary chromosomes 1 • 14 and 2 • 13. 
The following circle resulted :

EXTRA CHROMOSOMES — BI^VKESLEE 445 

By the proper breeding; priK-cilinv tlii'se types, which are hybrid for 
the modified chromosoiues and therefore show circles of four, may 
be i)iirilied so that the new tertiary chn)niosonies are in pairs. Such 
})urilied races witli modified chromosomes are called ptivie types. 
By crossing such prime types onto the })roper (2n + l) forms, it is 
possible to get the modified chromosome as an extra and thus to form 
(2n+l) tertiary forms. At the present time we have 40 different 
j)rime tyi)es and about 90 types with circles or chains which we are 
attempting to j)urify into prime types. 

Translocations have been also induced by radiation. In a speiific 
case the 1'2 chromosome was broken in two and the 12 half was 
translocated and permanently attached to the 11 end of the 11 • I'i 
chromosome making a large compound chromosome 2 "11 'IS. The 
1 portion was left free as a fragment. AVe have gotten rid of the 
1 fragment and obtained plants with one and others with two of 
the 2 • 11 • 12 chromosome. The latter breed true and have given rise 
to a distinct race very ililferent in a[)pearance from normal 2n plants 
from which they arose. 

Compensating types nui^' be obtained in various ways such as by 

crossing a i)rime type onto the appropriate secondary (2n+l) form 

and obtaining the comi)ensating type in the next generation. In the 

otfspi-ing of a plant with a circle of six attached chromosomes, one 

shouhl expect from one to three compensating types according to the 

manner in which the abnormal chromosomes have been modified. 

Thus radiation treatment induced a circle of six witli tlie followiuir 

composition : 

11-12— 12 17— 17 18 

I I 

1113— 1;M4— 14 18 

In the next generation a compensating type was obtained in which 
the 11 • 13 and the 12 • 17 tertiaries compensated for the 11 • 12 normal 
chromosome. 

Circles of six and more chromosomes may be obtained as a source 
of compensating types by crossing two appropriate prime types 
together. Thus we have two prime types (a) and {h). The for- 
mula for {a) is: 1*14, 2-13, 23-24. The formula for (5) is 1-2, 
13-23, 14-24. "When either is crossed with our standard line 1, 
a circle of four results as shown in a preceding i)aragrai)]i. When 
(a) is crossed with {h) the hybrid which results has a circle of six. 
The formula of this circle would be as follows: 

12 — 2 13— 13 23 

I I 

114— 14-24— 24-23 

By crossing prime types together we have obtained circles composed 
of as many as 10 chromosomes. The larger the number of chronio- 



446 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

somes in a circle the greater the opi^ortunity for the occurrence of 
compensating types in the offspring. 

SUMMARY OF CHROMOSOMAL TYPES IN DATURA 

In the preceding section the manner of origin of the most impor- 
tant chromosomal types in the Jimson Weed has been discussed. In 
the present section a summary will be given of the types so far 
identified in this species. 

In Table 2 (p. 450) the main chromosomal types are listed together 
with the number of different forms actually identified and the number 
theoretically possible for each type. The calculations are based on 
the assumption that the two parts into which a chromosome breaks 
are always equal. This assumption is Imown to be contrary to fact 
and in consequence the number of forms theoretically possible is 
much larger than the calculated figures. Formulae are given in the 
last column which enable one to apply the calculations to species 
with different numbers of chromosomes. Primary, secondary, and 
tertiary chromosomes are represented by the Roman numerals I, II, 
and III. It should be pointed out that these three kinds of extra 
chromosomes are defined in terms of our standard line 1. The class 
numbers in the column at the left may be of convenience for refer- 
ence. 

Of the unmodified balanced types, In, 2n, 3n, and 4n forms are 
the only ones so far obtained in Datura. Doubling of the 3n and of 
the 4n types should give 6n and 8n forms but these theoretically 
possible forms have not yet been found in Datura. 

Class 5 are the primary (2n + l) types. Of these types, each with 
an unmodified chromosome extra, there can be only as many as 
there are different kinds of chromosomes. All the 12 possible to 
Datura have been identified. 

Class 6 are the secondary (2n + 2/2) types in which the extra 
chromosome consists of a doubled half chromosome. Since there 
are 24 halves that can be doubled, there are 24 secondary types that 
are theoretically possible. Of these, 14 have been identified and 
kept under cultivation. Two of the primaries (El and Sp) have 
very poor viability but each has a single secondary with good via- 
bility. Since a primary is intermediate in character between its 
two secondaries, it is likely that the missing secondaries of El and 
Sp would have too poor viability to permit them to survive even if 
they were actually formed. Others of the missing secondaries may 
also be nonviable. For convenience in explanation, we have spoken 
of the secondary chromosomes as having been formed by a doubling 
of one-half of a normal chromosome. There is evidence, however, 
that the parts into which a chromosome breaks in the formation of 
a secondary are not always equal. 



EXTRA CHROMOSOMES BL.\KESLEB 447 

Class 7 are the tertiary (2n+l) types formed by segmental inter- 
change between nonhomologous chromosomes. Their ends therefore 
are from different primary chromosomes. Judging from interchanges 
involving three chromosomes, it appears prol)able that more than two 
chromosomes may take part in the ft)rmation of a tertiary chromo- 
some. Moreover, the fact that the interchange in several cases is 
known not to involve exact halves of the two chromosomes involved 
is furtiier evidence that the number of tertiaries theoretically possible 
is much larger than the 2G4 given in the table. A considerable num- 
ber of chromosomes have been identified as tertiaries but tlie mor- 
phological characters of eight (2n+l) tertiary forms have been 
studied in cultivation. 

Class 8 has two extra chromosomes but they are both in the same 
set. The (2n + 2 Gl) shown in Plate 9 is an example. 

Class 9 also has two extra chromosomes in the same set but one 
of these extras is a primary and the other a secondary. 

Class 10 includes the double (2n + l + l) types which have two extra 
primary chromosomes in different sets. Examples have been given 
in Plates 11 and 12. 

Class 11 comprises the double types which have extra chromo- 
somes in different sets, one of the extras being a primary and the 
other an unrelated secondary chromosome. 

Class 12 comprises the double types in which one of the extras is 
a primary and the other a tertiary chromosome. 

Class 13 comprises the rare group in which there are three extra 
chromosomes, each in a different set. One form of this type has 
been surely identified by its chromosomes. It was too feeble in 
growth to give offspring. 

Class 14 comprises types in which one chromosome has been 
dropped out. Such types would be expected only as abnormal 
branches on otherwise normal plants. A number of deficiencies of 
this kind have been found but so far as analyzed they have been 
caused by a dropping out of one of two chromosomes (Rl or Pn). 
Apparently a sex cell (In) can not live unless all the 12 different 
chromosomes are present. Hence, deficiencies would not be expected 
directly from sexual reproduction. 

Class 15 is similar to class 14 in that one branch is a chromosomal 
deficiency. In class 15, however, the plant begins as a secondary 
(2n+2/2) type and the chromosome that is eliminated is a pri- 
mary related to the secondary chromosome. Thus a " Dwarf " type, 
which has a 17 • 17 chromosome in addition to two 17 • 18 chromo- 
somes, lost one of the 17 • 18 chromosomes in forming an abnormal 
branch. 

Class IG includes the compensat ng types in which the compensa- 
tion is between a secondary and i tertiary chromosome; while in 
class 17 the compensation is between the two tertiaries. 



448 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

Class 18 is a compensating type like those in class 17 which, in 
addition to two tertiary chromosomes, contains an extra primary 
chromosome. 

Class 19 includes types with a single fragment of a chromosome 
extra. By inbreeding, types may ..be obtained with two of some 
of these fragments. These are included in class 20. Similarly an 
attached (or translocated) fragment may be present once or twice 
to form the types represented by classes 21 and 22. A considerable 
number of primary and secondary (2n + l) types have been com- 
bined Avith the fragment types of class 19 and with the translo- 
cated type of class 21. These compound types are distinct but have 
not been included in the tabulations. 

The modified diploids (2n) listed in classes 5 to 22 are the most 
distinct of the extra chromosomal types. As pointed out in the 
discussion of the different " Globe " types shown in Plate 9, the addi- 
tion of an extra chromosome to a 3n or to a 4n type brings about 
relatively little change in the appearance of the plant affected. 
However, 4n types may be strongly modified by the addition of a 
larger number of chromosomes than would be possible in the dip- 
loid (2n) series. Furthermore, deficiencies may be transmitted by 
the sex cells of 4n parents since the normal sex cells of 4n plants are 
2n. A (2n— 1) sex cell would be a deficiency but might be viable 
since it would have at least one chromosome of each kind. The most 
extreme modification of a 4n is that given in type 32. In two dif- 
ferent sets. Doctor Belling found an extra chromosome and in 
two other sets he found a single chromosome missing. The 3n and 
4n types modified by deficiencies were determined by study of their 
chromosomes. The plants were obviously abnormal but the ab- 
normalities have not been connected up with the particular chromo- 
somes which were missing. It is difficult to evaluate the unbalance 
due to the addition or loss of single chromosomes in the 3n and 4n 
series. 

By means of extra chromosomes and parts of chromosomes it has 
been found possible to secure a wide range of variations in Datura 
affecting the structure and physiology of all parts of the plant 
that have been studied. In fact, chromosomal variations in this 
species have been much more frequent than apparent changes in 
the ultimate factors or genes, as may be seen by comparing the 
genes listed in Table 1 with the chromosomal types in Tables 1 
and 2. 

It is not believed that Datura is an exception among plants in 
that it is capable of producing visible variations in large numbers 
by means of major changes in amount of chromosomal material. 



EXTRA CHROMOSOMES — BLAKESLEE

Probably any other plant equally well adapted to breeding experi- 
ments would f^ivc similar results when sufficiently investigated. 
Evidence has been accumulating that select horticultural varieties, 
which have been kept true to ty^w by vegetative propagation, are 
frequently characteri/Anl by extra chromosomes. Pending detailed 
analysis of such forms, it is logical to attribute their desirable char- 
acters as much to the extra chromosomes which they possess as to 
any individual factors in res[)ect to which they may differ from 
the average, 

P^xtra chromosomes in unbalanced types are transmitted to only 
part of the offspring. Such types, however, can be multiplied by 
cuttings, grafts, and other vegetative methods of reproduction. By 
such means horticulturists in the past have unwittingly propagated 
chromosomal types which were oidy later recognized as such when 
their chromosomes were studied. It is our belief that in the future 
extra chromosomes will be consciously utilized as a source of de- 
sirable variations in })lants of economic importance.

THE AGE OF THE HUMAN RACE IN THE LIGHT OF 

GEOLOGY^ 



By Stephen Riciiakz, S. V. D. 

St. Mary's CoU<(jc and Scmiiiarj/, Tcthny, 111. 



[With 3 plates] 



There is perhaps no problem upon ^Yluch we find more divergence 
of opinion than upon this one of the age of the human race. Between 
those who still adhere to an age of 0,000 or 8,000 years, as was assumed 
by the older Biblical exegesis, and those who are exceedingly liberal 
even with millions, we find all possible shades of opinion. Thus it is 
impossible for a nonspecialist to find his way through this tohu 
vabohu and to form a clear judgment. In consetjuence many have 
only ridicule for all endeavors to give even approximate figures. The 
disagreement even amongst the greatest authorities seems to them to 
show that we can accomplish nothing toward the solution of this 
I)roblem. However, the situation is not so bad as that, and although 
there are many uncertainties which prevent the determination of 
exact figures and which are the cause of the discrepancies among 
scientists, at least a minimum age can be assigned to mankind. In 
the following pages an attempt has been made to derive such a mini- 
mum from the geologic facts and to show that the age of mankind 
can not be less than a certain number of millenniums, although it 
may of course be higher. 

MAN IN THE GEOLOGIC TIME SCALE 

It is impossible to express the age of mankind in the usual measure 
of years, unless we know the position of man in the geologic time 
scale; that is, the relative age of the human race must be found out 
in terms familiar to geologists. In what geologic period did man 
arrive on earth? To be more exact: In what geologic period do we 
find the first unmistakable indications of man's presence? 

It is, first, an established fact that man was witness of the glacia- 
tion in northern and central Europe. His tools and weapons and his

and plants of this cold epoch, in such a way as to demonstrate that 
man was a contemporary of these animals and plants, as, e. g., the 
woolly mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, the reindeer as far south as 
northern Spain. Man utilized the ivory of the mammoth and the 
antlers of the reindeer for the manufacture of his implements. He 
painted these animals on the w^alls of his caves and engraved them on 
his tools. Plants of the arctic tundra are found in the deposits of the 
habitations of man, and shells of clams belonging to the arctic zone — 
Pecten islandicus and Cyprina Islandlca — show that the ocean and the 
fresh water basins were cooled down to arctic temperature, even on the 
northern coast of Spain. Almost innumerable finds illustrate these 
facts and they have been studied with painstaking care by a number 
of specialists all over Europe. 

Secondly, there is unanimous agreement that man was in Europe 
even before the last period of severe cold. In the Somme Valley, 
France, primitive stone implements of man occur in association with 
animals quite different from those mentioned above. The arctic 
forms are w-anting — no reindeer, no mammotli, no animals of the 
tundra. A southern elephant was living there instead of the mam- 
moth, and the hippopotamus, an animal w-hich can not live in waters 
that freeze over, vras found in the rivers of France and England. In 
the same rivers a bivalve, Gorhicula fiuminalis^ w'as common whicli 
is now limited to Asia and Africa. All these facts exclude a glacial 
climate at this period. Moreover, from the Seine Valley calcareous 
tufas have been described, containing plants which require an aver- 
age temperature 4° to 5° higher than is the temperature to-day at 
the same place, Prehistorians designate this stage of human culture 
as Chellean. Now, the following Acheulian stage, whose implements 
of a finer make rest immediately upon those of the Chellean, con- 
tains plant remains of a colder climate and the bones of mammoth 
and reindeer, thus demonstrating that the cold with a new glaciation 
was approaching. 

Hence it is proven beyond any reasonable doubt that man was in 
Europe during a rather genial climate preceding the last glaciation, 
and that he witnessed this process of glaciation from its beginning 
to the complete disappearance of the ice. This conclusion is not based 
on a few stone implements, nor on a fcAv bones of man found some- 
where. It has been reached by the conscientious study of numerous 
prehistoric stations of man throughout central and southern Europe. 
These studies were carried out by well-trained scientists, amongst 
whom a number of Catholic priests, such as Prof, Hugo Obermaier, 
the Abbe Henri Breuil, the Abbes A. and J. Bouyssonie, Prof. F. 
Birkner, are leading authorities. Owing to these researches a great 
number of skeletal remains of man of the glacial period have been

AN ABSOLUTE CHRONOLOGY FOR LATE GLACIAL AND POSTGLACIAL 

TIME 

Are there reliable methods for dating back these geologic events 
and for expressing in millenniums the time elapsed since their occur- 
rence!^ Many attempts have been made in the past to determine this 
time. Most of them did not go beyond rough estimates, leaving mucli 
to subjective feeling and fancy. Tlie cutting of the Niagaia gorge 
below the falls is supposed to furnish a good measure of the time 
elapsed since the recession of the ice, for these falls could not begin 
their work before the ice sheet covering North America beyond New 
York City retreated to a place north of the present falls. But there 
are so many uncertainties in the determination of this time that the 
figures given differ all the way from 7,00U to uy,UUO years. Besides, 
the connection of this event with the appearance of man in Europe 
is still very problematical. Even more open to exception are calcula- 
tions based on the thickness of deposits left in lakes after the 
recession of the ice. 

The study of such deposits in lakes, however, was developed bv 
Prof. Gerard Baron de Gcer, of Stockholm, into a new method 
which is recognized as the best and most reliable one for measuring 
the millenniums since the definite recession of the ice from a given 
locality. Professor de Geer reported on this method and its results 
to the Eleventh International Geologic Congress sitting in Stock- 
holm in 1910.' Since then it has been applied to numerous localities 
both in Europe and in America by De Geer and his students and co- 
workers, and it has found unreserved approval and acceptance f lom 
geologists. 

To illustrate De Geer's procedure we may take an example of a 
recent glacier. The molting waters of the Victoria Glacier in the 
Canadian Kockies (Alberta), after a course of about 1 mile, are 
poured into l^ake Louise, a mountain lake li/i miles long and one-half 
to three-eighths mile wide and 5,700 feet above sea level. During the 
summer months the melting waters of the glacier are turbid and milky 
from the detritus carried away from the melting ice. In the lake

the coarser material soon settles, while the finer clay remains sus- 
pended and falls down very slowly in late fall or winter, when Lake 
Louise is frozen all over with an ice cover about 40 inches thick. 
The deposits at the lake bottom are, therefore, found to consist of 
coarse laj^ers of silt and sand alternating with fine layers of clay; 
the coarse sediments being laid down during the melting period, the 
fine clays during the winter when there is no, or else very little, 
melting of the glacier. There is also a difference in the color of 
these two layers, the winter layer being, as a rule, of a darker hue.* 

The same conditions as observed at present in Lake Louise occurred 
very frequently during the melting of the enormous ice sheets which 
covered the northern part of Europe and North America during the 
glacial period. At many places the drainage of a district was blocked 
by the deposits made by the melting ice sheet, when the front of this 
ice sheet stood for a considerable time at the same spot. As a con- 
sequence when the ice front later receded the dammed-up melting 
waters gathered in lakes, forming coarse layers in summer and finer 
and darker ones in late fall and winter, thus giving origin to banded 
clays. One pair of these bands (or varves, after the Swedish word) 
forms in one year, just as an annual growth ring in trees forms 
during one year. (PI. 1.) 

Such " varved " clays occur on a large scale in southern and central 
Sweden, where the rivers of the late glacial ice sheets, carrying the 
detritus of the ice, poured their water into such lakes. Here De Geer 
began his studies and counted with his students the varves from the 
Scania Peninsula in southern Sweden to Jamtland in central Sweden, 
over a distance of 800 kms. (500 miles). He found 5,000 pairs 
of layers requiring 5,000 years for their formation. Thus the retreat 
of the ice front from Scania to central Sweden occupied 5,000 years. 
This retreat was accomplished slowly in Scania, about 75 m. (250 
feet) a year; farther north it increased to 100 m. (328 feet). Later, 
the melting set in rapidly and the yearly recession was from 100 to 
300 m. (328 to almost 1,000 feet). 

At the end of these 5,000 years the shrinking ice was bisected and 
retreated into the Scandinavian mountains. That was the end of the 
glacial period and the beginning of postglacial conditions. The dura- 
tion of postglacial time was in a similar way determined by counting 
the varves laid down in the postglacial lake Ragunda and in the 
former fjord of Angermanalven. The result was about 8,700 years 
with an uncertainty of 100 to 200 years; i. e., postglacial time lasted 
8,500 to 8,700 years from its beginning until 1900 A. D. Therefore, 
southern Scania was freed from ice 8,700 + 5,000 = 13,700 years, or, 
using the lower figure, at least 13,500 years before 1900 A. D. (In

based on studies in Ka<;unda Lake; these studies were rcj^arded as 
preliminary only; the hi^dier fi<;ure is based on more exact work of a 
later date.)" 

De (Jeer's method was readily accepted and approved on the part 
of geoloi^ists, even when he first reported it to an inteniational au- 
dience and showed characteristic varved clays in Sweden to the mem- 
bers of the Cieoh)<;ic Con<ji:ress. Since then this ajjproN ul lias become 
universal anioni^st <?eolo<;ists and prehistorians. On the occasion of 
the Twelfth International Geolo<]:ic Con«j:ress at Toronto in 1913, the 
Canadian authority on jzlacial ^eolo«ry, A. P. Coleman, said: ''Prob- 
ably the most accurate chronolofjy is that worked out skillfully and 
patiently by Baron de Geer and his assistants."" The French pale- 
ontologist Boule calls De Geer's method " la plus ingenieuse et la plus 
suffisante." ^ Prof. James W. Goldthwait, of Dartmouth College, 
writes in his introduction to Antevs's publication reporting on the 
application of Do Geer's method to America: "An investigation so 
precise in method and execution and so suggestive will give fresh 
impulse to our studies of Pleistocene glaciation." * Robert W. Sayles, 
geologist of the Harvard University Museum, after a careful exami- 
nation of all the factors which might influence the deposition of the 
clays in question, reaches the conclusion : " I feel convinced that the 
seasonal theory is in a very strong position and that the danger of 
its being abandoned is very slight." ° The late Prof. Eduard 
Briickner, of Vienna University, one of the leading authorities on 
the glacial geology of the Alps, accepts unreservedly De Geer's 
method.*" 

Indeed, all modern geologists take it for granted that the chro- 
nology based on clay varves is reliable. There exists no serious 
adverse criticism of the method. Absolute chronologies based on 
clay deposits were regarded with skepticism and mistrust, as long 
as the thickness of the deposits was taken as the measure of time. 
Climatic conditions are so variable and their influence on the amount 
of clay carried along by rivers is so unaccountable that they can 
never aflford precise measurement. This disturbing factor does not 
enter into the new method. Variations in temperature and precipi- 
tation certainly influence the thickness of the clay layers, but these

variations arc no longer unknown quantities; they are plainly legible 
in the varves themselves. In a year with a warm summer the coarse 
portion of (he varve will be thick; in a colder year the varves may 
shrink to small lamellae. Exceptionally rainy seasons and periods 
of excessive heat and drought will undoubtedly modify the deposi- 
tions in lakes at the ice front. But such irregularities can always 
be distinguished from the seasonal varves if the latter are studied 
with due care over large areas. 

De Geer's method has also been applied to varved clays in North 
America during the last decade. Antevs started this work in the 
Connecticut Valley. Varves were counted from Hartford, Conn., 
to northern Vermont, over a distance of 185 miles. Later, a number 
of varved clay deposits were studied in Canada, in Wisconsin and 
Minnesota, and recently by Chester A. Eeeds in New Jersey and in 
the Hudson Valley, New York. 

The researches have even been extended to Argentina in the 
Southern Hemisphere and to the Himalaya region. It has not been 
possible in these cases to construct a continuous time scale as in 
Scandinavia. But the method itself has been firmly established and 
has stood the test by many independent Avorkers in widely separated 
areas. 

EXTENSION OF THE CHRONOLOGY BACKWARDS 

The duration of late glacial and postglacial time in Scandinavia 
has been firmly established by De Geer and his colleagues. In round 
numbers, 13,500 years have passed since central Scania was freed 
from ice. How can this fact be used toward solving the problem of 
the age of the human race? This age is certainly higher than the 
above figure. In the first place, it must be taken into account that 
the ice border halted a considerable time before it melted away, 
forming moraines — that is to say, long stretched hills — composed of 
the detritus brought by the ice. Recently the duration of this stop- 
page, just before its final recession, has been determined by studying 
varved clays laid down by the melting waters of the ice in lakes of 
southwestern Scania and in the Danish islands Sjelland and Fyen. 
(See De Geer, citation 4 above.) This halt of the ice lasted almost 
2,000 years, which, therefore, must be added to the above figure 
13,500. 

Furthermore, it is well known that the ice before this time covered 
the northernmost part of Germany, halting there again for a con- 
siderable time, as is seen from the formation of the very extensive 
elevations, the moraines of the Baltic Ridge, in which lakes and lake- 
lets are abundantly developed, as in the moraines of Wisconsin and 
Minnesota. The duration of this stoppage and the time required for 
the retreat from northern Germany to southern Scania have not yet

from tho rate of rooossion found in Swodon, wliile tho (hiratioii of tho

Provinces of East and AVost Prussia, Pomorania, Mocklenbur<jf-Streh- 
lit/., and tho eastern part of Soldoswjir-JIolstoin were still oovorod 
with mighty ice sheets. (Fig. i.) 

At a still earlier period the ico shoot reached farther south into the 
southern part of tho Provinoe of Brandenburg and south of Poznan 
in Poland. No data are at hand to determine the recession of the ice 
from this area until it reached (ho Baltic liidpe. An estimate of 1.000 
years would, however, bo in fair a<j:reement with the observations 
made farther north. Thus, in all, the ice ben:an its retreat from 
northern Germany about 19,000 years aijo. It must be borne in mind 
that of this fi<;ure a little more than 15,000 years are the result of 
precise measurement. The remainder is a conservative estimate. It 
might well bo that tho ice stood a considerably longer time in noith- 
ern Germany, its border alternately receding and rcadvancing. Thus 
Ernst Antevs arrives at essentially higher figures in his recent pub- 
lication: "In all , the uncovering of the belt between tho Great Baltic, 
or the Pomeranian moraine, and northeastern Scania must have 
taken many thousand years, probably 10,000 to 15,000." " Evidently 
stich assumptions can not be definite, because they are not based on 
the counting of clay varves. Therefore the lower figures are here 
preferred, in order to avoid all statements which can not be proven, 
although the higher figures may bo true or may approach the truth. 

It will be recalled that man during this last glaciation was in 
Europe, struggling with the cold in southern France and northern 
Spain, and as companion of the arctic animals and plants. Further- 
more, it was shown that man was in Europe before this severe cold 
arrived, since he was living with animals and plants requiring 
a much warmer climate not only in southern countries but as far 
north as Weimar in Germany. It is, of course, impossible to recon- 
cile such a mild climate in central Europe with a glaciation and a 
large ice sheet in noi-thorn Geimany. We must, therefore, conclude 
that at that period northern Europe was as much free from ice as it 
it at present, or even more so, if the indications of a higher tempera- 
ture than to-day are reliable. With a new deterioration of the 
climate, then, the ice again took possession of central Enropp. moving 
slowly from Scandinavia to central Germany.

When this last glaciation was at its maximum, man was already living in central and 
southern Europe. 



AGE OF HUMAN RACE EICHARZ 459 

THE DURATION OF THE ADVANCE OF THE ICE 

To determine tlie time neodeil for such a readvance no exact 
methods are at hand. We meet here with many uncertainties and 
unknown quantities which prevent an exact measurement. More- 
over, we do not know how lon<^ the ice front stopped at the greatest 
extension of the inhmd ice, and how long man was in Europe before 
the ice started its readvance. Only an estimate of tiie readvance of 
the ice will be attempted in the following paragraphs. 

The average motion of recent glaciers and ice fields is fairly well 
known. The Alpine glaciers move at a daily rate of 12 to 20 inches. 
There are examples of more rapid motion; this happens where a 
glacier is pushed with high pressure into a narrow valley or where 
the ice slides over a steep slope. Such conditions are, for example, 
responsible for the exceptional velocities of glaciers at the western 
edge of the large ice sheet of Greenland, where daily motions of 
'AS to 66 or even of 105 feet are recorded. It would be wrong to 
attribute such a speed to the whole body of the inland ice. The 
late Prof. Thomas C. Chamberlin long ago warned against such 
a procedure : " There is a widespread misapprehension as to the 
average rate of movement of the ice fields of Greenland. * ♦ * 
In certain fiords, that lead out from great basins into which broad 
fields discharge their ice and their surface waters, and thus furnish 
the conditions for an extraordinary rate of movement, the rate of 
motion, at least during the summer, is unusually high, and these 
exceptional cases have been taken as representative of the movement 
of the border of the inland ice. This is ver}' far from being true. 
The average movement for the whole border of the ice field is quite 
certainly less than 1 foot per day, and it is more likely less than 1 
foot per week." ^^ Others speak of a forward motion of only a few 
meters annually. If it were more, the ice would soon cover those 
j)arts of Greenland which for centuries have been free from ice, the 
wastage of the ice being exceedingly small on account of the short 
melting season. 

The Pleistocene ice sheets were of enormous thickness, and they 
advanced, as a rule, over a flat country, spreading out over a very 
large area. The surface slope, which is of the greatest importance 
for the rate of movement, has been found to be very slight, as far 
as can be ascertained. All this points to a slow motion of the 
clumsy ice masses, although an exact rate can not be given. The 
southernmost portions of the ice may have moved faster than the 
Greenland ice because, reaching into an area of milder climate, the 
greater part of the ice was not far from its melting point. Conse-

460 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

quently, the flow of the ice became easier and the rate of movement 
increased, as is observed in Alpine glaciers far below the snow line. 
Even mider these conditions a motion of 1 foot per day must be 
considered as high. However, assuming such a rate, it would take 
about 11,000 years for the ice to travel the distance of 750 miles 
from its origin in Scandinavia to northern Germany. 

This figure gives an idea of the length of time required for an 
ice sheet to move over great distances. It does not, however, give a 
measure of the advance of the ice border. It is well known that the 
ice in moving forward melts. The amount of melting is in some 
cases so considerable that the ice front recedes, although the ice as 
a whole pushes steadily forward. Thus the front or tongue of the 
majority of the Alpine glaciers is retreating. The melting process 
was undoubtedly also active in Pleistocene time ; during the advance 
of the ice its edge was melting. This wastage may have been small, 
compared with the motion of the ice, especially when the cold was 
at its climax; it may have been considerable when the climate was 
as yet less severe. In any case, on account of this melting, the 
above figure must be increased by an uncertain amount. To simplify 
the problem, this factor may be neglected, bearing always in mind 
that the figure is rather below the real value than above it. 

As the final result of the preceding deductions it can be stated : 
Thirty thousand years ago man was certainly in Europe, living in a 
rather warm period preceding the last glaciation. This figure seems 
to be well established, and no scientist will raise serious objection 
to it so long as it is regarded as a minimum. 

WHY DO GEOLOGISTS ASSIGN A STILL HIGHER AGE TO MANKIND? 

However, the great majority of geologists and prehistorians as- 
sume considerably higher figures for the age of the human race. 
Some reasons for such an assumption have already been alluded to. 
The rate of movement of the advancing ice seems in all probability 
to have been less than that assumed in the present paper, and there- 
fore the time of advance longer. Moreover, the melting of the ice 
during its advance was neglected. Furthermore, how long was man 
living in a genial climate before the temperature dropped to such a 
level that the ice started its advance to the south? There are good 
geological reasons for concluding that the interglacial period pre- 
ceding the last glaciation lasted much longer than the postglacial 
period, which latter had a duration of at least 18,000 years for 
northern Germany. (PL 3.) If man was already in Europe at the 
beginning of the last interglacial, then many thousands of years must 
be added to the above figure. 

Finally, we have to take into account another possibility. The 
cradle of mankind was hardly in Europe, Even from the purely 



AGE OF HUMAN RACE — KICHAHZ 461 

scientific viewpoint one has to look elsewhere for man's birthplace. 
Tlie question then arises: How lonjj; diil man live in his place of 
origin before he migrated into Europe? And even in Europe man 
may have appeared much earlier than dnrin<jj the last inter<jlacial 
period. For his presence durin^j^ this period we have conclusive 
proofs confirmed by numerous observations and by the un;inimous 
a«ireenient of scientists. There are, however, stronjx indications that 
man was in P^urope in the second last inter<rlacial period. The 
human jawbone found at Mauer near Heidelberg in association 
with nianunals of a more ancient type is ascribed by Dr. Hufjo 
Obermaier to this second last interjj^lacial. Likewise, some prehis- 
toric sites containing? stone implements together with the same 
ancient animals (Abbeville, France) are placed in the same period, 
the pre-Chellean, by Father Obermaier,*^ Many other geologists 
place even the Chellean in this second last interglacial period. If 
these views be correct, the age of mankind would exceed the above 
figure by many millenniums, because another recession and another 
advance of the ice must be added and also the unknown duration of 
the second last interglacial period. 

Even so, the possibilities are not yet exhausted. The problem of 
Tertiary man has been very warndy discussed ever since the Abbe 
Bourgeois first advanced such a thesis in 18G3. As skeletal remains 
of man are to date lacking in deposits of this period, tlie whole dis- 
cussion has centered around flints of peculiar shape, the eoliths. Ac- 
cording to some, these indicate manufacture by an intelligent being, 
while others consider them the products of mere natural processes. 
The best experts in paleolithic industry rejected the hypothesis of the 
human origin of eoliths, and thus the problem of Tertiary man 
seemed to l)e settled in the negative. However, about a decade ago 
flints were found in East England, near Ipswich, Suffolk, which re- 
vived the old controversy. These flints, evidently of great age, are 
considered by the great majority of experts as genuine human imple- 
ments, although some specialists still reserve judgment. These im- 
plements are found in two horizons: At the base of the red crag and 
in its upper portion. The red crag is a marine deposit of the u])per 
Pliocene (end of Tertiary time). The shells occurring in this crag, 
especially in its upper part, are partly arctic, announcing (he aji- 
proach of the glacial period. The Abbe H. Breuil, one of the ablest 
and most critical students of paleolithic stone implements, regards 
the flints found in the upper horizon of the red crag as intentionally 
made by an intelligent being. Of a number of the peculiar flints 
occurring at the base of the red crag, he says it is "absolutely impos- 
sible to distingui.sh them from the classical implements" (that is, im- 



" Son : M. Eliert, KoaMexikon rliT Vor;;isclii<-lili', VdI. X. pp. I'-ll iind L'42, " rrrchcUiJcn,"

462 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

plements of later periods which are universally recognized as made 
by man). " The traces of fire are undeniable, whatever may be their 
origin." ^* L. Capitan, another expert, is even stronger in his verdict 
on certain implements of the same place : " If one would deny the 
genuineness of this piece, he must reject the greatest part of scrapers 
of the Mousterian. * * * These are flints purposely shaped by a 
rather skillful hand." ^^ 

Tliose who accept the opinion of these specialists date man as far 
back as the end of Tertiary time, or, what is more to the point, the 
beginning of the glacial period, when the inland ice was for the 
first time advancing toward central Europe. No wonder that they 
figure upon a very high age for the human race. If man was wit- 
ness of three or four advances of the ice, if he was existing during 
two or three interglacial periods each of them of much longer dura- 
tion than postglacial time, figures as high as several hundred thou- 
sands of years do not surprise us. 

The time has not yet come to decide definitely for or against such 
assumptions. Until the skeletal remains of assumed preglacial man 
are discovered, some doubt is possible. It may also be, as Obermaier 
suggests, that the red crag, in which the supposed implements occur, 
belongs to the first glaciation in England (cold climate). If this be 
the case, man living during this period was not Tertiary man, 
although he must have appeared very soon after the close of the 
Tertiary. 

In recent years a number of skeletal remains of a primitive man 
have been unearthed in China. Geological and paleontological 
evidence seems to point to a very high age of this man. Father 
Teilhard de Chardin, S. J., geologist of the Tientsin University, 
gives a succinct report of the discovery in a recent issue of " Primi- 
tive man." ^® According to him Sinanthropus Pekinensis belongs 
to the Lower Quaternary, while Neanderthal man was living in the 
Middle Quaternary. That would raise the figures for the absolute age 
of mankind considerably. 

Up to the present the exceedingly high figures for the age of 
mankind have been derived from tliose theories which take it for 
granted that Europe was repeatedly glaciated, either three or four 
times. There are still geologists who do not accept long inter- 
glacial periods. They assume that the ice never entirely left the 
glaciated area during the whole Ice Age. The interglacial periods 
of others are to them only minor oscillations of the ice front. An

gist, who estimatetl the duration of the entire Ice Age as 17,000 
years and who ascribed to mankind an age of ;50,000 years. There 
are still a few such nionoglacialists left, but their number is fast 
dwindling away. Indeed, it is very difficult to invalidate the 
weighty evidence for repeated advances and recessions of the ice 
fcheets. A warm climate, as is known from deposits lying between 
those of two glaciations, is certaiidy not reconcilable with big ice 
masses at no great distance. If, for instance, in what are evidently 
interglacial beds near Toronto, Canada, remains are found of such 
plants as grow at j)rescnt in southern Pennsylvania, or if close to 
Hudson Bay in simihir deposits tree trunks occur of 18 inches thick- 
ness, the climate must have been at that time even milder than to-day 
and the country must have been free of ice far to the north. 

However, it is still disputed how many times such changes took 
place. The number of glaciations usually is given as three in north- 
ern Europe and as four in the Alps. The overwhelming majority 
of geologists agree that the assumption of at least two independent 
glaciations with a long warmer interval is imperative. Recently an 
anthropologist of Vienna, J. Bayer, drops the first glaciation in the 
Alj)s as unproven, and contracts the last and second last glaciation 
into a single one, only separated by a minor oscillation of the ice 
front. Thus two large glacial periods remain with one interglacial 
period of long duration, in which latter man was present.^" Accord- 
ingly, the duration of the entire Ice Age is considerably diminished, 
altliough even Bayer speaks of about 200,000 years. On account, 
however, of tiie strong opposition of experts, this chronology can 
not be taken as a standard. 

CONCLUSION 

It is evident from what has been said that there are many uncer- 
tainties which block any attempt to assign a definite figure for the 
age of mankind. On the other hand, it would be unreasonable and 
unscientific to reject all figures as uncertain and unreliable. There 
are facts which are obvious and wliich are accepted unanimously by 
all geologists, and these facts warrant the conclusion that man was 
undoubtedly in Europe 30,000 years ago. Of this number of millen- 
niums the first half is determined by exact methods, as set forth in 
this paper; the other half is based partly on an estimate of the reces- 
sion of the ice where this recession can not yet be measured directly, 
partly on a verj' conservative estimate of the time required for the 
advance of tlie ice front from northern to central Europe. Future 
development of these methods as well as new discoveries may raise 
this minimum figure considerably and may ])lacc' on a more solid

basis the theories of those Avho stand for a much higher age of man- 
kind. However, it seems impossible that the figure of 30,000 years 
will ever turn out to be too high as a reasonable estimate of the 
minimum age of the human race. In any case, the present essay 
clearly points out that it is impossible to reconcile the well-known 
facts of human antiquity Avith such figures as 6,000 to 8,000 years. 
No theological problem is involved, it may be added in conclusion. 
Theologians, even the more conservative, acknowledge full liberty 
to deviate from the figures of the older exegesis and declare that the 
problem of the age of mankind is, like that of the age of the earth 
and of the universe, one wdiich has to be solved by secular science.

ELEMENTS OF THE ClT/n'KE OK THE (TKCIMI'OEAU 

ZONE ' 



Ily W. G. BoooBAs 



The Polar, or to put it more correctly, tlie Circumpolar Zone, 
forms a compact ring of dry land encircling the terrestrial sphere, 
which is broken only at two points, the lirst being Bering Strait, 
the second an opening of sea of nmch wider stretch along the line 
Grtenland-Iceland-Xorway. This second opening forms a passage 
from the Polar Ocean into the Atlantic just as Bering Strait forms 
a passage from the Polar into the Pacilic. 

On the whole, the Circumpolar Zone in its complete extent is 
subject to similar conditions and so represents an excellent field for 
the comparative study of a culture, perhaps unique in the world. 
I may add that the culture of the Polar Zone changes very slowly, 
being preserved in a very primitive state in the ice and the snows 
of the Xorth as if it were frozen on purpose for such preservation. 
On the other hand, that culture is more or less uniform even in 
its variation. Severe conditions of the climate make tribes even 
of different origin assume the same inventions and appliances in 
the struggle for life. Thus we find here uniformity of culture and 
of general ways of adaptation to the natural conditions of the 
land. 

The Circumpolar Zone is divided by the Polar Circle into two 
unequal parts: Northward from the Polar Circle extends the tundra, 
and southward from the Polar Circle lies the forest border, that is, 
a belt of undersized trees no more than a hundred kilometers in 
breadth. This belt, from an ethnographical point of view, belongs 
to the Polar Zone and forms a unit with the tundra. The inhabi- 
tants of the tundra, the reindeer, wild and domesticated, and also 
human hunters and reindeer breeders, leave the tundra for the 
winter and go to tiie protection of the forests. 

Still farther to the south, from G5° to G0° of northern latitude, ex- 
tends a zone of den.se forest which must be considered as subpolar

or subarctic, the natural conditions of which form the transition 
from the polar to the more temperate climate. 

Northward from the tundra extends the ocean, which forms a 
special zone; we may call it, perhaps, ultrapolar. In America the 
Polar Ocean, filled with a quantity of large islands and archipelagoes, 
presents a special cultural zone inhabited by the Eskimo. This zone 
has as a typical culture of human groups the hunting of sea mam- 
mals, of larger and smaller kinds. The tundra, or as it is called in 
America, the " barren grounds," is actually barren and the scanty 
human groups inhabiting " barren grounds " have only a very 
precarious existence. 

In Eurasia the relative importance of sea and land is wholly dif- 
ferent. The Polar Sea is actually important for man only in the 
far northeast, where the coast line is clearly cut out and sea game 
come close to the coast so that the hunting of seal and walrus is 
very well developed. Farther to the west the sea becomes shallow 
and the coast low and swampy, so it is mostly left uninhabited and 
only in certain points, more or less distant and isolated, do we find 
the northern populations coming to the sea for hunting. Thus on 
the northern part of the peninsula of Yamal in Siberia and on 
vVhite Island, adjacent to the shore, there lives a branch of the 
Samoyed, walrus hunters and bear hunters, almost wholly unknown, 
which could not be included even in the last census of 1926. No 
scientist has visited these Samoyed. Professor Shitkoff in 1910 spent 
a week among them in the middle of August, but he had no time to 
go over to the northern shore of White Island, where the hunting of 
sea mammals actually takes place. According to some not very re- 
liable information, the Samoyed must have sldn canoes and even 
larger boats made of planks hewn of driftwood. This summer we 
sent there an expedition of three young scientists — Mr. V. N. Cher- 
nezov, Mr. S. M. Ratner, and Miss N. P. Kotovschikova. They 
were taken there by the state steamer and left for a year with ample 
provisions and scientific appliances. So, eventually, they will make 
a detailed description of this branch of the Samoyed.^ 

Still farther to the west hunting of sea mammals is performed in 
midocean, also on Spitzbergen and on Nova Zembla, but this hunting 
is undertaken mostly by the Scandinavians, English, and Russians, 
with larger ships and with the expenditure of considerable capital. 

2 The expedition came baclt in 1930. N. P. Kotovschikova died while staying alone 
on the seashore with all the collections of the expedition, in expectation of the steamer 
from the west. The expedition brought back valuable material, and reported the finding 
by V. N. Chcrnezov of several ruins of half-underground houses of a tribe now extinct, 
which the Samoyed call " Sirchi." These Sirchi once lived in various parts of the 
Samoyed territory but have been extinct for a long time. They were a maritime tribe 
and lived exclusively by hunting the sea-mammoth. Chernezov made some preliminary 
excavations among the ruins, the results of which will bo published in the Memoirs of 
the Academy of Sciences. It is planned to send another expedition to Yamal in 1931. 



CULTURE OF CIRCUMPOLAR ZONE — BOGORAS 467 

On the other hand, the land part of the Circumpolar Zone of 
Eurasia is developeil more tlian in America and it is covered by a 
culture more ancient and more productive. The surface of land in 
the Polar Zone of Eurasia is lar;j;er than that of America (not in- 
cluding islands) and represents about three-fifths of the whole 
surface of the zone. 

The Antarctic zone, which represents for ^eo<;raphers a certain 
important unit, presents very little interest for the ethnoujrapher, 
since it never had any population and up to the present time remains 
outside the ran<j;e of human culture. 

The whole stretch of the Circumpolar zone, from North Cape to 
Berinjx Strait and from Bering Strait to Greenland, presents similar 
natural conditions. These conditions may be divided into five proups 
which are mutually connected but nevertheless represent five different 
points of view. They are: First, cosmo<2;raphical or astronomical; 
second, meteoroloujical ; third, fjeographical («;eolo<;i(.al) ; fourth, 
floral; fifth, faunal. The mutual interaction of these five groups 
forms the natural base upon which the culture of the far north is 
constructed. I will try to give brief characteristics of these groups, 
one after another. 

1. Cosmographical or astronomical conditions of the Polar zone 
are connected with the position of the earth on the ecliptic. Accord- 
ing to this position, the north polar circle forms the southern border 
of the area which has in midsummer the continuous day and in mid- 
winter the continuous night. And so, for instance, on G8°-70° of 
north latitude we have in the Polar zone three or four weeks of con- 
tinuous night in the winter and as many weeks of continuous sunshine 
in the summer. Therefore the transition from night to day in spring 
and the growth of the daytime in the Polar zone is much more rapid 
and striking. Since the equinox is the same for all cosmographical 
zones, the growing of the daytime from zero to 24 hours must go 
with much greater rapidity than in the south. In this way, after 
the 20th of Marcli, the day grows as it were by leaps and in the middle 
of April the glow of the dawn shines throughout the night, and one 
may work and read or write even at midnight. The snow, how- 
ever, is not melted as yet and the frost in the night is sharp enough. 
These conditions produce in the north the .so-called white spring, 
which is the first half of the spring, and lasts much longer than the 
second half, the so-called green spring. Daytime lasts 16, 18, 20, 
22 hours; the night, all ruddy from the glowing sky, 8, 6, 4, 2 hours. 
The snow melts in the midday sun, but the currents of the water freeze 
again at midnight. The difference of the temperature is often 
+ 20** C. —20° C. These daily changes in temperature work on 
the psychology of animals and men like a special tonic, awakening 



468 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

and irritating. Only after the awakening of the spring the living 
beings are ready for the surplus work and intensive sexual and 
emotional life of summer. 

The second half of the spring, the " green spring," begins sud- 
denly with the breaking of ice in the rivers in June and, in 69°-70° 
of north latitude, in July. It is accomplished in three days. Birds 
of passage come in masses ; shoals of fish from the ocean enter the 
rivers; trees and bushes are budding and sprouting; and everything 
is green. So nature, the vegetable and animal life, passes from the 
white spring with its night frosts almost immediately into full sum- 
mer. Summer comes like a sudden leap, like a favorable storm, like 
a yearly mutational period, or some natural revolution. 

2. Meteorological conditions are no less remarkable. While the 
cosmological conditions refer to degrees of northern latitude, to the 
continuous day in summer and night in winter, meteorology deals 
with questions of the degree of frost, of the intensity of wind and 
winter storms, and also of the thickness of the ice sheet and the snow 
layer in the winter. The underground layer of the soil is on the 
Avhole always frozen, and large areas of this ever-frozen ground 
spread far southward even into the Temperate Zone. In the summer 
the ground thaws out, but, even in the southern part of the Yakutsk 
Province, only for three-quarters of a meter, and close to the Polar 
Sea for half a meter or even less. 

On the other hand, the ice sheet on the lakes and on the rivers 
is 2 meters thick or even more. When you want to pierce the ice 
that thick, for setting nets or simply for taking Avater, you have to 
cut with an ice pick a round funnel 3 meters in diameter. The 
person working wall gradually sink down and then completely go 
under the surface of the ice; only the upper portion of his ice pick 
will be seen; and still he will have no water and the ice under his 
feet will be absolutely dry. Even when cut through, the water hole 
must be cleaned up and pierced anew twice a day, morning and 
evening, or else the ice sheet w^ill close again and the hole will shut 
together at least for 2 feet in thickness. 

Then, again, on account of the ever-frozen ground, the rivers begin 
to freeze not only from above but also from beneath. Very soon 
the water flows as if encased in a round tube of ever-frozen material. 
The surface sheet of the ice is formed of small tablets, thin and 
brittle as the thinnest glass, but on the very bottom in the water 
begins to form the bottom ice, the so-called mlo^ which has the shape 
and the consistency of half-dissolved snow. In this double manner 
tlie river freezes with the utmost rapidity. Shallow currents in 
the mountains in more quiet places freeze to the bottom. Then 
the water flows on the surface of the sheet, forming the so-called 
nalhed (ice surface water). This water is immediately covered 



CULTUHE OF riT^CT'MPOT.AR ZOXE — BOGORAS 469 

uith a new sheet of ice, brijjht and smooth as polislierl ^lass. So 
in January one may very well break down throufrh tiiis newly formed 
ice into the coldest water up to the waist and further. 

The frost in January is sometimes 7n° (\ AVhen a person spits 
on the fjround, the spittle falls down upon the snow like an arrow 
of ice. Breath comes out of the mouth with a peculiar raspinp 
sound from the smallest particles of vapor freezing into sleet. A 
horse is surrounded with a thick cloud of its own breathing. A 
man's face, finfjcrs, and toes are frost bitten quite unawares. This 
hapjx'Ds 20 times in a single day after you have succeeded in rub- 
bing them ajrain into warmth. 

The breaking; of the ice on the large northern rivers has also 
some peculiar features. Quite suddenly, the ice sheet breaks into 
huge blocks obstructing the current. The water rises immediately. 
lUocked ice in all streams cuts away great pieces of the steeper 
banks, producing genuine excavations. Stretches of surface 
ground cave in, trees and all. So the breaking of the ice with 
subsequent blockings and risings of the water develops on a scale 
truly majestic and gigantic. River shores, from the upper currents 
down to the very mouth, are covered with masses of floating ice 
drifted ashore. Since rivers of northern Eurasia flow chiefly from 
the south northward, their shores down to the 70° of north 
latitude and even to the very ocean are covered with large sup- 
plies of driftwood, good for fuel and lumber. Practically speaking, 
the lower parts of the greater Siberian rivers, even in the middle 
of the tundra, are surrounded by the artificial protection of the 
forests. 

Joint interaction of astronomical and meteorological agents 
bring forth a marked influence on various sides of human culture. 

For instance, in the spring, during long, almost endless days, 
the upper surface of the snow thawing under the mid-day sun 
and freezing again in the night, gradually turns into a hard crust, 
the so-called nasi in the local Russian dialect. This snow crust is 
of the highest importance for the conditions of spring hunting, of 
the so-called meat-bringing character; Dog, man, and wolf may 
easily run upon the surface of the snow, especially man support- 
ing himself upon skis. But heavier wild reindeer and elk break 
ihrough into the inner, soft snow, cutting their legs against the 
sharp edges of the broken crust, and so they become helpless 
against their pursuers. The Tungus and Yukaghir in the north, 
the Gold and the Samaghir in the Amur country, provide the 
better part of their food lasting for a full quarter of a year by just 
ihis spring hunting of elk and reindeei* on the hard snow crust. 

3. Geogra])hical and geological conditions refer to the conGguration 
of the surface of the land and to the character of the ground. The 
28095—31 31 



470 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

northern part of the Polar zone presents the tundra, as indicated 
above. Most of the tundra is quite flat and damp, soaked with water 
like a very sponge, and having a covering of vegetation, chiefly of 
reindeer moss, which is a kind of lichen. Still there are other vari- 
eties of tundra covering the lower hills and even a part of the moun- 
tains. These hilly tundras are much drier than the flat country. 
The tundra stretches are interrupted in some places with rugged 
mountains, quite naked and desolate, which at certain points, come 
into the sea, forming huge capes. These capes serve as landmarks 
over the long extent of low, slimy seashore. Such are, for instance, 
in Eurasia, North Cape and Cape Taimir, East Cape, Indian 
Point, etc. 

Still, I should mention that all varieties of tundra and of barren 
mountains do not belong to special localities in the west or in the 
east. They are interchanging through the whole extent of the 
Polar circle, appearing again and again in Europe, in Asia, and 
in America, and some cultural phenomena appear in the same 
way spot wise on the whole stretch of the Polar area ; for instance, 
snow goggles and a special ring for protecting the hand against the 
bowstring, etc., have various forms, but each of these forms appears 
again and again in localities separated from each other by hundreds 
and thousands of miles. 

The influence of these geographical conditions on human culture is 
also very important. Let us take the question of communication. 
In winter, throughout the north, communication is carried on with 
sledges ; in summer, the southern hilly part of the zone presents diffi- 
culties of communication almost insurmountable. The inhabitant? 
chiefly various branches of Tungus, may wander around only on rein- 
deer back or even afoot. 

In the northern part of the country, quite flat and covered with 
a maze of rivers and lakes, all having connection, walking on foot is 
quite impossible. The usual means of communication is the canoe of 
varying make, a dugout or a combination of three thin planks, less 
frequently a birch-bark affair — all these are propelled either by pad- 
dling or by special poles thrust into the bottom of the stream, which 
is usually shalloAV. The breaks between the w^aterways are narrow 
and damp, so the paddler is able simply to push along the wet grass 
from one watercourse into another. In this way it is possible to pass 
over from one fluvial system into another even without leaving one's 
canoe for a single moment. If you were to look on such tundra 
country in the summer from an airplane, it would appear to be cov- 
ered with an endless net of blue veins filled with water and combined 
into one system. You could perhaps make a journey from the Obi 
River to the Kolyma having on your feet only the so-called dry-land 
boots, which are utterly unfit for walking in the water, and you would 



CULTURE OF CIRCUMPOL.\R ZONE — BOGORAS 471 

not spoil your dry-land boots, bocauso for overnight stoppin«i: you 
roiild pick out some coiivt-nicMit dry littk' phuc. In extra cases you 
could take off your boots and Avade tlirou<j:li the damp ^rass barefoot. 

4. If we take up now the botanical conditions, we lind them also 
exhibitin<2: several variations. The tundra has a flora of its own. 
The forest border is of course very different, and the sub-Arctic 
dense forest is different from both. These three variations extena 
throuirhout the whole Polar zone. The tundra has chiellv tiie lichens 
and the genuine mosses, some tough sedge grass and patches of 
undersizeil shrubs so rouirh that they can burn and serve as fuel 
without any drying. The forest border has more bushes and even 
a kind of scrub. Undersized trees with crooked trunks and boughs 
out of shape form islands which on the south join gradually without 
interruption. Of black wood species there are the birch, the alder, 
the aspen, the poplar, and several kinds of willow. Birch and 
willow, and of the conifers the cedar, assume a creeping form. The 
birch and willow have also some drooping forms with branches 
hanging down. 

Of the conifers there are the larch and the pine, the spruce, and 
less frequently, the Siberian fir. The larch tree in the forest bonier 
quite frequently gets a crooked trunk bent into a kind of spiral, the 
."-o-called, in lot-al Russian. KpenI) (khkx). The outei- hiyer of that 
"' kren " has a nmch harder consistency and may therefore be applietl 
for various products. 

The sub-Arctic forest has all the species mentioned above, but 
they are more stately and the forest nmch more dense than on the 
northern edge. 

As to the animal species, the reindeer feeds on lichen, which is 
also called reindeer moss. The elk lives on the birch and the alder 
groves, feeding on leaves and bark. The squirrel requires conifers, 
since it feeds upon their cones. Even in the growths of the creej)- 
ing cedar, which in English is called stone i)ine, squirrel and sable 
fare (]uite well, the squirrel feeding on cedar cones and the sable 
on squirrel. 

Eor nnin, the botanical conditions are of direct importance as 
to construction materials for huts and the fuel for heating them. 
The forest even on its border represents the best protection against 
the snow tempests raging in winter. The flat tundra is open to 
every winter tempest and travellers often are buried under the 
snow, in the literal sense of the word, as I had occasion personally 
to experience over and over again. We were bui-ied in drifted snow 
for 24 and even 3G hours, after which we had to cut our way out- 
ward through the snow hardened by the wind like some solid marble. 
Dense forest of the more southeiii belt gives cover against the fiercest 
storm, and the snow in the forest lies soft and downy like a feather- 



472 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

bed. Therefore, the skis in the forest region are made of thin wooden 
planks, broad enough not to sink through the snow. Skis of this 
type are not good for the tundra. The hardened, uneven snow 
surface of the tundra requires a special shape of ski plaited of cord, 
the so-called " raven claws." The natives say that skis of this shape 
leave on the snow traces like the tracks of raven claws, but more 
probably this name is connected with some variation of the raven 
mj^h so important in the folk lore of the Bering region. 

5. Zoological conditions of the north are as follows : Since the 
natural resources of the north from the human point of view are 
mostly of zoological character and the people live on an animal diet, 
we must discuss, one after another, first, sea game, mammals, and 
fishes; second, land animals, wild and domesticated; and third, birds. 

The northern zone is almost wholly unfit for agriculture, even 
for the gardening and raising of vegetables. The principal form 
of the culture is either the hunting of wild animals or the raising 
of domesticated ones. Both forms of economics are based on faunal 
considerations. One deals with Avild animals and the other with 
domesticated. The difference from a general point of view is not 
very important, and the raising of animals is only a result and 
development of hunting of them. The breeding and tlie growth of 
animal life in the north, as elsewhere, is based first and last on 
the abundance of food. The northern zone is not very rich in the 
number and variety of species, but all the richer in the number of 
individuals of the same species and in the celerity of breeding and 
increasing of animal life. The abundance of animal life in the 
north in some cases is almost beyond imagination, surpassing tlie 
chances of the more southern latitudes. From the economic point 
of view the animal supplies of the north are quite sufficient not 
only for the support of its inhabitants but also for export to southern 
i-egions more densely populated than the north. 

What is the reason for the faunal abundance of the north? As 
yet we hardly know any answer to that question. In regard to the 
sea fauna, it is known that the Arctic seas abound with plankton, 
which forms the base and the staple food for all fishes not strictly 
carnivorous. The studies of Russian scientists in the White Sea 
and in the nearest part of the Arctic Ocean try to establish that 
part of the northern sea is far better supplied with plankton than 
the seas of more southern latitudes. In connection with this, fish 
are more abundant in the north. Moreover, innumerable sorts 
of fishes living in temperate and warm zones come over to the north 
and enter northern rivers in order to spawn and propagate. As far 
as I know, the great rivers of the South, the Amazon, Rio de la 
Plata, and Mississippi, having their own fish population, have not 
such masses of wandering fish entering their mouths from the ocean. 



CULTURE OF CIRCUMTOL-VR ZONE — BOGORAS 473 

Tlie same refers to tlie birds ot passage. Muinberless (locks of 
waterfowl of all species come to the north even from the hemi- 
sphere across the Equator. Accorilin»^ to the conditions of the 
climate, they may spend only four months in the north against 
eight months in the south. Nevertheless the north is their usual 
breeding place. Here they have their mating and nesting periods, 
and the short summer time suliices even" for the growing up of the 
young wiu), after that, depart along with the older generation to- 
ward the south, wiiich is wholly unknown to them. To be sure, all 
the northern land is covered with bogs and watercourses and there 
is room enough for the breeding of the young. Nevertheless this 
instinct of migration is very remarkable in the birds of passage. 
One must presume that the migration of birds, with all instincts and 
exertions referring thereto, is not exceedingly ancient. It could have 
originated only in the Quaternary period when the configuration of 
the mountains and the larger areas of land, also the distinctions of 
the climates, already existed on tlie same plan as at present. In the 
Tertiary period the birds of that time probably had no need to 
migrate northward. The climate of the terrestrial globe was more 
uniform, and especially in the north it was moderate and even warm. 

1. Most abundant of all .sections of animal life in the north is the 
class of fishes. Sweetwater fishes also abound in the north. Such 
are for instance the pike and the burbot. Burbot are caught in such 
masses on the Kolyma and the Indighirka Rivers in the time of early 
spring that the burbot livers cut out and frozen together form big 
loads carried across the country with dog teams and pack horses. I 
have seen caravans of pack horses each carrying frozen burbot liver in 
two rectangular blocks of 50 kilograms. But maritime species, namely, 
the salmon, are still more abundant. The migratory salmon of the 
north may be divided into two large groups: Salmon of the genus 
Coregonus belong to the Polar Ocean, and enter the rivers such as 
the Kolyma, the Indighirka, the Yana, the Lena, the Yenissei, the 
Obi. Salmon of the genus Oncorrhyncus belong to the North Pa- 
cific Ocean and enter the rivers beginning from the Anadyr down 
to the Anmr. It is curious to note that Kol3'ma and Anadyr, the 
two great rivers of the northeast, which belong to the same ethnical 
and cultuial area and the sources and headwaters of which meet 
together in the mountains, have fishes of essentially dilTorent genera. 
Kolyma has Coregonus species entering from the ocean, and some 
Sweetwater species of Oncorr/n/iuw^. Anadyr, on the other hand, 
has Oncorrhyncus entering from the ocean and some species of Core- 
gonus of the Sweetwater branch. The species of Coregonus have 
white flesh, those of Om-orrhyn< us, pink fiesli. Both groups in the 
whole period of spawning do not care for any food and even do not 



474 ANNUAL REPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

care much for their own life. But Onoorr'hyncus is much more reck- 
less. In ascending the rivers upstream the fishes of these species per- 
form feats truly acrobatic, since they leap in the more shallow places 
from stone to stone, wriggle on through damp grass, and in other 
places mount the waterfalls. Most of their shoals do not return to 
the ocean and they perish in the river soon after spawning. 

White salmon of the Arctic Ocean as a rule preserve their life 
after spawning and descend the stream back to the ocean, though 
quite exhausted after the exertions of their sexual life. 

According to these points of difference, the pink salmon of the 
Pacific must be more numerous than the white salmon of the 
North, and also much easier to catch. Their greater number 
makes for the great annual loss of life that forms one of the neces- 
sary links of their breeding process. After the spawning the 
pink salmon species, for instance the dog salmon, changes so much 
that itf is difficult to recognize it as the same kind of fish. Not 
only does its flesh become lean and tasteless, but its whole shape 
changes. Its jaws become crooked, forming a kind of beak, and 
the back assumes a form of hump, like the hunch salmon. 

This fall salmon is very poor eating, even for the dogs. On the 
other hand, dogs in the Pacific region as well as foxes, wolves, and 
even sables and ermines, try to catch salmon directly in the water, 
when it passes on mad with the desire of spawning. Anadyr dogs, 
when sold to Kolyma people, in their first polar summer would 
wade into the water, trying all the time to catch some salmon. 
They would usually snatch some smaller piece of wood and then 
desist. It shows very clearly the difference in the way of catching 
pink salmon in the Pacific and white salmon in the Arctic. North- 
ern salmon are not so abundant nor so reckless as to be caught 
out of the water by the very first dog. 

On the other hand, on the rivers entering the Pacific thousands of 
pink salmon, dead from exhaustion, are carried by the wind 
directly to the river banks, where they form ultimately strata of dead 
fish, which are covered by the early snow of October. From these 
natural storehouses bears and foxes feed throughout the year, and 
men take food for their dogs. 

Whole tribes and settlements on the shores of the larger rivers 
of Siberia live exclusively by fishing. This way of living makes 
the village and the house permanent and the people sedentary. 
On the other hand, the culture of these tribes is primitive, and 
psychically the people are passive. The struggle for life is not 
very fierce. Food is always extant. It is caught in a manner more 
or less primitive, for instance with fishing weirs, when large creels 
of willow are choked full with the best fish, or with long nets drawn 
across the river, which also regularly are white with fish caught 



CULTURE OF CIRCUMPOL.\R ZONE — BOGORAS 475 

in every ineyh of the trossoil bark or linen thread. Some Chuckchee 
and Koryak on the Pacific shore do their fishin*; with a short 
net pushed into the water by means of a lon<r pok* 10 ni. in length. 
Since such lou^ poles are but seldom met witli, shorter pieces of wood 
are spliced into one single pole with much ingenuity and even with 
art. The net wlien lH'in<r thrust into tiio water catches iuunediately 
about 10 fat fishes 5 to 7 pounds in wei<;ht. The fisherman draws 
the net back, takes the catch, and thrusts the net into its former 
position. In this manner he can get in 24 hours, without a boat, 
and standin<r on the shore, some 200 or 250 fisiies — 500-700 kilograms. 
This fishing work, of course, is quite exhausting and it is carried 
on only by the poorest of the natives. The method of such fishing 
is truly paleolithic, inasmuch as it presents almost a simple gath- 
ering of the natural supply of food. 

A very imi)ortant detail of the economic and j^olitical life in the 
north is represented by the fact that the Russian Cossacks, hunters 
and traders, a counterpart to the Spanish conquistadores. since they 
also have conquered these immense lands in an almost incredibly 
short time, soon after tiiat settled in the North just like fisher- 
men. The first condition of life for them was an immovable house 
with a regular couch and regular heating. They WTre averse to 
wandering around the tundra with the herd of reindeer just as 
they have objected to the constant wandering of cattle-breeding 
nomads. So the Cossacks intermingled with the fishermen, took 
wives from among them, and assumed from the beginning their 
way of supporting life on fishing and hunting. Still, psychologically 
the hard}' conquerors were wholly different from the passive and 
indolent northern fishermen. But since the women in the new 
settlements of these Russian Creoles and halfbreeds and Russified 
natives were of local origin, the economic and psychical ways of 
the natives were soon prevalent and the fierce energy of the Russian 
invaders was soon gone. If we compare the earlier reports of the 
Cossacks with the Siberian ^'oyevody (governors) for instance from 
the fifties of the seventeenth century, with the reports of their 
immediate successors half a century ago, we find a very marked 
change. Early reports relate : 

We were 17, we descended tlie river looking for some source of fame and 
advantage to His Majesty the Czar, and then we found the native post. It 
was large and strongly fortified, full of armed men. We fought against them 
from morning to evening. And Ood gave us luck; we coiKiuerefl. We have 
killed all the warriors and hurned down the fort. We took captive women 
and children ami took a multitude of costly furs and ready-made clothes. 

In the later reports of the beginning of the eighteenth century, 
we read on the other hnnd : 

Our boats are small and the sails are weak. And we do not know how to 
build large ships, such as were constructed by our fathers. 



476 ANNUAL KEPOKT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

The change in the psychologj^ of tlie Kussian settlers under 
the influence of the Russianized native fishermen is the real cause 
why the Russian parties of Cossacks and soldiers in the eighteenth 
century could not subdue the fierce Chuckchee tribe. The party of 
Major Parlatsay in 1747 was utterly defeated and he was taken 
captive and tortured to denth simply because the ancient warlike 
ardor was not there. 

Up to the present the mutual relationship between the Russianized 
natives and the Chuckee reindeer breeders is quite peculiar. From 
the economic point of view the Chukchee, as the animal breeders, are 
of a higher stage than the fishermen of the Russian villages, while in 
other things the Russian and Russianized natives are much higher 
than the Chukchee. In this way the Russians who were and are the 
domineering race, at the same time were living like mendicants and 
parasites on the boons from the wealth}^ reindeer breeders of the 
tundra. 

2. Hunting of sea mammals, in contrast to fishing, is practiced on 
the sea, often even amidst the open water, or on the brink of the ice 
fields about to break up, but never by hand from the shore. The psy- 
chical character of the maritime hunters is quite different from that of 
the fishermen. Northern hunters are mobile, always on the alert, 
ready to go away into the open, given to wandering for many and 
many miles. It has been the custom of the maritime Chukchee and 
the Asiatic Eskimo to go over to America from very ancient times. 
Even now they make quite long trips across the ocean. The Koryak 
are much more passive, but they are fishermen rather than sea- 
mammal hunters. 

The difference between the fishermen and hunters of sea mammals 
is expressed in the choice of the site even on the sea coast. The 
settlements of fishermen are on the river shore, in the inner estuaries, 
or on the inland side of some adjacent island. The settlement of a 
hunter of sea mammals is established on the outer capes or on the 
windy side of an island where there is always a chance for the sudden 
pursuit of a group of seals or a big walrus or even a whale. 

The species of sea mammals are more or less alike throughout the 
Polar ocean of Eurasia — whales of various kinds and sizes, one or 
two with precious whalebone, others giving only meat and blubber, 
white whale and killer whale, and two varieties of walrus: Of seals, 
ground seal, Plioca harhata; ribbon seal, Plioca fasciata.; and of 
smaller seals, Plioca greenlmidica^ Phoca vittdina^ Phoca phoetida,, 
and Phoca hasjnda. I could mention several names in Russian Creole 
and native languages, but the trouble is that these names change from 
one district to another, being given nt one time to one sj:)ecies, another 
time to another. The white polar bear is also to be included among 
the sea mammals. Of these the natives distinguish several varieties,

one not very u«i[<^rt.'.s.'>i\t.' in iiRct-iiig" with iiuiii, aiuilluT lii'icx' ainl 
bloodthirsty. Sea-uianimal himtinj^ is combined with reindeer breed- 
inj^ anions the C'hukehee and with li.-^hini; armtni; (he Km yaic and 
Kanicliadal. 

Overland animals are hunted by a series of overland tribes among 
whieh are the 'riui^us in lli groups. 

Overland huntin<j repre^-ents two branclie.-^, one iov meat con- 
sumption, referring to the herbivora, and another for tiie fur market, 
referring to the carnivora, including the smaller kinds, such as sable, 
ermine, etc. Before tiie advent oi" the Russians hunting for meat 
prevailed; people did nt)t know what to do with furs of these and 
other species, while they had no other food except the meat of the 
game. 

The first place among the meat-supplying species belongs to the 
reindeer, wild as well as domesticated. Wild reindeer are on the 
constant decrease. The domesticated herds, notwithstanding the 
losses of the last 10 years, still contain more than 2,500,000 animals. 
The mutual attitude of wild and domesticated herds is more or less 
exclusive to each other. This was demonstrated in the middle of 
the nineteenth century, when the Chukchee, on the invitation of the 
chief oilicer of the Kolyma, receiving at last assurance that no 
harm should happen to them, moved with their herds westward even 
Bcross the Kolyma Kiver to the western tundra, and the herds of wild 
reindeer had to leave the pastures of that country and go elsewhere. 
Some of them migrated to Anadyr. JMost of thenj were dispersed 
and destroyed. 

As a result the Yukaghir and the Chuvantzy Tribes, who lived on 
the eastern affluents of the Kolyma and relied for their sustenance on 
yearly hunt^ of the numerous herds of wild reindeer in the spring 
and in the fall, were suddenly deprived of their means of existence 
and perished by direct starvation. Some remnants of them emigrated 
to the lower Kolyma Kiver and took to lishing. Those who stayed on 
the spot in some cases were driven even to cannibalism. 

The other meat-supplying species is the huge elk of Siberia, now 
mostly exterminated. The last remnants of the former abundance 
are to be found in the southern course of the Kolyma Kiver and in the 
valley of the Amur. 

The brown bear in the forest land, the hare on the tundra, the 
mountain sheep in mountainous regions, even squirrel, marmot, and 
spermophillus, also serve for food. The Maritime Cliukchee and the 
Asiatic Eskimo consume the meat of the polar fox, and the Reindeer 
Chukchee occasionally eat mice, but all these supplementary sources 
are of small importance. 

By the way, the hunting of sea mammals belongs to the first branch 
of meat-producing character. Meat, oil, and Ijlubbor — these are the 



478 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

principal products of the hunting of sea mammals. Walrus hides and 
sealskins are used chiefly for the needs of the hunting people. Only 
the fur seal, the polar bear, and the very rare sea otter supply pelts 
that are marketable. 

The second branch of the overland hunting developed only since 
the advent of Russian merchants and officers, or in the American 
part of the Polar zone with the advent of English, American, and 
Canadian traders. 

Three hundred years ago the northern countries were teeming with 
costly sable and ermine. Now the hunting of such fur-bearing ani- 
mals is greatly reduced. Squirrels and polar foxes alone go on 
breeding, thanks to their wide distribution and fecundity. 

At all events, several grouf)s of hunters in the north exist in a 
peculiar way. They can not get enough meat from the meat-supply- 
ing species, so they live exclusively by hunting the fur bearers, chiefly 
the squirrel. They sell the pelts, of whatever kind they succeed in 
getting, and then buy some grain of the lowest quality which they 
grind by hand grindstone and make into unleavened cakes. So these 
hunters practically have passed from their natural economic state to 
a condition in which exchange predominates. The Russian peasants 
of the neighborhood live in a condition of natural economics, for 
they consume the best part of their own harvest and sell only the 
surplus of the product. 

I have tried to indicate five groups of natural conditions, one after 
another, and the human culture developed in these surroundings on 
the basis of the conditions as enumerated. Man in the north 
lives wholly under the power of nature, and if we take three groups 
of cultural phenomena — the material, the spiritual, and the social 
culture — we notice that all of them are influenced with great force 
and strictness by several groups of conditions mentioned above. 

I will cite two examples, referring, respectively, to the material 
and the spiritual culture of the northern tribes. 

The first is connected with the question of fuel. Fuel is scarce 
on the tundra and the inhabitants had to work out a method of heat- 
ing without any fuel at all. The Chukchee, the Koryak, and the 
Asiatic Eskimo have their sleeping room heated chiefly by the accu- 
mulation of human natural heat, which can even be regulated by 
accepting new guests or, in case of excessive temperature, by trying 
to send away some who constitute the surplus. The Eskimo construct 
for heating purposes an underground house with an inner sleeping 
room, the protective walls of the underground room being made of 
earth and sod. 

The Reindeer, and partly the Maritime Chukchee, construct their 
huts and the inner sleeping rooms from the best reindeer skins. 
This translation from one material into another reminds one of the 



CULTURE OF CIRCUMPOL\R ZONE — BOGORAS 479 

Chukcliee langiia«re, which is ulso the transfer of the Eskimo 
m()rpholo<ry into some unknown lin<;uistic elements of aneient Asia. 

Tlie second example refers to the spiritual culture. It deals with 
the folklore. Xoithern people of whatever race or culture stage, 
havin*^ little else to do throujjhout the endless ni<i;hts of winter, fill 
their leisure with workin*^ out the elaborate schemes of stories 
adorned with the finest embroidery of imagination. That accounts 
for tlie development of folklore among the northern tribes and even 
for the develoi>ment of Scandinavian epics among the Norsemen 
in Iceland in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. 

With the Maritime Chukchee and Asiatic Eskimo the folklore 
develops in conditions of a tlitferent kind. These two tribes often 
even in the midst of winter, being short of stored provisions, must 
get their sustenance from the continuous search for seals. A fierce 
winter storm, keeping them at home sometimes for several days, may 
put them on the brink of starvation and what is still worse, deprive 
their lamps of the light-giving oil necessary for dispelling the 
ojipressive darkness. And sometimes the best hunters will come out 
through the storm alwaj^s in pairs, joined together with a long 
thong in order to feel always sure of the mutual touch. The folk- 
tales are full of such desperate attempts when the people begin 
" to get lean in their marrow bones." These stories are usually 
repeated at night, when the inmates are pent up within the sleeping 
room, and they are considered as the best incantations against the 
storm. The close of the tales is also an incantation of its own, 
" Waho, yoochin tinmugan," "Oho, I killed the tempest! " By the 
way, stories related during the winter storms must refer chiefly to 
storms, to work against them the more efficiently. The connection 
of meteorological conditions with the evolution of folklore is quite 
clear. 

Some of the old women know so many tales that they are able for 
a month or more to present a new tale every day, intertwining to- 
gether the subjects and plots with great art. 

Out of these natural conditions the culture of the North has 
developed. Though we call it primitive, we must not compare it with 
the most primitive culture of some tropical tribes, such as the Boto- 
cudo or the Bushmen. These last tribes go around quite naked, have 
no house to speak of, and feed on anything that comes their way and 
which they can gather without much effort in the wood or on the 
prairie. Their economics belong to the earlier stage of the so-called 
collector type. They store no provisions, and notwithstanding the 
abundance and even the lavishness of natural supplies in the South, 
they pass from one spell of hunger to another, interspread with a 
much shorter period of reveling in plenty. 



480 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

Now ill the northern conditions, one can not go on without clothes, 
house, and storage for the winter. Even primitive man must take 
care of his future, otherwise he w^ill die. This is why the culture of 
the North is not only of a well-developed type, but even has a special 
development. 

The Eskimo culture, which represents the best developed variation 
of the culture of the North, abounds in implements and accommoda- 
tions of amazing fitness. Some of these were imitated not only by 
their nearest neighbors to the south, but even by the civilized part of 
humanity, such as the Russians and Americans. The whaling har- 
poon is an Eslrimo creation, but it was imitated by almost all the 
tribes which practice whaling. 

In the classification of the cultural types of the North, we find some 
types of local origin, such as fishing, hunting, reindeer breeding, and 
other types of a higher culture, Avhich came to the North in later 
times brought over by immigrants from the South. I will start with 
the classification of the indigenous cultures. 

As for implements and weapons with some few exceptions, the 
tools of the North are Neolithic. To be sure in the last hundred years 
some metal work and the art of weaving has spread among the natives 
in imitation of the Russians, and, in the far east, of the Chinese. 
Still, even the shape of the tool or the weapon made of metal, 
curiously imitates the form of the stone or bone implements. For 
instance the Reindeer Chuckchee use instead of the axe a small 
hatchet, an actual tool of the Neolithic period. The local blacksmiths 
of Russian origin prepare such hatchets especially for Chukchee use. 
Nevertheless, most of the northern tribes have even some blacksmiths 
of their ow^n, capable at least of mending the simplest iron imple- 
ments. Some of these tribes still have an idea that the art of the 
blacksmith requires skill and knowledge of no common kind. The 
Chukchee, for instance, in some tales borrowed from Russians 
describe a young prince, the son of the king, as having a face as 
intelligent as a blacksmith's. 

According to the chief pursuit bringing the means of life, the 
northern culture may be divided into several types. I must men- 
tion that notwithstanding their primitive character, the northern 
culture created two branches of animal breeding, the breeding of 
domesticated reindeer and that of driving dogs, peculiar to the north- 
ern zone. Within that zone, however, it is imitated from the native 
tribes by the most civilized immigrants of later arrival. The Amer- 
ican settlers in Alaska imitated Alaskan Eskimo doc: driving and 
Siberian reindeer breeding, which has prospered and increased at 
such an amazing rate. 

Also in fishing and hunting, the northern natives have created 
various implements, afterwards imitated not only by later immi- 



CULTURE OF CIRCUMPOLAR ZONE — BOGORAS 481 

grants from the South, but also passed over to the neighboring 
people of more southern latitudes. Such is for instance the small 
Siberian trap for ermine and other small irame, whicli has spread 
through the whole temperate zone of eastern Eurasia down to the 
Bashkir and the Kirgiz. The same is the case with the larger 
striking trap for foxes, the deadfall for foxes and walrus, etc. 

Moreover, we can see that in the economics of hunting the fur- 
bearing animals the northern natives of the so-called primitive 
tribes are the most circumspect in looking out for tlie future. While 
the Russian invaders from the South ruthlessly destroy the best cedar 
forests with their axes or careless fires, and exterminate the " green " 
squirrel when the "' unripe " peltry is not fit for selling, the Tungus 
or Ostyak, when undisturbed by neighbors, will proceed with much 
more forethought, trying to leave some of the foxes and squirrels for 
his last days and even for his children. 

I will only repeat one of the paragraphs of my memoir on the 
" Conditions of Life of the Lesser Tribes of the North," presented 
in 1023 to the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets: 

The principal riclics and resources of the North are not represented by the 
numlierk'ss shoals of fish, nor by the endless droves of wild geese and swans, 
nor by herds of reindeer, wild and doiiiesticatcd, jind not even l)y the fields of 
coal or veins of gold to be brought into the mining work ; the real riches of 
the Far North, the most important of all, are represented by the northern 
IH-'ople, who are the only means and agents to work out profitably all the 
natural resources of the North and to bring them in touch with human culture. 
Without the northern tribes, the riches of the North will be left without use 
and without workers. 

After these i)reliininary remarks, I will indicate the chief types of 
the northern culture as the following: 

1. Fishing, 

2. Hunting, with two subdivisions: (a) Meat-providing branch; 
(b) fur-providing branch. 

The other subdivisions, according to areas of exploitation are: 
(1) Overland hunting; (2) sea-mammal hunting. 

Economic ])ursuits, as mentioned above, less frequently appear in 
the exclusive form, but oftener as combinations of two or three types, 
with one prevailing, or with two or three of equal importance. 

So, for instance, the hunting of fur-bearing animals is combined 
either with fishing, or with overland meat-providing hunting, or 
with hunting sea mammals. Some tribes combine everything — fish- 
ing, overland meat providing, hunting of fur-bearing animals, and 
hunting of sea mammals. Such are the Maritime Koryak and the 
Gilyak. The Maritime Chuckchee have very little fishing, since the 
Chuckchee Peninsula has no rivers for the fish to enter for spawn- 
ing, and salmon do not go this way; and, of course, the inland 
Tungus or Yukaghir have no hunting of sea mammals. 



482 ANNUAL, EEPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

3. The third type refers to the higher cultural stage, since it deals 
with the breeding of domesticated animals, viz, reindeer. 

Still the breeding of reindeer in all its ways and methods is so 
primitive as to rank on a level with hunting and fishing. 

Moreover, in several cases, the reindeer breeders, though economi- 
cally better off, are in other respects even behind their fishing or 
hunting neighbors, who for instance practice various handicrafts and 
then exchange their artifacts for the produce of reindeer breeding. 
Reindeer breeding also enters into combination with hunting and 
fishing. In northern Eurasia, as a general rule, the tribes of hunters 
do not wander afoot, but have some reindeer to supply the necessary 
means of locomotion. The Tungus hunter can not very well do 
without riding reindeer. Reindeer mounts supply the Tungus with 
the means for wandering over immense areas, and only by means 
of the riding reindeer could the Tungus spread over 10,000 kilometers 
in extent from the eastern affluents of the Obi River down to Kam- 
chatka and Saghalien, and from 70° of northern latitude in the 
tundra down to the south, beyond the Chinese border. On the other 
hand, extensive reindeer breeding does not come very well into com- 
bination with fishing, because fishing presupposes a stay on the shores 
of lakes and rivers, which have not sufficient lichen pastures and are 
too much pestered by mosquitoes and reindeer flies. Extensive rein- 
deer breeding presupposes continuous wandering with the reindeer, 
while fishing is much more sedentary. 

At the same time, the better half of the northern tribes include 
both types of pursuit practiced side by side, reindeer breeding and 
fishing, or, with the Chuckchee, hunting of sea mammals. Some 
tribes are divided into two branches, the reindeer breeding, who 
wander throughout the tundra, and the sedentary, dwelling close 
to the water and out of the water. The ways of life of both these 
branches are often not only different but even antagonistic, as with 
the Chuckchee, Avhere the driving dogs of the sedentary people rep- 
resent the bitterest foe of the reindeer herds, and so the reindeer 
breeders can not even come into the neighborhood of the Maritime 
villages. 

Still, both parts of the tribe are conscious of their natural tie and 
consider themselves to be of the same tribe. They intermarry freely 
and in case of need act as one unit. It is open to question whether 
they represent one natural unit practicing two pursuits of life, or 
two different units who have brought out two different ways of life 
and then gradually blended. 



THE TELL EN-NASHKII EXCAVATIONS OF 1929 
A PRELIMINARY REPORT' 



By William Frederic Bad^ 
Director of the Palestine Inxtitnte aitd the Tell en-Naabeh Expedition 



[With 8 plates] 
INTRODUCTION 

Tell en-Nasbeh is the modern Arabic name for a commandinj^; liill 
which lies 7 miles (13 kilometers) north of Jerusalem. The main 
road of north-and-south travel between Jerusalem, Nablous (Sche- 
chem), Nazareth, and Haifa, pasties close to the eastern base of the 
hill. But durinf^ Graeco-Roman times, and presumably throughout 
earlier periods of Palestinian history, tlie main line of communica- 
tion j)assed tiirou<rh the narrow valley which lies along the western 
edge of the hill. The latter was ideally situated for the erection of 
a fortress city commanding the southward approaclies to Jerusalem. 
A number of j-ears before the inauguration of the present excava- 
tions, in 1926, several close students of Palestinian geography, among 
tliem R. P. L. H. Vincent, W. J. Phythian-Adams, and Prof. Gustav 
Dalman, have expressed their conviction that the mound in question 
covers the remains of Mizpah, which anciently belonged to tiie tribal 
territory of Benjamin (Judg. 20:1; I Sam. 7:5; 10:17; I Kings 
15:lGff.). Three seasons of excavation since then have brought to 
light much evidence which supports this identification. The city 
was completely refortified about 9(X) B. C, a fact wliich agrees with 
the notice in I Kings 15 : 22, that Asa, King of Juda, fortified IMizpah 
against the attacks of Baasha. There were uncovered, among other 
things, the foundations of a sanctuary and a place of sacrifice such 
as Mizpah must have possessed according to Biblical accounts. The 
last reference to Mizpah in ancient records (I Mac. 3: 46) states that 
the place was used as a stronghold by the noted Jewish military 
leader, Judas Maccabaeus. Extensive Maccabaean structures, dated 
by coins, were found in 1929. The excavations are to be continued 
in 1932.

During the excavation seasons of 1926 and 1927 we had succeeded 
in clearing a large portion of the southern end of Tell en-Nasbeh, 
including the great outer city wall (Bronze Age) and a narrower and 
still older inner wall. At one point we found unmistakable indica- 
tions that a gate had pierced the Bronze Age wall, but so far up in 
the masonry that its subsequent destruction carried away also the 
remains of the gate. During the first phase of the Iron Age, when 
the remains of the city wall lay buried in debris, a road led over 
the top vi^here the Bronze Age - gate had formerly been. There are 
good reasons why the road should have clung to this particular spot ; 
within, it was the approach to the sanctuary precinct ; without, to the

In 1929 we laid our plans for an exploration of the Tell from the 
north end. Contours revealed by the German airplane photograph 
seemed to indicate the existence of a gate at that end. Operations 
were begun on March 15 by cutting a wide trench through the extra- 
mural debris along a line at right angles to the clearly marked edge 
of the city wall. On reaching the outer face of the wall I found, to 
my great surprise, that it was leaning outward at so sharp an angle 
that it was impossible, even after shoring it up, to remove all the de- 
bris without endangering the lives of the workmen. At one point the 
talus of rock leaning against the wall showed unmistakably that 
it had resulted from the outward collapse of an upper section of 
the wall. Not far from its base were the remains of a retaining 
wall and beyond it a moat excavated in the limestone bedrock. This 

=* In his attempt to prove that Tell en-Nasbeh could not have been the Mizpah of Benja- 
min, Probst H. W. Heitzberg (cf. ZAW, 1929, p.p. 195-90) has fallen into strange errors. 
He overlooks the fact that the gate found in 1927 at the south end of the Tell was in the 
Bronze Age wall, and therefore can not be used for an argument about Israelite use 
during the Early Iron Age. The Israelites had a well-marked road over (he top of the 
demolished Bronze Age wall at the point where the Bronze Age gate had formerly been. 
The road made a direct approach to the sanctuary precinct. 

Equally beside the facts is his assumption that the sanctuary found in 1927 did not 
antedate the ninth century B. C. On p. 15 of my preliminary report, I have stated ex- 
plicitly that both the first and the second phases of the Iron Age (1200-586 B. C.) were 
well represented by house levels and cistern deposits, and the sanctuary was a part of 
both of them. On p. 38 I also refer to evidence of the probablL- Maccabaean use of the 
high place. Last summer's exca\ation had made this a practical certainty, for extensive 
Maccabaean levels were uncovered, which integrate with Maccabaean surface remains 
found in and around the sanctuary in 1927. We have also good evidence to show that 
the use of the high place reaches back into pre-Israelite times. In AL22 our general 
map (cf. frontispiece of preliminary report) exhibits remains of what was doubtless an 
earlier sanctuary, not under, but beside, the later one. Hertzberg's reference for his 
dating of the sanctuary into the ninth century was based on a quotation from a monthly 
expeditionary news bulletin of June 1927, in which no attempt was made to fix a com- 
prehensive date for the sanctuary, because the excavations were still in progress. In 
short, his two main contentions, so far as the writer's preliminary report is concerned, 
are completely erroneous. For nothing is better established than that Tell en-Nasbeh was 
an Israelite and Jewish city from 1200 B. C. to the beginning of the Christian era, so 
that the sanctuary still remains der gewichtigste Grund against Hertzberg's general 
argument.

moat was subsequently found at two other widely separated points 
where we made sections through the extramural debris, and must 
be regarded as a well conceived part of the city's defences. 

In the course of the summer we cleared a crescent of more than 
a hundred meters of the wall, with adjacent city areas, but no trace 
of a gate was found at the north end. However, in view of the size 
of the city, it seems certain that there must have been another gate 
besides the one at the south end. Two stretches of city wall still 
remain to be excavated, one on the west, the other on the east side 
of the Tell. Since, anciently, the north-south road passed on the 
west side of the Tell, the probabilities are in favor of a second gate 
on the west side. This is a problem that still awaits solution. One 
more season will enable us to complete the excavation of the entire 
mound and so find the answer for this as for a number of other 
questions. 

NEW FEATURES OF THE CITY WALL 

The attack upon the Tell from the north end has had the advan- 
tage of revealing the fact that the city's defenses have had a more 
complicated history of construction than appeared from the earlier 
excavations at the south end. For instance, the inner and older city 
wall was not found at the north end, and hence no intramural area, 
filled in its upper level with grain bins. The main wall itself showed 
striking differences of construction. The builders had first exca- 
vated a wide trench, carried to bedrock, and this they filled to a 
height of 2 meters with loose rocks, mostly small. Upon this bed 
of rock fill the wall was built with courses of large stones, laid with 
clay mortar. The steady and increasing pressure of accumulating 
debris against the inner face of the city wall had gradually pushed 
it out so that, in spite of its great thickness, it began to lean outward 
more and more. This action was facilitated by the loose founda- 
tions and the absence of all counter pressure against the outer face 
of the wall, which coincided with the edge of the sharply descending 
rock slope of the hill. Ultimately it became necessary to save the 
wall from total collapse by building a buttress wall along the outside. 

The structural peculiarities of this north-end wall made it neces- 
sary to ascertain, if possible, whether it was built at the same time 
as the Bronze Age wall at the south end. I had two sections cut 
through it, and the potsherds found in the masonry were carefully 
collected in baskets and labeled according to the successive courses 
of stones. There were numerous Early Bronze Age fragments, but 
a considerable proportion of the potsherds belonged to the Iron Age, 
a decisive indication that the wall, at the section points, could not 
have been built earlier than the Iron Age. The lowest course of 
the wall yielded only Early Bronze Age pottery, but this may have 



TELL EN-NASBEH EXCAVATIONS — BADE 487 

been accidental, for there was no structural ilillereiice between the 
upper courses and the lowest. At the present stiijje of the excava- 
tions it seems prol)abie that dui-inj; the IJivmze A<;e only the southern 
half of the Tell was inclosed by a wall, and that the northern end was 
included during the Iron Age. In that case we should expect a 
wall to bisect the Tell somewhere near the center. 

SUBURBS 

One of the interesting results brought to light by the progress of 
this season's excavations is the fact that tlie ancient city extended 
considerably beyond the area included within the walls. There 
were what one might call suburbs which covered the comparatively 
broad, level terraces on the eastern and southern flanks of the Tell. 
The existence of an Iron Age suburb on the southern slope had 
been established during the excavations of previous years. During 
the season of 1020 I decided to cut a trench 20 meters wide from a 
point far outside the city wall directly up the eastern slope. Imme- 
diately beneath the tilled surface of the ground we found house 
foundations, silos, and cisterns with an abundance of first and second 
Iron Age pottery- which coincided in fabric and forms with that 
found in the two upper levels on the Tell. Here there was evidence 
of a populous and prosperous city which occupied not only the top 
but also the flanks of the Tell during the Biblical period between 
the Judges and the Exile. As the trench was pushed into the talus 
of the final sharp slope of the Tell the workmen uncovered the 
mouth of a large cave. (PI. 5.) Above it was a retaining wall, 
evidently of Israelite construction, for in its face were some squared 
stones not made for the use they now' served. They had done earlier 
service somewhere in the upper courses of the main city wall. Be- 
yond the rod-wide terrace of debris held in by the retaining wall, 
rose the city wall itself, based on rock, 16 feet thick, and well con- 
structed. 

THE CAVE 

When the cave was excavated its stratification furnished an epit- 
ome of the human history of the Tell. Occupation and use of the 
cave had ceased about 700 B. C, a period corresponding to the 
invasion of Sennacherib. Thereafter, apparently, debris began to 
accumulate over the opening. The upper layer of deposits, com- 
paratively deep, contained all the characteristic forms of Iron Age 
pottery. Beneath this was a Middle Bronze Age stratum, and the 
lowest level, separated from the next above by a compact earthen 
floor, contained numerous fragmentary human remains mingled 
with Early Bronze Age pottery. There was no clearly recognizable 
Late Bronze Age stratum. In this respect the occupation levels of 



488 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

the cave coincide with the stratification on the Tell where charac- 
teristic Late Bronze Age pottery is absent or represented sparingly. 
There is enough to indicate that further excavations may bring to 
light a Late Bronze Age occupation of the Tell. 

In short, the evidence points to a first use of the cave by Early 
Bronze Age inhabitants of Palestine as a place of burial. Remains 
of 14 persons could be made out, but there may have been many 
more before the cave was cleared for occupation as a dwelling-place 
during the Middle Bronze Age. There is a suggestion of a sudden 
tragedy for the Early Bronze Age people in our discovery of a small 
kiln filled with pottery that had not been fired. It was at the 
entrance of the cave, and the pottery, made of a greenish clay, may 
have been intended for funerary purposes. Before the firing could 
take place an evil fate overtook the living and probably the dead. 
The Middle Bronze Age stratum of the cave contained many objects 
of great interest, among them a terra-cotta couch of a unique design. 

INTRAMURAL AREA 

Above the cave, and within the city wall, our excavations con- 
nected with those of 1926. Here again we struck the two city walls, 
tlie outer and the inner, and in the space between them were numer- 
ous circular grain bins, like those found during the previous year. 
Along the inner wall ran a paved path over which purchasers and 
vendors, camels, and donkeys, came and went when this part of the 
city was a busy grain market. Thirty or forty meters farther north 
the inner circuit wall gradually turned westward away from the 
main wall, thus widening the intramural area. This wider space 
was at this point occupied by a moderately large square building, 
divided into four rooms, arranged exactly like those in the Israelite 
sanctuary discovered on the west side of the Tell in 1927. One 
room, about 8 by 30 feet, ran across the entire width of the building. 
Three others ran at right angles to it, and the central one was the 
largest. It contained a large circular-walled structure like a stor- 
age bin, about 2 meters in diameter, a stone basin, and a kind of 
table made of two flat stones. Among the objects found in the 
rooms were a terra-cotta dove, the torso of an Astarte figurine, and 
a small saucer lamp nested in the 3-branched fork of a tree, all in 
terra cotta. The lamp had been covered with white slip and then 
painted red, just like the Astarte figurines. Therefore it probably 
had religious significance and was of a votive character. The dove, as 
is well known, was a bird sacred to Astarte. So far as the evidence 
warrants a conclusion, we are concerned here with a sanctuary of 
Astarte, the "Queen of Heaven" (Jer. 44, 17). It may be added, 
as a significant fact, that in the immediate neighborhood of this 



TELL EN-NASBEH EXCAVATIONS — BADE 489 

structiiro. lieads of Astarte fijrunnos were especially niimorous. and 
a conical baetyl, or via-;<'<(hah, was also recovered in this vicinity. 

NATl'IJIO OF TIllO CI rV I,i:\ KLS 

So far as the levels within the city walls are concerned, this year's 
excavations «^ave us certainty on many points that were previously 
left in doubt. At the north end the uppermost level, not unifonnly 
preserved, was Hellenistic, chiefly Maccabaean. Next came a stratum 
which yielded chiefly II, but also I, Iron Age pottery, especially 
in areas near the cit}' wall. Sometimes there were two house levels 
in this stratum, the lower level having been partly reused in the 
upper. Sometimes this took the form of new floors within the same 
house walls. The lower, or Early Iron Age, level was always the 
best marked and indicated a long and continuous occupation of the 
city during that i)eriod. A considerable amount of so-called " Phil- 
istine " ware was recovered from this level. The third stratum 
must in the main be described as belonging to the Middle Bronze 
Age. But it had a large admixture of Early Bronze Age potteiy, 
which may be regarded as intrusive. Remains of larger structures, 
kilns, and silos, had more successfully survived the digging activities 
of the Iron Age inhabitants. The final and lowest stratum, that of 
the Early Bronze Age, was in contact with bedrock. It had been much 
disturbed, and was found unmixed only in silos and natural cavities 
in bedrock. Large (juantities of ledge handles were found in all the 
levels, but particularly in the lowest. So abundant in sheer bulk 
in this Pearly Bronze Age ware on Tell en-Nasbeh that we must 
assume for that period a long-continued and populous .settlement on 
the hilltop. 

STUDY OF CERAMICS 

During the season just closed we had an especially competent 
.'^taff of 14 members, and consequently were able to give close atten- 
tion to a number of special problems. Four members, trained in the 
study of Palestinian ceramics, gave particular attention to nearly 
3,000 half -bushel baskets of potsherds that were brought down from 
the Tell. One member gave his whole time to the accurate labelling 
of the baskets, and the numbering of rooms, silos, cisterns, and other 
structures. After being brought down to headquarters the pot- 
sherds Avere washed, and examined in detail. Five by eight inch 
cards were used to make notes on the contents of each basket, and 
these were filed according to provenience for future reference or 
further study. In addition, all unusual forms, objects, or decora- 
tions were drawn to scale on 5 by 8 inch millimeter-ruled cards, 
and these were filed with the basket cards. In this manner over 



490 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

2,820 object drawings were added to our files, besides the 768 which 
were recorded in our nniseum book. 

STAMPED JAR HANDLES 

It was probably in part due to this systematic scrutiny of pot- 
sherds that we found during the past season a dozen or more jar 
handle seal inscriptions and graffiti on pottery. Two bear the name 
of the deity in the form of " Yah " or " Yahu." One bears the con- 
sonants MZH, probably referring to the feast of unleavened bread. 
These three seal impressions resemble similar ones found by Sellin 
and Watzinger at Jericho. Still another, very different from the 
last mentioned, bears the consonants MZP, and is, therefore, a com- 
panion piece of the MZP (Mizpah?) stamp found in 1927. There 
are a number of jar handle stamps with a flying eagle and the well- 
known legend " For the King. Hebron." On one impression which 
bears the simple legend " For the King " (le-Melek), the tail feathers 
are so clearly indicated that the stamp maker's intention to represent 
a bird and not a flying scroll can no longer be doubted. The graffiti 
are of some epigraphical importance on account of the forms of the 
Hebrew letters employed, but must be reserved for a separate dis- 
cussion. Practically all the jar handle stamps were found in the 
II and I Iron Age levels. Unless a closer study of our detailed 
records of the ceramic context should oblige me to modify my present 
conclusions, these jar handle inscriptions belong to the period between 
900 and 600 B. C. 

THE NECROPOLIS 

The possible whereabouts of the Tell en-Nasbeh necropolis has for 
the writer been a subject of considerable thought during the past 
three years. There are numerous empty tombs in the rock terraces 
on the slopes of the Tell, but all of them appear, judged by their 
structure, to be isolated tombs of no great age. It seemed clear that 
for so populous a city there must have been a general burial place 
somewhere in the vicinity of the Tell. During the last month of the 
1929 excavations I undertook a systematic search of the ridges and 
slopes contiguous to our city mound, and with most gratifying 
results. On the western slope of a ridge north of the Tell I ob- 
served in the slightly exposed bedrock what seemed to be the remains 
of a much weathered cutting. Removal of the accumulated debris 
soon brought to light a shallow forecourt, chiseled out of the lime- 
stone, and at its east end an upright doorstone was found still in 
place, rabbeted into the stone frame of a tomb entrance. Close to it, 
but on the north side of the sunken forecourt, was a smaller door- 
stone, fitted like a lid into the frame of another opening. (PI. 6.) 



TELL EN-NASBEH EXCAVATIONS — BADE 491 

It was evident tliat this was a tomb of considerable a<?e. On 
removal of the larjrer doorstone the front of the tomb was found to be 
solidly filled with black earth carried in by seepaj^e of water thr()ii«:h 
ill-fitting joints in the doorway. When this earth had been removed 
it was found to be a tomb with a double history. The first burial, 
judjzinn: by the pottery, had been made about 700 B. C. ; the second 
belon^'ed to the Hellenistic period, about 250 B. C, or later. Only a 
part of the debris within the tomb, to«;ether with the .skeletal remains, 
had been removed for the second burial, so that both deposits of 
funerary gifts were substantially preserved. The Hellenistic deposit 
comprised a number of vases and jars which were clearly imitations of 
Cireek forms. One of them was an alabastron. There was also a small 
globular vase of fine thin paste, which is a remarkably faithful repre- 
sentation of a pomegranate. The prominent segmented calyx was 
made to serve as the neck of the vase, and even the scar made by tear- 
ing the fruit from the stem was faithfully imitated. A varied col- 
lection of jewelry, including rings, fibulae, brooches, and ear-rings, 
accompanied the ceramic deposit. (PI. 7.) 

The second and older deposit, dated provisionally near the begin- 
ning of the second phase of the Iron Age (800-586 B. C), was repre- 
.sented by 30 pieces of pottery, among them 11 saucer lamps. Only 
one of them had a slight foot, a fact which, by comparison with 
lamps found in rooms and stratified deposits on the Tell, would tend 
to push back the date of this deposit to the close of the Iron Age I 
(1200-800 B. C). The fact that only a few fragmentary human 
remains were found in the tomb may, as already suggested, be mos< 
plausibly exjilained by the supposition that at the time of the second 
burial the skeletons of the first burial were removed. The contents 
of the small tomb on the left side of the main entrance support this 
view. It seems originally to have been intended for the burial of an 
infant. Having been opened also at the time of the Hellenistic 
burial, and being found too small, some large bones of adults from 
the main tomb were thrust into it before it was closed again. In 
any case there were found in this niche some large bones of an adult 
lying on top of the very slight remains of a child burial. Xo other 
objects furnished any clue to its purpose or past history. 

More difficult is it to account for the almost complete absence of 
skeletal remains in connection with the secondary Hellenistic burial, 
more especially since the door-stones were still in place. Perhaps 
the tomb was robbed a few years after burial. The smallncss of the 
funerary deposit could then be accounted for on the assumption that 
the most valuable objects were removed together with the skeletons, 
or perhaps an o.ssuary containing the bones. The recovery of a smuU 
ornamental bronze handle of some receptacle which was no longer 
in the tomb, favors this explanation. 



492 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

TOMB NUMBER V 

Feeling sure that there were other tombs in the immediate neigh- 
borhood, I liad the thin cover of debris removed from the underly- 
ing rock, and soon we found the opening of another tomb close to 
the f)receding. Its doorstone was gone. A flight of three stone steps 
led down from the small square opening into a central oblong pit 
flanked around the top by passages n.earlj'^ a meter in width. At the 
back was another room whose floor had been sunk to the same depth 
as the pit in front. Both chambers were filled with earth to within 
a foot of the ceiling. When cleared this tomb was found to contain 
an astonishing amount of pottery of the Early Iron Age (1200- 
800 B. C.) and is, therefore, contemporaneous with the earlier period 
of Old Testament history. Two scarabs, found with the pottery, 
will be submitted to expert Egyptologists, for they may furnish a 
more definite date for the burial deposit. 

The tomb has yielded 183 museum objects, besides much other 
material for historical study. One curious terra-cotta bottle jar, so 
far as known, is unique. It simulates, with incised spirals, a bee- 
hive built up in a blunt cone by means of coiled ropes of straw. A 
spirally incised bottle neck on the side makes the doorway for the 
bees. Inside of the jar was found a waxlike deposit which, on chemi- 
cal examination, may confirm the plausible supposition that it was 
used to provide a food offering of honey for the dead. (Deut. 26 : 14.) 

Another piece of pottery suggests a swan. The long curved 
neck is surmounted by a pitcher mouth with laterally pinched lips 
simulating a mandible. On top, or in other words on the back, are 
painted in red and black bands the outlines of wings. This object 
may have come from Cyprus or may be a local imitation of Cypriote 
art. Among the scores of other vessels are amphoras, bottle jugs, 
pitchers, saucers, chalices, an incense burner, and other forms hard 
to describe. There were scores of small black juglets which probably 
contained oil or some other substance deemed important to the dead. 
Equally numerous were the saucer lamps, and not one of them had 
even the suggestion of a foot. Among 30, bowls of various sizes and 
forms there were some that had been, pebble burnished over a deep 
red slip. 

After clearing these two tombs I once more examined the sur- 
roundings on the slope where they were situated, and became fully 
convinced that we had found the Tell en-Nasbeh necropolis, the city 
of the dead. The only question on which we needed further light 
was the length of the historical period during which burials had 
been made here. The two tombs already cleared covered the period 
from the Early Iron Age to the Hellenistic period, 1200 to 250 B. C. 
Was the slope also used for burials during the Bronze Age? Not

more than 40 feet away from the ahove-mentioncd tombs I found on 
the surface a fragment of a ledt^e handle which seemed to answer my 
question aftirmatively. 

LAST lloru DlSCfJVERIES 

'J\) «rain. if possible, more certainty on (liis ])oin(. I directed an 
Eirv])ti:ni foreman and two local workmen (o siid< a shaft where (he 
telltale ledjxe handle frafrment was found, and before lonj; we had 
other ledce handles and a basketful of Early Bronze Age ware of 
the kind found in our deepest level on the Tell. The excavation 
sewn openetl tlie broken-down remains of a typical Early Bronze Ajje 
cave tomb, and a passage leading away from it into bedrock beyond, 
may be the approach to one that is still undisturbed. But we were 
too close to the date agreed ui^on with the department of antiquities 
for the division of the season's finds to risk the opening of another 
tomb. Our whole stalf. working at the utmost pressure, could 
scarcely hope to complete, in the time remaining, the drawing, 
photographing, and recording of the objects which already covered 
all our taides and slielvos at headquarters. So I reluctantly gave 
directions to wall up the underground passage and fdl up the shaft 
in expectation of a time when we may return to delve still further 
into the historical secrets of that rocky and weather-beaten hillside. 

The same pressure for time and space compelled us to halt on 
the brink of interesting revelations in the excavations on the Tell 
itself. At the farthest edge of the last strip excavated, we opened 
on the inner edge of the city wall a vaulted ])assage and a long flight 
of stone steps leading down into — what? Around the entrance 
were house foundations of the Maccabaean period, and house walls 
running out upon the city wall during a long time after the last 
walled city had ceased to exist. Two Hellenistic lamps and a coin 
found in the descending passage .suggest that the Maccabees were 
its builders, and certainly the last who used it. "When fully excavated 
it was found to end in an underground cave or grotto. In the center 
was the mouth of a rock-hewn cistern carefully covered with flat 
.stones, a bit of thoughtfulness which .<^hows that those who did it 
had no expectation of leaving it forever as they walked up the long 
flight of steps 2.000 years ago. 

A peep into the depths of the cistern showed a small cone of 
loose debris rising above the washed-in sediment at the bottom. 
Its connection with the Maccabaean level, and the fact of its being 
underground, made me eager to excavate the ci.stern. A week might 
have sufficed to extract and record the secrets of its past. But we 
had no week to spare. So we had to content ourselves with photo- 
graphs and drawings of the externals. ITnder my direction the

workmen then built a wall across the passage to the grotto and 
spread a deep blanket of earth over the top. 

A GRAECO-ROMAN TOMB 

In conclusion, we must recur once more to what we shall now 
call the North Cemetery. In the immediate vicinity of the Iron Age 
Tombs III and V, I had observed partly collapsed and weathered- 
out tombs, whose surface appearance indicated that they belonged 
to the Hellenistic or even to a later period. One of these, the best 
preserved, had a covered forecourt about 6 feet square, and not quite 
6 feet high. It had been hewn from a ledge of limestone. The 
whole of the west side was open to the weather. The smooth vertical 
wall of the east end was pierced at the floor level by a small square 
opening scarcely large enough to admit a man. Both the forecourt 
and the entrance were choked with rocks and soil to such an extent 
that no animal larger than a fox could have entered the tomb. After 
this had been cleared away, it could be seen that the tomb itself was 
filled with debris nearly to the top. 

On consulting the Arab owner of the land on which the tomb 
was located, he told me that it had been opened by an Arab purveyor 
of antiquities just before the war, that he employed only one assist- 
ant, and that he felt sure the tomb had not been entirely cleared. It 
was, indeed, still largely filled with washed-in debris. Desiring to 
ascertain, if possible, the age of the tomb, I directed one of our 
Egyptian gang leaders to clear it and two women carriers to sift 
the materials for small objects. "We were not disappointed. Very 
soon a coin of Herod Archelaus came to light. This Archelaus, who 
ruled from 4 B. C. to G A. D., is the one mentioned in Matthew 2 : 22. 
He was a cruel ruler, and committed many outrages upon the Jews. 
The latter denounced him so bitterly at Rome that he was cited by 
the Emperor Augustus to appear before him. Unable to justify 
himself, he was banished to Vienna in Gaul in the year 6 A. D. The 
tomb, therefore, belongs approximately to the beginning of the 
Christian era. Remains of beads, jewelry, seals, lamps, and other 
objects recovered are also appropriate to this period, and are of 
special historical interest, on account of their chronological coinci- 
dence with the boyhood of Jesus of Nazareth.

A little moro than a year aj^o, "roolofrii^ts and «^la('ioloj;i.sts were 
celebratin<:^ the one hundiodth anniversary of the birth of ghiciology 
as a science. The year 1930 might well be chosen as the one 
hundredth anniversary of the birth of jirehistory as a science, since 
it was in 1830 that Thonisen of Copenhagen applied his new system 
of prehistoric chronology to the Danish National Museum collec- 
tions. There is something back of the fact that these anniversaries 
come so nearly coinciding. Progress in glaciology has meant much 
toward progress in prehistory. Chronologically speaking, the Ice 
Age falls within the limits of prehistoric time and the precision 
of our knowledge concerning glacial and intorglacial chronology 
helps us to date many of the prehistoric relics inseparably linked 
with Ice Age deposits and fauna. In the past few years, much 
progress has been made in this field of reseai'ch. In our summary 
then of recent progress in Old World prehistory let us first see what 
has been done in the way of correlating Ice Age with prehistoric 
chronology. 

Correlation of Ice Age and prehistoric chronology. — For years 
the general consensus of opinion was that the last phase of Mous- 
terian culture was coincident with the advance of tiie Wiirm or last 
glaciation and that Upper Paleolithic (Aurignacian, Solutrean, and 
Magdalonian) was coincident with a part of the maxinuim Wiirm 
ghuiation and the major part of its retreat. Lentil very reiently 
conservative prehistorians attempted to compress practically all of 
the Lower Paleolithic into the last interglacial epoch (Riss-Wiirm). 
In 1JU2, Conniiont had come to the conclusion that at least an early 
phase of the Chellean (Pre-Chellean) should be placed in the next 
to the last (Mindcl-Riss) interglacial. 

The recent progress in this direction is due largely to .). Keid 
Moir and the Abbe H. Breuil. The main points in Breuii's syn-

Egypt. — A fairly complete story of the Stone Age in Egypt is 
slowly taking shape due to the researches of Miss G. Caton-Thomp- 
son and Miss E. W. Gardner and more recently to those undertaken 
by the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago, with K. S. Sandford 
and W. J. Arkell in charge. 

The Study of Nile-Faiyum Divide during Pliocene and Pleisto- 
cene Times by Sandford and Arkell appeared in 1929 as Volume X 
of the Oriental Institute Publications.- 

In Upper Egypt they have identified a series of four river terraces 
in which Lower and Middle Paleolithic implements occur in situ 
as follows: 

Height above Nile Cultures 

3 meters (10 feet) Mousterian. 

9 meters (30 feet) Early Mousterian. 

15 meters (50 feet) Acheulian. 

30 meters (100 feet) Chellean.

OU) WORLD PREHISTORY — MacC'URDY 497 

These have been traced over some hundertls of miles on both sides 
of the Nile and in ailjoining deserts between Assuan and Assiut. 

In Lower Ejrypt, between the Faiyum and Cairo, the series is not 
so complete. Tlius far no representative of the 30-meter terrace has 
been discovered, but an old Nile channel at an elevation of 2(>-21 
meters has yielded waterwurn (tierived) ("helleun and fresh Acheu- 
lian implements. The Mousterian terrace in Lower Kj^ypt has been 
traced through the Hawara Channel and into the Faiyum. The 
evidence shows that in Mousterian times the Faiyum w^as occupied by 
a vast lake fed by the 2sile. 

The Faiyum Basin is an integral part o'f the Nile system; not 
a tributary system as once supposed, but an overflow reservoir into 
whicii the Nile discharged its surplus water. In Paleolithic times 
this Faiyum lake was full. The surface of the lake then stood at 
34.*J m. (liii feet) above sea level. There was an annual flood and 
annual low Nile in Paleolithic times as there is to-day. Now the 
annual Nile flood reaches Cairo in late summer. Thus it may have 
been the early autunmal gales that swept from the west across the 
Faiyum Lake, then at high level, which produced the storm beach 
some 10 feet (3.05 m.) high along the eastern shore of the lake. 
Strong westerly autunmal gales still sweep across the Faiyum 
Basin: but on the shores of the shrunken survivor of the old lake 
now hidden far below sea level, they produce a storm beach barely 
a foot high (30 cm.). 

Along the eastern shore of the old Faiyum Lake a short distance 
south of the Philadelphia ruins, there are important imi)lement- 
bearing deposits. The site is at Gebel cr-llus, the implements are 
of Mousterian age and the elevation is 34 m. (115.5 feet) above sea 
level. The richest site thus far discovered in the Faiyum is on the 
beach at Kasr Basil near Tutun on the southern shore of the old 
lake and at an elevation of 34.2 m. (112 feet). There is a basal 
pebble bed with Mousterian implements on which is superposed a 
silt deposit in turn covered by gravel, both containing Mousterian 
implements. The cores or nuclei as well as the finished tools re- 
semble those found in Mousterian stations of western Europe. The 
cores vary from elongated to siiuarish (" double-ended ") and 
discoid forms. The material employed was of flint or chert. 

In the kitchen middens and the silts associated with them in the 
Kom Ombo plain, between Edfu and Assuan, E. Vignard has found 
an industry which seems to have evolved locally from the Mousterian, 
but wliich in time ceased to be recognizable as Mousterian, owing to 
an accumulation of modifica-tions and the growth of new types. To 
the modified indigenous industry Vignard has given the name Sebi- 
lian. He divides it into three phases: Sebilian I, 11, and IIL The 
Mousterian disk persists in Sebilian T. The ndcrolithic flakes and 



498 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

implements of geometric design in Sebilian III are comparable in 
technique with the Tardenoisian industry and may be of the same 
age. 

Sandford and Arkell find that the Sebilian industry described 
by Vignard is not confined to the Kom Ombo plain. They find it 
on both sides of the Hawara Channel, especially at Kon Medinet, 
Ghurab and Dimishkin, in silt and fine gravel. Within the Faiyum, 
the gravel banks flanking the Hawara Channel spread out into a 
second system of beaches, storm beaches and shoals closely resembling 
those associated w4th the lake of Mousterian times. Tlie water in 
the lake during the Late Paleolithic or Sebilian times stood at 28 m. 
(92 feet) above sea level, or G.l m. (20 feet) below its elevation in 
Mousterian times. An exceptional!}^ prolific Sebilian site was found 
on the shore of this late Paleolithic lake near Philadelphia. The 
beach of this old lake is a prominent feature in the great bay of 
Philadelphia and the greater part of the Greco-Roman town was 
built upon and just behind it. In an obscure corner of the Faiyum 
Basin between Shakluf Bridge and Kasr Basil, Sandford and Arkell 
were so fortunate as to find no less than 10 beaches left by the falling 
lake as the climate became progressively more arid. 

The industry of Late Paleolithic or Sebilian age found at the 
28 m. (92 feet) beach level is of surprising uniformity. The cores 
are miniatures of the Mousterian cores. The flakes fall into two 
classes: (a) Miniatures of the Mousterian flake and (h) thin broad 
flakes with straight parallel margins. Most of the microlithic 
Sebilian types of Upper Egypt still remain to be discovered in Lower 
Egypt. 

The field work of Sanford and Arkell terminated with the 22.5 
m. (74 feet) level. However they agree with Miss G. Caton-Thomp- 
son and Miss E. W. Gardner that the 22.5 m. (74 feet) lake was suc- 
ceeded by a Neolithic lake at a level of 17.4 m. (57 feet) ; that these 
two successive lakes were separated b}^ a long interval of time, dur- 
ing which the Faiyum Basin was drained and the old lake deposits 
were deeply eroded before the water rose again to the 17.4 m. (57 
feet) level, decadent Neolithic industries being associated with it 
down to 2.1 m. (7 feet) below sea level; that it has since continued to 
sink until the present day, when its surface lies 44.8 m. (147 feet) 
below sea level and only 5.5 m. (18 feet) above the bottom of the 
deepest part ; that the last stage of contraction has been accompanied 
by a sudden increase in salinity, which has killed most of the fresh- 
water fauna, two marine bivalves taking its place. Desert condi- 
tions were apparently established in -Upper Egypt as early as 
Sebilian times, and at a later date as one proceeds northward, north 
of the latitude of the Faiyum, they may not have become absolute 
until post-Neolithic times.

Mesopotamia. — TIuto is evt'iv icason to hclievi' that records sim- 
ilar to those reported from llic Upper Nile Valley will be found in 
the upper stretches of the Kuphiates and Ti<rris Valleys. In fact, 
Passenianl has reported the Hndinj,' of a Chellean hand ax from the 
gravels at the hasc of the .'U)-meter terrace, right bank of the Eu- 
phrates between Kakka and Deir ez Zor, Syria. In type anil patina 
it is exactly like those foiind in the Thames Valley at Milton Street 
and in the Sonune Valley. Passemaril also points out that in the 
Enplirates Valley one finds a system of terraces at four levels — 15, 
;i(), CiO, and 100 meters respectively — comparable with the four ter- 
races to be found in the river valleys of western Europe. 

France. — Even older than the Chellean of the 30-meter terraces 
in the valleys of the Nile and the Euphrates are the crude artifacts 
found by Peyrony only last summer in the basal deposits of the sta- 
tion known as La Micoque, near Les Eyzies (Dordoirne). The site 
has been known for at least 35 years, bef2;inninLr with the excava- 
tions of Chauvet ami Kiviere. Many prehistorians have since clone 
at least some work on this spot. All were a<:reed as to the rela- 
tively great antiqinty of the deposits, dating back at least to the 
Acheulian Epoch. P]ach stopped at a thick sterile deposit supposed 
to underlie the oldest relic-bearing level. It remained for Peyrony 
to hazaril a sounding deeper than all the others. lie was rewarded 
by finding a basal relic-bearing deposit far below the lowest hitherto 
known. The artifacts are eolithic in type and are referred by Pey- 
\\m\ to the Pre-Chellean Epoch (Lower Pleistocene). Pej'rony 
has also just added another page to our knowledge of another site 
in the Dordogne — the type station of Le Moustier. The oldest relic- 
bearing level hitherto known at Le Moustier belongs to the Mous- 
terian Epoch. Beneath this is a thick sterile deposit beneath which 
Peyrony has found an additional relic-bearing deposit. IJut the 
cultural remains are of a type similar to those in the level above. 
Peyrony's successful soundings at La Micoque and Le Moustier 
should serve as a reminder to all exca\ators to be sure they are at 
the bottom of a section as soon as possible after their work is begun. 

By combining four rock shelters in the Dordogne — La Micoque, 
Le Moustier, Laugerie-IIaute, and Laugerie-Basse — it is now pos- 
sible to build U[) a composite section representing the entire gamut 
of Stone Age cultures from the pre-Chellean to the Neolithic, 
inclusive. 

Chou Kou Tien. — The year li>iiU will com|)are favorably with any 
single year, in the past one hundred, in respect to pnliistoiic achieve- 
ment. The discovery of an almost complete skull of an early type of 
man at Chou Kou Tien southwest of Peiping (Peking), China, is per- 
haps the outstanding event of the year (pis. 1-3) . The first discovery 
of hominid remains at Chou Kou Tien was some four years ago. 



500 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

From 1923 to 1926 tliore were recovered two human teeth from 
material that had been previously taken from the Chou Kou Tien 
deposit — a rip:ht upper molar and a lower first premolar. In October 
of the following year Doctor Bohlin found a left lower permanent 
molar (probably the first) of a child. 

During the season of 1928 there were found in the same deposit 
(Locus A) tlie right horizontal ramus of an adult human lower 
jaw with three molar teeth in situ and leaving the premolar, canine, 
and distal half of the lateral incisor soclcets preserved; a some- 
what worn right upper molar (M 1 or M 2) showing definite evi- 
dence of injury during life; the labial side of the crown and 
portion of the root of a permanent upper median incisor and imma- 
ture lower (?) permanent incisor; and lastly the labial half of the 
crown and root of a worn lower median permanent incisor, post- 
humously crushed and deformed. The specimens are deeply pig- 
mented and mineralized in a manner characteristic of all fossils 
recovered from locus A. 

The fossils from Locus B of the same Chou Kou Tien deposit 
are not deeply pigmented, most of them being quite white or of 
light buff color. They are imbedded in a hard yellowish travertine. 
Not much of the hominid material has as yet been disengaged from 
the travertine matrix, enough, however, to prove that the hominid 
material from both loci belong to the same genus and species, to 
which Dr. Davidson Black has given the name Sinanthropus 'pekin- 
ensis. The specimens thus far disengaged include a score or more 
of both deciduous and permanent teeth representing many phases of 
wear and age, together with complete symphysis region of the lower 
jaw of a very young individual; other specimens are alreadjT^ visible 
in the matrix. 

In December, 1929, while excavating a sheltered recess of the 
main deposit at Chou Kou Tien, Mr. W. C. Pei discovered the 
greater part of an adult hominid cranium in a good state of preser- 
vation (not even crushed). Within the main cave deposit at Chou 
Kou Tien up to the present time Sinanthropus remains have been 
recovered from five different loci, three of which, including the 
last major find, have been discovered by Mr. Pei during the last 
season's work. Contrary to any reports Mdiich have been circulated, 
no skeletal parts other than the skull and numerous isolated teeth 
have been recovered during the past year's excavations. 

It should be noted that the different Sinanthropus loci discovered 
within the main Chou Kou Tien deposit are all clearly contempo- 
raneous with one another, being Lower Quaternary (Polycene) in 
age. This latter statement is based on the evidence collected in a 
preliminary report on the geology and paleontology of the site by

OLD WORLD PREHISTORY — MacCURDY 501 

Pere Teilhtird tie Chardin iiiul Dr. C. C. Young, just i.ssui'd fioni 
the press. Further it should be added that up to the present time, 
though thousands of cubic meters of material have been examined, 
no artifacts of any nature have been encountered nor lias any trace 
of the usage of (ire been observed. 

The greater part of the left lateral surface and the fore part of 
the base of this unique skull of /Sinanthropus is still imbedded in a 
block of very hard travertine.- The vault of the skull, from its 
massive brow ridges to the occiput, and the whole right side of the 
specimen was, however, supported within a relatively soft matrix 
which has now been removed. In the present stage of its prepara- 
tion it thus becomes apparent that the brain case has been almost 
completely i)reserved while most of the facial region is lacking. 
Black says the cranium is that of a young adult female. 

The skull of Sinanthropus is approximately similar in length to 
that of Pithecaiithropiu^ and like the latter form is provided with 
massive brow ridges, a feature to be correlated with a powerful jaw 
mechanism. ILnvevcr, Shianthropus characteristically differs from 
the Java type in the following important features: Kelatively well- 
developed frontal eminences, well-localized parietal eminences and 
greater height of skull vault, all these characters pointing to a rela- 
tively greater brain capacity in /Sinunthrojm-s.^ The mastoid proc- 
CS.SCS of Sinunthropus are small. The sockets in which the lower jaw 
articulated are well preserved on both sides, a circumstance which 
will be of great value in the restoration of the lower jaw fragments 
recovered in 1928. 

In July, 1930, Dr. Davidson Black announced the discovery at 
Chou Kou Tien (Locus D) of the greater part of the vault and a por- 
tion of the base of a second Sinanthropus cranium (pi. 4). He be- 
lieves it to be that of a young though fully adult individual, probably 
a male. The new specimen has been pieced together from fragments, 
the broken edges of which fit one another; no other restoration being 
resorted to in order to produce the results as seen in Plate 4. 

This cranium, the second to be found at Chou Kou Tien, yields 
valuable information concerning certain parts not represented in the 
first more perfectly preserved specimen. Compared with the latter, 
according to Black, the new cranium also presents certain slight 
differences which may be due to a difference in sex. While the new 
cranium has about the same maxinunn transverse diameter as the 
lirst, its length is greater than the latter by some two centimeters. 
On the other hand the frontal eminences are not so prominent, nor 
is the average thickness of the skull vault so great in the second as

in the first specimen. A small part of the left glenoid fossa has been 
preserved, also the nasal suture and the base of the broad nasal 
bones. 

Saccopastore. — The estate of Saccopastore is about 3.5 km. (2.2 
miles) from the Porta Pia, Rome. Here in a gravel pit workmen 
discovered a skull of the Neandertal type in 1929. It was immedi- 
ately turned over by the lessee of the estate, Signor Casorri, to the 
Duke of Grazioli, who confided it to the Anthropological Institute 
of the University of Rome, where it will be preserved. According 
to Prof. Sergio Sergi, the mandible is lacking but the cranium is in 
a fairly good state of preservation. 

The cranium is characterized by the relatively large facial in con- 
trast with the cerebral portion, as well as the high degree of progna- 
thism and the depression of the vault. The cranial capacity is not 
over 1,200 cc. and the cranium is that of a female. The remaining 
teeth, five molars and a premolar, are large. The orbital apertures 
are very large; the piriform aperture is low and large. The anterior 
projection of the nasal processes and of the body surface of the 
maxilla form a kind of snout, not met with in any other known type. 

The cranium came from a depth of 6 m. (19.6 feet) in a stratum of 
sand and gravel, rich in fossil animal remains: Elefhas antiquus, 
Hippopotamus 7najor, Rhinoceros iiiercki^ Cervvs elnphus^ Bos primi- 
ffenius, and others. No artifacts have been found at Saccopastore, 
but artifacts of the Mousterian type were found in the same strata of 
near-by sites in the valley of the Tevere and Aniene as early as 1846. 
These finds with that of the cranium are proof that man lived in 
Lazio probabl}^ as early as the Riss-Wiirm interglacial epoch. 

Czechoslovakia. — There are many sand pits and brickyards within 
and near the city limits of Brno. These are watched continuously 
for prehistoric relics. In May, 1927, a human skeleton was found in 
the exploitation in Susilova Street, Zabovresky quarter of the greater 
city. The skeleton was found in a red sandy loam at the contact 
between the sand and the coarse gravel at a depth of 2.15 m. (7 feet). 
It lay in a crouching position in a kind of egg-shaped hollow. The 
color of the sandy loam about it was deep red. Since the color 
diminished in intensity radially in all directions from the skeleton, 
the coloring matter must have been originally a part of the burial. 
The skeleton, which was in a bad state of preservation, is that of an 
adult woman and is referred to as Brno III. According to Matiegka, 
the skull bears the strongest resemblance to the skulls from Combe- 
Capelle and Mladec I; also in certain features to Brno II and the 
female skulls from Predmost. 

An additional fossil human- skeleton was found at Predmost in 
1928. The skeleton, in a fragmentary condition, was found in ashes 
of the Paleolithic layer, associated with bones of the mammoth. 



OLD WORLD PitEHISTOllY — MacCURDY 603 

The proximal end of the left human femur is missing. On the re- 
maining two-thirds, there are scrapings and cuts oblique to tlie axis 
of the shaft on its anterior surface all the way up from the lateral 
condyle. They were done by tlint tools and raise the question as to 
whether cannibalism was practiced at Predmost. In all, r)4 bones 
of the human skeleton were found, at the same level and not far 
removed from the remarkable communal grave discovered by Maska. 
Our knowledge of the fossil fauna associated with fossil man is 
growing apace. One of these animals was the woolly rhinoceros 
(Rhinoceros tichorhlniis) which sometimes served as a model for 
Cro-Magnon artists. It was a contemporary of the woolly elephant 
{hlrphas prim i genius). Well preserved examples of both have been 
found in Siberian ice fields. In 1907 asphaltum deposits at Starunia, 
l*oland, yielded a mammoth (woolly elephant) and woolly rhinoc- 
eros, both perfectly ])rcserved. They are now in the museum at 
Lemberg. In 1929, from the same deposit there was taken another 
complete woolly rhinoceros, which has been removed to the museum 
of the Polish Academy of Science in Krakau. 

Cave art. — The latest researches of Pittard tend to prove that the 
first example of cave art to be discovered was not the engraving on 
bone from Chaffaud, but an engraved baton of reindeer horn from 
the cavern of Le Veyrier, near Geneva (Llaute-Savoie). This baton 
was found by Franc^^ois Mayor in 18153 and reported the same year 
to the Societe de Physique et d'Histoire Naturelle, Geneva. The en- 
graving is not an important work of art. It would be difiicult to 
determine the animal intended to be represented. Mayor also found 
that which at first glance would seem to be a harpoon. But the 
point is at the wrong end; so that instead of being a harpoon shaft 
with i)arbs. the piece represents a stem in bud. Thus the first en- 
graved object and the first sculptured object dating from the cave- 
s' rt era were both found at Le Veyrier — on Frencli soil, to be sure, 
but by a Genevese. 

A number of outstanding discoveries in the field of Paleolithic art 
have been made during the past few years, some of which have not 
yet been published. I shall mention briefly six of these — one each 
from Siberia, Italy, England, and Germany and two from France. 
IrkutHk. — A human female figurine has been found on the Bjelala 
River near Irkutsk, Siberia. The site is not far from the Chinese 
frontier. In the same deposits were found fossil bones of the mam- 
moth and woolly rhinoceros. The ligui-ine is of the Brassempouy- 
Willendorf type. The distance from Brassempouy near the Bay of 
Biscay to Irkutsk is about 11.200 km. (7,000 miles). 

Savignano. — A human female figurine was encountered when dig- 
ging a cellar in 192G at Savignano-sul-Panaro (Emilia), Italy. It is 
of the Brassempouy-Grimaldi type and made of steatite. The head 



504 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

is not differentiated, the feet and arms are not represented, the legs 
are fused, while the breasts, hips, and ceinture are overemphasized. 
The figurine is 22.5 cm. in length. 

Petersfels. — Petersfels is the ninth prehistoric station in Germany, 
where Paleolithic art has been found. It is named for Herr Peters, 
the discoverer. The site is near Engen (Hegau), southern Baden, 
only a short distance north of Kesslerloch in Switzerland, which 
many years ago yielded the well-known figure of the browsing rein- 
deer. The find includes stone artifacts, bone needles, perforated 
shells, and teeth, javelin points, batons of reindeer horn, decorated 
ivory disk, pendants representing the human female form carved 
from lignite; also engravings on bone and reindeer horn, including 
figures of the reindeer on a baton. The female figurines are per- 
forated for suspension and are of the Brassempouy-Willendorf type ; 
the head is no longer recognizable, the legs barely indicated and the 
hips exaggerated. Petersfels belongs to a single phase of the Lower 
Magdalenian Epoch. 

Peyrony reports the finding in the cave of La Roche, near Lalinde 
(Dordogne), of stones with engraved figures similar in stylistic pat- 
tern to the lignite statuettes from Petersfels. The engraved figures 
from La Roche and the figurines from Petersfels belong to the Lower 
Magdalenian Epoch ; so that they would be contemporaneous with 
the so-called venus impudique, a figurine found years ago in the rock 
shelter of Laugerie-Basse. The specimen from Laugerie-Basse, while 
more easily recognizable as representing the human female form, 
retains nevertheless characters which link it with the examples from 
Petersfels and La Roche. 

The cave of La Roche has yielded something entirely new in 
paleolithic annals: An oblong object made of reindeer horn, and 
pointed at both ends, one of which is perforated. One face of this 
object bears a pattern composed of parallel series of incised lines, 
some groups being longitudinal and some transverse. This piece 
had been entirely covered by a coating of red ochre prior to the exe- 
cution of the incised decoration; it bears a close resemblance to the 
" churinga " of the Arunta Tribe in Australia and must in its time 
have served a purpose similar to that served by the esoteric and 
sacred churinga. 

Trois-Freres. — In addition to the long series of mural figures dis- 
covered at Trois-Freres, recent excavations have yielded remarkable 
examples of portable art. These finds were made in floor deposits 
not far from the Enlene entrance, by Mons. Louis Begouen. They 
include a plaque of ivory on which are engraved figures of two cats 
seen from the back, also a cricket in profile. Another example is a 
baton of reindeer horn with engraved figure of a bison. Perhaps 



OLD WORLD PREHISTORY — MacCURDY 505 

tlie rarest of all is the head of a wild <j;oat carvcil fioiu rriiidcer 
horn with inlay eyes of another material (Iturnt bone). 

In the summer of iy*2U Mons. Be«;ouen found still another example 
of Paleolithic inlay. It is on the base of a dart thrower, of which 
the crochet is formed by a bird's beak. On one face of the shaft 
of the dart thrower there is engraved a goose, the neck bent; on the 
opposite face the same bird is sculptured in high relief, the head 
turned backwartl. The eye is represented by a deep pit in wliich 
there was originally an inlay. 

Le Roc. — The station of Le Roc is situated on a small aflluent of 
the Echelle, in the commune of Sers, some 15 km. southeast of 
Angouleme (Charente). It consists of two caves — Grotte du Hoc 
and Grotte de la Vierge — between which is a workshop where the 
sculptured frieze was found. In addition to the sculptured frieze, 
engraved figures on limestone were found as follows: Bison and cave 
bear (on the same piece) from below the Grotte de la Vierge and 
a horse from the same trench; a third example is the figure of a bison. 

Tlie frieze, which is now installed in the Salle Henri Martin at 
Saint-Germain-en-Laye, is sculptured on a series of five stones. 
When found these stones were turned with their ornamented faces 
against the archeological deposit. As reconstructed, the series from 
left to right is as follows : First stone, at left, masked man ( ?), center 
two horses, right musk ox charging a hunter; second stone, horse fac- 
ing left; third stone, horse facing right; fourth stone (beneath the 
third), horse facing right; fifth stone, horse and pseudo-bovidae 
both facing right. 

El Pendo. — The first example of cave art ever discovered was an 
object of the type later known as baton de commanilement. The 
baton is a piece of reindeer horn or stag horn with one or more 
perforations and usually decorated. Paleolithic batons have been 
found sjjaringly in Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, England, Ger- 
many, Italy, Poland, Siberia, and Switzerland. Several dozen have 
been reported from France, and nine from Spain. The latest one 
from Spain was unearthed in the cave of El Pendo (Santander) by 
the Don Jesus Carballo and is preserved in the Museo Prehistorico, 
Santander. From the viewpoint of art and symbolism, this specimen 
ranks among the most important. It is of stag horn with a perfora- 
tion near one end. The entire superficies is practically covered by a 
series of admiral)!}' incised animal heads: Four of Cei'vus eJaphus 
(one stag and three hinds) and one of the horse. These are accom- 
panied by groups of incised lines, some in parallel and some X shaped. 
This baton furnishes added evidence that the cave artist showed a 
preference for the female of the species. The three heads of tiie hind 
exhibit the same technique as does the hind's head on the baton from 



506 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

Valle (Santander). The baton from El Pendo was found in the 
Upper Magdalenian level. 

Creswell Crags. — From England, poor in Paleolithic art, Leslie 
Armstrong reports the finding in a proto-Solutrean horizon of one 
of the eaves at Creswell Crags (Derbyshire) the figure of a man 
Avearing an animal mask, engraved on reindeer bone. 

Jordansviilhl. — I can not close this report of progress without 
mention of at least a few recent discoveries of post-Paleolithic date. 
There have been many, out of which Jordansmiihl (Silesia) should 
be first considered. The name is well known in prehistory through 
discoveries made at the Neolithic and Chalcolithic camp site on 
Bischkowitz hill. In the vicinity of Jordansmiihl (west side) are a 
number of sites dating from the Bronze and Iron Ages, as well as 
from the Neolithic. 

The Jordansmiihl ceramic type is distinct from all others. The 
paste is free from coarse material, the walls of the vessels are thick. 
The color is dark brown to iron gray. Other types than the Jor- 
dansmiihl are found in the vicinity. 

In 1925 a clay figure of a ram was found in a sand pit on the 
Klose farm west of Jordansmiihl. With it were two clay vessels 
and a broken flint knife. Although somewhat weathered the figure 
of the ram has been restored. Its total height is 33 cm., body height 
23.5 cm., and length 37 cm. The rugosity of the massive horns is 
well represented by means of transverse string imprints. The neck 
and body also bear string imprints. This is a splendid example in 
clay pf the Neolithic potter's art. 

Neolithic art in China. — The East India Museum of Stockholm 
has recently come into possession of a ceramic piece dating from 
the Neolithic Period in China, which is of more than passing interest. 
It is the lid of a vessel in the form of a human head, neck, and bust. 
The facial region rises slightly from the spherical head. The chin, 
nose, and cheek protuberances are perforated; the eyes and mouth 
are simply oval holes. The brows are prominent. Above and back 
of the brows there is a pair of pitted protuberances. Beginning 
at the crown and meandering gracefully down the back of the head 
and neck onto the bust there is a figure suggesting a Chinese pigtail, 
but instead it is a serpent, the head (with open mouth) of which 
rises above the pair of protuberances. Nothing like this has been 
found in western Asia or southeastern Europe. 

Iberian ceramic art. — An idea of the excellence of the potter's 
art in the Iberian Peninsula some 400 B. C. may be had from a 
study of the Heiss collection, recently published in part by Hugo 
Obermaier and Carl Walter Heiss. The necropolis from which this 
collection came is in the region of Archena (Prov. Murcia), south- 
eastern Spain. The paste is a fine reddish yellow clay, the orna- 



OLD WORLD PREHISTORY — MacCURDY 507 

ment in two colors. A description of one of the vases will suffice 
to give a fair idea of the <;roup as a whole. The horizontal bands 
dividing the vase into zones are reddish brown, whereas the zonal 
decorations are in red. The principal panel (at the shoulder) car- 
ries on one side a binl with outstretched wings, on the other a 
carnivore witli open mouth revealing teetli and tongue. Beneatli 
the bird on one side and the carnivore on the other there are in 
each case a lone elevated bird's wing and a fish. The rest of the 
ground in each panel is appropriately decorated with plantlike 
motives. Of the other narrower zones, the middle one is filled by 
means of a series of S-shaj>ed figures, while each of the two zones 
below carries a series of concentric half circles. The vase has a 
j)air of vertically placed handles on the .'^boulder sei)arating the two 
panels of the principal zone. The ceramic art of xVrchena is in all 
respects similar to that in the neighboring region of Elche. 

Iraq and Palestine. — In closing this account of progress, it is 
fitting that mention be made of the work being carried on by the 
American School of Prelnstoric Research, especially that in coopera- 
tion with the British in Iraq and Palestine. The first joint expedi- 
tion wtis in that part of the hill country of southern Kurdistan now 
included in the Kingdom of Iraq. This region is called Sulaiinani 
and the town of Sulaimani, which lies 265 km. northeast of Bagdad 
and 45 km. west of the Persian border, has sometimes been called 
the capital of Southern Kurdistan. Nearly eight weeks in the au- 
tumn of 1928 were devoted to reconnaissance and digging. 

The cave of 2^rzi, 50 km. northwest of Sulaimani, was completely 
excavated. (PI. 5.) The chief culture-bearing level at Zarzi is Upper 
Paleolithic, the equivalent of the Upper Aurignacian at such stations 
in Europe as Willendorf and Krems in lower Austria and the caves 
of Grimaldi in Italy. (PI. 6.) At the top of this level there were 
found true Tardenoisian types of the Mesolithic Period. Tlic layer 
directly above this was mixed and yielded crude pottery as well as 
flint implements similar to those found below. 

Work was continued at the caves of Hazar INIerd. about S km. 
southwest of Sulaimani. One of these — the Dark Cave (Ashkot-i- 
Tarik) — was partially excavated. (PI. 7.) Here three levels were 
encountered in the floor deposits, the sequence from above down- 
wards being: (a) Bronze Age to recent, (6) Upper Paleolithic (simi- 
lar to that at Zarzi), {c) Mousterian. 

Miss Dorothy A. E. Garrod, representing the Percy Sladen Memo- 
rial Fund, was in charge of the expedition. Her report * has just 
been published in bulletin Xo. of the American School of Prehis- 
toric Research (New Haven, Conn., March, 1930).

For three months during the spring of 1929, the American School 
of Prehistoric Research and the British School of Archaeology at 
Jerusalem made soundings in three caves at Jebba near Athlit, 
Palestine — Mugharet el Wad (Cave of the Valley), Oven Cave and 
Cave of the Kid — and partially excavated one, the Mugharet el Wad. 
The locality is 16 km. south of Haifa and less than 5 km. inland from 
the Mediterranean shore. 

Mugharet el Wad proved to be a very rich site, containing also a 
more complete series of culture levels than any other site thus far 
discovered in Palestine. (PI. 8.) Beginning with the Mousterian 
Epoch, the cave was occupied almost continuously down to the pres- 
ent. The sequence from the top downward is as follows: 

7. Mixed layer with remains of Arab, Byzantine, Roman, Greek, 
late Bronze, and early Bronze periods. 

6. Mesolithic. 

5. Upper Paleolithic — Capsian in type, showing probable relation 
to African culture. 

4, Middle Aurignacian in type. 

3. Middle Aurignacian in type. 

2. Early Middle Aurignacian in type. 

1. Mousterian in type. 

The artifacts of the Mesolithic layer included small flint crescents 
and sickle blades, the latter polished through usage along the toothed 
margins; cores of various sizes and shapes, knives, scrapers, awls, 
etc. There were bone points, many containing one end intact to 
serve as a handle; some were small enough to be needles but without 
an eye, other small ones were pointed at both ends and evidently 
served as fish hooks ; bone harpoons, bone polishing tools, and a bone 
grooved for hafting microliths or perhaps sickle blades. Objects of 
adornment included small bone pendants, a bone bead, and various 
teeth cut and j)ierced for stringing, the canine teeth of a small car- 
nivore l)eing especially numerous. 

The most remarkable of all the finds from this level was a small 
human head carved from a black and grey banded pebble. The hair 
and back of the head were left unfinished. The face was done with 
care : long thick eyebrows, large long eyes, well executed broad but 
not very flat nose, and prominent lips. The neck was partially com- 
pleted. The- whole is about as large as the end of a man's thumb; 
this is the oldest human representation found in Palestine to date 
and may correspond in age to the late Magdalenian of Europe. 

The Mesolithic layer of Mugharet el AVad has thus yielded objects 
hitherto undiscovered in Palestine — the stone human head, the bone 
haft for microliths and the bone harpoons. To these should be 
added from the same site a pierced bone resembling a baton and 



OLD WORLD TREHISTORY — MacCURDY 509 

an animal figure carved in the end of a fragment of long bone, both 
found previously by Mr. Lambert, assistant director of the Depart- 
ment of Antiquities of Palestine. 

Another tind new to Palestine was the nniltiple human burial 
found by the joint expedition in the Mesolithic layer. This con- 
sisted of 10 skeletons — 1 adults and G children including infants. 
These had been piled on a heartli prepared for tlie purpose. The 
burials were all extended and at various angles. The arm bones 
of two were interlocked. The head of an infant had been placed 
on the shoulder of one of the adults. A deer antler, some of the bone 
pendants and the stone head were all from this burial place, the 
stone head being directly beneath the skeletons. An additional 
skeleton was found at the same level in a recess and lying upon its 
right femur was yet another skull. A Hexed skeleton was found in 
the terrace outside, not far from where Lambert had previously 
found two skulls only. 

Below the Mesolithic, there are four occupation levels which can 
be definitely referred to the Middle and LTpper Aurignacian. In this 
Upper Paleolithic deposit were found two human jaw fragments 
and other fragments of human bones, also a number of large human 
teeth. These and the Mesolithic skeletons will be described by Sir 
Arthur Keith. The Aurignacian is also rich in artifacts. Beneath 
the Aurignacian dejiosit, there is a Mousterian layer some two meters 
thick. The third joint Palestine expedition (1931) will complete 
the excavation of this deposit; it will also excavate the nearby Oven 
Cave and Cave of the Kid. 



ANCIENT SEATING FUIINITURE IN THE COLLECTIONS 
OF THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM 



By Walter Ilouon 



[With 21 I'lates] 



The fii-st appearance of detached seating^ furinturo is seen in stools. 
These are accordinn^ to the art ideas of the peoples constructinfj; them 
of varyinfj forms shaped from blocks of wood or stone and havin*; 
usually four leps. The seats are circular, oval, oblonp, and curved, 
or hollowed out, showing the earliest attempts at adapting the area 
to the conformation of the body; one might t«rm it a primitive effort 
at practical anthropometrics. In its simplest form the stool is a 
circular block of wood such as was used by Peruvian tribes and the 
Hupa of California (pi. 1, fig, 1), and perhaps the rounded stone 
blocks of some ancient Pueblos in Arizona. 

Specimens from Costa Rica (pi. 1, figs. 2, 3), West Indies, and Ta- 
hiti have a projecting handle from one end and many American 
specimens have a pierced lug with cord for hanging up, showing that 
this piece of furniture was not commonl}' used but only on occasion. 
This phase will be discussed later. 

Simple stools were often elaborately carved. Wiener ^ figures a 
Peruvian stool of which the seat rests on two excellently carved 
jaguars. British Guiana specimens in the United States National 
Museum and specimens from that region figured by W. E. Roth - and 
by Koch-Griinberg ^ from the Taulipang and other tribes of North 
Brazil and Venezuela are carved stools in the form of tutelary 
animals. These, although evidently used as seats in the house, are 
cult objects. (PI. 2, figs. 1, 2, and 3.) 

The simple stool has a rather wide distribution in Central America, 
the West Indies, and northern South America. The limits of its 
distribution have not been worked out, and it is to be regretted that 
Baron Erland Nordenskijold did not include the stool in his excellent 
work on comparative ethnographical studies.* The stool also extends

into the southern United States. Tlie Creeks in 1666 were described 
as having in their council houses " thrones " for the cacique and 
important persons and " small formes " around the fire for lesser 
people.^ 

Aerican stools are invariably cut from the solid, joining being 
practically absent in Indian arts. In consequence no seats with backs 
or even rudimentar}- beginnings of joined backs are seen in con- 
tinental America, the stool being at first, as suggested, only a but- 
tock prop in the posture of squatting. 

In discussing the stone and pottery objects in the form of stools 
or metates resembling stools from Chirqui, Panama, Dr. W. H. 
Holmes says: 

As bearing upon the possible use of tliese specimens it should be noticed that 
similar stool-like objects are made of clay, the softness and fragility of which 
would render them unsuitable for use as mealing plates or mortars, and it would 
also appear that they are rather fragile for use as stools. I would suggest that 
they may have served as supports for articles such as vases or idols employed 
in religious rites or possibly as altars for offerings." 

From other countries of Central America many remarkable exam- 
ples showing sldll in working stone have been found in archeologic 
sites. In general they follow the form of the Indian stool cut from 
a cylindrical block of wood sectioned from a tree trunk. It is 
altogether likely that the precursors of the stone stools were of 
wood. 

The West Indian specimens surviving are of more aberrant form, 
in some cases reaching to the rank of chairs. (PI. 4.) There are 
three types ; the common 4-legged metate form in stone, a hammock 
form in stone and wood (pi. 3, figs. 1 and 2), and a remarkably ad- 
vanced form of curved-back chair like a steamer chair which seems 
to be a development of the hammock type. Specimens figured by 
Dr. J. Walter Fewkes,'^ used by Prof. O. T. Mason in his descrip- 
tion of the Guesde collection, show that the chair represents a man 
lying on his back with his limbs drawn up to form the legs of the 
piece. The chair is a unique example of aboriginal furniture design, 
comparing favorably in art with an}^ ancient Old World specimens. 
West Indian stools illustrate the advance made by these Indians 
in culture. In some respects they corroborate the theory that tribes 
in an insular environment are helped by their situation to develop 
a high culture. 

Among the more remarkable antiquities found in America are 
the great carved stone seats from the province of Manabi, Ecuador.^

These scats are found in a limited area, where they occur in consid- 
able numbers. They consist of a base, a support carved in animal 
or human form, and a U-shapod seat without back. Undoubtedly 
these seats are of ceremonial character and formed part of the cult 
objects in the flimsily constrnclc.l hill temples which have now dis- 
appeared.* 

In ancient Peru, according to Wiener,^" movable seats were not 
used, and the various great works cut from the solid rock called 
seats have not been explained by archeologists. They have no char- 
acteristics of seats. 

If the Mayas had simple seats of stone or wood, none has sur- 
vived to be noted by explorers. Maya sculpture, however, preserves 
some remarkable examjiles of thrones. One of these is shown with 
a seated figure from the hieroglyphic stairway at Copan.^^ The 
figure is seated on the skin of a jaguar u})on an oblong stool, the 
carved part of which evidently represents woodwork. At one end of 
the stool is seen the head of a captive, a motive appearing often in 
Maya ai-t in which gods are represented as seated on bound victims. 
The stucco altar piece of a small temple at Palenque shows a 
throne seat of massive design of jaguar heads and paws, the former 
being the arms and the latter the feet of this piece. Between the 
jaguar heads, on an elaborately worked cushion like a hassock, sits 
a Maya god with right leg horizontal on the cushion and with out- 
wardly flexed arms, in a graceful pose. This masterpiece of Ameri- 
can aboriginal art is called the Beau Relief.^- The original has 
disappeared through ravages of time, but the drawing made by 
Waldeck fortunately preserves this marvel of design and modeling, 
the climax of aboriginal art in the Western Hemisphere. Doctor 
Holmes, on his visit to Yucatan in 1894, saw enough of the remains 
of this superb work of art to guarantee the accuracy of the artist 
Waldeck's drawing. The Asiatic characteristics of this work are 
noteworthy, but there is no ground for its attribution to any other 
source than American. So far as known the pose of the being 
represented is not duplicated in Maya art. The cushion is also 
unique. (PI. 6.) 

Corresponding to those of America, simple stools are found among 
the tribes of lower culture in Africa and Asia. So far as may be 
ascertained, the use of stools is quite general in Africa, but the 
distribution has not yet been worked out. From the Somali of 
Berbera on the Gulf of Aden comes a round dish-top, 4-legged stool

cut from solid wood. (PI. 7, fig. 1.) The Vai and Ewe of Liberia 
make elaborately carved, curved, and flat seat stools, some with a 
center column surrounded by four legs like the stools of the Ashanti. 
(PL 13, figs. 2 and 3.) The Vai and Grebo have another kind of 
stool of box-shape neatly laid up of squared strips of wood in log 
cabin fashion. (PI. 13, fig. 1.) In the Niger-Benue region, multiple- 
leg stools are found. 

In the Belgian and French Congo a great variety of stools are 
made, some of them remarkable examples of the wood-carver's skill. 
Among the Baluba and Sankerru is found a one or two legged stool 
with openwork curved elliptic seat. (PL 10, fig. 1.) These suggest 
(he chief's backrest collected by Herbert Ward (pi. 10, fig. 2), and 
utilized by him in posing his notable bronze statue, " The Chief of the 
Tribe," in the National Museum (pi. 11). One of the stools in this 
collection is carved from a log, has a band indicating four legs, and is 
carved on the back with a lattice or rickrack pattern on which is 
represented a climbing snake. (PL 8.) 

An elaborately decorated 4-legged stool with nearly straight seat 
having projections of human heads at the ends, is from the Congo 
collection by Herbert Ward. (PL 7, fig. 3.) In the Ward collection 
is also a notable specimen of wood carving consisting of two disks 
connected with four decorated bowed bands. (PL 9, fig. 1.) In 
another specimen a woman sits on a disk and holds up the seat on her 
head and arms. (PL 9, fig. 2.) As an example of what may be con- 
sidered acculturation, a 4-legged stool with back braced by thongs 
is shown from the Gribo of the western Sudan. (PL 7, fig. 2.) 

In the C. C. Roberts collection in the United States National 
Museum from the Ashanti of the ivory coast of the Niger River 
Basin, is a fine stool of hardwood in the form of a leopard, the 
realistic carving, especially the head, reminding one of the Egyptian 
carvings of cats. (See Maspero, Art in Egypt, N. Y., 1922, Fig. 195.) 
(PL 12, fig. 2.) Another, from the Cameroon, more conventionally 
carved, gives an impression of the massive stolidity of an elephant 
at rest. The handling of masses and relating of lines is worthy of 
study. (PL 12, fig. 1.) 

Asia for the most part shows no development of seating furniture, 
a reclining position and cushions being indicated for the customs 
of the predominating peoples. Among the less civilized peoples of 
Malaysia, stools occur. In the island of Nias, round and oblong 
4-legged stools for common use are seen. (PL 14, figs. 1-3.) Figures 
of ancestral gods in carved wood are sometimes seated on a 4-legged 
stool and also on a cylindrical support. (PL 15, figs. 1-2.) The 
Tagals of the Philippines make 4-legged joined bamboo seats, but 
these may or may not show traces of acculturation. (PL 16, figs.

1-2.) A well-finished hardwood stool from Tahiti indicates that 
tlie Polynesians of this island had advanced to the use of seating 
furniture. (PI. IT.) 

Otherwise anion*; the Polynesians the only example noted is a 
4-legged stool from Hawaii illustrated in the Edge-Partinj^ton and 
Heape Album. The seat is practically absent in the islands of the 
Pacific. 

The simpler forms of seating furniture were widespread in 
Europe. Not until the seventeenth century did chairs become usual. 
Until the middle of the sixteenth century a chair in the hall or in 
the master's chamber was the rule and was '' the chair," hence chair- 
man for presiding otiicer. Others sat on benches or movable forms. 
Benches and chests formed the basis of the interesting development 
of household furniture in Europe. This subject has been excellently 
treated by H. Cliti'ord Smith. ^^ The ancient stool was also connnon 
in the folk furniture of Europe, but it was always joined. It is said 
that an inventory of 1G24 at Gilling Castle, Yorkshire, mentions only 
two chairs, but lists 35 stools. Also, in 16G9, when Charles II enter- 
tained the Grand Duke of Tuscany at dinner, the only chair was 
provided for the guest of honor. 

In the ancient centers of civilization something may be recov- 
ered of the manner of seating furniture used. Monuments give in 
some cases abundant data. The statue of Gudea, about 2500 B. C, 
shows this king seated on a stool having four feet. The pairs of 
legs at the ends are pierced, giving them somewhat the form of 
the capital letter A. Upon these rests the seat. The ends were 
probably cut from a single slab of wood and the seat joined on by a 
mortise. (PI. 18.) On the monument of Hammurabi, 2267-2213 
B. C, at Susa is represented that king before the sun god, Sammas. 
The sun god is seated on a low chair throne which seems to be 
joined work of slats of wood symmetrically arranged, as seen in 
the quadrangular panel at the side of the throne presented in the 
relief. (PI. 19.) A more elaborate seat and other remarkably de- 
signed furniture is seen in a votive tablet from Sippur, Mesapotamia. 
(PI. 20.) The explorations of Doctor Woolley at Ur bring to light 
a similar scene of about 2700 B. C, showing a figure seated in a 
joined chair with rungs, cushion, and back. This chair is of superior 
design and workmanship and is to all intents and purposes a modern 
piece of furniture.'* (PI. 21.)

furniture of Egypt contrasts favorably with that of any period. 
Wall paintings show the nianu,f acture of chairs and other furniture, 
workmen making parts, indicating the division of labor. It is very 
likely that Egypt must be looked to for the first great development 
of joinery. Even with our knowledge of the skill of the Egyptians 
in designing furniture, the luxurious pieces taken by Howard Carter 
from the tomb of Tut-Ankh-Amen excite our liveliest w^onder. The 
ordinary people, in the midst of sumptuous furniture enjoyed by the 
favored, were content with the very ancient stool. 

Greek furniture reflects the art feeling of that highly cultured 
nation. The chair in which sits Aphrodite as portraj^ed by the 
Tanagra artist of Boetia in the figure in the Berlin Museum is a work 
of splendor, massiveness, and genius. (PL 22.) A cast of a great 
seat of carved marble which was the chair of Dionysos Eleuthereus 
from the theater of Dionysos at Athens, fifth century B. C, is 
exhibited in the British Museum. (PI. 23.) 

Something is kniown concerning the cult usages connected with 
the stool or simple seats mentioned as occurring among uncivilized 
tribes; more with regard to joined chairs appearing in the higher 
civilizations and the thrones or seats of honor of gods and monarchs. 

W. C. Farabee states that the men of the Jivaro Indians of East- 
ern Peru sit on stools and the women must sit on the floor.^^ The 
stool here is the particular possession of men. In British Guiana 
the Indians have in their houses stools that are used indiscriminately 
and others carved in the form of animals as the alligator and 
" tiger," upon which a candidate for admission into a society was 
made to sit down during initiation. Stools in animal shape evi- 
dently had a fetishistic intent.^*' Divining seats carved in the form 
of the macaw or tiger and alligator combined are used in the prac- 
tices of the Arawak doctors of British Guiana.^'^ 

According to observers of 1556 the Samoyed shamans of Siberia 
have a stool with a back which they use in their incantations. Refer- 
ence is also made to a similar seat from the Indians of the northwest 
coast of America.^* It is probable this seat went out of use among 
these Indians many years ago. From the description, "An arm 
chair of cedar boards without legs," apparently a modified chest is 
meant. 

Here and there are found traces of the employment of special

ANCIENT SEATING FURNITURE — HOUGH 517 

hon or object honored, much as cult images are seated and placed 
in temples. 

Tiic placing of effigies of gods on bases or thrones may have a 
bearing on seating furniture. This interesting phase was sug- 
gested to the writer many years ago by the late Dr. Stewart Culin. 
The more primitive images had no bases except in some cases a 
necessary device to secure eciuilibrium. The square plinlli appears 
to be the hi-st move toward the placing of images. Art and religion, 
inseparably associated in a constructive way for a long period, were 
the determinative causes of the development of placement. 

Seats required in occupations form an interesting series of objects. 
The only American occupational scat is a 3-legged stool upon which 
the Eskimo hunter sits while fisliing through the ice. The seat 
is a light, well-made piece of joined work. Occupational seats per- 
haps present the first diversification of seating furniture, of which 
our great variety is the culmination. 

The general distribution of chairs in civilized countries shows 
one of the notable developments of modern progress. From the 
simple benches and stools of the seventeenth century there has come 
a great variety of seating furniture satisfying every need for art, 
luxury, taste, convenience, and practical use. 

It is suggested that development of seats, aided by art and 
invention, was fostered by the increasing delicacy and complexity of 
the costumes of men and women. It is likely that the modification 
of seats beyond the simple stool was mainlj^ through the factor of 
fashion except in the special uses mentioned. This is plainly seen 
in the head rest ^® originating in response to fashion in hair 
dressing. 

In spite of modern vaunted progress, it seems that the efforts of 
the present age go little beyond that displayed in the furniture of 
ancient Egypt except in materials and mechanical arts. The indus- 
try, however, has grown to enormous proportions. The outstanding 
invention of our age is the ancestorless rocking chair. Folding 
chairs which seem to be consonant with modern invention have an 
ancient hi-story, it being Iniown from surviving specimens recovered 
in Europe that Roman generals carried iron folding chairs into the 
field. A drawing on a Greek amphora of about 500 B. C, in the 
United States National Museum represents a figure seated on a 
folding chair of metal. (PI. 24.) A Greek black-figured plate of 
the sixth century B. C, in the IJoyal Ontario Museum of Archeology, 
Toronto, Canada, shows Dionysos and Poseidon seated on such 
chairs with Athene standing between them.*°

The use of animal forms so prevalent in the art of stools and 
chairs is apparently normal in all art at a certain stage and grows 
out of the importance of animals in cult. The stool in many cases 
is nothing more than a practical appliance for raising the body 
from the ground, but at times is found to take on a cult phase due 
to social advances, that is, it becomes an adjunct of social superiority 
and is designed accordingly to convey some symbolic evidences of 
power. Chairs set apart the sitter and elevate him in more than 
one sense. Hence seats are made in the form of totemic animals or 
those supposed to possess attributes of cunning, strength, or ferocity. 

Whatever of suggestiveness aside from cult ideas was involved 
in the animal-leg furniture of Egypt it is difficult to say. The artist 
in designing furniture would be likely to know more ancient models 
which he would use, or he might see that a 4-legged chair or couch 
suggests a quadruped intended to bear the weight of the sitter and 
thus be led to model the legs after some animal. Unquestionably 
these changes in style are frequent and are characteristic of the 
designer's art, but it is logical to trace them back to the animal cults 
of the mythologic period so convincingly elaborated by Andrew Lang 
in his Myth, Ritual, and Religion.^^ In many, perhaps a major- 
ity of cases, the practical side of seating furniture is seen to develop 
parallel with cult ideas introduced into seats. These are seen in the 
illustrations of many seats carved out in curious forms and lavishly 
decorated but evidently expressing no cult idea.

Author'a mtto. — Tho avuilalilo data rognrdin;,' liriiuitivc art arc ciK-ycIopodic in 
scope, but are not always readily accessii)lo. In a brief article covorinK con- 
tinental America, the barest of mention is made of several styles of decorative 
and representative art. New data are oflfered for consideration along with 
facts that are well known, while principles of primitive design are treated from 
a geographic point of view, considering tribal groups as they existed before 
their disruption after contact with the white race. 

STYLE IN PRIMITIVE DECORATIVE ART 

Geographic stdbUity of design. — In primitive society decorative 
designs appear as excrescences embellishing the arts and crafts. 
They constitute the hall mark of the primitive artisan. Charac- 
teristic forms of decorative design, like the technical structure or 
style of its artistic expression are local in their development. Art 
designs never wander far afield, and scarcely ever flourish when 
borrowed. Each of tho more generally diffused elements of design 
as the triangle and zigzag or alternate spur, the spiral, the swastika 
or axial cross, and the meandered guilloche has a distinct local style 
which may never be mistaken when once one has become familiar 
with it in its local setting. Many examples of the ideosyncrasies of 
style might be cited. The designs of the Eskimo engraved on ivory 
tusks of the walrus or prehistoric mammoth and carvings in the 
round on wood by the Pacific Northwest Coast Indian tribes are 
characteristic each of a definite style area even to the point of dif- 
ferentiation of many subareas of design. Thus the Tlingit animal 
totem of southeast Alaska, though a realistic form of sculpture in 
wood, appears plain and crude when contrasted with the same 
totemic pattern as treated by the Haida, their British Columbian 
neighbors on the soutli. Again, the wood carving of the Maori of 
New Zealand with its repeated embellishment of engraved spirals 
may never be mistaken for decorative carvings of the Melanesians 
whose designs are likewise frequently characterized by the engraved 

519 



520 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

spiral. The same individuality of style may be seen in the peculiar 
body tattoo marks of the Marquesan Islanders, or in the metal 
crafts of Nigerian tribes, in woven textiles of the Haussa, or in 
pottery of the Ashanti of the Ivory and Gold coasts of West Africa. 

There seems to be a key design peculiar to each distinctive art area 
that unlocks the secret of the origin of other designs from the same 
area. Frequently this key is merely a conventionalized form applied 
to any of the arts as textiles, wood carvings, pottery, or metal crafts. 
Examples are the cat or dog designs stamped on Peruvian textiles; 
the molded zoomorphic figurine heads on West Indian pottery; the 
engraved dog, leech, and leaf designs in Malaysia; the frigate bird 
design in Polynesia; or the double spiral and crocodile pattern of 
Melanesia. African metal work is distinctive; its various elements 
of form and design can not be mistaken for Malay metal work, each 
having its distinctive origin and development; for example, the 
modern brass and bronze casting of Benin in west central Africa 
was introduced by the Portuguese in the eighteenth century, and has 
a European flavor. In a similar way bronze castings and objects of 
iron from the Bronze and Iron Ages of prehistoric Europe are 
distinct from modern African metal work, while Malay metallurgy 
has Asiatic affiliations. 

Application to the demands of the practical arts generally oc- 
cupies civilized man to a far greater degree than it does the un- 
civilized. Somehow it seems that with the increased comfort and 
security characteristic of modern western civilization go augmented 
duties impinging on that portion of the universal culture complex 
that among all peoples passes under the name of artistry. 

RealisTn of Magdalenian art. — The primitive artist works with the 
media with which he is most familiar. This may be seen in the 
cave art of the Magdalenian, whose serious occupation never exceeded 
that of the hunter. This artist, therefore, permitted free range to 
his artistic impulses to draw and to model animal life as he knew it. 
Game animals are most frequently represented. The horse and the 
red deer, also the lion and the hyena are depicted. The artists of the 
Old Stone Age produced realistic representations of bison, horse, and 
mammoth with a true appreciation of form. In plastic as in the 
graphic arts they modeled or depicted both animal and human forms. 
Sculpture in bone and in ivory display their ability to catch a pose. 
Life attitudes are perpetuated in their incised drawings. Even in 
the use of color there is a fine appreciation of values, particularly 
with regard to blends and shades. 

Culture change and decay of design. — In the history of primitive 
decorative design there have been periods of progress and of retro- 
gression. Ketrogression in art forms appears to have followed

ABORIGINAL DECORATIVE ART — KRIEGER 521 

closely on the invention of weapons, tools, and implenieiits serving 
to make for chan<;e in the practical arts, as hunting;. Decadence 
in art forms forni(>rly chisoly associated with arts of daily life fol- 
lowed the close of the Mairdalenian culture period in Europe, as all 
attention apparently went into the shaping: and production of the new 
accessories of material culture durinfj the Azilian and early Neolithic, 
before the full blossominu: of the New Stone Aire both in the Old 
"World and in the New. 

With the invention of pottery in the Neolithic come new forms 
and with it new styles of graphic and decorative arts. Cave life 
had passed; the outlook upon the world had become that of the 
sedentary tillers of the soil. As the arts of the new era were 
mastered, new decorative designs hinged not upon geographical 
and occupational areas, but upon inventions in tool making and new 
forms of weapons and implements. In Europe there followed at 
an accelerated pace after the close of the New Stone Age, an age of 
Bronze, and later an age of Iron. In Europe, neither the Neolithic, 
the Bronze, nor the Iron Ages paused long enough to permit full 
flowering of crafts and arts into artistic forms. Geometrical de- 
signs alone survived, and if we are to judge from the unhappy 
modeling of the human figure in the Neolithic, realistic representa- 
tions in Europe were lacking from each of the great periods fol- 
lowing the ^Magdalenian. Save for ornaments almost all of our 
knowledge of Bronze Age design is derived from geometrical decora- 
tions on weapons such as knives, swords, and shields, and on imple- 
ments. Even the pictographic art of Neolithic and post-Neolithic 
Europe is more crudely done than that dating back to the 
Magdalenian. 

What is 'pi'imitive art? — Primitive art as usually understood, how 
ever, is the product of geographic areas and of peoples who have 
for some reason not shared in the technical development centering 
about metallurgy in Europe. Other great metallurgical centers, 
as southeastern Asia and central Africa, developed art styles more 
commensurate with local developments in culture generally and 
were not disturbed by the early organized diffusion of western trait 
complexes. 

When man attempts to represent objects of nature through the 
graphic arts of drawing, engraving, or painting, he is confronted 
with the problem of showing 3-dimensional objects on 2-dimen- 
sional surfaces. Primitive peoples solve this problem in a manner 
different from ours. Perspective is utilized by the civilized artist 
to give a visual presentation of the object as it appears to us in 
photography. The primitive artist realized that such a view must 
exclude from vision certain features essential for its recognition, 



522 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

the eye, for instance, when the individual is seen from the back. 
Primitive art puts the eye in the picture regardless of its misplaced 
position and a pictograph gives way among the uncivilized to an 
ideographic presentation of essential features regardless of relative 
position. Profile views with both eyes showing or distortion of 
features to bring them into the picture are thus characteristic of 
primitive design. 

Art styles, while products of cultural change, are in the main 
geographic. With many characteristics in common, areas in primi- 
tive art are recognizable. Thus South American and West Indian 
Arawak delineation of the human body is in the form of a triangle 
with the point downward, or in the form of a rectangle, the two 
descending lines of the triangle or rectangle being continued as legs, 
while the horizontal line at the top represents the shoulder line and 
is continued outward to represent the arms. In other areas the hu- 
man body is often represented by a curved line which is open below 
and terminates in the legs and feet. The Eskimo silhouette shows 
only the outline of the figure depicted, but a realistic impression is 
conveyed nevertheless. The Indian artist of the American Pacific 
coast filled in details of a realistic nature in a distinctly modern 
manner. 

Symmetry. — Body decoration in the form of tattooing, painting, 
and cicatrization takes on a peculiar local style which may be dis- 
tinguished when analyzed according to the principles of form in art. 
The symmetrical arrangement of lines whether etched, tattooed, or 
painted is frequently the key. The Andaman Islanders and other 
Oceanic peoples decorate their bodies with symmetrical patterns; 
Australian boomerangs, churingas, and message sticks have sym- 
metrically incised or painted designs. Symmetry in beadwork in 
America and Malaysia may also be noted. Even the Fuegians of 
South America understand symmetry in body decoration. 

It is strange that among primitive peoples the lower forms of deco- 
rative art follow certain principles or elements in art design which 
are violated wlien once this primitive people has reached the stage of 
pottery manufacture. Symmetry in pottery design is not obtainable 
without the aid of a potter's wheel, which was never invented in any 
of the pottery-making areas of America or Oceania. The corrugated 
effect produced by the pueblo potter by means of thumbprints on the 
yet plastic coils of clay represents one type of pueblo design that is 
symmetrical. Bilaterally applied zoomorphic figurine heads on 
earthenware bowls of the eastern United States and the West Indies 
are other examples of the balancing of unsymmetrical pottery vessels 
through decorative embellishment. Bannerstones of the Indians of 
Pennsylvania have symmetrical bird or wing shapes. Vertical 



ABORIGINAL DECORATIVE ART KRIKGER 523 

symmetry may also be observed in Melanesian shields or in their 
designs on paddles and arrows, also on Polynesian dressing;: boxes 
of carved wood. Decorations of Melanesian houses have a rhythmic 
repetition of desi«;n motive. Banded patterns on bamboo, althouj^h 
ditferint; one from another, are symmetrical in themselves and are 
repeated at rhjthmic intervals giving a pleasing effect for the pat- 
tern as a whole. The omission, inversion, and distortion of pat- 
tern is carried out with almost mathematical precision. In Peru- 
vian art on textiles, stamped blocks each incorporating a conven- 
tionalized life form of a cat or lish, for example, are repeated at 
regular intervals. Perhaps the simplest form of this rhythmic repe- 
tition pertains to brasses, bronzes, and iron objects from Malay and 
other oriental metal-work centers. Figures carved in the round, 
altliough produced by the Maori, the Melanesian, the African, the 
Haida of the Pacific northwest coast, the Aztec, the Eskimo, and 
the prehistoric West Indian Arawak, yet are sufliciently distinjctive 
to become a ke}' or index to the art of a geographic design area. In 
carving in the round, certain subsidiary principles arbitrary in their 
nature lead up to differences in their execution. The element of 
grotesqueness, frequently misunderstood, en,ters into the designs of 
each of the areas just mentioned so far as carvings in the round are 
considered. The omission of parts, the repetition of others, the mis- 
placement to fit the media on which the design is applied — all these 
principles are well understood by the primitive wood carver; yet for 
each there is a difference in st3de. 

Tools. — Tools used in executing art motives frequently effect a 
difference in the finished product, in other words, in style. The 
North American Indian uses a knife having a single-curved cutting 
edge while the African uses a straight double-edged knife. Not only 
in tools do we see a cause for the development of different art styles, 
even when applied to the same element of design such as the spiral, 
but in the manner, in which they are used do we find a considerable 
difference in the end results. This may be illustrated through the 
use of hammers whether held in the hand or attached to a handle. 
Cultural habits complicate the explanation of styles in art still fur- 
ther. Squatting tribes, for example, naturally do not develop artis- 
tically embellished stools or seats. A develo})ment of art in hair 
coiffures naturally leads to the invention and ultimate artistic em- 
bellishment of a neck rest. This we sec at its best in Africa and in 
Japan. Development of tools in the form of molds, stamps, dies, 
patterns, drills, and bellows are but a few that might be named as 
having made possible the progress of design. 

Rhythm. — The use of some one feature or detail repeatedly to 
express entirely different ideas is perhaps seen to best advantage 
in tlie repeated use of the eye motive by the Pacific northwest coast 



524 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

Indian tribes. Other peoples also make repeated use of the eye 
motive. However, it remains an eye with them even when repeated- 
ly used in a meander or scrolled design. In northwest coast Indian 
designs, however, the eye may represent joints, such as the elbow or 
the knee ; it may represent the arm or leg, simply standing as a part 
for the whole; or it may represent the entire animal in conjunction 
with one or two other conventionalized features. The incised circle 
and dot, or nucleated circle in flat relief occurs widely in North and 
South America, but is used in a different way among different tribes. 
The Eskimo and the tribes of the upper plateau apparently use it in 
a purely decorative way without any symbolical or representative 
value. On pottery from South America and the West Indies, the 
circle and dot element becomes the eye, or it may stand for some 
particular kind of eye and thus represent a bird or a snake or the 
entire reptilian family. 

Art areas. — The character of decorative primitive art is capable of 
geographic treatment. Art of a given kind characterizes a given 
region, with borders sometimes fairly definite, sometimes merging 
into the art designs and motives of adjoining regions by minute de- 
grees of transition. Each tribe has art not exactly duplicated by 
that of any other. Even isolated villages within the tribal area 
develop marked divergences in design clearly intelligible to those 
who know. 

Art areas, however, usually include several tribes occupying a geo- 
graphical unit. The Eskimo constitute an art area, also a culture 
area, although they are not a single tribe. Linguistically the entire 
Arctic is a single area in the sense that the language spoken by an 
Eskimo in Canada may be understood by a north Siberian aborigine 
even though not an Eskimo. In ceramic and other art developments 
cropping out of a perfected pottery technique, we find eastern Siouan, 
Muskhogean, Caddoan, Timucuan, Calusan, and other tribal stocks 
sharing one art area, connected with West Indian and northern 
Colombian tribal designs. Likewise in the wooded sections of the 
Great Lakes and of the upper Mississippi Valley we may speak of a 
great art area shared by diverse linguistic and tribal stocks. 

The general use of the swastika or almost all symbolism in the 
form of variants of the cross has a different application, and differ- 
ent meanings attached as we proceed from country to country and 
tribe to tribe. The use of the spiral is so widespread as to be of no 
significance in itself, although the technic employed in its execution 
may betray the maker. The spiral, common alike to painted designs 
on pueblo pottery in the Southwest and to etched designs on bamboo 
or wood in Polynesia or in lower Melanesia, can everywhere in the 
three areas be distinguished as to the maker by the crudity or excel- 
lence of workmanship. The spiral and associated double-curve 



r

(losi<j;n representing originally zoomorphic forms, as the horns of the 
water buffalo in Celebes or the frigate bird in Polynesia, are almost 
mechanically perfect when incised on bamboo or gourds in western 
Polynesia. The spiral is crudely done in Melanesia and New 
Cruinea. Not only are individual designs poorly or well done in one 
area, but all of the designs share alike and take their cue from the 
(juality of the key design. We may thus speak of the excellence or 
of the crudity of design as characteristic of art areas. 

The discrepancies observable between a similar art design of one 
tribe and that of another, and between one culture area and that of 
anotlier show that designs and motives become devitalized as they 
travel from area to area. Designs like the cross and the swastika 
originated in more tlian one area, and have traveled no great 
distances. 

Design motivation. — Types of art are recognizable by tlicir pre- 
dominant motives. Realism in ]Magdalenian and early Mediterra- 
nean art has been mentioned. Although realism enters into the de- 
signs of several geographical art areas, there are peculiarities char- 
acteristic of each of the areas. Dominance of a pattern of a simihir 
nature in distinct or widely separated geographic areas, such as the 
*' archaic " forms of human and animal figurines modeled in earth- 
enware, found alike in the Valley of Mexico, and in South America, 
has mistakenly led to the assumption that the areas were directly 
related. Similarity in embellishment of an artistic nature is often 
accompanied, however, by structural differences in the object on 
which the artistic embellisliment appears. Differences in symbolism 
or use may accompany similar artistic devices and designs. Plow 
many meanings, for instance, have not been read into forms of the 
cross or swastika? 

Geometrical motives predominate where the designs are associated 
with basketry, or beads, or woven objects generally. It is a ques- 
tion whether their appearance on other materials, such as shell, wood, 
and other media, may be ascribed to the exigencies of a weaver's 
technic, when, as is the case in the art of Plains tribes, where weav- 
ing of textiles is not practiced, triangular and other painted devices 
are applied on rawhide boxes and pouches. 

It is but recently in the history of our own western art that wo 
have been freed from the tendencies to add features deemed essential 
but which were not conveyed by a pliotographic impression, which 
is but a momentary one. Thus, on the old pictorial maps we sec 
not only lines of latitude, coast lines, and contour features, but ships 
at sea, dragons of the doop, and perhaps other objects designed to 
teach a moral lesson. A succession of impressions were placed in 
juxtaposition. 



526 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

In painting we wish to see permanent colors, expressing ideas and 
idealizations, not impressions of the moment. Thus the contrast 
between photography and what we consider fundamental appears 
even in modern civilized art, although civilized style of presentation 
of such permanent features is far more sophisticated, and often more 
pleasing, than is the case with primitive art. 

Conventionalism in primitive art need not be unrealistic; when 
possible, as in clay modeling or in wood carving, realistic portraiture 
is quite commonl}'- found along with conventional or grotesque 
designs. 

Modern Malayan art, for example, ranges far superior to pre- 
historic European achievement. It was only with the coming of 
Grecian influence to northern Europe that art forms developed there 
beyond the initial crude stage of the later Stone Age. 

MASKS 

The primary association of the mask is with serious religious 
practices rather than with decorative art. With this, however, is 
combined the semireligious masked dance. The use of death masks 
in aboriginal America is perhaps limited to that section of the west- 
ern highlands both of North and South America where the use of 
the mask itself had reached its greatest development. The mask 
was used in ancient Peru and the false head or mask is a common 
accessory with Peruvian mummies. 

Contrasting with the false head on mummy bundles there appears 
in the lowland region of South America a form of dance mask. Its 
use is quite extensive as far north as the valley of the Orinoco 
Kiver. In Mexico and in Central America the use of the mask 
apparently was general. The mosaic mask of the Aztec is a wooden 
mask which was overlaid with designs built up with small particles 
of turquoise. The stone temples in Mayan territory show in low 
relief profiles of priests wearing masks. Sometimes these temples 
have panels of plumed warriors and priests in low relief. 

In the United States many tribes were apparently not addicted 
to the use of the mask. In the Northeast were the Iroquois, who 
were specialists in the manufacture and use of masks carved from 
single blocks of wood. Such masks were grotesque, with lips pro- 
truding, nose at tilt, and eye sockets cavernous. These faces rep- 
resent mythical creatures essentially human. In the more totemic 
tribes the representations on masks are of animals, birds, and mon- 
sters of various descriptions. Between these two extremes we find 
man^T^ tribes, both east of the Mississippi and on, the Western 
plains, among whom masks were in vogue. East of the Mississippi, 
the Cherokee, Chippewa, Delaware, Choctaw, and Seminole used 



ABORIGINAL DECORATIVE ART KRIEGER 527 

carved wooden masks. The tribes of the Pacific northwest coast, 
however, i-oached tlu* hijzhcst development in mask carvin;;. 

In Micronesia and Mehmesia nnmerous wooden masks were fasli- 
ioned cuhninating in the masqnerade costume of the Papuans of 
New Guinea. Tlie ^Nfalay ])eoples deveh)ped the marionette rather 
than the ma>.k, although there are certain traces of the primitive 
mask in central Celebes and Borneo. In Siam and Java, and on up 
into tiie continental hinterland of Eastern Asia, the elaborate ilemon 
and devil mask is everywhere present. The demon mask of the 
Tibetans is the most striking example of this sort. In structure the 
masks are simi)le where the cerenumy is simple; where the ritual is 
more elaborate the masks are also complex. 

In structure the Tibetan mask, in a way, is reminiscent of the 
mosaic masks of Mexico. Such casual resemblance, howevei*, must 
be ascribed to the natural limitation of the mask rather than to an 
actual cultural contact or to a diffusion of this form of mask. 

rFudf^e J. G. Swan, one of the earliest students of northwest coast 
Indian lore, describes a ceremou}' which he witnessed and <^ives 
.some information regarding the structure of the wooden mask of 
the northwest coast Indian, " Some are very ingeniously executed, 
having the eyes and lower jaw movable by means of a string so the 
performer can make the eyes roll about and the jaws gnash together 
with a fearful clatter. As these masks are kept strictly concealed 
until the time of the performances and as they are generally })ro- 
(hiced at night, they are viewed with awe by the spectators, and 
certainly the scene in one of these lodges dimly lighted by the fires 
wiiich show the faces of the assembled spectators and illuminate the 
l>erformers, presents a most weird and savage spectacle when the 
nnisked dancers issue forth from behind a screen of mats and go 
through their barbarous pantomimes. The Indians themselves, even 
accustomed as they are to masks, feel very much afraid of them, 
and a white man viewing the scene for the first time can only liken 
it to a carnival of demons." 

Masks are not always identical in size with tlie human head or 
the head of the animal they are supposed to represent. They may 
be modeled in miniature, or they may be grotesquely enlarged. The 
.stone and bone images worn on their forehead by the West Indian 
Arawak. also the carved whalebone or horn mask worn on the brow 
of the Shaman of the Pacific northwest coast Indian tribes, are 
diminutive examples. Some of the largest and most grotesque 
masks known come from widely separated areas. From central New 
Guinea comes the demon dancing mask, which not only covers the 
entire body of the dancer, but projects 10 to 15 feet above the bearer's 
head. Bird ma.sks from the northwest coast are frequently large 



528 ANNUAL KEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

enough to completely hide the operator. The human form assumed 
at v/ill by all animate creatures is often represented in compound 
masks just beneath the animal's snout or beak. Often the animal 
mask is fitted as an outer false face covering the inner mask of 
human features. During a ceremony the outer mask is made to open 
up and reveal the inner face. 

Formerly among most primitive peoples the mask was more or 
less of a personal possession of the shaman or medicine man. Only 
he could make the masks. Later, anyone might make or use them at 
will. Still later in our own civilization masks are a staple object of 
trade, having first lost most of their original significance. Some of 
the reasons given by the shaman for assuming the spirit of the animal, 
figuratively speaking, and for donning the features of the animal 
itself in the form of a mask, are to cure disease, forecast success or 
lack of success during the coming hunting or fishing season, to ward 
off danger from enemies, to supplicate the gods for rain to break 
a drought, to insure production and plentiful supplies. They are 
always intimately associated with fertility rites. In other words, the 
use of the mask originated as a purely selfish method of getting the 
properties of mythical and actual creatures to aid the individual. 
This is best typified among the Jivaro Indians of Ecuador. A warrior 
takes possession of his enemy's soul and becomes endowed with all 
of his strength by the simple process of successfully cutting off the 
enemy's head. It is then carried suspended from the belt and is a 
great aid to the Jivaro warrior. A similar belief motivates the 
Tfugao of Luzon when he goes on a head-hunting expedition. 

As the material of which masks are usually made is limited to cer- 
tain objects such as wood, basketry, bark, hair, or woven fabrics, gen- 
erally, there appears to be a remarkable similarity in the maslvs of cer- 
tain widely separated peoples. Thus the wooden mask of the western 
Eskimo is practically identical with the wooden mask of the Melane- 
sians of New Ireland, a remote island in the South Pacific. Or 
again, a typical wooden mask from Java resembles very much the 
earthenware masks from western China. The Iroquois Indian mask 
is very much like that of the Cherokee and other Indian tribes of the 
Southeastern States, which, in turn, resembles those of the Alaskan 
Eskimo. Perhaps the closest resemblance is between peoples whose 
territory joins, as western Eskimo and northwest coast Indians, Mel- 
anesians and Polynesians. Thus the masks made by the Eskimo of 
the western Alaskan coast are copied by the Indians of the Yukon 
Valley. In a collection of 30 masks from Anvik, Alaska, a Tinne 
village perhaps 50 miles from the nearest Eskimo habitation, identity 
with western Eskimo masks in form, structure, and use is striking. 
Not only are the different masks representing different animals iden- 



ABORIGINAL DECORATIVE ART — KRIEGER 529 

tical in name, but their detailed ceremonial use corresponds. These 
masks are used in ceremonies havinj; to do with usherin*; in the hunt- 
ing or tlie lisliing season. It is sinceri'ly bolievod by the E.skimo, and 
also by the Tinne on the Yukon, that proper ceremonies insure 
success in their ociMioniic undertakings. The celebration in which 
animals masks play an important part is always accompanied by a 
feast, popularly referred to as a potlatch, a term that originated far 
to the south among the Tlingit of southeast Alaska. 

Among primitive peoples generally, the relation of animals with 
humans is based more or less on magic. Animals are supposedly 
gifted with magic ])()wers of assuming human forms at will, of per- 
forming supernatural acts, aiul generally conducting themselves 
so as to defy the laws of nature. Therefore they must be propitiated, 
especially during crises in human life. 

It seems that the bear, along with the raven and the coyote, are 
about on a par with the fox and the bear in European folk lore. 
These animals have supernatural powers; they are sly, they are 
tricksters, and at the same time they are culture heroes. The anal- 
ogy between animal folk lore of Europeans and primitive peoples 
generally is almost startling. 

A typical mask ceremony of the Yukon Indians is know^n as the 
" feast of animal souls." Its object is to assure success in hunting, 
and it is therefore celebrated in midwinter when the hunting season 
is best. Representations of the animals are carved on the ends of 
sticks which are stuck up at various spots in the community gather- 
ing place or kashime. Inflated bladders of as nuiny different kinds 
of game animals as possible are contributed by the different families 
of the community. These are hung on a cord stretched across the 
kashime and the cord is shaken, causing the bladders to rattle. Dur- 
ing the progress of the feast everyone must be reverent in his be- 
havior, taking care to step softly in entering the kashime, and taking 
their places without noise or unseemly behavior. There is a succes- 
sion of songs illustrating animal stories and legends. Boys repre- 
senting the various families of the community are dressed in their 
furs with ornaments of wolf tails and wolf heads. A form of ice 
cream is then brought into the kashime in great bowls; on each bowl 
are stuck small models of deadfalls and other objects having to do 
with the hunt. The ceremonial eating of ice cream is observed in 
strict silence, even the whisper of a child being subject to severe 
reprimand. All of the animal ma.sk feasts or ceremonies of the 
Tinne are very carefully rehearsed even to the waving of the feather 
plumes and the beating of drums. It is at the same time both pleas- 
ing and ludicrous to observe the graceful movements of the dancere 
who during rehearsals are encumbered with their babies and their 



530 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

heavy out-of-door clothing. The ceremonial preparation and eating 
of ice cream is a trait extending from one end of the Tinne territory 
to the other, " Ice cream" is a concoction of bear fat, fish oil, prefer- 
ably deer fat, blueberries or other berries, ceremonially stirred with 
the hand and arm bared to the elbow, during which time not a soul 
in the assembled throng is permitted to speak. Snow is slowly 
mixed with the other ingredients until the whole assumes the creamy 
pinkness of ice cream. When deer fat is used the preparation is 
edible enough, but with the addition of rancid oils and fats, more 
or less putrified, the concoction becomes unpalatable to the uniniti- 
ated. All night long stories are told about the hawk, the deer, and 
other animals, the women gladly sharing in the labor of making the 
ice cream so that their husbands shall have success in hunting. 

The wearing of a mask is the usual method of impersonating the 
animal counterpart of a mythical human-animal being. When the 
American Indian impersonates a butt'alo or a bear he puts the skin 
of the head over his own head and looks out through the eye holes. 
The effect is heightened by having the whole skin falling over the 
shoulders of the wearer and down the back. When' a wooden image 
of a bear head is carved, the northwest coast Indian impersonates 
the bear and skillfully increases the illusion by growling and walk- 
ing about bear fashion. 

The antiquity of the animal dance is evidenced by many etchings 
and paintings on rocks of cave walls and of cliffs, such an important 
ceremonial as the Hopi snake dance, which is an ancient prayer for 
rain, being etched in detail on rock cliffs near Flagstaff, Ariz. The 
so-called Katchina mask occurs as a rock etching or painting 
throughout a wide area of the Southwest. 

Most of the masks used by primitive peoples depend upon the en- 
vironment for the material of which they are shaped. Thus the 
West Indian Arawak developed a culture in stone not native to their 
ancestral home in the forested lowlands of South America. This 
art culminated in the stone maskettes of Porto Rico and Santo 
Domingo. Similarly we may refer to the high development of wood 
carving among the tribes of the Pacific Northwest coast region. 
Reaching its highest development somewhere in southeast Alaska or 
British Columbia, this extensive art area extended as far north as 
the Arctic coast of Alaska and as far south as central California. 
Throughout this entire area the use of masks prevailed. Another 
extensive area in the development of masks was ancient Mexico. 
Here, however, as in the West Indies, we again find a development 
of sculptured forms in stone. Iji the Old World — that is, in China, 
India, and in the outlying districts of Hindu culture — masks play 
an important part even to-day. The use of earthenware and of 
leather in the shaping of masks is characteristic of this area. Here 



ABORIGINAL DECORATIVE ART — KRIEGER 531 

we find a close resemblance in the leather puppets and dance fipurine^ 
used in Java, Siam, Burma, Ceylon, Japan, and China. 

Occasionally the Indian or the primitive Malayan, the Australian, 
or the African did not resort to masks but daubed his face with col- 
ored clay. Perhaps the greatest caricature of a masked human being 
is the Australian who has ceremonially daubed his face and body 
with ochres and clays in readiness for his very serious ceremonies or 
dances. Tribes living in reprions subjected to «rreat drought have 
developed a lore of animal life in the desert. The lowly Bushman 
and the primitive Australian have not advanced beyond the mimicry 
of animal sounds and actions familiar to them. An example of this 
is the dance of native Australian women imitatin*; the jumping; of 
the kangaroo. 

DKCORATIVE AUT OF THIO ESKIMO AND INDIAN TRIBES OB' THE 
PACIFIC NORTHWEST COAST 

FJsJcimo design. — The engraved and carved objects of Eskimoan 
decorative art, characterized by the extensive use of ivory materials, 
has been likened to the art of the Magdalenian culture stage of 
central an»l southern Europe. The answer apparently is that, due to 
the Arctic environment it could not very well be otherwise. "We do 
Icnow, however, tliat the decorative art of the western P^skimo 
merges into that of the Pacific northwest coast Indian tribes. This 
may at once be noted in the realism of animal and human figurine 
carvings in wood and ivory in the two adjoining areas. Masks are 
a characteristic feature of Eskimo art as also of the northwest Pa- 
cific coast. The sculpturing of human features in wood, stone, bone, 
and ivory links up Eskimo art with a larger Pacific coast art area 
extending south as far as San Francisco Bay and central California. 
Representation of totem animals is also characteristic of the two 
areas. This representation is in part realistic and in part symbolic. 
Inci.sed designs on wood, bone, and walrus or fossil mammoth ivory 
characterize similarly tiic art of the western Eskimo and of tribes 
of eastern Siberia. Feather decorations on hoods or coats, also em- 
broidery work in border designs utilizing the hair of the seal are 
noteworthy. 

The earlier geometric art of the Eskimo of Alaska is an offshoot 
of the boreal design area of northern and eastern Canada. The 
curvilinear designs engraved on bone and ivory are generally of the 
double si)iral type of engraved and embroidered designs common to 
Indian tribes from the Xaskapi of Labrador to the Dene of the valley 
of the ^lackenzie. The design is not discontinued there but may be 
traced in beaded moccasin designs of the Tinne of the Yukon Valley 
westward across lieriiig Strait to the Amur River peoples of Siberia 



532 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

where the design is perpetuated in embroidery alone, engraving be- 
coming less common as the distance from the sea and the source of 
suitable material such as walrus ivorj is diminished. There is a 
trace of the spiral and double curve to be found also among the 
wood carving tribes of the Pacific northwest coast, where it vanishes 
before the more powerful zoomorphic totemic design patterns and the 
plastic art of the Pacific coast area characterized by sculptures in 
wood. The realism of Eskimo silhouette engraving is noteworthy in 
that its technic remains simple. The ivory tusk having first been 
softened by immersing in urine, a base line is engraved lengthwise of 
the tusk. Outlines of animal forms, of landscape scenes in silhouette, 
of huts, canoes, and humans in profile are lightly etched. The out- 
lines are filled in with cross hachure, blackened with dirt and grease, 
the whole picture representing a scene from the daily life of Arctic 
America. The figures give a sense of life and mobility. 

Wood carvings in the round. — Carving and modeling in the round 
are peculiarly the achievements of the north Pacific coast and Es- 
kimo tribes. Carving first appears in northern California and be- 
comes more prolific in Oregon, "VVasliington, and British Columbia, 
the Haida of the Queen Charlotte Islands and the Tlingit of south- 
east Alaska being the most adept carvers in wood and horn. 
Great totem poles and house columns are peculiar only to a small 
area of British Columbia and southeastern Alaska, while the ex- 
quisitely carved small horn spoons, images, and countless types of 
carved wooden objects appear from California to Point Barrow. 
Wood becomes scarce and is replaced with ivory north of British 
Columbia, and ivory carving begins with the Tlingit in southeastern 
Alaska and reaches its highest artistic development at the hands of 
the Eskimo on the bleak, barren coast of northwest Alaska. Along 
the eastern stretches of the Arctic in the homes of the central and 
eastern Eskimo their typical arts become marginal and artistic carv- 
ing is less characteristic. 

Decorative art in relief. — Relief carving upon the outside of 
wooden bowls results from an attempt to carry around the walls of 
the vessel definite designs of animals or men in such a way that 
the body of the bowl becomes also the body of the creature whose 
features appear carved on the outer wall surface. When a flat sur- 
face is decorated, the whole figure is spread out upon it. Sometimes 
designs of totemic animals are merely laid out in color and become 
thus more conventionalized. Indian tribes of British Columbia and 
of southeast Alaska practice their decorative art in a more intensive 
way as it is, in part, their expression of beliefs concerning family 
ancestors and culture traditions. North of the Tlingit and south 



ABORIGINAL DECORATIVE ART — KRIEGER 533 

of the Nootka, of VaiR-mivor Ishiiid, vi'>sols iiiay still l)i> carvod in 
the lifelike forms of animals, but are there devoid of rt-liof 
ornamentation. 

A textile center is located anionj,' the Salish tribes of inhiiid 
Washinjjton and British Columbia. Small -icometric fijrures in col- 
ored yarns woven in a twined technic as in the basketry of the Haida 
and Tlin<:^it make up a decorative pattern rcsemblin*; the quilled 
woven bands of the Dene of the adjacent caribou area. The Chilkat 
blanket, woven by the northern coast Tlinojit is decorated more in 
harmony with inland desijjns. Weaving of complex desii,ms in 
twined blankets from patterns painted on wood are characteristic 
of Chilkat textile art. In fact, the weavin«]^ of ^'oat's and dog's hair 
into blankets or robes with decorative design in color not only rivals 
the products of the Navaho and aboriginal Mexican looms, but hints 
at aju'icnt connections with the weaving technic of the south. 

In the National Museum exhibit of Tlingit and Haida costumes 
are large ceremonial blankets of goat's hair such as is being woven 
in the large Chilkat group case; robes of tanned deer skin bordered 
with quilled fringe and superb decoration in color; splendidly 
painted dance aprons trinuncd with fur and fringed with deer 
hoof tinklers; and a woven dance apron trimmed with puffin beaks. 

The house architecture, sculpture in wood, horn, slate, and the 
wood carver's arts of the northwest coast tribes have aroused wonder 
and admiration from the time of their discovery by the Russian 
explorer Bering, who first landed at what is now called Sitka, 
Alaska, in 1741. The earliest account of their peculiar arts dates 
back to descriptions written by Captain Cook in 1778. No mention 
is made by him of ever having observed totem poles, although his 
artist illustrates a house interior showing the great interior liouse 
posts with their carved totemic crests. 

Totemic forms and totem, 'poles. — Nowhere else in the world may 
one find a similar typo of art. It represents for the most part the 
carved figures of animal forms, usually of well-known animals, such 
as the beaver, bear, killer-whale, shark, hawk, eagle, and raven, but 
also of mythical creatures suph as the thunderbird, which makes 
lightning by the flash of its eyes and thunder by the clapping of its 
wings. 

These carved images find expression on the tall wooden totem poles, 
house posts, dugout canoes; in fact, on almost every object of daily 
use from a musical instrument to an artistically carved cooking pot of 
cedar wood. The designs are usually in low relief but are duplicated 
in paintings in native colors on house fronts, on boxes, and in tex- 
tiles and basketry. 
2S095— 31 35 



534 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

The most striking objects on which the native lavishes his best 
artistic efforts are the tall columns of cedar wood familiarly known 
as totem poles, but which are really memorials, erected in honor of 
the maternal brother whose property the builder has inherited. 
These totem poles are carved from the hollowed trunks of the giant 
yellow cedar, and occupy the place of honor at the center of the 
gable end of the owner's house. 

The origin of the arts of the northwest coast Indians has never 
been satisfactorily explained. It has been suggested that they may 
be ascribed to a recent Asiatic influence or to migration of peoples 
from the islands of the south Pacific Ocean, among whom the arts 
of wood-carving are well developed. The extremely mild and humid 
climate of the northwest coast affords perhaps a better clue. At 
Ketchikan, near the southern boundary of southeast Alaska, the 
average annual number of rainy days reaches a total of 235. Dense 
forests of beautiful cedars supply materials for most of the native 
arts and crafts. The fondness of the Indians for working in wood 
becomes almost an obsession with them and finds expression, for 
example, in the long, seaworthy dugout canoes hollowed from a 
single cedar trunk. These boats are constructed with a high prow 
and stern, painted in black, gi*een, or white colors, with representa- 
tions of mythical and realistic animal forms. The birch-bark canoe 
of the northern interior tribes of Canada, or the skin-covered boat 
of the Alaskan Eskimo, is unknown to them. In a similar manner 
do the northwest coast Indians differ in almost every particular 
phase of their daily life from inland Indian tribes of Alaska, British 
Columbia, and the State of Washington on the south. 

The art of the northwest coast Indian is unusual in that the totem 
pole which he erects, is pleasing in itself, although not intended 
primarily to please but rather designed to impress the beholder with 
the owner's greatness or wealth or position in society, and to induce 
respect for himself as the heir of the family crest and totem, all of 
which are expressed on the pole, usually at the base, center, and top. 
The Indian has inherited the right to the crests and totems repre- 
senting the traditional animal protector of his uncle or mother's 
brother, together with his mother's family or clan name and rank. 

Totem pole art is almost entirely a representation of animals. 
These representations refer for the most part to the role played by 
certain animals as actors in native myths. To properly understand 
the carving one must know the story of the myth. Then, to make 
the totem pole art still more abstruse, the Indian artist has certain 
rules of procedure which obtain for him the desired results but which 
make the representation of animals unintelligible to us unless the 
rules are also known.

ABORIQINAX, DECORATIVE ART — KRIEQER 535 

He adds certain parts which convention dictates; or he may sini 
plify and represent oidy what are to him the essential animal parts. 

The curved beak of the hawk is invariably represented as touching 
the mouth on the under side, while the thunderbird, which wears 
a cloud hat, has a larger beak. The raven has a long, straight beak, 
while tiiat of the eagle is short and curved. Birds, even when they 
take human form, are to be recognized by a beak added to an other- 
wise human face. 

The beaver usually has a stick in its mouth, which it holds between 
its paws. The large projecting incisor teeth and scaly Hat tail are 
further characteristics. Certain mythical water monsters may take 
on a variety of forms. Animal representations have erect ears placed 
above the eyes, but are otherwise often difficult to distinguish from 
human figures. Stock objects or fillers-in occupying the spaces on 
the totem pole between the totemic crests are such minor animals as 
frogs and ground worms. 

The bear is usually carved in a sitting position holding a stick 
between his paws while his tongue i)rotrudes from his mouth. 

The shark carvings may be recognized even when rejjrcsented in 
human form by three parallel markings on the cheeks representing 
gill slits. The forehead rises in a triangular-shaped lobe, while 
tlie downward-curved mouth is drawn back exposing sharp tri- 
angular teeth. Other fish are distinguished by their fins. The 
killer whale is characterized by the prominent dorsal fin. 

The most important thing in the life of the Indian is his crest or 
totem. Representations of this animal crest are placed on every 
conceivable object of daily use; they are even tattooed on his arms 
and body and are painted on his face. The inheritance of a proper 
kind of crest or totem determines an individual's chances for suc- 
cess and for a favorable standing in the community. As he inherits 
the crest or totemic animal protector from his mother's male rela- 
tives, he makes it his business to erect a memorial column to his 
maternal uncle as soon as he is financially able to do so. This totem 
pole has carved on it, as mentioned before, the symbolical and often 
di.stoiled or simplified animal figures representing his inherited 
family glory or experience. It may be only after years of saving 
and effort that an Indian is able to erect the column which firmly 
establishes his place in the estimation of his fellows. 

INDIAN ART OF THE EASTERN WOODLANDS AND OF THE WESTERN 

PLAINS 

Design technic of eastern Indians. — As compared with the 
numerous objects now housed in nmseums but originally collected 
among Indian tribes of the western j)lains there is little material 



536 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

extant from Indian tribes of the eastern portions of the United 
States. In the case of the Virginia Indians, the only source of in- 
formation is the meager description left by Capt. John Smith and 
a number of drawings, now preserved in the British Museum, made 
by the artist John White. There is likewise a scarcity of data re- 
garding design motives of all of the eastern Indian tribes. Costumes 
and objects of dress now in the National Museum from Indian tribes 
formerly occupying the region east of the Mississippi River fill 

Simple buckskin garments, coarsely woven cloaks embellished 
but one small exhibit case. 

with turkey feathers and used only in colder weather, moccasins, 
and, in the case of the Gulf State tribes, leggings, fringed girdles, and 
feather-plumed turbans were characteristic objects of dress. Weav- 
ing of bast fiber of basswood and of the mulberry, also of yarn 
fashioned from buffalo hair is said to have been practiced in the 
Lower ISIississippi Valley, where basketry still remains as a live 
weaving technic. Chitimacha basket weavers of Louisiana use spilt 
cane splints in natural straw and in dyed black and red colors. 
Mantles of turkey feathers were plaited in the Southeastern States, 
but were apparently devoid of any attempt at decorative design. 
Fringed buckskin garments, simple beaded designs on moccasins 
and belts, and farther north woven belts and sashes made on an 
upright frame, embroidered bags and pouches decorated with bead- 
work in floral designs, and also body painting and tattooing are 
forms of decorative art inferior to styles and types of ceramics from 
the same area. Subareas of ceramic art are numerous east of the 
Mississippi. 

The dimhle-cuwe motive. — Beads and quills are employed in 
eastern Algonkian designs but in a different manner from that of 
Plains tribes, resulting in a distinct type of design. Instead of rec- 
tangular textile embroidery or angular painted figures, the lines are 
curved and plantlike figures result. This design pattern, known as 
the double-curve motive, is really a double incomplete spiral. Re- 
sembling leaves, plants, and vines, the design is executed on birch 
bark or painted on skins. Painted coat borders of the Naskapi 
Indians of Labrador are a good example of this art, although the 
Montagnais, Micmac, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscot reached the 
same results through quill or moose hair embroideries, bark etching, 
and beadwork, while farther westward the same double-curve pat- 
tern has been adopted by the Cree, the Chippewa, Huron, Sauk and 
Fox, Menominee, Winnebago, and certain of the Plains tribes as the 
Blackfeet. The Iroquois and Delaware Indians, like the western 
tribes just mentioned, used beads and porcupine quills with which to 
embroider similar curvilinear designs. 



ABORIGINAL DECORATIVE ART — KRIEGER 537 

Belts of wampuin, bamls of quill, and moose hair interwoven with 
bast fiber tend to the geometric. The double-curve motive does not 
work well in these materials. There appear to be some distinctions 
between the eastern and the western sections of this area. The 
Dene of the Mackenzie Valley of northern Canada weave rectilinear 
and curved bands of ([uill and moose hair; while the Chippewa of 
Wisconsin and the Menominee weave on a simple frame belts, bags, 
\ind mats incorporating geometric designs. Textiles are elsewhere 
practically nonexistent in the northeastern part of North America. 

Drawing and etching on birchbark became such a highly de- 
veloped art among tribes of the vicinity of the Great Lakes as to 
foiin a system of symbolic or mnemonic pictographic writing, along 
with a decided realistic tendency in beadwork, while in the East, 
freehand double-curve floral figures were embroidered or painted. 
The extreme floral character of some of the beadwork of the Chip- 
pewa has led many to regard the whole as a post-Columbian develop- 
ment. The wide distribution of the Cree and Montagnais, together 
with their very early intimate association w'ith the French colonies, 
presents a favorable condition to rapid difl'usion. Yet, their very 
characteristic double-curve art on bark and painted skins can not 
be attributed to Europeans whose trade stimulated the use of beads, 
wiiile the influence of the old French missions in the Mississippi 
Valley and in Canada is not to be underestimated. There seems not 
the h'ast reason to doubt tliat the very striking lieaded flowei's of the 
West are due to the influence of French mission fathers. 

Pictog-raphic art. — Representative art of the tribes of the region 
surrounding the Great Lakes and also of the Plains tribes, is ex- 
pressed in picture writing. As decorative art the designs show a 
distinctive pattern and conventionalized pictographic devices. Paint- 
ings on muslin cloth supersede the older art of painting on tanned 
hides landscape scenes embodying horses, men, and hunting scenes 
where are shown buffalo. Horse stealing is also a favored theme 
for pictogra})hic or representative decorative art. From the view- 
point of art styles, pictographic or, as we might call it, ideogra[)hic 
ait. has not a high value. The engraved pictographic representa- 
tions on rock cliffs similarly pla<(Ml througliout many of the areas 
of jirimitive art in America and in Oceania have a motivation in 
representative art rathei- tlian in decorative design alone. 

Decorative designs in color are chai'acteristic of fewer areas and 
peoples than is their application of design in relief. Modeling and 
engraving are the early technics of decorative ait. Decorative art 
of Plains tribes consists in the painting of geometric designs on sad- 
dlebags of rawhide, while the tribes of the Pacific noi'thwest coast 
paint toteraic zoomorphic forms on chests and boxes. The Eskimo 



538 AUTNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

use black color as a filler in line cuts to bring out the sharpness in 
their silhouette designs. The same effect is obtained by Papuans 
and Melanesians through the use of white kaolin. 

Limitations imposed on the primitive artist by the materials with 
which he works and the technic which he must employ are potent in 
shaping the style of art. 

Geometric art of the Plains tribes.- — ^ISluch of the decorative technic 
of the Plains tribes consists of bead embroidery, an outgrowth of 
the former widespread use of split quills of the porcupine. The 
most beautiful examples in the National Museum of the use of por- 
cupine quills in embroidery are in the few remaining specimens of 
the Catlin collection obtained by George Catlin from several uni- 
dentified tribes in 1838. The decorative designs embroidered either 
in beads or with porcupine quills are geometric and consist of tri- 
angles and rectangles in varied arrangement of figures and colors. 
The use of the triangle has come to be a distinctive mark of the art 
technic of the Plains tribes. Sometimes this triangle is acute and 
again it is obtuse. When acute it is called a tipi design and fre- 
quently has extended bars reaching beyond the apex. The obtuse 
form has a rectangle inside recalling the stepped insert of the Pueblo 
tribes. Parallel lines of beadwork are interpreted as trails; breaks 
in the trail indicated by colored beads represent camping sites. 

There are considerable tribal differences in the patterns embroid- 
ered as also in the painted designs applied for the most part to raw- 
hide containers, as quivers, saddlebags or parfieches, work boxes, and 
the like. The Sioux are distinguished by their use of the entire field 
as a surface for applying the design. This is especially noticeable 
in the embroidered beaded patterns on moccasins, bags, and pipe 
bags. White beads or a cream-colored paint fill in the background, 
setting off the angular designs. Tlie Arapaho, on the other hand, 
use several small stripes of color covering but a small portion of 
the whole area of the decorated object. The unique spurred acute 
triangle design of the Coman,che is set off at the apex with curved 
hornlike volutes. Plains designs embroidered or painted are both 
realistic and abstract in their meaning. Purely animal forms are 
not painted on rawhide or embroidered in beadwork or quills. Geo- 
graphical features as lakes, mountain passes, rivers, and trails are 
represented even to such details as trees, growing grass, and buffalo. 
To be sure, an interpretation is required to appreciate such realism, 
as buffalo, for instance, are represented by a series of dots boxed in 
a rectangular figure. A mountain pass is the angle between two 
bordering obtuse triangles. 

The Blackfeet are unique in that they attach no symbolism to their 
designs which resemble those of the Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho. 



ABORIGINAL DECORATIVE AUT — KRIEGER 539 

With the Sioux, the picto^raphic designs are symbolic and are 
applied by the men of the tribe, while the women care for the purely 
decorative embollishnionts. Complex (lesi<j:ns are built up from rec- 
tan«:;les, diamonds, triangles, and line patterns. They have names 
which they apply to the designs they make, but the names do not 
signify that the design rei)resents the object named. For example, 
the turtle design does not look like a turtle and does not represent 
a turtle. This design is a conunon one and resembles rakes attached 
at right angles to one another by their handles where they are 
covered with a lozenge-shapeil design. Undoubtedly several formerly 
symbolic devices have deteriorated, and are now applied simply be- 
cause it is the style. Thus, the turtle device much simplitied ap- 
pears as a design embroidereil on the back of a woman's dress, also 
on the front as a U-shaped semisacred device. 

While on the Pacific coast realism tends to express itself in the 
delineation, modeling, or etching of human and animal figures, the 
art of the western plains is characterized by the employment of 
geometric design. Tribes occupying the plateau area beyond the 
Rocky Mountains and east of the Pacific coast tribes, occupy a middle 
fiosition in which geometric designs predominate. Designs formerly 
embroidered with porcupine quills are, since the coming of the 
trader, now worked out in beads. Painted designs appear on raw- 
hide shields, saddle bags, decorative skin and tipi covers, and on 
other materials of rawhide, while the quills of the porcupine are 
sewn on tanned skins in geometric patterns. Use of porcupine quills 
lias not entirely given way to trade beads of glass, but the early 
(luilled, small checker patterns as shown in collections made by Lewis 
and Clarke, by George Catlin, and by the early explorers generally 
have gone. Painted parfleche or saddle bags are still fashioned and 
decorated, and the anrient art has not entirely disappeared from the 
l^lains and plateau tribes. 

Tipi covers are decorated with realistic and symbolic designs such 
as stars or eagles. There is also incised work on wood. 

The Sauk and Fox Indians, like the Plains tribes and the Pueblos 
follow definite patterns in decorating the walls of their rawhide 
vessels. Decoration of the several fields is planned on a yet un- 
folded piece of rawhide. Painted designs, although symmetrical, 
are lost when the rawhide box has been folded. The elements of 
the design, when not hidden by the folding process appear as acute 
triangles with oblique spurs, Maltese crosses, hourglass forms, loz- 
enges, and isolated obtuse triangles. 

Symbolism. — Symbolism includes abstract ideas as well as re- 
ligious motives. Kroeber's study of Arapaho symbolism is im- 
portant in arriving at a conception ol" what, in (he mind of thu prim- 
itive artist, is back of apparently simple geometrical patterns of 



540 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

lines or triangles. Thus a stripe executed in colored beads on the 
uppers of a moccasin shows the destination of the traveler, while 
the beaded heel stripe indicates the place of departure. A white 
border represents snow, while transverse stripes across the instep 
represent hills and valleys. Triangles represent mountains. Sioux 
symbolism is almost identical. This was studied by Wissler. Large 
triangles in applied bead work represent tents ; crossed patterns rep- 
resent arrows or flight of arrows. The double triangle placed back 
to back with another set of two triangles forming a cross is a favor- 
ite Siouan pattern and represents conflict, perhaps between the two 
sets of triangles representing tents. Among the Arapaho, a white 
stripe with dots in it represents a buffalo trail; acute triangles are 
tents, while bordering obtuse triangles represent distant mountains, 
perhaps where dwell the buffalo. The sun shining on a mountain 
might be represented as the top segment of a triangle in yellow 
paint, while the middle or bottom appearing in red color represents 
the ground, and green grass growing on the slopes. A Shoshoni par- 
fleche with a blue central rectangle represents an inclosure sur- 
rounded by an enemy which is represented in red or green outer 
rectangles. Embroideries in beadwork, and paintings on rawhide, 
the first on pouches, pipe bags, work bags, and awl cases, and the 
latter on quivers, work boxes, and saddle bags (parfleches), have no 
apparent distinction as to design. 

Among the Arapaho a cross with scalloped ends represents a star. 
Many other designs resembling a cross also represent a star. The 
same designs when painted with different context may represent 
individuals. Kroeber shows how a diamond-shaped figure might be 
used to represent a turtle, a mountain, a star, an eye, a human being, 
and the navel, or a lake. A rectangle represents a hut, a mountain, 
a camp circle, a buffalo, or the earth. 

A buffalo motive is treated by the Plains Indians in an interesting 
manner. A painting on the tanned surface of a buffalo, calf or 
doeskin is centered with a rectangular device with triangular exten- 
sions at the four opposite corners. Triangles are added oppositely 
at the ends and the representation is complete. This treatment is 
symbolic and signifies the want of more buffaloes for the chase. 

PICTOGRAPHIC AND DECORATIVE DESIGN OF THE NORTHERN AND 
SOUTHERN PLATEAU, AND OP THE PACIFIC SLOPE 

Decorative designs of Indian tribes occupying the high lands west 
of the Rocky Mountains, and the Pacific slope south of the Columbia 
are of interest primarily because of the extreme contrast which they 
represent in the range of aboriginal culture. It has been noted that 
Indian tribes of the plateau region possess a culture type transi- 
tional between that of the Plains and of the Pacific northwest coast 



ABORIOINAXi DECORATIVE ART — KRIEQER 541 

tribes. This is not actually the case as they have absorbed only 
certain types of culture traits from the Plains tribes, and none at all 
from the Pacific coast f^roup. In prehistoric times, before the intro- 
duction of tiie horse in the valley of the Columbia, plateau culture 
resembled that i"epresented until quite recently by the Thompson 
River tribes of inland British Columbia. This culture then repre- 
sented a sinjzle desi<rn area oii«j:inally shared by Shoshonean tribes 
with the Basketmaker, Apache, and Navaho of New Mexico and 
Arizona on the south, and the Californian tribes of the west coast. 
Within historic times. Plains design motives, and design patterns 
have filtered in from the east, while in Arizona and New Mexico 
the developments leading up to the growth of sedentary agricultural 
life of the Pueblo Indians had long been under way. Here, as else- 
where in aboriginal America, were developed ceramic and textile 
arts without apparently any assistance or hindrance from without. 
The nonuidic Navaho and Apache groups disjointedly learned from 
the Pueblos their arts, while the Californian tribes continued until 
historic times to pursue their unique basketry art. No suggestion 
has ever been advanced regarding the borrowing of this art, which 
permeates their entire culture complex, from cooking vessels to 
cradle beds. The twined basketry of the inland Salish is distinct 
in that it is intimately associated with weaving technic, which is not 
practiced by the California tribes. Aboriginal California, except for 
isolated culture influences coming from the north, offers an excel- 
lent example showing how a culture may grow in isolation, the key 
to decorative design being excellence in basketi-y technic. 

Among the basket-nuiking Apache of the Southwest, objects of 
tanned skin decorated with beadwork designs, represent an intrusion 
from the Plains area. Identity between the designs on Apache 
baskets and objects of skin is therefore unusual, the latter being 
borrowed from the Cheyenne or Comanche. Among the Plains 
tribes it was the men who painted robes, tipis, and other skin objects 
with realistic figures, while among the Shoshoni farther to the west, 
both beadwork and basketry were the work of women, who wove 
symbols into their art, although, like most of the Plains tribes, they 
did not decorate pottery. 

Pictographs and petroglyphs are paintings and engraved designs 
occurring on the smooth surfaces of rocky cliffs and boulders. 
Explanation of the GO or more elements of design has been attempted 
many times, but represents merely guesses. They represent, to be 
sure, objects and ideas with which other primitive artists of the 
tribe were acquainted. They do, however, give one a definite clue 
as to the tribe to which the individual belonged; it may be assumed 
that tribal art is always distinctive and characteristic. 

Similarity in ha.sketry^ pottenj^ aiul weaving design technic. — 
There is an observable unity in designs on baskets from Utah and 



542 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

other Rocky Mountain States and on earthenware vessels from 
Arizona and New Mexico. This is readily ascribable to the use of 
checkered and angular devices in the designs of both classes of 
aboriginal objects. To be sure, there is a greater freedom in the 
use of curved and symbolic or realistic designs on Pueblo earthen- 
ware, but fundamentally the designs belong to one area. Even the 
designs woven into the famous blankets of the Navajo fit into the 
type of design, which is fundamentally geometrical. It is interesting 
to note that the pottery technic under discussion is limited in its 
distribution, while the basketry technic is both ancient and more 
widely extended, reaching from one end of the western plateau 
country to the other. It is also interesting to note that the weaving 
technic of the Navajo is a comparatively recent acquisition, reputedly 
having been borrowed from the Pueblo Indians whose weaving tech- 
nic apparently belongs with that of northern Mexico. In Navajo 
and in Pueblo weavings there is embodied a style of geometric art 
design such as might have been borrowed from basketrj'^, but which 
might also have been developed independently. This design, as in 
basketry, is characterized by series of stepped rectangles and by 
diagonal series of small squares and transverse stripes. In the older 
fragments of Pueblo weavings, rescued from cliff dwellings, the 
designs are marginal or consist merely of stripes, the entire field 
being plain. 

Pueblo symholism. — As is well known, the representative as also 
the simply decorative patterns of the Pueblo Indians of Arizona and 
New Mexico are best expressed in painted designs on earthenware 
vessels. These are in part conventionalized and symbolize myth- 
ological and religious motives. The purely decorative earthenware 
designs are in part realistic and in part conventional. Repetition of 
a motive either geometrical, as a spiral meander, or realistic, as birds 
facing each other in inverted form, and with interlocking beaks are 
painted on the inner or outer walls of pottery bowls. The repeated 
use of the eye design in decorative or in symbolic representative art 
is reminiscent of other, unrelated areas. Boas calls attention to a 
Pueblo decorative design consisting of a triangle with rectangles 
attached or inclosed. This pattern occurs on the western plains 
among the Arapaho and other tribes each attaching a distinct mean- 
ing to the design. The Hopi Indians of Arizona substitute the 
semicircle for the triangle, and instead of spurs attach long lines in 
parallel to the base of the design. The semicircles according to the 
Pueblo Indians represent clouds, while the vertical lines represent 
rain. The Shoshoni, Arapaho, and other Plains tribes call the 
angle design a mountain or a mountain pass. The Pueblo apply 
the rain cloud design on earthenware as a painted figure or on wood 
as an altar painting. 



ABORIGINAL DECORATIVE ART — KREEQER 543 

Elaboration of mythological, religious, and symbolic lore into de- 
sign pattern is characteristic of the Southwest. Representations are 
geometrical; motives are usually magical or symbolic. Designs on 
shields of rawhide, on cloth, woven basketry, and on pottery, are no 
less common than are images principally in the form of dolls cut 
from wood. Feather designs are associated with religious practices 
and are not purely decorative. Paintings in clay and on sand are 
I'lso associated with ceremonialism. A borrowing from the cere- 
monial art of the Plains may be seen in a Pueblo painting represent- 
ing a buflfalo stretched out on a tanned doeskin. (Cat. No. 11317, 
U.S.N.M.) It was collected by W. F. Arny, governor of New Mexico 
in 1877. The art pattern is geometrical, being identical with a 
Comanche painting (Cat. No. 6975, U.S.N.M.) of a buffalo applied 
in the same geometrical pattern with lozenge-shaped head, diverging 
horns and a border design of triangles. The painting is in glue 
applied with a stick which rubs the glue into the skin, and when it 
hardens brings the design in relief. The painting is really an altar 
piece representing a prayer for more buffalo. 

Pueblo potter)/. — The repeated invention of pottery making in 
America is no longer open to question. There are, to be sure, cer- 
tain universally diffused steps whereby the earthenware vessels are 
brought to a finished state, similar throughout the entire area of 
pottery manufacture in aboriginal America. Coiling of clay ribbons 
instead of gouging out of the solid mass of clay, for instance, is the 
prevailing method, and has been the prevailing method of pottery 
production throughout the Americas. For that matter coiling has 
l)een the prevalent method everywhere among primitive peoples with 
but few exceptions. 

In the country of the Pueblo Indians, in Arizona and in New Mex- 
ico, the clay is collected from suitable beds and carried to the village. 
It is there worked by the potter into a powder, impurities removed 
and tempering materials such as crushed potsherds or crushed frag- 
ments of mineralized rock added to the powdered clay. The mass 
is then thoroughly mixed and pulverized, and water is added. 

The bottom of the vessel is molded on a solid substance used as a 
foundation. This may be a basket fragment, or a fragment of mod- 
ern crockery. Next are added to the rim of the base a coil or ribbon 
of clay, fashioned by rubbing between the open palms of the potter. 
Successive coils are fitted one above the other and are joined with the 
aid of wet fingers and improvised tools consisting of curved gourd 
fragments each cut to suit the particular curve of the walls desired 
in the vessel to be shaped. The drying process serves also as a test 
of the quality of the paste, as it will not crack while being dried if 
tempering is adequate. Next the ves.sel walls are moistened and 
scraped with bits of sharp stone to remove irregularities, and to 



544 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

reduce portions of the walls to proper thickness. The thoroughly 
smoothed walls are now treated with a slip or several coats of a slip 
consisting of white, yellow, orange, or reddish shades of clay reduced 
with water to a thin paintlike mixture. The slip serves as a back- 
ground for the painted designs to be later applied in colors. Some 
vessels are now burnished with a rounded stone in short rotating 
movements. Fat of sheep or some other form of grease is applied as 
lubricant for the process and as an aid in obtaining a luster. 

The painting of symbolic or of merely decorative designs in colors 
is the most interesting stage in the manufacture of Pueblo pottery. 
Paint brushes of split yucca leaves from which a portion of the 
leaf has been removed leaving a straight edge for line work, are 
commonly used for applying the paint. Most of the colors are ob- 
tained from mineral ochres in shades of red and yellow, and in black 
which is obtained by boiling the juice of the bee plant {Peritoma 
serrulaty/ni) . The ochres are either used raw or are burned. The 
painting is altogether freehand but must follow definite patterns 
well known to all the women who make pottery and also to the men 
who occasionally make pottery vessels. 

After the vessel has been satisfactorily painted the potter piles 
up several newly fashioned vessels in an inverted position and builds 
an oven around them. This consists of dried dung or split cedar wood 
completely covering the vessels to be burned. A hot fire is main- 
tained for the greater portion of an hour when the firing has satis- 
fied the potter. 

In certain cases, when an undecorated ware is to be fired and a 
black color is desired, a smothered fire with plenty of smoke is main- 
tained throughout the firing. Red slip under such conditions turns 
a brilliant black. After firing, the vessels are cleaned with a greasy 
rag. 

The form and design of Pueblo pottery although differing from 
tribe to tribe and from period to period, yet is distinct from that 
of Mexican wares and entirely distinct from the pottery of the 
eastern United States. Perhaps the most distinctive feature about 
Pueblo pottery is the use of paints in conventional designs pertain- 
ing to local mythology. To a much lesser degree are life forms 
molded or luted on to the walls of the vessels or to the handles and 
lids of earthenware vessels. Rims are sometimes shaped into angular 
scallops and are never wavy or boat-shaped as in the eastern pottery 
area. Decorative design often takes the form of eccentric animal 
and human modelings; birds are modeled in more lifelike patterns. 
The painted paneling on the earthenware vessels of the Zuiii separates 
the wall space of earthenware vessels into several divisions on the 
neck and body. Designs painted on the neck space are repeated 
to produce a symmetrical balance. Neck designs consist of volutes 



ABORIGINAL DECORATIVE ART — KUIECJEH 545 

or double curvos rescniblinp those of the eastern woodlands area: 
also of triaiiLdes and lo/.('n<re-shaped fi<jfui"es. and of |)!-ayer-sti(k do- 
si<rns distorted to lit the spaee. On the body of the vessel appear in 
eombination certain fifrnres as that of a deer and a rosette r('|)iesen(- 
in^ a sunflower. There thev are re))eated in a manner showing an 
appreciation for the symmetrical disposition of space. There may 
be another encircling: panel filled with an interlockin*; scroll of 
inverted or interlockin<; conventionalized biids. A series of thvee 
rectan<:u!ar ste])s or terraces may he substituted for tiie deer, sun- 
flower, and bird-desio^n patterns. 

THE WEST INDIES. MEXICO. AND SOUTH AMKRU'A 

When C'oluml)us first eiicountereil American natives on one of the 
Bahama Islands he met with the most northern of the South Amer- 
ican tribes. The prehistoric inhabitants of the Bahama Islands 
were Arawaks who had followed the island chain northward from 
the Venezuelan coast. Their culture was a meager one, perhaps 
much more so on the part of the Bahamans than on the larger 
islands of Haiti and Cuba where stone carving and woodworking 
rivaled in excellence the various types of freehand modeling of life 
forms in earthenware. 

The Indian tribes of northern Mexico are adept at the weavers 
art and embroider designs based in part on native and in part on 
Spanish patterns. Geometrical devices and animal forms essentially 
native combine with heraldic patterns. The conveying of ideas 
is at the bottom of much pictographic or representative art of 
Mexican tribes. This, however, does not lessen the value of the 
ornamentation. 

Mexican art area. — Ancient Peru and ancient Mexico produced and 
maintained dense populations at various centers, but round about 
these centers were lesser populations occupying marginal positions. 
Among the Huichol Indians weaving incorporates designs having 
marked realistic tendencies. Modern textile art from the Rio 
Grande to Panama shares this train of realism in design. There is 
a general similarity to Peruvian conventionalization of its art de- 
signs. According to early Spanish authorities the Mayan peoples 
were the most expert weavers in New Spain. Contact with the 
Spanish altered to a certain extent the design but the old resem- 
blance remains with the Andean highlands. Pottery likewise sur- 
vives only through archeological studies, extensive collections reveal- 
ing painted designs. Painted designs and modeling of embellish- 
ments in relief here take the place of mere pueblo designs. In the 
Panama area, including Costa Rica, and the Chiri(|ui district of 
Panama, we have complex designs of animal and reptilean forms 



546 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 ' 

recalling textile and Peruvian art designs. Mayan textilelike de- 
signs for mosaic and stucco work are striking exceptions to the rule 
that realistic carving and design prevail. 

South American art areas. — Aboriginal textiles from the Inca 
region of Peru have been preserved in great abundance in the rarefied 
dry climate of the Peruvian highlands. These show complex color 
designs producing realistic designs of men, birds, cats, fish in more 
or.less conventionalized form, all with the geometrical basis of loom 
weaving. 

There is a superior development of earthernware decoration 
incorporating life forms in jars representing persons, birds, monkeys, 
fishes, plants, as corn, potatoes, peanuts, gourds, and others. Deco- 
rations are in color and in incised work. In color the Nasca and 
Titicaca Avare is superior to anything yet discovered in the New 
World. The painted designs upon this pottery are comparable to 
those upon cloth in their realistic tendencies. Certain fixed con- 
ventional forms appear both on pottery and cloth. 

As we go out from Peru in both directions pottery decoration 
becomes inferior. Historical relations of this center with adjoining 
regions have not as yet been worked out. 

This Andean highland culture spreading northward west of the 
Rocky Mountains and southward along the western slope of the 
Andean ranges is the true home of a most characteristic and the 
highest development of art form and design in the Western Hemi- 
sphere. There is no possibility of direct connection between this 
peculiar development and other art centers in Oceania or on any of 
the continental masses of the Old World. 

The geographical center of this great American development is 
furthest removed from any possible contact with peoples from other 
continents, the only possible routes of entry into America being the 
Aleutian Islands south of the Bering Sea, and the islands of the 
Bering Sea itself, and the more scattered islands of the south Pacific. 
None of these were favorable routes for entry of ready made art 
complexes. The infiltration of peoples must have been painfully 
slow, perhaps occurring but once in the entire geographic history. 

On the other hand one can not ignore certain parallelisms of de- 
velopment in the arts of tropical peoples of Oceania and South 
America. Similarly one can not ignore a certain parallelism between 
the high achievements of the Inca, the Aztec, and the Maya on the 
one hand, with the Egyptian and Asiatic cultures on the other. An- 
other parallelism, that of cultural types, Melanesian and lowland 
South America might be placed alongside the observed parallelism 
between New Guinea, Maori, and north Pacific coast cultures. There 
is also something to be said for parallelism in African design with 
that of eastern America. Similarly one might point out more gen- 



ABORIGINAL DECOBATIVE ART KRIEGER 547 

eralized parallelisms that prevail practically throughout the entire 
world where there can be no possibility of migration of j)ooples or 
even of the art designs themselves. The use of the spiral, in fact of 
all the elementary forms of incising, the many forms of simple 
Crosshatch, etched or painted, the many synibols of motion widely 
known as swastika, and in weaving, the application of certain geo- 
metrical designs are found wherever a basket is woven or wherever 
a piece of cloth is produced. The widespread diffusion of geometrical 
designs on tapa cloth or on bark clotli are purely environmental in 
their distribution. In a similar way the beginnings of plastic art 
and of sculpturing in wood and in clay are distril)Uted. 

Hundreds of examj)les might be selected which first appear to 
show a culture connection. All these must be discarded as examples 
of pseudo-culture diffusion in that the very arts themselves, of weav- 
ing, of pottery making, of wood carving, and of many other crafts 
when perfected, lend themselves readily to a display of similar forms 
of surface finish and embellishments. 

Such is the beginning of primitive art. Although widespread in its 
various presentations, it began in a thousand places when the prim- 
itive craftsman began to realize his power over material. As soon 
as he began to play with his technic he became a primitive artist 
as well as a primitive artisan.

J. H. Clark. The engraved and flat-relief patterns resemble in part the 
double-curve motive of eastern Algonkian art, and in part the geometrical, 
acute triangular designs of the Plains tribes. Art designs generally pre- 
valent among the Chippewa, Menominee, Winnebago, and other western Great 
Lakes tribes are transitional between floral, curvilinear motives of the eastern 
woodlands tribes and the geometrical art of the Indian tribes of the Plains.

In shaping rawhide it is folded and sewn while yet plastic; fringed 
flaps are inserted and sewn to the side«, while the cover llap may either 
be sewn on or merely a folded section. Triangular painted devices when 
acute may represent tipis, when obtuse, they may represent mountains 
or mountain passes, streams, etc., but are devoid of meaning among some of 
the northern Plains tribes as among the Blackfeet. Rectangles, triangles, 
spurs, serrations, rake devices, series of dots are given different inter- 
pretations by the various tribes who recognize the symbolism of such 
devices. Thus a series of dots in color may represent a herd of buffalo, 
a stream, or a trail.

big hern, sheep, deer, flying geese, snakes, bear tracks, bird tracks, sheep 
horns, and turtle, along with geometric devices such as dots, stars, cogged 
wheel, cross, concentric circle.s, wavy or zigzag lines, spirals, connected circles, 
which arc sometimes bisected, circular gridirons, cross hachure, angular 
meander, diamond or lozenge-shaped figures, ladder, and mazes of .several

Lower figure : A carved and painted wooden chest. This box is typical 
of carved and decorated wooden chests fashioned by the northwest Pacific 
coast Indian tribes and used by them as containers of various objects. The 
chest is made from a cedar slab grooved on the inner face at proper inter- 
vals, bent to a rectangular shape, the ends pegged and a bottom and top 
supplied. It is decorated by surface painting, by shallow intaglio carving, 
also by relief carving. The designs are of totemic animals wonderfully 
analyzed into conventional decorative designs representing totemic forms 
as in the woven Chilkat blankets. Frequently the smaller chests are 
secured with an ornamental lacing of cedar bark cord. Sometimes bark 
mats are wrapped around them before the cords are applied. The carved 
wooden boxes are intended to contain food or valuable belongings of the 
household.

which appear in perspective, framing a modern cribbage board, one of 
the favored commercial objects offered to the trade by the modern Alaska 
Eskimo. 



ABORIGINAL DECORATIVE ART — KRIEQER 553 

The environment of the Alaskii west coast Eskimo limits their choice 
of materials suitaldt' for picto^'rapliic and (lecorative art. From tlie be- 
pinuin^ of their occupancy of Alask;i, the Esliirao engraved geometric 
dosipis on hone, ivory, and to a lesser extent on wood. Carvinj; in the 
rouiKi in a highly realistic niaimer, althou;;h praiticed to a more limited 
defiree, was no less successful, remlndlnR one in this respect of the art of 
the northwest coast of British Columhia and of southeast Alaska. Em- 
broidered desl^s were applied on skin garments by the southern Eskimo 
and by the Aleut. 

Early designs were more curvilinear than are the more modern spurred 
and angular engraved patterns. ReiM>atcd use of the eye motive of the 
northwest coast tribes points to an early connection between these coast 
peoples, which was only reci'ntly broken off by the intrusion of the 
Athapascans. There is furthermore in these early attempts at decorative 
art a striking similarity to the incomplete double volutes and double curves 
of the Aainu of northern .Japan, and of the Siberian tribes.

Plate 22 

Decorated coiled baskets of the Pomo Indians, Mendocino County, Callt. Orna- 
mentation effecteil principally through sewing in of white shell beads, downy 
tufts of woodpecker feathers, and in weaving patterns in colored (black) bas- 
ketry splints to form geometrical designs symbolizing various life forms. The 
Pomo attach a meaning to the ornamental structure. The same may be said 
for the designs of the Salish tribes of British Columbia and for tl)e symbolic 
ornamentation on the basketry of the Alaska Tlingit Indians, although the 
Ha Ida do not attach much importance to their decorative devices on twined 
basketry. The beautiful examples of Pomo coiled ba?ketry shown are built up on 
either a single or 3-rod foundation, are sewn with split sedge root and the stems 
of tiny feathers are caught under the stitches. Colors are obtained through 
use of several kinds of bird feathers, as the red from the woodpecker, green 
from the mallard duck, orange from the oriole, yellow from the meadow lark, 
black from quail. In the shell pendants variety In colors is derived from the 
tinted abalone and the white clam.

religious practices. The patterned beadwork on leggings and tlie peculiar 
cut of the moccasin last which is recurved at the toe end and expanded to 
a button-shaped knob, as also the several styles of baskets shown, fully 
illustrate the art and arts of the nomadic Apache.

Painted altar of tanned doeskin. Pueblo Indians of New Mexico. 

This example of southern Plains Indian art was collected from the 
Pueblo Indians by Gov. W. F. M. Arny in 1877. It resembles in structure 
and details of design, a psiinted symbol of Comanche origin. The painted 
design of a buffalo is spread out on a tanned doeskin. A lozenge-shaped 
figure represents the head, recurved diverging horns, several comblike, or 
rakelike figures and painted triangles make up the design. A spurred 
border in particular resembles the corresponding sacred device of the 
southern Plains tribes, notably the Comanche. The design is applied with 
sticks dipped in glue, which is well rubbed into the tanned skin. When it 
hardens, the design is brought into relief. Cat. No. 11317, U.S.N.M, 

Plate 26 

Mexican and Pueblan textile designs. A woven serape and ceremonial kilts. 

Above: Designs incorporating the symbolism of the Hopi. This con- 
sists of stepped triangles and of pendent parallel lines. This is the so- 
called rain cloud design and reappears in several patterns due to the need 
for conformity with the borders of the textile into which the pattern has 
been woven. A rounded, dome-shaped figure frequently appears instead 
of the triangular device, which is similar to the triangular pattern used 
in the symbolism of the Plains tribes. Below : The Saltillo serape is 
perhaps the finest example of weaving and of woven decorative design 
known from aboriginal American tribes. The woven blankets of the 
Salish, of the Chilkat, and of the Navaho are close seconds so far as per- 
tains to design alone, but are inferior in weaving technic. Except for the 
yoke pattern, in the example shown, there has been woven throughout, a 
series of small, lozenge-shaped figures. Other examples of Saltillo scrapes 
Incorporate series of small, hour-glass figures in continuous panels. The 
art of weaving scrapes on native Mexican looms has all but become extinct 
and the few known examples of this textile art are valued highly. 

Plate 27 

Decorated earthenware bowls of the Pueblo Indians of Zuni, N. Mex. The 
painting of decorative or of symbolic designs in colors has been carried 
out to an extent far superior to weaving or basketry technic within the area 
occupied by the Pueblo Indians. Paint brushes of split 3mcca leaves are 
commonly used in applying the paint. Before painting on the designs the 
surface of the vessel has been treated with a slip consisting of white, orange, 
or yellowish clays reduced with water. This priming coat serves as a back- 
ground for the painted designs to be applied. Colors for the paints are de- 
rived from plants as the bee plant {Peritoma serrulatum) which produces 
a brilliant black, or ochres in shades of red and yellow. 

Use of paints in conventional designs pertaining to local mythology is 
more common than is the painting on of life motives in eccentric or in 
realistic form. The Zuni potter separates the available wall space into

THE ACCLBIATIZATION OF THE WHITE RACE IN 

THE TKOriCS' 



Bv RouratT I)K ('. Wai:i) 



The acclimatization of (he white race in the Tr()i)ics is a question 
which is hir^el}' medical in many of its aspects. I wish to make it 
clear that I write wholly as a layman in so far as the medical side 
of ni}' topic is concerned. The subject, however, also very distinctly 
concerns the climatolo^nst. It is from the cliinatolo<iical, rather than 
from the medical, side that I propose to treat it. The problem is one 
the solution of which — if there be a solution — requires the close 
cooperation of medical men and of cIimatolo<^ists. The study of the 
physiolofpcal effects of tropical climates, and of tropical diseases, is 
the responsibility of the medical man. On the other hand, it is the 
business of the climatologist to set forth, in the greatest possible de- 
tail, all the characteristics of tropical climates, and, if the picture is 
not sufficiently complete or satisfactory for the purposes of the 
physician, to take steps to make it more so. While much work, and 
very excellent work, has been done by investigators of many national- 
ities, in many parts of the Tropics, there still remain great gaps in our 
knowledge which must be tilled before our conclusions can be consid- 
ered wholly sound, or final. 

To my own thinking, there are few more interesting problems 
awaiting study on the part of medical investigators than those that 
relate to the physiological effects of tropical climates on white men 
and women, and especially on children. Such studies should by no 
means be limited .sim]:)ly to the ordinary physical changes in the body. 
They should especially be extended to cover the nervous system and 
the mental effects. Incomplete as our present knowledge of tliis prob- 
lem is, it is neverthele.ss possible for us to present certain fairly well 
ascertained facts. It is these that I wish to consider, always remem- 
bering that the future may very considerably change our present 
views, and that many phases of the acclimatization problem arc very 
recent. The attention of the medical profession has naturally and

properly been more concerned with the study of specific causes of 
tropical diseases than with the general physiological eifects of tropi- 
cal climates. 

The acclimatization of the white race in the Tropics is a question 
of vast importance. Upon it depend the future settlement, control, 
government and utilization of the Tropics. It is becoming more im- 
portant with the passing of the years. The increasing pressure of 
population in Europe demands an outlet. The need of an additional 
food supply in the not far distant future is turning our attention 
more and more toward the hot belt of the world. Tropical products, 
like coffee, rubber, quinine, spices, fruits, and lumber are desired in 
ever-increasing quantity. The land areas within the Tropics are to 
a large extent under the control of extra-tropical nations, as colonies, 
or protectorates, or possessions of one sort or another. The future 
more and more looks toward the Tropics. And what becomes of the 
Tropics is for the white man to decide. 

This problem is of concern to many. It interests the statesman, 
whose responsibilities include relations with tropical countries; the 
economist, who concerns himself with laws of population and with 
food supply; the medical man, whose business it is to fight disease 
and to improve conditions of health all over the world; the clima- 
tologist, whose intimate study of tropical climates is essential to any 
thorough understanding of tropical problems ; the "engineer, geolo- 
gist, or business man whose livelihood is to be gained in tropical 
countries. 

The literature is already very extended. We Americans are apt 
to forget that people of our own blood, of the British Isles, have had 
many long years of intimate contact with the Tropics, and have made 
many important studies of the experience of their troops and of their 
civilians in hot countries. France has had her own dealings with 
the Tropics, in Africa and in the Far East. Germany, also, more re- 
cently, chiefly in Africa, accumulated information along the same 
lines. 

One of the very natural misconceptions of a layman is that the 
climates of the whole tropical zone are in all respects alike. This is 
by no means the case. There are, in reality, three logical subdivisions 
of that zone : The equatorial belt, the trade wind belts, and the mon- 
soon belts. In each of these there are modifications due to oceanic 
and to continental influences. Further, the effect of altitude is so 
important that another subdivision should be added to include moun- 
tain climates. All parts of the hot zone are not equally disagreeable 
or hostile, so far as occupation by the white race is concerned. 

The tropical zone includes extended deserts over the continental 
areas in the latitudes of the trade winds ; immense expanses of damp 
forests and jungles and swamp land in the vicinity of the equator; 



WHITE RACE IN THE TKOPICS — WARD 559 

fertile islands, refreshed by cool steady winds from the ocean; <;reat 
grass lands with one season of dronght and dust and another season 
of dampness, of rains, and often of floods; the monsoon districts, 
with their climatic control alternately that of the wet monsoon and of 
the dry monsoon; the mountains and plateaus with their lower tem- 
peratures and, if rising high enough, carrying snow the year around, 
even on the ecjuator. This variety of climates makes it diflicult to 
arrive at general conclusions for the lower latitudes as a whole. Each 
type of climate has advantages and each has disadvantages for the 
white settler. The deserts are free from many tropical diseases, their 
parched soil and dry, sterile air being unfavorable to the development 
and distribution of most mic-i-oorganisms and of disease-bearing in- 
sects. Further, the general physiological effects of desert climates are 
stimulating. They do not have the weakening and enervating effects 
associated with the hot-house air of the latitudes nearer the etiuator. 
The drier districts are, on the whole, to be preferred to the moister. 
On the other hand, the dust and heat and brilliant sunshine are very 
trying, and the lack of water is obviously a serious limitation to 
settlement and agricultural development. Tropical deserts are 
'• healthy " in the ordinary meaning of the term, but they are not 
desirable places of residence for white settlers. 

Tropical islands in the trade winds, especially those toward the 
margins of the tropical zone, like the Hawaiian Islands, are generally 
regarded as far more desirable places of residence for white men and 
women than are the continental areas, especially those near the 
equator. Trade wind islands are still more desirable if they are 
mountainous, and therefore offer the advantages of tempered heat. 

Wherever mountains and plateaus occur in the Tropics there is 
general agreement that the climatic conditions, at least up to a height 
of a few thousand feet, are more favorable for the white settler than 
are the hotter, damp lowlands. Altitude is chiefly important because 
of its effect in tempering the heat, especially at night. In India the 
hill sections are crowded during the hot months by civilian and mili- 
tary officials, and it has been well said that India is ruled from 7,000 
feet above sea level. The climate of many tropical plateaus and 
mountains has the reputation of being a " perpetual spring." Thus, 
on the interior plateaus of the tropical Cordilleras of South America 
and on the eastern plateaus of Africa the heat is greatly tempered by 
the altitude, while the lowlands and coasts are very hot. A list of 
the better portions of the Tropics for white settlement always in- 
cludes the plateaus of the Andes, of eastern equatorial Africa, and of 
South Africa; the Indian hill stations, and the Hawaiian and other 
trade wind islands. To this list, many other places might easil}' be 
added. Lord Bryce believed that Rhodesia will become the home 
of a settled British population, where the race will renew itself from 



560 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 

generation to generation, but the climate of this elevated region is 
very different from that of the hot and moist latitudes along the 
equator. Yet tropical mountains and plateaus lack one feature of 
essential importance. They ma}', perhaps rightly, be said to have a 
" perpetual spring," but they lack distinct seasonal variety. They 
lack the tonic of a cold winter. Their temperatures are, it is true, 
lower than those nearer sea level, but although the temperature scale 
is lower, the same monotonous succession of notes is played upon it. 
They are temperate in the sense of having tempered heat. They are 
not " temperate " in the sense that they have temperate zone charac- 
teristics of distinct seasonal variety; of constantly fluctuating 
weather changes ; of the alternation from warmer to colder winds, 
and from storm to fine weather. Tropical mountains and plateaus 
have monotony ; a monotonous repetition of the same weather. That 
is the secret of their failure in solving the problem of acclimatiza- 
tion. They do offer immunity from certain tropical diseases. They 
fail to provide the " spur of the seasons " to which we are accus- 
tomed in temperate latitudes. The nonseasonal character of tropical 
climates — the so-called " perpetual spring " — is not by any means the 
best fitted for man's mental or physical development, however pleas- 
ant it may be for a time. Many tropical hill and plateau stations 
are beneficial in restoring those exhausted by overwork or by the 
heat of the lowlands. They are especially advantageous in the cases 
of white women and children. Nevertheless, climates temperate 
because of altitude can not replace climates " temperate " because of 
latitude. 

In the problems of acclimatization and colonization in the Tropics 
cur concern is chiefly, although not by any means solely, with the hot, 
damp, and rainy climates found generally in the latitudes near the 
Equator: The climates of the Amazon and Congo forests, for ex- 
ample ; of the west coast of Africa and of northern South America ; 
of the typical tropical jungles ; of the steamy oppressive "hot-house" 
type. It is in these more or less constantly wet climates that we 
find the wealth of tropical products which chiefly attracts the white 
man. It is here that, on the whole, there are the greatest possibilities 
for future food supply. The economic return is mainly from the 
damp lowlands, and not from the deserts or from the high plateaus 
and mountains. It is fairly safe to say that it is specifically the 
rainy low-latitude type of climate which promises the greatest po- 
tential agricultural resources, and also presents tlie most serious 
handicap to white settlement. It is with this climate that the prob- 
lem of acclimatization is mainly concerned. 

In the minds of most people the acclimatization problem is merely 
a question of whether a single white man or woman can live for a 
time in a tropical climate in reasonable comfort and with a fair 



WHITE RACE IN THE TROPICS — WARD 561 

chance of good health. But the question is a far larger one than 
that. It concerns not one individual alone, nor even one generation 
alone. Tiie real problem is this: Can men and women of the white 
race immigrate in large numbers to the moist hot Tropics and live 
there on the same high plane of civilization as that characteristic of 
their former homes, retaining their physical health and vitality, 
their mental and moral standards, and reproducing their own kind^ 
Further, can future generations of white people, born in the Tropics, 
maintain, in the years to come, these same standards of civilization 
and of physical, mental, and moral vigor il This, it will be observed, 
is a very much larger, more complex, and more fundamental question, 
but it is tlje real crux of the whole matter. And this much larger 
(juestion is, at present, very difficult, if not altogether impossible, to 
answer on the basis of known scientific facts. 

The health relation of the white race in tropical clinuites is be^t 
considered from two points of view, first, the general one of tropical 
diseases, and second, the one that concerns the effects of physiological 
disturbances without always, or necessarily, involving specific disease. 

It is not for the layman, without professional knowledge of medi- 
cal science, to attempt any technical discussion of tropical diseases. 
He may, however, consider some of the obvious facts without com- 
mitting himself in regard to details which do not properly fall in his 
own field of scientific study. 

Certain diseases are so much at home in the Tropics that they have 
come to be known as tropical diseases. This designation does not 
imply that some of them may not, and do not, occur in extratropical 
latitudes when conditions of climate, traffic, unsanitary mode of life, 
absence of proper medical supervision, and so on, favor such oc- 
currence. There is greater variety in tropical than in extratropical 
disease, but tlien, many diseases common in cooler latitudes i)revail 
also near the Equator, and many are found in low latitudes which have 
been practically or altogether banished from higher latitudes. Again, 
certain diseases even in the Tropics, as is well known, e. g., in the case 
of yellow fever, have been hemmed in more and more by modern 
sanitary measures. Several conditions are at work in favoring the 
widespread prevalence and in determining the large number of trop- 
ical diseases. Among these three may here be mentioned : The agency 
of tropical insects and parasites in propagating or in transmitting 
the disease geiin ; tlie general weakening effect of the steady, damp 
beat upon the human body, and the excessively unhygienic modes of 
life of the natives. The tropical climate is not the sole, or even in 
many cases the determining factor, yet certain high temi)eratures 
are necessary for the occurrence and spread of malaria and yellow 
fever, for example, and the agency of the tropical fauna, whose re- 
quirements are the presence of known conditions of heat and of 



562 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

moisture, is of fundamental importance in many cases. As the late 
Sir Patrick Manson pointed out, many years ago, in his famous work 
on tropical diseases, the term " tropical diseases " does not mean 
diseases confined to the Tropics. It was employed by him in a meteor- 
ological sense for diseases associated with, but not solely or even di- 
rectly due to high temperatures. Tropical climatic conditions, per se, 
it may be noted in passing, probably do not injuriously affect the 
natives of the Tropics any more than do the conditions of extratrop- 
ical climates affect us who live in them. Most tropical diseases attack 
both natives and whites; sometimes the former suffer most; some- 
times the latter. There is no rigid hard-and-fast rule. The racial 
element is, however, often potent. Finally, great numbers of tropical 
natives have inevitably, in the long succession of generations, become 
more or less immune to the attacks of disease against which the whites 
have not yet developed immunity. 

Leaving these broad generalizations, let us turn next to a brief 
consideration of a few of the more important tropical diseases. In 
addition to the more or less direct effects of exposure to tropical sun- 
sliine, dampness and heat, such as sunstroke, heat exhaustion and the 
like, there are malaria, and dysentery in various forms, doubtless the 
two worst enemies of white residents in the Tropics; sleeping sick- 
ness ; tropical abscess of the liver ; hookworm and other intestinal par- 
asitical infectious fevers of different kinds ; ulcers and other infections 
of the skin; many infectious diseases common to colder as well as 
warmer latitudes, and other ailments that chiefly attack the natives, 
and are therefore of a medical rather than of a practical interest in 
our present consideration. Yellow fever, cholera, and plague are 
very greatly limited, and are being more and more successfully over- 
come as the result of modern sanitary measures. 

Twenty years ago Sir Ronald Ross wrote of malaria, " I venture to 
say that it has profoundly modified the history of mankind by doing 
more than anything else to hamper the work of civilization in the 
Tropics," During the two decades that have elapsed since that state- 
ment was made, the campaign against malaria has accomplished 
remarkable results, both in prevention and in treatment ; yet it is 
safe to say that malaria still remains one of the most destructive 
diseases in the world. Rough estimates — the only ones that are pos- 
sible at present — indicate that about one-third of the population 
throughout the Tropics suffers from it constantly. The malarial zone 
is a broad band within the moist Tropics, extending at times into the 
margins of the adjoining temperate zones. The disease is absent, or 
infrequent, in deserts and steppes, and on mountains at moderate 
elevations above sea level. It is perennial in its zone of maximum 
frequency, but has a general tendency to rise to a peak in the warmer 
or rainy season. Even in the early days of medical investigation into 



WHITE RACE IN THE TROPICS — WARD 563 

tlie orifjiii and conditions of malarial infection, a close relation 
between temperature and the occurrence of malaria was observed, so 
distinct that from then on the line of a mean annual temperature of 
60° F. hfis l)een considered as markin<j: the polar boundaries of recog- 
nized malarial infection, ami winter cold has been seen to be the great 
barrier against the occurrence and spread of the disease. Rainfall 
is important because the malaria-bearing mosquito passes one stage 
of its life in water. Hence lakes, and especially marshes, pools, and 
swamps are critical as breeding places of the mosquitoes. Digging 
up the soil results in hollows where puddles and pools may collect. 
In early days, it was believed that stirring up the soil gave rise to 
certain no.xious exhalations from the ground, and that these vapors 
or gases produced the disease. It is easy to see how that belief 
originated, and why it persisted until medical science wholly dis- 
proved it. 

Tropical dysentery " slays outright, and makes miserable wrecks 
of white men in the Tropics," as a recent writer has put it, doubtless 
without exaggeration. Dysentery has its real home in tropical 
climates, and increases in severity and in frequency with approach to 
the Equator. Some form of it is always present in low latitudes, 
and it is there next in importance to malaria in causing high death 
rates, and in its lasting effects. In contrast with the case of malaria 
and of yellow fever, altitude can not be relied on to give relief. 
Residents on mountains sometimes suffer more than do those at lower 
levels. 

The species of tsetse fly associated with sleeping sickness requires 
a warm, damp atmospliere, and the immediate presence of water. 
The limit of its altitudinal range is about 4,000 to 5,000 feet. It is 
found in the true equatorial forests where there is water, and also 
extends into the adjacent grasslands where there are groups of trees. 
Sleeping sickness occurs over a vast area in tropical and subtropical 
Africa. There it causes high mortality, a decreased birtii rate, and 
is a serious menace to the existence of a large population. In con- 
sequence of its ravages, the labor supply is being diminished, and the 
economic development of the country is being retarded. 

Because of its inevitable enervating and enfeebling effects, hook- 
worm is another tropical and subtropical disease which is a very 
serious menace in many places. The economic loss is very heavy, 
perhaps even heavier than that caused by malaria. It has been esti- 
mated that between GO and 80 per cent of the population of India 
harbor the parasite. 

Yellow fever, formerly widely prevalent along the tropical shores 
of Latin America, and occasionally even invading our Gulf coasts, 
now has its last stronghold in western equatorial Africa, where such 
splendid work, unfortunately accompanied by the loss of valuable 



564 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

lives, has been carried on for some years by the Rockefeller Institute 
for Medical Research. An outbreak of yellow fever in Brazil during 
the summer of 1928 showed that South America is not yet safe 
from this disease. Definite temperature controls over the occurrence 
of yellow fever have long been known, and stated in specific num- 
bers of degrees of the thermometer scale, and the disappearance of 
epidemics when the freezing point is reached was noted several 
decades ago. 

Sunstroke and heat prostration, as is to be expected, are most com- 
mon in the Tropics. Exposure to the sun does not always explain 
sunstroke, for at sea the tropical sun is much less fatal than on land, 
and places with apparently similar conditions of sunshine differ much 
as regards prevalence of sunstroke. The story is told of a planter 
from Barbados who had gone to live in Madras, and who insisted on 
riding horseback in the sun as he had been accustomed to do in 
Barbados. He laughed at friends who warned him against running 
this risk, and lost his life by sunstroke. At Panama there were only 
two deaths from sunstroke and 21 cases of heat exhaustion in a popu- 
lation of 120,000, in 13 years. In Liberia, on the other hand, it has 
been pointed out by Dr. C. F. Brooks that in climatic conditions on 
the coastal lowlands much like those of the Atlantic coast of Panama, 
manual labor such as is performed by white men in Panama is im- 
possible, and only a few minutes' exposure is enough to give " a touch 
of the sun." It has been suggested that an explanation may perhaps 
be found in the fact that in Panama protection against the sun is 
provided by a moist layer of air which extends to great heights, 
Avhile in Liberia the moist layer is relatively thin. Very damp air, 
combined with strong sunshine, induces heat exhaustion at fairly 
moderate temperatures, and most damp lowlands in the Tropics are 
dangerous for white men who are doing manual labor, or who have 
their heads unprotected. Apparently, either intense sunshine alone, 
or very damp air alone, is not dangerous. It is the combination of 
the two that brings fatal results. On the wharves of Calcutta there 
used, to be painted, in large white letters, the significant warning, 
" Beware of the sun," so that persons coming there for the first time 
from the British Isles would read those words before they set foot on 
shore. " Beware of the sun " is a good rule for the Tropics. There 
is, in general, too much sunshine in the Tropics. The skin of white 
persons exposed to the sun there often becomes badly burned and 
blistered, and travelers commonly suffer because of lack of protec- 
tion of neck and limbs under the hot tropical sun. 

The second aspect of the health and acclimatization of the white 
race in the Tropics concerns the physiological disturbances. While 
the separation of the effects of physiological disturbances from 
specific diseases is difficult, and may, from a strictly medical point of 



"WHITB RACE IN THE TROPICS — WARD 565 

view, even be impossible, nevertheless there is a line of demarcation 
between the two, however faint it may be, and however difficult it 
may be to draw. 

The uniformly hiprh temperatures of (he Tropics — llie well-known 
tropical monotony of heat — when combined with hiph humidity and 
the characteristically small variability of temperature from day to 
day, have certain already fairly well re^o^ized physioloj^ical effects, 
although definite numerical measurements are still lo a lar«i:e extent 
not yet available, and much of the evidence is conflictin<2:. On the 
basis of recent studies, the body temperature seems, in general, to 
be essentially the same as elsewhere when the body is at rest, but 
with exercise it rises more rapidly than in cooler climates, and also 
falls more slowly. Much exercise has the same effect as a mild fever. 
The respiration rate is hiirh, probably because of the body's attempt 
to increase evaporation and so to reduce its temperature. There is 
evidence to indicate that evaporation from lungs and skin is far 
more concerned in controlling the body temperature than is chem- 
ical activity. The blood pressure apparently shows no permanent 
change, but there seem to be greater temporary variations after 
exercise than is the ca^e in temperate climates. As regards the 
composition of the blood, there is a slight relative decrease in the 
number of red corpuscles, but the specific gravity shows no change 
except in disease. It appears that the popular belief in a " thinness 
of the blood " after prolonged residence in the Tropics is unfounded, 
except, as just stated, in the case of disease or of anemia. Perspira- 
tion is profuse. There is, in general, an increased activity of the 
liver, kidneys, and spleen, as contrasted with an increased activity 
of the organs of respiration in higher latitudes. It would seem that 
when the white man goes to live in the Tropics his first functional 
disturbances are likely to be in the intestinal organs, and may 
predispose to dysentery or other dangerous diseases. Per contra, 
when human beings or animals are brought from the Tropics to 
higher latitudes, where there are lower temperatures and greater 
variability of weather, the troubles which they experience are mostly 
pulmonary. It appears that, on the whole, the measurable physio- 
logical disturbances are not very significant, in so far, at lea.st, as 
our pre.sent data go. There are, however, nonmeasurable nervous 
effects which may be much more critical and fundamental in the 
problem of acclimatization. Dr. B. C. Crowell, in an address before 
the American Philosophical Society, five years ago (1925), said, 
in speaking of the effects of tropical climates upon white men, 
"Science has not been able to measure the unque.sti(mably harmful 
influence on the nervous .system of a constant temperature, bright 
sunshine, bnlliant colors, and the absence of seasonal variations." 
28095—31 37 



566 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 

The strain of residence in tropical climates seems to react distinctly 
unfavorably upon the nervous system of the majority of persons 
from colder climates, and, in the opinion of many medical authori- 
ties, it is just here that the greatest obstacle in the way of white 
colonization may be found. The muggy, oppressive " hothouse"" air 
is not only uncomfortable and difficult to endure, but it has a dis- 
tinctly enervating effect, which is more or less widespread among all 
white residents in the Tropics, and especially among women and chil- 
dren. Energetic physical and mental action are difficult, even 
impossible. " A depression of bodily and mental activity follows — 
enervation, indifference, disinclination to exertion, a general, ill- 
defined condition of debility." There is lessened power to do work, 
greater fatigue from work, lowered vitality. Dr. James Horton, an 
English physician, who was for some time stationed on the west 
coast of tropical Africa, reported that every continued mental effort 
in that climate was almost immediately accompanied by extreme 
fatigue and headache. While in England he could be actively at 
work 15 hours a day, he found that immediately on his return to the 
Tropics six hours was his extreme limit of continued activity and 
intellectual effort if he wished to avoid serious mental fatigue. An 
anemic condition is widespread in the moist Tropics. All this 
renders the body less able to resist disease. It is already weakened, 
and then the microorganism of some specific disease finds a fertile 
field for its ravages. The individual has largely lost his powers of 
resistance. 

The monotony of tropical heat, together with a high degree of 
humidity, may produce the condition of neurasthenia so widespread 
among the white population of the Tropics, " a complex of symptoms 
produced by nerve exhaustion and often associated with, if not caus- 
ing, an alteration in bodily nutrition." " It is this terrible nerve 
exhaustion," writes Dr. Havelock Charles, president of the Medical 
Board of India, " which has, in the past, been the most important 
factor in preventing the northern races from settling and procreating 
their line with a full share of the nerve vigor which the parental 
stock possessed." Tropical neurasthenia is not directly fatal, but 
it tends to create an emotional state of depression and to undermine 
a vigorous and healthy constitution. It prevents the development 
and maintenance of the viens sana in corpore sano. 

The problem of acclimatization is not a question of climate alone. 
It is tremendously complicated by the controls exercised by race, diet, 
occupations, habits of life, and the like. The Chinese, for example, 
succeed where other people have failed. Indeed, so well do they 
thrive that there may, in the distant future, be more in " the Yellow 
Peril " than most people are willing to believe. The southern Eu- 
ropean is more successful than the northern European; the Latin 



WHITE RACE IN THE TROPICS — WARD 567 

than the Ang:lo-Saxon. Those whose diet is light and simple fare 
better than tliose who are hearty eaters and much of whose food is 
meat. Excessive indul»;ence in stronfj alcoholic bevera<;es is always 
injurious and danj^orous. The En«;lishman who indulfjjes freely in 
his brandy and soda in the hot Tropics is likely sooner to fall a victim 
to disease than is the Italian who drinks only lij^ht wines. Indoor 
occupations which keep people out of the sun are far more favorable 
than labor outdoors. ShopktH?pers and clerks have, other thinfjs be- 
ing equal, a better chaiice of keeping fit and well than do white 
policemen, or soldiers, or railway employees. Life in the Tropics, 
away from home associations and traditions and standards, is ex- 
tremely likely to lead to the excessive use of intoxicating liquor, to 
lowered moral tone, to sexual indulgence, to a distaste for ajid avoid- 
ance of reasonable physical exercise; to an incorrect and poorly 
balanced diet. These, and other conditions, combine to make a 
normal, healthy life very difficult for most men from northern lati- 
tudes whose business takes them to the Tropics, and keeps them there 
for any considerable length ol" time. It is, of course, true that most of 
these handicaps to sane and healthy living can be overcome, but to 
overcome them takes more strength of will and moral backbone than 
many persons possess, and they remain as contributory controls in 
the general question of acclimatization. Dr. B. C. Crowell has 
pointed out that " the e(|uilibrium of the white man's nervous system 
and his energy and initiative are disturbed by contact with impassive 
and at times stupid colored natives, by the tendency to the abuse of 
stimulants, and by the general lowering of the moral tone." 

There is another factor in this great complex which one of my 
European colleagues has aptly termed " the climate of loneliness." 
It is psychological in its nature. It is found in every part of the 
world. The more socially inclined any individual is, the more signif- 
icant is the role of " the climate of loneliness " in his case. It must 
not be lost sight of. It must not be confused with the ordinary 
climatic factors. It should be given weight — and sometimes tragically 
significant weight — as a contributing element in any discussion of the 
problem of acclimatization. How often has " the climate of loneli- 
ness " been the fundamental cause of the wreck — physical, mental, and 
moral — of the lives of young men and young women, whose breaking 
down, whose ill-health, and even whose deaths, were attributed to the 
tropical climate alone I " The climate of loneliness " is hard enough 
to bear at its best, in the climates to which one is accustomed at home. 
But it is in the deadening monotony of the steaming Tropics, far 
from home, that the real suffering which is caused by " the climate of 
loneliness " is experienced. 

As compared with the death rates in colder latitudes, tropical statis- 
tics of mortality average high. These death rates, however, represent 



568 ANNUAL. REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

such very diverse conditions of season, climate, race, occupation, soil, 
mode of life, food, dwelling, etc., that they can not properly be com- 
pared with one another. The prevalence of some special disease in 
exceptionally virulent or widespread development will raise the death 
rate of any one year far beyond its normal figure. Again, the 
presence of some plant disease or pest which causes loss of crops, and 
the resulting lowered vitality of the people in consequence of insuffi- 
cient food, may easily swell the death rate. Nowhere can these 
tropical death rates properly be compared with those noted under 
different conditions in other latitudes. Most of the reliable statistics 
of mortality relating to white men in the Tropics are for soldiers, that 
is, men, in the prime of life, subjected to rigid discipline; provided, 
when possible, with carefully selected food, proper living quarters, 
and adequate medical and sanitary supervision. Obviously, death 
rates for white soldiers in the Tropics are not directly comi^arable 
with the death rates in our own country, which include all ages, both 
sexes, and very diverse living conditions, as well as deaths by accident 
and old age. So various and so complex are the controlling factors 
that critical comparative study is not worth while. Some years ago 
I was asked to present a paper on tropical death rates before a scien- 
tific body, but I declined the invitation on the ground that such a 
discussion was really not a profitable one. 

Tropical death rates are certainly high, but this fact should not be 
attributed solely to the dangers of the climate. Bad sanitary con- 
ditions and lack of medical attendance account for many, if not 
most, of the high mortality rates among the natives; and an irra- 
tional mode of life explains many deaths among persons coming from 
cooler climates. Tropical death rates have been, and are being, re- 
duced with remarkable rapidity in all countries which are wholly 
or partly under white control, and especially among white troops in 
the Tropics. This is the result of experience with tropical condi- 
tions, and of the increased precautions that are now taken in select- 
ing and caring for the men. 

The death rates among white people in the Tropics range from 
the appalling figure of 483 per thousand among European troops on 
the Gold Coast of Africa in 1829-1836 — almost every other man 
died — down through steadily lower figures until we come to a 
rate as low as 5 per thousand for the British troops in India in recent 
years. A few illustrations of the change may be given. A death 
rate of 115 in French Cochin China in the 1860's had been reduced 
to about 20 per thousand in the later 1870's and early 1880's. Among 
Dutch white soldiers in Java the rate of 170 in the second and third 
decades of the nineteenth century had been lowered to less than 20 
in the last decade. Very striking, also, has been a phenomenal re- 
duction in the death rate from dysentery among the Dutch troops 



WHITE RACE IN THE TROPICS — WARD 569 

in Java, from 13 per thousand in the 1870's to less than 1 per thou- 
sand in the 1880's, a decrease attributed to the avoidance of con- 
taminated water as the result of the use of artesian wells. 

The mortality rate of tlie British Army in India has fallen from 
over 80 per thousand in the early decades of the nineteenth century, 
successively, in later periods, to under GO, under 20, under 10, and even 
to 5 in the most recent years. In Ceylon, reckoned as one of the most 
unhealthy stations, the rate was over 110 and is now about 7. In 
western equatorial Africa, formerly known as " the white man's 
grave," the terrible fi«i;ure of earlier years lias fallen to a fraction of 
the former rate. Such statistics are clear proofs of the notable 
triumphs of medical science and of military orjranization. In many 
former wars, for one victim claimed by a bullet, an arrow, or a spear, 
four or five victims, even perhaps nine or ten, were claimed by disease. 
The records of the Crimean War and of the Boer War furnished 
striking evidence of this fact. Our own record in the war with Spain 
was not one to be proud of. Encouraging as is this remarkable re- 
duction in tropical death rates, it should be observed that, as the 
Indian Medical Record pointed out some years ago, " The lowered 
death rate in hot countries is not evidence in favor of acclimatization, 
but, on the contrary, it shows that this low rate is only reached after 
the taking of most elaborate precautions. It is rather a proof of the 
inability of the white race to colonize in the Tropics, i. e., to labor and 
undergo exposure there. It is absurd to say that a reduced death 
rate, directly due to the careful avoidance of every possilile exposure, 
is an evidence that such exposure can be endured." Furthermore, it 
is but natural that large numbers of white soldiers, and of civilians 
also, are if possible invalided home to cooler climates as soon as it is 
discovered that recovery will be slow, or difficult, in the Tropics. It 
thus results that many invalids, in cases where they do not recover, 
have died on the voyage back, or at home, and their deaths do not 
figure in the tropical death rates. I have seen statistics, authority 
for which I am unable to give, that in a fairly recent year the death 
rate among a certain group of European troops invalided home, or 
discharged, was over 50 per thousand. 

In general, as I see it, no statistics of tropical mortality can be a 
true index of health conditions there for the reason that many tropical 
diseases, not necessarily or highly fatal, leave their victims in a 
weakened and debilitated condition. In addition to those who die of 
disease, there are many who become wrecks of their former selves and 
are unable to carry on. The economic loss resulting from this condi- 
tion is necessarily a very great handicap. 

In considering tropical diseases in relation to acclimatization, the 
thought inevitably ari.ses in one's mind whether, with the eventual 
elimination and eradication of the major tropical diseases, the prob- 



570 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

lem of acclimatization will not be solved. No one can read of the 
wonderful progress that has been made in the fight against yellow 
fever, malaria, hookworm, and dysentery, without looking to the 
future with high hope of a continuing and eventually a complete 
conquest. The work of General Gorgas at Panama, in reducing 
the death rates from 40 per thousand to 7.5, a year or so later, is 
certainly an object lesson in successful prophylaxis. It is one of 
many " monuments of victory," as these splendid achievements in the 
war on tropical disease, in Panama, in Cuba, in the Philippines, and 
elsewhere, have well been called. It has been estim.ated that in the 
Malay States, over 30,000 lives were saved by the introduction of 
an adequate drainage system. Fifty years ago the death rate in 
Jamaica averaged over 50 per thousand. It has now been reduced 
to nearly that in our own cities. A brilliant group of medical men — 
heroes, all of them, and several of them martyrs to medical science — 
has accomplished almost incredible results. The areas ravaged by 
some diseases have been limited. " Quinine, kerosene and mosquito 
netting" have accomplished wonders. The future certainly looks 
bright. Many diseases associated, directly or indirectly, with trop- 
ical heat and moisture can now be effectively guarded against by 
the intelligent and persistent observance of simple rules of living. 
Medical science already knows, fully or partially, the best methods 
of controlling and preventing such diseases as plague, cholera, yellow 
fever, typhus, malaria, sleeping sickness. As a recent medical writer 
has put it, the question of how far to apply this knowledge in a 
practical way is now very largely one of expense and of incentive. 
In this discussion certain facts seem to stand out in the mind of a 
layman. Tropical diseases are still, and will for generations remain, 
a very serious handicap to white settlement of the Tropics. Medical 
men will doubtless be the first to agree that a great deal of slow, 
patient scientific research must still be accomplished before the fight 
against the widely extended strongholds of many tropical diseases 
can be successfully carried through. Sanitary campaigns, on a vast 
scale, must be undertaken. These are immensely expensive, perhaps 
for generations to come prohibitively expensive. And they may also 
be very difficult because of the ignorance and opposition of the 
natives. To quote, " Those who are not actively engaged in the war 
against tropical disease are not given to exuberant optimism con- 
cerning the outlook, but are preparing for a conquest ' which must 
be sustained with method and tenacity ' for years to come." The 
brilliant work accomplished in Cuba, in Panama and elsewhere, in 
the fight against yellow fever, involved a very large expenditure of 
money. The area was limited. There was strong military or 
civilian compulsory authority behind it. If one looks at the extent 
of the wet Tropics on any map of the world's climates, the impos- 



WHITE RACE IN THE TROPICS WARD 571 

sibility of carrying through any such campaign over the whole of 
that vast area will be obvious at one glance. Yet, in spite of all 
these difllculties, the advance that has been made within the last few 
decades inevitably leads us to hope that eventually life may be as 
safe from disease in the inner Tropics as it is in our own home 
climates. 

In view of the large number of factors involved in the problem 
of acclimatization, and of the very incomplete state of our Icnowledge 
on the subject, it is not surprising that the opinions of writers 
differ very markedly from one another. There is, on the one hand, 
the group which takes a distinctly pessimistic view, and sees prac- 
tically no hope whatever. Those who belong in this group are mostly 
men who expressed their opinions many years ago, before the days 
of the modern study of tropical medicine and of tropical sanitation. 
In the second category we find those who believe that acclimatization 
is merely a question of overcoming disease; who look forward to a 
rapid elimination of all tropical diseases, and who do not regard the 
effects of the physiological disturbances of any special significance. 
Writers of a third group fully recognize the progress made in the 
warfare on tropical disease but do not, even in their most optimistic 
moments, see the disappearance of tropical diseases which are such a 
tremendous handicap to white settlement in the Tropics. They be- 
lieve th'&t, entirely apart from the presence or absence of disease, hot, 
damp tropical climates liave a deleterious influence upon white men, 
especially upon white women and children, which operates and will 
operate as an apparently insuperable obstacle to the complete 
acclimatization of our race in the Tropics. 

It will help to understand the views of these three groups of writers 
if we quote briefly. Alfred Russell Wallace held the view that true 
acclimatization is impossible. "An Englishman," he said, " who 
can only live in Rome by sleeping in a tower and never venturing 
forth at night can not be said to be truly acclimated." The older 
generation will easily remember the days when cautious travelers 
in Italy never accepted a room on the ground floor of a hotel, and 
always came in before sunset. Those were, of course, the days when 
malaria was rampant on the Roman campagna, and experience had 
shown that what was called " Roman fever " was " caught " oftenest 
by those who were out in the evening, and who had rooms near the 
ground. The correct explanation is, of course, to be found in the 
fact that the malaria-bearing mosquito is nocturnal in its habits, 
and usually does not fly far above the ground. Those were the days 
when life on the equatorial west coast of Africa was a very dangerous 
and uncertain business. The doggerel, " the Bight of Benin, and few 
come out that ever go in," was a common way of expressing the 
serious risk of landing in the Bight of Benin, the body of water 



572 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

off the Slave Coast of Africa. It was a popular saying at that time 
that every British colony on the vilest coast of Africa had three 
governors, one on his way out on a steamer to assume his post of 
duty, one still carrying on the government of the colony, and the 
third on his way home in the handsomely appointed coffin which 
the government had provided for him. In The Control of the 
Tropics published in 1898, Benjamin Kidd wrote: "The Tropics 
* * * can only be governed as a trust for civilization, and with 
a full sense of the responsibility which such a trust involves. The 
first principle of success in undertaking such a duty seems to the 
writer to be a clear recognition of the cardinal fact that in the 
Tropics the white man lives and works only as a diver lives and works 
under water. Alike in a moral, in an ethical, and in a political 
sense, the atmosphere he breathes must be that of another region; 
that which produced him and to which he belongs. Neither physi- 
cally, morally, nor politically, can he be acclimatized in the Tropics." 
Kipling put much the same idea into verse : 

"And the eud of the fight is a tombstone white 

With the name of the late deceased, 
And the epitaph clear, 'A fool lieth here 

Who tried to hustle the East,' " 

Of India, Meredith Townsend in his book, "Asia and Europe," 
made the following significant statement : " Not only is there no 
white race in India ; not only is there no white colony, but there is 
no white man who proposes to remain. No ruler stays there to help, 
or criticize, or moderate his successor. No successful white soldier 
founds a family. No white man who makes a fortune builds a house 
or buys an estate for his descendants. The very planter, the very 
engine driver, the very foreman of works departs before he is 60, 
leaving no child, or house, or trace of himself. No white man takes 
root in India." 

There is a practically universal conviction on the part of white 
residents in the Tropics that they need to renew their strength and 
vigor by going back to their home climates at frequent intervals, 
unless they wish to wear themselves out, and some day succumb as 
hopeless wrecks. For white children, especially, a long residence 
in the Tropics is highly undesirable. One competent authority says : 
"As a matter of fact there is a constant stream of invalids sent 
home from all tropical climates, and omitting a few dissenters, 
there is a generally accepted opinion that two years is the longest 
period it is safe to remain in hot places without a more or less 
prolonged vacation in a cold country." A surgeon who had long 
experience in the Tropics says that the limit of endurance of an 
equatorial climate, even on an island, and for a stroilg man, is 



WHITE RACE IN THE TROPICS — WARD 573 

seven years. An American Army medical oflicer has stated that 
the most energetic and stalwart Americans after a year of service 
in the Philippines lose energy, strength, and amhition. I have 
a copy of a letter written by an Knglish judge v.lio h:ui long L»een 
a resident of Ceylon, in which he emphasizes the tragedy of send- 
ing the children back to England, lie writes. " Surely for us 
there is no climate like our own. And when all is said, in a tropical 
climate, even of the best, we live as it were on suti'erance, and the 
climate tells on the next generation. For every one of us who has 
his livelihood in Ceylon, there comes the inevitable day when he 
must part from his children and send them home. This stern neces- 
sity has been styled a ])rice which we pay for our Eastern posses- 
sions — and a heavy price it is." 

The second group of writers says, in brief, " The conquest of the 
Tropics is not yet an accomplished fact, but enough has been done 
to show that most or all of the disabilities of the climate can be 
overcome. The Tropics are not unhealthy because of any effects 
of the climate, but because of the diseases peculiar to the Tropics. 
Many of these are now preventable; the others will soon be so. 
With their disappearance, the countries formerly thought deadly 
for white men and women have actually come to be almost salubrious. 
Most, if not all. of tlie difficulties are due to such factors as intemper- 
ance, improper food, sexual indulgence, the proximity of inferior 
races, and the like. These are handicaps, but they can be overcome. 
They are secondary and indirect climatic effects, and will disappear. 
The acclimatization problem is rapidly nearing its natural solution." 

Such optimism seems, to me at least, beyond the bounds of rea- 
son. That the elimination of some tropical diseases has made a 
tremendous change for the better in certain parts of the Tropics 
no one will deny, but that effects of tlie physiological disturbances 
remain, and the happy future forseen by these enthusiasts is not 
yet in sight, is equally true. 

The views of the third group are intermediate between those of 
the first two categories. There is, in the minds of most writers on 
acclimatization, the conviction that even if all tropical diseases could 
conceivably be eliminated from the picture, there would still remain 
those insidious physiological effects of the tropical sun, the heat ami 
the humidity already referred to; the general physical, mental, and 
moral deterioration; the neurasthenia; the inability to maintain full 
bodily and mental vigor. In the present stage of our knowledge, 
true acclimatization is considered impossible, and while, with proper 
precautions, individual white men can live in the Tropics, the race 
can not persist. This thought, Dr. Andrew Balfour, director of the 
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, has recently 



574 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 

stated as follows : " So far as the race is concerned, I am persuaded 
that the hot and humid Tropics are not suited to white colonization 
and never will be with our present knoweldge, even if they were 
rendered as free from disease as England." The same idea was 
expressed by Dr. John C. Phillips, in an article in the Harvard 
Alumni Bulletin, four years ago : " I doubt whether the white man 
can ever escape the ultimate effect of the Tropics (particularly the 
mental effect) merely by living at high altitudes. He may well 
escape all tropical diseases, but there are subtle deteriorating influ- 
ences that will finally come upon him unless there are regular and 
extended visits to the homeland." Some few years ago I wrote to 
the editor of one of the leading English medical journals, the Lancet, 
asking him to state briefly what he believed to be the views of the 
medical profession in his country on the question of acclimatization 
in view of the long experience of British soldiers and civilians in 
tropical countries, especially in India. It should be remembered 
that much of India and of other monsoon areas, especially during 
the rains, have conditions of heat, moisture, and rainfall very similar 
to those of the low altitudes near the equator. The answer to my 
request was an excellent editorial in two successive issues of the 
Lancet, giving considerable detail, and summarizing the conclusions 
briefly in the following statement : " That residence in hot climates 
under the circumstances of ordinary life has an adverse effect upon 
Europeans can not, we think, be doubted. Some constitutions seem 
to be altogether unfitted for these climates, and such individuals lose 
their health and physical energy from the moment of their arrival. 
A still larger number do so sooner or later under a more protracted 
residence, even if they escape being attacked by one or the other of 
the endemic or epidemic diseases incidental to such climates. Resi- 
dence in tropical and subtropical countries usually produces a very 
appreciable effect, not only on the complexion but on the constitution, 
and notably so during childhood and youth." 

Such quotations might be extended almost indefinitely, but those 
that I have given are representative. It is obvious that there are 
real differences of opinion as to the effects of tropical climates. The 
truth lies somewhere between the extremes; between the older pessi- 
mistic and newer optimistic views. The Tropics are not as hope- 
lessly unhealthy as they have been painted. On the other hand, they 
are not, for the large majority of nonnatives, a desirable place of 
residence. To sum up this highly complex matter : White residents 
from cooler latitudes on coming into the Tropics must adjust them- 
selves physiologically to the new climates. During this adjustment 
there is more or less strain on various organs and functions of the 
body. The strain may be too severe ; then the individual suffers. The 



WHITE RACE IN THE TROPICS — WARD 575 

adjustment is usually fj^rcatly retarded and hindered by a persistence 
in habits of food, drink and general mode of life which, however 
well suited to the home climat<^, do not lit troj)ical conditions. Dur- 
ing the adjustment, especially if complicated by irrational habits, 
the body is naturally abnormally sensitive to the new diseases to 
which it is exposed. Even should no specific diseases be contracted, 
there are anemic and neurasthenic tendencies and other degenera- 
tive changes. Experience teaches that white men can not with im- 
punity do hard manual labor under a tropical sun, but that they 
may enjoy fairly good health as overseers, or at indoor work, if they 
take reasonable precaution. Acclimatization in the full sense of 
having white men and women living for successive generations in 
the Tropics, and reproducing their kind without physical, mental, and 
moral degeneration — i. e., colonization in the true sense — is impos- 
sible. Tropical disease and death rates, as has been abundantly 
shown, can be much reduced by proper attention to sanitary laws, so 
that these rates may become not much, if any, higher than those in 
the extra-Tropics. And with increasing medical knowledge of the 
nature and prevention of tropical diseases, as well as by means of 
modern sanitary methods, a white resident in the Tropics will con- 
stantly become better able to withstand disease. It can not truthfully 
be said that scientific investigation has shown that climate is an 
insuperable obstacle to the white man's residence in the Tropics. 
Further investigation is, however, very greatly needed. As Sir Pat- 
rick Manson expressed it, acclimatization is less " an unconscious 
adaptation of the physiology of the individual " than " an intelligent 
adaptation of his habits." For greater comfort, for better health, 
and for greater success, properly selected hill stations will, however, 
always be essential to northerners who have to live in the Tropics, 
especially to white women and children. 

It has been said, I believe by General Wolseley, that the white 
soldier in the Tropics is " always in campaign, if not against the 
enemy, at least against the climate." This sentence may be made 
to fit the case of the white civilian by changing it to read : The 
white race in the Tropics is always in campaign against its enemy, 
the climate. 

What of the future? Tliere will be a slow and limited settlement 
of the most favorable portions of the Tropics by nonnatives, who 
will construct houses suited to the conditions: Large, well-ventilated 
and artificially cooled, and well exposed to free-moving air. Elec- 
trical appliances of all sorts, for cooking, for refrigeration, for 
ventilation, will prove a tremendous boon to those whose lot is, in 
the future, cast in hot tropical climates. Proper clothing, modern 
sanitary measures, good hygiene — all will prove increasingly im- 



576 ANNUAX, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

portant. There is no doubt that civilized man can cope with tropical 
conditions and problems far more successfully thaa can the native. 
The white man can live there, but he needs intelligence and a rigid 
discipline in order to do so successfully. His mode of life must 
conform to the climate. He should not expect that his internal 
physiological adjustments will make him independent of his environ- 
ment. "Toleration of climate is one thing; independence of it is 
quite another." Life in the Tropics will, in the future, certainly be- 
come more comfortable as well as safer for the white race, but in the 
light of our present knowledge, acclimatization, in its full and literal 
sense, is and will remain impossible. 



THE EIGHTH WONDER: THE HOLLAND VEHICULAR 

TUNNEL ' 



By Cabl C. GaAT and H. F. Haqen * 



:\Vltli 30 plates] 



Back in tho second century B. C, a certain Antipater of Sidon 
composed an epigram in which he enumerated whiit he termed the 
" Seven Wonders of the World." They were the walls of Babylon, 
the statute at Olympia by Phidias, tlie hanfTJnf; gardens at Babylon, 
the Colossus of Rhodes, the pyramids of Egypt, the mausoleum at 
Haliearnassus, and the temple of Artemis at Ephesus. 

To-day any similar list of wonders, no matter by whom compiled, 
would doubtless include the pyramids, not merely because they alone 
have survived the ravages of time, but because they still represent a 
marvelous achievement of man's handiwork. What the other won- 
ders would be might afford material for a contest sponsored by some 
newspaper columnist. But surely there would be a place in such a 
list for the Holland Tunnel, as the longest subaqueous tunnel in the 
world, a stupendous project, magnificently conceived and executed. 
And surely old Antipater himself, however wedded he might be to 
his own wonders, would to-day be glad to add the Holland Tunnel 
to his list, as an eighth wonder of the world. 

It is with this belief that the following record of its history has 
been written, in recognition of the magnitude of the task, of the 
heroism of its first chief engineer, Clifford M. Holland, and his suc- 
cessor, Milton H. Freeman, both of whom gave their lives to the 
undertaking, and of the great advance in the science of ventilation 
which its construction made possible. 

Of course, a tunnel is no new thing. Primitive man, living close 
to nature, could hardly have failed to observe evidences of tunneling 
by animal life about him, and soon made tunnels for his own pur- 
poses. We know that in ancient Egypt a king, upon ascending the 
throne, began at once to excavate the long narrow passage leading

porarily diverted from its channel. It was 12 feet wide, 15 feet high, 
and was lined with brick masonry. 



THE HOLLAND TUNNEL — GRAY AND HAGEN 579 

In the time of Caesar Augustus, or perhaps even earlier, the lio- 
mans built a notable tunnel through the Tosilipo hills, between 
Naples and Pozzuoli, about 3,000 feet long and 25 feet wide. In 
order to light this tunnel, its lioor and roof were made to converge 
gradually from the ends to the middle : at the entrances it was 75 
feet high. The Komans were the greatest tunnel builders of an- 
tiquity. During the Middle Ages tunnel building was chiefly for 
military purposes. Every great castle had its private underground 
passage from the central tower or keep to some distant concealed 
place, through which to make sorties, receive supplies, or escape in 
time of need. 

With the advent of gunpowder and of canal construction, a strong 
impetus was given to tunnel building in its more modern aspect of 
commercial or public utility. Previous to 1800, canal tunnels were all 
through rock or hard ground. Then, in 1803, a soft-ground tunnel 24 
feet wide was excavated for the Saint Augustine Canal in France. 
Timbers were laid to support the roof and walls as fast as the earth 
was removed, and the masonry lining built closely following. From 
this experience the various systems of soft-ground tunneling since 
employed have developed. 

The use of shield and metal lining marks the greatest develojjment 
in the art of soft-ground submarine tunneling. The shield was in- 
vented and first used by Sir Marc Isambard Brunei in excavating the 
first tunnel under the river Thames at London, begun in 1825 and 
opened in 1843. In 1860 Peter William Barlow used an iron lining 
in connection with a shield in driving the second tuimel under the 
Thames at London. 

The modern tunnel shield is a steel-plate cylinder whose forward 
edge acts as a cutting edge. Its rear end, extending backward, over- 
laps the tunnel lining of cast-iron rings. Inside the shield, hydraulic 
jacks act against the tunnel lining as a thrust block so as to push the 
shield ahead when pressure is applied. A partition prevents earth 
from entering the shield except as permitted through suitable open- 
ings. As the shield moves forward, the lining is erected under the 
protection of its rear. In submarine tunneling compressed air 
pumped into the forward end of the tunnel counterbalances the pres- 
sure of the water which tries to enter. 

In 1906 the Legislatures of the States of New York and New Jersey 
ci-eated for each State a bridge commission to investigate the feasi- 
bility of constructing a bridge over the Hudson River, uniting New 
York City with Jersey City. Legislative recognition was thus given 
to an increasingly vital problem — some means to supplement the 
ferries plying between these two ports. 

Further legislation, enacted from time to time, continued the life 
of these commissions. In 1913 they were authorized to consider the 
possibility of a vehicular tunnel. Finally, on April 10, 1919, author- 



580 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 

ity was granted them to proceed with the construction of a tunnel, 
or tunnels, between a point in the vicinity of Canal Street on the 
island of Manhattan and a point in Jersey City. 

Those who had the j)roject closest at heart felt that the tunnel 
would 

1. Shorten the time of transit across the Hudson River and afford a con- 
tinuous means of communication between New York and New Jersey, unaffected 
by climatic or otlier interference. 

2. Relieve traffic congestion, already serious. 

3. Accelerate the movement of necessarj' supplies into the city of New York, 
and thereby i-elieve conditions of distress. 

4. Increase the tax value of real property within a considerable radius of 
the tunnel terminals. 

5. Pay its cost three times over within 20 years. 

6. Reduce the high cost of living by reducing the cost of trucking. 

7. Increase the facilities for commerce in the port of New York by removing 
from the surface of the harbor many lighters and other floating equipment. 

8. Furnish means for the uninterrupted movements of troops and supplies 
to and from the city of New York in case of need. 

The commission selected as chief engineer, Mr. Clifford M. Hol- 
land, tunnel engineer of the Public Service Commission, First Dis- 
trict, State of New York, in immediate charge of the construction of 
all subway tunnels under the East River. He was regarded as hav- 
ing had a greater and more successful experience in the work of 
subaqueous tunnel construction than any other member of his pro- 
fession. A board of consulting engineers was appointed, and a 
contract or treaty between the two States was drawn up and ap- 
proved by the commissions and given the consent of Congress. 

Chief Engineer Holland took office on July 1, 1919, and at once 
began the organization of an engineering staff. His chief assistants 
were selected from those who had been associated with him in the 
construction of the East River subway tunnels. Having had not 
less than 10 years' experience in subaqueous tunneling, they were 
well qualified both by technical training and by practical experience 
to meet the requirements of the work. Actual construction began 
October 12, 1920. 

Upon the death of Mr. Holland on October 27, 1924, at Battle 
Creek Sanitarium, where he had gone in search of health after de- 
voting all his strength and energy to the construction of the tunnel, 
the commissions gave it his name. Under his direction all the more 
difficult portions had been completed and the remaining details 
planned, and on the very day his body was borne to his home there 
came a demonstration of his engineering skill and accuracy in the 
successful junction of the under-river headings of the north turmel. 

His successor, Mr. Milton H. Freeman, had been his division en- 
gineer. He, too, gave himself unsparingly to the work, and died on 
March 24, 1925. He was succeeded by Mr. Ole Singstad, who had 



THE HOLLAND TUNNEL GRAY AND HAGEN 581 

been engineer of desitrus under both Mr. Holland and Iklr. Freeman. 
Under his direction the Ilolhiml Tuunel hus been completed. 

The Holland Tunnel is located in the vicinity of Canal Street, 
New York City, because that street is a wide east and west thorough- 
fare giving direct communication across tiie island of Manhattan. 
On the east, Canal Street connects with the East liiver bridges and 
Brooklyn; on the west, with the Hudson River water front, at ap- 
proximately the center of down-town trailic over the Hudson ferries. 

Its location in Jersey City is at the logical point as nearly opposite 
Canal Street as is practicable, in order to obtain the shortest tunnel. 
This point is very near the center of traffic and is advantageously 
located. It gives direct communication to Jersey City Heights and 
points beyond by means of the Thirteenth Street viaduct. The water 
front, with imjx>riant railroad yards, is easily accessible and ade- 
quate communication is afforded with the low-lying parts of Jersey 
City and Hoboken through streets which parallel the river. 

The southerly tube for eastbound traffic extends from Provost and 
Twelfth Streets, Jersey City, under the Erie Railroad yards, the 
Hudson River, and Canal Street to Varick Street, New York City. 
The northerly tube for westbound traffic extends from Broome Street 
midway between Varick and Hudson Streets in New York City, 
curving to the west to Spring and Hudson Streets and under Hud- 
son Street and the Hudson River, the Erie, and the Delaware, Lack- 
awanna and Western Railroad yards to Fourteenth Street at Prevost 
Street. Jersey City. 

In planning a public undertaking of the magnitude of the Holland 
Tunnel, consideration had to be given to many features besides those 
of actual tunneling. The building of the structure itself was a 
great engineering problem, but many investigations beyond mere 
technical dasign were required. 

To secure the best location and arrangement of tunnel roadways, 
a survey of present and future traffic and the influence of the tunnel 
on the development of adjacent territory was called for, first of all. 
Traffic conditions had to be considered from many angles, such as 
capacity, congestion of the tunnel roadway, adequate approaches, 
congestion in adjoining streets, width of roadway, and the growth 
and development of vehicular traffic. 

A preliminary forecast of tunnel traffic, based chiefly on the yearly 
increase in traffic over the Hudson ferries, resulted in an estimate of 
the number of vehicles that would use the tunnel as follows : 

Number 

1924 (when tunnel was expected to be opened) 5,610,000 

1935 13. 800, 000 

1937 15, 700, 000 

1943 2li, 300, 000 

28095—31 38 



582 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

Further estimates indicated that a 1-line tunnel would have a 
capacity about equal to the traffic demand at the opening of the 
tunnel. A 2-line tunnel would have sufficient capacity to accommo- 
date all traffic up to 1937, while a 3-line tunnel would reach its capac- 
ity in 1943. 

Obviously it would be unwise to construct a 1-line tunnel whose 
capacity would be reached as soon as put in operation. As between 
a 2-line and a 3-line tunnel, it was found that the difference in cost, 
with interest, would be sufficient to pay for another 2-line tunnel 
after the first 2-line tunnel had outgrown its capacity. Of greater 
importance was the consideration that no street or section could 
accommodate the volume of traffic represented by a 3-line tunnel. 

If a 3-line tunnel were built, it could be operated at only 2-line 
capacity. This would violate two of the main principles governing 
proper tunnel planning — the distribution of traffic so as to avoid 
undue congestion, and the investment of capital for construction only 
as facilities are needed, without the necessity of providing for the 
distant future. These are two of the most important features in 
which tunnel construction is held to be superior to bridge construc- 
tion in crossing wide, navigable rivers. 

The cost of a long-span bridge does not vary directly with the 
span but increases about as the square of the span. On such a bridge 
no conmiensurate saving in the cost of construction is obtained by 
omitting some of its facilities. The tendency in bridge construction, 
therefore, is to provide facilities greatly in excess of immediate 
requirements, with a consequent expenditure of capital long before 
those facilities are needed. Then when there is sufficient traffic to 
utilize the bridge to full capacity, the resulting congestion in the 
vicinity of the bridge entrances becomes a serious matter. This is 
seen in the case of the East River bridges in New York City to-day. 

Tunnel construction, on the other hand, is more flexible than 
bridge construction, because the cost is a direct function of its length, 
with the volume of excavation increasing as the square of the 
diameter. Since the cost of excavation represents a large part of 
the total cost of a tunnel, any increase in the width of roadway can 
be made only at considerable expense. The proper way to plan a 
tunnel is to avoid the disadvantages inherent in bridge construction, 
build only for the present and near future, and construct other 
tunnels at other locations when the facilities of the first tunnel are 
outgrown. 

Since a 2-line tunnel would have sufficient capacity to accommo- 
date traffic up to 1937, and a 3-line tunnel would create such traffic 
congestion in the vicinity of its entrances and exits as to preclude its 
use to capacity ; also since the difference in cost between a 2-line and 
a 3-line tunnel, with interest, would pay for a new 2-line tunnel 



THE HOLLAND TUNNEL GRAY AND HAGEN 583 

when the first was outfrrown, the obvious proceeding; was to construct 
a 2-liue tunnel and when its capacity is reached, to build another 
2-line tunnel at some other location as determined by future traflio 
conditions. The Holland Tunnel is, therefore, a twin-tube tunnel, 
providing in each tube for two lines of traffic in each direction. 

In planning the entrances and exits of the tunnel, a careful study 
was made of veliicular traffic, with particular reference to its move- 
ment at street intersections ami through the tunnel. It was recog- 
nized that wherever traflic intersects, its continuity is broken. In- 
stead of moving in a steady stream, it breaks into a series of waves 
as it is held up and released at intersections. This interruption in 
the stream of traffic at street intersections so limits the capacity of a 
street that its real capacity as determined by its width is never 
reached. 

A tunnel differs from a street in that the only interruptions by 
cross traffic are at the entrances and exits. Consequently these 
points are of vital importance, affecting as they do the ultimate ca- 
pacity of the tunnel. Unless the entrances and exits insure con- 
tinuity of traffic during the period of maximum demand, the 
capacity of the tunnel roadway can never be reached. 

Accordingly, the entrances and exits of the Holland Tunnel are 
widely separated. In New York Cit}', one is to the north and the 
other to the south of the Canal Street through traffic; in addition 
they are located so as to be served by two main north and south 
avenues. Tunnel traffic is thus given the best iDossible facility for 
free movement while at the same time the greatest separation is se- 
cured at a reasonable cost. In accord with this same principle the 
entrance and exit at the Jersey City end are located in separate 
streets adjacent to the railroad yards east of the north and south 
traffic streets connecting Jersey City with Hoboken. 

This separation of the tunnel entrance and exit traffic is consid- 
ered to be a factor of the greatest importance in relieving congestion 
in the vicinity of the tunnel. This was particularly necessary in 
New York City, with its large and rapidly increasing volume of 
traffic. It was also called for in Jersey City, where there were no 
wide thoroughfares in the vicinity of the tunnel. 

In addition, property was taken to provide broad plazas at en- 
trances and exits. The entrance plazas serve to accommodate the 
waves of traffic as they approach the tunnel and converge in the 
portal roadway into continuous lines of vehicles through the tunnel. 
Similarly wide exit plazas insure the free and uninterrupted move- 
ment of traffic away from the tunnel. Through the .separation of 
entrance from exit, and the use of adequate plazas, the tunnel traffic 
can bo distributed over a large number of streets. 



584 AISTJTUAL REPOKT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

In considering the requirements for the width of the roadways 
and the clear headroom needed, measurements were taken of vehicles 
crossing the Hudson on the ferries between New York and New 
Jersey. It was found that their height varied from 6 feet 6 inches 
for passenger cars to a maximum of 13 feet for large loaded trucks, 
but that the number exceeding 12 feet in height was only 1 per cent. 
The width of motor vehicles varied from 6 feet for passenger cars 
and light trucks to a maximum of 10 feet 6 inches for army transport 
trucks. In the case of 3-horse teams, the outside dimension of the 
three horses abreast was 9 feet, but the number of vehicles exceeding 
8 feet in width was only 3i/^ per cent. 

In determining the amount of clear headroom required, it was 
necessary to consider the matter of providing sufficient area in the 
tunnel roadway. Any increase in clear headroom, without increas- 
ing the size of the tunnel, could be made only at the expense of the 
available ventilating duct area. Any reduction in this area would 
increase the power required for ventilation and add to the cost of 
operating the tunnel. 

Given a maximum height of 12 feet 2 inches and a maximum width 
of 8 feet, a clear headroom of 13 feet 6 inches seemed adequate to 
allow even for jacking up vehicles in case of breakdown, and this 
was decided upon. 

Normal operating conditions in a tunnel accommodating two 
lines of vehicles in the same direction on one roadway obtain when 
there is a slow line of heavy trucks 8 feet wide abreast of a fast line 
of light trucks and passenger cars 6 feet wide. It is, however, 
necessary to provide for such a contingency as when a vehicle of 
maximum width has to pass another of the same width that has 
stalled. The roadway has to be sufficiently wide to permit the pas- 
sage abreast of two vehicles of maximum width. 

It was believed that in the slow line, operating at a speed varying 
from 3 to 6 miles per hour, a clearance of not less than 6 inches 
between the outside of the tire and the curb should be provided. In 
the fast line, due to the greater speed, this clearance should not be 
less than 1 foot. It was also considered that for safe and convenient 
operation a clearance between moving vehicles of 2 feet 9 inches 
should be allowed. These considerations led to the adoption of a 
width of roadway of 20 feet, with, in addition, a sidewalk 2 feet 
wide in each tunnel. This sidewalk is set back from the curb line 
a distance of 6 inches and is located at an elevation of 26 inches 
above the roadway. 

This roadway is paved with granite blocks laid in the usual sand 
cement cushion layer, about 1 inch thick, with the joints filled with 
hot asphalt mixed with heated sand. By means of squeegees, a thin 
coating, sprinkled with sand, is left upoii the surface, resulting in a 



THE HOLLAND TUNNEI. GRAY AND HAGEN 585 

smooth, resilient, and lon^-wearinf; surface that will help to deaden 
the sounds due to trallic, and he more quickly repaired than concrete. 

Each side of the roadway is lined with a j^aanite curh, the roadway 
havin*; a transverse slope from one side to the other, with a de- 
pressed concrete gutter hehind the curbstone on the low side with 
side inlet openin<;:s at frequent intervals. The drain connects witli 
a sump at the low point of the tunnel, from which a dischari^e pipe 
is carried umler the roadway of each tunnel to the New York River 
shaft. Intercepting sumps with pumping equipment are provided 
in all the river and land shafts. 

The tunnel is lighted by electric lamps located in the side walls of 
the tunnel immediately below the ceiling slabs. A continuous water 
main is provided throughout the entire length of each tube, with hose 
connections for fire protection and flushing at frequent intervals. 

The walls are lined with white tile, care being taken to eliminate 
all tile containing blue, green, or red tints, upon advice of a " color 
psychologist,'' on account of its " depressing effects." The color of 
the borders is a light orange. The ceiling is painted white. 

The tunnel, with its twin tubes, 29 feet 6 inches in diameter, is the 
largest subaqueous tunnel in America, exceeding by G feet G inches the 
Pennsylvania Railroad tubes. On the New Jersey side, the diameter 
of one of the tubes is increased to 30 feet 4 inches to meet ventilation 
requirements. This exceeds by 4 inches the diameter of the Rother- 
hithe Tunnel under the river Thames, London, England, which has 
boon the largest subaqueous tunnel in the world. 

The shield method of construction was adopted for the Holland 
Tunnel after careful consideration of other schemes, notably the 
trench method. By the trench method, the work is conducted from 
a plant floating in the river, and the tunnel is constructed either 
under a protecting roof or floated into position and sunk in sections 
in a dredged trench. The longest subaqueous tunnel built by this 
method is the Detroit River tunnel of the Michigan Central Rail- 
road. 

It was recognized that in the excavation of a trench under the 
Hudson River, there would be an unavoidable interference with a 
great volume of river traffic. Fifteen hundred boats cross the line of 
the tunnel daily. Such congested river conditions would make every 
dredge or other machine working in the tunnel an obstruction to 
traffic. Collisions would be frequent, increasing the time and cost of 
the work, with danger both to shipping and to the equipment of con- 
struction. Storms, fog, and ice would cause a discontinuance of sur- 
face work for at least two months of each 3"ear. At the New York 
end, a large mass of ledge rock, involving blasting and removal at 
great depth, would be a serious obstacle to open-trench excavation 
under water. 



586 ANNUAL KEPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

Since there was a real hazard involved in carrying on operations 
from a plant anchored in midstream, the shield method was clearly 
called for. In addition, silt conditions in the Hudson River were 
regarded as extremely favorable to this method. In a trench tunnel, 
soft material greatly increases the volume of excavation, while in the 
case of a shield tunnel this material is most easily excavated. If the 
silt is not shoved aside by the shields, it is easily disposed of through 
the tunnel. The shield may be closed with the exception of certain 
openings through which the material is squeezed into the tunnel as 
the shield advances. 

The first contract provided for the sinking of two land shafts, 
one at Washington and Canal Streets and the other at Washing- 
ton and Spring Streets, New York City. They were sunk by the 
compressed-air method. 

The double steel walls of the caissons were filled with concrete as 
the caissons were sunk. This added to their weight when sinking 
weight was needed, and at the same time completed the structure of 
the walls. In addition to this concrete, weight for sinking was ob- 
tained by storing the excavated material from the working chamber 
on the roof of the chamber as the caisson went down. This necessi- 
tated handling the material a second time, but gave the desired 
weight and permitted the lowering of the caisson without greatly 
reducing the air pressure in the working chamber, thereby prevent- 
ing loss of ground. 

Upon the removal of the compressed air, the bottom seals of the 
caissons proved to be water-tight. The shafts were now ready for 
the building of the shields preparatory to the beginning of shield 
tunneling. Temporary bulkheads were provided in the west side 
walls to permit the passage of the shields, and in the east side walls 
to connect with the approach section which was to be constructed 
by excavation from the surface. 

This work was followed by placing under contract the entire un- 
der-river portion of the tunnel. Power plants had to be constructed 
to produce low-pressure air for caissons and tunnel, high-pressure 
air for the operation of grouting machines, air drills, and hoisting 
engines used below the surface, and hydraulic pressure for operat- 
ing the jacks used in driving the shield and for operating the erector 
arm for building the tunnel lining. 

Overhead gantries and dumping platforms for the receipt and 
disposal of materials and buildings for housing the workmen had 
to be provided. Pipes, through which compressed air would be 
supplied to the tunnel headings, had to be laid to the shafts. On 
the New Jersey side this involved laying low-pressure lines as large 
as 16 inches in diameter, high-pressure lines, hydraulic lines, water 



THE HOLLAND TUNNEL GRAY AND HAOEN 687 

lines, electric cables, and telephone cables. Every facility had to 
be provided, even an iiulependont telephone system connecting all 
parts of the work with the public teleplione system. 

Canal Street Park was made available as a site for the air-com- 
pressing plant and engineer's field oflice. Pier 35 and adjacent slips 
were used for the storage of materials and for the disposal of ex- 
cavated matter from the tunnel heading. Overhead gantries con- 
necting the shafts with the pier permitted traffic to the water front 
in connection with the tunnel to pass above the city streets. 

The first shield was erected in tlie Canal Street shaft. On Oc- 
tober 2G, 1922, compressed air was introduced into the shield cham- 
ber, and tunneling was begun. Each shield was 30 feet 2 inches 
in outside diameter, IG feet 4 inches long, and the upper half was 
equipped witii a hood projecting 2 feet 6 inches ahead of the shield 
proper. Five vertical and three horizontal walls divided the shield 
into 13 compartments, through which the ground in front was ex- 
cavated. It was equipped with thirty 10-inch jacks, having a 
combined thrust of 6,000 tons. A hydraulic erector was used 
to build the tunnel segments into a complete ring. The weight 
of the shield, with all equipment, was about 400 tons. 

The tunnel lining is composed of rings 2 feet 6 inches wide, 
consisting of 14 segments, each approximately 6 feet long, with 
a key 1 foot long, bolted together. Inside the lining is an inner 
lining of concrete 19 inches thick. As the shield advanced and 
the lining was erected behind it, the space due to the difference in 
tlie diameter of the shield and the rings forming the lining was 
filled by forcing a grout of cement and sand in equal parts into the 
void under high air pressure. For this purpose each segment 
was provided with a grout hole fitted with a screw plug. The lining 
was made water-tight by placing hemp grommets soaked in red 
lead around the bolts, and by caulking lead wire into grooves be- 
tween the segments. 

Shield driving requires extreme care and exactitude to keep to 
line and grade. The position of the shield fixes the location of the 
tunnel, and no correction can be made afterward. It is absolutely 
essential that the slightest deviation of the shield from its theoreti- 
cally correct j)Osition be known at once, so that measures may be 
taken to remedy the error during the next shove. The shield is 
guided by the operation of the jacks distributed around its cir- 
cumference, omitting the use of those jacks in the direction toward 
which the shield is to move. 

Every precaution was taken to provide for the safety of the work- 
men in the compressed-air chambers. A high emergency gangway in 
the upper part of the tunnel led from the shield to the locks, for 
escape In case of a blowout. Safety screens were installed to trap the 



588 ANNUAL, EEPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

inrushing water. Fire lines were installed in the compressed-air 
chambers. Fire is a real danger in compressed-air work on account 
of the increased amount of oxygen present. As an indication of the 
fire hazard, a candle, if still glowing when extinguished, will again 
burst into flame. 

The starting of the shields out of the caissons at the New York 
land shafts was difficult because of the large diameter of the shields 
and the shallow cover overhead. The material at this point was 
granular, consisting largely of fine sand, which if undisturbed, held 
air fairly well. As the shields were under the city streets, it was 
impossible to increase the cover overhead. To avoid blow-outs at the 
face with the consequent inrush of water, it was necessary to regulate 
the air pressure carefully and to protect the face during each suc- 
cessive step in excavating. 

As a preliminary step to shoving the shields out of the caissons, 
the circular steel bulkheads in the caissons were burned out in front 
of the shields. The work was done by removing the steel in hori- 
zontal layers, each layer carefully protected as the steel was removed 
to avoid exposing a great area of the face to air leakage, especially 
when the air pressure sufficient to dry out the bottom would be heavy 
enough to cause a blow-out at the top. 

Removal of the steel bulkhead was started, with the steel above 
intact and with air pressure sufficient to dry out the bottom. After 
the lower third of the steel bulkhead had been removed, a wooden 
bulkhead was built in front of the shield, and the space between this 
bulkhead and the ground ahead was packed with clay. The air 
pressure was then reduced until it balanced the water pressure at the 
top of the shield, and work was begun at the toj), removing the top 
plates and proceeding downward. 

As these plates were removed, breast boards packed front and back 
with clay were inserted to cover the exposed excavation. This work 
proceeded down to the point where the bottom plates had previously 
been removed, while at the same time the air pressure was raised step 
by step to balance the water pressure. The shield was then advanced 
against the wooden bulkhead at the bottom, compressing the clay 
which was removed as the shield advanced, with the jacks reacting 
against the cast-iron tunnel lining temporarily erected in the shaft. 

In order to prevent the leakage of air around the hood of the shield, 
an annular pocket was excavated ahead of the hood the full length 
of a shove, and this pocket was packed with clay. This served a 
double purpose : First, the hood, as the shield advanced, cut into this 
clay and made a thorough seal in front against air leakage; and 
second, by exploring the full length of the shove, assurance was had 
that the shield would not pick up and drag timbers in front of it, 
leaving open channels behind them through which air could readily 



THE HOLLAND TUNNEL GRAY AND HAGEN 589 

escape. The nccessitj' of takino: this precaution is evident when it is 
considered that at this point there were but 14 feet of cover above the 
shield to the street surface, and only 8 feet from the top of the shield 
to tlie under side of an ohl l)rick sewer, uliiih would readily allow 
the air to escape from the tunnel heading. 

As the tail of the shield loft the caisson, <]:routincj was at once 
started to fill the annular space which the shield left outside the 
tunnel lininj^. Every effort was made to keep this space fully 
grouted, even to the extent of stopping the shield in the middle of a 
shove to keep the grout up with the shield. 

The method just described was later modified so that in the bottom 
quarter of the shield, instead of pacldng ahead with clay, a fixed 
wooden bulkhead was built in the shield, and the shield was advanced 
into the fine wet sand with this bulkhead in place. This compressed 
the earth, driving out the w'ater, so that the material was firm and 
could be excavated during the shove over the top of the bulkhead, or 
through small openings cut in the bulkhead itself. This prevented a 
free run of wot material into the bottom which is the ordinary method 
of tunneling under the river. 

The grouting previously described was continued, and not only 
prevented an abnormal escape of air at the tail of the shield, but 
also prevented settlement of the streets and adjacent buildings. 
The buildings at the corner of West and Spring Streets settled 
slightly, but at no time were they in need of shoring, nor were the 
occupants disturbed at any period of the tunnel work. This was 
the situation also with the New York Central tracks under which 
the Canal Street tunnel was driven. The grouting was carried on 
so effectively that it filled some of the old sewers in the vicinity 
which later had to be cleaned out. 

The Canal Street shield passed very close to a cofferdam around 
an excavation for a sewage treatment plant, and it was evident from 
the first that great care must be exercised in driving the tunnel past 
this location. At the nearest point the .shield was within 5 feet of 
the steel sheeting of the cofferdam, with the bottom of the sheeting 
at about the springing line of tunnel. On November 30, when the 
shield was about 40 feet away, it was noticed that sand and water 
were being forced through the slieeting into (he cofferdam by the 
air |)ressure from the tunnel heading. In aijout 2 hours approxi- 
mately 150 cubic yards of earth had been blown into the excavation 
from behind the sheeting, and it was plain that not only was the 
cofferdam in rjanger, but the continuation of tunneling operations 
would be hazardous because the cavities left in the ground providi^l 
open channels for the leakage of air, which might have resulted in 
a tunnel blow-out. It was decided that tunneling operations should 
be temporarily suspended, that the steel sheeting of the cofferdam 



590 ANNUAL, EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

should be left in place permanently, and the concrete walls of the 
permanent structure placed immediately, being increased in thick- 
ness to enable them to withstand the pressure from tunneling 
operations. 

Preparatory to tunneling under the river bulkhead, clay and other 
material to prevent the escape of the compressed air from the tunnel 
were deposited in the slip between the piers and on the landward 
side of the river bulkhead to fill such voids as might remain around 
the tops of the piles supporting the timber platform of the bulkhead 
construction. Not only were the voids around the piles filled, but 
the soft mud in the slip was displaced by the heavier clay, a firmer 
material and better adapted to resist air leakage. 

In this section great care was taken in excavating ahead of the 
hood to be sure that all piles within the area of the tunnel section 
were cut off before coming in contact with the shields. This was 
done to avoid pushing the piles through the ground and leaving back 
of them an open channel for air to escape. These piles extended down 
to the springing line of the tunnel excavation, and as many as 30 had 
to be cut off at one time in advancing the shield the length of one 
ring. In this manner both shields passed under the river bulkhead 
without accident. 

The tunnels then entered the Hudson Kiver silt. The front of the 
shield was completely bulkheaded. Some of the lower pockets in the 
shield were opened to allow a part of the material to enter the tunnel 
as the shield was advanced. The balance of the material in excava- 
tion was displaced bodily. At once it was noticed that there was a 
tendency of the tunnel lining to rise behind the shield. This rising 
always accompanied the movement of the shield ; whenever the shield 
was stopped the rising ceased. The difficult feature at this point was 
that the shield was so heavy that it settled while the cast-iron tunnel 
lining behind the shield rose, so that the shield at all times was below 
grade while the tunnel lining a short distance back was above grade. 

The bulkheads in the shield were moved forward to reduce weight 
by lessening the amount of muck in the shield. This aided somewhat 
in keeping the shield from settling and then more material could be 
taken in through the shield. This procedure lessened the pressure on 
the tunnel behind and reduced its tendency to rise. As the contract 
required that a second tunnel bulkhead should be constructed in this 
vicinity, the south shield was stopped after passing through 218 feet 
of silt and the bulkhead was built. This bulkhead, which is typical 
of all the bulkheads, is a concrete wall 10 feet thick, equipped with 
the usual muck, man and emergency locks, and adds temporarily con- 
siderable weight to the tunnel. 

With this additional weight, the rising of the tunnel was some- 
what checked and after tunneling a distance of 121 feet farther 



THE HOLLAND TUNNEL GRAY AND HAOEN 591 

in the silt the shield entered at the bottom of the sand layer 
which overlies the rock, and thereupon all rising of the completed 
tunnel during shield driving ceased. In the north tunnel, which 
was driven through the same material after the south tunnel was 
built, a larger amount of material was taken in through the shield at 
the start, and while there was some rising of this tunnel behind the 
shield, it was very much less than in the south tunnel. In neither 
tunnel was the movement sufficient to endanger the structure. 

The excavation in tiie part-earth and part-rock section just east of 
the New York river shaft caisson was carried on by driving a short 
bottom heading in advance of the shield, in which was placed a con- 
crete cradle with steel rails embedded in it upon which the shield 
slid. After placing the cradle the rock was blasted out for one or 
two advances of the shield and then the soft material on top was 
carefully excavated and supported b}' poling and breast boards. 

The New York river ventilating shaft caisson was sunk by the 
compressed air method in the river near the New York pierhead line. 
It was built on launching ways, then launched and drydocked. After 
concrete had been placed in the pockets surrounding the working 
chamber, additional steel was erected, carrying it to a height of 55 
feet. 

A platform supported on piles had been built on three sides of the 
site (the south side being open ready to receive the caisson), and the 
caisson was towed to its position on the work. The caisson at that 
time weighed approximately 1,650 tons. Upon arrival, additional 
steel was erected and concrete was placed in the walls, the caisson 
sinking as the additional weight was placed. Care was taken to 
keep the center of gravity as low as possible to maintain the 
necessary stability. When it had reached a depth of 35 feet, the 
cutting edge encountered the river bottom, into which it settled at 
each low tide, and weight was added with sufficient rapidity to over- 
come the tendency to float on the subsequent rising tide. 

No excavation was carried on in the working chamber until the 
cutting edge had penetrated about 9 feet into the mud, as the weight 
of the caisson displaced the material up to this point. Compressed 
air was then introduced into the working chamber and the usual 
shaft mucking operations started. At a depth of G9 feet below mean 
high water, rock was encountered. This was taken out in lifts about 
6 feet deep and the caisson was lowered by successive drops until it 
reached its final position. 

The upper half of the outside of the caisson, or the part which is 
exposed to open water, was covered with water-proofing, which in 
turn was covered with an 18-inch layer of protection concrete. An 
additional protection is afforded in the upper portion by a granite 
facing where the shaft is exposed to tidal action.

THE HOLLAND TUNNEL GRAY AND HAQEN 593 

After the caisson was sealed to the rock ami waterproof, the east 
and west shield bulkheads in botii the north and south tunnel cham- 
bers were burned out and both shields wore driven throup;h the cais- 
son. A timber and concrete cradle of suflicient strenfrth to carry 
the shield was erected in each chamber and the shield jacked across. 
After the shields had proj^ressed a suflicient distance west of the 
river shaft to permit tunnel bulklicads, these were built in each tun- 
nel and placed in operation. After this, tunneling ojierations were 
carried on from the river shaft, releasinj^ the tunnels between the 
land and river shafts for the placiufif of concrete lininj^. 

The caissons for tiie north and south land shafts on the New 
Jersey side were assembled and sinkiiif]: started in the fall of 1922. 
After the cais.sons had passed tiirough the cinder fill of the railroad 
yard, a timber crib lilled with riprap was encountered which made 
excavation extremely diflicult. The timbers had to be sawed or 
chopped into short len<rths and some of the rock broken up. 

The distance between the tubes on the New Jersey side required 
the sinking: of two separate river ventilatin^r shafts. This presented 
a problem duo to depth of the bedrock, 250 foot as compared with 70 
feet on the New York side. It was considered that the silt which 
overlies the bedrock would not afford a satisfactory supj)ort. 

Accordin<jly, it was decided to support the shafts b}' means of 
steel casinj^s 24 inches in diameter, filled with reinforced concrete, 
extendins: from the bottom of the shafts to led*;e rock. They were 
made in lonf]fths of 20 feet, threaded at both ends for couj)linirs. 
Three len^hs were connected and one end lowered into the silt. The 
silt inside the pipe was then loosened by churninrr with a 2,000-pound 
bit, and the mud and water bailed out. Excavation was continued 
in this manner to a depth of approximately 20 feet below the bottom 
of the pipe. The material was firm enoufjh to prevent cavin^; into 
the iiold. Another section of pipe was then added and the entire 
section driven into the hole previously excavated. 

The north tunnel shield east and the south tunnel shield west were 
builL first and started out from their respective caissons. After the 
south tunnel shield west had progressed a sufficient distance to erect 
a tunnel bulkhead, the face of the shield was bulkheaded and the 
roof was removed from the south caisson and the south tunnel shield 
east was erected. As soon as this shield was ready, the roof was 
replaced on the caisson and the shield was started eastward, so that 
at the close of 1923 two shields were tunneling eastward, and one 
westward. 

The method followed in stalling these shields out of the shafts was 
similar to that already described for the New York shields, except 
that here it was not so difficult as there was adequate cover overhead. 
After the roof of the working chamber had been replaced, the 



594 ANNUAL REPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

girders in the side of the caisson, through which the shield was to be 
advanced, were burned out, after which the plates were removed from 
the invert to the springing line. The lower pockets of the shield 
were then bulkheaded and the space between the pockets and and the 
exposed face was filled with clay. After this, the remaining plates 
were removed, proceeding upward from the springing line. A semi- 
circular annular ring was cleared for the hood and packed with clay 
into which the hood was forced when the shield was advanced. 

The material at the face consisted of timber and riprap down to 
the springing line, similar to the material encountered in shaft 
sinking, making excavation very difficult. The stones in the crib 
varied from 1-man stones to those three-quarters of a yard in size. 
The voids between the stones were filled with soft black mud, which 
did not offer sufficient resistance to prevent the escape of air, neces- 
sitating the mudding up of the entire face with clay. As the excava- 
tion was carried forward, the escape of air through the heading of 
the north tunnel at times taxed the full capacity of the power house, 
40,000 cubic feet of free air per minute. 

On June 10, 1923, a small blow occurred at the face of the shield 
and it became necessary to drop the air pressure sufficiently to allow 
the water to flow into the tunnel before the blow could be stopped. 
The progress through the riprap was very slow, as extreme measures 
had to be taken to avoid blow-outs. After the shield had passed 
through the old timber and riprap crib, the river bulkhead was en- 
countered which did not offer any unusual difficulties. 

Before tunneling through similar material in the south tunnel east 
5,500 bags of 1 : 1 Portland cement grout were ejected through the 
east shield bulkhead of the south caisson and six pipes were sunk 
from the surface east of the caisson through which 140 bags of 
1 : 1 Portland cement grout were placed. This grout displaced much 
of the soft mud and filled the voids in the riprap and greatly facili- 
tated the driving of the shield so that very little air escaped through 
this material after it had been consolidated hj grouting. 

After about 60 rings were erected in each tunnel, the shields were 
stopped to build tunnel bulkheads and to install cages at the shafts 
and then tunneling was resumed. Immediately east of the river 
bulkhead soft mud, considerably lighter than Hudson River silt, was 
encountered in the upper part of the excavation. In this material 
the tunnel began to rise directly behind the shield and also to move 
northward. 

To hold the shield and the tunnel to the proper grade, it was 
necessary to take in a certain amount of material through the shield. 
Accordingly, the shield was advanced with the top pockets bulk- 
headed and a large percentage of the excavation was permitted to 
enter the tunnel through openings in the lower part of the shield. 



THE HOLLAND TUNNEL GRAY AND HAGEN 595 

This material had to be entirely removed after each shove before the 
erection of tlic cast-iron lining could proceed and slowed down proor- 
ress. In addition it was desired to retain this material in the tunnel 
directly behind the shield so as to increase the weight of tlie tunnel 
and reduce the tendency to rise. 

To meet this situation a dilTcrent method of tunneling was adopted. 
The work was stopped and a steel bulkhead semicircular in shape and 
fitting into the lower part of the tunnel Avas built to trail about 10 
feet behind the shield, and four iM)ckets of the shield immediately 
above the springing line were equipped with hydraulically operated 
doors. When the shield advanced, these doors were opened varying 
amounts, depending upon conditions, to aUow the material to flow 
through the shield into chutes which cropped the silt back of the 
trailing bulkhead. This method of tunneling permitted both the 
shield and the tunnel to be kept on grade. 

River-shaft caissons were built, launched, floated into position, and 
sunk, as on the New York side. 

On October 22, 1924, shield driving was suspended in the north 
tunnel from the New York side and a bottom heading or junction 
drift was started to meet a corresponding drift from the New Jersey 
heading. On October 29, the rock barrier remaining between these 
headings was blasted away. After this all tunneling operations were 
conducted from the New York side, as the junction was much nearer 
the New York shaft. The south tunnel headings were joined on 
December 7, 1924. Work on the New York side was suspended and 
the New Jersey shield driven to meet the New York shield. 

In July, 1924, the placing of the concrete lining forming the road- 
way and air ducts was started on the New York side in the north and 
south tunnels between the land and river shafts. The concrete invert 
was first placed in both tunnels from the land shafts to the river 
shafts. The remaining concrete was then poured in nine operations. 
Five types of collapsible steel forms in CO-foot sections, afterward 
increased to 75 feet, supported and moved by carriages resting on 
previously placed concrete, were used. 

The approach tunnels from the land shafts to the open approaches 
at Dominick and Hudson Streets, New York City, and at Provost 
Street, Jersey City, were built by the cut and cover method as usually 
employed in subway construction. 

A visitor to the Holland Tunnel in 1921 has written the following 
graphic and interesting storj' of the shield method of construction. 
The invitation to inspect the tunnel read, " Wear old clothes and 
bring your galoshes." 

Such was the admonition of our host on a warm September evening in 1924. 
But knowing our host, we conijilied without ado other than a casual lifting of 
the eyebrows. Ten o'clock that evening found four of us being piloted toward 
Canal Street and the administration building of the Vehicular Tunnel. 



596 ANNUAL. REPORT SMITHSONIAN" INSTITUTION, 19 3 

Chief Engineer Holland himself greeted us, and began an introduction to 
this vast engineering project with maps, diagrams, and more maps and dia- 
grams, till red lines showing tunnels, and blue lines showing traffic lanes, and 
green lines showing river bed swam before our gaze. We nodded very know- 
ingly, mumbled pleasantly that exquisite shades had been chosen for the 
various lines, and moved on to the doctor's office. 

Here we were introduced to the necessary procedure before going into 
compressed-air chambers. Ears, heart, and blood pressure were examined. 
As we were found physically fit, we were passed on to the wardrobe, where 
we were presented with an assortment of khalci cover-alls and left to our own 
discretion as to choice. 

The first twinge of squeamishuess about cleanliness was quickly dispelled 
by the romatic second thought that the very men who were performing this mir- 
acle under the river had worn these self-same garments. Then followed a 
scramble for the most bespattered on the theory that such muck was a mark 
of courage in dashing into subaqueous passages. Size was completely disre- 
garded. Never in all the stages of dressing up to set forth for adventure in 
my childhood days had I enjoyed more of a thrill as so arrayed we followed 
our guides to the tunnel entrance. 

Once inside we were amazed to find what a simple form such a complex 
sounding work could assume. The tubes are made of cast-iron segments bolted 
together. Fourteen of these sections are required to make a complete ring. 
PJach section weighs 1^2 tons and is held in place by huge bolts weighing 10 
pounds. 

" Oh's " and "Ah's " were vented as we continued our way to see the actual 
excavating. We passed groups of men sitting about talking, laughing, and 
playing cards, awaiting their shifts. Work was never stopped 24 hours a day, 
7 days a week. (With an investment of $42,000,(KX), it was imi)erative that no 
time be lost.) We met car after car of excavated material on its way down the 
temporary tracks to the entrance and out to be dumped. 

At last we arrived at the great concrete bulkhead that sealed the compressed- 
air section, separating it from the completed portion of the tunnel. 

The bulkhead contained four air chambers or locks. Two large compartments 
at the bottom of the bulkhead were equipped with tracks for bringing supplies 
to the workers and for removing the excavated material. Two smaller cham- 
bers were provided in the upper section for the workmen who on entering and 
leaving the tunnel must be gradually brought from one pressure to another. 

We entered one of these (only one was used normally, the other reserved 
for emergencies) and saw the iron door clanged to and fastened. Then followed 
lessons in equalizing the pressure inside and outside the head by holding the 
nose and " snorting " — very much as one does when trying to expel water from 
the nose after diving. The danger of the " caving in " of one's eardrums 
was stressed, and we were warned to hold up our hand the moment the pressure 
became too severe. This was the only way to attract the attention of the man 
who turned on the compressed air, as the noise made even shouting inaudible. 

We sat wild-eyed, expecting the hideous monster to leap upon us any minute. 
The bark was worse than the bite. Twice we raised our hand and the pressure 
was turned ofE until the pressure in our ears was relieved. When the 29-pound 
mark was reached the door leading into tlie high-pressure section was opened, 
and there we were in the very midst of the digging. 

Once accustomed to the pressure, it was not noticeable, and we began a 
siege of questions about the actual excavating. 

This work was done under a shield, or movable head, slightly larger than 
the external diameter of the tunnel. The <iliicld was forced forward 2% feet

at a time, the width of a section, by means of 30 liydraulic jacks supported 
against the end of the tunnel alrojidy liuilt. Several of the jacks were then 
removed and a segment was hoisted into place by a tremendous erector arm 
till a complete ring had been added, and then the shield was forced ahead 
again. Doors in the lower part of the shield allowed about 30 per cent of 
the displaced compressed silt to enter the tunnel on each shove. 

We stood watching the big burly men as they shoveled the df-bri.s into the 
cars that carried It out through the lower air chambers. Not particularly 
envious of them at such hard labor, we listened only half-heartedly to our 
guide until he remarked that the automobiles we had seen parked at the 
entrance belonged to these very " .=and-hogs '* ; that they miide high wages 
and worked short hours. There are laws forbidding their working In com- 
pressed air for more than two hours at a time for health reasons. Law like- 
wise requires the company emi)loying the men t<) furnish hot showers and hot 
coffee for them when they come out. 

From the digging wo turned to watch the erector ; two men tugging at a 
mammoth wrench tightening the bolts : the grouting machine as It forced its 
mixture with pressure beyond the segments to form a concrete shell for the 
whole tube; and then to discuss the miracle that prevented the Hudson itself 
from pouring in on us in one deluge. There we stood with only a few feet of 
sand and gravel between us and the river. 

"Chief" Holland and the rest of the engineers chatted with us as casually 
as if it were a game of tiddle-de-winks they were explaining, instead of an 
aclilevement that even seeing denied believing. We picked up bits of rock for 
souvenirs and continued gasping when one of our hosts turned questioner. He 
asked if we could whistle. 

Assuring him that whistling did not stump the modern girl, we inquired his 
preference as to a tune. He consulted the other men. and after much deliber- 
ation proposed to give us a big party on the condition that we whistle "Yankee 
Doodle" — all five verses. W^ith one accord lips were puckered and cheeks 
distended. Our chagrin was only equaled by the laughter of our tormentors 
as we puffed and blew in vain. The party was given for effort and not for the 
results obtained against 20 pounds of pressure. 

In quitting the compressed air it was necessary to put on fleece-lined coats 
to prevent catching cold. We retraced our steps through the man lock, where 
the pressure was reduced gradually back through the tube, and insisted on the 
law requirement of hot coffee on signing off. 

The problem of ventilation of the Holland Tunnel was unlike any 
heretofore solved, both in character and magnitude. The only exist- 
ing vehicular tunnels even approximately comparable to the Holland 
Tunnel are the Blackball and Rotherhithe Tunnels under the Thames 
at London. 

The Blackwall, opened for traffic in 1897, has an under-river length 
of 1,221 feet between shafts. It consists of a single tube 27 feet in 
diameter with a roadway accommodating one line of traffic in each 
direction and two sidewalks. Traffic counts in 1920 showed that the 
maximum number of motor vehicles using the tunnel was less than 
100 per hour. 

The Rotherhithe is 30 feet in diameter, similar to the Blackwall 
in traffic facilities, with an under-river length between shafts of 1,570 
28095—31 39 



598 ANKUAIi EEPOBT SMITHSONIAIT INSTITUTION, 19 3 

feet. Both of these tunnels are ventilated by the natural movement of 
air through the shafts and portals. The Holland Tunnel, with a total 
length of 9,250 feet, an under-river length of 5,480 feet, and a capacity 
of 1,900 vehicles per hour in each direction, or 46,000 per day, obvi- 
ously required something more than natural ventilation. To this 
end the ventilation of the tunnel was studied under three heads : 

1. The amount and composition of exliaust gases from motor vehicles. 

2. The dilution necessary to render the exhaust gases harmless. 

3. The method and equipment necessary for adequate ventilation. 

The impurities in the atmosphere of a tunnel used by motor vehicles 
are the product of the combustion of gasoline. If complete combus- 
tion occurred, the carbon content in the gasoline would be in the 
form of carbon dioxide, which can be tolerated in considerable quan- 
tity without injurious effects. In a gasoline engine, however, com- 
plete combustion seldom, if ever, takes place. The exhaust gases 
contain varying amounts of carbon monoxide, depending on such 
variable factors as the quality of the gasoline, conditions of car- 
buretion, etc. 

Carbon monoxide is a highly poisonous gas, injurious to health in 
minute quantities if breathed for a long time, and if present in large 
quantities is injurious even when breathed for a short time. Venti- 
lation requirements are determined by the quantity of this gas in 
exhaust gases. If sufficient fresh air is supplied to reduce this gas to 
a safe percentage, other gases and impurities, such as carbon dioxide, 
methane, and smoke, will also be diluted sufficiently. The first con- 
sideration, therefore, was to determine the amount of carbon mon- 
oxide that would be liberated in the tunnel. 

Investigations were carried out at the Bureau of Mines experiment 
station at Pittsburgh. The schedule called for the testing of pas- 
senger cars and trucks of various makes and capacities. The tests 
were made with cars loaded and light, standing with engine racing 
and idling, accelerating from rest on level grade and on maximum 
grade, running at 3, 6, 10, and 15 miles per hour on level and up and 
down a grade of 3i/2 P^r cent, corresponding to the maximum tunnel 
grade. A total of 101 cars were tested. Gas samples were taken 
directly from the exhaust pipe throughout the entire duration of 
the test. 

In general, the results showed that the exhaust gases contained 
about 6.8 per cent carbon monoxide and 8.4 per cent carbon dioxide, 
developing only 67 per cent of the heat value of the gasoline. About 
one-third of the gasoline fuel was wasted through incomplete 
combustion. 

Experiments to determine the proper dilution to render the 
exhaust gases harmless were conducted at the Bureau of Mines 
experiment station at Yale. They were performed in a gas-tight 



THE HOLLAND TUNNEL GRAY AND HAGEN 599 

chamber of 22G cubic feet capacity. Members of the staff spent 
periods of one hour in air containing amounts of carbon monoxide 
varying from 2 to 10 parts in 10,000. In addition, tests were per- 
formed in a chamber of 12,000 cubic feet with an automobile en- 
gine exhausting into the chamber. The duration of all tests was 
one hour, whereas the length of time required to travel through the 
tunnel at a speed of only 3 miles per hour is but 31 minutes. 

The results of the test showed that when an automobile engine 
is running properly the exhaust contains no substance that is in- 
jurious to any appreciable extent excejjt carbon monoxide. Gasoline 
engines with cylinders missing, or when cold, over-supplied with oil 
or gasosline, or smoking from any cause, may throw off disagreeable 
vapoi"s irritating to the eyes and nauseating to some i)ersons. 

The physiological effects of carbon monoxide are wholly due to 
the union of this gas with the hemoglobin of the blood. To the 
extent that hemoglobin is combined with carbon monoxide, it is by 
that amount incapable of transporting oxygen to the body. This 
combination of carbon monoxide with the hemoglobin is reversible, 
so that when a person returns to fresh air the carbon monoxide 
is gradually eliminated. 

Of all physical signs and tests of carbon monoxide poisoning, 
headache proved the most definite and reliable. Concentration of 
gas too weak or periods of exposure too short to induce a headache 
are to be considered harmless. No one had this symptom to an 
appreciable degree after a period of one hour in the chamber with 
four parts of carbon monoxide. With six parts the effect was usually 
very slight, while with eight parts there was decided discomfort for 
some hours. 

Hence a uniform concentration of four parts carbon monoxide 
in 10,000 of air is designed to afford not only complete safety, but 
also comfort and freedom from disagreeable effects. 

By the longitudinal method of ventilation, the entire tunnel would 
be utilized as a duct for conveying air through the tunnel. Sufficient 
air would be supplied through blower fans near one portal and would 
enter the tunnel through a nozzle or nozzles at a velocity sufficient to 
force it through its entire length. 

If in a 29-foot tunnel the air were introduced into the north tube 
near one portal through a nozzle having a cross-sectional area of 74 
square feet, and were exhaust<id through the opposite portal, the air 
would h^ve a nozzle velocity of about 282 miles per hour. This 
would produce a velocity of 72 miles per hour at points where the 
roadway was occupied by a pleasure car and a truck abreast, or a 
velocity of 51 miles per hour where there were no vehicles. Such air 
velocities would be prohibitive in a vehicular tunnel, and the power 
required to handle the air would be excessive.

ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 



In the distributive method of ventilation adopted for the Holland 
Tunnel, the air is introduced into and exhausted from the tunnel 
through a number of openings at frequent intervals leading from the 
tunnel roadway. By this method fresh air is supplied at all points 
throughout the tunnel. The air at any point can be controlled. 
There is no discomfort or danger from high-velocity air currents. 
The ventilation is not affected by traffic or the direction of the wind. 
Exhaust gases are quickly diluted and removed. 

The space above and below the tunnel roadway is ideally suitable 
for air ducts. Fresh air, supplied by blower fans at the shafts, is 
discharged from the main duct under the roadway through adjustable 
openings into continuous expansion chambers on each side, thence 




Figure 3. — Cross section 



lube or llolhind Tunnel 



through a continuous slot into the roadway. The air remains in the 
tunnel an average of li/^ minutes as it slowly ascends . ' the ceiling. 

Exhaust fans located in the same buildings with the blower fans 
draw the vitiated air through ports in the ceiling and thence through 
the upper duct above the roadway, delivering it through stacks to 
the outer atmosphere. 

Experiments to determine the coefficient of friction for flow of air

required for moving air through a duct from which air is taken off 



THE HOLLAND TUNNEL — GRAY AND HAQEN 601 

at intervals, and to determine the power losses in bends or elbows 
in concrete air ducts were conducted at the engineering experiment 
station at the University of Illinois. 

A concrete model, the linear dimensions of which were one-half 
those of tlie lower duct of the tunnel, and 300 feet in length was used 
for direct tests. Outlets with adjustable shutters to control the flow 
of air were provided at uniform int^irvals on each side. Measure- 
ments of air velocity and static pressure were made at three locations 
in the duct, one 5 feet from each end and one midway. Tests were 
run with all side ports closed and port pockets open at various inter- 
vals, and with air velocities ranging from 1,000 feet to G,000 feet per 
minute. A total of 18G blowing tests and 17 exhausting tests were 
run from which to determine the coellicient of friction. 

On a full-size model of the expansion chamber proposed for tlie 
tunnel, tests were made to determine the proper shape of the chamber 
and tiie shape and size of the slot which would give a direction of air 
flow high enough not to raise dust from the roadway and low enough 
not to short circuit the fresh air to the inlets into the vitiated air duct 
over the roadway. These experiments also gave the minimum static 
pressure required to discharge the requisite quantities of air through 
the slots at difl'erent locations in the tunnel. A total of 112 tests were 
made on various shapes of expansion chambers and various widths of 
slot under the several conditions to be met in the tunnel. 

Experiments on elbows were made in two parts : On galvanized 
iron single and comj^ound elbows constructed to one-tenth the in- 
terior dimensions of the elbows to be used in the tunnel, and on con- 
crete compound elbows to one-half the interior dimensions of those 
planned for the tunnel ducts. 

To verify under tunnel conditions the amount of carbon monoxide 
produced by automobiles and the physiological efl'ect of exhaust 
gases, an experimental tunnel was constructed in the workings of a 
coal mine at Bruceton, Pa. It was located about 1,000 feet from the 
entrance to the mine and about 135 feet from the surface. The 
tunnel had a driveway 8 feet by 9 feet wide, with continuous air 
ducts above tiie ceiling and below the roadway. It was oval in 
plan, with a major axis of approximately 135 feet and a minor axis 
of approximately 110 feet, giving a roadway length of 400 feet. 

Air for He tost was supplied by the mine fan, belt-connected to a 
steam engine and operated outside the mines. The fan operated 
normally exhausting, giving upward ventilation in the tunnel. 
Downward ventilation was accom[)lished by reversing the direction 
of the air currents through the reversible housing of the fan, which 
then operated as a blower. 

In the upward ventilation system, air entered the duct under the 
roadway, passed through adjustable [un-i openings into the con- 



602 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

tinuous expansion chambers on either side of the roadway, thence 
into the driveway. In the downward system, air was delivered to 
the duct in the ceiling, thence through the ports into the upper ex- 
pansion chambers from which it entered the roadway. 

A total of 17 tests were run with cars varying in number from 
1 to 8, with concentrations of carbon monoxide in the driveway from 
0.5 to 9.4 in 10,000 parts of air, at various temperatures and humid- 
ities, and various methods of transverse ventilation. The tests veri- 
fied the earlier conclusions, and demonstrated that with upward 
ventilation the exhaust gases crossed the breathing plane of per- 
sons in the tunnel but once, while with downward ventilation they 
crossed this plane twice. There was also a lower concentration of 
carbon monoxide with upward than with downward ventilation. 

Valuable and necessary as were the experiments required to de- 
termine the various factors involved in the problem of adequate 
ventilation for the Holland Tunnel, the data resulting from these 
preliminary investigations had to be crystallized into tangible units 
of ventilating equipment. 

These are the 84 giant Sturtevant Silentvane fans which are the 
very lungs of the tunnel. Without such fans blowing in fresh air 
and exhausting the vitiated air the tunnel could not be made to 
function. 

The Sturtevant Silentvane fans are installed in the ventilation 
buildings, of which there are two on each side of the river, one at 
the pierhead line and the other inland. Each land shaft ventilates 
four sections of tunnel, the adjoining portal sections of each tube, 
the whole intermediate section to the pierhead shaft where traffic is 
on a downgrade, and one-half of the parallel section where it is on 
an upgrade. The buildings over these shafts contain four indepen- 
dent sets of blower and exhaust fans. The pierhead shafts ventilate 
three sections of tunnel, one-half of each of the 3,400-foot river sec- 
tions and one-half of the intermediate section where traffic is on the 
upgrade. In all there are 14 sets of blowers and 14 sets of exhaust 
fans. Dividing the upgrade sections of the tunnels into three parts 
gives added ventilation where the greatest amount of carbon monox- 
ide is expected. 

There are 28 ducts — 14 blower and 14 exhaust, connecting the va- 
rious sections of the tunnels with the ventilating buildings. Each 
duct is equipped with three fans, two of which, when operated to- 
gether, will supply the maximum quantity of air required. Their 
capacities range from 81,000 to 227,000 cubic feet per minute and 
they operate at static pressures varying from 0.6 to 3.75 inches of 
water. This range in pressure and capacity is due to the great 
difference in length of tunnel ventilated by different sets, those at 
the outside of the pierhead shafts having 1,700 feet to serve while

the inside fans have only 700 or 800 feet. These fans, during an 
hour of heavy traffic, -will handle 84,000 tons of air, or 1,400 tons per 
minute. They provide for changing the air in the tunnel 42 times 
per hour. 

The fans are of the backward curved-blade type. Under diflFer- 
ent conditions, one, two, or three fans may be operated on one tunnel 
duct at anv one time.

They are electrically driven by wound-rotor motors with resist- 
ance in the circuit to make it possible to run them at variable speeds. 
The combined capacities of the motors is approximately G,000 horse- 
power, two-thirds of which will be in operation at times of maximum 
load and one-third in reserve. Chain drives are to be used to make 
possible speed adjustments or changes in the motors as well as on 
account of the space limitations in the ventilating buildings. 



604 ANNUAL KEPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

The placing of the fans is varied to suit the local conditions in the 
individual buildings. Generally, the exhaust ducts are at the corners 
of the buildings and suj^ply ducts are in the central portion. Con- 
sequently the compartments containing the exhaust fans are located 
near the corners under the exhaust stacks, leaving the central por- 
tions of the fan floors free for intake fans, and the central section of 
each outer wall for the air intakes. The intakes are made sufficiently 
large to give low velocities through the louvres. 

The louvre blades are made of heavy wire glass to give light to the 
interior of the buildings as they take up most of the space otherwise 
available for windows. Heavy bronze screens protect them and also 
serve to keep out birds. 

The arrangement whereby fresh air is drawn in through louvres 
high up on the sides of the buildings and exhaust air is forced out 
through stacks which extend 20 feet above the roof insures a complete 
separation of fresh and vitiated air. 

The intake fans and their motors are situated in the open portions 
of the fan floors where they are accessible. The exhaust fans are, of 
necessity, inside of chambers at the top of the ducts. Their motors, 
however, are out on the main floor, the drive shafts being run in to 
the fans through close-fitting collars in the side plates of the duct. 
Access to the fans is provided through air locks equipped with air- 
tight doors which can be opened against the unequal pressure by 
wedge latches which force the doors open sufficiently to break the 
seal. 

Each duct is equipped with a damper which may be closed when 
the fan is shut down so that air from the other fans will not be short- 
circuited through the idle fan. These dampers are motor operated 
from the control room and are equipped with limit switches. 

An unusually flexible system of power supply has been worked 
out based on the facts that all the motors are in groups of three, also 
that the maximum power equipments are less than the capacity of 
the minimum size power cables installed by the local companies. 
Three cables from the New York side and three from the New Jersey 
side are run to the bus bars in each ventilating building, thus giving 
one motor in each set a separate cable connection to power supply on 
each side of the river. Interconnection at the bus bars makes it pos- 
sible to cut in any or all motors on each cable. Thus connected, each 
motor may be supplied with power by six independent cables, each 
capable of carrying the entire tunnel load ; and, as there are at least 
two independent sources of power at each end of the tunnel, con- 
tinuity of power supply is absolutely assured. 

As the transformers are located in the ventilating buildings where 
smoke from an oil fire might be drawn into the ventilating system, 
air-cooled instead of oil-cooled transformers are used. 



THE HOLLAND TUNNEL OKAY AND UAGEN G05 

Each fun is provided with ji coiiti'ol switch at the motor for 
emerj^ency or re[)iiir use. Further hx-ul control is provided at the 
switchboard in each ventihiting buildinjz;, and complete operating 
control is provided at the main switchboartl in tiic administration 
buildinjj: where, by a system of si<:nal li{j;hts, it will be possible, at 
all times, to tell what motors are in operation. 

Air from the intake fans is forced down into the lon<ritudinal 
duct under the roathvay of the tunnel. From there it is fed through 
flues 10 to 15 feet apart into a continuous expansion chamber above 
the curb line at eacii side of the roadway, the flow of air into this 
chamber being controlled by adjustable slides over the flue openings. 
The outer side of the expansion chamber is a copper-steel plate 
which can be adjusted to give an opening of widths varying from 
34 inches to K^4 inches through which fresh air flows into the 
tunnel. 

Vitiated air is drawn off through openings through the ceiling 
into the exhaust ducts. These openings are spaced 10 to 15 feet 
apart and are from 3 to 6 feet long. They, also, are provided with 
slides by which the opening can be adjusted to meet the local re- 
(piirements for air circulation. 

By this arrangement of supply and exhaust ports, fresh air sup- 
plied to the roadway mixes with the warmer gases and rises to the 
ceiling where the exhaust ports are located. 

There will be no longitudinal movement of air in the tunnels 
except that induced by the movement of vehicles, nor will there 
be any objectionable winds such as would be created by longitudinal 
ventilation. Tests made with smoke bombs showed that even large 
quantities of smoke will not spread far from the point of origin, 
but will rise quickly to the ceiling and be taken out. Similiarly, 
in case of a fire the hot gasses will rise to the ceiling, where they 
will be drawn off. There will not be the same danger of spreading 
t)ie fire from car to car as there would be with longitudinal 
ventilation. 

As part of the studies for the ventilating equipment, numerous 
tests in relation to fire were made, both in the test tunnel at Bruce- 
ton and at the laboratories of manufacturers of fire-fighting equip- 
ment. These tests included the burning of an automobile drenched 
with gasoline and with gasoline spilling from a hole in the tank 
on the car to determine how quickly such a fire could be put out 
with the hand extinguishers to be placed in the tunnel. 

As a check upon the air conditions in the tunnel, automatic carbon 
monoxide recording devices are installed in each exhaust duct which 
will make a continuous analysis of the gases and record it graphically 
in the control room of the administration building in New York. 
There, by observing the chart, the operator can increase or decrease 
the fresh-air supply as traffic conditions change in the tunnel.

THE HOLLAND TUNNEL GRAY AND HAGEN 607 

That the construction of the Holhind Tunnel was no easy task is 
evidenced by the f^voat increase in both time and money required for 
its completion. The original plans called for an expenditure of ap- 
proximately $28,000,000 and for completion in 1924, or three and one- 
half years. Actual expentlitures have run 50 per cent greater, and as 
this is written, the opening will not be until the fall of 1927. 

Yet this is not surprising. Although the shield method of con- 
struction has been described in this story as if it were a relatively 
simple operation, many difficulties had to be overcome in bringing 
tlie work to a successful conclusion. The proceedings involved in tlie 
taking of real property at entrances and exits, changes in the grades 
of streets, the closing of a portion of Eleventh Street in Jersey City, 
negotiations with the railroads at the Jersey City end for the acquisi- 
tion of parts of tlie railroad yards, all took time. It was not always 
easy to harmonize the views of the State Commissions. Alterations 
necessarily had to be made in the preliminary plans as further infor- 
mation resulted from investigation and experience. 

That the undertaking cost the lives of its first two chief engineers, 
not from accident, but from the drain on their vital energy, is perhaps 
the most striking evidence of the magnitude of the undertaking.

JESSE WALTER FEWKES ' 



By John R. Swantun and F. II. II. Roberts, Jr. 



[With 1 plate] 

The death of Jesse Walter Fewkes removes one who was an out- 
standinf]^ influence in the formative period of American archeology, 
particularly the archeology of our great Southwest. ^le wo' born 
at Newton, Mass., on November 14, 1850, of parents whose i*..cestral 
lines in America extended back to the seventeenth century. In 1871 
he entered Harvard and he graduated four years later with honors in 
natural history, besides being elected to membership in Phi Beta 
Kappa. 

In 1874, while he was still an undergraduate, two papers on elec- 
trical subjects were published by him, but the year before he had 
come under the influence of Louis Agassiz in the latter's school at 
Penikcse Island, Buzzards Bay, and this experience probably led 
him to turn his atteniion wholly to zoology. At any rate he took up 
graduate work in natural history and, after receiving the degrees of 
A. M. and Ph. D. in 1877, he continued zoological studies at Leipzig 
under Rudolph Lueckart between 1878 and 1880. Later he spent 
several months in Naples and at Villa Franca on the south coast of 
France as holder of the Harris fellowship. After his return to 
America he received an appointment as assistant in the Museum of 
Comparative Zoology at Harvard where, from 1881 to 1889, he had 
charge of the collections of the lower invertebrata. In 1881 he ac- 
companied Alexander Agassiz to Key West and the Dry Tortugas 
for the study of marine life and two years later he visited the Ber- 
mudas on a similar quest. Every summer, from 1884 to 1887, he was 
assistant in charge of the younger Agassiz's marine laboratory at 
Newport, R. I., but in the spring of 1887 he pursued scientific studies 
at Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz and Monterey, California, as a guest 
of Augustus Homenway, of Bo.ston. and in the summer of 1888 he 
studied in Paris and engaged in field work in marine zoology at 
Prof. Lacaze Duthier's zoological station at RoscolF, Brittany. 

Doctor Fewkes's visit to California proved to be a turning point 
in his career, for it was then that he came in contact with the culture

of the Pueblo Indians, which excited in him an interest still further 
stimulated by the enthusiasm of Mrs. Mary Hemenway. In 1889 and 
1890 he undertook field work among the Zuui Indians of New Mexico, 
and in the latter year he made use of a phonograph — ^the first time, 
it is believed, that it was so employed — in the recording of Indian 
music. In 1891 be became director of the Hemenway Southwestern 
Archeological Expedition and editor of the Journal of American 
Archeology and Ethnology, established to publish the results of its 
investigations. During the same year he began those studies of Hopi 
ceremonials for which he became especially noted and which probably 
constitute his most enduring contribution to American anthropology. 

These investigations were greatly facilitated by his initiation into 
the Antelope and Flute priesthoods. The happy relationship thus 
established enabled him to witness many secret rites from which the 
ordinary observer was barred and his descriptions of many of the 
ceremonials were the first to be published. His account of the Hopi 
snake dance, which appeared in 1894, was a pronounced factor in 
spreading the knowledge of this striking rite and stimulating popular 
interest in it. In the following years he prepared additional reports 
on various phases of it and although innumerable papers on the sub- 
ject have been written in recent years, his works still furnish the 
background and source of information for many of the descriptions 
of the ceremony. 

The Hemenway expedition having been invited by the Spanish 
Government to participate in the historical exposition held at Madrid 
in 1892-93 to commemorate the discovery of America by Columbus, 
Doctor Fewkes was given charge of the exhibit and he was a member 
of the jury of awards. In recognition of these services he was 
honored by Maria Cristina, queen regent of Spain, with the decora- 
tion " Isabel la Catolica," grade of knight. In 1894 King Oscar of 
Sweden presented him with a gold medal, " Litteris et Artibus," for 
his work in anthropology. 

After returning to America, Doctor Fewkes resumed investiga- 
tions in the Southwest, but they were soon brought to an end tempo- 
rarily by the death of his patroness, Mrs. Hemenway, in 1894. The 
collections made under his direction during this period are in the 
Peabody Museum at Cambridge. 

In May, 1895, Doctor Fewkes received an appointment as ethnol- 
ogist in the Bureau of American Ethnology at Washington along 
with the honorary title of collaborator in the division of ethnology 
in the United States National Museum, and the connection which 
he established with the bureau at this time continued unbroken until 
his resignation and retirement from active service in 1928. 

This constituted a turning point in his career in another direction 
because, although he continued to publish the results of his work 



FEWKES — SWANTON AND EGBERTS 611 

among the living Hopi for many years afterward, his field excur- 
sions now became mainly archeological. From 1895 until 1901 the 
scene of these investigations was in and near the Hopi country in 
Arizona. 

It was during the summer of 1895 that he made a survey of the 
ruins along the Rio Verde and excavated at the Hopi ruins of 
Awatobi and Sikyatki. His collection of specimens from the latter 
sites contains some of the finest examples of the ceramic art ever 
found in the Southwest. While conducting the Sikyatki investiga- 
tions Doctor Fewkes fostered the beginnings of a renaissance in 
Hopi pottery making. Nampeo, a young woman from the village 
of Hano, was a constant visitor at the scene of the excavations and 
was so fascinated by the beauty of the pottery being unearthed that 
she began copying the forms and style of decoration. As a result 
of Doctor Fewkes' encouragement and advice she was so successful in 
her endeavors that other women turned to the ancient wares for 
their inspiration. From that time to the present day the pottery 
made in the various villages has been distinctly of the Sikyatki style. 

The field seasons of 1896 and 1897 were spent in the Little Colo- 
rado and upper Gila districts. The excavations conducted at that time 
furnished data for the most elaborate and extensive reports yet 
printed on the region. Doctor Fewkes had no sooner reached the 
field in 1898 than the whole Hopi area was swept by an epidemic of 
smallpox and he was forced to return to Washington. 

In the autumn of 1899 his attention was temporarily diverted from 
archeological researches when he returned to the Hopi villages to 
complete some of the ethnological studies begun in earlier years. He 
spent the winter living with the Indians and obtained much valuable 
information which appeared in subsequent reports on their cere- 
monies. The spring of 1900 found him continuing his reconnaissance 
of Arizona ruins. The following year was devoted to a study of the 
information obtained in the field and the preparation of a report 
on his work. He did find time, however, to make a trip into western 
Texas and northern Chihuahua, Mexico, during the summer of 1901. 
While in Mexico he visited the ruins known as Casas Grandes and 
made what at that time was the most critical and extensive study of 
them ever attempted. 

As a result of the Spanish-American War considerable popular and 
scientific interest was focused on Cuba, Porto Rico, and the West 
Indies, and Doctor Fewkes was among those who desired to conduct 
investigations in the area. Accordingly he devoted portions of the 
years 1902, 1903, and 1904 to researches in the islands. The region 
furnished him much in the way of specimens and information and he 
was able to prepare an extensive report dealing with his discoveries. 



612 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

The season of 1905 found him carrying his investigations to the main- 
land and doing work in northeastern Mexico. 

With the passage of the Lacey Act in 1906 providing for the crea- 
tion of public parks or national monuments a new era dawned in the 
history of Southwestern archeology, and the services of Doctor 
Fewkes were at once enlisted by the Department of the Interior for 
the exploration and restoration of ruins upon the public domain. In 
1906 and 1907 he explored and repaired the famous Casa Grande 
ruins of southern Arizona, but in 1908 transferred his labors to the 
Mesa Verde National Park in southwestern Colorado and continued 
there through the field season of 1909. The Avork of the latter two 
expeditions consisted of the excavation and repair of the two large 
clilf dwellings called Spruce-Tree House and Cliff Palace. His re- 
ports, magazine articles, and lectures on these spectacular ruins at- 
tracted many visitors to the park and greatly simulated public inter- 
est in the subject of Southwestern archeology. 

In 1909 and 1910 he visited large undescribed cliffhouses in the 
Navaho National Monument, northern Arizona, and prepared a pub- 
lication on them. This turned the attention of archeologists to the 
region and in the years immediately following several expeditions 
were sent out from various institutions to conduct investigations in 
the ruins. 

In 1911, he returned to the West Indies, visiting Cuba, the Isle of 
Pines and Grand Cayman, and, in 1912, the Lesser Antilles, but the 
following spring he w^ent to Europe where he spent part of his time 
studying the West Indian collections in German and Danish museums. 
While in Europe at this time he made a trip to Egypt in order that 
he might observe the methods employed by the egyptologists in their 
excavations. He was especially interested in the technique of repair 
which they had developed and was able to adapt certain features of 
it to his later work in the Southwest. 

The summer of 1914 found him again in the Southwest, This time 
his activities were centered in the Mimbres Valley in southwestern 
New Mexico and as a result of his investigations the highly pictorial 
form of ceramic decoration peculiar to the region became generally 
known. Publication of papers on this pottery led many institutions 
to send parties into that field. Digging there has continued 
unabated to the present day. 

The summer of 1915 was spent on the Mesa Verde in southern Colo- 
rado. During the season two ruins, Sun Temple and Oak-Tree 
House, were uncovered. Sun Temple, because of its unusual shape 
and indications that it had been erected solely for ceremonial pur- 
poses, attracted a great amount of attention and illustrated articles 
about it were printed by many newspapers and magazines throughout

the country. No sin^jle ruin on the mesa onu«j:ht the public fancy as 
did Sun Teniplc and up to tlie time of his with(hawal from active 
participation in archeok)gical affairs Doctor Fewkes was caUed upon 
to answer many letters of inquiry refj^ardinj; the structure. 

Early in the liikl season of lOlG, Doctor Fewkes returned to the 
Hopi country in Arizona with the hope that he might locate some 
of the villages which Indian traditions attributed to clan migra- 
tions during the period antedating the founding of the Hopi towns. 
From there he worked eastward into western New Mexico and con- 
ducted a reconnaissance in the vicinity of Gallup. Completing his 
survey of the ruins in that section he proceeded to Mesa Verde where 
the remainder of the season was devoted to conducting excavations in 
the Mummy Lake group of ruins. The remains of the pueblo struc- 
ture uncovei-ed were given the name Far View house. This piece of 
work was considered important because it showed that there was no 
outstanding difference between the houses built in the large natural 
caverns and those erected on the mesa tops. At the close of the work 
on the mesa Doctor Fewkes made a trip into the Uintah reservation in 
eastern Utah for the purpose of determining the noithern limits of 
the pueblo cultures. On this survey he observed and reported many 
tower and house ruins which previously liad been unknown. 

In 1017 he spent the field season conducting a rocoPinaissaiice in 
the McElmo district of southwestern Colorado. This was done in 
an effort to discover, if possible, what the relation between the many 
towers and circular structures of that section and the Sun Temple 
ruin might be. He found little of help in that respect but did estab- 
lish the fact that most of the ruins scattered throughout the area were 
comparable to the ruin on the mesa which he called Far View House. 
The problems involved became so intricate that lie returned to the 
same region in 1918 and continued his survey in an effort to obtain 
further information. As a result of this he was able to postulate 
the development of the great conununal dwellings out of small house 
and village clusters. Curiously enough, at that time neither he nor 
other investigators in the Southwest placed much emphasis on this 
theory of the evolution of the house. The work of recent yours con- 
ducted by younger men has shown that his idea was a sound one and 
that he had foreseen what excavation has actually shown. 

On March 1, 1918, Doctor Fewkes was appointed chief of the 
bureau of which he had so long been an active member. However, 
this appointment scarcely interrupted the course of his field investi- 
gations. 

In 1919 he continued his work on Mesa Verde excavating the ruin 
known as Square Tower House and the remains of a pit dwelling 
which was designated Earth Lodge A. The latter was interesting

because it was one of the first of that type brought to light in the 
Southwest. Since then many pit houses have been located and un- 
covered and the type has become widely known. 

The summer of 1920 was devoted to the excavation of additional 
ruins on Mesa Verde. The most outstanding of these was the one 
which Doctor Fewkes called New Fire Temple. It is considered one 
of the most remarkable cliff dwellings in the park, if not in the 
whole Southwest. Like Sun Temple, it had been erected purely for 
ceremonial usage and from the evidence he obtained in uncovering it 
Doctor Fewkes was convinced that it had been dedicated to the 
sacred fire and probably to a form of fire worship. The other ruins 
investigated that season were Cedar-Tree Tower and Painted Kiva 
House. 

The following season, 1921, he completed the excavation of Far 
View House, repaired and capped its walls to protect them from the 
weather and also repaired and capped the walls of Sun Temple. 
During the course of his investigations in the Southwest, beginning 
with his work at Casa Grande in Arizona, Doctor Fewkes always 
made it a point to repair and protect the ruins which he exca- 
vated. So persistent was he in his belief that ruins should be pro- 
tected once they were uncovered and so untiring was his advocacy 
of that pratice that in the course of time most of the institutions 
engaged in extensive work in the region followed his lead. 

The field seasons of 1921 and 1922 were the last ones which 
Doctor Fewkes spent at Mesa Verde. His work then consisted of 
the excavation and repair of several small ruins, Pipe Shrine House 
and One Clan House being the most significant. Both represent 
an earlier stage of development than that of the large cliff-dwellings 
und furnished him with data upon which to draw conclusions con- 
cerning the sequence of building types in the park. 

At the beginning of his work on the Mesa Verde Doctor Fewkes 
started a custom which became popular with the visitors to the 
park. Each night a group would gather around his camp fire and 
he would tell them of the Indians, of his finds, of his views and ideas 
concerning the ruins which he was excavating. With the passing of 
the years the number of visitors rapidly increased and a special 
place had to be provided for the evening camp fire so that all who 
were desirous of hearing the talks might attend. As a result of 
this Doctor Fewkes had a tremendous influence in arousing an 
interest in the story of the Southwest and creating an appreciation 
for the excavators and their problems. 

The creation of the Hovenweep National Monument, including the 
McElmo district in Colorado, in 1923 and the Wupatki National 
Monument in Arizona in 1925 may be attributed to Doctor Fewkes' 
untiring efforts to have those districts set aside and preserved by the 
Government. 



FEWKES — SWANTON AND ROBERTS 615 

His last outdoor work of iinpoi taiico was the oxcavation of Elden 
Pueblo, noar Fla^stalT, Ariz., in 1926. 

As chief of the Bureau of Ethnology Doctor Fewkes also found 
time to interest himself in the archeoloiry of the southeastern part of 
our country which he visited several times. His most important 
undertaking here was the excavation of the Weeden Island mound, 
near St. Petei-sburg, Fla., in the winter of 1923-24, and it is charac- 
teristic of his archeological optimism that his very last expedition 
consisted in a " reconnaissance " of the Piedmont region of South 
Carolina in June, 1927, looking toward more extensive investigations 
at some later period. 

In April, 1925, Doctor Fewkes had to undergo a severe operation 
and, while he returned to the field, as noted, in 1926 and 1927, he 
never recovered fully from its effects. After his return from the 
South in 1927 he suffered a fall and, as a result of it, became so much 
weaker that on January 15, 1928, he resigned as chief of the Bureau 
of American Ethnology but continued on its staff until November. 
His death took place on May 31, 1930, his wife, who had been his 
constant field companion, preceding him by a few weeks. 

Doctor Fewkes was a member of the National Academy of Sciences 
and an honorary or corresponding member of many scientific societies, 
American and foreign. He was secretary of the Boston Society of 
Natural History from 1889 to 1891, vice president and chairman of 
section H of the American Association for the Advancement of 
Science in 1901 and again in 1915, president of the Anthropological 
Society of Washington in 1909 and 1910, president of the American 
Anthropological Association in 1911 and 1912, and for more than 30 
years he was on the visiting committee of the Peabody Museum at 
Harvard University. 

In January, 1915, he was the official representative of the Smith- 
sonian Institution at the inauguration of Doctor KleinSmid as presi- 
dent of the University of Arizona and had bestowed upon him by 
that institution the degree of LL. D. On the occasion of his seven- 
tieth birthday, November 14, 1920, a luncheon was given in his honor 
at the Smithsonian building, participated in by about 40 of his 
friends, and a specially bound volume of letters of congratulation 
was presented to him. His last public act was the presentation of a 
bust of Louis Agassiz to the Hall of Fame on behalf of the American 
Association for the Advancement of Science and an unnamed admirer 
of the great naturalist. This took place on May 10, 1928, Doctor 
Fewkes being the only pupil of Agassiz then living able to be present. 

His publications include, besides the two papers on electricity 
already mentioned, nearly 70 contributions to invertebrate zoology, 
mainly the Medusae, Eohinodermata, and Vermes, and about 200 
contributions to ethnology and archeology. 



616 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

Doctor Fewkes was possessed of a genial and confiding nature and 
an effervescent enthusiasm which drew people to him and made them 
readily communicative of any information they happened to have 
regarding new types of ruins, unique pottery, or mounds which had 
escaped scientific eyes, so that, from the quantity point of view, he 
was almost uniformly successful in his field expeditions. And in 
this way he made many openings for later workers, even though he 
did not exploit all the possibilities of an undertaking. For he was 
interested in variety of material, especially material of a novel char- 
acter, rather than in associations of materials, and the extension of 
his work interfered with its intensiveness. However, his unaffected 
pleasure in a new variety of artifact or an exceptional pottery design 
was something that the average man could understand and through 
his talks to tourists and in the lecture hall, and through press inter- 
views, he interested hundreds to whom a more rigorous student might 
have spoken in vain. In this way he created a " Pueblo conscious- 
ness " which drew other investigators to the field and provided 
popular support for their work, performing a similar service to that 
of Gushing at an earlier date on the side of ethnology. Thus the 
title " dean of American archeology " which, with advancing years, 
some of his admirers came to apply to him was not inappropriate. 
It was a term which his charm of manner set off to most excellent 
advantage, and he had a devoted circle of friends who will feel that 
his going has removed something peculiarly warm and winning from 
their lives..

GEORGE PERKINS ^[EKKU.L (1854-1029)' 



By Chaklks Schucuert 



[Willi 1 plaU'l 



Georn^e Perkins Merrill was born May 31, 1854, at Auburn, Me., 
and died there suddenly on the niorninj; of August 15, rJiii). He 
was spending; his vacation at his summer home on the Isle of Springs 
off the coast of Maine. On the afternoon of the 14th he left the 
island to look up a reported find of large beryl crystals at Albany, 
Me. That night he spent with his brother, Horace, at Auburn. 
Starting early the next morning for Albany, he was stricken with 
ajwplexy in the railway station at Auburn Avhile waiting for the 
train. As Miss Moodey writes: 

It seemed quite strange tlmt he should have Kono back to his birthplace nnd 
died there ; it is also there that he is burietl. The funeral services were h»'ld 
on Sunday the 18th in the Minot Church, where his grandfather preached. 

Merrill's father, Lucius Merrill, a carpenter and cabinetmaker, was 
a descendant of Nathaniel Merrill, who settled in Newbury, Mass., in 
1633, and who is stated to have been one of the Huguenot de Merles 
who were driven out of France at the time of the massacre of St. 
Bartholomew, the name ''Merrill " being a corruption. His mother, 
Anne, was the daughter of the Rev. Elijah Jones, of the First Con- 
gregational Church at Minot, Me. There were seven children. He 
writes : 

The home being somewhat crowded, I lived for several summers with my 
grandfather in Minot, and after I had bocoine of sufficient age to be of value, 
worke<l for tliree summers on the neighboring farm of my uncle. I was edu- 
cated in the t<j\vn schools of Aul)urn and the Lewiston Falls Academy, situated 
in Auburn, afterwards icnown as the Edward Little High School. I early 
became quite independent, at first doing small chores for the neighbors, then

working with my father, when at school acting as janitor of the building, and 
in later years, from 18 to 21, working in the shoe factories. My education 
up to the time I was 21 was necessarily scrappy, but in the winter of 1876 
I entered the University of Maine (then the small and struggling Maine State 
College), working my own way as in years previous and graduating in chemis- 
try with the degree of B. S. in 1879. Later I received the honorary degrees 
of M. S. (1883) and Ph. D. (1889) from the same institution. 

During the winter of 1876 I taught school at what is known as the Jackson 
district in Minot Center and during the vacations of the subsequent winters 
at East North Yarmouth, all in the State of Maine, receiving in the first 
Instance $25 a month and board, and in the second, $30 a month and board 
as remuneration. I taught everything asked for — to students ranging from 
those who were sent to keep them from under their mother's feet to those 
who were as old and several sizes larger than I was myself. Along with the 
a, b, c's, I taught English, grammar, French, algebra, and geometry, and it 
was even suggested that I add singing as an extra course! Since I felt that 
a line should be drawn somewhere I drew it there. 

Immediately after graduating in 1879 Merrill became assistant to 
Prof. W. O. Atwater in Wesleyan University at Middletown, Conn., 
working with him on the chemistry of foods. It was while here 
that he made the acquaintance of America's greatest pioneer in mu- 
seum administration, Dr. G. Brown Goode, a graduate of that uni- 
versity and some time curator of its museum collections, but at this 
time in charge of the United States National Museum. They were 
attracted to each other at once and it was this meeting, together 
with an earlier recommendation, that had much to do with Merrill's 
subsequent appointment in the National Museum. In the winter of 
1880-81 Merrill was connected with the Fisheries Bureau at Wash- 
ington, D. C, and in the following July was transferred by Doctor 
Goode to the staff of the geological department of the National 
Museum as aid to Dr. George W. Hawes, who had in 1880 been 
appointed curator of geology. As we shall see, it was the latter who 
started Merrill on his geological career, and mainly in the line of 
petrology. 

In the sketch above referred to, Merrill says that he must have 
been born with a fondness for natural history, but adds : 

If in my work there may have been any one controlling influence it must 
be attributed to the summers of my childhood which I spent with my [maternal] 
grandfather. He was a man of far more scholarly standing than the majority 
of clergymen In like situations. In the parlor of his house, on the mantel over 
the fireplace, I remember there stood a stack of narrow pine shelves on which 
were placed from time to time such objects as were sent to him by missionary 
friends from heathen lands and such " natural curiosities " as came to hand. 
Among these last were found a long-horned, adult form of the pine tree borer, 
Monharmnus confusor, and a hideous lace-winged " helldiver," Corydalis comuta. 
Later I myself added many insect forms, including the big luna-moth which was 
esteemed a great treasure. But amongst the inorganic forms there was a curved 
piece of stone, like a fragment of a saucer, or possibly the segment of a sphere. 
There was nothing remarkable about it had it not been that there rested In 



MERRILL — SCHUCHEET 619 

It a small splierlcal pebble, the two resembling an iron-stoue coucretlou familiar 
to geologists. I long afterwards learned that the two had had no connection 
whatever, someone having placed the i>eblile in the nveittucle. It always excited 
my attention and I never failed to examine it when admitted to the room. 
. . . When the old household was binken up by death and removal, I secured 
that specimen as my share of the spoils, and to-day It rests on another mantel 
over the fireplace of the living room in my home at Washington. 

Further information regarding these early influences appears in a 
letter dated October 20, 1921, wherein Merrill states that it was in 
particular the insect collection belonging to his grandfather that 
excited his enthusiasm (MS., 1924) : 

Wliat more natural than that with these " as an example " I should myself 
begin collecting, and under Judicious encouragement soon had my room at home 
a far more diversified curiosity shop than anything displayed at my grand- 
father's? This indiscriminate collecting I carried through my school and col- 
lege days, and so succeeded in impressing one of my iulluential friends, all 
unintentionally, that years afterward he recommended me to the late G. Brown 
Goode of the Smithsonian Institution as a promising youth for appointment 
on his staff. 

I do not know that I had any very decided views on what profession I 
wished to take when I entered college. I had thought of civil engineering but 
this was mainly because it was an out-of-door pursuit — as I understood it. It 
was not long, however, before I decided on chemistry and natural history as 
more to my taste, and to these I gave most of my attention. Prof. A. B. 
Aubert was then professor of chemistry and as it turned out I became his 
favorite pupil. I failed, however, to become a cliemist, though I became a fair 
analyst. Our professor in natural history was C. II. Fernald. I became, too, 
one of his favorite students and acquired much Information that helped me 
in my subsequent career. What I learned In geology was almost wholly my 
own ; not a single field trip did we get, nor were we taught even the rudiments 
of field work. My first real geological trip was with Prof. W^illiam North Rice, 
with whom I visited the contact between the trap and Triassic sandstone at 
Meriden, Conn., while assistant at Middletown. 

Merrill was married in November, 1883, to Sarah, daughter of 
Joseph R. Farrington of Portland, Me. She fell seriously ill in 1892, 
and the family had to be divided between Maine and Washington, 
These were hard and trying days for the Merrills. Mrs. Merrill 
died in 1894, leaving four children, Joseph Farrington, Anne Mar- 
garet, Mildred Hastings, and Ruth. In February, 1900, Merrill 
married Miss Katherine L. Yancey, of Virginia, by whom he had 
one daughter, Katherine Dorothy. During the years 1909 to 1913 
Merrill himself had setbacks through illness, necessitating repeated 
visits to the hospital, but from this trouble he apparently recovered 
fully. 

Physically, Merrill was 5 feet 10 inches in height, of sturdy build, 
with sandy hair and keen blue eyes. Alert and active, he was always 
occupied, spending mo.st of his evenings reading, not only the sci- 
entific publications of the day, but the best literature as well ; on 
his table invariably lay copies of the poems of Robert Burns, the 



620 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930 

Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, and some volumes of Edwin Arling- 
ton Robinson; in fact, he was ever a lover of music and poetry. 
A typical " down East Yankee," he appeared on first acquaintance 
austere, reserved, and pessimistic, but to his many friends, though 
always critical, he showed a loyal and generous heart. Those who 
met liim as host or at any social function found him unsurpassed 
in humor and in apt quotation. 

Merrill's thought was rarely, if ever, speculative. As Farring- 
ton (1930) says, " He preferred to keep close to facts and allow time 
and accumulation of further data to furnish their interpretation," 
a tendency to which he himself bears witness when he states that he 
prefers in his daily work " to be always afloat in regard to opinions 
in geology." (1913a: 67.)' 

His ideals of what qualities a geologist should possess profes- 
sionally may be read in his statement at the centenary of the birth 
of James D. Dana, whom he greatly admired. "A geologist," he 
says, " must be, first, a good observer ; second, he must be sufficiently 
grounded in certain basal sciences to enable him to draw legitimate 
conclusions from what he observes ; third, he must know what other 
workers have done and be able to utilize to advantage their work and 
conclusions; fourth, he must have staying power; fifth, if he is a 
great geologist he must possess a creative imagination and be mas- 
ter of both inductive and deductive methods of reasoning." 
(1913a: 64-65.) 

Merrill was a Government officer in the United States National 
Museum for nearly a half century (1881-1929). His official and 
scientific career there will be presented under four headings, as 
follows : 

I. As organizer of the department of geology in the National 
Museum. 

II. As pioneer in the study of building stones and the processes 
of rock weathering. 

III. As pioneer in the application of petrology to the study of 
meteorites. 

IV. As pioneer historian of North American physical geology. 

MERRILL AS ORGANIZER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY IN THE UNITED 
STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM 

As previously stated, Merrill began his long and fruitful Wash- 
ington career in the winter of 1880-81 as aide in the United States 
Fisheries Bureau. The following July he was transferred to the 
department of geology in the National Museum, which had started 
in 1880 in charge of Dr. G. W. Hawes, who died in 1882. The next

Bulletin of the Geological Society of America.

year ^Merrill was promoted to be actin<j curator in charge of the 
division of litliolo<z:y and physical f!:c(»lo«ry, working on tlic collec- 
tion of building stones, and starting another one having to do with 
])hysical geology. In the annual report for 18Si, he says that for 
whatever material the department possessed prior to \HS2 it was 
largely indebted to the Centennial P^xposition of 187G held at Phila- 
delphia, the Tenth Census, and tlie various national geological sur- 
veys. It was this material that he was then laboring to |)ut into 
museum order. " The years immediately following the death of 
Hawes were full of hard work and much trial." In 1889 Morrill 
was promoted to full curatorship, and in 185>7 to head curatorsliip in 
tlie newly organized department of geology, embracing the divi- 
sions: (1) Physical and chemical geology, with Morrill as curator; 
(2) mineralogy; and (3) stratigraphic paleontology. This appoint- 
ment came to him Avhile he was in St. Petersburg attending the 
International Geological Congress. 

Tliis reorganization whereby tlie entire groological. mineralogical. and paleon- 
tolopical departments were placed undiT a single arlministratlve head rendered 
po.ssible. for the first time in the history of the museum, systematic and coordi- 
nate Work in all ilivisions and at the same time permitted the writing of a 
consecutive' rei)ort of progress . . . The colUction up to that time had 
grown In a vory irregular and spasmodic manner, the mineral collection being 
particularly poor and the meteorites hardly worthy of mention. By moans of 
money appropriated to the museum for the purpose of taking part in the 
various expositions I had, however, succeeded in making the geological exhibits 
comprise something more than a collection of building stones and ores, by 
seizing the opportunity to build up exhibits along lines in which the museum 
was particularly weak. (MS. 1924.) 

In Merrills time there were 10 of these expositions. 

As is well known, Merrill proved him.sclf one of the most effective 
of museum exhibitors and husbandcrs of geologic materials. Under 
his care the department of geology in the National Museum grew 
from a small and insignificant beginning to one of the great collec- 
tions of the world, and one which po.'^sibly is unexcelled. 

Anyone who has held a curatorship in a large museum knows that 
most of his time goes into the husbanding of the collections in his 
charge, and caring for the daily work. This routine is greatly in- 
creased in a national museinn since the Government feels obliged 
to answer, so far as it can, all questions asked of it by its citizens. 
Hence, as Merrill has .said, " The curators are subject to a continual 
bombardment of letters containing queries covering a wide range of 
natural history topics, which are only too frequently of a trifling 
nature, dealing with matters which are curious but not important, but 
all of which require an answer." (MS. 1924.) On the other hand, 
"the care of the collections and installation of exhibits has always 
been considered the first duty of the departmental force. Research, 



622 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 193 

except in a few instances, has been secondary — to be carried on as 
time from these other duties permits. In addition specialists and 
interested visitors must naturally be shown all possible courtesies. 
Finally, label writing for the exhibition series requires the greatest 
care and a thorough knowledge of the subject described." (MS. 1929.) 
It is therefore only by the most careful husbanding of the curator's 
time that any research work can be accomplished at all, and most 
of it is done out of official hours. How well Merrill made use of his 
time and facilities is attested by his bibliography of nearly 200 
titles, many of which are long papers and books. In addition, he 
wrote 47 annual reports of his department, and was a contributor of 
articles to at least six dictionaries and cyclopedias. Furthermore, 
in the years 1893 to 1916 he held the chair of geology and mineralogy 
in the Columbian (now George Washington) University and lec- 
tured several times each week during the college year to under- 
graduates, finally retiring on account of ill health. This teaching 
he likewise did after official hours. He also was lecturer in the 
Maryland Agricultural College in 1890-91. 

Merrill's first geologic work had to do with the microstructure of 
building stones and their preparation for exhibition in the Museum. 
In 1883 appeared his first report as curator, in the course of which 
he states that he has in his keeping about 12,500 specimens, of which 
3,862 were the just added building stones. These new and old col- 
lections occupied him for the next few years. He soon came to see 
that " the facts in regard to each and every specimen should be so 
placed on record that its identity can never again be lost, however 
often the administrative force of the department may be changed." 
This greatest of museum necessities he learned from the old collec- 
tions then in his charge, which were largely valueless because of the 
loss of labels, or, worse, because labels had never been written. 

In 1889 Merrill feels that his department in the Museum is in good 
condition, " having become fairly established." In the following year 
he is striving to apply the educational views of that born museum 
worker. Doctor Goode, then in charge of the National Museum, by 
making the geological exhibition series " a profusely illustrated text- 
book in which the objects themselves serve as illustrations, and the 
text, reduced to a minimum amount, is furnished by the labels." 
By 1891 his department has " at last emerged into a systematic series 
of collections, designed to show something regarding the earth's 
structure and history and the extent to which its resources are 
utilized by man." His section now had about 35,000 specimens, and 
that of mineralogy about 25,000 more. 

After 1890 the Department of Geology grew especially rapidly 
and in 1897 there were about 60,000 items in its reserve collections. 



MERRILL SCnUCHERT 623 

At this time, even though all of Merrill's oflicinl time was taken up 
with oflicial routine, he was in his liappiest years, saying; in 1901, 
" The department, as a whole, was never in better condition than it 
is to-day." 

The fjreatest administrative task that came to Merrill was the mov- 
ing of the geological collections from the old and very much crowded 
lirick buiKling to the far larger new granite one. A new arrange- 
ment of the exhibition collections had to be thought out, and deci- 
sions made regarding the type and arrangement of ca.ses and their 
internal shelving. For this task Merrill had prepared himself while 
in Europe. He says: 

I made studies of Russian, Enf:;lish, and otlicr European niuseuraa, with 
special reference to cases and methods of insinuation, acquiring Informution 
wliich became well-ulgh Invaluable to me in later years. (MS. 1924.) 

The preparation for this move and the actual moving from the 
old into the new Museum between August, 1909, and June, 1910, was 
indeed a great labor for all concerned with the National Museum. 
Of the many consultations regarding it between the head curators 
(Holmes, Stejneger, and Merrill) he says: 

I l)elieve our decisions In all these matters were the l)est and carried out 
with as great economy of funds as ever occurred under similar conditions 
anywhere. Our decisions for mahogany cases in place of steel were based upon 
architectural considerations, and I still consider the decision a wise one. Our 
exhibition halls certainly compare favorably with those of any natural history 
museum In tlie world. 

The department of geology, starting in 1880 single-handed, had 
in 1929 grown to a staff of 15 paid or honorary curators and asso- 
ciates. In the way of material wealth the various sections then had 
in their reserve and exhibition collections the following number of 
specimens : 

Section of geology 93,044 

Section of mineralogy and petrologj' 132, 279 

225, 323 

Section of stratigraphic paleontology 1,705,000 

Section of vertebrate paleontology 24,497 

2, 015, 420 
Truly a remarkable growth ! 

MERRILL AS PIONEER IN THE STUDY OF BUILDING STONES AND THE PROC- 
ESSES OF ROCK WEATHERING 

Merrill appears to have been the first to make a systematic study 
of stone for building purposes, and in America the first also to study 
in detail the processes involved in rock weathering. " No material," 
he says, " has yet been found so well adapted to the nobler forms of 
architecture as stone.'' At the basis of this work lies the science of 
petrology, which deals with the microstructure and chemical nature 



624 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 30 

of rocks. It was along these lines that Merrill's greatest activity 
lay between 1881 and 1905, and during these years he published 
upwards of 80 papers and books, a total of 40 per cent of his entire 
bibliography. 

The reason for Merrill's entering the field of petrology he tells 
as follows : 

My abrupt shift from chemistry to geology was due purely to a newly-made 
friendship with Doctor Hawes who was at that time one of the leading 
authorities on microscopic petrology, a branch of study then just coming into 
vogue. It was understood at the time of my accepting this position [in the 
National Museum] that, there being no university in America where this 
branch of geology could be studied, I should be assisted in taking it up by 
Doctor Hawes, but unfortunately, owing to his failing health, this part of 
the agreement was never carried out. At the time I became Doctor Hawes's 
assistant he had been appointed a special agent of the Tenth Census, in charge 
of the building-stone industry, his idea being to ascertain not merely the mag- 
nitude of the industry, but as well the petrographic characters of the mate- 
rials. It was in the latter branch of the work that I was engaged. (MS. 
1924.) 

With the death of Hawes this study and the completion of the 
report fell to Merrill and he made good use of his opportunities, as 
the Tenth Census report shows. (1884b.) Before this study was 
completed Merrill further prepared himself in petrology at Johns 
Hopkins University, where the subject had been developed by Prof. 
George H. Williams, 

Merrill's first duty in the Museum was the cutting of thin sections 
of the entire collection of some 4,000 samples of building stones that 
had been brought together from upward of 1,500 quarries in the 
United States, together with manj^ from foreign countries — " the 
most systematic and complete collection of its kind in any museum 
in the world." Each specimen was examined under the micro- 
scope " in order not only to determine what the rock was, but also 
to ascertain if it contained any mineral constituents liable to un- 
favorable change on exposure to the weather." (1885a: 521.) 

As the Government hours were but from 9 a. m. to 4 p. m., I had opportunity 
to study and all encouragement in the way of use of the materials, and with 
Hawes' volume on the petrography of New Hampshire and Zirkel's report on 
the fortieth parallel rocks, together with the first edition of Rosenbusch's 
Mikroskopische Physiographie, I proceeded to equip myself as best I might. 

The final report, by 21 authors, contained an introductory treatise 
by Hawses on micropetrology, followed by Merrill's account of the 
mineral nature and microstructure with illustrations, and was issued 
as a part of volume 10 (1884b: 15-29) of the publications of the 
Tenth Census. 

The 18 artotype reproductions of photographs taken through the microscope 
were the best that had thus far been reproduced. 

This work on building stones naturally led to his first book, The 
Collection of Building and Ornamental Stones in the United States 



MERltILL SCHUCHERT 625 

National Museum. (1889c.) Merrill continued this work alongf the 
same lines on his own initiative, traveling and visiting quarries, 
examining old stone buildings whenever opportunity ottered, and 
collecting data on weathering properties. Then he rewrote the hook 
and iniblished it as Stt»nes for Buililing and Di-coration. (Ib'Jlb.) 
Of all Merrill's writings none had a wider circulation. It treats of 
the geographical distribution of building stones in the United States, 
their minerals, physical and chemical pi'operties, and weathering 
qualities, and gives suggestions on their selection and testing. The 
book passed through three editions (1897b, 1903e) and was, as he 
says, "the tirst systematic work of its kind to ai)pear in America, 
and I believe I may say was the chief instigator of the numerous 
investigations by State surveys along the same lines which were 
undertaken later." It established his reputation as an authority on 
the subject. Until the Bureau of Standards was established, the Gov- 
ernment repeatedly called for Merrill's opinion on the stones to be 
used in its various buildings. The one building in which he took great 
interest was the Lincoln Memorial. The question of the ability of 
the so-called Yule Creek marble quarries in Gunnison County, Colo., 
to furnish material in quantity and in tiie unprecedented sizes needed 
for this memorial was favorably decided by him after a single visit 
to the place. '' I may state, however," he adds, " that the selection 
of a marble for the structure was not mine. For our climate I 
would have preferred a light colored granite." 

With regard to his work on rock weathering, he says : 

It is perhaps l)Ut natural tliat my attention liaving been called to the weath- 
ering of roclis when used for building pui'poses I should have turned uiy 
thoughts next to this particular phase of geology. The field was an inviting 
one and indeed the amount of superfieial decomposed material overlying the 
rocks in the District of Columbia had early attracted my attention, since I 
had come from a glaciated region where like phenomena were almost wholly 
unknown. The results of my studies In tliis line were very favorably received. 
The main results were brougiit together in my treatise Rocks, Rock-weathering, 
and Soils. (ISOTb.) In tlie preparation of this volume, I luid not only collected 
my own materials, nnide my own sections, but also many of the separations and 
chemical analyses, a detail which in the present condition of chemical science 
I should scarcely dare to attempt. 

This book of Merrill's was unique and has been a source from 
which compilers of textbooks on agriculture have drawn their nuite- 
rials for many years. As Dr. Harvey W. "Wiley said : 

Doctor Merrill is the most complete authority on soils. ... He lias given 
much to geology but has given much more to agriculture — how much tlie public 
will never know. 

And in Europe, Farrington tells us, it is for this woik on rocks 
and rock weathering that Merrill is best known. 

Rocks disintegrate, alter, decompose, and dissolve, under all cli- 
mates, but the decomposition is, Merrill says, most apparent under 



626 ANNUAX, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

moist and warm conditions. In rock weathering, " hydration is an 
important factor, the amount of water increasing rapidly as decom- 
position advances. In the earlier stages of degeneration it is doubt- 
less the most important factor. There is, moreover, among the 
siliceous crystalline rocks, in every case a loss in silica, a greater pro- 
portional loss in lime, magnesia, and the alkalies, and a proportional 
increase in the amounts of alumina and sometimes of iron oxides, 
though the apparent gain may, in some cases, be due to the change 
in condition from ferrous to ferric oxide. As a whole, however, 
there is a very decided loss of materials. Among siliceous crystal- 
line rocks, this loss, so far as shown by available analyses and calcu- 
lations, rarely amounts to more than CO per cent of the entire rock 
mass. Among calcareous rocks, on the other hand, it may, in 
extreme cases, amount to even 99 per cent." (1906a : 220.) 

About Washington, Merrill had observed granitic rocks " so disin- 
tegrated at a depth of 80 feet from the present surface as to be read- 
ily removed by pick and shovel." About Atlanta, Ga., " the rocks 
are ' completely rotted ' to a depth of 95 feet, while ' incipient decay ' 
may reach to a depth of 300 feet." (1906a: 271.) 

When F. P. Dewey in 1889 resigned his curatorship of economic 
geology in the National Museum, Merrill was asked to take over 
this work also. The task of overhauling and installing the nonmetal- 
lic economic collections early focussed his attention on these sub- 
stances, resulting not only in a greatly improved exhibition collec- 
tion but as well in a book. Guide to the Study of the Collections in 
the Section of Applied Geology: Nonmetallic Minerals. (1901c.) 
The popular demand for this shortly exceeded the supply and it was 
republished in modified form by John Wiley & Sons as The Non- 
metallic Minerals. The purpose of this book is " to bring together 
the widely scattered notes and references relative to the occurrences 
and uses of sundry minerals of value other than as ores of metals." 
(1910b: iii.) 

MERRHiL AS PIONEER IN THE APPLICATION OF PETROLOGY TO THE STUDY 

OF METEORITES 

No geological problem interested Merrill more than that of meteor- 
ites, and of his entire bibliography of about 200 titles, no fewer than 
80 have to do with these most interesting celestial bodies. The first 
three papers appeared in 1888 and the last one after his death, while 
the 20 years of greatest activity began with 1907. 

Previous to 1897 the meteorites in the National Museum were con- 
sidered as belonging to the mineralogical department, but in that 
year they were transferred to the division of geology and " recog- 



MERRILL — SCHUCHERT 627 

nized as of petronrraphic rather than mineralopjical interest and 
given an entity of their own.'' In 1S80 the Museum had about 10 
falls and finds, among which were the large irons of Tucson and 
Casas Grandes. In 1888 the number had increased to 128 specimens 
due to the active interest of F. W. Chirke, with I'jG aihlitiunal ones 
in the Shepard collection, which was placed on deposit in 1887 
and became the property of the Museum in 1917. Most of the speci- 
mens in both collections were small. In 1902 there were, all told, 
348 falls of which 143 were irons, and in 1916, 412 distinct falls and 
finds. Merrill alone has described 40 new falls. From Canyon 
Diablo the collection had 400 complete individuals weighing 2,200 
pounds; and of the Holbrook, Ariz., find, over 600 complete indi- 
viduals. (MS. 1929.) As Farrington has well said (1930), "In 
this as in all of his undertakings Merrill achieved remarkable suc- 
cess." Certainly he built for the National Museum one of the great 
meteorite collections of the world, probably the sixth one in numbers 
of falls and finds. 

Meteorites, as defined by Merrill, are those " masses of metal and 
mineral matter which come to the earth from space in the form 
of falling bodies and which are commonly considered identical in 
nature with the meteors, or so-called ' shooting stars,' which on 
clear nights may often be seen darting rocket-like across the sky." 
(191Ga: 1.) They are from regions outside our earth. "The most 
satisfactory theory would seem to be that they are fragments of 
comets which have gone to pieces." (1925c: 457.) A meteorite 
" furnishes tangii)Ie testimony of the nature of materials existing 
outside of our solar system, and affords, aside from the spectroscope, 
the only clue to the matter of which celestial bodies are composed." 
Truly they are chips of other worlds (Weltspiine), as the German 
Chladni said in 1794 — " the remains of worlds gone to pieces." 
(1916a: 13.) 

It is estimated that upward of 20,000,000 shooting stars strike 
the earth's atmosphere daily and are burnt into gas and dust, and 
the total weight of meteoric matter annually added to our earth 
has been e>timated at 100,000 tons. Meteors are all small, " perhaps 
scarcely more than a grain in weight." Even iron meteorites up to 
20 pounds may be wholly consumed in their flight through our at- 
mosphere. The surface of the stony meteorites, as they fall on 
earth, consists of a black crust that is rarely more than a few milli- 
meters thick. This crust is formed while the stone is falling through 
the atmosphere, burning at white to blue heat, and is eroded away 
about as fast as it is made. This black crust, according to Merrill, 
is " a more or less perfect glass." In iron meteorites the crust is 
thinnest, being an oxide of iron. (191Ga : 21.) 



628 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

Outside of the earth's atmosphere, meteorites move at high speeds, 
estimated to be around 25 to 50 miles per second. This speed through 
the air enveloping the earth brings about a pressure on the meteorite 
of about 10,000 pounds per square inch, and if the meteor is of friable 
stone it is crushed to fragments. " If the meteorite is of iron it may 
withstand the pressure, but in either case it catches fire and may l)e 
completely consumed. ... It has been calculated that any iron 
meteorite must lose 90 pev cent of its substance by being burned 
away in its passage " to earth. Not over three or four are found 
each year, and the number of all the iron and stony meteorites in the 
museums of the world is less than 1,000 and their total weight not 
over 200 tons. (1925.) 

Meteorites on entering our atmosphere are greatly retarded and 
usually fall on the earth with speeds up to several miles per second. 
Some have been seen to fall so slowly as to rebound on striking ice, 
without either being broken, and others have buried themselves in the 
soil to depths of 5 feet and one went down to 11 feet. The stony 
meteorites range in size up to 660 pounds and the iron ones to 36.5 tons 
(Cape York, west Greenland). Of all the known meteorites about 
one-half have been seen to fall and have then been found (these are 
called " falls ") ; others, discovered without having been seen to fall, 
are labeled " finds." Of the falls only 10 are irons, and accordingly 
most of the metallic ones are finds. Usually a fall consists of a 
single specimen, but among the stones the individuals of a single fall 
number at times thousands and in two cases each fall yielded as many 
as 100,000 stones. 

Constitution of meteorites. — The meteorites of celestial space show 
" so great a uniformity of material yet so individualized that one 
conversant therewith can tell almost at a glance whether celestial 
or terrestrial in origin." (1930: 47.) 

" The elemental matter of meteorites is the same as that of the 
earth." In meteorites there are surely known 10 common and 18 
rarer elements ; 7 other elements have been reported but as yet these 
are not proved. " Though the elemental matter of meteorites may 
be the same as in terrestrial rocks, the form of combination is at times 
radically different and of a nature to indicate that they formed 
under conditions quite unlike those existing on the earth to-day, and 
particularly so with reference to the presence of free oxygen and 
moisture." (1916a: 1, 5.) One of the minerals known in meteorites 
is mernUite, first noted and described by Merrill, and named by 
Wherry in 1917 in honor of its discoverer. Farrington (1930) de- 
fines it as " a calcium sodium phosphate, differing in composition 
from any known terrestrial mineral."

MERRILL SCHUCHERT 629 

"All known meteorites are composed of volcanic materials, and 
none has shown any traces of animal or vegetable life." Many have 
undergone metamorphism. '* They are comparable with more or less 
compacted and altered masses of volcanic asli or tulF." Nor is 
there prei>ent anything in the natnre of a true vein rock, a ter- 
restrial sedimentary or a metamorphic or pumiceous one, " and noth- 
ing in content of silica, alumina, lime or alkalies corresponding to 
the granites." All meteorites " are of a basic nature, related closely 
to the basalts, pyroxeuites, and peridotites among terrestrial forms." 
(1919a :lb4; 1930:39,45.) 

Merrill arranges the meteorites into " three somewhat ill-defined 
groups " as follows : 

Chonflritic meteorites, consistinp essentially of nilioate 
minerals with minor amounts of tlie metallic alloys and 
sulphides. About 00 i)er cent of ull known stony me- 
teorites are choudritic. 

Consisting of an extremely variable network or sponge 
of metal, the Interstices of which are occupied by the 
silicate minerals. 

Consisting essentially of an allny of nickel-iron (5-25 
per cent nickel) with iron phosphides and sulphides. 
Nearly or quite devoid of silicate material. 

Chondrltic meteorites. — For what they teach, the most interest- 
ing meteorites are the stony ones, the aerolites. These chondritic 
meteorites have small spherical and oval grains known as chondrules 
(from the Greek word for grain) and composed of silicate con- 
stituents, " the formation of which alfords one of the most inter- 
esting puzzles in connection with the origin of meteorites." 

Mineralogicall}', the chondrules are composed chiefly of olivine 
or pyroxene. " Some are largely of an undifferentiated glass. 
Feldspars occur but rarely except in the form known as maskelynite. 
In addition are occasional inclosures of metal or metallic sulphides, 
chromite or other minor constituents." (1920d:450.) 

Merrill in 191G thought that the chondrules might be looked on as 
the solidified molten drops of a " fiery rain " or a world-making mist. 
Later, however, after a study of all the thin sections of stony mete- 
orites in the National Museum he changed this view, saying: 

In none of them do I find chondrules developed in the variety and perfec- 
tion of forms existing in those meteorites which are plainly tuffaceous. This 
fact and others . . . have led me to regard the larger part If not 
all chondritic stones as originally tuCfaceous and owing their more or less 
crystalline condition, where such exists, to heat and pre.ssure in a nonoxidizing 
or even reducing atmosphere. (1920d : 4G2-403.) 

Meteor Crater. — Probably the most remarkable phenomenon 
thought to be connected with the falling of meteorites is a crater- 
28095—31 41 



630 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

like circular hole about 4,000 feet in diameter and 600 feet deep, 
known as Meteor Crater, situated 12 miles southeast of Canyon 
Diablo, Coconino County, Ariz. In the summer of 1907 Merrill was 
detailed by Secretary Walcott of the Smithsonian Institution to 
make a study of this so-called Coon Butte or Meteor Crater. Here 
he had the guidance of Mr. D. M. Barringer, a mining engineer who 
had been unsuccessfully exploiting the place in the hope of recover- 
ing the main mass of the meteorite. 

Meteor Crater has a raised rim, which stands from 120 to 160 
feet above a plain made of horizontal strata of Permian age. At 
the surface is the buff-colored arenaceous Kaibab limestone and 
beneath it the very porous, gray, highly siliceous Coconino sand- 
stone, with a thickness greater than 400 feet. Ever since the great 
hole was found, geologists have been asking : Was it made by a blow- 
out from within, or is it due to an external impact of a stellar 
body? 

The rim of the crater, according to Merrill (1908a), is composed 
of loose unconsolidated rock fragments of all sizes, from microscopic 
dust to blocks weighing thousands of tons. Tlie crater walls " are 
composed of the crushed, broken, and bent strata of the limestone 
and sandstone forming the floor of the surrounding plain, and which 
dip away from it in all directions." The dips vary between 10° 
and 80°. " Perhaps the most significant feature of the ejectamenta 
is the occurrence of enormous masses of the sandstone which have 
undergone a partial metamorphism through crushing and heat. . . . 
This material must have come from a depth of at least 300 feet below 
the original surface." There is also a vast amount of a chalky 
white siliceous rock-flour, the shattered grains of the gray sand- 
stone. Outside of the rim " are many low, rounded, moraine-like 
deposits composed of the same material as the rim, but for the 
most part in a comparatively fine state of disaggregation." 

The deepest part of the crater is about 440 feet below the level of 
the plain. Much loose material has been washed into the pit, hence 
the original depth must have been considerably greater. Bore holes 
put down to 1,100 feet reveal, below the floor of the crater, crushed 
rock (as a rule rock-flour) down to 620 feet, and then follows undis- 
turbed bed rock — a gray sandstone that is not metamorphosed. 

The Canyon Diablo iron meteorites found on the rim and the ad- 
jacent plains are "the most interesting and instructive of known 
meteorites," containing small black and white diamonds. At least 
20 tons of these irons are known to have been gathered over several 



MERRILL — SCHUCHERT 631 

square miles of the fjrouiul about the crater; in number they run 
into the thousands and in weight from 1 gram up to 1,013 pounds. 

Merrill concludes from the shape, size, and ejected material of 
Meteor Crater that the evidence points strongly "to an origin by 
impact. It is difficult, if not impossible, to conceive of the smashing 
and mctamorphibm of the sandstone on any other ground. The sand 
grains are crushed in a manner tiiat coukl be brought about only by 
some sudden shock. . . . The fused quartz indicates great heat. . . . 
The slightly disturbed and unchanged condition of the deeper-lying 
sandstones seems to prove the superficial character of the phe- 
nomena." The higher strata dip downward " as though forced out 
of position by some power acting from above." The in fall of mete- 
oritic material "seems worthy of serious consideration." (1908a: 
489^90.) 

The place of vieteantes in the solar system. — Students of mete- 
orites are now all agreed that they are celestial bodies fallen on our 
earth. Farrington is inclined to regard the meteorites as " portions 
of extraterrestrial bodies," in other words, as " fragments of some 
pre-existing body rather than independent celestial bodies." (Me- 
teorites, their Structure, Composition, and Terrestrial Relations, 
1915:211.) 

According to T. C. Chamberlin, the meteorites are all independ- 
ent members of the solar family, originating out of the sun when it 
was interfered with by a far larger intruding star. This approach 
caused mother sun to give birth to her very numerous family of 
planets and their satellites, to the erratic comets, to the meteorites, 
and to the chondrules to which alone Chamberlin restricts the popu- 
lar term " shooting stars." The careful student must clearly keep 
in mind that Chamberlin regards planctesimals and chondrules as 
the world-making stuff born of the sun. The planctesimals " re- 
volve concurrently in a narrow disk and are thereby fitted to collect 
into planets"; while the widely sweeping chondrules are not so re- 
stricted, and gathering into swarms remain discrete and compose the 
heads of the very erratic comets; the other chondrules, revolving 
close about the sun, gather into the meteorites and are from time to 
time more or less completely fused or metamorphosed. (The Two 
Solar Families, 1928.) 

MERRILL AS PIONEER HISTORIAN OF NORTH AMERICAN PHYSICAL GEOLOGY 

It was but natural that, in his position as head curator in the 
United States National Museum, i^Ierrill should have to know some- 
thing of the connections, education, and career of his colleagues and 
his predecessors, and in his administrative work it was often neces- 
sary for him to look uj) the records of the early Government surveys 



632 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

with a view to ascertaining the final disposition of their collections. 
Having this information, he began lecturing to his students at Colum- 
bian (now George Washington) University about these surveys and 
the older generation of geologists. This led him to devote " odd 
moments " in his official life to the study of the rise and progress of 
American geology, with the result that he became the historian of 
our science previous to the present century. He wrote memorials of 
James D. Dana, John W. Powell, Joseph P. Iddings, George F. 
Becker, George W. Hawes, Carl L. Rominger, Edward T. Cox, and 
W. S. Yeates; and brief sketches of 19G American geologists were 
combined to form his Contributions to the History of American 
Geology (1906e), which was the first book of its kind. In addition,, 
he prepared many shorter sketches for the Dictionary of American 
Biography, now in process of publication. 

From the " Contributions " we learn that the pioneers of Amer- 
ican geology " had received little or no preliminary training along 
these special lines, and had access to but few books. The informa- 
tion with which the geologist of to-day begins his career did not 
then exist, and an effort has here been made to show by what years of 
toil each new fact has been unearthed, cleansed of the debris which 
obscured its outlines, and treasured up in such form that it is now 
possible for the student, in a few short years, to encompass the gar- 
nerings of a century. Nor must it be thought that in touching upon 
sundry disputes, quarrels, and petty jealousies it has been done with 
an idea of belittling the individual in any way. Indeed, a truly 
able man is not belittled by his weaknesses. To appreciate his 
strengih we need to know his weakness. These were but men, and 
we, who are weakly human, like to recognize in them human traits — 
like to learn of their errors in judgment and wordy warfares." 
(191-192.) 

In 1924, the Yale University Press brought out this book, very 
largely rewritten, under the title " The First One Hundred Years 
of American Geology." Schuchert in reviewing it said : 

It is a history of tlie growth of geology in America in all of its physical 
aspects. Beginning with 1785, it goes on to the closing years of the past 
century — a review of the gradual development of the science in this country 
through 100 years. ... It is an impressive volume. 

" Early American geology," Merrill says, " was preeminently a 
science of observation and deduction. Information on which to base 
theory and hypothesis was not available — indeed, did not exist. 
With the accumulation of recorded observations it became possible 
to carry conclusions beyond the point of mere observation, and the 
inductive method was evolved. Well toward the close of the pe- 
riod . . . synthetic methods of research were introduced by which the 



MERRILL SCHUCHERT 633 

attempt is being made to discover by actual experiment in the lab- 
oratory the correctness or falsity of deduction or of inductive rea- 
soning." (1924, 2)refaco.) 

Merrill also wrote Contributions to a History of American State 
Geological and Natural History Surveys. (1920a.) 

In the course of his historical research, Merrill accumulated por- 
traits and autograph letters, nut only of most of the American pio- 
neers, but of a great many of the later American geologists as well, 
and this very valuable collection has now been given to the Museum 
in which he labored so long. 

mkurill''s honors 

Morrill was elected into the National Academy of Sciences in 1922, 
thus receiving the greatest honor that can come to a num of science 
in America ; and in that same year he was awarded the J. Lawrence 
Smith gold medal of the academy for his work on meteorites. He 
was a member of the American Philosophical Society, the Academy 
of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, the Washington Academy of 
Sciences, tlie Geological Society of America (vice president 1920), 
ihe Geological Society of "Washington (president 1906-07), and the 
Maryland Academy of Sciences; and a corresponding member of the 
American Institute of Architects and several other organizations. 
His fraternal affiliations were with Phi Ganmia Delta and Phi 
Kappa Phi, and he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma 
Gamma Epsilon. 

Of honorary degrees, he held an M. S. and a Ph. D. from the Uni- 
Tersity of Maine, and a Sc. D. from George Washington University. 

A very great honor, and certainly a most enjoyable one, came to 
Doctor Merrill on the evening of his seventy-fifth birthday, when 
he was given a testimonial dinner by his many friends and colleagues 
from scientific circles. At this love feast many nice things were 
said of him and of his scientific career, and out of the report of the 
dinner in Science (August 2, 1929:122-123) the following is 
gleaned : 

[For nearly h.ilf a c<'iitury Merrill had been connected with the Smithsonian 
Institution.] During this time Doctor Merrill ha.s won admlrnllon and high 
■esteem from his many friends and acquaintanoes in scientific and social sph«>res. 
His career is indicated by his versatility. He Is a teacher, a critic, n public 
sp«^aker, an executive, and a scientist. I>uriii}r his long and active life, 
Doctor Merrill has done much for the advancctiK-nt of sclenc*', amont; his many 
achievements beinjr several works which stand out as monuments, namely. 
Stones for Building and Decoration, Rock-weatherlnj; and Soils. The First One 
Hundred Years of American Geolofry, and his many highly enlightening works 
on meteorites, for which In 192*2 he was awarded the J. Lawrence Smith medal 
by the National Academy of Sciences. 



634 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 

After the dinner there was presented to Merrill a bound volume 
of more than 200 letters of congratulation and esteem, from his 
friends and colleagues of this and foreign countries. Concluding his 
thanks with lines expressive of a hope based upon T. B. Brown's well- 
known poem, Merrill said: 

" I stand upon the summit of my years," 
So may it ever be, 
Not bowed beneath their weight 
With feet firm planted 
And soul undaunted 
I'll stand and contemplate 
What time has wrought 
And tremble not 
For what was, is, or is to be, 
I'll stand upon the summit of my years.
