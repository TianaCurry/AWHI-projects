BY 

Chaklks D. Walcott, 
Act'ivij Assistant Secretary, Smithnoiiian ln><titi(tioii, in rharyc of U. S. \alional ^fll8^ urn. 



I.— GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 

It was my good fortune to be associated with tlie late Dr. (1. Brown 
Goode for many years, botli as a friend and as an Honorary Curator of 
the National Museum, with a laboratory in the Museum building. We 
were thus in (jontinuous social and professional intercourse for a period 
of fourteen years, and during this time 1 became well ac(]uainted with 
the great work that he was doing, and obtained a fairly clear c.tnception 
of the history, present condition, and, to a certain extent, future needs 
of the M useum. Nevertheless, when, after Professor Goode's death, the 
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Dr. S, P, Langiey, recjuested 
me to take temporary charge of the ^luseum, it was only after much 
hesitancy that I concluded to assume the responsibility, my reluctance 
arising (-hietly from the fear that, owing to ofhcial duties previously 
assumed, the comparatively small amount of time that 1 could devote 
to the Museum would uot suttice for the proi)er care and advancement 
of its interests. However, I took charge of the Museum in .lanuary, 
1897, and ray liope that the cooperation and supi)ort of the othcers and 
assistants (;onnected with tiie Museum would be so large and so effi- 
cient as satisfactorily to su[)plement my own labors, has been realized. 

In a conversation had with Dr. Goode a few weeks before his death 
I learned that he wished to make more or less of a reorganization of 
the ^luseum staff' and collections, and had he lived there is no doubt 
that this would have been done at an early day, on lines that he had 
already outlined in various papers. Soon after taking charge 1 made 
a thorough investigation of the personnel and organization of the 
Museum, and made a number of recommendations to the Secretary, 
whi(;]i were approved ami went into ellect July 1. is:t7. The classifica- 
tion iu force prior to that date, printed in the body of this reiiort, had 



4 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897, 

been iu use many years. The new organization, which went into effect 
July 1, 1897, will be found on pages 6 and 7. 

It has been the custom to present in the Annual Report of tlie 
Museum certain general cousiderations. In following this precedent 
reference will be made to the functions and policy of the Museum as 
outlined by Dr. (Toode. 

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 

By act of Congress passed in 1840 the Smithsonian Institution 
became the only lawful place of deposit for '' all objects of art and of 
foreign and curious research, and all ol)jects of natural history, plants, 
and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United 
States." These collections have served as a nucleus for the iSTational 
Museum of the United States. For many years this Museum was sup- 
ported entirely at the expense of the Smithson fund, aud a considerable 
portion of the collections is the property of the Institution through 
gift or purchase. 

The early history of the Museum — in the building up of which Pro- 
fessor Henry, and later Professor Baird, assisted so ably l)y Dr. Goode, 
took such great interest — is already well known to the readers of the 
National Museum rei)orts, the first chapters of which in recent years 
having been devoted to its presentation and discussion. A special 
paper treating of the relations between the Smithsonian Institution 
and the National Museum and the early collections wliich came into its 
possession was prepared by the late Dr. G. Brown (4oode, under the 
title "The Genesis of the National Museum," in 1891.' 

Ill an historical review Dr. Goode pointed out that the iiistory of the 
Museum may be divided into three periods — first, from the fouiulation 
of the Smithsonian Institution to 1857, during which time s[)ecimens 
were collected solely to serve as materials for research; second, from 
1857, when the Institution assumed the custody of the " National 
Cabinet of Curiosities," to 1876, during which interval the Museum 
became a place of deposit for scientific c<dlections which had already 
been studied; and, tliird, from 187G to the present time, in which the 
Museum has undertaken more fully the additional taslc of gathering 
collections and exhibiting them on account of their value from an edu- 
cational standpoint. 

When the present Museum building was first occupied, in 1881, elab- 
orate plans were made for the reorganization of the Museum staff. The 
first of them (Circular 1) is entitled "Plan of organization and regu- 
lations." Of this it may be said, in passing, that the regulations 
embodied therein were so admirably considered and drawn up that no 
radical changes have become necessary since it was issued, although 
occasional minor modifications and additions have been made from 
time to time, to meet the special requirements of varying conditions,

REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 5 

and on account of tbe establisliment of new departments and sections 
in tbe Museum. In tliis pamphlet the functions and policy of the 
Museum are clearly delined, as may be seen from the following ])ara- 
graphs (juoted from its pages: 

The collections in the National Mnsenni are intended to exhibit the natural and 
industrial resources ])riiiiarily of the United States and secondarily of those of the 
remainder of the world, for the j)urpose of comparison. 

The activity of the Museum is exerted in three directions: («) The permanent 
preservation of ohject.s already in its possession ; (h) the ac(|uisition of u<'w material ; 
(c) the utilization of material already in its possession, by its exhibition in the most 
instructive manner and by the prosecution of and ])ublication of scientific researches 
for which it forms the basis; by the distribution of properly labeled duplicates of 
materials to colleges and other educational institutions. 

The preservation of material is accomplished l»y nidans of the vigilance of the 
curators and the skill of the preparators. 

New material is aciinireil (a), in accordance with law, from the various govern- 
ment surveys and expeditious; (b) by gift from individuals, from other institutions, 
and from foreign governments; (c) by exchange for its duplicate specimens or j)ub- 
lications; (d) by the efforts of ofticers of the ^luseuni, who niake collections in C(m- 
nection with their regular duties or are detailed for special service of this nature; 
(e) by purchase, when appropriations are made by Congress for that purjtose. 

The treasures in the custody of the Museum are utilized to the world by exhibiting 
them to the public, and by encouraging investigations on the part of the otlieers of 
the Museum and other suitable jjersons, and facilitating the publication of the 
results; also by the distribution toother museums and educational institutions of 
duplicate specimens, which have formed the basis of scientific investigation, these 
being identified and labeled by the best authorities. 

]>}• these means the Museum fulfills a threefold function: 

1. It is a museum of recfinl. in which are i)ieserved the material foundations of an 
enormous amount of scientific knowledge, the types of numerous past investiga- 
tions. This is especially the case with those materials which have served as a 
foundation for the reports upon the resources of the United States. Types of inves- 
tigations made outside of the Museum are also incorporated. 

2. It is a museum of research, by reason of the policy which aims to make its con- 
tents serve as fully as ])ossible as a stimulus to and a foundation for the studies of 
scientific investigators. 

Research is necessary in order to identify and group the objects in the most philo- 
sophical and instructive relations. Its ofticers are selected for their ability as inves- 
tigators, as well as for their trustworthiness and abilities as custodians, and its 
treasures are open to the use of any honest student. 

8. It is an educational museum of the broadest type, by reason of its policy of 
illustrating by s]>ecimcns of every kind of natural objcict and every manifestation 
of human thought and activity, by displaying descriptive labels adapted to the 
jiopular mind, aiul by its jiolicy of distributing its jmblications and its named s<^rie8 
of duplicates. 

The collections forming the Xational Museum were from the begin- 
ning very diverse in cluiracter, and when tiie new building for tlie 
Museum was ready for occupancy in 1881 it was extremely desirable 
that a very comprehensive classification should be adopted. Such a 
classification was elaborated by Dr. (loode (Circulai- l.''>), in which man 
was the central figure. Natural objects, both animate and inanimate, 



6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

were regarded as liis resources, and each of tbe arts resultiug- from the 
utilization of these resources was assigned its proper i^lace. 

While this great anthropocentric scheme of classilication, with its 
multiplicity of divisions, was of the highest utility in arranging and 
distributing the vast assemblage of objects in the Museum, it was rec- 
ognized at the same time (Circular 1) that the collections could readily 
be administered by the establishment of four principal scientific 
departments — those of anthropology, zoology, botany, and geology. 

Various causes prevented the adoption of tliese departments; minor 
divisions and sections along these lines had multiplied from year to 
year to meet current demands until it became apparent that further 
development had practically reached a limit and that a consolidation 
under a few principal departments was imperative. 

The new plan of organization, which included three departments — 
Anthropology, Biology (or Zoology and Botany combined), and Geology 
(including Paleontology), was formulated and went into effect July 1, 
1897. It is given in detail in the following tabulation. The results of 
its operation will be considered in the report for 1898.

Worl- of the MuHcum. — Tlius tar, refereiice lias been made to the orifrin 
and growth of tlie collections, and to tbe plans atlo[)ted for their proper 
iustallation and exhibition. There are, however, other functions of the 
INIuseuin which have been brought into operation from time to time 
witli a special view to aiding" the scientilic work of students and inves- 
tigators. Thus, during the year covered by this report, nearly 127,(K)() 
geological and biological specimens, selected from the duplicates, were 
distributed to universities, colleges, and in a less degree to normal 
sihools also. The publications of tlie Museum, consisting of the 
Annual l\eport. Proceedings and Bulletins, are distributed as freely as 
the limited editions will permit, to libraries and individuals, both at 
home and abroad. The constantly increasing re^piests for the identili- 
oation of specimens are invariably complied with, except when analyses 
of geological si)ecimens are desired. These the Museum can not make,

as it has no facilities for doing- such work, nor is it considered expedi- 
ent that the curators should expend their time in assaying material 
sent for tlie purpose of furthering purely commercial interests. The 
thousands of letters containing requests for information on almost 
every conceivable topic are all carefully answered. These now number 
from 1L>,000 to 15,000 a year. Not only is much of the time of the 
curators consumed in furnishing data for replies, but where the request 
shows ii Ixrna fide desire for scientific information, publications bearing 
upon the subject are carefully selected and forwarded, free of charge, 
to the applicant. 

Additional remarks on the work of the Museum in public education 
nmy be found on pages 18-20 of the lieport of the National Museum 
for 181)5. 

The library of the Museum, which was established primarily as an 
aid to the curators in their Museum work, is now under excellent con- 
trol and is increasing rapidly. Sectional libraries have been established 
in every department and section, whereby each curator has close at hand 
such books as he may desire to consult in his special field of work. 
The privileges of consulting the books in the main collection are freely 
extended to a limited number of persons who, although not officially 
connected with the Museum, have given satisfactory evidence of their 
desire to avail themselves of the benefits to be derived from access to 
the library. 

Popular courses of lectures have been frequently provided, and, in 
addition, the lecture hall has been placed at the disposal of societies 
desiring to hold their meetings in the Museum, or to give lectures on 
si)e(;ial educational topics. 

To sum up the policy and aims of the Museum, it may be said that 
the leading ideas kept in mind are to aid in the education and eleva- 
tion of the masses, and to promote the advancement of scientific 
research, (1) through the medium of the collections exhibited; (2) by 
aftbrdiug to specialists access to the "reserve" collections; (3) by the 
identification of specimens; (4) through the agency of the library; (5) 
by the donation of specimens to educational institutions; (0) by the 
distribution of its publications; (7) by its lecture courses, and (S) by 
imparting special information through correspondence.

20 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

Mr. Porter D. Haskel, of the U. S. Patent Office, presented a specimen 
of Chrysopsis falcata. 

Dr. Z. T. Daniel, of tbe Indian Office, has continued to favor the 
Museum with ethnological and other objects. 

Mr. J. W. Paschal, of the U. S. Pension Office, transmitted a photo- 
graph of a Cherokee Indian girl. 

Several collections have been received from the Fish Commission 
during the year. The cruises made by the steamer Albatross in the 
vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands, oft' the coast of Lower California, and 
the Galapagos Islands, as well as the explorations of the steamer Fish 
Haicli'^ have resulted in the addition of much valuable natural history 
material to the Museum. The material obtained by different field 
parties connected with the Commisfiion has also been of an interesting 
nature. Important collections of fishes have been made by Prof. C. H. 
Gilbert, Stanford University; Prof. B. W. Evermann, Mr. C. H. Town- 
send, and others. A very interesting collection of bones and ornaments 
was discovered by Sui>erintendent Leary, of the Fish Commission sta- 
tions at San Marcos, Texas, while engaged in excavating for fish-ponds. 

I^umerous and varied collections have been received during the year 
irom the Department of Agriculture. The increase in the botanical 
collections, under the care of Mr. Frederick Y. Coville, has been very 
marked, and the results of his cooperation are gratifying. 

Large quantities of botanical specimens from many sections of the 
country have been transmitted by individuals and special collectors 
connected with the Department of Agriculture. 

Dr. L. O. Howard, entomologist of the Department of Agriculture, 
has continued to act as honorary curator of the Department of Insects 
in the National Museum. Messrs. Ashmead, Linell, and Coquillett 
rendered able assistance in determining the collections of Hymenoptera, 
Coleoptera, and Diptera. Mr. E. A. Schwarz has rendered valuable 
aid in the work of the Department of Insects. 

Through Dr. C. Hart Merriam, chief of the Biological Survey, speci- 
mens of plants and other material have been received. A. small collec- 
tion of fishes, obtained in Mexico by Messrs. Nelson and Goldman, 
have been added to the Museum collections, and other specimens of 
various kinds, obtained by collectors connected with the Biological 
Survey, have also been received. 

Among the most important collections which have been transmitted 
by the Bureau of Ethnology especial mention should be made of the 
collection of ethnological, entomological, and paleontological objects 
obtained by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes in Arizona and New Mexico, while 
engaged in explorations under the auspices of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution. The Hilder collection of antiquities has also been added to 
the Museum collection. It consists of material obtained from mounds 
in Missouri and Illinois. Mrs. M. C. Stevenson has transmitted plants 
and archaeological objects gathered from Arizona, and among the ZuDi

Indians of Kew Mexico. A collection of ardneological specimens made 
by Prof. G. K. Gilbert in Colorado, ceremonial objects used in connec- 
tion Avitli the '-Ghost Dance'' of the Kiowa Indians, and numerous 
other collections of importance and value have also been received. 

EXPLORATIONS. 

Di'. Williain Tj. Abbott has extended his travels into Lower Siani, 
and lias forwarded to the Museum two very large and exceedingly 
interesting collections, consisting of natnral-histor}- specimens and 
ethnological objects. In a comnuinication concerning the ethnological 
objects obtaine<l he gives a grai)liic descri])tion of the foot-gear found 
in that country, a number of examples of which have been added to 
the Museum collection. The material transmitted by Dr. Abbott 
includes many objects new to the collections, and among the natural- 
history material several new species have been di^^covered. 

Dr. J. W. Fewkes, assisted by Dr. Walter Hough made additional 

ethnological collections in Arizona and New Mexico. The material 

already collected is of especial value, for the reason that it forms a 

•connecting link between the modern and ancient culture of the tribes 

of Middle America. 

Dr. David Starr Jordan, president of the Leland Stanford Junior 
, University, transmitted, in behalf of the Fur-Seal Investigation Com- 
mission, a collection of natural-history specimens obtained by the 
Commission in Japan and Bering Seas. Dr. Leonhard Stejneger and 
Mr. ¥. A. Lucas, of the National Museum, were absent dunng the 
greater portion of the first half of the tiscal year on duty connected 
with this Commission, and during that time they collected a consider- 
able quantity of material for the Museum. Dr. Stejneger extended 
bis trip to Japan, Kamchatka, and the Sandwich Islands, making col- 
lections at all these places. Dr. Stejneger and Mr. Lucas again left 
for Alaska on June 5, 1807. having been detailed, by direction of the 
President, for further duty in connection with the Fur-Seal Investiga- 
tion Commissiou. 

Mr. Charles Scliuchert, assistant curator of the Department of 
Paleontology, was, in October, 18!M), authorized to visit Alabama and 
]\Iississippi in search of the remains of Zeuglodon and other fossil ani- 
n)als. Later in the year Mr. Scliuchert ])roceeded to .Marksboro, New 
Jersey, under instructions to in(|uire into the reported linding of masto- 
don reniains at that place. After completing duties assigned to him in 
connection with the installation of the exhibit of the National Museum, 
and, incidentally, of the Geological Survey, at the Tennessee Centen- 
nial Fxi)osition in the spring of 1897, Mr. Scliuchert remained in the 
vicinity of Nashville lor the purpose of making collections for the 
Museum.. 

Dr. D. W. Snyder, Naslnille. Tennessee, who has been engaged in mis- 
sionary work ill Africa, obtained for the Museum a collection of ethuo- 



22 KErOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

logical objects, inoliulinji- a model of a Mukete house. Dr. Snyder also 
obtained a very iutoresting colloetion of beetles from the interior of 
Africa. He proposes to return to that country, and has kindly ottered 
to procure additional material for the Museum. 

In May ^Ir. J. X. Kose, assistant curator of botany, was directed to 
proceed to Mazatlan, on the west coast of ^Mexico, for the purpose of 
gathering material for incorporation in reports on the botany and 
ethno-botany of the region extending from that point east\yard across 
the low tropical country and over the Sierra Madrc to the arid interior 
plateau. His investigations will be conducted in accordance with a 
plan outlined by the honorary curator of botany and approved by the 
Acting Assistant Secretary. It is hoped that the appropriations for 
the coming year will enable the continuance of his detail upon this 
work. The Mexican minister has graciously bespoken for Mr. Kose 
the kind ofhces of the IMexican otticials in facilitating the transporta- 
tion into the Tnited States of any collections which he may obtain, and 
in aiding in other ways in the furtherance of his plans. 

Additional collections of mammals, plants, invertebrates, and other 
material obtained by Dr. E. A. IMearns, U. S. A., in Xew York, Min-. 
nesota, xMaryland, and Virginia have been added to the Museum 
collections. 

Prof. O. F. Cook, of the Xational ]Museum, obtained, during his 
travels in Africa, valuable collections of tiowers, ferns, and other 
botanical specimens, which have been added to the Herbarium. 

Mr. Holla V. Currie w^as detailed to accompany Professor Cook to 
Africa for the purpose of obtaining natural history collections and, 
more particularly, mammals, birds, insects, tishes, mollusks, and marine 
invertebrates. He was instructed to give especial attention, in addi- 
tion, to protective mimicry among insects and to devote his efforts to 
securing objects and photographs illustrating the arts and industries 
of the Liberian natives. Mr. Currie left Washington in October. 1890, 
and was absent about seven months. 

Valuable collections obtained by field parties and agents of the 
U. S. Fish Commission, the U. S. Department of Agriculture, and the 
U. S. Geological Survey have also been received. 

collectors' outfits. 

Collecting outfits have been furnished during the year to the follow- 
ing persons: Prof. B. W. Evermann, of the U. S. Fish Commission, 
for collecting in Idaho; :Mr. C. G. Korebeck, Washington, D. C; Mr. 
H. C. Oberholser, of the Department of Agriculture; Eev. P. H. 
Siirensen, Jakobshavn, Greenland; Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. A., for col- 
lecting in Xew York State; Dr. W. L. Abbott, Bombay, India; Mr. F. 
X. Holzner, San Diego, Cal. ; Lieut. C. A. Clarke, U. S. S. Thetis, San 
Diego, Cal.: Dr. HeWitt Webb, St. Augustine, Florida, and Mr.

IIFA'OIIT OF ACTI\(; ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 2.'J 

Many of tW. nioinlteis of the scieiitilic staff of tlie Museum have 
eu{^n<^('(\ ill lield-woik dmiiij^ the year, and have been supplied with 
suitable outfits. 

DEVKLOPMKNT AND ARUANGEMENT OF THE EXHIBITION SERIES. 

No (hanjjes of speeial importance have been made in the exhibition 
series diirinj; the y(;ai". A portion of the time of tlie curators was 
occnpieil in |)i (-[lariii^' exhibits fur the Tennessee Centennial Ex])osi- 
tion, and the work of constructing" galleries in several of the halls and 
courts necessarily caused considerable disturbance, and effectually 
l)revented any permanent improvements being made in the arrange- 
ment of the collections. 

In the department of mammals a number of antlers of wapiti and 
carib«)n were hung on the walls, but otherwise the exhibition series 
remains practically unchanged. The collections are very much 
crowded and are in need of labels. The taxideimist in the depart- 
ment of birds has been engaged almost constantly during the year in 
cleaning specimens in the exhibition series and in sui)]»lying them with 
new su])i)orts and label-holders. The cases are not dust-proof, and 
constant care is necessary to keep the collection in good condition. 
The specimens are considerably crowded, but otherwise they present 
a better appearance than for some time past. Portions of the series 
have been rearranged; many new specimen labels have been supplied 
in place of species labels, and descriptive labels for families have been 
<iuite generally placed. A few specimens have been remounted, some 
of which were sent to the Tennessee Centennial Exposition. The exhi- 
bition series in the department of fishes remains much the same as 
heret<^)fore ; a few additions have been made during the year. The 
mounted series of mollusks has been enlarged, but is withdrawn tem- 
porarily for exhibition at Nashville. No material change has been 
made in the unmounted portion of the exhibition series. The collec- 
tions on exhibition in the department of comparative anatomy are in 
excellent condition. A great deal of time has necessarily been devoted 
to rearrangement, owing to the disturbance caused by laying a new 
floor in this hall. A small collection of insects is still exhibited at the 
foot of the stairway leading to the offices of the department, no more 
suitable pla(-e being at present available. 

Much time has been devoted to the exhibition series of fossil verte 
brates and fossil jjlants, but these collections arc still in a condition 
far from satisfa(;tory. When the new gallery is tinish(;d, the former 
series will be considerably enlarged. That portion known as the 
"Marsh Collection " needs labeling, and the entire invertebrate exhi- 
bition series should be mounted on tiles. 

The collecticni of gems has been remounted and installed in four 
cases instead of two, as heretofore. A case containing a series of 
specimens illustrating the mineralogy of Sussex County, New Jersey, 



24 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

has been installed, and the entire collection of -minerals has been snp- 
plied with new blocks. ISTo changes of importance have been made 
in the exhibition series of the department of geology. 

The time of the cnrator of ethnology has been so largely occupied 
with other matters that the exhibition series has received l)ut little 
attention during the past few months. The construction of new gal- 
leries has interfered with the work, as in the case of several of the other 
departments. The collections are, however, in as good condition as 
circumstances will permit. A portion of the exhibition series is 
arranged ethnically and the remainder technically. In the American 
series objects belonging to each culture class are placed together. No 
special changes in the exhibit of the department of prehistoric antliro- 
pology have been made. Many new labels have been added, and others 
are in course of preparation. 

The entire section of religious ceremonials of eastern Asia has been 
rearranged. In the Egyptian alcove six casts made from squeezes 
were added, and the colossal torso from iSenjirli was placed in position. 
In the Assyro-Babylonian alcove the monuments from Palestine were 
installed. 

The electrical collections have been classified and arranged, and an 
effort has been made to assemble and place on exhibition the Henry 
relics. A suitable case has been provided for their installation. A 
considerable number of pieces of Professor Henry's experimental appa- 
ratus have been received from the Smithsonian Institution, and the 
apparatus made by him in 1831 for Yale University has been deposited 
in the Museum. The exhibition series in the section of naval archi- 
tecture has been rearranged with a special view to bringing together 
and in proper seciuence models illustrating the same classes of vessels 
and showing their gradual development. In the sections of textiles and 
animal industries tentative exhibits have been prepared and installed. 
In the section of transportation and engineering the exhibition series 
is in fairly good condition, considering the limited space available. No 
changes of importance have been made during the year. The collection 
of materia medica has been carefully examined and in part rearranged. 
The Daguerre monument has been removed from the rotunda and 
placed in the grounds east of the Museum building. 

LABELS. 

During the year more than 200 requisitions were received from the 
various departments of the Museum, an increase of about 25 per cent 
over the preceding year. 

The following work was done at the Government Printing OflQce upon 
requisition by the Museum : Printing 700 copies of specifications for sup- 
plies, 2,000 vouchers, and 300 labels; binding 181 volumes; ruling and 
cutting 25,000 catalogue cards; ruling, printing, and binding 25 record 
books. 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT Si:CRETARY. 25 

There were i)rinte(l on the Museum press 120,727 labels, representing 
2,480 forms; 103,352 blanks, representing 73 forms; 30,500 letter heads, 
representing 7 t'orins; 15,575 envelopes, representing 10 forms, and

Tennessee Centennial Exposition. 

LIBRARY. 

Tlie librarian. Dr. Cyrus Adler, states that tlie increase in tlie library 
has been larger than in any previous year, that more books have been 
withdrawn, and that the work of the library is progressing satisfactorily 
in all its branches. 

The accessions for the year were as follows: Books, 707; pamphlets, 
1,852; parts of periodicals, 13,035; total, 10.194. These ligures include 
the publications retained from the accessions to the library of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, which were as follows: Books, 373; pamphlecs, 
1,303 ; periodicals, 8,11 7. One thousand books belonging to the Smith- 
sonian deposit were bound at the Covernnient bindery, and 178 were 
bound at the expense of the ^luseum appropriation. 

More than 9,000 books were borrowed during the year, of which 4,000 
were assigned to sectional libraries. 

The Smithsonian Institution has, as heretofore, rendered aid in secur- 
ing the loan of books from the Library of Congress needed for reference 
in the Museum. 

There are n<nv twenty-one authorized sectional libraries, as follows: 

Aduiiuistratiou. Materia iiiodica. 

Birds. Meso/oic fossils. 

Botany. Mineralogy. 

Comparative anatomy. Mollnsks. 

Ethnology. Oriental antif|nities. 

Fishes. Paleobotany. 

Geology. Parasites. 

History. Photography. 

Insects. Prehistoric anthropology. 

Mammals. Reptiles. 

Marine invertebrates. 

An examination has been made of all these sectional libraries, and 
with a few exceptions they are in good condition and well cared for. 

A list of the accessions to the library by gift and exchange, during 
the hscal year ending June 30, 1897, is printed in Appendix III. 

CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE YEAR TO SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. 

Many important monographs and papers, based upon Museum 
material, have been ]>ublislied during the year. The titles of these 
papers, together with abstracts of their contents, are printed in full in

It has been found impracticable to issue hereafter ^'advance sheets" 
containing diagnoses of new species of animals, plants, minerals, etc., 
received in the Museum, as has been occasionally done in the past for 
the purpose of securing priority of publication. In order that prompt 
I)ublication may still be secured, arrangements have been made Avliere- 
by, when necessary, authors can publish such descriptions elsewhere, 
with tlie provision that this action first have the ai)proval of the Secre- 
tary of the Smithsonian Institution. 

PUBLICATIONS. 

The Keijort of the Museum for 1894: was published during the year, 
and on June 30 the lleport for 1S95 was practically all in type. The 
manuscript for the administrative portion of the volume for 1S9G is 
nearly ready for the printer. Volume XVIII of the Proceedings was 
issned in bound form, and papers 10G9 to 1071 and 1083 to 1100, con- 
tained in this volume, have been distributed in the form of separates. 
Copies of the other papers belonging to this volume were issued x)rior 
to the commencement of the present fiscal year. Nos. 1101 to 1119, 
mclusive, of Volume XIX have also been published, together with 
advance editions of five papers (Nos. 1120-1129 and 1132 bolonging to

WORK OF STUDENTS AND INVESTIGATORS AT THE MUSEUM. 

Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. A., has continued his studies of the mam- 
mals collected in connection with the survey of the Mexican boundary. 
He has already i)ublishcd several preliminary |)apers in the Proceedings 
of the ^luseum, and later a general treatise on the vertebrate animals 
of that region Avill probably be issued. Mr. C. H. Townsend, of the 
U. S. Fish Commission, studied the series of Bald Eagles; Mr. C. B. 
Cory, Il^'annis, Massacliusetts, examined some West Indian pigeons, 
and Mr. E. W. Nelson, of the Department of Agriculture, made exten- 
sive studies of Mexican birds in connection with the identification of the 
large amount of material colle(!ted by him in Mexico and Guatemala. 
Dr. A. K. Fisher, of the I)ei)artment of Agriculture, examined numerous 
types in connection with his oflicial work, and Messrs. H. C. (Jberholser 
and W. II. Osgood, of the same Department, made use of the Museum 
collections on a niimlx^r of occasions. INIr. William Palmer, chief taxi- 
dermist of the Museum, studied birds from the Pribilof Islands in order 
to ascertain the status of some of the forms. Dr. David S. Jordan 
examined the collection of fish(\s from Bering Sea, comparing the mate- 
rial with recent collections made by the Fur-Seal Investigation Commis- 
sion. Dr. B. W. Evermann made extensive use of the collections in con- 
nection with the ])reparation of Bulletin 47, by Jordan and F>vermann, 
on the "Fishes of North and Middle America." He also made com])ari-

sons with species recently obtained by the Conunission. Dr. Bashford 
Dean, of jS'ew York Citj', examined certain Chini;eroid fishes, and 
Prof. S. E. Meek studied collections from the Pacific slope. Dr. W". C. 
Kendall, of the U. S. Fish Commission, made comparisons with recent 
acquisitions by the Commission. 

Mr. T. Wayland Vaughn, of the U. S. Geological Survey, has had 
the use of the entire collection of Eocene corals in connection with his 
researches in that group, and Prof. Gr. D. Harris, of Cornell Univer- 
sity, utilized material in the Museum in connection with his work on 
the Lower Eocene faunas. The collections of the department of com- 
parative anatomy have been studied at various times by students from 
medical colleges and the city high schools. Mr. Samuel J. Holmes, of 
the University of Chicago, who is i)reparing a list of the crustaceans 
of the west coast of the United States for publication by the California 
Academy of Sciences, spent a short time at the National Museum in 
examining and comparing specimens. Miss Harriet Richardson has 
aided in the identification of the Isopoda, esitecially the Sphieromida?. 
Dr. Albert Hassall, of the Bureau of Animal Industry, Department of 
Agriculture, and Dr. Murray Gait Motter have prosecuted investiga- 
tions upon the material in the section of helminthology. 

The collections of the National Herbarium have been used by a num- 
ber of S])ecialists not connected with the Museum. Dr. N, L. lirittoii, 
of New York City, made three visits to ^Vashington in order to settle 
certain points in connection with i)lants described in one of his works^ 
Prof. F. W. Card, Lincoln, Nebraska, studied the genus Kibes; Prof. 
J. M. Coulter, Chicago, Illinois, spent several days in the study of the 
Umbellifenie, and Miss Clara E. Cummings, Wellesley, Massachusetts, 
examined the cryptogamic collections. Prof. E. L. Greene, of the 
Catholic University of America, made frequent visits to the Herbarium, 
chiefiy for the purpose of studying various types of Composit.e. Many 
specimens of Astragali<s were determined by Mr. Marcus E, Jones, Salt 
Lake City, Utah. Mr. John B. Leiberg, a field agent of the Department 
of Agriculture, devoted several months to the determination of material 
. collected in Oregon and Idaho. The collections were also utilized for 
comparison or for other purposes by Dr. C. F. Millspaugh, Ithaca, New 
York; Mr. W. L. Jepson, Berkeley, California; Prof. C. S. Sargent, 
Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts; and Mr. K. M. Wiegand, Ithaca, New 
York.

NEW MUSEUM BUILDING. 

A bill appropriating the sum of $250,000 for an additional Museum 
building, introduced by Senator Morrill in the first session of the Fifty- 
fourtli Congress, was taken up in regular course on January 23, 1897, 
but was passed over without action. 

TENNESSEE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION. 

The sum of $14,500 was allotted to the Smithsonian Institution and 
National Museum from the amount appropriated by Congress (1130,000) 
for an exhibit of the various Governmental departments at the Tennes- 
see Centennial Exposition, to be held in Nashville from May 1 to Octo- 
ber 31, 1897. The amount allotted to the Museum was afterwards 
slightly increased. Dr. F. W. True was designated representative for 
the Institution and Museum on the Government board of management. 
Mr. W. V. Cox represents Dr. True at Nashville, and has also been 
appointed secretary of the Government board. 

An extended account of the participation of the Institution and 
Museum in *he Exposition will be presented in the next annual report. 

TRANS-MISSISSIPPI AND INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION. 

An appropriation of $200,000 has been made by Congress for a Gov- 
ernment exhibit at the Trans-Mississippi and International Expositicm 
at Omaha, Nebraska. This exposition will open in June, 1898, and 
continue for five months. 

INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION AT PARIS. 

An invitation to participate in the International Exposition to be 
held in Paris in 1900 has been extended to the United States by the 
French Republic, and an appropriation of $25,000 has been made by 
Congress to cover preliminary expenses in securing appropriate space 
for the exhibits from this country. 

NECROLOGY. 

In another part of this Eeport will be found an extended account of 
the life and work of the late Dr. G. Brown Goode, Assistant Secretary 
of the Smithsonian Institution, who died on September 6, 1896. A 
memorial meeting was held in the lecture hall of the Museum on Feb- 
ruary G, 1897, under the auspices of the Joint Commission of Scientific 
Societies and in cooperation with the patriotic and historical societies 
of Washington. 

Mr. W. C. Winlock, honorary curator of the section of physical 
ai)paratus in the National Museum, died at Bay Head, New Jersey, on 
September 20. 



RKPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 35 

Mr. W'inlock was born on March 27, 1859, at Cambridge, Massachu- 
setts, where lie lived nntil his graduation from Harvard University iu 
1880. Shortly afterwards he accepted an appointment as assistant 
astronomer in the U. S. Naval Observatory, and his connection with 
that establishment continued until 1880, when he entered the service 
of the Smithsonian Institution as curator of the lUireau of Interna- 
tional Exchanges. About two years later he was nuide assistant iu 
charge of olhce-in the Institution. 

Mr. Wiulock continued to interest himself in astronomical work, and 
at the time of his death he occupied the chair of astronomy in the 
Corcoran Scientific School and also in the Graduate School of Colum- 
bian University. Scientitic papers written by him have appeared in 
the publications of the Smithsonian Institution, the Naval Observatory, 
the proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and 
in foreign scientific Journals. He devoted much attention to the 
bibliography of astronomy, and also published several papers of a 
popuhir nature. During recent years his administrative duties occu- 
pied a large portion of his time, although he always cherished the hope 
that at a later period he would be able to devote himself more com- 
pletely to his chosen work — a ho^ie that was never realized, 

Mr. Winlock was for many years secretary of the PhiUisophical Soci- 
ety of Washington. He was a fellow of the American Association 
for the xVdvancement of Science and a member of the Astronomische 
Gesellschaft, of Leipsic. He was also a member of the Society of the 
Sons of the American Kevolution, and for a long period was secretary 
of the Cosmos Club, of Washington. 

On February 4, 1897, Maj. Charles Bendire, U. S. A. (retired), died 
at Jacksonville, Florida. 

Major Ijcndire held for a number of years the position of honorary 
curator of the department of birds' eggs in the jSTational IMuseum. He 
was born in Hesse- Darmstadt, Germany, April 27, 1830, his Gerniau 
name being Karl Emil Bender. He came to the United States in 1852, 
and in 18r)4: enlisted in the army under the name of "Charles Bendire." 
After thirty-two years of service he was retired in 1880 on account of 
disability. He took an active part in the Indian wars in the West, and 
in 1890 was brevetted major for gallant services rendered during a fight 
with the Indians at Canon Creek, Montana, in 1877. lie also led a 
number of expeditions in connection with the work of laying out roads, 
surveying routes for telegraph lines, etc. In 18()7 he crossed Death Val- 
ley, California, and exph)red the deserts of the southern i)art of Nevada. 
The large amount of time thus spent iu the field gave him ample 
opportunity for scientitic observation. 

At the request of Professor Baird he assumed charge of the collec- 
tion of birds' eggs in the National IMuseum in 1884, and soon afterwards 
undertook its entire rearrangement, which resulted in jilacing tlie series 
iu excellent condition for study and reference. His own collection of 



36 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

about 8,000 specimens of birds' eggi^, obtained during his army service 
in tbe West, ranks as one of the most important gifts to the Museum. 
Moreover, the intense zeal which he displayed in his chosen field of 
labor inspired others to lend their generous aid in the work of building 
up the department under his charge. He was conspicuous for the 
methodical and careful manner in which all his undertakings were 
carried on, and particularly so in connection with his scientific 
investigations. 

Tbe most important of Major Bendire's published works is entitled 
Life Histories of North American Birds, issued by the U. S. National 
Museum in two quarto volumes. It is a matter of suicere regret and 
a great loss to ornithology that this work could not have been com- 
pleted before his death; but although incomplete, this elaborate 
monograph will remain a lasting monument to his memory. 

Mr. Martin L. Linell, aid in the department of insects, died on May 
3, 1897. 

Mr. Linell was born at Gronby, Sweden, June 24, 1849, and was edu- 
cated at the University of Lund. Early in life he showed great interest 
in biology, and soon after coming to America, in 1879, he resumed his 
studies, confining himself mainly to the study of entomology. He 
became connected with the National Museum in 1889, and, although 
since that time he worked over and arranged a very large part of the 
collection of insects, it was to the order Ooleoptera that his attention 
was especially given, and all of his published papers were upon that 
subject. It is to be regretted that at the time of his death he had only 
just begun the publication of the results of his work of many years. 

Mr, Henry Horan, superintendent of buildings, died on September 
29, 1896. 

Mr. Horan had been connected with the Smithsonian Institution and 
National Museum since 1857, and during this long period of faithful 
service he had the entire confidence of his official superiors and the 
esteem and respect of all who were brought in contact with him. 

Prof Edward D. Cope, of Philadelphia, one of the most eminent of 
American naturalists, and a correspondent and collaborator of the 
National Museum, died on April 12, 1897. 

Professor Cope's researches covered a wide field, and his contribu- 
tions to scientific literature were varied and extensive. His special 
attention was given to the study of ichthyology, herpetology, mam- 
malogy, and pliilosophy, and the results of his studies in these sciences 
are contained in twenty octavo and three large quarto volumes. Among 
his most im])ortant works the following may be mentioned: "The 
Batrachia of North America," published by the National Museum 
(1889) ; " Observations on the Systematic Eelations of Fishes," published 
in the Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement 
of Science (1871); "On the Classification of the Extinct Fishes of the 
Lower Types," published in the same journal (1887) ; "The Relations of 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 37 

the Horizons of Extinct N'ertebrata of Europe and North America" 
(1870); '-'The Origin of the Fittest" (1887), and "The Primary Factors 
of Organic I^vohition." 

A complete bibliography of his writings is in preparation under the 
auspices of the National Museum, and an elaborate monograph of the 
Ilei)tilia of NTorth America, which he had completed shortly before his 
death, will be published by the Museum. 

Professor Cope was president of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science, editor of the American Naturalist, and a 
member of the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania. 



in. -REVIEW OF WORK IN THE SCIENTIFIC 
DEPARTMENTS. 

DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS. 

Since the death, in September, 189G, of Dr. G. Brown Goode, the 
assistant secretary, the time of Dr. F. W. True, curator of mammals, 
has been occupied almost exclusively with the administrative work of 
the Museum. Dr. True states that the department has been without 
a regular force at times, and throughout the year there has been no 
officer on duty higher than an "aid." Under these circumstances it 
has been possible to do very little more than preserve the collections 
intact and j)revent the routine work from accumulating. 

The exhibition series has remained practically unchanged during the 
year. A number of antlers have, however, been hung on the walls. 
The specimens in the cases are very much crowded, and little could be 
done to improve the general appearance, while it has seemed undesir- 
able to increase the series by adding freshly mounted specimens. The 
collection is still much in need of labeling. This is especially true of 
the foreign mammals, of which there are but few specimens for com- 
parison in the study series. The American series needs relabeling, on 
account of the recent extensive changes in nomenclature, but the cura- 
tor has not found time for this work during the year. 

The study series is in fair order, but could be rendered more accessi- 
ble if additional cases and more space in which to arrange them, could 
be provided. At present it is impossible to carry anything like a 
natural sequence from case to case. 

More storage cases are needed for the larger mammals, many speci- 
mens of which are now exj)osed to dust. 

The arrangement of the collection of medium-sized skulls has pro- 
gressed, but has not yet been finished. 

Considerable work has been done on the alcoholic collection, and the 
smaller siDecies are in fair order. There are still many jars of the larger 
forms (rabbits, weasels, and the like) which need overhauling. It will 
be necessary to reconstruct the storage shelves on which these speci- 
mens are placed, before the latter can be properly arranged. 

The accessions for the fiscal year just closed do not compare favora- 
bly with those of previous years, either in number or value. No new 
sources of supply have developed, and for the reasons above set forth 
the curator has been unable to give special attention to the matter of

iiicreasino- tlio collections. As stated in previous reports, it is espe- 
cially necessary tliat more money be provided for the purchase of speci- 
mens for the department of mammals. 

The accessions of greatest importance are as follows: 

An excellent general collection from lower Slam, consisting of 105 
specimens, was presented by Dr. W. L. Abbott, to whom the Museum 
is already so much indebted for valuable material. Two skins of the 
Mount St. Elias bear were obtained by purchase. Dr. E. A. Mearns, 
U. S. A., presented valuable collections from the Catskill Mountains 
and from the vicinity of the District of Columbia, amounting in all to 
385 specimens. There was also obtained by purchase an excellent 
series of skins and skeletons of lemurs and other jNfadagascan mammals. 
Two specimens of the recently described pigmy African tlying squir- 
rels, genus IfUnrus, were obtained from Mr. A\'illiam B. Filer. They 
are from Efulen, Cameroons district, and appear to represent a new 
species. A number of skins of the larger lemurs, not previously repre- 
sented in the collection, were purchased, and in the same manner three 
skeletons and a skull of Glohiocephala hrachyptera were obtained. 

Mr. William ralmer and Mr. D. W. Prentiss, jr., both of the National 
Museum, colle(;ted ai number of mammals in tlie District of Columbia 
and vicinity, and in the Dismal Swamp, Virginia. Nine fur seals were 
collected by Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, and Mr. F. A. Lucas obtained 
twelve skulls of the same animal on the Pribilof Islands. Six other 
members of the Museum staff have also sent in from one to four speci- 
mens each. 

The Kent Scientific Institute, Grand Rapids, Michigan, through Mr. 
C. A. Whittemore, curator, lent for study a young specimen of a very 
rare Bassaruyon from Honduras. 

During the early part of 1897 the preparation of an exhibit of mam- 
mals for the Tennessee Centennial Exposition was begun. This exhibit, 
as linally installed, consisted of a group of Proboscis monkeys, a group 
of gibbons, and a number of mounted specimens of lemurs, exhibited 
in two unit cases. 

A monograph or revision of the American moles was published by the 
curator during the year. The manuscript of a paper on the antlers of 
the American deer has been nearly completed, but the work has neces- 
sarily been suspended for the present. The i)roper nomenclature of 
the whalebone whales has occupied the curator's attention during such 
time as he could devote to the subject. 

Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. A., has continued his studies of the mammals 
collected during the survey of the INIexican boundary, and has pub- 
lished the results in several preliminary papers in the Proceedings. 
The titles of these papers are given in the Bibliography (Appendix IV). 
A general treatise on tlie vertebrate animals of the Mexican boundary, 
by Dr. ^learns, will ])robably be published in the Ibrm of a bulletin. 
Valuable assistance on technical matters has been rendered by Dr.

Mearns at such times as the curator could not give personal attention 
to details. 

Mr. D. W. Prentiss, jr., Las rendered volunteer service while not 
on the staff of the Museum. 

During the year 1,011 specimens were received, the total number in 
the collection now beiug 16,223. In the catalogue of the regular series 
1,011 entries have been made, and in the catalogue reserved for the 
deposit of the Department of Agriculture there were 10,068 entries dur- 
ing the year. 

DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS. 

Mr. Robert Ridgway, curator of the department of birds, states that 
there were 118 permanent accessions during the year, being 32 more 
than during the preceding year. In addition there were 87 "tempo- 
rary" accessions, consisting of material received for examination and 
report. It is especially gratifying to note that several of the accessions 
contain material new to the collections, and of great value. One collec- 
tion included 55 species and 3 genera new to the Museum series. The 
material received from Dr. W. L. Abbott embraced several specimens 
of s[)ecies hardly represented in the collection. 

The following accessions are worthy of si)eclal notice:

specimens of /'inico/« from California (gift); Mr. Joseph (Jrinuell, Pasadena, Cali- 
fornia, 7 specimens of Californian birds (gift). 

The Museum is indebted to the followiug' individuals and institutions 
for material transmitted at the request of the curator for examination: 
Mr. Osbert Salvin, London, England; Mr. William Brewster, Cam- 
bridge, Massachusetts; the American Museum of Natural Ilistory, 
New York (^ity; the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and 
the Boston Society of Natural History. 

Considerable attention has been given to the exhibition series, and 
it is now in much better condition than for several years past, although 
a general rearrangement would greatly improve its appearance. 

The following extract from the report of the curator indicates the 
present condition of the study series and the progress made in caring 
for the collections: 

The condition of the study series is very satisfactory, except that ])ortion con- 
tained in the storage bases in the west basement, which remains ])racticablj" inac- 
cessible. A large portion of the collection contained in the bird gallery was 
radically rearranged, the classification followed being that of Dr. Stejneger. The 
contents of .52 quarter-unit cases were involved, and in order to give the specimens 
ample room and allow for moderate growth of the collections, 19 additional cases 
were required. The new arrangement is a systematic one, the previous one being 
geographical. The collection is divided into a North American, Neotroi)ical, and 
Old World series. The bird gallery has now become so crowded that further case- 
room can not be had there; eleven of the cases are placed in dotilde tiers. A half- 
unit "type"' case with (£narter-unit compartments was installed in the gallery, and 
the majority of types of small birds were removed from the general collection during 
the ])rocess of rearrangement and placed in this case. A large portion of the collec- 
tion (over 5,000 specimens) made lij- Dr. E. A. Mearus was distributed in the general 
series at the same time. 

About 3.5 cases in the bird gallery were labeled. 

An additional room was placed at the disposal of the curator during the year, tg 
be used both as an office and storeroom. Fourteen (juarter-unit cases were placed 
in it, and the collections of pigeons, cuckoos, and part of the Coroida- were thus 
provided for. Twelve new half unit cases were installed in the west basement, and 
many large birds contained in the old Salvin cases were transferred to them tempo- 
rarily, but the whole west basement collection will re<iuire readjustment when the 
remainder of the new cases are ready for use. 

Since the death, in February, 1897, of MaJ. (Charles Uendire. honor- 
ary curator of the dei)artment of birds' eggs, the routine work of that 
office has been conducted by the curator and assistant curator of the 
department of birds. 

A group of about -50 parrots and birds of British Guiana was pre- 
pared for the Tennessee Centennial Exposition at Nashville. 

There have been no explorations directly under the auspices of the 
Museum through which material has been added to the collections of 



42 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

tliis department. Mauy of the specimens referred to above, in the list 
of important accessions, were, however, collected by the individuals or 
institutions transmitting them. 

A large quantity of material has been lent for study during the 
year, and a number of specialists have prosecuted investigations in the 
department, as will be seen by a reference to the chapters entitled 
"INIaterial lent for investigation" and "The work of students and 
investigators at the Museum." 

The Museum is indebted to Mr. H. 0. Oberholser, of the Department 
of Agriculture, for the identification of certain specimens of owls, and 
for the arrangement of a small portion of the study series, and also to 
Dr. A. K. Fisher for special services. 

The time of Mr. Ridgway has been devoted very largely to the 
preparation of his proposed work on the Birds of North and Middle 
America. Eegarding the progress made he says: 

Since June 30, 1896, there have been completed the synonymy, family diagnoses, 
and concomitant matter — except (in most cases) specific diagnoses, statement of 
geographic range, etc. — pertaining to 31 families, 261 genera, and 1,093 species, 
belonging to the proper field of the work, besides numerons extralimital genera and 
species brought into the analytical "keys'' to facilitate identification. 

With the e2:ception of a part of the Fringillidaj the synonymy is now complete 
(except for final revision) for the entire avifauna of the geographical area bounded 
on the south by the Panama Railroad, together with the West Indies and the Gala- 
pagos Archipelago, embracing altogether about 3,000 species, nearly 750 genera, and 
100 families. The portion of the work completed constitutes in some respects the 
most laborious part of the undertaking, having involved the collation and verifica- 
tion of many thousands of references. 

The assistant curator, Mr. C. W. Richmond, was engaged at intervals 
from July 1 to September 1, 1896, in the determination of Dr. W. L. 
Abbott's collection from East Africa. This work is still unfinished, 
however, owing to the great amount of routine and miscellaneous work 
which has since occupied Mr. Richmond's time. The work of prepar- 
ing a card (catalogue of the described species of birds, with reference 
to the original descriptions, tyjie localities, etc., has been continued. 
' Twenty-nine papers based directly or indirectly ui^on material 
belonging to the department have been published during the year. 
These papers are mentioned by title in the Bibliography (Appendix 
IV). They contain descriptions of a large number of new sj^ecies and 
two new genera. 

The plans of the curator for the further development of the depart- 
ment remain substantially the same as indicated In previous reports, 
and Mr. Ridgway states that the pressure of other work is so great 
that no decided advancement can be made along the lines indicated 
until an additional skilled assistant be employed. 

The number of specimens received during the year was 4,94:7, involv- 
ing the same number of catalogue entries. The total number of sijeci- 
mens in the collection is estimated at about 104:,000.

DEPARTMENT OF lilRDS' EGGS. 

Maj. Charles Beiulirc, honorary curator of this department, died on 
February 4, 1S97. An account of his life and of liis valuable services 
to the National Museum will be ibund under the head of "Necrology." 

At the close of the fiscal year no one had been appointed to the posi- 
tion of curator. Tlie routine work of the ottice has, however, been 
conducted in the department of birds. 

The most important accessions of the year are as follows: 

From J)r. W. L. Ralph, Utica, New York, GIO eggs and 51 nests were 
received. These were all from North America, and included many 
rarities, such as the eggs of the White-throated Swift (new to science), 
the Western Evening Grosbeak (new to science), the Buff-breasted 
Flycatcher, Grace's and Hermit Warblers, the Everglade Kite, etc. 

Mr. Otto W^idman, Old Orchard, Missouri, presented the nest and 3 
eggs of Bacliman's Warbler (new to science). 

Forty-eight eggs and several nests from Lower Siam were presented 
by Dr. W. L. Abbott. 

From Dr. J. C. Merrill, Surgeon-General's OflQce, Washington, Dis- 
trict of Columbia, were received 49 eggs from Fort Sherman, Idaho. 

Forty-three eggs, collected in Texas, were presented by Mr, H. P. 
Att water, of San Antonio. 

Twelve eggs of rare l*etrels were received from Mr. A. W. Anthony, 
San Diego, California. Three of these were donated and the remain- 
der purchased. 

Special Bulletin No. 3 of the U. S. National Museum, constituting 
Volume II of Major Bendire's Life Histories of North American Birds, 
was published early in the fiscal year. This volume contains 518 pages 
and 7 colored plates. The titles of three other papers, based wholly or 
in part on material in this department, are given in the Bibliography 
(Ai)pendix IV). 

The number of eggs received during the year was 838, and of nests, 
102. There were 300 entries made in the catalogue. 

DEPARTMENT OF REPTILES. AND BATRACHIANS. 

The curator of this department. Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, was absent 
during the first half of the fiscal year on duty connected with the 
investigation of the fur-seal rookeries, and after his return to Washing- 
ton he was engaged for some time in the preparation of a report upon 
the results of his observations. In May he was detailed by the Presi- 
dent of the United States for similar duty during the summer of 1897. 
For these reasons the work of the departnumt of reptiles and batra(;hians 
has been greatly interfered with. There has, however, been an increase 
of 50 per cent in the number of permanent accessions, the total for the 
year having been (id. The most important additions are as follows: 

A collection of reptiles and batrachians from Liberia, obtained by 



44 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

Prof. O. F. Cook, of the U. S. National Museum; a number of reptiles, 
chiefly from Australia, received in exchange from the Australian 
Museum, Sydney, New South Wales; two lots of material collected by 
Dr. W. L. Abbott in Lower Siam ; a collection of reptiles and batra- 
chians from Madagascar, obtained by purchase; a series from Yesso 
Island, Japan, presented by S. Nozawa, Sapporo, Japan; a number of 
lizards from Hawaii, trans* itted by Mr. H. W. Henshaw, and a col- 
lection of the same character from Mr. Yaldemar Knudsen. Doctor 
Stejneger collected reptiles and batrachians in Jaj)an and the Hawaiian 
Islands, and material from Japan was also received from the Science 
College Museum, Tokio. 

Mr. William Palmer, Mr. D. W. Prentiss, jr., and Mr. Paul Bartsch 
collected material in the Dismal Swamp, Virginia. 

The collections were examined systematically on two occasions, and 
the alcohol replenished and strengthened as required. 

A paper by Doctor Stejneger on a new species of Guillemot from the 
Kurile Islands was published in the Auk of April, 1897. 

The number of specimens received and entered during the year was 
1,158, the total number now in the collection being placed at 36,777. 

DEPARTMENT OF FISHES. 

Dr. Tarleton H. Bean continues to act as honorary curator of this 
department, although Mr. Barton A. Bean, the assistant curator, has 
practically had charge of the department during the year. 

During the year there were 30 accessions to the collection, four of 
which were " temporary." The total number of accessions last year 
was 22. So far as scientific value is concerned, the material received 
compares favorably with that acquired during the preceding year. A 
series of fishes obtained by the steamer Albatross in tlie vicinity of the 
Hawaiian Islands, off the coast of Lower California, and in the vicinity 
of the Galapagos Islands, was received from the U. S. Fish Commis- 
sion. The commission also transmitted a collection of types and 
cotypes of 41 species of fislies from the west coast of North America, 
and a series of specimens from the Colorado and Columbia rivers, 
including several types. Prof. Seth E. Meek, of the Field Columbian 
Museum, presented a fine series of fishes collected by himself in the 
Bay of Naples. Material was received in exchange from the Austra- 
lian Museum, Sydney, New South Wales, and from the Museum of Nat- 
ural History, I^yous, France. A series of fishes from the vicinity of 
Yesso Island was presented by Mr. S. Nozawa, by whom they were col- 
lected. An interesting collection obtained in 1892 and 1894 in Mexico 
by Messrs. Nelson and Goldman, of the U. S. Department of Agricul- 
ture, was turned over to the Museum. Prof. O. F. Cook collected a few 
fishes during his recent trip to Liberia. 

The study series has been increased during the year by the addition 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 45 

of numerous type specimens and other desiderata. A lar^e portion of 
the series stored in the west basement lias been relabeled and con- 
densed, with a view to making" it more accessible. Tlu^ collections on 
exhibition are referred to in the chapter entitled " Development and 
arrangement of the exhibition series." 

All of the specimens received during the year have been entered on 
the catalogue books, and most of them are labeled and installed. The 
entire collection has been examined from time to time, to insure the 
preservation of the spet;imeus. In February and March, 1897, an 
exhibit consisting of deep-sea forms and a series of casts of American 
fishes was prepared for the Tennessee Centennial and International 
Exposition at Kashville. 

Small sets of American fishes were distributed to the following 
foreign institutions: Museo Civico di Storia Xaturale, (^enoa, Italy; 
Zoologisches Institut, Kiel, Germany; The Australian Museum, Syd- 
ney, New South Wales; The Natural History Museum, Academy of 
Sciences, Stockholm, Sweden. 

The preparation of a report upon the fishes collected by the U. S. 
Fish Commission stQumer Albatross in South American Avaters in 1SS7-88 
has been continued by the honorary curator. A report has been pre- 
pared by the assistant curator upon several new fishes from Bering Sea, 
and the manuscript and drawings are now ready for the printer. The 
fishes collected by Messrs. Nelson and Goldman in Mexico have also 
been reported upon by Mr. Barton A. Beau. 

Material has been sent to a number of persons for study, and several 
specialists have prosecuted investigations in the depai'tment. A refer- 
ence to these transactions will be found in another i)lace. 

Dr. Theodore Gill, associate in zoology, has, as usual, rendered valu- 
able assistance during the year. Drs. David S. Jordan, C. H. Gilbert, 
S. E. Meek, and W. C. Kendall have aided in the examination of doubtful 
species. 

Two ichthyological works of special importance have been published 
during the year — Special Bulletin No. 2 of the Museum, entitled Oceanic 
Ichthyology, by the late Dr. G. Brown Goode and Dr. Tarletou H. Bean, 
and part 1 of Bulletin No. 47, entitled The Fishes of North and Middle 
America, by ^Messrs. Jordan and Evermann. Thirteen other i)apers 
based ny>on INIuseum material have been published, the titles of which 
will be found in the Bibliograjdiy (Appendix IV.) 

New cases will be constructed for that portion of the collection which 
was removed from the room above the ofiice of the department. Elec- 
tric lights have recently been furnished in the basement. 

A portion of the study series has been stored in the exhibition hall 
for some time past, this condition of things being necessary on account 
of lack of space. Additional cases should be erected in the basement 
for the accommodation of these s])e(:imens, the exhibition space thus 
provided being used for the installation of a collection which will be of 
popular interest. 



46 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

In order to provide additioual material to take the place of the alco- 
holic specimens, which will inevitably deteriorate, it will be necessary 
to collect, from time to time, the fishes of our coasts, even the common 
forms. 

There were 2,110 specimens received during the year, tlie total num- 
ber of specimens in the collection being estimated at 150,000. These 
figures are the same as those given in the last report, since the material 
distributed, in connection with a small amount of useless duplicate 
material which has been discarded, is about equal to the receipts for 
the year. The last catalogue entry on June 30, 189G, was 47687, and on 
June 30, 1897, 48471. 

DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS. 

Dr. William H. Dall, honorary curator, states that there were 149 
accessions to the collection of mollusks during the year, as compared 
with 118 for the preceding year. It is estimated that these accessions 
embrace more than 10,000 specimens, which is three times the number 
included in the accessions for 189r)-96. While many of the accessions 
were not large or important, on the whole an unusual number of desir- 
able species were received and, as a result, many gaps in the reserve 
series have been filled. 

The curator calls special attention to the following contributions: 

The most important accessions are those due to the generosity of Rev. L. T. Cham- 
berlain, of New York City, who, as in past years, has contributed by the purchase 
of <lesirab]e material, especially UnionidiP. Much-needed publications bearing on 
the same subject have also been secured. The most important single lot of speci- 
mens comprised 232 sjiecies and over 700 specimens from the well-known Salle col- 
lection, recently sold in Paris. 

Next in importance is a series of 200 species and 315 specimens purchased to com- 
plete the series exhibited at Nashville. All of these will be added to the reserve 
series and will supply many deticiencies. 

Thirdly, there should be mentioned a quantity of material received from the U. S. 
Fish Commissiou, comprising about 5,700 specimens. Among these are many desir- 
able additions to our collections of North Pacific mollusks. 

A collection containing about 400 species, largely from the Island of Cuba and 
adjacent regions, was purchased, adding a number of desiderata to the Museum 
series. 

Among the smaller lots which are worthy of special mention are the following: 

From Dr. W. L. Abbott was received a small but interesting series of shells from 
the Malay Peninsula. All of the material was new to the collection, and it included 
a number of fine specimens, among them a new species of Nanhm. 

Mr. J. S. Arnheim, of San Francisco, presented 50 or 60 miscellaneous species, most 
of which were desiderata. 

Rev. E. H. Ashmun, Albuquerque, New Mexico, presented several small lots of 
interesting land shells from New Mexico and Arizona. These included a few new 
species. 

From the Australian Museum, Sydney, New South Wales, 29 species of most 
desirable Australian land shells were received in exchange. 

Mrs. T. S. Oldroyd, Los Angeles, California, has continued her researches into the 
fauna of San Pedro and has presented a number of species not before represented 
in the collection from that locality. Some of these were undescribed. 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 47 

Dr. W. II. Eiisb, IT. S. N., sent iii oxchauge a number of typical S])ecimeu8 of inter- 
esting shells from the Parana River and adjacent parts of South America. 

The U. S. Department of Agriculture presented a number of interesting jNIexican 
species collected by Mr. K. W. Nelson. Several of these were now and most of the 
others were not previously represented in the Museum series. 

Dr. DeWitt Woltb, St. Augustine, Florida, presented negatives of photographs of 
a sea monster stranded near that place, named Octopua g'ujantcits by Professor Verrill. 
Portions of the remnins, preserved in formalin, were also transmitted. 

Col. L. Worthington Wilmer gave a miscellaneous lot of shells from various 
localities, some ()f wliicli were very acceptable. 

Mr. Berlin H. Wright, Penn Yan, New York, contributed a large number of inter- 
esting Naiades, all of which filled gaps in the geographical series and several of 
which were author's cotypes of new sjiocies. 

In the chapter entitled " Development and arrangement of the exhi- 
bition series" will be found a statement relating to the exhibition 
series in this department. A series of mounted specimens, illustrating 
the families of mollusks, was sent to Nashville for exhibition at the 
Tennessee Centennial Exposition. The study or reserve series has 
been considerably increased during the year, and the whole collection 
is in condition for reference by means of a card catalogue of the genera. 
The material received from Professor Yerrill is now all labeled and 
listed, but it will not be incorporated with the regular study series until 
the remainder of the specimens have been received from him. The 
work of registering the Jeffreys collection has progressed, althongh 
slowly, on account of the extreme care which it is necessary to exercise 
in handling the material. The reserve collection of alcoholics, except 
the most recent accessions, is now catalogued on cards, more than 
2,000 of the latter having been filled out dnring the year. The collec- 
tion of duplicates is also fully catalogued and in perfect order. The 
number of species represented is 4,174. The collection of minute 
Helicida^ — Pupa, Vertigo, ri.si<(iuin, etc. — has been worked over and 
named by Dr. V. Sterki, and may now be regarded as in complete 
order for reference. 

The honorary curator makes the following statement regarding the 
scientific work accomplished by members of the staff and by others not 
connected with the department: 

The report on the land shells collected by the Mexican Boundary Commission has 
been printed. The discussion of tlie insular land fauuic illustrated by the collec- 
tions at the Galapagos Islands, by Dr. (J. liaur and others, is likewist; printed. 

The descriptions of the Autilleau Tertiary fos.^ils prepared by the curator from 
the collections of the National Museum, including a revision of the mannscriiit sub- 
mitted by Mr. R. J. L. Guppy, of Trinidad, West Indies, have also been published. 

Work has been continued by Mr. Chas. T. Simpson on his proposed monograph of the 
Naiades, and fair progress has been made. The curator has continued to devote con- 
siderable time to the Neocene fauna of Florida. The Pelecypods, up to and includ- 
ing the PeetinidiB, are practically finished. This work involved complete revision of 
the reserve series belonging to the Museum, as far as the work has gone. 

-Mr. II. A. Pilsltry, of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, has been 
studying the collection of Scaplio)>ods, which is one of the largest in the world, in 
connection with liis monograph of that grouj), now in prei)a ration, lie has also 
luilized the collection of the genus JiiiUinns for the same purpose. 



48 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

Dr. E. L. Mark, of Harvard University, has studied the collection of microscopic 
slides illustrating the anatomy of the rare forms of Pelecypoda, and Mr. Berlin II. 
Wright has utilized the collection of Naiades in connection with his studies of that 
group. 

Mr. T. Waylaud ^'aughan lias had the use of the entire collection of Eocene corals 
in connection with his researches. 

Prof. G. D. Harris, of Cornell University, utilized the collection in connection 
with liis work on the lower Eocene fauna^. 

A number of minor investigations of particular groups or species have been made 
by members of the staff, and also by visitors. 

Miss Jennie A. Letson, of Buffalo, a student of the Academy of 
Natural Sciences of Pliiladelphia, devoted several weeks to a general 
study of the Mollusca. In return for the privileges afforded she ren- 
dered considerable assistance during a portion of the time in the 
regular work of the department. 

Mr. Charles Schuchert, while making explorations in southern 
Mississippi, obtained and transmitted to the Museum some interesting 
specimens of mollusks. 

Mr. William Palmer, of the National Museum, sent in a small number 
of specimens. 

Dr. Dall mentions the names of 30 persons who have made collec- 
tions with a view to working out local faunie, and who have in most 
cases contributed types of new species to the Museum, in return for 
the work performed by the department in examination and identifica- 
tion. In this connection it is stated that during the year api)lications 
for information of various kinds were received from 164 persons, and 
that compliance with these requests involved the identification of 3,734 
species of moUusks, besides the in^eparation of a large number of 
letters. 

Material for examination has been lent to Mr. H. A. Pilsbry, of the 
Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadeli^hia, and Mr. Berlin H. 
Wright, of Penn Yan, New York. 

Twenty three papers based upon Museum material have been pub- 
lished during the year by members of the staff" and other collaborators. 
The titles of these papers will be found in the Bibliography ( Ai3j)endix 
IV.) 

At the present rate of progress several years will be required to 
complete the work of cataloguing, labeling, and arranging for reference 
the material now on hand. The Jeffreys collection and the material in 
Professor Verrill's hands nuist be finally administered upon, and the 
duplicates entirely eliminated from the reserves. 

The total number of specimens in the department of mollusks, exclu- 
sive of fossils, is estimated to be 032,300. The fossils number about 
67,000. More than 2,800 entries have been made in the catalogues of 
recent shells. The total registrations of all kinds, including entries 
made in the catalogues reserved for fossils, exceeded 18,000, an increase 
of about 50 per cent over the registrations for the preceding year. 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 49 

DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS. 

The honorary curator of this depaitineiit, Dr. L. O. Howard, states 
that while there has been a decrease in the number of accessions, or 
"lots/' of material received, there has been a marked increase in the 
number of specimens and species represented in these accessions. The 
material is also of greater scientific value. The most important acces- 
sions are here mentioned: 

From Dr. W. L. Abbott, about 4,600 specimens from Troiis, Louver Siam (gift); 
from Rev. D. W. Snyder, 1,410 specimens of insects from Lnebo, Congo (gift); from 
D. W. C()<iuillett, Department of Agriculture, 860 sperimena of Tachinida-, including 
81 type spetimeus (gift); from H. G. Hubbard and E. A. Sclnvarz, Department of 
Agriculture, 69 species of Coleoptera, new to the collection (gilt); from the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, about (500 specimens of Homoiitera, Micro-hymenoptera, and 
Coccincllida- from China, Japan, and Australia, collected by Mr. Albert Koebele 
(gift) ; from Prof. T. D. A Cockcrell, Las Cruces, New Mexico, types of Hymenoptera 
from Mexico and New Mexico; from Prof. 11. Osborn, Ames, Iowa, types of 20 species 
of Homoptera (gift) ; from H. G. Hubbard, Department of Agriculture, a choice collec- 
tion of Hymenoptera from the arid region of Arizona (gift); from Prof. O. F. Cook, 
a collection of European Myriapods (gift); from H. G. Hubbard, Department of 
Agriculture, 118 species of Coleoptera from the West Indies (gift); from the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, 168 specimens of Acridiidie collected in Mexico by C. H. Tyler 
Townseud (gift); from J. G. Foettcrle, Petropolis, Brazil, 115 specimens of Lepi- 
doptera from his locality (gift); from Dr. A. Dugis, Guanajuato, Mexico, a new 
Cyuipid and a new Curculionid from (iuanajuato, Mexico (gift); from Prof. J. B. 
Smith, New Brunswick, New Jersey, 7 types of Acroni/ctas (gift); from the Mus6e 
d'Histoire Naturelle, Geneva, Switzerland, a collection of Orthoptera (exchange). 

The fragmentary exhibition series, owing to the lack of a more suit- 
able place, has been arranged in the hallway leading to the offices of 
the department of insects. On account of the unfavorable conditions 
under wliich the specimens are exhibited, many of them need remount- 
ing, and in some cases new and fresh material should be substituted 
for the old. The study, or systematic, series is in good condition, 
although some additional labels should be supplied. 

The honorary curator states that an effort will be made to arrange 
and determine all the exotic material during the coming winter. 

A considerable amount of scientific work has been accomplished 
during the year, as will be seen from the foUowing paragraphs quoted 
from the report of Dr. Howard: 

Mr. 1). \V. Coquillett has been engaged in monographing the Hies belonging to the 
family Tachinida-, a group of parasitic Hies of great ecououiic importance. The 
work is based largely upon Museum material, and has just been completed. It will 
be published siiortiy as a special bulletin of the Departuient of Agriculture. Mr. 
Coquillett has also nearly comi»leted a revision of the Simulida; in our collection. 

Mr. E. A. Schwarz is monographing the North American Psyllida-. The monograph 
will be based entirely on the extensive collection of these insects in the National 
Museum. 

Mr. W. H. Ashmead is monographing the Hymenopterous family Braconida>, and 
hopes to complete the work this fall. During his studies he has identified and 
rearranged (be collection of these insects in the Museum. Ho has also studied the 
NAT MUS 97 4 



50 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

Ichneumonidfe and some groups of the Micro-hymenoptera, particularly the families 
CyuipidiB and Chalcidid;e, besides doing much work in naming and rearranging the 
Aculeate Hymenoptera, and in labeling and cataloguing the type specimens in all 
orders. 

Prof. Carl F. Baker of Fort Collins, Colorado, is monographing the families Jassidse 
and Cercopida?, and Prof. H. E. Summers is doing similar work with the Hydrobatidfe. 

The explorations of Dr. W. L. Abbott in tbe Malay Peninsula, of Mr. 
Albert Koebele in China, Japan, and Australia, and of Kev. I). W. 
Snyder in the Congo region. West Africa, have resulted in the addition 
to the collections of many new and rare forms. Eeference has already 
been made to the material obtained. During the summer of 1890 Mr. 
Rolla P. Currie made collections in Korth Dakota, Minnesota, Montana, 
and Wyoming. Many of the specimens obtained probably represent 
well-known species, although, a few are rare or new, while others will 
help to fill up gaps in the systematic collection. In November, Mr. Currie 
accompanied Prof. O. F. Cook to Liberia, where he made quite exten- 
sive collections of Arthropoda. The material collected bad not, how- 
ever, reached Washington at the close of the fiscal year. 

In the chapter treating of " Material lent for investigation" a reference 
will be found to the specimens sent out from this department for study. 

Thirty-seven papers based upon material in the Museum have been 
published during the year by members of the staff of this department, 
and five others by persons not officially connected with the Museum. 
The titles of these papers are given in the Bibliography (Appendix IV). 

There were 13,217 specimens received during the year, and 239 
entries were made in the catalogue. The total number of specimens 
uow^ in the collection, including some material which has been received 
on deposit, is estimated at 643,000. 

DEPARTMENT OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES. 

Mr. Richard Rathbun, who was recently appointed Assistant Secre- 
tary of the Smithsonian Institution, continues to act as honorary 
curator of this department. He states that during the year the entire 
collection has been overhauled, the jars supplied with new stoppers, 
when necessary, and the alcohol replenished. Catalogue cards have 
been made for all the specimens entered on the books. Eight collec- 
tions of marine invertebrates have been sent to educational institutions, 
and a considerable number of special collections have been prepared 
and distributed, most of the latter, however, having been sent in 
exchange. 

An exhibit, consisting of five cases of echinoderms, corals, and 
sponges, was prepared for the Tennessee Centennial Exposition, at 
Nashville. The echinoderms were arranged in systematic order, the 
corals and si^onges being grouped in an attractive manner. A fine 
series of commercial sponges, crustaceans, and corals was lent to the 
XJ. S. Fish Commission for its exhibit at Nashville. 

The work of separating the material collected by the Fish Commis- 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 61 

sion and stored at the museum of Yale University lias been carried on 
during the year under the direction of Professor Verrill, although no 
specimens have been received at the National Mnseum. 

The condition of the exhibition and study series is practically the 
same as indicated in the lJei)ort for last year. 

There was an increase of 13 in the number of accessions, the total 
having been 82. The material received from the U. S. Fish Commission 
is not nearly so valuable as that received during the ])ieceding year. 
On the other hand, the value of tlie accessions from outside sources 
has greatly exceeded that of the accessions for 180o-9(j. 

The material of greatest importance is here mentioned: 

One buiulred aud twenty-four microscopic slides of Adriatic sponges (purchase); 
from the State University of Iowa, tbroujih Prof. C. C. Nutting, 14 species of crabs 
and 52 niicroseopic slides of Plnuiularian bydroids, collected ebielly by tbe biolog- 
ical expedition made by tbo University to the Bahamas and Florida Keys in 1893 
(exchange) ; from the Museum of Natural History, Paris, through Prof. E. L. Bouvier, 
72 species of crabs (exchange); from the Koyal Zoological Museum, Turin, Italy, 
throuuh Mr. .Joseph Nobili, 34 species of Crustacea (exchange); from the Koyal 
Museum of Natural History, 15crlin, Germany, 32 species of crabs (exchange); from 
the Zo(»b)gical Museum, Copenhagen, through Dr. F. Meinert, 30 species of oralis 
(exchange); from tbe University of Stockholm, through Prof. Wilhelm Leche, 24 
species of European Crustacea (exchange); from Dr. K. Koebler, Lyons, France, 21 
species of invertebrates dredged in the Gulf of Gascogue (exchange); from Prof. 
D'Arcy W. Thompson, Dundee, Scotland, 16 specimens of Crustacea, chiefly from 
Davis Straits (exchange); from the Museum of Natural History, Geneva, Switzer- 
land, through Dr. N. d'Adelung, 12 species of Crustacea (exchange); from the 
British Museum of Natural History, London, England, 9 species of crabs (exchange). 

Prof. W. P. Hay, Washington, D. C, transmitted 2;") species of Crayfishes, in 
exchange. Many of these were type specimens. Six species of Crayfishes, described 
by Dr. Walter Faxon, were sent, in exchange, by the Museum of Comparative 
Zoology, Cambridge, Ma.ssachusetts. From Cornell University, through Prof. .1. H. 
Comstock, were received 19 species of invertebrates collected by the Cornell expedi- 
tion to Gn'cnland in 1896. Eight species of Crustacea and 5 Japanese sponges were 
purchased. 

Other accessions were as follows: From Mr. F. S. Conant, Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity, Baltimore, 29 species of crabs collected in Kingston Harbor, Jamaica (gift); 
from Dr. E. A. Andrews, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, 17 species of crabs 
collected in the Bahamas (gift) ; from the U. S. Fish Commissi(m, material obtained 
in connection with oyster investigations in Long Ishind Sound in 1890 and 1892 
(gift); from the Fur-Seal Commission, Dr. David S. Jordan, president, invertebrates 
collected in .Japan and the Bering Sea (gift]' ; from Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, U. S.

52 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

Special investigations have been prosecuted by members of tbe staff 
of this department, as follows: 

Mr. Benedict, assistant curator, has made a study of the Isopoda, 
especially those collected by the steamer Albatross. He has deter- 
mined the bulli of the unnamed specimens, and has nearly completed a 
report upon the same, for which a number of drawings have been made. 

Miss Rathbun, second assistant curator, has continued her studies of 
the Brachyura, and has completed a revision of the nomenclature. 
Special studies of the PalicidoB, the fresh-water crabs, and the genera 
Callinectes, iSesarma, and Etliusa., have also been carried on. 

Miss Rathbun was on detached service for four months for the pur- 
pose of visiting the museums of London, Copenhagen, Kiel, Berlin, 
Geneva, and Paris. During her travels many type specimens of deca- 
pod Crustacea were examined, and about 140 photographs made for 
future comparison and study. Exchanges were arranged with the 
museums visited, and one series has already been received from each. 
The number of species represented in these collections is ITO, and the 
number of spe(!imens, 312. Nearly all the species are new to the collec- 
tion, and 28 type specimens are included. 

Some of the museums visited kindly lent specimens of crabs to the 
U. S. National Museum for study. 

Those who Avere especially instrumental in bringing about these 
results were Sir William H. Flower, Mr. Charles E. Fagan, and Prof. F. 
Jeffrey Bell, of the British Museum of Natural History; Dr. F. Meinert, 
of the Zoological Museum, Copenhagen; Dr. K. Brandt, director of the 
Zoological Institute, Kiel, Germany; Dr. K. Mobius, director of the 
Eoyal Zoological Museum, Berlin; Dr. F. Hilgendorf, also of the Berlin 
Museum; Dr. N. d'Adelung and Prof. H. de Saussure, of the Museum 
of Natural History, Geneva, Switzerland; and Prof. A. Milne-Edwards 
and Prof. E. L. Bouvier, of the Museum of Natural History, Paris. 

Material for study and examination has been sent to five specialists 
during the year, and others have prosecuted investigations in the 
department. Further reference to these matters will be found in 
another part of this Report. 

Assistance has been rendered in various ways by persons not con- 
nected with the Museum, as may be seen from the following paragraphs 
taken from the report of the honorary curator : 

Dr. Walter Faxon submitted for publication a report on the crayfishes added to 
our collection during recent years, at the same time returning the specimens upon 
which the report is based, and adding others from the collections of the Museum of 
Comparative Zoology at Cambridge. 

Prof. C. C. Nutting, who is monographing the hydroids, including the large col- 
lection belonging to the Museum, has completed and transmitted for publication 
that part treating of the Plnmu]arid;e. 

Dr. A. Zumbrach was a volunteer assistant in the department from October to 
June, rendering valuable service during that time in translating from the German. 

Mr. W. P. Hay, professor of zoology at the Central High School, who has assisted 
the department in various ways, contributed his entire collection of crayfishes, 
including manj' types. 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSIi^TANT SECRETARY. 53 

Mr. F. S. Morton, Portland, Maine, has mounted and named a number of specimens 
of Foraminifera for the Museum. 

Miss Harriet Richardson lias been a volunteer assistant in the department since 
September, 1896, and has aided in the identification of tlie Isopoda, especially the 
SpIiMioniidii'. Descriptions and tij;ures of several species have already been pub- 
lished 

Fifteen papers based upon ]\Iusenm material have been published 
durini>- the year. ' The titles of these are given in the Bibliography 
(Api^eudix l^'). 

It is proposed to rearrange the exhibits in the west hall of the Smith- 
sonian Building. In carrying out this rearrangement more attention 
will be given to systematic order and a better representation of the 
genera. New cases will be provided. Forms which can not be repre- 
sented properly by specimens will be shown by casts or diagrams. 

Nearly 2,400 specimens were received during the year, the total 
number in the collection l)eing estimated at about 520,000. Eight 
hundred and twenty-five entries were made in the catalogues, as fol- 
lows: Crustaceans, 586 5 worms, 20; bryozoans and ascidians, 10; 
echinoderms and coelenterates, 203; sponges and protozoans, 6. 

HELMINTIIOLOGICAL COLLECTION. 

Dr. C W. Stiles, custodian, reports that four collections have been 
added to the Museum series during the year, namely, the collection of 
the Bureau of Animal Industry, Department of Agriculture, and the 
private collections of Drs. Leidy, Stiles, and Ilassall. These have 
all been received on deposit, with the understanding, however, that 
the duplicate material is subject to exchange with other museums. 
The helminthological collection of the TJ. S. National Museum is now, 
with one or two exceptions, the largest in the world. 

In addition to the material above mentioned, a collection of para- 
sites of seals, obtained by the Fur-Seal Investigation Commission in 
Alaska, Mas received from the Bureau of Animal Industry. 

Owing to limited space it is impossible to satisfactorily arrange the 
study series. There is no exhibition series. No comprehensive plans 
for the further development of the section can be carried out until 
more room is provided. 

Doctor Stiles has completed an extensive revision of the adult ces- 
todes of hares and rabbits. This paper was published in the Proceed- 
ings of the National Museum, lie has also published, as a bulletin of 
the Depiutment of Agricultuie, a paper on tlie tapeworms of poultry. 
Doctors Stiles and Hassall have prepared a paper on tlie parasites 
collected in Alaska by the FurSeal Investigation Commission. An 
extensive report upon certain parasites of meat inspection, by Doctor 
Stiles, is also ready for the press. 

The catalogue entries for the year cover nearly .3,000 numbers. 



54 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

DEPARTMENT OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY. 

Mr. F. A. Lucas, curator of this department, was absent from the 
Museum from June 18 to October 15, 1896, having been detailed to 
accompany the party visiting the Pribilof Islands for the purpose of 
aiding in ascertaining the condition of the fur-seal herds. On June 5, 
1897, he again left for the north on a similar mission.. 

The number of accessions to the collection has been small, although 
such material as has been received is of considerable scientific value. 
The study series is overcrowded, and many valuable si)ecimens are in 
storage. It is possible to employ only a very small force in the prepa- 
ration of material, and facilities for the work are also limited. For 
these reasons no effort has been made to accumulate specimens which 
could not be cared for, and only jiarticnlarly desirable material has 
been accepted. 

A skeleton of an Australian native and a skeleton of a Gangetic 
crocodile were purchased for the exhibit at the Tennessee Centennial 
Exposition. A number of skeletons of mammals, birds, and reptiles 
from Lower Siam, collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott, were transmitted to 
the Museum. The specimens are all in excellent condition and include 
many species not before represented in the collection. 

The exhibition series of the department is in especially good con- 
dition. The study series, although overcrowded, is also well cared for. 
The cataloguing of specimens has been kept up, but owing to the 
absence of the curator and the rearrangement of the cases and speci- 
mens in the exhibition hall, necessitated by the laying of a new 
floor, no great amount of progress has been made in developing the 
collections. 

In speaking of special investigations, Mr. Lucas says: 

In connection with his report on tlie fur-seal the curator has devoted considerable 
attention to the question of dentition and to other anatomical points, as well as to 
the food and breeding habits and diseases of the fur-seal. Tlie food was determined 
almost entirely from osteological material, and in this connection one new genus of 
fishes has been described. The description has not yet, however, been published. 
The curator has also examined and identified the bones collected by Doctor Fewkes 
at the ancient pueblo of Homolobi, and in this connection published a note on an 
ancient Indian dog. The study of species of fossil bison of North America has been 
continued, as well as the study of a new species of fossil shark from Iowa. 

The exhibition series has been studied at various times by students 
from the medical colleges and the high schools. Students and teachers 
have been allowed the use of the dissecting models whenever possible. 
A new genus and species of fossil Skate were described by Dr. C. R. 
Eastman, of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, from 
material sent to him. 

The number of specimens received during the year was 110, repre- 
senting the same number of catalogue entries. The total number of 
specimens now in the collection is 15,395. The last numbers in the

DEPARTMENT OF PALEONTOLOGY. 

The scientific value of the collections received during the past year 
in this department, of which the Acting Assistant Secretary is the 
honorary curator, has exceeded that of the two preceding fiscal years. 

The collection of greatest value was made by Mr. Charles Schuchert, 
assistant curator, in southern Alabama. As a result the National 
Museum now has nearly complete skeletons of Zeuglodon und Dorudon, 
besides much suplementary material. Mr. Schuchert also made a 
small but interesting collection of Ordovician and Devonian fossils in 
Tennessee. 

The U. S. Geological Survey transferred to the Museum seven lots of 
invertebrate fossils, all of which are of considerable value. 

Mr. li. D. Lacoe, Pittston, Pennsylvania, added to the Lacoe Collec- 
tion 208 specimens of Tertiary fossil- plants, many of them being types. 

Mr. Walter Hough, assistant curator in the department of ethnology, 
presented his private collection of Carboniferous fossil plants and 
invertebrates. 

Col. Charles Coote Grant, TTamilton, Ontario, donated two interesting 
lots of Silurian graptolites from his locality. 

Mr. W. S. Gresley, Erie, Pennsylvania, presented a number of spec- 
imens of Lake Siii)erior iron ores, containing probable fossil imprints. 
If these are actually the imprints of animals, they are the oldest 
known fossils. 

Dr. Charles E. Beecher, New Haven, Connecticut, presented a small 
but valuable collection of Devonian phyllopod Crustacea, and two 
models showing the ventral anatomy of trilobites. 

Dr. Wheelton Hind, Stoke-upon-Trent, England, sent an interesting 
collection of Carboniferous mollusca in exchange. 

Prof. E. H. Barbour, of the University of Nebraska, deposited a 
collection of the problematic fossils known as Diemonelix, which was 
afterwards purchased. 

The University of Wyoming, through Prof. Wilbur C. Knight, sent 
an interesting collection of ^lesozoic invertebrates from Wyoming, in 
exchange. 

The type specimens of LepidoxyJon anomalum and Mcf/aphytum gold- 
enber<jii were received in exchange from Dr. J. H. Britts, Clinton, 
Missouri. 



56 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

The Manchester Museum, Owens College, Manchester, England, pre- 
sented fifty-four species of fossils from the Lancashire coal measures. 

A great deal of time has been devoted to the exhibition series of 
fossil vertebrates and fossil plants, but the collections are still in a 
condition far from satisfactory. When the new gallery in the southeast 
court is completed, the former series will be considerably enlarged. 
The Marsh collection of vertebrates should be labeled and the entire 
invertebrate exhibition series mounted upon tiles. All of the fossil 
Medusa? illustrated by the Director of the U. S. Geological Survey in 
a work to be i^ublished by the Survey, will be i^laced upon exhibition. 
Two synoptic collections illustrating the genera, families, and orders of 
the Crinoids and Trilobites have been arranged and mounted on tiles 
for the Tennessee Centennial Exposition, About five months have been 
given to the preparation of the Zeuglodon material collected by Mr. 
Schuchert, and a nearly complete skeleton of this cetacean will soon 
be placed upon exhibition. 

Considerable progress has been made with the study collections in 
the various sectious of this department under the charge of Messrs. 
W. H. Dall, Lester F. Ward, T. W. Stanton, F. H. Knowlton, David 
White, and Charles Schuchert. The material gathered annually by 
these gentlemen is, however, accumulatiug more rapidly than they are 
able to study and finally dispose of. 

The assistant curator has been able to give very little time to original 
research, owing to i^ressure of other work. He has, however, as oppor- 
tunity i)ermitted, continued his studies of the Kortli American fossil 
starfishes. He has also prepared reports on several collections of 
fossils submitted to him by the Director of the U. S. Geological Survey. 
His work entitled Synripsis of American Fossil Brachiopoda, includ- 
ing Bibliography and Synonymy, has been completed, and is in type. 
It will appear as Bulletin No. 87 of the U. S. Geological Survey. 

A number of papers have been i^iiblished during the year by mem- 
bers of the staff of this department. The titles of these appear in the 
Bibliography (Appendix lY). 

The assistant curator devoted a portion of the month of May, 1897, 
to collecting invertebrates from the Devonian strata of western Ten- 
nessee. His explorations in Alabama have already been referred to. 
From the Fewkes expedition of 1896,. through Mr. Walter Hough, an 
interesting collection of Mesozoic invertebrate fossils was received. A 
large quantity of material collected by the paleontologists of the U. S. 
Geological Survey has been deposited in the Museum, but has not yet 
been formally transferred. 

A number of si^ecimens have been lent to Prof. Alpheus Hyatt, of 
Cambridge, Massachusetts, for use in the preparation of a synopsis of 
the class Cephalo^wda. Professor Hyatt also spent a short time at the 
Museum in April, 1897, studying the ammonites. 

Prof. J. F. Whiteaves, of the Geological Survey of Canada, identified

the Miisenm series of Ordovician fossils from the Ked I\iver of the 
North, and Prof. Charles E. Beecher, of Yale iMiiversity. assisted iu 
the arranoenient of the syuoptic (.'ollection of trilobites. 

Collections of fossils, made either directly by the National Museum 
orthroujjh its iiiMuence, are arriving' faster than tlie staff of the.dei)art- 
ment can properly transfer them to the exhibition or study .series. 
Material transmitted from the U. S. Geological Survey is also rapidly 
accumulating. Although this material has served the purpose for 
which it was collected by the Survey, it is not in condition for tinal 
disposition in the study or exhibition series. The services of a pre- 
parator are reijuired, and the specimens must be finally identified and 
registered. Owing to lack of assistance and insuClicicnt drawer-space, 
these collections have been accumulating- for some time past, and there 
are now in storage 880 boxes of i)ractically unworked material. - 

The most important gap in the paleontological collections of the 
Museum is in the vertebrate series. The assistant curator has. during 
the past three years, devoted many months to the work of gathering 
and preparing nuiterial of three skeletons of the large cetacean, Zenylo- 
don cetoldes. More than 2li5 boxes of vertebrate material are in storage 
awaiting preparation. In addition to this the U. S. (leological Survey, 
through Prof O. C. Marsh, of New Haven, desires to gradually turn 
over to the ^NEuseum the vast collections of vertebrate material which 
have been accumulating during the past ten or twelve years. Upon 
the gallery now being constructed iu the southeast court will be ])laced 
the exhibition series of fossil plants which at present occupies the wall- 
cases along two sides of the ground floor in that court. 

The total number of specimens received during the year is estimated 
at 5,.'>(»0. The number of catalogue entries is shown in the following

DEPARTMENT OF BOTANY (NATIONAL nERnAKir:\r). 

^Fr. F. V. Coville, honorary curator of this department, states that 
there were 370 accessions during the year, an increa.se of 134 over the 
previous year. The material received is also of greater scientific value, 
the opportunities for advantageous exchange having been largely 
increa.sed since the transfer of the Herbarium to the National Museum 
building. 



58 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

The following accessions are of especial importance and have mate- 
rially added to the value of the collection : 

Nearly 900 South American plants from Dr. A. Engler, Berlin, Germany (exchange) ; 
1,369 specimens from Mr. F. V. Coville (gift); 981 plants from the Sandwich Islands 
(purchase) ; 1,057 plants from Oregon (purchased by the Department of Agriculture) ; 
1,000 specimens from Dr. W. H. Forwood, Washington, D. C. (gift); 625 Mexican 
lilants purchased hy the Department of Agriculture and about 1,500 Mexican plants 
purchased by the Museum; 424 specimens from Mississippi, collected by Mr. C. L. 
Pollard; 600 specimens from Connecticut, obtained bj- exchange with Dr. E. H. 
Fames, Bridgeport; 500 rare specimens from Xorth and South Carolina, received in 
exchange from Biltmore Herbarium, Biltmore, North Carolina ; 525 plants from Mis- " 
souri (purchase) ; 600 California specimens (purchase); 735 specimens irom India, 
sent in exchange by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Calcutta ; 535 plants from Idaho 
(purchase) ; 1,267 specimens from Montana (purchase) ; 500 West Indian plants (pur- 
chase) ; 600 tropicaJ plants from Dr. E. Warming, Copenhagen, Denmark (exchange) ; 
300 South African plants from Dr. K. Schumann, Berlin, Germany (purchase) ; 382 
Wyoming plants from Mr. A. Nelson, Laramie, Wyoming (exchange); 250 plants 
from Florida (purchase) ; 298 hepatic£e (purchase); 80 i)lants from the islands of 
California (purchase) ; 176 Australian plants from Mr. R. T. Baker, Sydney, Australia 
(exchange); 696 specimens from the Botanical Gardens of St. Petersburg, Russia 
(exchange); 226 African plants from Dr. Hans Schinz, Zurich, Germany (exchange). 

There were also obtained by xmrchase 208 plants from Yucatan, 218 specimens from 
the Azores, 150 algte, 50 specimens of Salix, and 209 Californiau plants. 

Additional material of special value was presented as follows : From Mrs. O. F. 
Cook, W^ashington, D. C, 335 foreign jdants; from Mr. J. M. Macoun, Ottawa, Canada, 
154 Arctic and Canadian specimens; from Mr. E. S. Steele, Washington, D. C, 110 
grasses from the District of Columbia; from Mr. C. H. T. Townsend, 109 Texan 
plants, and from Prof. B. W. Evermann, 139 specimens from Idaho. 

The collection is in excellent condition, although considerably crowded. 
Additional case-room is regarded as necessary if the present satisfac- 
tory development of the Herbarium is to continue. The species are so 
arranged as to be easily consulted, and many of the genera have been 
revised in the light of recent monographs. The old and worn-out genus 
covers have, in a large number of instances, been replaced by new ones. 
The progress made in other directions in caring for the collection is set 
forth in the following paragraphs : 

The storage cases in the tower rooms have been thoroughly overhauled and all old 
collections, with few exceptions, have been mounted and prei)ared for distribution. 

The Herbarium has been stamped almost up to the Leguminosie, making a total 
number of about 18,000. The desirability of completing this count can not be too 
strongly emjihasized, but it would require the exclusive services of a botanical 
assistant for the space of nearly a year. A similar statement might be made with 
reference to the transfer to the Herbarium of the old Museum collection now stored 
on the south balcony and the seiiaration from it of the District herbarium. 

The selection and labeling of type siiecimens has progressed in a very gratifying 
manner. There are now 1,344 types properly labeled and indexed, a large proportion 
of them consisting of species described within the last three years. In this connec- 
tion the growth of the collection is evidenced by the fact that a total of 32,607 
mounted sheets have been added to the Herbarium during the year. This work has 
been performed by two preparators, under the personal supervision of Mr. Pollard, 
the labeling of the types having been directed by Mr. Rose. 

The development of the cryptogamic collection under Mr. Cook's charge has also 
been remarkable, but as Mr. Cook was here for the space of three months only, it is 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 59 

impossible to give any definite statistics in relation thereto. It would be an 
advanta,i;e if this collection could be moved into one of the tower rooms, atlordiug 
more liglit for microscopic study, but there is, unfortunately, no room ou the balcony 
floor available for the ])reparator8 now at work in the tower. 

In alludiiio- to explorations, the honorary curator states that valu- 
able collections have in several instances been obtained by employees 
of the Museum sent out to obtain materials in other groups. Mr. 
Charles Schuchert made collections during a tri}) to Alabama and ]\[is- 
sissippi in October, I.SIX), and Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, during- his trip 
to the islands of Bering Sea, obtained a number of specimens. Mr. 
Pollard, assistant curator, collected a quantity of material while on 
leave from the Museum. Full sets of the specimens collected in Mexico 
by ^Messrs. Xelson and Pringle have been purchased. These are of 
great value. The explorations of the field agents of the U. S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture and the Fish Commission have also resulted in the 
acquisition of much important material. 

Specimens for study and determination have been sent to fourteen 
specialists daring the year, and a number of persons have made deter- 
minations and prosecuted investigations in the department. A more 
extended reference to these matters will be found in another place. 

The following i)aragraphs, from the report of the honorary curator, 
relating to the scientific work of the members of the staff, are of 
interest : 

Mr. Coville has been engaged, in connection with Mr. John B. Leiberg, tield- 
agont of the Department of Agriculture, in preparing a synopsis of the botany of 
the northwest, based ou the collections made in that region under the auspices 
of the Department and deposited in the National Herbarium. Mr. Coville has also 
continued work on the Pan-American Medicinal Flora, which is now in satisfactory 
condition, due in part to the cooperation of Drs. Havard and Rusby. 

Mr. Hose has made determinations of the Polypetahe in the Me.\ican collections 
of Messrs. Nelson, Pringle, and others, and has also begun the determination of 
Dr. Palmer's large collection from the vicinity of Durango, Mexico. He has pub- 
lished several reports on this work from time to time. In the fall of 1896 he was 
commissioned by the Museum to visit the herbaria of the Philadelphia Academy of 
Sciences, Columbia University in New York, and Harvard University for the jjur- 
pose of studying the types of Mexican species. In addition, he has revised the 
genus Chnjmsj)lfinium in North America, and, in connection with Prof. John M. 
Coulter, the genus IJIaopsh (Crantzia). 

Mr. Pollard has continued his work on the new edition of The Flora of the Dis- 
trict of Columbia, which it is proposed to publish as a bulletin of the National 
Museum. In .January Mr. Pollard was commissioned by the Museum to visit the 
herbarium of Columbia University in New York City, wh(sre he spent a week with 
Dr. N. L. Hritton preparing the manuscript for the treatment of the family Cypera- 
cea". for the work above referred to. Mr. Pollard has also coutiiuusd work on the 
Violacea- and Gentianaceie for the Systematic P>otany of North America. 

More than thirty papers, based upon Museum material, have been 
published during the year by members of the staff of the department 
and other specialists. The titles of these papers will be found in the 
Bibliography (Appendix IV). 

The thanks of the Museum are due to Mrs. O. F. Cook, who spent 



60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

several hours each day for about three mouths in assisting Professor 
Cook in his work on the cryptogamic collectious. Dr. B. L. Robinson, 
curator of the Gray Herbarium, Cambridge, Massachusetts, has been of 
great assistance to Mr. Eose in his work on the Mexican collections. 

Mr. Coville recommends the establishment of an exhibition series in 
this department. The science of botany, except in certain economic 
aspects, has never been represented in the exhibition series of the 
Museum. He further states that it is very desirable that the crypto- 
gamic portion of the collection should be developed. Some steps in 
this direction have recently been taken, but in order to carry out any 
comprehensive plan, more space is needed. The necessity of additional 
room for the study series has already been referred to. 

The routine work of the department practically consumes the time of 
both of the assistant curators, leaving very little oi3portunity for the 
prosecution of special investigations. It is therefore recommended by 
the honorary curator that an assistant be emi)loyed, whose duty it shall 
be to look after some of the minor details. 

In May, 1897, Mr. Rose left for Mazatlan, on the western coast of 
Mexico, for the purpose of collecting material illustrative of the botany 
and ethno-botany of the country extending from that point eastward 
across the lowlands and over the Sierra Madre Mountains. A plan of 
work has been outlined by the honorary curator and approved by the 
Acting Assistant Secretary. Through the courtesy of the Mexican 
minister at Washington, the cooperation of the governors of the 
States of Sinaloa and Durango, and other officials, has been secured. 

The total number of specimens received during the year was about 
40,000, of which 32 007 were added to the permanent collection. In the 
catalogue 374 entries were made. 

DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS. 

Prof. F. W. Clarke, chief chemist of the U. S. Geological Survey, 
remains in charge of this dej^artment as honorary curator, with Mr. 
Wirt Tassin as assistant curator. In January, Rev. Dr. L. T. Cham- 
berlain, of New York City, was appointed custodian of the collection of 
gems and precious stones. 

The relative scientific value of the accessions for the fiscal year end- 
ing June 30, 1897, and those of the preceding fiscal year is about the 
same. In the number of accessions, however, there has been an increase 
of more than 50 i^er cent during the year covered by this report. 

From the Australian Museum, Sydney, New South Wales, a series of 
G3 minerals was obtained in exchange. Three specimens of gold pseu- 
domorjih after calverite, and one specimen of telluride, were presented 
by Mr. D. V. Donaldson, Colorado Springs, Colorado. Mr. F. W. Trap- 
hagen presented a specimen of corundum, variety sapphire, in matrix. 
There were deposited by the Smithsonian Institution three pieces of 
the meteorite which fell at Long Island, Phillips County, Kansas, an

emerald crystal in a geode of calcite from Muso mine, United States of 
Colombia, and two cut tonrmalines from Paris, Maine, the latter being 
tlie gift of Eev. Dr. L. T. Chamberlain. A specimen of crystallized cin- 
uabar, collected by J. E. Spnrr, at Mercur, Utah, was transmitted by 
the U. S. Geological Snrvey. Mr. Wirt Tassin collected li44 specimens 
illnstrating the mineralogy of the zinc regions of New Jersey. A col- 
lection of 84 minerals, exhibited by the U. S. (xeological Survey at the 
Cotton States and International Exposition, was turned over to the 
Museum, and from the same source were received 81 specimens of 
covellite from Gray Rock mine, Butte, Montana. A specimen of wire 
silver from Asi)en, Colorado, was presented by Dr. A. S. Eakle, and 
34 specimens of minerals, chiefly from Connecticut, were obtained in 
exchange from Wesleyan University, at Middletown. 

There has been no radical change in the exhibition series during the 
year. Two additional cases have been provided lor the gem collection, 
and all of the gems and precious stones have been remounted. A case 
of specimens illustrating the mineralogy of Sussex County, New Jer- 
sey, has been installed. 

The progress made in caring for the collections is shown in the fol- 
lowing paragrai^hs, quoted from the curator's report: 

The material stored in the armory sheds has been removed to those on Ninth 
street, giving an opportnnity of examining a large number of boxes wliose contents 
■were unknown. The greater part of this material was worthless, and the work of 
assorting and making final disposition of it is still going on. 

Work is progressing, though slowly, on the card catalogue of the collections. 

The gems have all been weighed, measured, examined with the microscoj)e, and 
catalogued, and the manuscrii)t for tlie labels is now in the hands of the priuter. 

The series sent to Nashville has been enlarged by models and Mclditioiuil speci- 
mens, so that upon its return a series defining and illustrating :ill the properties of 
minerals, including their optical jiroperties, will be ready for installation. 

Some 800 specimens belonging to the old collection, but not catalogued, have been 
entered and supplied with numbers. 

The assistant curator has completed a crystallographic examination 
of the minerals of Italian Peak, Gunnison County, Colorado, an under- 
taking requiring over 200 measurements of crystals. He is also meas- 
uring or describing crystallographically the specimens in the systematic 
series, and has already finished tlie sulphides. A catalogue of the 
series illustrating the properties of minerals is nearly completed, and a 
synoptic arrangement of minerals has been prepared and submitted for 
publication. Mr. Tassin has also investigated the use of iodine in the 
rapid determination of minerals. 

Dr. A. S. Eakle was engaged for a time in the study of the topaz 
crystals in the collection. 

The lack of proper facilities for analytical work is seriously felt, and 
the equipment of a suitable laboratory would go far toward increasing 
the value of the collection, which at present contains a large amount 
of undescribed material. 



62 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

There were 1,341 specimens received during the year. The last cata- 
logue entry in June, 1896, was 83747, and in June, 1897, 84279, giving 
a total of 532 entries. It should be stated, however, that a considera- 
ble number of specimens received in previous years have but recently 
been entered on the catalogue. 

DEPARTMENT OF aEOLOGY. 

The curator, Dr. George P. Merrill, states that there were 86 " regular" 
and 176 "temporary" accessions received during the year. In the 
"temporary" accessions, consisting of material received for examina- 
tion, there was an increase of 16 over last year. 

The accessions of greatest imiwrtance were the following: From Mr. 
H. S. Washington, Locust, New Jersey, 42 specimens of volcanic rocks 
obtained in Italy (gift) 5 from Prof. Frank D. Adams, Montreal, Can- 
ada, 14 si)ecimens of rocks from Canada (exchange) ; a drift bowlder 
of native copper, obtained by purchase; from the U. S. Geological 
Survey, 264 si)ecimens of rocks from Nevada City and Grass Valley, 
California, and 252 microscopic sections of rocks from the same locali- 
ties; from Prof. C. H. Hitchcock a series illustrating geological sec- 
tions across Vermont and New Hampshire (exchange) ; a fine series of 
spherulitic liparites, described by Dr. Whitman Cross, and transmitted 
by the U. S. Geological Survey; collections illustrating the petrology 
of Pike's Peak, Cripple Creek, and Gunnison, Colorado, described by 
Messrs. Cross and Penrose, and received from the II. S. Geological 
Survey ; rocks from the Tewan Mountains, collected by Maj. J. W. Powell 
and Mr. W. H. Holmes, and described by Prof. J. P. Iddings, also 
received from the U. S. Geological Survey; a collection of zinc and 
lead ores obtained in Cherokee Oount}^, Kansas, and presented by 
Mr. B. Cooley, of Galena; 10 specimens of gold and silver minerals, 
and 4 specimens of fine native gold and silver, purchased for the 
Nashville Exposition; a collection of Nepheline rocks of Canada, 
from Prof Frank D. Adams, Montreal (exchange); a tine slab of onyx 
marble from San Luis Obispo, California, obtained by purchase, and a 
second slab from the same locality, presented by Mr. Frank Kessler, 
New York City; a large slab of conglomerate from Virginia, showing 
etched quartz pebbles (purchase); a collection of thin sections of rocks 
obtained during the survey of the fortieth parallel, deposited by the 
U. S. Geological Survey. 

But few changes have been made in the exhibition series pending 
the completion of the galleries. 

A large quantity of material which has been in storage for a number 
of years has been overhauled. This included 40 boxes of ores and 
useful minerals received from the General Land Office in 1885, and a 
series of ores collected by the Tenth Census Division of the U. S. Geo- 
logical Survey. The work of assorting and cataloguing these speci- 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 63 

mens is still in progress. About (500 duplicate specimens were picked 
out, identified, and labeled. The card catalogue of the exhibition 
series was nearly completed during the year. The regular work of the 
department has been interrupted by the necessary preparations 
involved in building the new galleries, and also to some extent by the 
preparations for the Nashville Exposition. 

A large amount of time has been given to the work of determining 
and classifying the collections, although some attention has been given 
to the systematic study of rock weathering. Five papers based u])ou 
Museum material have been published by the curator during the year, 
the titles of Avhicli appear in the Bibliography (Appendix lY). 

Under the head of explorations, Doctor Merrill mentions a small 
collection of ores obtained in Mexico by Mr. Edward Palmer, of the 
Department of Agriculture, and the material turned over to the 
Museum by the F. S. Geological Survey, already referred to. 

A number of specimens and thin sections were lent to specialists for 
examination during the year, and Mr. Thomas Means, of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, and Dr. E. C. E. Lord were occu[)ied for a time 
in making investigations in the laboratory of the dei)artment. 

The curator makes the following remarks relative to the further 
development of the exhibition series: 

It is doubtful if, so far as relates to this clepartmeut as at present organized, the 
actual amount of exhibition material should be greatly increased. The additional 
space provided by the galleries will not be more than sufficient for a satisfactory 
display of exhibits at present installed, and it is believed that better results may 
be obtained by carefully -working up and rounding out existing exhibits than by 
installing new ones. The opening of the balconies will necessitate an almost entire 
rearrangement of the materials in the southwest court. It is intended to remove 
what is known as the systematic series of economic products to this balcony, and 
install the building stone exhibit in the wall-cases now occupied by the geographic 
series. This will relieve the overcrowded tloor space and render the systematic 
series more accessible and vastly more attractive. 

There were 394 entries in the catalogue during the year, the number 
of specimens received having been 2,G5G, besides 1,145 microscopic 
slides. The number of si)ecimeus in the different series is shown in 
the following statement : 

Exhibition series 23, (325 

Study series 29, 908 

Microscopic slides 6, 000 

Duplicates 16,072

DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOaY. 

The main dependence of this department for the acquisition of mate- 
rial is divided between the Bureau of Ethnology, the consular service, 
and the Department of Agriculture. Few military exj^editions are now 
sent to the West, and there are no sources of supply other than thosejust

mentioned to take the place of the various Government surveys and 
expeditions sent out in previous years, through which large quantities 
of ethnological material were acquired. During the year just closed 
the total number of accessions was 79. Of the material acquired, how- 
ever, a large proportion was collected under the auspices of the Museum 
for the purpose of filling gaps in the existing series. 

The collection of greatest value was that obtained from the pueblos 
of Arizona by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes. It consisted chiefiy of ancient 
pottery, and of objects of wood, textile, and stone. The curator, Prof. 
O. T. Mason, makes the following reference to this material: 

The value of the Fewkes material consists, first, in the fact that the student who 
is to describe the collection is the one who also made it; secondly, while the modern 
pueblos have been well studied by the various members of the Bureau of Ethnology, 
and we have excellent information Jilso from Dr. Seler and others concerning the 
culture of ancient Mexicans aud tlie inhabitants of Central America, Dr. Fewkes 
has been able to trace out through this large number of examples the symbolism of 
the pueblo worship, and to compare it with that of the more cultured regions lying 
south. It forms, therefore, a connecting link between the study of modern pottery 
made by other students and the old culture of the architectural tribes in Middle 
America. 

Other accessions embracing material of value for study and compar- 
ison are as follows: 

From Dr. W. L. Abbott, 121 specimens, obtained in Lower Siam, and 
12 specimens from the Malay Archipelago; from the estate of the late 
Maj. Charles Bendire, a small collection from Dakota and the northern 
boundary; from Mrs. John G. liourke, a collection of ethnological 
objects; from the Bureau of American Ethnology, 233 specimens, col- 
lected by Mrs. Matilda C. Stevenson; and other small collections 
throngh Mr. W J McGee, Dr. Marcus Baker, and Mr. James Mooney. 
Thirty-seven specimens from Shanghai, China, were purchased; aud 
there were received in exchange from the Canterbury Museum in New 
Zealand 10 ethnological specimens, and from the Hon. John Daggett, 
of California, 18 photographs of Klamath Indians, Dr. J. Walter 
Fewkes presented 108 specimens from the Moki pueblos, and 20 speci- 
mens were received from Mr. A. E. Hippisley. From Mr. E. W. Nelson 
242 Alaskan specimens were purchased, and 91 specimens from 
Durango, Mexico, were obtained in the same manner. Through the 
Hon. W. W^ Rockhill, Assistant Secretary of State, excellent small 
collections of photographs and other material have been received from 
consuls in Korea aud the far East. From Miss E. E. Scidmore were 
received 172 photographs obtained in various parts of the world (gift) ; 
from Eev. D. W. Snyder, 85 objects from Africa (exchange); from Miss 
M. A. Tribolet, 22 specimens from Burmah (gift). 

A collection of objects from the Seminole Indians of Florida was 
purchased. Excellent service in the way of collecting from the tribes 
in the Indian Territory has been performed by Mr. James Mooney, of 
the Bureau of Ethnology. 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 65 

In speaking of the exhibition and study series Professor Mason says: 

So far as the limited spacefill allow, tbe study series is in jjood coiulitiou. A 
portion of it is arranged ethnically and the remainder technically. Especially are 
those objects which have been gathered in the Orient placed ethnically, Itecause 
there is in no case a suflicient amount of material to permit of a satisfactory com- 
parative study. For the American series, the material being much more compre- 
liciisivc, it has been possible to lay out certain large ethnic or culture areas, and to 
regard tlie whole western world as one enclave. In these areas comparative studies 
of considerable range can be made, and therefore objects belonging to each culture 
class are placed together. 

The exhibition series is not in its best condition at the close of the fiscal year, 
because several months of the curator's time have been devoted to the preparation 
of an exhibit for the Nashville Exposition, and it has not been possible to give 
proper attention to this part of the collection. The construction of new galleries 
has also interfered with this portion of the work. It is hoped that in some way 
additional exhibition space may be provided for the ethnological exhibit. The 
specimens have been carefully guarded from destruction by moths or otherwise, and 
those belonging to the study series have been made as accessible as possible. 

The curator states that all of the material assigned to him during the 
year has been catalogued, cleaned and, when necessary, poisoned. Cat- 
alogue cards have also been made out for a large number of the specimens. 
The constant transfer of specimens from the study to the exhibition 
series makes it difficult to keep all of the material exhibited, properly 
labeled. Additional assistance is necessary for the purpose of contin- 
uing the work of checking off on the catalogues such sijecimens as have 
been sent out in exchange during past years. 

Since the beginning of the fiscal year the curator completed the 
proofreading of his paper on "Primitive Travel and Transportation," 
which was published in the Eeport of the National Museum for 1894. 
He has also published several other paper.s, the titles of which will be 
found in the Bibliography (Appendix IV), together with the titles of 
papers published by Dr. Fewkes, Dr. Hough, and Mr. J. D. McGuire. 

Professor Mason has devoted as much time as possible to bringing 
together and studying material for an exhaustive monograph of the 
arts connected with the animal world. A large number of specimens 
and many drawings have been gotten together, and it is hoped that the 
work will be ready for the press during the coming year. Mr. Stewart 
Culin, of the University of Pennsylvania, is still studying the Museum 
collection of games. 

The Poyal Scottish Museum recently sent to the U. S. National 
Museum a number of photographs of objects known to have been col- 
lected by the celebrated geographer Capt. James Cook. These had 
been incorrectly labeled, and it was desired to have them comjmred 
with the large collection here. This matter has now been attended to. 

The following statement regarding scientific work accomplished, and 
services rendered by persons not connected with the Museum, is of 
interest: 

Investigations of great importance have been prosecuted in the department of 
ethnology during the ])ast year. Mr. .J. D. McGuire continued hie studies of the 
NAT MIS 07 5 



66 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

pipes of the North American aboiigiues, and the pictographic work of the Eskimo 
has occupied the attention of Dr. W. J. Hoft'mau. Dr. Fewkcs spent the winter in 
preparing an elaborate report of his researches in Arizona during the past two years. 
Mr. E. W. Nelson, who spent three years in Alaska in the early eighties, and who 
was subsequently compelled to go to Arizona ou account of ill health, recently 
returned to Washington and prepared, with the aid of the force connected with the 
department, a monograjih of his collection, consisting of 7,000 objects. So long had 
this work been delayed, and so necessary to general ethnology was it that Mr. Nel- 
son, who with his own hands collected these treasures, should prepare an account of 
his explorations, that the curator deemed it of the utmost importance that every other 
duty should be laid aside in order to push forward as rapidly as possible this ethno- 
graphic study. The work has now been finished, and the manuscript has been sent 
to the Bureau of Ethnology for publication. Hundreds of drawings and many pho- 
tographic plates were carefully made in order to illustrate the monograph. It is. 
also worth mentioning that with the cooperation of Mr. Nelson all of the specimens 
in our collection kindred to those which he brought together, have attained addi- 
tional imijortance. 

It would be impossible to name all the persons who have willingly served the 
department of ethnology during the past year, but especial attention is called to the 
services rendered by the following i)ersons: Mr. Tappan Adney worked ixp the classi- 
fication of canoes and traps according to forms; Mr. Henry Balfour studied the 
Asiatic bow ; the Hon. John Daggett, of California, studied the material, dyes and 
technique of California Indian basketry; Mr. Samuel J. Entrikin, Chester, Pennsyl- 
vania, gave information concerning the structure of the Eskimo dog harness; 
Dr. J. Walter Fewkes gave information regarding the industrial life of the jjueblo 
Indians; Dr. J. W. Hudson, Ukiah, California, studied the various stitches used in 
California basketry; Dr. W. J. Hoffman studied the methods of mat making among 
the Chippewa tribes; Miss Elizabeth Lemke, of Berlin, investigated the distribution 
of looms of Germany ; Mr. J. D. McGuire, Ellicott City, Maryland, studied the art of 
stone Avorking; Mr. E. W. Nelson gave information on many details connected with 
the technique of the Alaskan Eskimo. Rev. G. B. Winton, San LuisPotosi, Mexico, 
transmitted valuable collections illustrating the survival of ancient Indian arts 
among the modern tribes, and of old Spanish culture in the folk Mexican life. Mr.. 
F. V. Coville has become interested in the study of plants used by the Indians of our 
western country for food, narcotics, clothing, houses, textiles, etc. 

Professor Mason agaiu calls attention to the desirability of directing- 
special effort to the acquisition of such material as will fill gaps in tha 
I)resent series and of acquiring material for new series. He refers to a 
paper which -he recently published in the Report of the Smithsonian 
Institution,' in which he has elaborated eighteen culture areas in the 
Western Hemisphere and divided the products of human activity into- 
seven large classes, indicating in a table what constitutes the necessary 
data for a correct study of the ethnography of these culture regions. 
He suggests the advisability of preparing, in connection with this, a 
statement showing what the Museum already possesses and what is 
still desired, in order that the IsTational Museum may, as far as possible, 
present a complete history of the culture of all the tribes which have 
lived upon the American continent. 

The total number of specimens received during the year, including 
the pueblo material above referred to, is 3,834, and the number of 
catalogue entries 2,721.

REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 67 



DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY, 

The curator of tliis departmeut, Dr. Thomas Wilson, states that the 
material received during- the year has been fully up to the general 
average, so far as scientitic value is concerned. The total number of 
permanent accessions was 117, while 52 lots of material were received 
for examination and report. • 

The accessions of special imi)ortauce are as follows: 

Dr. Eoland Steiner of Groveton, Georgia, deposited a large collection, 
consistingof more than 10,000 specimensof implements and othei'objects 
from an aboriginal village site on the Iviokee Creek, Columbia County, 
Georgia. From the Bureau of American Ethnology was received acollec- 
tion of anti(iuities found in mounds and stone graves in Missouri and Illi- 
nois. The material consists principally of pottery bowls and vases, 
although there are a number of stone implements and otlier objects. The 
collection included altogether about o~>0 specimens. The U. S. Fish Com- 
mission transmitted 41 archeological objects found while excavating for 
fish ])onds at its station at Sau Marcos, Texas, and a collection of about 
350 specimens from the same locality was received from Mrs. Joseph D. 
Sayers. Another collection from the Bureau of Ethnology consisted of 
240 prehistoric stone implements from different localities in Colorado 
and Kansas. These were collected by Messrs. G. K. (Jilbei-t and F. H. 
Newell of the U. S. Geological Survey. Dr. Thomas Wilson deposited 
a series of 10 objects from a stone grave near IsTashville, Tennessee, and 
a collection of 64 objects from the Noel Cemetery, Glendale Pai k, near 
Nashville. From the Smithsonian Institution was received a collection 
of im[)lements an<l other objects gathered by Miss Emma Delafield 
while traveling in ^Mexico several years ago. Dr. Thomas Featherston- 
haugh of Washington, Districtof Columbia, presented 55 objects found in 
a burial cave near Lake Apopka, southern Florida. Miss Georgie L. 
Leonard, Washington, District of Columbia, deposited a hook of luitive 
hammered coi)per, found in the glacial drift in the valley of the Sault 
Ste. Marie River, on the Michigan side. 

Other collections were: From M. de Morgan, Gizeh Museum, Cairo, 
Egypt, a collection of 252 specimens (exchange); from Mr. Clarence B. 
Moore, 1.321 Locust street, Philadeli)hia, a large pottery burial urn 
from a mound in Bryan County, Georgia (gift); from Mr. Henry S. 
Washington, Locust, New -Jersey, a rude stone ax or pick found at 
Beni Hassan, on the Nile, I^jgypt, also a hammer stone from Greece, 
(gift); from Mr. Byron E. Dodge, KiciifieUl, Michigan, a collection of 
30 specimens found in Genesee County, Michigan (di'j)osit); from Dr. 
Felix Adler, New York City, 30 specimens of pottery obtained from 
a cave at Dos Caminos, near Acapuho, Mexico (exchange); from Mr. 
•L W. Emmert, Bristol, Tennessee, 3!J4 specimens, principally from Sul- 
li\au County, in that State, (purchase); from the Canterbury Museum, 
Christchurch, New Zealand, 11 flint knives, scrapers, etc. (gift); from 



68 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

Mr. George H. Scott, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, a small spear-head 
from Bar Eiver, Ontario, Canada; from the Eoyal Museum of Natural 
History, Brussels, Belgium, 82 casts of animal bones and implements, 
the originals of which were obtained from various caverns in Belgium; 
from Mr. John M. Foss, Forbestown, California, a collection of imple- 
ments from Yuba County, in that state (gift); from Mr. H. W. Beck- 
ett, Woodbury, New Jersey, a collection of 45 objects from his vicinity 
(gift); from Mr. Elias Eichards, New Orleans, Louisiana (through the 
Bureau of Ethnology), a polished spade-like implement of dark green 
chlorite (exchange); from Mr. H. C. Duvall, Washington, District of 
Columbia, 4 specimens from various localities (gift) ; and from Mr. John 
C. Abel, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, 201 specimens from the Couestoga 
Hills, near Lancaster (gift). 

The exhibition series is in as good condition as at any previous time. 
Many labels have been added, and others are in course of jjreparation. 
There is no separate study series in the department. During the year 
there have been no radical changes, so far as the installation of the 
collection is concerned. The routine work of the office (including the 
examination of a large number of objects sent to the Museum for that 
purpose) has been heavy. In addition to this, however, the department 
prepared an exhibit, consisting of nearly 1,000 si^ecimens, for the 
Tennessee Centennial Exposition. The work of preparation was per- 
formed mainly by Mr. Upham, the installation of the collection being 
superintended by Dr. Wilson. The transfer to this department of the 
collection of prehistoric pottery, which has recently been completed, 
has added considerably to the work of the oflice. 

In the early i)art of the fiscal year Dr. Wilson completed the proof- 
reading, etc., of his paper on the Swastika. He has also prepared a 
descriptive catalogue of the Steiner collection, and has devoted a con- 
siderable amount of time to other papers. 

The curator has continued to fill the position of professor of prehis- 
toric anthropology in the National University in this city, where he 
delivered a series of lectures during the year. 

The following explorations have resulted in enriching the collections 
of the department: 

Dr. Roland Steiner has continued hia investigations into the Kiokee village site in 
Columbia County, Georgia. 

Mr. John C. Abel, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, has continued his investigation of 
the Conestoga Hills in his neighborhood. 

The curator, while at Nashville, engaged in work connected with the Tennessee 
Centennial Exposition, spent three days in making investigations among the stone 
graves which are to be found in abundance in that locality. He procured the entire 
contents of one of the graves, including the stone coffin and pottery floor, and 
brought them with him to the Museum, where they will be placed upon exhibition. 

Prof. G. K. Gilbert and Mr. F. H. Newell, of the U. S. Geological Survey, collected 
240 archseological specimens during a reconnoissauce in the plains regions of the 
Arkansas River in eastern Colorado. 



REPORT OP ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 69 

M. J;u'([iies de ^Slorgan, of tho Gi/th Muspuiu, Cairo, Egypt, sent to the U. S. 
National Museum 252 specimens of neolithic Hint implements collected hy himself. 

Dr. Wilson was appointed by the Secretary of State to act as com- 
missioner on behalf of the United States to the International Exposi- 
tion, which opened at Brussels in April, 1897. 

About 200 specimens were lent to Mr. J. I). McGiiire for use in con- 
nection with tlie preparation of his paper on prehistoric pijies. 

Several persons have made special studies of the collections in the 
department, as will be seen by reference to the chapter on the work of 
students and investigators. 

The titles of those papers published by the curator during" the year 
which are based upon Museum material are given in the Dibliography 
(Appendix IV). 

There has been no material change in the plans of the curator for the 
future development of the department. These were set forth (piite fully 
in the last Annual Eeport. 

There were 13,840 specimens received during the year. The total 
number of specimens in the department was given in the last Report 
as 209,340. The number of specimens transferred to this department 
from the former section of American aboriginal pottery is estimated at 
20,000, and 15,981 casts, made for distribution to scientific and educa- 
tional institutions, are now accounted for for the first time. This gives 
a total of 250,1(17. Deducting the number of original implements and 
casts distributed during i)receding years and not accounted for, and 
also those sent out during the current year (in all 8,911), the number of 
specimens in the department is shown to be 250,250. 

The last catalogue entry in June, 1896, was 173001, and in June, 
1897, 195271, giving a total of 22,210 entries. The number of speci- 
mens received for examination and report during the year was 174. 

DEPARTMENT OF ARTS AND INDUSTRIES. 

Technological collections. — Mr. J. E. Watkins, curator, has submitted 
separate reports upon the several series embraced in the technological 
collections. These collections are gradually being brought into better 
condition; although, since the appointment of Mr. Watkins as chief 
of the division of buildings and superintendence, it has not been pos- 
sible for him to devote much time to matters i^ertaining to the techno- 
logical exhibits. Such work as has been performed has been done 
with a special view to bringing together and preserving those objects 
which are representative of epoch-making inventions. 

Mr. George C. Maynard has rendered important service as custodian 
of the electrical collections. The prospects for building up an interest- 
ing series of historic electrical apparatus are very gratifying, and sub- 
stantial progress has already been made. 



70 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

The following tentative classification of the technological collections 
has been adopted for convenience in administration: 

TraQsportation and engineeriug: 
Transportation by laud — 
Yeliicles without wheels. 
Vehicles with wheels. 
Transportation by water — 
Rafts and primitive crafts. 
Sailing vessels. 
Steamboats and steamships. 
Electrical engineering — 
Telegraph. 
Telephone. 
Light and heat. 

Motors, stationary and for traction. 
Machines and appliances of historical interest. 
Textiles (arranged to show the history of the art of weaving). 
Animal products (arranged to show the result of human effort in utilizing the 

products of the animal kingdom). 
Foods (arranged to show the adaptation of the products of the animal, vegeta- 
ble, and mineral kingdoms to supply food for man). 
Physical apparatus. 

The most iraj)ortant addition to the transportation collection, from 
an historical point of view, was a poster, dated October 9, 1821, of a 
stage-coach line between Providence, Ehode Island, and Worcester, 
Massachusetts. This poster was presented by Mrs. S. H. Olmstead. 
The first machine used in the manufacture of baskets, known as the 
Horton automatic basket machine, was received from Mr. E. G. DuBois, 
Washington, District of Columbia. The original working model of the 
first boiler-riveting machine, using steam as the power, was presented 
by Mr. Charles H. Haswell, New York City. 

In this section the exhibition and study series are combined, and the 
collections are in fair condition, considering the limited space avail- 
able. Yery little progress has been made in administering upon them 
during the year, owing to the fact that the time of the curator has been 
taken up with other matters. A small synoptical series was prepared 
for the Tennessee Centennial Exposition. Whenever additional space 
shall be provided, the collection will be entirel}^ rearranged. 

Three entries were made in the catalogue during the year, embracing 
the same number of specimens. 

The electrical collections have been increased through the courtesy 
of Miss ]\Iary A. Henry, who deposited additional specimens relating 
to Professor Henry's discoveries in electro-magnetism. Some pieces 
of apparatus were also received from the Smithsonian Institution. 
Eeg^rding this collectioji Mr. Maynard says: 

An eifort has been made to assemble and place on exhibition the Henry relics, for 
which a suitable case has been provided. In this undertaking the Museum has 
received the valuable cooperation of the daughters of Professor Henry, who have 
deposited many valuable objects illustrating his work and showing iu some measure 
the recognition he received for it from scientific men throughout the world. 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 71 

A considerable number of pieces of Henry's experimental apparatus has also been 
received from the Smithsonian Institution. The apparatus made by Henry in 
1831 for Yale University, and deposited by that institution, and other apparatus 
illustrating the important original work done by Henry, also form parf, of the col- 
lection. At this time, when the whole world is enjoying immense benefits from 
numerous electrical appliances which have grown out of the discoveries made l)y 
Henry in his early researches, this apparatus used by him, much of it constructed 
with his own hatuls. jjossesses an intense interest. It forms a suitable beginning for 
a collection of historical electrical apparatus showing the various stages in teleg- 
raphy, telephony, electric lighting, and kindred industries, the history of which — 
yet to be written — reflects much credit upon .loseph Henry and the Smithsonian 
Institution. 

Mrs. Isabella Field Judson presented a large number of objects 
relating" to tlie laying of the early trans-Atlantic telegrapli cables and 
the work of Cyrus W. Field in coiiiieetion with that enterprise. Tliis 
collection includes specimens of the original cables i)reserved by 'Sir. 
Field himself, with his charts and autograph records of the first cable- 
laying expeditions. 

The Western Union Telegraph Company and the Telegraphic His- 
torical Society deposited several specimens of original apparatus show- 
ing the development of the telegraph in this country. Mr. F. W. 
Hawley, of Xew York City, presented an electric motor which was 
operated by a current generated at Niagara Falls and transmitted to 
New York City, a distance of 453 miles, over commercial wires of the 
Western Union Telegraph Company. 

A large number of interesting and important objects can not be 
placed upon exhibition owing to lack of space. 

A great deal of time has beeu devoted to the classification and 
arrangement of the collections, the preparation of a catalogue, and an 
investigation of the history and authenticity of numerous objects not 
heretofore fully identified and described. 

Models illustrating some of the discoveries and inventions of Frank- 
lin, Henry, Morse, and Page were sent to the Tennessee Centennial 
Exposition. 

Correspondence has been entered into with Mr. Thomas A. Edison, 
Prof. Elihu Thomson, JNIr. Charles F. Brush, the General Electrical 
Company, the Western Union Telegraph Company, and other indi- 
viduals and firms prominent in electrical matters, and gratifying assur- 
ances of cooperation have been received. Assistance in furnishing 
information or in searching for historical objects has been rendered by 
the following persons: Gen. Thomas T. Eckert, presidentof the Western 
Union Telegraph Company, and Messrs. C. A. Tinker and A. S. Brown, 
of the same com[)any; ]\Ir. Edward L. Morse, Yonkers, New York; 
Dr. Henry M. Field, New York City; Mr. T. C. Martin, editor of the 
Electrical Engineer, and Mr. S. H. Kauffmann and other officers of 
the Telegraphic Historical Society. 

Work has been outlined for the future as follows :

the collections ancl the completion <»l' :iii aci-urate eatalogiu) and historical record of

them; the gradual establishment of a complete collectiou of historical apparatus 
showing the development of the art of generating electricity and its application to 
various scientific and industrial purposes, such as telegraphy, telephony, electric 
lighting, power, heat, etc. ; the preparation of a series of models of epoch-making 
apparatus illustrating the more important discoveries in electrical science, com- 
mencing with the voltaic pile and continuing down to the intensity magnet of 
Henry. 

Two hundred and fifty-three specimens have been received, the total 
number in the collection being 395. There were 276 entries in the 
catalogue. 

The additions to the collection of naval architecture show an increase 
in value over the specimens received in the preceding year. A small 
pamphlet entitled A Treatise on the Application of Steam, by James 
Eumsey, published in 1788, constitutes the most important accession. 
This was presented by Thomas Eumsey. A model of the ship America, 
in which all the sails and imijortant parts — about 425 in number — are 
labeled, was constructed and sent to Kashville for exhibition at the 
Tennessee Centennial Exposition. A model of the ship R. F. Stocl-ton, 
the first steamboat with an iron hull and also the first steamboat with 
a screw propeller to cross the Atlantic, was built and placed on exhi- 
bition in the Museum. 

The collection of naval models is not fully labeled, but it is hoj)ed 
that arrangements may be soon made for having this work done. The 
wall-cases in the exhibition hall have been enlarged, rendering possible 
the better arrangement of the models. Although no study series 
exists, the needs of the student have been considered in the arrange- 
ment of the exhibition series, and they will also be considered in the 
preparation of the labels. Many of the models are in need of repairs, 
and this matter will also receive attention. It is proposed to complete 
the series, so far as the means at command will allow. 

Five specimens were received during the year, involving the same 
number of catalogue entries. The total number of specimens in the 
collection is estimated at 1,336. 

There have been no additions during the year to the collection of 
textiles. A large number of unit boxes have been overhauled and a 
tentative exhibit arranged. As soon as the galleries are completed, it 
is hoped that an opportunity will be afforded to permanently arrange 
the exhibition series. Labels should also be provided and the gaps 
filled, as far as possible, with material now in storage. The study 
series requires attention as well. 

A tentative arrangement of the exhibition series of the collection of 
animal products has also been effected. It is hoped that considerable 
progress may be made during the coming year both with the exhibition 
and the study series. 

The collection of physical apparatus, formerly in charge of Mr. W. 
C. Winlock, has been placed in the care of Mr. Watkins, but it has 
not yet been possible to give the collection the attention which it 
deserves. 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 73 

nistorical collections. — There has been a decided increase in tlie num- 
ber of specimens received during- the year, as well as in their scientidc 
value. The number of accessions or lots of material has not. how- 
ever, been above the average, there having been 43 ''permanent'' and 
19 " temporary '' accessions. 

The most important additions were as follows: 

A collection of the coins of the Chinese Empire from 770 B. C. to 
date, comprising- L',0L*5 pieces in gold, silver, and bronze, and including 
governmental and private notes, amulets, and bamboo tallies. This 
collection was beipieathed to the Smithsonian Institution by Mr. G. B. 
(Jlover, an American gentleman connected for many years with the 
Maritime Customs Service of China. It is believed to be the most 
complete series of Chinese money in the world. 

A collection of bronze medals of the sovereigns of France was obtained 
by purchase. The series comprises 75 pieces, all of which are in perfect 
condition. 

Mrs. A. B. Van Deusen deposited a collection of ceramics, consisting 
of -04 plates, pitchers, etc., illustrative of American history. 

A collection of relics of the Kevolutionary war was deposited by the 
Society of the Daughters of the American Eevolution. 

A sword presented to Gen. Gabriel R. Paul by his command was 
deposited by Col. Augustus C. Paul, Soldiers' Home, Hampton,Virginia. 

]\Irs. Abner Doubleday transmitted a sword worn by General Double- 
day during- the war of the Revolution, 

Students of history have in a number of instances received i)ermis- 
sion to make jihotographs or drawings of objects on exhibition, to be 
used in illustrating works intended for publication, especially in con- 
nection with the biographies of General Grant and other soldiers of 
the late war. The Washington relics have frequently been examined 
by writers of colonial history. 

Tliat ])ortion of the collection Avliich is on exhibition is in good con- 
dition, and there are many objects of historic interest which could be 
advantageously displayed if there were room. Much remains to be done 
in arranging the study series. 

Mr. A. Howard Clark, custodian, makes the following statement with 
reference to the work performed in caring for the collections : 

During the i>ast three uioiifhs much progress has been iiiado in catiiloguing and 
]»ernianontly arranging the valuable collection of coins and medals belonging to the 
Museiim. Several series have been placed on exhibitlou, aud the ditlicult problem 
of installing large series of coins has been solved by the use of upright cases with 
sloping diaphragms covered with olive-green velvet. 

A great deal remains to be done to complete the labeling of the collection, but 
the work is steadily progressing. 

The series of portraits of representative men has been increased somewhat, and 
the entire collection has been arranged for ready reference. 

Considerable time was devoted to the preparation of a collection of 
medals and coins pertaining to the colonial period of American history, 
for display at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition at Nashville. 



74 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

It is proposed to build up and exhibit a complete series of tlie pres- 
ent coinage of all countries, and to provide labels showing the commer- 
cial and intrinsic value, fineness, and comparative value with the coins 
of the United States. Such a collection, it is believed, would be of great 
interest to the public and to students. 

A very large series of medals of various countries is now in storage 
but inaccessible to the public. This will be placed upon exhibition as 
soon as the necessary space is provided, as will also a series of iDortraits 
of representative Americans, such as was shown by the Museum at the 
World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. 

The number of specimens received during the year was 3,441, and 
the total number of specimens in the collection is estimated at about 
35,000. There were 441 entries made in the catalogue. 

Oriental antiquities and religious ceremonials. — Dr. Paul Haupt 
remains in charge of the collection of oriental antiquities as honor- 
ary curator, while Dr. Cyrus Adler holds the position of assistant cura- 
tor in this deiiartnient and also that of custodian in the section of 
religious ceremonials. 

Although the number of accessions for the year was considerably 
less than for the preceding year, the number of specimens included in 
these accessions shows an increase of more than 100 per cent. The 
material received during 1896-97 is also of greater scientific value. 

From St. John's College, Shanghai, China, a collection of objects 
used in Buddhist worship and illustrating the form of the ceremonial 
of that religion in China was received in exchange. A small collec- 
tion of Buddhist and Mohammedan objects from India was purchased, 
as was also a collection of objects of Christian ceremonial. While 
many of the other accessions contained material of interest and value, 
these were the most important. 

In the chapter entitled "Development and arrangement of the exhi- 
bition series" will be found a statement relating to the present condi- 
tion of the collections on exhibition and the changes recently made. 

An exhibit comprising 167 objects was prepared for the Tennessee 
Centennial Exposition at jSTashville. 

Dr. Adler has completed a description of the exhibit of Biblical 
science at the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta, 
embodying also the results of recent discoveries and researches in the 
domain of Biblical and oriental archaiology. This paper is published 
in Part II of the Report of the National Museum for 1896. A study of 
ancient oriental seals is in ])rogress. 

During the year a number of persons have received information or 
assistance in one way or another with reference to antiquities. 

Dr. Adler has prepared and published a short paper on the Cotton 
Grotto, an ancient quarry in Jerusalem, and Dr. I. M. Casanowicz 
published in the American Anthropologist during the year a paper 
entitled "Tel-et Tin on Lake Ilomis, in the Valley of the Oroutes." 



REPORT OP ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 75 

It is proposed to rearrange and relabel a ])<)rtion of tlie Egyptian 
collection and to reinstall the Jewish and Mohammedan collections. 
The method of arranging- and exhibiting- objects of Christian cere- 
monial in other museums will be studied. 

About 270 labels for specimens luive been prepare<l during^ the year. 

Dr. Adler states that it is desirable that opi>ortnnity and facMlities 
be altbrded for the preparation of a descrij)tion of the Bengniat loan 
collection of Jewish ceremonials, which is one of the most complete 
and valuable collections of its kind in existence. 

The total number of specimens received was 628, the number of speci- 
mens now in the collection being- 3 648. There were 50 catalogue 
entries made during the year. 

Graphic arts. — Although Mr. S. E. Koehler, of the Boston ^Museum 
of Fine Arts, is still in charge of this section, he has been able to give 
but little attention to the work during- the past year. The most impor- 
tant accession was a series of photographs from paintings, obtained 
by purchase. The only other addition was a chromo-collo<i^raph, pre- 
sented by the Heliot^'pe Printing- Company of Boston. 

As previously stated, tiie collection has now reached a stage where 
very few additions of value can be expected, except by purchase. 

Materia medica. — Dr. James M. Flint, U. S. Navy, honorary curator, 
states that the specimens in the exhibition and study series are in 
remarkably good condition, considering- their ])erishable nature. For a 
considerable portion of the year the exhibition series, which is installed 
in the northeast ccmrt, was not accessible to the i)ublic owing to the 
preparations for the Tennessee Centennial Exposition, which made it 
necessary to close some of the halls temporarily. After this work had 
been completed and the exhibit again rendered accessible, the speci- 
mens were carefully examined and everything- put in order. Xo etfort 
has been made to increase the collection, owing to lack of space for the 
exhibition of any more material. Manuscript for a number of labels 
has been prejiared. 

As it is impossible under present conditions to do very much toward 
the further development of the collection, Dr. Flint has given a large 
proportion of his time to the investigation of the Foraminifera collected 
by the U. S. Fish Commission. As a result of his studies he has pre- 
])ared a paper entitled ''A Descriptive Catalogue of the llecent Forami- 
nifera collected by the U. S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross, and 
MOW on exhilntion in the National ^Museum." This paper is printed in 
I'art 1 1 of the i^resent volunie. A reference was made in the last annual 
report to the instrument devised by J)r. Flint for the exhibition of 
Foraminifera and other microscopic specimens. 

The (uirator states that the direction in whicli the collection of 
materia medica can be most advantageously extended is toward a more 
comi)lete exhiljit of organic chemical products, now so extensively 
used in medicine. 



76 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

Only five sj)ecimens were added to tlie collection during the year and 
none of them were of particular importance. The total number of 
specimens now in the collection is 6,330. 

Musical instruments. — There were three accessions of importance 
during the year. Dr. W. L. Abbott i^resented 11 musical instruments, 
collected during his travels in the east, and Messrs. H. A. and F. H. 
Vinton, of Bedford, New York, presented a spinet supposed to have 
been made about the middle of the seventeeth century. A few Chinese 
musical instruments were collected for the Museum by Lieut. C. G. 
Calkins, U. S. N. 

FJiotograpMc collection. — Mr. T. W. Smillie was on July 15, 1896, 
designated custodian of the collection illustrating the history of pho- 
tography. Although the photographic exhibit is recognized for the 
first time in the present Report as an established section, as long ago 
as 1888 a series of specimens showing the uses of ijhotography was 
prepared for the Ohio Centennial Exi^osition, held at Cincinnati. This 
collection included portrait and landscape cameras of early types, a 
complete daguerreotyper's outfit, and examples of cameras of various 
kinds in use at the time of the Exposition. The daguerreotype, talbo- 
type, albumen, collodion, and gelatine negative processes were also 
illustrated. There were examples of prints made by various processes, 
of transparencies, and of transferotypes on paper, canvas, and porce- 
lain. Another series was intended to show the value of photography 
in the study of astronomy, geology, biology, and medicine, as an aid 
to the artist and engraver and to the scientist in recording the fluctu- 
ations of various instruments. 

Since the Exposition at Cincinnati a considerable quantity of material 
has accumulated, especially during the past two or three years, and 
there is every reason to believe that a valuable and interesting collection 
can be built up. The design is to bring together an exhibit illustrative 
of the history and uses of j)hotography, beginning with the earliest 
authentic discoveries in the art and grouping them chronologically up 
to the present day. 

The following statement, taken from the report of Mr. Smillie, indi- 
cates the scope of this collection and the plans for its further develop- 
ment: 

The collection includes a fine series of portrait, landscape, and marine daguerreo- 
types; an original daguerreotype of Daguerre; also a panorami'c view, about 4 feet 
long, of the harhor of San Francisco in 1852, showing the dismantled fleet of the 
Argonauts, a remarkable piece by Shew, of California. 

There are also specimens of the ambrotype, erysotype, the asphalt process, the 
various silver processes, the carbon process, the aniline process, etc. In fact, the col- 
lection, although small, is so rich in the earlier processes, which are passing away, 
that it will be comparatively easy to fill up the blanks. 

At the photographic exhibition recently held in the hall of the Cosmos Club in 
Washington the Museum secured, partly by purchase and partly by donation, over 
50 examples of the best work of the present day by the leading amateur and profes- 
sional photographers of the United States. 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 77 

Comparatively little has been done to illustrate the work of the last ten years, 
and an offort is now beiuy; made to complete the series, so that it will he a worthy 
nprt'sentationofthc progress of the art. The acquisition of the prints from the Wash- 
ington Exposition of 1S96 is a step in this direction. 

An elfort will be made hereafter, especially in connection with the future exposi- 
tions of amateur work, to secure such specimens as are necessary to make the collec- 
tion in the National Museum a reference and record collection, which shall be not 
only of interest and pleasure to the jjublic, but of jtractical value to photographers 
themselves. 

It is unnecessary to enlarge upon the importance which such a collection as this 
must have to every i)hotographer — a collection in which he may see, side by side, 
the best works produced from year to year, and stndj' the effects of light and time 
upon the permanence of paper and processes. 

The pictures recently bought by the Museum were chosen with the idea that they 
represent as fully as possible the dift'erent schools of amateur photograj)hy in Amer- 
ica at the present time and the work of as many as possible of the most character- 
istic and representative artists. The fact is fully recognized that the development 
of these schools is sought in amateur photography rather than among professional 
})hotograi)hers, whose work is of necessity more conventional in its character and 
atlbrds less opportunity for originality and progress, although the fact was recog- 
nized that several ]>rofessioiial ])hotograi)hers were rei)resented in the exhibition, 
and characteristic specimens of the work of each of these were also secured. 

Owing to the pressure of other work, Mr. Smillie has found but little 
time to devote to the development of the photograi)hic collection dur- 
ing the year covered by this Report. Fort}'- seven specimens were 
received, all of them being unsolicited donations. Miss L. Bernie 
Gallaher presented 20 daguerreotypes, 3 ambrotyi)es, and 1 melano- 
tyi)e; Miss Frances Benjamin Johnston contributed a platinum por- 
trait; Mr. 0. W. Canfield a stereoscopic melanotype; Mr. J. W. Osborn 
19 portraits of celebrated photographers, and Mr. Alexander Beckers 
1 hand stereoscope and 1 revolving stereoscope. 

The total number of specimens now in the collection is 1,284. 

It has been necessary to devote some attention to the preservation 
of the specimens, many of the old and valuable daguerreotypes show- 
ing signs of fading from exposure to the air. These have now been 
resealed. 

The work of preparing specimens for exhibition has been carried on 
as opportunity permitted. 



IV. -REVIEW OF WORK IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE 
DEPARTMENTS. 

FINANCE, PROPERTY, SUPPLIES AND ACCOUNTS. 

Ill Appendix VIII will be found a statement showing the amount of 
tlie appropriations for the present fiscal year, the disbursements during- 
the same period, and the balance available June 30, 1897, for the pur- 
j)ose of meeting outstanding liabilities. 

The following remarks are quoted from the report for the current fis- 
cal year, submitted by Mr. J. L. Willige, acting chief clerk : 

On January 27 Mr. W. V. Cox was designated by the Secretary as special repre- 
sentative at Nashville of Dr. True, representative of the Institution and the Museum 
on the board of management of the Government exhibit at the Tennessee Centen- 
nial Exposition. It is probable that he will remain in Nashville almost continuously 
until the close of the exposition. 

On the 2d of February Mr. J. L. Willige was, upon the recommendation of the 
acting assistant secretary, designated acting chief clerk, and on the 12th of the 
mouth assumed charge of tlie office. 

There has been a considerable increase in the work of the office in certain direc- 
tions. In addition to the preparation of financial statements and other information 
required in regular course, the following classes of routine work may be particular- 
ized: More than 1,600 orders for the purchase of supplies and the performance of 
services have been issued on approved requisitions (an increase of approximately 
200 over the preceding year) ; nearly 1.200 inside requisitions have been registered on 
account of supplies furnished from the stock in the property clerk's office, and 
services performed by the regular employees of the Museum ; record has been kept 
of requisitions for articles of furniture and fixtures already made and in stock ; 
approximately 900 vouchers have been examined and certified to the disbursing 
clerk for payment, and more than 1,500 pages of letters and memoranda have been 
coiiied in the letter-jiress books. 

The participation of the Institution and its dependencies in the Tennessee Cen- 
tennial Exposition, which opened at Nashville on the 1st day of May and will con- 
tinue until the 31st of October next, devolved a considerable amount of extra work 
u^iou the office. The work has been accomplished, however, without additional 
clerical service. There were issued on account of the Exposition 211 orders for the 
purchase of specimens and material and for the performance of special services; 
375 pages of letters were written, and 126 vouchers, aggregating in payments 
$11,041.42, were prepared, in addition to statements of expenditures and liabilities, 
showing the condition of the allotment from time to time. 

The placing of the several dependencies of the Institution within the limitations 
of the civil-service law necessitates additional records and correspondence, and 233 
reports and letters written are chargeable to this account. 

An elaborate statement, in tabulated form, has been prepared, showing the amounts 
appropriated by Congress for the support of the bureaus under the direction of the 
Institution, and the aid rendered from the .Smithsonian fund and other sources, from 
the date of the Wilkee exploring expedition in 1836 down to the present year. 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 79 

Tlie ollices of superiuteiideut and assistant superintendent of build- 
ings and labor were abolished October 19, 180(5, and the division of 
buildings and superintendence created. Mr. J. E. Watkins was desig- 
nated chief of the division, with instructions to report directly to the 
executive curator. 

The membership of standing committees at the beginning of the 
present fiscal year was as follows : Ou insjiection, Mr. Lucas (chairman), 
Messrs. Goldsmith and Tlawley; on condemnation, Mr. Brown (chair- 
man), ]\Iessrs. Goldsmith and iStenart; ou lumber, JNIr. Horan (chairman) 
and Mr. Goldsmith, with W. H. Haney as advisory member. On July 8 
Mr. Tassin was designated a member of the committee on insj)ection 
to replace, temporarily, Mr. Lucas, detailed for duty in Alaska. The 
committee on lumber has been reduced to Messrs. Goldsmith and 
W. II. Ilaney. 

Special committees were appointed during the year, as follows: Pro- 
fessor Mason and Messrs. Schuchert, Xewhall, Watkins and lirown, 
to examine Museum material in storage at the Armory Ijuilding, with 
a view to condemning any objects no longer serviceable; Messrs. Gold- 
smith, ►Steuart, Schucnnann, Berry, ^NFcDevitt, and Baker, to o])en bids 
for furnishing supplies during the current fiscal year and to recom- 
mend awards ; Messrs. Goldsmith, Bean, Berry, Schuermann, McDevitt, 
and liakcr, to open and examine proposals for furnishing su])])lies dur- 
ing the coming year; Messrs. Tassin, Kichmond, and Bean, to examine, 
with a view to condemnation or other disposition, certain books and 
labels in the editor's office. 

The various bureaus of the Smithsonian Institution having been 
made subject to the civil-service law by order of the President, a clas- 
sification of the employees was transmitted to the Civil Service Com- 
mission on July .), 1800, together with a tabulated statement of the 
number of employees in each class. 

The civil-service rules require that the head of each department or 
bureau of the Government shall nominate not less than three persons 
who shall be members of a board of promotion, and in accordance 
with this regulation the following officers were nominated as members 
of the Smithsonian board : Mr. W. V. Cox, chairman. Prof. O. T. Mason, 
and Dr. Frank Baker. On June 8, 1807, ^Mr. J. L. Willige, acting chief 
clerk, was instructed to act as chairman of the board during the 
absence of Mr. Cox on duties connected with the Tennessee Centennial 
I">xi>osition. By direction of the Secretary, the chief clerk of the 
Museunj will be chairman e.r o[lici<f. Ail correspondence l)etween the 
Commission and the Institution relating to the Museum or to the other 
Bureaus of the Institution will be conducted through the ollice of the 
Secretary by the (;hief clerk of the Museum. 

The Assistant Secretary of Agriculture invited the cooi)eration of the 
Smithsonian Institution in establishing a uniform standard of require- 
ments for scientific assistants in the several bureaus of the Government, 



80 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

the object being to secure assistants witli any desirable combination of 
qualifications and to simplify the operations of the civil-service law so 
far as these bureaus are concerned. Assurance was given of hearty 
cooperation on the part of the Institution. 

Considerable attention has been devoted to systematizing the records 
and files relating to civil-service matters. A card catalogue has been 
started, upon which decisions of the commission are recorded; also a 
catalogue embracing the names of all employees of the Smithsonian 
Institution and its dependencies. 

During the year there have been fifteen requests for certification of 
eligible applicants for appointment, nine transfers from the Institution 
to the several departments, four reinstatements, and eight emergency 
appointments. Twelve monthly reports have been submitted and 163 
letters written relating to civil service matters. 

Upon recommendation of the chief clerk, and with the approval of 
the Secretary, a law reference library has been established. It is 
intended to include in this library publications relating to the origin 
and establishment of the Institution and the Museum, the Eevised 
Statutes of the United States, Journalsof Congress, decisions of Comp- 
trollers, opinions of the Attorney-General, reports of the Civil Service 
Commission, directories, and other works of reference. Through the 
courtesy of the Secretary of State, a copy of the Eevised Statutes and 
supplements has been received during the year. The reports of the 
Civil Service Commission have been added, and a series of Congres- 
sional Records and Globes — more than two hundred volumes in all — 
have been transferred from the general library of the Institution. Mr. 
W. W. Karr, Dr. Cyrus Adler, and Mr. W. I. Adams were designated 
by the Secretary as a committee to cooperate with the chief clerk in 
the selection of books for the library. 

The oath of allegiance has been administered to all of the employees 
of the Institution and its bureaus, as required by law. 

The attention of Congress has been called to the necessity of increas- 
ing the scientific staff and enlarging the force of clerical employees, 
watchmen, laborers, and cleaners. 

It was estimated that the sum of $8,000 would be required to make 
all necessary repairs to the Museum building during the coming year, 
but only half that amount has been appropriated for this purjiose. 
Attention was also called to the need of additional skylights. No 
appropriation has, however, been made for use in this direction. 

In the sundry civil act for 1896-97 the sum of $8,000 was appro- 
priated for the erection of galleries in two or more halls of the Museum 
building. Steps were promptly taken toward the construction of the 
galleries thus provided for, and on November 25, 1896, a committee, 
composed of Mr. Cox (chairman), Mr. Watkins and Mr. Lucas, was 
appointed to consider plans and recommend the award of contracts. 
Later, Prof. O. T. Mason was designated to act as a member of the 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 81 

committee, to serve in the place of Mr. Lucas, wlio had been assioned 
to special duties iu counection with the Fur-Seal Commission. The 
cbairmau was relieved ou June 5 by Mr. Willige, acting" chief clerk. 
Contracts for the construction of the galleries were duly awarded and 
the work has progressed satisfactorily. In the aj)i»r()priation for the 
fiscal year ending June 30, 1898, an additional sum of >=8,0(H) has been 
provided for the continuation of the construction of galleries, thus 
allowing for their extension into the oast, west and soutli halls. 

A reference was made in the last Keport to the lease of new prem- 
ises for workshops and storage purposes. A formal agreement was 
entered into on July 1, 189G, for the present fiscal year, with the privi- 
lege of renewal for five years, if desired. Two frame buildings, each 
100 feet long, 25 feet wide, and one story high, were erected by the 
owner. It was hoped that it would be possible to transfer the material 
in the shed adjacent to the armory buihling to the new storage quar- 
ters, but this was found to be impracticable, and it was therefore 
recommended that an additional building be erected between the two 
existing sheds on Ninth street, and that these two sheds be extended. 

Provision has been made in the appropriations for the coming year 
for the removal of the sheds south of the Smithsonian buihling. They 
will probably be rebuilt on the ground leased by the Museum on Ninth 
street. The need for suitable fire protection for the Museum property 
stored at this place is urgent. 

A number of applications for the use of the lecture hall have been 
granted during the year. When lectures are given at night, it is 
necessary that additional watchmen, firemen, and other attendants be 
provided, and if the lantern is used, a skilled operator is required. 
The society or association asking the privilege of using the hall, 
assumes tlie expense of such additional service. It is also reijuired 
that information be given in advance as to the names of the lecturers 
and the subjects of the proposed lectures. It has been found neces- 
sary to refuse to permit the removal of the lantern from the Museum 
building. 

The rei)ort of the acting chief clerk is accomiianied by a statement 
of the proceedings of Congress during the fiscal year, so far as they 
concern the Smithsonian Institution and its bureaus. 

The report of the pr(q)erty clerk, Mr. J. S. Goldsmith, includes a 
number of detailed statements showing the work performed during 
the year, the amount of supplies of various kinds purchased, and the 
amount on hand June 30, 1897. More than 1,000 invoices of supplies 
were examined, transferred to official forms, and certified for settle- 
ment. One thousand six hundred and thirteen inside recpusitions for 
general supplies, and 1,.">05 recpiisitious for stationery were filled j also 
71 requisitions for cases, etc.

82 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

CORRESPONDENCE AND REPORTS. 

There has been a large increase of work in this division, which 
remains uuder the charge of Mr. R. I. Geare. This is doubtless due 
to the now well-established policy of the Museum with regard to sup- 
plyiug technical information to all applicants. There has also been 
general evidence of increased interest in the publications of the 
Museum, and this has resulted in a much larger distribution of them 
than in any previous year. 

During the year more than 15,000 official letters aud other papers 
have been prepared, and in addition nearly 30,000 volumes and pam- 
phlets have been sent, free of charge, to applicants for special publica- 
tions and to the libraries and individuals on the regular mailing lists. 
The number of individuals making special application for some Museum 
work is not less than 6,000, aud it may be added that, whenever prac- 
ticable, their requests have been complied with. 

The Annual Report for 1894, Volume XVIII of the Proceedings, 
Bulletins 47 and 49, and Special Bulletins 2 and 3 have been distributed 
to the institutions on the regular mailing lists of the Museum, as have 
also the separate papers issued from time to time during the year. 

In addition to the letters addressed to the Museum, there are received 
from the parent Institution not less than 4,000 letters a year, asking 
not only for publications, but for technical information, which can be 
supplied only by reference of these letters to members of the Museum 
scientific force. 

The detail, in February, of Mr, J. L. Willige, of this office, to act as 
chief clerk of the Museum, while undoubtedly serving the best interests 
of the Museum, was a serious loss to this division, and as no substitute 
has yet been appointed, his work is kept up only by the strenuous 
efforts of others in the office, among whom it has been subdivided, in 
addition to their regular duties. In other respects the force of the 
office has remained practically the same as last year. 

The manuscript and illustrations of the Report for 1895 were com- 
pleted early in the fiscal year, and during the fall the proof of the 
administrative portion of the Report was received aud read. In Feb- 
ruary the general editorial supervision of the papers in the appendix 
to the Report was j)laced in charge of the editor of the Proceedings 
and Bulletins. Owing to pressure of other matters in the editor's 
office, however, it became necessary to detail a clerk from this division 
for several weeks, to assist in editing the papers aud in xi roof-reading. 
The administrative part of the Annual Report for 1896 has been pre- 
pared in this office, as well as that part of the Secretary's report to the 
Board of Regents, which relates to the affairs of the National Museum. 

Considerable time was spent toward the close of the fiscal year in 
cataloguing, in convenient form for reference, the applications for 
specimens received during the past twenty or twenty-five years from 
educational institutions. 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 83 

Maiinscript was prepared for a pamphlet giving a general descrip- 
tion of the exhibits sent by the Museum to the Tennessee Centennial 
Exposition. 

A statement was prepared of the most important Government explo- 
rations which resulted in tlio acquisition of natural history or ethno- 
logical material by the Institution or the National Museum. 

A beginning was made toward the compilation of statistics showing 
the size, value of collections, etc., of the principal museums in this 
country and abroad. 

REGISTRATION AND DISTRIBUTION. 

During the year 42,583 packages of all kinds were received. Of this 
number, Gil packages contained specimens for the Museum collections, 
1,288 contained supplies of various kinds for the offices and shops, and 
about 28,000 consisted of publications. There was an increase of more 
than 17,000 in the total number of incoming packages, about 60 per 
cent of tliis increase being due to the unusually large number of publi- 
cations received. The total number of boxes and packages sent out 
was 3,332, of which 367 consisted of material shipped to the Tennessee 
Centennial Exposition. 

The eihtries on the incoming transportation record numbered 3,242, 
and on the outgoing transportation record 1,613. 

There M'cre 1,407 regular accessions, while 710 lots of material were 
received for identification. 

One hundred and ninety packages Mere placed in storage and 761 
were withdrawn. 

The number of specimens distributed during the year was 26,712, of 
which number 3,342 consisted of material lent for study. j\Iore than 
12,000 herbarium specimens were sent out in exchange, and many 
sets of marine invertebrates and geological specimens were distributed 
to educational institutions. 

A detailed statement, arranged geographically, showing to what 
institutions and individuals specimens have been sent during the year, 
is i)rinted as Appendix IX. The following statement, arranged geo- 
graphically, shows the number of lots of si)ecimens sent out:

BUILDINGS AND SUPERINTENDENCE. 

Mr. Henry Horan, who had been connected with the Smithsonian 
Institution and the National Museum for many years, and who since 
1880 had held the position of superintendent of buildings, died on 
September 29, 1896. On October 20 a new division was organized — 
that of buildings and superintendence — with Mr. J. Elfreth Watkins as 
chief. The following subdivisions are included: Oases and fixtures, 
J. S. Goldsmith, i^roperty clerk, in charge; buildings, watch-service, 
mechanics and labor, 0. A. Steuart, general foreman; heating, lighting, 
and electrical service, J. H. Parkhurst, engineer. 

Much-needed repairs and improvements have been made on both the 
Smithsonian and the Museum buildings, although on account of lack of 
funds it was necessary to restrict operations in this respect to such 
changes as were absolutely essential. 

During the winter and spring the attention of the office was taken 
up to a considerable extent with matters connected with the erection 
of galleries in the Museum building. The contract for the ironwork 
was awarded February 24, at a cost of $3,200, the work to be completed 
in sixty days. The contract for the stairs and balustrades was awarded 
on May 13, at a cost of $1,780, and that for the fireproof arching and 
floors on June 29, at a cost of $2,214, 



REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 85 

On December 10, 189(), it was possible, for the first time in the 
liistory of the Museum, to open all the courts of the builtliuii' to the 
public. 

The watchmen have been trained in the use of the fire extinguishers, 
and regular fire drills were held. One of the watchmen rendered efti- 
cient assistance at a fire in the storage rooms on Ninth street, and as 
a result much valuable property was saved. Tlie watchmen were also 
trained in the use of the telephone exchange board. There were more 
than l'S,0(>0 telephone calls during the year. 

The Smithsonian and Museum buildings were illuminated on the 
evening of March 4, the date of the inauguration of President 
Mc Kin ley. 

Tln-ee hundred and ninety requisitions relating to repairs to build- 
ings have been attended to by the general foreman; 274 for making 
and repairing cases have been looked after by the property clerk, aud 
54 have been attended to by the engineer. 

The rei)ort submitted by the chief of the division includes detailed 
statements showing the number of requisitions received from each of 
the departments of tlse Museum, the amount of fuel, gas, and ice con- 
sumed, the temperature iu the halls of the Museum during each day 
of the winter months, the supplies purchased for the use of the divi- 
sion, and an itemized list of the requisitions completed. The last- 
mentioned statement shows that 41 cases were constructed, 2G altered 
or remodeled, 38 repaired, 01 painted, and 49 glazed. There were 072 
unit drawers made and 1,043 repaired or fitted to cases.

TAXIDEKMISTS. 

Mr. William Palmer, chief taxidermist, reports that 65 mammals 
were i-eceived and skinned during the year. About one- half of these 
came from the National Zoological Park, as shown in the following table :

About three months were spent on work for the Tennessee Cen- 
tennial Exposition. For this purpose four specimens of lemurs were 
mounted and eighteen other specimens cleaned and i^acked; a cast of 
a large Galapagos tortoise was made and painted ; three casts of ceta- 
ceans were made; a cast of the head of a large turtle was cleaned and 
placed on a new shield; a model of the National Zoological Park was 
finished and packed; a groui) of monkeys and another of gibbons was 
renovated and put into condition for exhibition, and models of a giant 
squid and an octopus received similar attention. Mr. Palmer devoted 
three weeks' time to the work of setting up this and other exhibits at 
the Exposition. 

About 200 pair of elk, caribou, and moose antlers, which have been 
accumulating in the Museum for mauj^ years, were turned over to the 
taxidermist for attention. It was decided to select a series to mount 
ut)on shields for decorating the piers of the mammal hall. Those hav- 
ing skulls were cleaned and bleached. The bases of the others were 
built up and covered with brown velvet. Twenty-seven sets were thus 
prepared and hung on piers. 

Other work has been attended to as follows : Four mounted heads of

American bison were repaired, poisoned, placed on new shields, and 
installed in the department of mammals; six monnted heads of mam- 
mals were overhauled and boxed for shipment; a number of casts of 
an Assyrian cylinder seal were made; several mounted heads on the 
south wall of the exhibition hall devoted to the department of mammals 
were taken down, cleaned, and rehung.

In the department of birds the work of the preceding years — that of 
renovating the entire series of mounted birds — was continued. A 
number of specimens received in the tlesh were cleaned and prepared, 
other skins were poisoned, and a few improperly made specimens were 
remade. A limited number of mounted specimens were transferred to 
modern stands and a few mounted specimens were made up for the 
study series. The Museum specimen of the extinct Philips Island 
parrot was remounted. A series of 49 specimens of birds from British 
Guiana and about 35 parrots were mounted for the Tennessee Centen- 
nial Exposition. A group of 3 Argus pheasants was mounted and 
nearly completed. 

OSTEOLOGISTS. 

Considerable time has been spent in cleaning fishes and the contents 
of the stomachs of seals, the synoptic series has received attention, and 
a number of casts of brains have been made. Many vertebrate fossils 
have been mounted and repaired. Material was prepared, mounted, 
and boxed for the Tennessee Centennial Exposition. 

The work of laying a new floor in the exhibition ball of the depart- 
ment of comparative anatomy necessitated a largo amount of extra labor 
in removing the specimens, placing some of the material in storage, and 
finally in cleaning and preparing the specimens for exhibition after the 
work on the floor had been finished. 

A summary of the osteological work during the year is i)resented in 
the following statement:

A revision of the nomenclature of 

the Brachyura. 

Proe. Biol. Soc. Wash., xi, June 9, 1897, 
pp. 153-167. 
This revision is made in accordance with the 
code of the American Ornithologists' Union. 
The changes which it is found necessary to 
make are discussed under the following head- 
ings : (1) Names diverted from their original 
meaning; (2) The name of a composite genus 
tenable for one or more of its species which do 
not belong in older genera; (3) The name of a 
composite genus, when made up wholly of older 
genera, tenable for a component part requiring 
a name; (4) Specification of type; (5) Earlier 
nanu's neglected ; (6) Names based on figures 
without description; (7) Post-Linna'an name 
given by a polynomialist invalid ; (8) I'reoc- 
cupiednames; (9) Names given simultaneously 
to different genera; (10) Original orthography 
to be preserved except in case of typographical 
error. 

Twenty-six new generic names are proposed 
for old names which have been used in viola- 
tion of accepted rules.

applied to the Texan Cardinal, the true P. sin- 
uata being a.scertained to occur in Arizona and 
western Mexico. The name P. sinuata beck- 
hami, erroneously bestowed on the latter, thus 
becomes a synonjm. 

Dendroica crerulea vs. Dendroica vara. 

Auk, XIV, No. 1, Jan., 1897, p. 97. 
Sylvia ccerulea of Wilson is found to be an-

tating the adoption of the subsequent Sylvia 
mra "Wilson for the Cerulean Warbler, whose 
name thus becomes Dendroica vara (Wilson).

The Swastika, the earliest known 

symbol, and its migrations; with ob- 
servations on the migrations of certain 
industries in prehistoric times. 

Rep. Smithsonian Inst. (TJ. S. Nat. 

Mus.), 1894 (1897), pp. 757-1011, pis. 1-25, 

flgs. 1-374. 
The use, if not the origin, of the Swastika 
sign can be traced to prehistoric times, espe- 
cially in the Bronze Age in Asia and through- 
out Europe. It is not found in Babylon, As- 
syria, Chaldea or Egypt. It ajipeared in pre- 
historic times among North American savages 
and in Central and South America, and is con- 
tinued in the eastern regions of the Orient 
in modern times. It is used among the 
Buddhists as a holy sign, but is believed to 
have been generally a sign of good luck, hap- 
piness, long life. The question of its migra- 
tion is argued, and signs and industries of the 
different countries are compared.

RECENT FORAMIXIFERA. A DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE OF 
SPECIMENS DREDGED RY THE U. S. FISH COM-

PREFACE. 



The purpose of this catalogue is to record tlie results of an examina- 
tiou of a portion of the bottom material obtained duriug the dredgiug 
operations of the U. S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross, and at the 
same time to furnish a convenient book of reference for those who are, 
or may become, sufficiently interested to continue the study of this 
material. 

The examination, while very far from exhaustive, has been pursued 
with greater or less diligence, as time and opportunity offered, for sev- 
eral years. Material from about one hundred and tweuty-tive stations 
has been carefully studied, and specimens from more than a hundred 
localities have been preserved and identified. Of these localities, 
fifty-eight are in the Korth Atlantic Ocean, twenty one in the Gulf of 
Mexico, seven in the Caribbean Sea, one in the South Pacific, and 
five in the North Pacific. The depths at these stations vary from 7 to 
l.',51- fathoms. 

The figures in illustration are from photograj^hs of mounted speci- 
mens on exhibition in the U. S. National Museum, Division of Marine 
Invertebrates. A uniform enlargement of about 15 diameters has 
been maintained in the figures, sometimes at a sacrifice of detail in 
the smaller specimens which would have been made clearer by the use 
of a higher magnifying power, but for the j)urpose of identification it 
is believed to be more useful to mark distinctly the relative size of the 
objects. The exhibition series has been mounted expressly for public 
dis])lay. The individuals of each species are attached in various atti- 
tudes to the bottom of the shallow cavity of a concave, blackened disk 
ot brass. For security each disk is provided with a removable fenes- 
trated brass cap having a top of thin glass. These disks are arranged 
in concentric rows upon a large circular metal plate which occupies 
the place of the stage of an ordinary microscope. The circular plate 
IS given both a rotary and a toand-fro movement by means of a fric-

tion roller and a rack aud piuion, so that all the mounts may be suc- 
cessively brought under the microscope. The specimens thus arranged 
are inclDsed in a box having a glass top, through which the objective 
of a microscope projects.' 

In the following catalogue the classification of Mr. n. B. Brady has 
been followed, as presented in "The report on the Foraminifera col- 
lected by H. M. S. Cliallenf/er,^^ and his definitions of families and 
genera have been appropriated bodily. The analytical table is also 
compiled chiefly from the above-mentioned report. The descriptions 
ol species have been prepared after study of the reserve series as well 
as of the typical specimens reproduced in the illustrations. 

The localities given are only those from which specimens have been 
taken in selecting the series exhibited and in reserve, and do not 
profess to represent the distribution of the species. 

A supplementary table gives the latitude, longitude, and depth of 
water of the stations referred to in the catalogue. 

THE FORAMINIFERA. 

The Foraminifera are minute aquatic, mostly marine, animals, having 
semifluid bodies, composed of granular protoplasm, inclosed in shells 
or "tests" either secreted by the animal or built up of available foreign 
material, such as mud, sand, sponge si)icules,or dead shells. In zoologi- 
cal classification they belong to the Khizopod group of the Protozoa, 
and are distinguished from other members of the group by the single 
character of the reticulated form assumed by their pseudopodia when 
extended. 

These minute animals are interesting objects of study, geologically 
and biologically as well as esthetically. As objects of beauty they 
arrest the attention of even the casual observer by the delicacy of 
their structure as well as the symmetry and variety of their forms. 
Geologically they are of interest because they are among the most 
ancient aud abundant of fossils and also the most efticient of rock 
builders. Biologically they are instructive examples of the powers and 
possibilities of an individualized bit of protoplasm — "a little particle 
of apparently homogeneous jelly, changing itself into a greater variety 
of forms than the fabled Proteus, laying hold of its food without mem- 
bers, swallowing it without a mouth, digesting it without a stomach, 
appropriating its nutritious material without absorbent vessels or a 
circulating system, moving from place to place without muscles, feeling 
(if it has any power to do so) without nerves, propagating itself without 
genital apparatus, aud not only this, but forming shelly coverings of a 

' This apparatus was devised by the writer and put on exhibition in the year 1890. 
It has been subjected to the very severe test of years of use by the general public, 
children as well as adults, to the number of hundreds each day, and this with only 
the occasional presence of an attendant in the room. See Eeport U. S. Nat. Mus., 
1896, p. 96.)

syiiiiuetry and complexity not surpassed by those of any testaceous 
animals.'" 

From the resemblance of some of the shells of the foramiuifera to 
those of the nautilus, they were for a long- time regarded as minute 
cei^halopod mollusks; that is, aniong the highest of the invertebrates, 
and it was not until the year 1835 that their true nature was discovered 
and announced by M. Dujardiu to the French Academy of Sciences. 
Since that time the study of this order of animals has been pursued by 
able naturalists, and the results of their investigations appear in a 
voluminous literature. Much yet remains to be learned of the life his- 
tory of the animal, but its zoological position is established and its 
importance in the economy of nature recognized. 

As fossils the foramiuifera are common in all geological systems from 
the Devonian upward, but they are especially abundant in Mesozoic and 
Cenozoic time. The chalk and many of the most extensive limestone 
beds are formed principally of their remains. As to i)resent habitat, 
their shells are found wherever dredgings are made, all over the ocean 
tloor except in the polar regions. A few species are "pelagic;" that is, 
they are found living at or near the surface of the water, but the weight 
of evidence is in favor of the conclusion that the vast majority of them 
pass all stages of life at the bottom, where they are found. In the 
experience of the naturalists of the Albatross it was rare to find any 
but the most minute and thin-shelled forms in the surface dredgings, 
and still more rare for any to be taken in the "wing nets" that were 
usually attached to the dredging apparatus. 

The living foraminifer is a minute bit of viscid, granular protoplasm, 
without organs or tissues, without differentiation of substance into outer 
membrane and inner contents, and in most instances without evident 
nucleus or contractile vesicle. A nucleus has been recognized in a few 
individuals, and hence this characteristic element of most living cells 
is inferred to be present in all the members of the order. Like other 
Rhizopods, it has the power to protrude any parts of its body as "pseu- 
dopodia,"' for the purpose of locomotion or the prehension and absorption 
of food. It differs, however, from the other Khizopods in that the 
pseudoi^odia do not necessarily remain distinct, but flow together when- 
ever they touch one another, forming sometimes an elaborate and 
extended network of protoplasmic threads, which, however, may be 
readily retracted and flow again into the body mass, leaving no indica- 
tion of their previous existence. 

How the function of nutrition is accomplished and the nature and 
condition of the organic material used as food by these minute animals 
is not yet determined. Without doubt the pseudopodia are capable of 
seizing and inclosing small organic particles with which they may come 
in contact, and any part of the protoplasmic body, of which the pseudo- 
potliaare but temporary extensions, is able to digest and assimilate the

254 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

nutritive i)ortion. To further account for the necessary food supply, it 
is believed that the Foramiuifera absorb organic matter hekl in solu- 
tion by the sea water. This theory is tlie more easily accepted since 
we know that they have the power to separate inorganic matter (car- 
bonate of lime in particular) iroin its solution, with which to construct, 
wholly or in part, their shells. 

Of the process of reproduction little is known beyond the fact of 
multiplication by gemmation and fission. Every part of this simple 
animal being sufticientunto itself for purposes of nutrition and growth, 
it follows that a fragment of the protoplasmic body cast oft' from the 
parent becomes at once a new individual and the possible founder of a 
fresh colony. But it is not in accord with what we know of the lite 
histories of other living things that this i)rocess of subdivision or prop- 
agation by cuttings or shoots can go on indefinitely. It is more likely 
that some kind of sexual reproduction takes place, the manner of which 
is yet to be demonstrated. 

The most striking characteristic'of this simple, semifluid animal, of 
indefinite and changeable shape, is its ability to construct a shell or 
test of definite form in which to shelter itself. This shell or test may 
be irregular, simple, and rude in construction, or symmetrical and of 
great delicacy and beauty, in variety of forms rivaling the shells of the 
Mollusca, of which it was long thought to be a diminutive example. 

Structurally there are three quite definite- and distinct types of tes- 
taceous covering. The first, to begin with the lowest and least common, 
is the "chitinous" test — a thin, transparent, yellowish or brownish 
membranous investment secreted by the animal. It has one or more 
general apertures, but is not perforated with fine foramina, and there 
is no means of communication between the inside and outside of the 
test except by the general apertures. The foraminifera with this kind 
of shell have been grouped in the single family of Gromidce. As a rule 
they inhabit only fresh or brackish water. They have not been found 
in deep-water marine collections, and do not appear in the following 
catalogue. 

The second type is the so-called "arenaceous" test. This is an 
investment constructed of grains of sand, or of the dead shells of other 
foraminifera, or of sponge spicules, or even of mud, cemented together 
more or less firmly by means of a calcareous cement secreted by the 
animal. Usually it has one or more general apertures of comparatively 
Ifirge size, and in addition there may be minute orifices between the 
sand grains, or other substances of which the test is constructed, 
through which the delicate threads of protoplasm can be i)rojected. 
The surfaces may be rough and coarse or smooth and highly finished, 
according to the fineness of the material used and the amount of cement 
deposited in the crevices and angles between the grains. When con- 
structed of mud these tests are fountl, in some instances, to have a 
chitinous base, which maintains the shape of the investment. 



DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE OF RECENT FORAMINIFERA. 255 

The third type of structure is a true shell, composed almost entirely 
of ciirbouates of lime and magnesia separated by the animal from their 
solution in the sea water, and fixed in solid form. It is through the 
agency of the forainiuifera i)rincipally that the limestone, which is con- 
stantly being dissolved by rains and carried by rivers to the sea, is 
restored to the solid crust of the earth. Of these ''calcareous" shells 
there are two kinds, quite distinct in appearance, known as "porcel- 
lanous" and "hyaline." The former are usually white, opaque, shining 
with the peculiar luster of porcelain, and "imperforate;" the latter are 
transparent, glassy, and "perforate," more or less densely, by minute, 
parallel, unbranclied tubes for the passage of delicate pseudopodia. In 
both kinds there are usually one or more comparatively large, general 
ai)ertures. Surface marking, or "ornamentation," is common in both 
the porcellanous and hyaline shells. In tlie former they take the form 
of striations or plttings, more or less regular and conspicuous; in the 
latter, of ridges, tubercles, or s])ines, of clear nontubular shell-substance, 
varying constantly in number and prominence among individuals of the 
same species. 

Architecturally the first and most obvious division of these shells is 
into single-chambered (monothalamous, or unilocular) and many-cham- 
bered (polytbalamous, or multilocular). While the primitive form of 
both the single and many chambered shells is evidently globular, yet 
the possibilities of ultimate conformation, depending chiefiy upon direc- 
tion of growth, are very great. Thus a monothalamous shell, beginning 
as an incomplete spherical chamber, may become ovate, fiask-shaped, 
spindle shaped, star shaped, or tubular, and the tubular form may be 
straight, curved, coiled, or quite irregular. And these forms pass from 
one into another by quite insensible degrees. The polythalamous shell 
is a consequence of the process of reproduction by "gemmation," as 
the other is of reproduction by "fission." In this case the growing 
sarcode pushes outside the initial chamber until at a certain stage it 
builds a new wall around itself, while still maintaining connection with 
the parent cell. This second segment may give origin to a third, and 
so on until a colony is established, each offspring occupying an apart- 
ment added to the parental home. It is easy to see that the style of 
architecture of these tenements nmy be almost infinitely varied by vary- 
ing the shape and position of these annexes. Each annex may have 
any of the forms of the monothalamous shells or any modification of 
them, and the arrangement may be in straight or curved lines, in con- 
centric cii'cles or planospiral coils, in single or double series spirally 
coiled, in two or three alternating series not spiral, or even in an irreg- 
ular and disorderly mass. 

Usually in the development of the polythalamous shell each succes- 
sive segment uses the party walls of the preceding segments, so far as 
they may be available, in the construction of its own annex, but in 
some of the higher types of the hyaline series it will be found that 



256 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

each chamber has a complete wall of its own, thus making double par- 
titions between them. In some of these higher types there is devel- 
oijed also what is called a "supplemental skeleton," which consists of 
a deposit of shell-substance on the outside of the original wall, thereby 
adding to its thickness, filling in the hollows between the segments and 
at the umbilici, and sometimes growing out into protuberances of 
various shapes. This supplemental skeleton is generally traversed by 
a set of canals or sinuses — passages left during the deposit of the 
shell-substance, and probably occupied by threads of sarcode during 
the life of the animal. 

The separation into families, genera, and species of a group of ani- 
mals like the foraminifera, where variation is the rule and passage from 
one type to another is by a sliding scale and not even by a series of 
steps, is extremely difficult, and must always remain unsatisfactory in 
some particulars; but for convenience of reference, if for no other 
reason, a classification of some sort is demanded, and various schemes, 
which it is unnecessary here to enumerate, have been put forth to bridge 
the difficulty. In all these schemes the primary divisions" are founded 
upon the structure of the test as above described — that is, whether 
chitinous, arenaceous, or calcareous, and whether perforate or imperfo- 
rate. Beyond these distinctions, which seem to have a physiological 
foundation, there is nothing upon which to base a classification but the 
form of the test, which, as we have seen, is never determinate enough 
to permit of the establishment of fixed boundary lines. Generic and 
specific names of foraminifera, therefore, must not be considered as 
having much zoological value, but only as convenient titles applied to 
certain typical forms around which many varieties may be grouped. 
And it must be remembered that, however elastic the definitions of 
species, or even genera, there will often be a margin of doubt, and 
the determination of j)lace in th« classification must be left to the 
preference of the individual observer. 

A few words concerning the manipulation of material and specimens 
may be of assistance to those beginning the study of the foraminifera. 

Collection of recent shallow- water forms may be made from shore 
sands, from the anchor and chains, and especially from the " chain 
lockers " of ships, from sponge sand, and by means of boat dredges from 
the shallow waters of the coast. Deep-water forms are only obtainable 
by special apparatus, such as is used in deep sea sounding or in purely 
scientific explorations of the ocean bed. The specimens may be freed 
from mud by the j^rocess of decantation — that is, repeatedly agitating 
in water, and, after a very brief period to allow subsidence of the shells, 
pouring off the turbid surface water. Or the material maybe put in a 
bag made of fine bolting cloth and the bag shaken in a bucket of water. 
The remaining foraminifera, mixed Avith more or less sand, pteropod 
shells, sponge spicules, and debris of various sorts, should then be 
thoroughly dried, bottled, and labeled. 

For examination of the dried material a dissecting microscope stand,

with a i>ood acroinatic leus magiiityiug about 10 diauieteis, is most 
convenient. A small (jninitity ottlie nuiterial in a shallow wateli f^lass 
blaekened on the under siile, being placed under the lens, is carefully 
inspected, and when a specimen is found which it is desired to i^re- 
serve it may be readily removed by means of a very line camel's hair 
pencil slightly moistened between the lips. Transfer of si)ecimens 
should l)e attemitted with the moistened pencil only, as the use of forceps 
is certain to crush the delicate shells. 

For preservation of the identified specimens in numbers for study 
nothing is better than wooden slides of regulation size — 1 by ."> inches. 
The.>e may have either a concavity drilled in one side nearly through 
the wood and painted black, or a hole bored entirely through the slide 
and one side covered with heavy blackened paper. A rem(»val)le cover 
to this little cavity nuiy be cut Ironi a thin sheet of mica and held in 
place either by a spring clamp or by slipping it under the thin ]»aper 
front of the slide, which is left unglued about the center for that 
pnrj)ose. 

To make a section the si)ecimen should be attacrhed in the desired 
attitude to the face and near the end of a glass slip by means of the 
minutest drop of liquid glue. The attitude of the specimen must be 
carefully i)ieserved until the glue has set. The shell is then covered 
with chloroform or xylol balsam, which may be made to penetrate the 
chambers of the shell and be rapidly hardened by the application of 
direct heat up to the boiling tem})eratnre. Superfluous balsam being- 
cut away, the shell supported by the balsam is rubbed lightly upon a 
hone, kept thoroughly wet with water, until the desired section is 
exposed. The balsam is then dissolved away by chloioform, and the 
glue by water, and the specimen mounte<l. 

The manner in which specimens shall be mounted will depend upon 
the preferences or ingenuity of the preparator, and the arrangements he 
may make for the storage of his collection. If a cover-glass is used it 
should not be .sealed on, as the underside of the glass is almost certain 
to "sweat" sooner or later, and obscure the specimen. It may be w(n-th 
while to say that for the attachment of the shells to any surfa(;e the 
author has not found anything better than microscopists' gold size. 
The best instrument for transferring the minute droj) of adhesive 
material of whatever kind to the point where the shell is to be attached 
is the finest obtaiiuible sewing needle, the eye end inserted in a slender 
handle and the point broken off at the thickest part of the needle. 

The literature of the subject is very large, though most of it is to be 
found in journals of natural history and transactions of societies. With 
Carpenter's "Introduction to the Study of the Foraminifera,'' Brady's 
''lieport on the Forannnifera collected by H. M. S. Challeuf/er,''^ and 
Sherborn's ''Index to theClenera and Si)ecies of the Foraminifera," the 
student will be able to begin work in an intelligent manner and to find 
references to all that has been published on this subject up to the most 
recent date.

(Plate .39, fi^. 2.) 

A stout, inflated, smooth, and polished shell, slightly compressed 
from above downward, nearly circular in outliue when seen from above, 
the final segment projecting well beyond the preceding one, to which it 
is smoothly and firmly joined; aperture usually a broad slit with a 
nearly ecpially broad valvular lower lip. Diameter, 1.5 mm. (iV inch), 
more or less. Longitudinal section shows arrangement of chambers 
characteristic of the genus, and the apertures alternately at opposite 
ends of the shell. 

Localities. — Off Cape Hatteras and in the Gulf of Mexico (stations 
2115, 2352, 2385), 4G0 to 840 fathoms. 

BILOCULINA COMATA Brady. 
(Plate 39, tig. 3.) 

Subglobular in form, otherwise like B. ringens ; characterized specific- 
ally by surface ornamentation consisting of more or less conspicuous, 
fine, straight, parallel stria^. covering the whole shell; aperture an 
arched slit, with a broad, thick valvular lower lip. 

Locality. — West coast of Cuba (station 2352), 463 fathoms. 

BILOCULINA ELONGATA d'Orbigny.

BILOCULINA DEHISCENS, new species. 
(Plate 40. fig. 3.) 

This species has the same general characters as i>. depressa and its 
variety serrata, but the last two chambers are more or less separated at 
the sides, giving the shell the appearance of rupture from internal 
growth and distension. In general the separation is sufficient to show 
the sharp edge of the third segment on each side, but series presenting 
all degrees of gradation from Biloculina to Spiroloculina have been 
selected from material dredged at a single station.

BILOCULINA IRREGULARIS d'Orbigny. 

(P]ate41, fig. 3.) 

Differs from other species of this genus in tliat it is compressed at 
the sides instead of from above downward. Seen from above the con- 
tour is oval; from the side the outline is broader, ai^proaching the 
circular when the compression is considerable. Ai^erture circular or 
broad, with a valvular lip in the somewhat protuberant oral end.

(Plat(i 42, (ig. 1.) 

Much compressed laterally, broad oval to nearly round, more or less 
concave on both sides; extremities angular or pointed ; periphery 
rounded, Avith sharp, projecting* marginal angles, which are often 
toothed. Four to six segments visible on both sides, outlined by the 
acute prominent marginal angles; aperture round, witli a T-shaped val- 
vular tooth in the i)rotruding- end of the final segment. Longitudinal

SPIROLOCULINA ROBUSTA, series. 
(Plate 42, fig. 2.) 

This is a series, selected from material dredged at a single station, to 
show an apparent evolution of ISpirolocuUna robusta from BilocuUna 
depressa. The specimens are shown in i)airs, the first of the pair being 
a whole shell resting upon its side, the other being a transverse section 
of a similar shell standing on end. The few specimens exhibited show 
a passage from one form to the other by well-defined steps, but with a 
large number of specimens the gradation is so easy that it becomes 
indefinable. The series illustrates the difficulties of classification in 
this order of animals.

300 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

MILIOLINA UNDOSA Karrer. 

(Plate 45, fig. 4.) 

In this species of Miliolina the exposed portions of the segments are 
angular instead of being rounded or having a single sharp margin. 
Moreover, the angles of the segments are wavy, giving a crumpled

A single specimen of this species has been found. It has much the 
appearance of two small Miliolina linnmana grown together at the side, 
but the smaller portion has no neck or external operture, and the form 
is undoubtedly due to the irregular growth of the later segments.

This species includes a wide variety of forms liresenting all tlie inter- 
mediate stages from thick, slightly compressed, naiitiloid shells, to the 
long, cylindrical, crosier- shaped varieties, and from these to the thin, 
compressed, rapidly widening forms. In all varieties the chambers

the surface, with few exceptions, is striate. 

Localities. — Straits of Yucatan and Exuma Sounds (stations 2352, 
2629), 4G3 and 1,169 fathoms. 

PENEROPLIS PERTUSUS, variety DISCOIDEUS, new, 
(Plato 49, fig. 1.) 

In this variety the final chambers completely surround the primary 
convolutions, forming a circular, thin disk resembling the discoidal 
forms of Orbulina, but distinguished by the entire absence of septa in 
the individual chambers. 

Locality. — Key West Harbor; shallow water. 

Genus ORBICULINA. 

Chambers subdivided by transverse secondary septa; early segments 
embracing; arrangement either planospiral throughout or partly cycli- 
cal; contour nautiloid, auricular, crosier-shaped, or complanate.

The only species of the genus. A planospiral, porcellanous, imper- 
forate, polished shell, varying in contour from crosier-shaped to dis- 
coidal; surface usually jntted with minute depressions; the early 
convolutions embracing; chambers narrow and regularly subdivided ; 
apertures a series of pores in two or more rows on the outer edge of

spicuous, globular; second chamber nearly surrounds the first; succeed- 
ing segments rapidly lengthen and quickly become annular. Cham- 
bers divided by septa into chamberlets, arranged in a double tier, with 
free communication. Peripheral orifices in two rows, corresponding to 
the double tier of chamberlets. This latter feature together with the 
early annular segments, distinguish this species from others of the 
genus. Diameter, 1 to 2.5 mm. (3-5 to j-Q-inch).

disk with flat surfaces. In the arrangement of the chambers it com- 
mences as a convoluted, planospiral, nonseptate tube; it continues with 
a short series of spiral chambers and ends with a broad series of annu- 
lar chambers. The spiral and annular chambers are partially divided, 
by partitions projecting from the inner walls, into numerous chamber- 
lets. The chamberlets of each aunulus communicate not only with 
each other but also with those of the succeeding annulus. A single 
row of i)ores opens on the margin of the final chamber. Diameter, from 
1 to 20 mm. (./§ to | inch). The shaded portions in the figure are those 
parts of the specimen still occupied by the protoplasmic substance of

NOTE. 

The lirst studies for the followiug paper on " Pipes and Smoking Cus- 
toms of the American Aborigines'' were made from the ricb collections 
in the U. S. National Museum, but as the material grew it was sug- 
gested by Dr. G. Brown (loode, assistant secretary of the Smithsonian 
Institution, that it would be well to carefully consider the pipes con- 
tained in other public museums and in private collections. Acting on 
this suggestion, an extensive correspondence ensued with many persons 
interested in the subject, and, as will be observed, the work has been 
greatly fa(;ilitated by their courteous assistance. The writer now desires 
to express his grateful acknowledgments and thanks for the aid 
afforded him by the loan of specimens, and when this was not possible, 
of tracings and photographs; also for the list of references suggested, 
and for the freedom allowed in examination of pipes on all occasions, 
and in data concerning localities and circumstances under which cer- 
tain objects were found. 

Among those persons whom the writer desires particularly to mention 
are Drs. William H. Holmes, Otis T. Mason, Thomas Wilson, and Walter 
Hough, of the U. S. National Museum; Maj. J. W. Powell, Mr. W J 
McGee, Dr. J.Walter Fewkes, Mr. F. W. Hodge, and Mr. James Mooney,

MEXICAN AND PUEBLO TUBULAR PIPES. 

The use of the tobacco plant for smoking- piiq^oses is undoubtedly of 
Ameiicau origin, and bas been common tbrongbout Korth America 
among- tbe Indians from a period long jirior to tiie arrival of the whites 
on the continent. Using the i^lant for snulliug, however, appears to 
have been a peculiarity of the Southern Continent, while of the habit 
of chewing- there seems to be but meager reference by early writers, 
consequently little is known of the extent to which the practice pre- 
vailed. The accounts of all early American voyagers, with scarcely an 
exception, who have come in first contact with the Indians have referred 
to the common emj)loyment of tobacco in all treaties, councils, and, in 
fact, fiinctionsof every kind, including social intercourse, in divination, 
and in the cure of disease. Other plants, however, have been used quite 
commonly for the same jDurpose from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic 
Ocean, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. There is no doubt that 
tobacco smoking in pipes such as we are now familiar with, as a habit 
or pastime, is an invention of the European. Smoke in some form has 
been emi^loyed in the treatment of disease from a time long prior to the 
Christian era; and the early Spanish, French, and English references to 
smoking all bear evidence that tobacco was considered a plant of won- 
derful properties. Herodotus says the Messagetae, a people of Asia 
Minor, supposed to be Scythians, in battle with whom Cyrus was killed 
about 529 B. C, are reported "to have discovered trees that produce 
fruit of a peculiar kind, which the inhabitants, when they meet together 
in companies and have lit a fire, throw on a fire, as they sit in a circle; 
and that bj" inhaling the fumes of the burning- fruit that has been 
thrown on, they become intoxicated by the odor just as the Greeks do 
by wine; and that the more fruit that is thrown on, the more intoxi- 
cated they become, until they rise up to dance and betake themselves 
to singing."^ 

' Herodotus, Book I, p. 88, translated by Henry Gary, New York, 1855. 

361 



3n2 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

Many of the early Americau peoples, iucluding the Aztecs, are de- 
scribed as inhaling smoke for the purj)oseof intoxicating themselves— a 
practice yet indulged in at various i)laces. Herodotus also says " that 
when a man attains great age all his kinsmen meet and sacrifice him," 
and "that they worship the sun of all the gods." ' 

These rites of the Messagetae are similar to the practices of certain 
American Indians. That similar conditions naturally engender like 
practices among races in a primitive stage of development has been 
observed all over the world. This is noticeable in the primitive tools of 
all ancient races, there being scarcely an exception to the rule. Accord- 
ing to Strabo, the Mysians were eaters of smoke — " Krapnobates." ' 

This reference, however, is rather a suggestion found in a note of the 
French translation of Strabo than of Strabo himself, who really says 
" Posidonius relates that the Mysians religiously abstain from eating 
anything that had life, and consequently from cattle, wherefore they 
are considered a religious people and called Capnobatae.*' ' Plutarch 
says in De Fluvius, " in Thrace near the Hebrus there grows a plant 
which resembles the origanum [wild marjoram] ; the inhabitants of 
that country throw the leaves on a brazier and inhale the smoke, which 
intoxicates them." 

Pliny says, " Sandarach, taken in the form of a fumigation, also with 
cedar, has a remedial etfect."^ This plant is a medium-sized tree {Cal- 
litris quadrivalvis or Thuya articulata) of the pine family from Xorth 
Africa, and yields a resinous gum, which, when heated or siirinkled on 
burning coals, emits an agreeable balsamic odor and calls to mind the 
liquid amber used as a mixture with tobacco by the Aztecs. The 
Aztecs were described as burning incense and liquid amber and mix- 
ing sweet-smelling substances with burning herbs quite often whin 
reference to what we now denominate " smoking " was intended. Eefer- 
ence to the cedar being used in fumigation calls to mind that its bark 
is smoked at the present time by certain American tribes. 

Pliny further says that Ai)polodorus (a naturalist of the first century) 
mentions as a remarkable fact that the barbarians, " by inhaling the 
fumes of chameleuce [colts foot] at the mouth thereby diminish the 
volume of the spleen."' The term "inhalation" suggests something 
more than a " fumigation," especially when the further recommenda- 
tion is made of employing the smoke of "dried cow dung" as being 
remarkably good for phthisis when inhaled through a reed,'' and "that 
chameleuce, having its root burnt upon cypress charcoal, the smoke ol 
which is good when inhaled by the aid of a funnel or reed." '

AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 308 

There is little room to doubt that the tube or funnel is an implement 
of great anti(|uity iu smoking elsewhere than on the American conti- 
nent. Implements figured as Roman pipes, so far as they have come 
under the writer's observation, appear to be modern and of the Eng- 
lish or French "trade" type. Other plants are so commonly used in 
the pipe by the Indians of the whole continent and have been so 
employed, according to early writers, for so long a jieriod as to indicate 
a very ancient usage. Although there are several native varieties of 
the family Ificotiana in America, it appears highly probable that the 
use of tobacco first became general through its cultivation by the 
Spanish and their trade in it with the natives. The Spanish early cul- 
tivated it, for next to food they would naturally grow those plants for 
which there was the greatest demand and the best market among the 
natives. It is a well-known fact that the English settlers in Virginia 
during the first half of the seventeenth century more than once brought 
themselves to the verge of starvation because of their having culti- 
vated tobac<!o to the exclusion of necessary vegetables. 

Throughout the seventeenth century, if not later, smoking was 
indulged iu by Europeans mainly because of the wonderful proper- 
ties attributed to tobacco. It was supposed not only to cure disease, 
but was considered a detergent as well. It was said to prevent the 
pangs of hunger and fatigue, and was long prescribed as a medicine by 
the physicians of Spain, France, and England. The visitation of the 
plague m Europe encouraged the use of tobacco enormously, as it was 
sui)posed that it would keep off the disease; and was so sought after and 
so generally prescribed that its use quickly became a confirmed habit 
among many persons, and the use of that which had been looked npon 
as a valued medicine became perverted into a vice difficult to eradicate. 
And as late as the time of Charles II, tobacco was supposed to be a 
mighty antidote to the plague, and it has been said that at a certain 
time during his reign the worst floggings the boys ever received at 
Eaton were because they refused to smoke. 

The employment of the words "funnel" and "reed" by Pliny may 
appear to be indefinite references to the pipe, but they are equally as 
distinct as are many of the early Spanish, French, and English expres- 
sions used in regard to it, even as late as the first half of the seven- 
teenth century, at which date the word "tobacco" had not yet come 
into general use. 

The most ancient, and at the same time the most reliable evidence of 
the early employment of the pipe on the American continent is the bas- 
relief of the Alta Casa or Adoratio, at the entrance of the temple of 
the Cross, one of the so-called palaces of Palenque, to which attention 
was called by John L. Stevens, it being deservedly considered one of 
the most remarkable as well as one of the best known of American 
antiquities.^ It is shown as the frontispiece.

364 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

This slab, or altar, as it has been called, is of artistic concept, design, 
and finish; it hiis been referred to as representing a ''Maya rain god, 
Tlaloc, blowing the winds from his mouth." He is figured "with the 
eagle in his headdress; the jaw with grinders; the j^eculiar eye; the 
snake between his legs, and a leopard skin over his back." This glyph 
represents the official, whether priest or other functionary, standing in 
an upright position, his arms extended, with the palms of the hands 
held together, forming a trough at a level with the mouth; lying in this 
trough of the hands is a tubular object, through which he appears to 
be blowing a visible something, as indicated by the ascending -and 
descending part of the glyph. The posture is such as may be seen 
to-day when the Moki priest thus holds the pipe at a ceremonial dance 
and blows the smoke to the four wiuds, as well as to the upper and the 
lower world. The implement upon the slab has the exact shape of the 
ceremonial pipe of the Moki, as represented by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes. 
This, moreover, appears to be the type of the most primitive pipe found 
in America, and the one which is distributed over a greater geograi)h- 
ical area than any other found on the continent, and is, in fact, the only 
type which appears common to the whole country. This opinion is 
sustained by the pipes found by arch.xjologic excavations in many 
States, which suggest the tube similar in shape to that pictured on the 
Palen(j[ue tablet as the most iirimitive pipe of which we have knowl- 
edge. "The leopard skin on the back, the beak and eyes of the bird 
on the headdress of Tlaloc," says Stevens, "was all a mystery, silent, 
defying the most scrutinizing gaze and reach of the intellect." 

The snake so prominent on this slab appears as a garment of snakes 
on the statue of the bloody Huitzilopotchli, the war god of the Mexi- 
cans, who is represented as holding in each of his claw-like hands a 
human heart. To find a snake carved u^wn the pipe is by no means an 
unusual feature, it being one of the most common totems of the North 
American Indian tribes. The bird, either a hawk or an eagle, on the 
Palenqne tablet represents, very likely, one of the totems. Paleuque 
is in the State of Chiapas, Mexico, in latitude 17° 30' north, longitude 
92° 26' west, and is suiiposed to have been in ruins before the invasion 
of Mexico by Cortez. The smoker, if such he be, on the slab, invests 
it with unusual interest, for in addition to its being of pre-Columbian 
origin, its location appears to be that of the extreme southern limit of 
the pipe in America, so far as we know from records or reliable antiqui- 
ties. 

While the writer is convinced that the tube is the primitive form of 
the pipe both in Palenqne and in the City of Mexico, pipes have been 
found having their bowl at right angles to the stem. ' The latter, how- 
ever, are made from a glazed, red or gray pottery which there is reason 
to suspect are of Spanish origin and manufacture. While early Span- 
ish writers refer but casually to the habit of smoking among the natives, 
they constantly speak of the use of incense, and there is reason to 



AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 365 





believe that the use of the pipe was often indicated by this exi>ression. 
It must be remembered that smoking, by its general adoption among 
the people, struck all early voyagers to America with astonishment, 
though Si)anish, French, Englisli, and Dutch each in turn found won- 
derful properties in the use of this " sacred herb," 
or, as Everard calls it, "Embassadors' herb."^ 

Fig. 1 is an enlargement, after Oviedo, of 
what is commonly referred to as the first illus- 
tration of the American tobacco pipe, though 
the first two editions of the work did not con- 
tain it. The figure was evidently drawn from 
a description of an instrument which is said to 
have been used as a snuffing tube employed in 
inhaling a preparation of the powder, i)arica. 
This article, Oviedo says, was called a "tobago" 
and it was evidently that which gave its name 
"tobacco" to the plant. The only object of this 
character which has come 
under the observation of the 
writer is a very perfect spec- 
imen in the museum of the 
University of Pennsylvania, 
which is made from the 
femur of a llama, and is 5 

inches long, with a width of li inches at the extrem- 
ity of the bifurcation, the widest part of the bone. 
This tube (fig. -J) is carefully i)olished, and decorated 
on each side with geometric figures, the significance 
of which are indecipherable, though the circles upon 
the bifurcated end look as though intended to rej)re- 
sent eyes. The figures are incised and most skillfully 
executed with some sharj) implement. It was found 
at Tiahuanaco, Bolivia. 

The remarkable similarity of certain smoking cus- 
toms in the most widely separated parts of the con- 
tinent IS the strongest argument iu favor of the 
antiquity of the habit, and there is little doubt that 
the smoking of some plant m pipes or tubes has pre- 
vailed very generally from a time long i)rior to the 
coming of the Europeans on the continent of North 
America. The most primitive pipe of all was a 
straight tube, many of which have been found in abo- 
riginal burial places, from Mexico to the Great Lakes, and from the At- 
lantic to the Pacific oceans. The tube varies, it is true, in both length 
and diameter, as well as in the material from which it is made; governed^

doubtless, by the available supply. Tlie first materials employed would 
be reeds, hollow bones, or wood, wbicb, through a process of evolu- 
tion, came in time eventually to be stone or earthenware. There is 
undoubted evidence that iiipes throughout the continent were made in 
many shapes, though it is probable that the most elaborate are the 
most modern. An endless variety of leaves, twigs, bark, and even the 
roots of plants have been smoked by American Indians, though sumac 
and willow have been used by them to nearly as great an extent as 
tobacco. At times other plants are smoked in preference to tobacco, or 
as a prerequisite of some ceremonial dance or function. 

Excepting the tubular form, the shapes of early American pipes 
differ greatly with the locality where they occur; those in contiguous 
territory usually being similar. The geographical limits of a particular 
pipe, with scarcely an exception, follow the lines of natural trade routes 
and water courses, which are also, it is true, the lines of least resistance 
in the distribution of population, because of the greater facility of 
transportation. 

Notwithstanding the ancient foreign references to a habit apparently 
quite analogous to the use of the tobacco pipe by the American savages, 
Europeans do not appear to have smoked the pipe until tobacco was 
carried abroad from America, for all early travelers to this continent 
appear to have been astonished at the, to them, singular custom of 
smoking, and they were convinced that the tobacco plant was possessed 
of wonderful properties, and but few of them failed to refer to it with 
surprise when they first came in contact with the natives of the 
Northern Continent. 

Columbus on his first voyage mentions the people of Hispaniola as 
smoking, though the reference appears to relate tt) something in the 
nature of a cigar or cigarette rather than a tobacco pipe. Beginning 
with the dawn of man's employment of tools, throughout all primitive 
periods of history, and from the most distant parts of the earth's sur- 
face, similar customs and implements are encountered which are impos- 
sible of reconciliation one with another unless it be that similar 
conditions produce like results. Among these the inhalation of smoke 
is only one of many which might be enumerated. 

Tobacco was indigenous to the new continent, and the first reference 
to its use, though not by name, was that reported to Columbus on his 
first voyage by Kodrigo de Jerez of Agramonte and Luis de Torres, a 
learned Jew, who were sent out in Hispaniola on November 2, 1402, 
with letters to the Kahn of Cathay. De Torres could speak Chaldee, 
Hebrew, and some Arabic, and was thought to be a valuable inter- 
preter for those subjects of the (xrand Kahn whom Columbus should 
encounter.^ 

These messengers, as referred to by the Marquis of Nadaillac, 
quoting Columbus, "found a great number of Indians, men and women. 



' Arthur Helps, The Spanish Conquest in America, I, p, 124, New York, 1856. 



AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 3()7 

holdiDg HI their hands little lighted brands made of herbs, of which 
they inhaled according- to their custom."' According to other writers 
they were said to have indulged in "a fumigation of a peculiar kind." 

The smoke in question was absorbed into the mouth through a 
charred stick, and was caused bj' burning certain herbs wrai)ped in 
a dry leaf, which outer covering was called "tabaco."^ 

These messengers, says John Harris, "lighting of an Indian town of 
fifty houses, they were well treated there, the Spanish being honored 
as if they had been deities."^ Quite as indefinite is the expression 
"incensing," later employed on the mainland u])on numerous occasions 
in the various accounts of Cortez's march to the City of Mexico, or as 
"perfuming themselves." Las Casas, who was a contemporary of 
Columbus, and the first bishop of Chiapas, is quoted as saying that the 
•'two messengers met great numbers of people of both sexes, the men 
always with a firebrand in their hands and certain herbs for smoking. 
These were dry, and placed in a dry leaf, after the manner of those 
paper tubes which the boys in Spain use at Whitsuntide. Lighting 
one end, they drew the smoke by sucking at the other. This causes 
drowsiness and a kind of intoxication, aud, according to the statement 
of natives, relieves them from the feeling of fatigue. These tubes they 
call by the name of TolacosJ^* 

In the early references to smoking a notable peculiarity is that the 
term employed very commonly is "herbs," which may be because of 
Ignorance of the ]>lant smoked, though it is certainly suggestive also 
of there being more than one, for it is known that certain of our 
Indians consider it an essential to their ceremonial smokes or dances 
to have a mixture of different plants to put in the pipe; though when 
smoking for the purpose of becoming stupefied or intoxicated tobacco 
is used. The "firebrand" mentioned by Las Casas was " a kind of 
n)usquetoon packed of a dry leaf, which the Indians lit at one end 
while they sucked it or inhaled it from the other. These musquetoons 
were called Tabacos."'' 

Xadaillac says it is here easy to recognize the cigar of the present 
day, "of which the shape has had but slight modifications." The same 
could with equal accuracy be said of the cigarette. Cigars and ciga- 
rettes appear so common in all Spanish America as to cause a strong 
presumption that one Or other was intended, though the early references 
are invariably indefinite. 

Las Casas, according to Helps, states that the Indians when ques- 
tioned about imbibing tobacco smoke said that it took away fatigue.

and that he has knowu Spaniards in tlie island of Hispaniola who 
adopted the same habit, and who, being reproved for it as a vice, replied 
that it was not in their power to leave it ofl". " 1 do not know," he adds, 
"what savor or profit they found in them (tobacos)."' 

Millions of people throughout the world still sympathize with this 
sentiment. The habit has increased until it has encircled the earth, 
and to-day there is scarcely a race which has not adopted the pipe in 
some form, though not always coniining themselves to tobacco. Opium 
is a rival to it in some parts of the East, and hasheesh ( Cannabis sativa), 
an East Indian hemp, is smoked in India for its intoxicating properties. 
Some idea may be gained of the consumption of tobacco from the pro- 
duction of the manufactured article in the United States in 1897, which 
for smoking tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes amounted to the enormous 
sum of 371,705,148 pounds. How many of those who consume this 
tobacco ever consider " what profit they found in it f " There are many, 
who agree with Benzoni, of Milan, who, about 1541, said, " See what a 
pestiferous and wicked poison from the devil this nuist be. It has 
happened several times to me that going through the provinces of 
Guatemala and Nicaragua I have entered the house of an Indian who 
had taken this herb, which in the Mexican language is called tobacco, 
and, immediately perceiving this sharp, fetid smell, I was obliged to go 
away in haste and seek some other place. In La Espana and other 
islands when their doctors wanted to cure a sick man they went to the 
place where they were to administer the smoke, and when the patient 
was thoroughly intoxicated by it the cure was mostly effected."^ 

To many smoking is only a habit admittedly without profit; to others 
it is a "pestiferous weed;" to others again smoking is a solace and 
unfailing comforter in solitude or sickness; to its votaries it is often a 
nerve tonic of priceless value in times of great mental excitement, and 
a sedative in favor of which too much can scarcely be said. 

Speaking of the messengers of Columbus who first witnessed smok- 
ing, it is interesting to note the opinion of Washington Irving, who 
speaks of tobacco as a weed which "the ingenious caprice of man has 
converted into a luxury in defiance of the opposition of the senses."^ 

Bernal Diaz, who was first with Juan de Grijalva, in 1518, on the 
coast of the mainland of the continent, and who appears also to have 
been, in 1517, with Francisco Hernandez de Cordova in his expedition, 
accompanied Cortez throughout his wonderful march to the City of 
Mexico. Of his early history little appears known, though it is sup- 
posed he was a foot soldier. The historian of the conquest, and thor- 
oughly familiar with the daily events of the period, he wrote about

AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 369 

1568, aud in the light of contemporary accounts there is little doubt 
that many of his references to the natives using "perfumes" aud 
"incense'' related to the practice of smoking tobacco or other plants. 
It is not intended to deny that incense or perfume was used in the 
temi)les of Mexico or among the natives upon occasion, but it is con- 
tended that these terms, where used by the Spanish historians, referred 
generally to what we now describe as smoking, rather than to what is 
understood by the term perfuming or incensing. Upon several occasions 
where these words are employed contemporaneous writers are so clear 
in their references to tobacco smoking as to leave little room for doubt. 
Spanish descriptions can be better appreciated when it is remembered 
that the practices referred to were novel to the writers, and the only 
thing to which they could liken it was the incense of the church, with 
which they were all familiar. The Spanish references to the smoking 
of tobacco are apparently confined to its employment by the great 
"lords" after their dinners, though many of them point to the use 
of tobacco in conjunction with other things, such as liquid amber, etc. 

It must not be forgotten that ceremony and the ceremonial observ- 
ance of all serious events in life occupied a great part of the Mexicans' 
time, and the same was the case with the aborigines to the north of 
Mexico. It will be shown that tobacco was later the plant almost 
invariably smoked at solemn and ceremonial councils with the whites 
throughout the continent. In Mexico and to the northward for an 
indefinite distance there appears always to have been a mixture of 
herbs used in local ceremonies, as is yet the case in some of the Pueblo 
dances, especially those of Moki. Juan de Grijalva, the discoverer of 
Mexico, who died in 1527, according to Diaz, embraced the natives "in 
token of peace, gave them strings of beads, and as it is customary to 
make amicable presents in amicable treaties, they [the natives] came 
with fish, fowl, and vessels with lighted coals to fumigate us with 
incense;" aud at what is now St. Juan de Ulloa, he says, "upon our 
entering [the temple] they came to us with their pots of incense, but 
we could not endure it, being disgusted and grieved at the sight and 
the horrid cruelty of their sacrifices." ' 

The ingredients of this "incense," if Clavigero be correct, were not 
such as to recommend it to the favor of Europeans, and fortunately do 
not appear to have survived to our time. He says : " The priests took 
large quantities of poisonous insects, such as scorpions, spiders, and 
worms, and sometimes even small serpents, burned them over the 
stove of the temple, and beat their ashes into a mortar together with 
the soot of the ocotl [a species of very aromatic pine], tobacco, the 
herb ololimbqui, and some live insects."^ 

That this offering was identical with that of the pipe, so common on 
the northern continent at the end of the last century, is shown by the 

'Diaz, True History of tlie Conquest of Mexico, i)p. 17, 20, London, 1800.

same writer, who says: "These offerings of incense were made also by 
the women to the idols, which was not confined to an act of religion 
to their gods, but also a piece of civil courtesy to lords and ambassa- 
dors." ' 

Diaz says that upon a certain occasion in the island of Cozumel 
(1519), the Spaniards having been attracted to a certain temple, ''the 
Indians were found burning odoriferous resins like an incense,"^ and 
later he states that the Mexicans sent their " ambassadors with vessels 
of incense which they offered us and with which they fumigated Cor- 
tez."^ This function is repeatedly referred to during the march, as 
occurring with the Tlascalans, the Cholulans, and at the city of 
Quivistlan, nor was it confined to offerings to Cortez, but to whoever 
was the leader at the i)articular time. We encounter the same cere- 
mony offered at Villa Rica to Escalante, who was there "fumigated." 
The most casual consideration of this practice shows so great an anal- 
ogy between these " incense burnings" and " fumigations" (especially 
as tobacco is mentioned among the ingredients composing it), and the 
calumet dances and offerings to leaders, not only of the French on the 
Mississippi and the Great Lakes, but also to the English along the 
Eastern seaboard, as to .amount to conviction that the offerings in many 
cases was of the pipe.* 

Four days after the arrival of the army in the City of Mexico Cortez 
and Montezuma visited the temple and witnessed the offering of 
incense to the war gods,' and it is yet observable at Moki in the dances, 
where they invariably offer smoke to their idols, the ceremonies of the 
pipe being observed by all present with great solemnity and decorum. 
The head chief is attended by an assistant of nearly like rank, who 
ceremoniously lights the pipe, and with a certain form and set words 
hands it to the chief, who blows the smoke of the pipe to the world 
quarters and over the altar. 

At times offerings were made by "those who happened to be in dan- 
ger from stumbling or slipping or on a journey." Incense offerings, 
Clavigero says, "wen; made four times a day — at daybreak, midday, 
sunset, and midnight. They used copal [Burnera] or some other aro- 
matic gum, and on certain festivals employed chapopotli or bitumen 
of Judea,'' which was also used by the women to clean their teeth with." 
Similar practices are noted later on the Mississippi among the 
Natchez, whose offerings were made to the sun, and the Indians of 
Virginia, a century afterwards, were said to make offerings of tobacco 
in setting out on a journey. 

The censers of the Mexicans were commonly made of clay, but they

also had them of gold, aud no bouse was witbout them nor wanted 
idols.' 

These censers or pipes and idols or fetiches appear to the writer the 
same things under different names, tbe variance being due to differ- 
ence in time aud to tbe nationality of those describing the one aud tbe 
other. Clavigero on one occasion refers to ambassadors making their 
offerings "by touching the earth with their bands," ^ which Antonio de 
Solis tlcscribes minutely in his reference to tbe ambassadors from Tlas- 
cala, "who every now and then stopped aud made signs of respect with 
humility toward the quarters, bowing their bodies till they touched the 
ground with their hands; then, raising themselves and putting them 
to their lips, i)aid greater respect with the smoke of their censers."-' 

This is a similar exhibition to that spoken of when Cortez made 
peace with the Cacique of Tabasco, after first repulsing an embassy of 
an inferior quality of persons who returned in niimbers with their orna- 
ments, aud, having approached with great submission, they perfumed 
him "with their fire pans, in which they burned gum anime (a white 
resin), gum copal, and other sweet scents."^ 

These savages "in their festival given in honor of their war god, 
Huitzilopochtli, were, by permission of Alvarado, allowed to come 
unarmed, and having done so, were set upon by his orders and not an 
Aztec was left alive."'' 

Tbese natives were idolatrous and low among the races of men, 
according to the belief of the period, and the puuishment of death was 
considered light for their inherited wickedness; yet some of the Spanish 
practices are as barbarous as anything noted of the Aztec, especially 
that of dressing their wounds with the fat of dead Indians, to which 
Diaz quaintly refers, a practice apparently common at that period, for, 
according to Biedma. De Soto's soldiers, about 154:0, who were wounded 
"had their wounds dressed with the fat of the slain, because our medi- 
cine was burnt with the baggage." " 

In fig. 3 is again seen a conical object, similar to that on the Paleuque 
tablet, which Prof. Cyrus Thomas takes to be a cigar. Its similarity 
to the primitive conical pipe is, however, so striking as to impress one 
witb tbe idea that this figure, wherever encountered, is intended for a 
pipe. Tbe illustration is taken from Tbe Manuscrijit Troano, Plate 
XXI,' and is doubly interesting because antedating European contact.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897, 



All early references to smoking are exceedingly indefinite, due to the 
writers trying to convey to their readers their impressions of something 
entirely novel, and consequently most difficult to describe for want of 
something with which to compare it. 

It must be admitted that the early references to smoking in America, 
while showing it to be a common practice among the Mexicans, so far 
as known to the writer do not suggest the rectangular pipe. All Spanish 
American people smoke the cigarette or cigar. As early as 175H it was 
said of the natives of Carthagena : " Every one smokes, men and women 
alike, without distinction of age or rank. They petiin everywhere and 
on all occasions. The women hold in their mouths a iiiece of lighted 
tobacco, from which they draw the smoke for quite a length of time 
without letting it go out and without the fire inconveniencing them, 

and one of the greatest acts of 
'.'.'•-. if',*"'.. friendship which they can evi- 

dence to a person is to light the 
tobacco for them." ' 

This refers apparently to cigar 
or cigarette smoking, which was 
probabl}^ the survival of a native 
custom. 

Edward B. Tylor says "the 
Mexicans were cultivating 
tobacco when the Spaniards in- 
vaded the country, and had done 
so for ages; it had gotten its 
name from the languageof Haiti, 
meaning not the tobacco itself 
but the cigars made of it."^ 

There is no doubt that tobacco 
was cultivated ; but only to a lim- 
ited extent, prior to the Spanish invasion. As soon as the conijuest was 
accomplished the Spaniards put the natives to work in mining the 
precious metals and in growing tobacco, for which there was a con- 
stant and increasing demand. 

De Solis says of Montezuma: "He used to smoke tobacco perfumed 
with liquid amber [Liquiclambar sti/racijiua, or sweet gum], and this 
vicious habit passed for a medicine with the Indians, which withal had 
somewhat in it of superstition, for the juice of tliis herb was one of the 
ingredients with which the priests were worked up into madness and 
fury as often as they were obliged to prepare themselves by losing their 
understanding to receive the devil's oracles." ^

AMERICA]Sr ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS 373 

Clavigero, an uuusually well-informed writer, who lived among the 
natives of Mexico for tbirty-odd years, about the middle of the last eeu- 
tury, referring to the early Mexican practice of smoking, says: "After 
dining the lords used to compose themselves to sleep with the smoke of 
tobacco. This plant was greatly in use among the Mexicans. Tliey 
make various plasters with it. and took it not only in smoke at the 
mouth, but also in snuff at the nose. In order to smoke it they jjut the 
leaves, with the gum of liquid amber and other hot, warm, and odorifer- 
ous herbs, into a little pipe of wood or reed, or some other more valuable 
substance. They receive the smoke by sucking the pipe and shutting 
the nostrils with the fingers, so that it might pass by the breath more 
easily to ward the lungs. * * * But what ought to excite still greater 
wonder is that, although the use of tobacco is now so common among 
those natives who formerly despised it, it is now so rare among its 
inventors that there are extremely few of the Indians of N"ew Spain 
who take it in smoke, and none at all who use it in snuftV • 

The more closely the manners and customs of the Aztecs and other 
natives of Mexico are studied the greater is found to be the similarity 
between them and the northern Indians, the real difference being that 
the Mexican has been described in glowing terms as possessing a well- 
organized government, whereas the prosaic Indian has been represented 
and treated very much as a savage, having no good qualities. Dr. J. 
Walter Fewkes has found among the Moki Indians of New Mexico a 
cigarette, which answers completely that described as being used by 
the Mexicans. It is a small reed, not over 2^ inches long, into which 
they pack tobacco; a band of some fabric is bound around it and sewed 
into the reed, leaving a tiap hanging down by which to hold it. These 
cigarettes are found in large numbers in the sacrificial caves in the 
vicinity, and appear to be a survival of one of the most primitive of 
smoking arrangements. The natives of Mexico are fond of a weed 
called Mariguana (?), for mixing with the tobacco in their cigarettes, 
which when it is smoked and inhaled by them is said to produce a 
hilarious spirit in the smoker.^ 

A curious custom is related of the people of Yucatan. The children 
at a particular period made offerings to certain animals, which in a 
measure were cousidered as their sponsors through life. This offering 
was "made of a certain gum of pleasant smell, called copal, which they 
burn as an incense upon an altar. These animals were wild beasts, 
which were supposed to have assumed responsibility for the children 
who had been exposed in certain localities in their earliest infancy, 
and were known by the tracks found near them in the morning after a 
night of exposure."^

Prescott says the pipes used by the Mexican were "made of var- 
nished and richly gilt wood, from which he inhaled sometimes through 
the nose, at others through the mouth, the fames of an intoxicating 

weed called tobacco, mingled 
with liquid amber." ' 

Diaz, however, identifies 
them "as three little canes 
highly ornamented, containing 
lifiuid amber mixed with an 
herb called tobacco, which 
when brought" to Montezuma 
"he took a little of the smoke 
of one of these canes and then 
laid himself down to sleep."-^ 

Kingsborough illustrates, in 
his great work on the "Antiq- 
uities of Mexico," two figures 
of persons who appear to be 
smoking pipes, though in the

text he does not refer to them as such 
who is dressed in netting with large mesh, 
claws, and in his mouth appears to be a pipe; only the head of the figure 
is here reproduced. The sec- 
ond person (fig. 5) holds in hi.s 
hand a pipe, and has in the 
left hand, apparently, a bou- 
quet; the object in the right 
hand Kingsborough refers to 
as a cane. He says these fig- 
ures are scantily clothed to 
show their confidence in the 
field, as they are certain to 
return with sufficient booty 
to weigh them down.-' 

Clavigero speaks of the 
Mexicans using " pijies or 
reeds " containing tobacco 
aiidliquid amber and "which 
were beautifully varnished." ^ 

According to Bernal Diaz, 
as quoted by Bancroft, these 
pipes were painted and gilt.^

Diaz also says that sweet canes filled with tobacco and mixed with 
liquid amber were sold in the city.' 

Montezuma's sleep differed but little from that of the Indian who 
slei)t stui)efled from the inhahition of the fumes of tobacco, a practice 
quite commonly adopted, anioug" many of the American Indians, notably 
those along the Pacific coasts, and whose habits, from geographic loca- 
tion, we would naturally expect to find similar to those of their neigh- 
bors, and from whom there is reason to suppose they copied the habit, 
even if they did not receive it from the Spaniards. Clavigero distinctly 
implies the similarity of the Mexican habit to what is known to exist 
north of Mexico. He says '' they receive the smoke by sucking the 
pipe and shutting the nostrils with their fingers, so that it might pass 
by the breath more easily toward the lungs."^ 

Even as early as 1541-1550 Benzoni, of Milan, tells how slaves brought 
by the Spaniards "from Ethiopia preserved the leaves of a plant which 
grows in these new countries which was picked in its season, tied up in 
bundles, and suspended by them near their fireplaces until very dry; to 
use them they take a leaf of their grain (maize), and, one of the other 
plant being put in it, they roll them tight together." He then describes 
the inhalation of this, which is neither cigar nor cigarette, though hav- 
ing properties of both, and says: "So much do they fill themselves with 
this cruel smoke, that they loose their reason and fall down as though 
they were dead, and remain the greater part of the day or night stupe- 
fied, though others are content with imbibing this smoke to make them 
giddy and no more." ' 

Nicolas Monardes, of Seville, was the first, apparently, who spoke of 
the tobacco plant by its present name. In De Simplicibus Medica- 
mentes, Antwerp, 1574, which is translated into French in Historic des 
Drogues, Lyons, 1602, by A. Colin, he, as all others have done, dis- 
cussed its properties along with those of other medicitial plants. He 
refers to copal and anime, both of which were gums which gave off 
strong odors when burned, and were also used in the sacrifices in the 
temi)les and were held to the noses of the Spaniards when they came 
to the country, as an incense,^ and were at times used in connection 
with tobacco, as were other gums, such as storax, tacamahaca, and 
liquidamber,'' the latter of which was obtained by making incisions 
through the bark of the tree, by which means a resin exuded, and by 
mixing it with the powdered bark it gave a stronger odor.'' 

The tobacco plant undoubtedly owes its great popularity to the won- 
derful properties which were early ascribed to it, chief of which Mo-

nardes says, was its curative qualities with wounds. He further says 
it was first carried to Spaiu as much for its beauty and ornament in 
gardens as for its virtues. 

" The name tobacco was given to it by the Spanish from the island of 
the same name, and wliile only the use of the leaves of the plant is 
advised, seed was at times utilized when the leaves were not avail- 
able. These leaves were strung together, hung in the shade and dried, 
and used whole or powdered, and were considered good for headache, 
lockjaw, toothache, coughs, asthma, stomach ache, obstructions, kidney 
troubles, disease of the heart, rheumatism, the poisoning from arrows, 
carbuncles, polypus, consumption," etc' 

The methods of using the plant were almost as numerous as the dis- 
eases for which it was considered a cure, a few of which are enumerated 
as follows: To heat the leaves and apply them to the parts affected ; to 
rub the teeth with a rag dipped in the juice; wrapping a leaf into a pill 
and inserting it in the tooth; boiling the leaves; decoctions of its 
leaves; made into a sirup; smoking it by the mouth; reducing the 
leaves to ashes; pounding the green leaves and mixing them with oil 
or steeping them in vinegar ; if leaves are not to be had, the powder may 
be used as a poultice; in fomentations; by smoking through the nose; 
rubbing the leaves on the afflicted parts; inserting the juice into the 
wound or applying bruised leaves to the wound. 

Monardes says: ^'Tobacco smoke was received by the nose, and in 
smoking the i^riests received the smoke through little tubes or canes, 
and after they tumbled as if in ecstacy. Upon recovering, they related 
what they had conversed about with the evil spirits, and gave ambigu- 
ous replies to their followers. In addition to this, the people take the 
smoke both by the mouth and by the nose for pleasure when they 
desire to see the future in their dreams. For just as the devil is an 
imposter and knows the virtue of herbs, he has posted them on the 
power of this plant, for by the illusions of their dreams he deceives 
the people miserably."^ 

"The Indians, tired from carrying their burdens or from other work, 
inhaled tobacco smoke and fell suddenly as though deprived of reason, 
and when they recovered found themselves refreshed by their sleep and 
their strength restored. The Ethiopians, carried to these x)arts as slaves, 
wishing to lighten their condition, inhale too much, which causes their 
masters to chastise them severely, and they burn their tobacco to keep 
them from using so much, which leaves as a sole alternative to use it in 
secret. The Indians use tobacco to keep away thirst and hunger, and 
do it in the following way: They burn certain river shells, then powder- 
ing them as fine as chalk, they mix them with an equal quantity of 
powdered tobacco and chew it until it forms a solid mass; then they 
make it into pills slightly larger than a pea; then, drying it again.

they use it wben needed. In making a journey tliroiigli a desert 
country, where food and drink are scarce, they put these pills between 
their lips and teeth and suck the juice, and when one is gone they 
replace it with another through a journey extending over three or 
four days, during which time they say they have not been hnngry 
or thirsty.''' 

Tlie inhabitants of Brazil were the first to carry the seed of this plant 
to Portugal, and called it petum. The French called it herbe la reine, 
because Jean Xicot, formerly Portuguese ambassador, gave the seed to 
the Queen Mother and explained to her its virtues and i^roperties. 
Others called it herbe sainte, because of its great power, and " it appears 
to me," Monardes says, "to answer very well the description of black 
henbane." ^ 

Monardes evidently refers to cigars and j)ipes in speaking of tubes 
proper to be used by asthmatics. He says: "There are brought from 
New Spain certain tubes of cane, greased inside and outside with a 
certain gum, which, in my opinion, is nothing else than juice of the 
tobacco, for it goes to the head. On the side called bitumen they burn 
the tube, while on the other side they put it in the mouth and smoke by 
inhaling."^ 

Wafer describes a curious smoking custom among the people of 
Darien in 16S1. " The tobacco leaves," he says, " are rolled up sideways 
until they make a roll as big as one's wrist and two or three feet in 
length. A boy lights one end, wetting the part next to it to keep it 
from wasting too fast. He puts the lighted end in his mouth and blows 
into the faces of the company, even if there should be two or three 
hundred, and they hold their breath as long as possible."* Though 
among the Maya people the pipe is not now smoked, and it is doubtful 
if it ever was. 

These authorities are sufficient to establish the fact that the island- 
ers and Mexicans were acquainted, not only with the cigarette but also 
with the cig.ir, though the "reed" of the Mexicans approaches more 
nearly the pipe or tube than either. This reed pipe is noted in 1540 on 
the lower Colorado by Alarcon, the natives being described as carry- 
ing " small reed tubes for making perfumes, as do the Indian tabagos 
of New Spain," •'^ and if cigarettes are referred to, custom has changed 
but little, and is still in daily use by the Zuni and Moki of New Mexico. 
" The doctors cured their patients by blowing on them with thin tubes

used for scraping ott" the sweat were worn upon the other.' 

Prescott refers to "pipes of tortoise shell and silver, containing 
tobacco mixed with aromatic substances, which were offered to the 
company by the Mexicans, whom, he says, compressed the nostrils while 
they inhaled the smoke," ^ showing that its purjiose was to stupify the 
smoker. Dr. Fewkes, excavating during the summer of 1895 at the 
ruins of Sikyatki, in northeastern Arizona, found several tubes or pipes 

much resembling cigarette hold- 
ers, and as the excavations here 
showed that only a primitive 
condition existed at the time of 
the abandonment of the town or 
pueblo, the i)resumption is in 
favor of its antiquity, and may 
reasonably be considered pre- 
Columbian. These tnbes, which 
were straight, though the bowl 
was much larger than the stem, were made both of stone and of pottery. 
Fig. G is a pottery specimen, which might well answer the description 
of one of Montezuma's varnished pipes, referred to by Prescott. It is 
2h inches long and about three-fourths of an inch wide across the 
mouthpiece. The clay from which this pipe was made was finely pul 
verized, and so far as can be seen contains no ground shell or sand, 
sucli as is usually found in aboriginal pottery, and which was supposed 
to be intended as a tempering, to 
prevent cracking in drying or 
heating. On each of the ends of 
this specimen, for a distance of 
one-half an inch, there is a per- 
fectly smooth and dark brown, 
almost black, glazed surface. The 
raised portion of this tube gives 
the effect of a jacket shrunken 
on, which is covered by a series 

of closely incised lines, forming a band, as though made by wrapping 
a thread on the clay while it was in the plastic condition. This pipe 
might well be taken for varnished wood by anyone not familiar with 
the material. 

Fig. 7 is also a i^ottery tube from Sikyatki, of ])inkish red color, quite 
symmetrical in shape, the type of which is not dissimilar to like objects 
found as far north as the State of Ohio. The type is common throughout 
the whole pueblo region. The specimen figured has a dull glazed surface, 
without polish, and similar thread marks to those referred to on fig. 6.

These thread marks look as though the thread wrapped around the 
plastic clay had beeu left on while the pottery was going throngh 
the cooking process, being burned off in 
the baking. 

Fig. 8, from Sikyatki, and also made of 
pottery like the others, is a pipe of a dull 
gray color. It is elliptical in cross section, 
and though a part of the bowl upon one 
side has been broken away, sufficient re- 
mains to show its original form. On the 
broader sides of this pipe upon the band 
there is a slightly raised surface, upon 
which are intersecting lines, evidently cut 
into the earthenware subsecjuently to its 
baking. Tins specimen looks as though 

the incised marks were intended to rei^resent conventional birds' wings, 
though It may well be that some other significance attaches to it. 

Fig. 9 is from the pueblo of Taos, in New Mexico. Dr. Fewkes 
obtained it by i)urchase, and therefore it is impossible to speak posi- 
tively concerning its age, 
?'WilWP^P^''^^^Zif^^f^ .^^ though it belongs to the 

same type as the preced- 
ing specimens, andif of a 
different period the char- 
acteristics remain con- 
stant. It is of glazed 
black pottery, containing 
a slight admixture of finely pounded shell, its hues of ornamenta- 
tion being cut through the surface subsequent to the firing of the 
clay. It is 6 inches long, having a greatest diameter of 1 inch, and 
a circular cross section. 

Fig. 10, a light gray earth- 
enware from Nambe, New Mex- 
ico, was also obtained by Dr. 
Fewkes by purchase. It is 3 
inches long and for two-thirds 
of its length is 2 inches wide, 
due to the wing like projections 
attached to the elongated 
conoidal tube. These wings, 
while apparently intended for 
ornament, would answer perfectly 
for holding the pipe when heated. 
The type is primitive and common to the territory of the cliff dwellers.

throughout the southwestern United States. The pipe on its outer sur- 
face is covered by peculiar protuberances, not unlike large coffee grains 
set on edge, as though the clay in its plastic condition had been pinched 
up by the thumb and forefinger. A pipe having similar coffee like 
grains upon its surface is in the collection of Mr. Andrew E. Douglass, 
of New York, and is said to have been found 6 feet below the surface of 
a bird shaped mound in Eastman, Crawford County, Wisconsin. The 
latter specimen, however, is of the rectangular type, with an unusually 
large bowl, the ])ottery of which is a mixture of clay and shell. 

There are a number of pipes of the Pueblo type in the collection of 
the University of Pennsylvania, which were found in the ruins of the 
cliff" d\yellers of the Mancos Canyon in Colorado, one of which, 3^ inches

catlinite; yet another, with slightly shorter tube, has a catlinite bowl 
with a bone stem. The stems of each are held in place by the gum 
of the grease wood {Sarcohatus). There is also in the same collection a 
short, hard-burned pottery tube of this type, 
said to be from ancient Mexico, upon the sur- 
face of which there is a rudely modeled head 
of a duck, the eye being pierced through.

During the summer of 1897, Dr. Fewkes, at 
Four Mile Euin, near Fort Apache, in Arizona, found a number of 
pipes of the cigarette type, one of which is made from a stalagmite. 
The specimens from this ruin do not appear, however, to be so ancient 
as those from Sikyatki. The writer has seen a photograph of a stone 
pipe excavated from an ancient grave on the "N. H." ranch, in New 
Mexico, collected by tlie Rev. Dr. Niess, of an elongated conical shape, 
very similar to the pipes from the coast of California, upon which are 
four longitudinal color stripes corresponding to the cardinal quarters. 
This pipe is about 8 inches long and similar to that represented on 
the Palenque tablet, and in the Manuscript Troano. The only other 
pipe having artificial color which has come under the writer's notice is 
a hard-burned pottery specimen from the cliff ruin of Mancos, Colorado, 
in the collection of the University of Pennsylvania, the bowl of which 
has been broken, the interior being smeared with some white color, 
probably connected with ancient burial customs. The University of 
Pennsylvania also possesses a number of bowls of tubular pipes, some 
made of shale and others of slate, the steins of which were evidently 
held by means of some foreign substance, as was the case with the 
pipes from California; and there are indications that in the middle 
Atlantic Coast States the same method of attaching the stem was

employed. At Tusayau, ISIew Mexico, as noted by Dr. Fewkes — and 
his remarks would apply equally to North America generall}' — " Indiau 
customs are handed down through long periods with but slight variations. 
At Tusayan, native tobacco {Nicotiana aftenuata) was used in the cer- 
emonies The Indians there smoke, however, the leaves of various 
plants, as the^^ use various mixtures in their religious rites. The one 
who controls the pipe must light it and baud it immediately to the 
chief, friendly words being exchanged between the two. The chief 
blows the smoke toward the four cardinal poiuts, upward and down- 
ward over the altar. They beheve that the smoke is the cloud symbol- 
ized by it. Tliey use the utmost care in making the mixture of tobacco 
which is to serve for this sacred purpose, and the pipe must be lit with 

fire produced in the manner 
prescribed by the rite. All 
ceremonies commence with 
this brotherly smoking."' 

Dr. Fewkes informed the 
writer that the plants of which 
Fig. 12. the mixture used in the pipe 

was composed were valued 
largely according to the dis- 
tance from which they came, 
and a plant from Colorado, which he gave a Pueblo Indian in New 
Mexico, was said to be good pipe medicine to smoke for that reason. 
In ceremonial smoking, or, in fact, in any of the more serious functions, 
the white man's manufactured tobacco was not considered valuable. 
"The xochiocotzotl, commonly called liquidambar, is the liquid storax 
of the Mexicans. It is a great tree, its leaves being similar to those of 
the maple, white in one part and dark in the other, disposed in threes. 
By an incision in the trunk they extract that precious resin called by 
the Spaniards liquidambar, and the oil of the same name is still more 
odorous and estimable. They also obtain liquidambiir from a decoction of 
the branches, but it is inferior to that which is distilled from the trunk."^ 
The Sia Indians are said to smoke a thin cigarette, lighted from a 
long stick; the boys of the Sia were, however, never seen smoking.^ 

In the sixteen-soug snake dance of the Moki Indians, both before the 
dance begins and after it is over, Dr. Fewkes found that the shape of 
the pipe smoked had no significance; but the pipe which was employed 
at the eud of the eighth song was invariably one of the old-fashioned 
tubular conical pipes of the same character as those used by the ancient 
inhabitants, as evidenced at Sikyatki.

TUBULAR PIPES OF THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS GENERALLY. 

There is in the U. S. National Museum collection a black pottery 
specimen of the tube, about the shape of a cigar and the size of one (Cat. 
No. 47759) from San Juan, New Mexico, which is in the Abbott Collec- 
tion. It is of a dull black color, resembling stone; the upper rim of 
the bowl, having been cracked, is neatly repaired or reinforced by bind- 
ing it around with fine sinew thread wrapped until it has formed quite 
a band. This mode of repair is primitive and interesting as being a 
probable survival of ancient methods. 

Another and unique pipe is a tube in the U. S. National Museum 
having a square exterior, and is made of black glazed pottery. It was 

collected by Col. 
^ ""~^\ James Stevenson at 

Santa Clara, New 
Mexico, and has a

Fig. 13 is a tubular implement, of a compact variety of slate, collected 
by Mr. W. C. Norris from a mound in Boone County, West Virginia. 
This tube is 8g inches long, with a uniform diameter of 1 inch, the per- 
foration, except at the flattened end, being of a diameter of three-fourths 
of an inch. This tube unfortunately has been broken, the flattened 
mouthpiece of which at its widest i)art measures 2^ inches across, has a 
thickness of scarcely one-fourth of an inch; through this a perforation 
about three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter has been drilled into the 
larger part of the tube. The walls are about one-eighth of an inch 
thick, the opening having been drilled by means of a hollow metal drill 
1)0 int. 

This tube is similar to one figured by Squier and Davis from the 
neighborhood of Chillicothe, Ohio, whi(;h they considered superior to 
anything of which the present Indian was capable.' 

There is one of these tubes made of pottery in the Museum of the 
University of Pennsylvania, 4^ inches long, found in Portage County, 
Ohio.

The writer is inclined to class this tube among the pipes, though he 
does so with some doubt. It should not, however, be confounded with 
those carefully polished implements having thin walls bored by means 
of tubular drills to within one-half or one-fourth of an inch of the end, 
which are flat, and have one-eighth-inch holes bored through them, and 
which were probably intended to be used as horns, as they certainly 
answer that purpose perfectly, giving as they do a strong, clear note. 
The surfaces of these tubes are finished to a high polish and appear to 
the writer to be due to the use of tools of civilized men. There is a 
striking similarity in the mouthpiece of this tube and the specimen 
figured from the ancient ruin of Sikyatki. 

Fig. 14 is '-a tube of copper collected by Prof. E. B. Andrews on Mr. 
George Connett's land, on Wolf Plain, Ohio, which was found with 
human remains. Professor Putnam describes it as being made of sheet 
copper hammered 
over wood, a little 
Uole one-eighth of an 
inch in diameter be- 
ing cut or i)unched 
to one side of the 
center of the mouth- 
piece. The tube, he 
says, is 5i inches 
long and three- 
fourths of an inch 

in diameter in the circular part and 2 inches at the flattened end." 
Professor Putnam calls attention to the possibility of this class of 
implements being intended for pipes. Tubes found in the collection 
of the U. S. National Museum intended as horns or pipes vary all the 
way from 2 inches to 10 inches in length, with a diameter of from 
one-half an inch to 2 inches. Usually they are made of stone, though 
tubes of pottery are not unknown. The Indian was as a rule skillful 
in selecting material for pipes, the larger proportion of which were 
made from chlorite or steatite, though sandstone, quartzite, and other 
minerals equally unsuited for x)ipe making are encountered at times. 
The cross section of the tubular pipe varies between a flattened ellip- 
soid and a circle. They are conoidal in their longer diameter, having 
usually a large bowl gradually decreasing in size to the mouthpiece. 
While it may reasonably be inferred that the original i^ipe was a reed, 
or hollow bone, or a piece of wood split and scooped out, or possibly a 
horn, there is no doubt that everything capable of holding tobacco has 
at one time or another been used by American Indians for smoking, 
instances being known where birch bark, lobster claws, and, most 
inappropriate of all, stone coal has served for pipe making. 

Fig. 15 IS a pipe made from the metatarsal bone of a deer, than which 
it were difficult to imagine a more primitive production. It has a length 
of 7 inches. One end of the bone has been hammered ofl', while the

opposite end has been cut down to a size which could readily be placed 
in the mouth, leaving the natural cavity to hold the smoking material. 
Fig. IG shows that the Indian has been taught the frailty of the sim- 
l)le bone when exposed to the heat of the burning leaves. This bone is 
of the same character as that of the ])receeding pipe, and has been reen- 
forced with strips of rawhide wrapped on wet and allowed to shrink. 
Except the cutting oft' and wear on the ends of these bones there 

api)ears to have 
been nothing done 
with either, other 
than the reenforce- 
ment of the hide. 

The writer is in- 
formed by Capt. H. 
L. Scott, of the 
U. S. Army, that the pipe used in the medicine dance by the Kiowas, 
which is held in the summer, is in the custody of the medicine keeper 
and descended to this tribe from the Arapahoes, who in turn received 
it from the Crows in the far north. It is straight and made of a black 
stone. The sacred pipe of the Arapahoes, which has an antiq^uity, 
according to their tradition, as great as that of the tribe itself and 
which is valued beyond price by them, is a straight tube made of a 
black stone and is at present in possession of the northern division of 
the tribe, which is in Wyoming. White Beaver, in a letter to Dr. E. A. 
Barber, of Philadelphia, says, "From 'Medicine Smoke' — big lire, or 
He-mon-e-gah — a son of the head chief of the Winuebagoes, I yesterday 
heard a legend of the use 
of sha-sha or red willow" 
[iSalix purpurea], "not to- 
bacco." He refers to the 
unwrapping of " a j)ipe 
made from the shin bone 
of an elk which was em- 
ployed at a treaty of peace 

made between the Winnebagoes and the Sioux, which was only broken 
when the pipe was polluted by the chah-de — tobacco of a nation or 
place where the sun rises." 

Prince Maximilian says of the pipe of the Assinniboines that it was 
generally made of blackish stone or dark clay, in which they smoked 
the herb kinnikinick, or the leaves of the bearberry {Arctostaphylos 
tiva-ursi), mixed with tobacco. He refers also to a pipe used by the 
Indians of the upper Missouri, who employ it on warlike excursions, the 
bowl and stem of which are in the same line, as a tube.^ 

The Blackfeet use in their pipes the bearberry, which they call 
"sakakomi," and which in company each person passes to the left.^ 
There appear to be but few exceptions to the rule that the straight

tube was the saeiecl pipe of the Indian, and tliat this has been a gen- 
eral and ancient practice may be inferred from tinding snch tubes 
throughout the whoki country where the pipe was smoked. 

Captain Marcy refers to the Comauches being extravagantly fond 
of smoking tobacco, wliich they called pah-mo, mixed with the leaves of 
sumac' [lihus trilobata). 

Fig. 17 is a serpentine tube from Wilkes County, Geoigia, collected 
by Miss Fannie Andrews. It is 7 inches long, with a diameter of If 
inches at the widest part. This pipe is very similar in exterior as well 
as in interior finish to those so often found in the graves on the islands 
off the coast of California, and in shape differs in no essential from the 
bone pipe of the Kiowa and Comanche Indians. The tube of this pipe 
has been drilled its entire length by means of a solid drill point, the 
bowl and smaller end being subsequently enlarged by means of scrap- 
ing or gouging with a narrow tool, apparently made of stone, the 
striai of the drill point and gouge each being distinctly discernible. 
Similar specimens 
are quite common 
on the coast of Cal- 
ifornia, a few being 
known to have rude 
ornamentation of 
incised lines or de 
signs in low relief. 
A remarkable pecul- 
iarity of th i s Georgia 
pipe is shown in the 

three tracks, apparently of a bird, on the surface, traveling in a spiral 
direction from the bowl toward the mouthpiece. These three tracks 
are etched lightly into the stone and ])robably have some especial 
significance. Such tracks would indicate those of the turkey at Moki 
and the direction in which the smoke traveled to the mouth. Two 
similar tracks are figured in the cavity of a chunkee stone found in a 
mound at Belmont, near Camden, South Carolina, and represent one 
track on each side of the hole through the center of the stone.^ 

The enlargement of the smaller end of this tube is evidently for the 
purpose of inserting a mouthpiece of wood, or bone, or possibly even of 
stone. The California pipes had mouthpieces of bird bones held firmly 
in place with bitumen, similar to those of the cliff' dwellers which were 
held with gum of the greasewood. These mouthpieces served the pur- 
pose of preventing in a measure the tobacco or plant consumed from 
escaping into the smoker's mouth.

inches long, with a diameter of 1^ inches at the mouth of the bowl, 
which is circular in cross section, though ellii)tical at the middle, where 
the greatest diameter is 1^ inches. The bowl and stem are, however, 
not in the same plane, owing to having been drilled from opposite ends, 
the perforations being intended to intersect about the middle, at which 
point, as indicated in the figure, the wall has been perforated. Both 
bowl and stem ojieniugs have been enlarged subsequent to drilling by 
gouging. Into the stem a hollow bird bone, 1.^ inches long, fastened by 
means of bitumen, served as a mouthpiece. The perforation of the wall 
wouhl indicate that this was an unfinished article were it not for the 
mouthpiece, which indicates that this hole in some way was artificially 
closed, probably with the same bitumen with which the mouthpieces 
were held in place. The lower hole is perforated from side to side, and 
one would be inclined to suppose it was intended for the attachment of 
a string so commonly observed in certain types were it not that this 
appears to be a unique specimen among pipes of the type which belongs 

to those having a 
straight hole from 
end to end. This 
lateral hole is a 
natural cavity in 
the stone, the edges 
of which have been 
smoothed in grind- 
ing the surface. Its 
discovery in the 
blocking out of the 
pipe, which was al- 
ways done before boring the holes, has led to the curve in the specimen 
being made in order to preserve the cavity, which was evidently 
retained because of some superstition in connection with it, probably 
attaching unusual properties to the pipe itself. The California pipes are 
almost invariably elongated cones similar to the j)ipefrom Georgia (fig. 
17) and range in length from 3 to 10 inches. They were ordinarily made 
of serpentine, though specimens of talcose slate and steatite were found 
at La Patera and at Dos Pueblos.' The tobacco pipes of the natives 
of San Gabriel Mission, California, are said to have been made of reeds,^ 
from which their conical stone pipes would be a natural development. 

Yenegas (about 1758), referring to stone tubes being employed by the 
medicine men of California, says: "One mode was very remarkable, 
and the good effect it sometimes produced heightened tlie reputation of 
the physician. They applied to the suffering part of the patient's body 
the chacuaco" (presumably the conventional tube) "or a tube formed out 
of a very hard black stone. Through this they sometimes sucked and

at other times blew, but both as hard as they were able. Sometimes 
the tube was filled with cimarron, or wild tobacco, lighted"^ [Xicotiana

The same practice is referred to about 1766, while these same people 
were still living under primitive conditions. It was said "the priests 
never abandon the Californian, but on the contrary they redouble 
their cries, and they are heard on the whole raucheria when the sick- 
ness gets to the point where herbs, sweets, chichuaco and cimarron or 
wild tobacco no longer produce effect." - 

Professor Putnam's description of smoking by the Klamath Indians 
would probably apply equally to the smoking of the California or 
other tubular pipes. He says "it amused me to see an Indian bending 
back his head to bring the 
pipe in a vertical position, 
so as not to lose any to- 
bacco while taking a long 
draught, which he inhales 
the longer to enjoy the 
opportunity, as the pipe 
must be passed on."^ 

Dr. Greorge M. Dawson 
refers also to straight 
pipes of steatite, shaped very much like a cigar holder, which are 
marked with incised lines,found among the Shushwap people at the 
confluence of the Fraser and Thompson rivers in British Columbia.^ 

Fig. 19, it will be observed, was intended for a tubular pipe, and 
was found at Newport, Cook County, Tennessee, by Mr. J. W. Emmert. 
It is of a grayish serpentine, 4| inches long, with an exterior diameter 
of li inches at its thickest part. It is, however, an elongated, flattened 
elipsoidal cone, the raised rim of which is quite unusual and some- 
what ornamental. This specimen is in an unfinished condition and 
therefore doubly interesting, as it shows much of the process by which 
such pipes were made. The bowl has been excavated to a depth of 
barely Ih inches, and the stem hole is bored not over three-eighths of 
an inch, apparently by means of a stone drill, as the striae are quite 
irregular, though the cavity of the bowl has been enlarged subsequent 
to drilling by a sharp-pointed tool, which left longitudinal marks 
similar to those so commonly noticed in specimens found in the States 
along the Middle Atlantic as far west certainly as the Mississippi 
River, along the Missouri, and in the Rocky Mountains. The common 
drill point of the California coast appears to differ from those used in 
the East, the former being made of a gritty stone of ovoid shape,

several fine specimens of which, some still showing the asphaltum by 
which they were attached to the drill shaft, are preserved in the Ameri- 
can Museum of Natural History in ^ew York City. The surface of 
this specimen shows distinctly both the circular and the longitudinal 
striae of the stone or shell scraper with which the form has been given. 
Pipes of this type with few exceptions, so far as the writer has observed, 
have been drilled by means of solid drills, though, as showing that 
there are exceptions at times, Thruston ^ illustrates one partially exca- 
vated which was bored by means of a 
hollow drill. 

Fig. 20, though a tubular pipe, dif- 
fers materially in shape from the usual 
California type. This one is from Santa 
Barbara, and was collected by Paul 
Schumacher, its length being 3 inches, 
with a diameter varying from three- 
fourths of an inch to 1^ inches. This 
tube is made from a clayey substance 
quite as soft as chalk; in color it is a light pink, and the specimen 
might well be taken for pottery by a casual observer, or even for catli- 
nite. Mr. Stephen Powers states that the Mshinani Indians of Bear 
Eiver, California, smoke a wild tobacco called by Prof. Asa Gray 
NicoUana quadrivalvis, and by Professor Bolander N. plumhaginifolia^ 
which they use alone or mixed with the leaves of manzanita (Arcto- 
staphylos glauca). Mr. A. W. Chase says the Klamaths cultivate it, 
which is the only instance of California cultivation. He says the pipe 
pan-em-ku-lah is generally made of 
serpentine (of wood nowadays), shaped 
like a cigar.^ 

Prof. J. T. Kothrock obtained from 
the shell mounds in California a to- 
bacco, probably the NicoUana cleve- 
landi, and says the N. rustica (now 
rare) was formerly cultivated there. 
In Arizona they cultivated the iV. ta- 
hacum, known as Ya(iui tobacco, and 

refers to Gray's saying that JV. quadrivalvis was cultivated from Oregon 
to Missouri. He also calls attention to the Hudson's Bay men using 
the dried leaves of the bear berry to eke out the supply of tobacco. ' 

Fig. 21 is a sandstone pipe 3 inches long, having a greatest diameter 
of slightly more than an inch. It is from Frankfort, Kentucky, and 
was collected by Dr. Robert Peter. This tube has been bored through 
by a one-half inch drill; for approximately 2 inches of its length the

perforation has been enlarged to form a bowl by the usual gouging 
process the length of the interior. The smaller end of this tube is 
too large to be comfortably held in the mouth unless it had a mouth- 
piece of bone, such as was inserted in the California tubes. It is, 
however, verj- noticeable in primitive pipes, even such as were appar- 
ently held in the smoker's mouth, that it is rare to observe any evi- 
dence of wear such as would be caused by the smoker's teeth comiug 
in contact with the surface of the stem. The action of fire upon the 
inner surface of this tube is quite distinct. 

Fig. 22, from Uan River, Virginia, collected by Dr. A. Coleman, is a 
conical tube of primitive pottery 3 inches loug, the larger end being 
approximately 2 inches across and the smaller end slightly more than 
1| inches in diameter. The clay from which this tube was made has 
been mixed with coarse quartz sand, a tempering material not uncom- 
mon in aboriginal pottery in the eastern central i>arts of the United 
States. The walls of this tnbe are un- 
usually heavy in comparison with those 
of similar ones of stone, they being about 
three-eighths of an inch thick, and show 
the cord marks in the pottery quite dis- 
tinctly. A tube very similar to the one 
here figured, but slightly curved in its 
longitudinal section, was found near Fig. 22.

found, at a depth of 6 feet, in a shell 

heap on the upper St. Johns River, Florida, an earthenware pipe over 
7 inches long in the form of a bent, flattened tube.^ The character- 
istics of this latter tube are very much like those of the Bennings 
Bridge specimens, and there can be little doubt that all of tbem are 
tobacco pipes, the pottery having every indication of age. Tubular 
pipes have also been noted in Rhode Island, and Perkins refers to 
them in Champlain Valley, Vermont.^ 

Abbott also refers to a tubular smoking pipe from Lawrence, Massa- 
chusetts, which he says differs in no ijarticular from those found in 
California.-' 

The almost endless variety of material from which pipes were made 
is shown in the case of the Micmac Indians of Nova Scotia, who '* some- 
times used tobacco pipes made of birch bark, rolled in the form of a 
cone, and which, of course, are perishable."* A tube of this character 
from a mound in Heuderson County, Illinois, made from a brown 
iudurated clay, is in the collection of the U. S. National Museum.

Bartow County, Georgia. 

U.S.National Museum. Collected by Roland Stein. 



Fig. 23 belongs to another and distinct type of stone tubes and was 
found in the Etowah Mound, Bartow County, Georgia, and is in the 
Steiner collection now on deposit in the U. S. National Museum. This 
object is as symmetrical in outline as it is perfect in finish; stem and 
bowl, both outside and inside, are eiiually well and carefully ground; 
the walls are. approximately, one-eighth of an inch in thickness through- 
out. The specimen is 2^ inches long, the bowl being 1^ inches in outer 
diameter and the stem live-eighths of an inch. It appears probable 

that we have here the form of the medi- 
cine pipe referred to by so many of the 
early writers, or is it but a freak of the na- 
tive tobacco pipe? Coreal says they do 
not resort to bleeding when they are sick, 
as is done elsewhere, but call in their jaou- 
ans, who are priests and doctors. These 
suck that part of the body which is most 
painful, at times with the mouth, also 
with the chalumeau, after making a slight 
incision near a vein.' 
Coreal, relating his experiences between 1666 and 1697, is one of the 
earliest writers who employed the word chalumeau, a reed, in referring 
to the pipe. It is said to be a word of Norman origin and the one from 
which "calumet" is derived. A similar specimen to that in the Steiner 
collection is in the U. S. National Museum, and was found by Capt. C. E. 
Bendire on the John Day River, California. 

Fig. 24 is a comparatively modern California pottery pipe 3^ inches 
long, with a diameter of five-eighths of an inch at the mouth of the bowl. 
Except that both bowl and stem are longer, there are retained in this 
specimen all of the character- 
istics of the Pueblo pipe of a 
very primitive period, for 
theTe can be little doubt that 
the California j)ipe and that 
of the Indians south of Cal- 
ifornia are nearly related, the 
former probably adoj)ting the 
custom from their southern contemporaries, as the general distribution 
appears to have gradually traveled northward. This pipe has elegance 
of form, and the clay from which it is made is of very smooth texture, 
the walls of the bowl not being more than one-sixteenth of an iiicb 
thick. A Mojave pottery pipe of this character is in the Davenport 
Academy. The writer is informed by Dr. Franz Boas that there is a 
pipe of this type made of green serpentine in the American Museum of 
Natural History, New York, obtained from the Fraser River Indians.

AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 391 

Lewis and Clarke iu 1804: describe a pipe which Avas possibly of this 
type, found ampng the Shoshonees, which was "made of a dense trans- 
parent green stone, very highly polished, about 2^ inches long and of 
an oval figure, the bowl being in the same situation with the stem. A 
small i)iece of burnt clay is placed in the bottom of the bowl to separate 
the tobacco from the end of the stem, and is of an irregular round fig- 
ure, not fitting the tube perfectly close, in order that the smoke may 
pass with facility.'" 

The Indians of northern California, according to Prof. Otis T. IMason, 
formerly smoked a wild tobacco, Xicotiana quadrivalvis (Pursh) X. phim- 
baginifolia, which they smoked alone or mixed with the dry mauzanita 
leaves, Arctostaphylos (jlauca, said to have a pungent, pepper^' taste 
which is not disagieeable. The pipes of the Hupa are, as Professor 
Mason says, conoidal in shape, and are of wood alone, stone alone, or 
latterly of stone and wood combined.- 

While it is impossible to speak with certainty of the antiquity of the 
tobacco pipe in California, it may be said that the large collection in 
the U. S. Xational Museum from that State api^ears to be contempora- 
neous with the early arrivals of Europeans, probably Spanish, if. we 
may form an estimate from those things found iu the graves in asso- 
ciation with them, such as glass beads, bird-bone whistles and flutes. 
The tubular pipes, it has been attempted to demonstrate, are found 
scattered over a large part of the continent, and they were quite com- 
monly smoked by means of stems fastened into an enlargement in the 
smaller end, though there are evidences that at times these tubes were 
smoked without stems. Their shapes vary greatly, from tubes made 
of reeds, having, of course, parallel walls, to conical specimens more or 
less elongated ; we may say from a foot or more to 3 inches or less in 
length. Schumacher found iu the collection of the U. S. National 
Museum a tubular conical pipe from Oregon (Cat. Xo. 20339, TJ.S.X.M.), 
which is in an unfinished condition, having been drilled several inches 
from one end with a five-eighths inch hole, while from the opposite end 
a hole slightly less in diameter has been made. A tube of the hour- 
glass form (Cat. Ifo. 170477, U.S.X.M.) from South Carolina has been 
bored, so far as one can see, in exactly the same manner. The perfo- 
rated articles of primitive peoples will almost always be found drilled 
from opposite sides, due to there being less friction in this method and 
consequent greater ease in drilling than when the work is all done from 
one end. 

Fig. 25 is simply a cone cut apparently from mauzanita wood. It is 
13 inches long with a greatest diameter of 2 inches, tapering gradually 
to 1^ inches at the smaller end. If this pipe were sawed in two one-

appears to have been perforated by burning. The walls vary from one-

an inch at the larger. The outer sides appear to have been smoothed 
by means of sandpajjer, though the same appearance could be imparted 
to the specimen with any gritty sandstone or with sand alone. These 
pil)es are made from any available wood, those which best resist fire 
being preferred, one of the best and most usual being the laurel.

that is of peculiar form. The bowl is 2i inches in greatest diameter, 
that of the stem being scarcely three-fourths of an inch thick. The 
bowl cavity consists of quite a shallow cup, the specimen having been 
rudely chopped out by means of an extremely dull tool, which gives 
one the impression that it would be a difiicult pipe to smoke unless the 
smoker laid flat on his back.

usually are, tliey would have had bowls alike, though among the Hupa, 
to a greater degree thau has been detected among other natives, pipes 
have been made of a greater variety in shape than has been observed 
to be the case with almost any other type with which we are acquainted. 
They appear to be comparatively modern, and it is strongly to be 
suspected that the 
multiform shape of 
the Hupa pipe has 
been largely iniiu- 
enced by the outside 
demand for speci- 
mens as curiosities. 
There is in no imple- 
ment found in America a greater observance of conventionalism of 
form thau is the case among the pipes, and in those localities where the 
greatest variety exists investigation demonstrates that the smoking 
habit itself has been adopted within the last century. These varie- 
ties are most marked along the Pacific 
coast among the Hupa and Babeens. 

Fig. 28 is a fine-grained tubular sand- 
stone, showing unusual mechanical skill 
in its manufacture, being 7 inches long, 
with a diameter at the larger end of three- 
fourths of an inch; the walls of the tube 
do not exceed one-sixteenth of an inch at 
the mouth of the bowl, increasing gradually to one-eighth inch at the 
smaller end. The outer surface is ground to a dull polish, and the inte- 
rior shows striae running the length of the implement, made apparently 
by means of a file or similar tool. 
Fig. 29 differs in no material re- 
spect from the simplest form of 
conical tubes found throughout the 
continent, except in the slightly 
raised rim around the smaller end. 
It is made of steatite, and has a 
length of 2f inches. This rim is 
similar to one on the bowl of the unfinished pipe from Cook County, 
Tennessee (fig. 19), and would indicate that it was intended simply for 
ornament and not for the attachment of a string. 

Fig. 30 is of wood, being the pipe used by the Hupas at the present 
time, and is 3 inches long, with a greatest diameter of three-fourths of 
an inch, the bowl being about seven-eighths of an inch deep, from which 
there runs a narrow stem hole to the smaller end. 

Fig. 31 shows the shape of the tobacco bag of these people, and is 
made from strips of the roots of the spruce, split into strings and woven 
together; six buck.skin loops are attached to its rim in such a manner

that tlieir apices meet iu the center of the opening. A long string is 
attached to one loop and is serially passed through all the others, by- 
means of which ttie bag may be opened and closed at will by drawing 

the loops apart or by drawing the string. 
This bag would be found to differ little, 
except in material, throughout the conti- 
nent. Some would make it of skin, while 
others would weave it from suitable 
fibers, and others again would ijrobably 
fashion it from birch bark. 

Fig. 32 is a wooden pipe, 11 inches 
long, the bowl of which is made in the 
hourglass form, similar in outline to cer- 
tain tubes found in the Middle Atlantic 
States. The bowl has been cut with a 
dull tool, but upon the stem are a number 
of crossed lines, intended to add to its 
ornamental appearance. Fig. 33 is made 
of hard wood, the bowl of which is carved in a series of octagons, cham- 
fers, and holes, which give to this specimen quite an ornamental effect. 
The tube is 12^ inches long, the bowl being seven-eighths of an inch in 
its greatest exterior diameter, and has a cavity 2 inches deep. Figs. 34

manufacture. A close iuspectiou developed the fact, however, that 
the cavity was a natural formation, which had contained a cephalopod, 
a species of cystoceras. The circular cavity shows a succession of 
wavy parallel striae, which have every appearance of being made with 
a drill, which, however it would be impossible to give with any primi- 
tive implement, and it may well be doubted whether it could be done

with the most improved modern tools. While the bowl has the conoidal 
shape common to tubular pipes, one side is flat, while the other is 
rounded. It has a length of 2^ inches with a width of If inches, and 
is much harder than stone from which pipes are usually made. Around 
the flat side of this tube, where it apparently is attached to a base, a 
slight groove has been evidently artificially made to enhance the 
appearance; a most excellent illustration of the Indian's attraction to 
unusual shapes in natural objects. 

The native American, however, does not appear to be alone iu smok- 
ing straight tubular pipes, for Flinders, iu the early part of the century, 

is quoted as referring to a tribe of Papuans 
puffing smoke through tubes.' 

The natives of Sankum River, Africa, in 
about 5° south latitude, are said to use bone 
pipes, made from the metatarsal bones of 
deer,2 similar to those referred to in this 
paper of Kiowa and Comanche origin. 

It has been commonly supposed that to 
make a stone pipe required weeks if not 
months of j)atient labor. The writer has, 
however, demonstrated that with primitive 
tools, picking, grinding, and drilling, almost 
any pipe, such as those which have been used by American Indians, 
could be completed in less than three days' work aud the more ordinary 
ones in a few hours. Instances of the discovery of conical tubes in 
different States and Territories could be multiplied were it necessary, 
but it is believed a sufficient number of illustrations have been given 
to Impart a fair idea of the type. There appears no room to doubt

that the tubular and couoidal pipe is comparatively common through- 
out the continent and that it is the most primitive of all forms, as it is 
the one found over the largest area of the continent, it being also the 
type upon which there are the least evidences of file marks. Among 
all tubular pipes which have come under the writer's observation the 
mark of the file appears only once, and in that instance it is upon a 
small surface of a glossy specimen which may well be modern. 

The surfaces of tubular pipes, with scarcely an. exception, have every 
appearance of being made with stone tools, excepting, of course, the 
Hui)a pipe. The drill marks in tubular pipes have also every indica- 
tion of beiug made with primitive tools, and it is the only type found 
in the country upon which steel tool marks do not appear with such 
frequency as to indicate the contemporaneity of the white man ; not 
of necessity that he made them, but that tbey were made with tools 
supplied by him. The shape itself of many of the American Indian 
tubes is such, and their ornamentation is of a character to lead to the 
conclusion that they are due to European intluences. The aboriginal 
mechanic made at one bound a wonderful stride when he first became 
possessed of a blade of 
iron, even though it were 
but the hoop of a barrel ;

throughout the known 

world has been chiefly due to the discovery of improved tools, which 
have limited possibilities. AVith the stone-pecking tool carving was 
possible, but slow, while sculpture in free action was an impossibility, 
because of the jar of the working tool. An attempt at the rein-esenta- 
tion of free action is first found to be successful when the bronze blade 
supplanted the stone hammer, and statues were made from the softest 
stones, instead of from the granites and diorites which had preceded 
them. The steel blade and the rasp made the sculpture of marble in the 
round with free action first possible. Is it probable that the American 
Indian, alone of all the races of the earth, formed so startling an excep- 
tion as to have carved perfectly in the round and to have had no period 
of rude art? The Indian was quick to appreciate and to employ tools 
which so materially lightened the labors of life as did those made of iron. 
Fig. 39 is a tube of the hourglass pattern, collected by Mr. J. Var- 
den, from Nashville, Tennessee. With few exceptions, these tubes 
are made from steatite, and are more smoothly ground than is usually 
the case with conoidal i)ipes, and show a higher appreciation of art. 
They vary in length from 5 to 14 inches, with an exterior diameter of 




398 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

from 1^ to 2 inches, the interior of the tube being one-third of an inch, 
or even less, across. 

The tube figured is 6 inches long with a greatest diameter of 2 
inches, gradually diminishing to 1^ inches. The contractions of these 
tubes often have bauds encircling them, made at times in imitation of 
a rope or cord. Sometimes there are two or even three bands of dif- 
ferent widths, intended apparently as ornamentation. The perfora- 
tions are comparatively straight iu these hourglass tubes, though 
there is a cast of a specimen in the U. S. National Museum which, upon 
the exterior, shows a decided curve. The curve once given to a tubular 
pipe, whether accidentally or by design, would be quickly recognized 
as an improvement upon the straight tube, thereby enabling one to 
smoke it with less discomfort than would necessarily result from the 
use of a straight pipe. It is difficult to believe that the white man, 
who has traded in stone implements from the time of John Smith's first 
voyage to the present day, did not also trade in pipes, especially as 
they, of all his possessions, appear to have been the objects for which 
the Indian had the greatest veneration and to which he attached the 
greatest value, and consequently for which he would pay the most 
liberal prices. The numbers of trade pipes found in Indian burial 
places strongly attest the extent to which the trade between the 
whites and the Indians eventually extended. There is scarcely an 
account of a treaty between whites and Indians in which the pipe and 
tobacco tongs do not appear. among the presents exchanged, and there 
are records of " great pipes " being presented, by both French and Eng- 
lish governors, to their red allies as symbols of amity and pledges of 
good will. As noted in reference to other tubes, those of the hourglass 
form appear to have been originally drilled by means of solid i)oints, 
the perforation being subsetiuently enlarged by gouging out each 
end, and leaving a narrow hole or channel connecting the two bowls 
or ends. These tubes have been suj>posed to have served among other 
purposes as astronomical instruments, a suggestion hardly deserving 
serious consideration. This type, the writer thinks, were emj^loyed as 
pipes, a belief iu which many now concur. It appears that tubular 
pipes were not invariably smoked by placing the smaller end in the 
mouth, for Dr. Fewkes found the Moki Indians lighting conical pipes 
and placing the larger end to the mouth, blowing smoke through the 
smaller end until the lighted material was consumed. When it is 
remembered how persistently customs are handed down among the 
Indians, and particularly pipe customs, or quasi-religious invocations, 
which are conducted by societies of men whose function is to act in 
conformity with traditional rituals, we can well believe that similar 
implements, even in remote antiquity, were put to like uses. The 
resemblance of pipe customs from the most widely separate parts of 
the continent appear to attest the auti(iuity of the practices. 

The interiors of the hourglass tyj^e of tubes and of many of the

conoidal pipes are so alike in their uaiiow ueck or point of contraction 
about tlieir centers as to suggest the likelihood of the plant smoked 
causing the fire to fall into the smoker's mouth, especially when it is 
considered that the tube almost of necessity had to be held perpendicu- 
larly in smoking. 

Fig. 40, said to come from a mound near Ashland, Kentucky, belongs 
to the typical tubular hourglass type. It is now in the collection of Mr. 
A. E. Douglass, of Xew York City. It is 9 inches long, the bowl outside 
being If inches wide. It must be admitted that this pipe, from an artis- 
tic point of view, evidences a step in advance in ornamentation beyond 
anything heretofore 
observed in connec- 
tion with American 
stone tubes of any 
kind. Upon this 
tube we see a wood 
duck facing the stem, 
which is well mod- 
eled and shows dis- 
tinctly the bird's 
crest and two depres- 
sions for the eyes, 
which there can be 
little doubt were in- 
tended for the inser- 
tion of artificial eyeballs. The wings of the bird are crossed over the 
back, and its tail is so modeled as to represent a frog facing the bowl, 
the bird's legs answering for those of the frog. This singular composite 
figure, it must be admitted, is a most remarkable occurrence if it belongs 
to pure savage art, which the writer believes to be an impossibility. 
From the base of the tube to the top of the duck's head the measure- 
ment is 4 inches, the band being three fourths of an inch in width. The 
bowl of this tube, which is behind the duck, has an opening 1^ inches 
across and a depth of If inches, at which point it contracts to a tube 
one-half an inch in diameter, which for a distance of 4 inches is of uni- 
form size; then it begins to expand gradually until it reaches a diameter 
of 1 inch at the opposite end. Another tube of this type is referred to by 
Squier and Davis as being found in a mound near the Catawba River, 
Chester district. South Carolina, upon which a well carved owl is attached 
by the back, showing a bold and spirited piece of sculpture practically 
in the round.' 

Thruston also figures a tube with a wood duck upon it, sitting quite 
at one end, and without an encircling band.' 

The wood duck and owl are found constantly represented upon rec- 
tangular pipes in the territory of the tubes of hourglass form.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 




Fig. 4:1 presents yet auother peculiar divergence from the usual tubu- 
lar pipe. This specimen is 9 inches long, the greatest diameter being 
2f inches, and is from Williams Island, Tennessee, and was collected 
by Mr. J. B, Nicklin. The interior of the tube contracts and expands 
as does that of tig. 40. The bowl and stem are both enlarged by the 
usual longitudinal gimging. The opening at the smaller end of this 
tube is similar in character to that noticed in the stems of the California 
pipes, and appears to have been intended for the insertion of a stem of 
wood. Upon this tube lies stretched out the head and neck of a dog or 
wolf, fairly well modeled. On the sides of the bowl are rudely scratched 
into the serpentine, of which it is made, two totemic figures, one to the 
right and the other to the left of the animal's nose, so rudely executed 

that it is impossible 
to say for what they 
are intended, though 
one appears to repre- 
sent the skin of some 
bird or animal. Be- 
tween the ears of the 
animal are observ- 
able a series of par- 
allel scratches, ap- 
parently made with 
a iile, though the rest 
of the implement presents no surface which could not be duplicated 
with stone tools. The design of this pipe is more artistic than most of 
the hand work of savages, though the totems lightly scratched into the 
surface appear to be the work of another school from that which carved 
the remainder, the one and the other differing radically in technique. 
The writer has detected upon the surface of a number of the stone pipes 
in the collections of the XJ. S. National Museum totemic characters etched 
into the stone with some sharp-pointed tool, and they are invariably 
extremely rude efforts to represent some animal or object; so rude are 
these etchings that they arouse a grave doubt in the writer's mind as 
to whether they could have been made by a people who were capable of 
delineating animal form with the skill shown in the sculpture of many 
of the American pipes. Even though it be admitted that there were 
skilled artisans who made the pipes, and that the slight surface etch- 
ings were individual totems or marks, the suspicion remains that the 
sharp parallel, equidistant, straight lines so common on all sculptured 
or carved pipes are evidences of the use of the tile of the white man. 

If aboriginal trade in stone implements made by the whites was of 
such value as to justify John Smith in asking permission of Powhatan 
to go through his country to obtain material from which to make axes, 
how much more valuable would be the trade in ornamented pipes; and 
can one doubt that the whites indnlged in it extensively, unless it be

aryued that tlie Datives possesseil superior capacity in manufacturiug 
tbeiii '? The characteristics of the etclied totemic figures are not iu 
accord with the pipe carvings. The one shows gross ignorance of out- 
line, the other tlie skill of an artist, Bartrani refers to "the skin of a 
wild-cat or young tiger laid at the king's feet with the great or royal 
pipe, beautifully adorned. The skin," he says, "is usually of the animals 
of the king's family or tribe, as the wild cat, otter, or bear, rattlesnake, 
etc."i 

The last pipe referred to is related to a well-defined tyi)e of rectangu- 
lar pipes, which, except that they are found too far to the south, would 
well answer to a des(;ription of the pipes to which John Smith referred 
as being "three quarters of a yard long, prettily carved with a bird, a 
bear, a deer, or some such device at the great end," and " sufficient 
to beat out the brains of a man."'^ Strachey refers to them as being 
sufficient to beat out the "braynes of a horse." ^ Baguall, Powell, and 
Todkill increase the length of this pipe to 3 feet.'* 

EARLY REFERENCES TO THE USE OF TOBACCO. 

Prescott says, " Tobacco was among the products of Peru, yet the 
Peruvians differed from every other nation to whom it was known, by 
using it only for medicinal purposes in the fn-ni of snuff'." "^ 

The Inca Garcillasco de la Yega does not appear to refer to smoking, 
but only to the using of snuff". ^ 

"Tabaco," according to Oviedo, "was a certain instrument of wood 
or cane made in the manner of the Greek r,of which the Indians accom- 
modate the two upper canes to the openings of the nose for the inhal- 
ing of the smoke of a plant which they call Cohiba or Cojiba," which is 
also called to-day by the name of that instrument." 

He, like others, says their " fumigation " was for the purpose of get- 
ting intoxicated. 

Dr. A. Ernst concludes, after a most careful consideration of the 
text, that Oviedo never saw an Indian using the little implement he 
describes, and shows that "taboca" is the correct name for an imple- 
ment which is still used by several tribes in South America. It is 
made of one of the long bones of the tapir, through which the Muras 
and Mauhos of the Amazon reciprocally blow into each other's nos- 
trils the parica. Another exj)lanatiou agrees with Las Casas; that

"cahoba" was the name, not ouly of the powder, but also of the cere- 
mony of taking the powder.' 

According to Fairholt, this figure of the pipe does not occur in the 
earlier editions of Oviedo, the cut being copied from the Salamanca 
edition of 154:7.- 

Purchas, about 1G26, quaintly describes this tube referred to by 
Oviedo; alluding to the native,s of Hispaniola, who, he says, "had 
tobacco in religious estimation, not only for a sanity, but for sanctity 
also, as Oviedo writeth, the smoke whereof they took into the nose 
with a forked pipe fitted to both nostrils, holding the single end in the 
smoke of that herb burning in the fire until they be(;ame senseless. 
Their priests most used this, who, coming to themselves after this 
sleepy fume, delivered the oracles of their zemes or devils, which some- 
times spake by them." ^ 

Dr. Max Uhle, of the Museum of Science and Art of the University 
of Pennsylvania, has written a most interesting paper on snuffing 
tubes,^ and to him my thanks are due for the illustration shown in fig. 2. 

Latitau, speaking of this habit, says that "after they tumble down, 
deprived of all feeling, they are carried away in their hammocks by 
their wives." ^ 

Southey refers to certain tribes of the Rio Negro "who have an 
extraordinary and tremendous ceremony, for which a large house is set 
apart in all their villages. It begins by a general flogging of one 
another with a thong and stone at the end. This continues eight days, 
during which the old women, who among the American savages officiate 
at most works of abomination, roast the fruit of the parica tree and 
reduce it to a fine i)owder. The parties who had been paired in the 
previous discipline are partners also in the following part, each in turn 
blowing this powder with great force through a hollow cane into the 
nostrils of his friend. They then commence drinking and the eflect of 
the drink and the deleterious powder is such that most of them lose 
their senses for a time and many lose their lives. The ceremony lasts 
sixteen days, and is called the feast of the parica." ^ 

Condamine, according to McCulloh, says the Omaguas, on the upper 
waters of the Amazon, snuff up a powder, which they call there "car- 
rupa," by means of a forked hollow stick, the forked end being inserted 
in the nostrils. He says that the intoxication which follows this prac- 
tice lasts twenty-four hours.^

Humboldt lefers to the same habit among tlie Otomacs, whom, he 
says, " gather the long pods of a mimosacea, cut them in i^ieces, moisten 
them, and cause them to ferment, mixed with the flour of cassava and 
hme, procured from the shell of a helix. The whole mass is exposed to 
a brisk fire. When it is to be used, it is redu(;ed to a very fine powder 
and placed in a dish; he holds the dish in his right hand and inhales 
the niopo by the nose, through a forked bone of a bird, the two extrem- 
ities of which are applied to the nostrils. This bone, without which the 
Otomac believes he could not take this kind of snuff, is 7 inches long. 
It appeared to me to be the leg bone of a large sort of a plover. Father 
Gumilla says 'this diabolical powder of the Otomacs, furnished by an 
arborescent tobacco plant [Orinoco illus.), intoxicates them by the nos- 
trils; deprives them of reason, and renders them furious in battle.'"^ 

Nadaillac says, "Another Spanish historian tells us that the natives 
of Hispaniola, to the great astonishment of the Spanish, placed a tube 
with two openings in their nose, in order to lose none of the aroma of 
the precious plant." ^ He further informs us, quoting Clavigero, who 
lived in Mexico in 1775, "that the Aztecs gave to tobacco the name 
•• pycietl,' which they were not satisfied to smoke in the shape of cigar- 
ettes wrapped in corn leaves, but also inserted it in fine powder in their 
noses. The powder thus employed served to clear the head, and its 
virtue was so highly appreciated in Spain that it was called the 'sacred 
herb.' " '' 

Herrera says of the Venezuelans, "They also use much tobacco for 
rheumatism, humors, and pains in the head. They take it through the 
nose mashed into powder; they drink the juice, and it makes a purge; 
and it is also used by the Spaniards." ^ 

These references make it conclusive that the Y-like implement 
referred to by Oviedo is identical with the bifurcated bird bone 
referred to by Baron Humboldt, or the bone of a tapir as suggested 
by Dr. Ernst, the only one known to the writer. is in the Museum of 
the University of Pennsylvania, made from the l-^g bone of a llama. 
The evidence, however, appears plain that Oviedo made no mistake 
in attributing to the tube the properties of a pipe, a view f'ully sus- 
tained by Monardes. 

The habit of using snuff appears to have been one of the pecul- 
iarities of the j)eople of South America, who, so far as available writ- 
ings indicate, did not smoke the pipe; and it is extremely dcmbtful if 
they smoked at all until the i)ractice was introduced about the time of 
the Conquest of Mexico by the Spanish; nor does the smoking habit

ai)pear to have prevailed iu the northwestern part of North America 
from any very early period, but seems to have been introduced from 
Japan by way of Siberia, if we may Judge from the form of the pipes. 
How and where the smoking habit originated must remain largely a 
matter of conjecture. The effect on the system of tobacco smoking is 
sedative as well as stimulating, and the belief iu its sup])osed medicinal 
properties is yet by no means obsolete either among the Indians or 
the whites. As McCulloh tersely remarks, "smoking among the rude 
Indians of Korth America became the pledge of their hospitality, like 
the salt of the Arab." ' The use of tobacco and other plants, smoked 
in tubes or pipes, on the northern continent is most intimately asso- 
ciated with the life history of tlie Indian, not only as a sovereign 
remedy for most human ailments, but as a necessary function in all 
ceremonies, whether of the individual, of the clan, the tribe, or the 
confederacy. The hunter smoked to bring him game, the traveler to 
bring him a successful end to his journey, those on the water offered 
tobacco to the water to quiet the waves, or, if on land, to propitiate 
the winds which Avere the living evidences of good or evil creatures, 
and the smoking of the pipe throughout the whole of what is now 
the territory of the United States became souiething more than a flag 
of truce, for it was an evidence of friendship and its smoke the symbol 
of the spirit world. The practice of chewing tobacco was tirst noticed 
on the coast of South America by the Spaniards in 1502,^ but does not 
appear to have been indulged in to any general extent elsewhere among 
the natives. 

There appears to be no positive evidence of the extent to which the 
early Spanish settlers cultivated the tobacco plant, but that tlieir first 
plantations were largely devoted to its growth there is no doubt. 

Cigarettes and cigars among the Spanish-American peoples are 
employed almost to the exclusion of the pipe, and it may well be that 
such was the custom of those countries occupied by them from a time 
antedating the Spanish invasion. 

As late as 1731 John Cockburn says that throughout New Spain 
there was " no such thing as a tobacco pipe, but poor awkward tools 
used by negroes and Indians."-' 

Wherever we find the tobacco plant mentioned in early chronicles it 
is invariably spoken of as possessed of remarkable medicinal i)roperties, 
and this view of it was indorsed as late as the tirst half of the seven- 
teenth century by the medical fraternity of the whole of Europe. 

The Inca (Jarcillasso de la Vega (1688) says: "The herb or plant 
which the Spaniards call tobacco and the Indians sayri is of admirable 
use iu many diseases amongst them; particularly. being taken at the

nostrils in siiutt" serves to purge the bead, and the other virtues of it 
are well known and esteemed in Spain, so that they give it the name of 
Yerba Sdncta,''^ or Herbe Sainte, according to Labat.'- 

Herrera refers to tobacco in Peru as a medicinal herb called piccietl, 
"which stops pains brought on by colds, and taken in the form of a 
smoke is a cure for rheumatism, asthma, and colds, and the Indians 
and negroes carry it in their mouths, which makes them sleep, and so 
that they will not feel fatigued."^ 

IJlloa says that m the early part of the last century Lima's commerce 
consisted largely of snuff. " The merchants dealing in it sell only per- 
fumes, such as amber, musk," etc.^ 

Dr. von Ihering doubts that the Chileans knew of tobacco and smoked 
the same out of pipes before the arrival of the Spanish; though we are 
told that in each temple there are two figures in relief, or two statues 
with black beaks, before which they continually burn the wood of certain 
trees of the country which have a very sweet odor.' 

It is undoubted that, although the smell of burning tobacco is objec- 
tionable to- many people, there are others who find it most agreeable, 
the matter being to a great extent one of education. 

Thomas Man, an Englishman, in 1(302, called the plant tobacco, 
though Dr. Monardes, a Spanish writer, employed the term as early as 
1571. The French, as early as their first voyage to Montreal (about 
l(i5(>), called tobacco i)etun, a term by which they referred to it for a long 
period. The word is sometimes spelled petum. Petun was, according 
to Fairholt, the word used by De Bry and "Herbe La Reine" was 
employed by Jean Neander, of Leyden, as also by Herba Legati." 
Romano Pane, a Spanish priest, sent back by Columbus during his 
second voyage to Hispaniola, in De Insularum Ritibus {l-i91), speaks of 
a medicinal and religious plant, an herba inebrians, cohoba, cohobba, 
or giva. By whatever terms tobacco has been called, the words 
"tobacco" and "petun" are the two from which all other languages 
api)ear to have selected the name for this plant. 

Knevet, about l.^iO^i, speaks of the natives of the West Indies as 
"mighty takers of tobacco," and think it not only the best thing- their 
country produces, but one of the greatest necessaries of life; for besides 
its use ill smoking and chewing thej^ practice all their chirurgery with 
it and apply that alone in case of any hurt whatever.'

406 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

All available evidence tends to contradict tlie supposition that tlie 
peoples of the West Indies or of South and Central America possessed 
l^ipes, and the excavations among the graves and ruins of these peoples, 
which have been quite extensive, have not disclosed a single specimen 
so far as the writer has been able to discover. In the U. S. National 
Museum there are w<mderfully rich collections of pottery and stone 
implements from Porto Eico,the Bahama Islands, Mcaragua, Costa Rica, 
and Chiriqui, yet none of them contain a single article which resembles 
a pipe of any form. 

Conventional forms appear to govern the shapes of pipes in contigu- 
ous territory through the whole northern continent, the tubular shape, 
as befoie observed, being the only exception to the rule. The geograph- 
ical distribution of the best-known types of pipes is so pronounced that 
a specimen of any one of them may be assigned to its proper area with 
little risk of mistake. 

The curing of tobacco appears seldom to have been referred to by 
early writers, though Benzoni, according to H. Ling Roth, says : " When 
the leaves are in season they pick them, tie them up in bundles and sus- 
pend them near the fireplace until they are very dry, and when they wish 
to use them they take a leaf of their grain (iftaize) and putting one of 
the others into it they roll them round tight together; then they set fire 
to one end and putting the other into the mouth they draw their breath 
up through it and they retain it as long as they can, * * * and so 
much do they fill themselves with this cruel smoke that they lose their 
reason ; and some there are who take so much of it that they fall down 
as if they were dead and remain the greater part of the day or night 
stupefied."' The curing here described is not dissimilar to the present 
approved method among tobacco cultivators. 

The Mexicans, in sending ambassadors, according to all of the Span- 
ish writers of the sixteenth century, exhibit a custom strikingly like 
those of the northern Indians in similar ceremonies. De Solis says: 
" In the right hand they bore a large arrow with the feathers up on 
high, and on the left arm a target made of shell. The intent of the 
embassy was known by the feathers of the arrow, for the red denoted 
war and the white denoted peace.'" 

Prescott says that "tobacco (in Mexican yetl), is derived from a Hay- 
tien word, ' tabaco.'"^ There is too little known of how far the Mexicans 
used tobacco for the assertion to be made that it " did not possess the 
peculiar character attached to it by the North American Indians as an 
indis])ensable accessory to treaties, the cementing of friendships, etc., 
but was indulged in cliiefly by the sick as a pastime and for its stimu- 
lating effect, and after dinner in the form of paper, reed, or maize-leaf

Cigarettes called pocyetl, smoking tobacco, or aeayetl, tobacco reed, the 
leaf beinji' well mixed in a paste, etc."^ 

The habit of smoking was not sufticiently well known to Europeans 
to be described by any uniform formula, tobacco itself being called by 
many names and the pipe having as many more. The practice was, liow- 
ever, apparently a common one, employed by the medicine man to draw 
out or drive in pain. It nmy be said that for a century after its intro- 
duction into Europe physicians prescribed it in a manner as foolishly 
as did the Indians, for it was considered a specific for every known dis- 
ease. The etllect produced on the iudividnal by smoking was to stupefy 
or intoxicate to the point of insensibility, which was astonishing to the 
Spanish; yet the Indian of the northwest still employs the pipe and 
tobacco in much the same way as did the natives 
who were first encountered by the Spanish invaders. 

In those parts of America where tobacco was not 
used unless as snuff, or where the pipe did not occur, 
the natives were in the habit of chewing maize or some 

other starchy substance 
and making of it an in- 
toxicating drink; and in 
certain portions of South 
America they use cocoa or 
other means to produce in- 
toxication or stupefaction. 
Diaz says: "The city of 
Cholula had an excellent manufacture of earthenware of three colors, 
red, l)lack, and white, painted in different patterns, with which Mexico 
and all the neighboring countries were supplied, as Castile is by those 
of Talavera and Plasceucia."^ If pipes were made of pottery at that 
time specimens should be numerous, but the museum of the city of 
Mexico is said to contain not over half a dozen i)ipes having bowls to 
them; and it may be added regarding these that little can be said 
with certainty concerning their age or those who made them. 

Fig. 42 belongs to a type which, though in some of its features 
resembles the modern pipe, is in others peculiar to Mexico. It is a 
glossy light red pottery from the valley of Mexico, collected by the 
Museo Nacional, Mexico, and contains a tempering of fine sand. It is 
G inches long and 2i inches high, being perfectly flat on the base, which 
is sufificienlly broad to support it in an upright position upon any smooth 
surface, the bowl standing at an angle of about 15 degrees from the 
perpendicular. The interior diameter of the bowl at the top is three- 
fourths of an inch, which enlarges to seven-eighths of an inch at a point 
corresponding to the greatest exterior diameter ; the base of the bowl

contracts inside to half an inch, the stem bole being of one fourth inch 
uniform diameter. The gloss of these pipes is superior to any which 
the writer has seen on pottery of any character from primitive Mexican 
ruins or elsewhere. The surface, while smoothed as though with a 
burnishing tool, gives the writer tbe imi)ression that prior to finishing 
the pipe its surface liad been gone over with a scraping or cutting tool, 
as it is covered with innumerable narrow facets under the glaze, indi- 
cating rather a higher state of art than that evidenced in pre-Cortesian 
Mexican ruins. 

There is in the Douglass collection one of these pipes, the bowl of 
which is white, the stem being pink, the colors gradually blending. It 
was found at Paleuque, and is similar in shape to the pipe here figured, 
even to the glaze. A pipe of pottery in the same collection, which is 
said to have been found at Chatahoochee, Georgia, has a very similar 
form to the Mexican, though the base is not quite so Hat. 
Fig. 4:3 is another clay pipe from the valley of Mexico, collected by 
W. Batchelor, and of the same length and type as that 
shown in the preceding figure. It is of a raw-sienna 
color, having a bluish tinge; the walls of the bowl, 
fig. 42, are, however, thicker, and the stem, also fiat 
on the bottom, broadens toward the end to a width of 

1| inches. The surface of this 
pipe is also glazed, and upon 
its upper side a rude ornamen- 
tation has been incised, subse- 
quent to the firing. The pipe 
looks as though it was in- 
tended to represent a duck's 
head and bill. The eyes con- 
sist each of a central dot, surrounded by two concentric circles, the 
outside one being 1^ inches in diameter, while upon tlie stem, on each 
side, are two parallel lines following the contour of its outline to a point 
where they join, an incision beginning on each side of the stem hole, 
and rnuning parallel to each other for an inch or more, when they 
curve inward and meet. The circles, measured by means of dividers, 
appear to be eqnidistant from the central dot of the eye, though in a 
similar specimen in the Douglass collection the rings appear slightly 
elliptical. 

Professor Holmes refers to a pi])e i^reserved in the Mexic^an National 
Museum, the bowl of which is in the shape of the head' of a creature, 
whether qnadrn])ed or reptile it is impossible to say. The opening in 
the bowl corresponding to the jaws has both below and above a circle 
which appears to represent an eye, which, if they be intended for eyes, 
the head is doubtless that of a snake, a common figure upon American 
pipes. While the writer is inclined to see in the finish of these pipes

foreijiu iuHuences, it must be admitted that liis knowledge of Mexican 
pottery is not sufficient for him to be at all positive. The eiilari;ement 
of the outside of the bowl is peculiar among American pipes to the 
Mexican ware, though almost identically the same shape, but of a 
smaller size, is common among the early English trade pipes. 

A pipe apparently intended to represent the head and ears of some 
(piadruped (tig. 44), made of hard burned pottery, was collected by 
Dr. J. W. Fewkes at the I'ueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico. In 
height and length it is 2i inches by '2 inches. The outside of the bowl 
has a slightly raised rim, in which there are several notches cut through 
the surface, whether for ornament or as a tally it is injpossible to say. 
This specimen in some of its features is similar to pipes found else- 
where, though the writer is inclined to attribute it to no distant period. 
Pipes of the type of tig. 43 are referred to as 
being found at Palenque, one of whu;h has 
been figured in the great work of Kings- 
borougli. 

There is in the Douglass (;ollection a uni(pie 
pendant of serpentine of a green color found 
in a mound on Indian River, Florida, very 
similar in its outline to the Mexican pipe- 
stems which are shaped like a duck's head. 
It has been suggested to the writer that the 
facets upon the Mexican ])ipes with glossy 
surfaces are indicia of the use of the burnish- 
ing tool rather than of scraping or cutting 
implements. While this view may be cor- 
rect the question would be solved were it 
known whether the facets were made before 
or after the ])olishing. 

In discussing references to the use of tobacco among the natives of 
Mexico and the West Indies it will probably be best to include those 
countries which first fell under early Spanish influences, comprising 
the coast of California, and, in a measure, that of Florida, before inves- 
tigating conditions to the northward. 

Friar Marco de Nica, in his journey to Cibola the year preceding the 
expedition of Vasquez de Coronado (1539), does not refer to the natives 
being addicted to smoking or using the pipe, though they were famil- 
iar, probably, both with the cigarette and the tubular pipe. This, how- 
ever, it must be remembered, was considered not only by the Spanish 
but later by certain of the Freuch as an idolatrous practice. 

Alarcon in 1540 speaks of the imtives having "physicians who cure 
them with charms and blowings which they make."' This there is 
little doubt was a reference to the tubular fire cure elsewhere more 
minutely described.

410 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

As late as 1766 tbe uatives of California were said to be "entirely 
ignorant of the effects of strong drink, and even if tliey do become 
drnnk during the feast it is only done Avith the smoke of wild tobacco," 
which the author calls "Cimmaron,"' which plant, under the name of 
"Cimeron" {Nicotimia attennota), De Paw asserts was used not only 
by the Californians, but by all the Western Indians,' 

Venegas observes that they "use no intoxicating liquors among 
them, and it is only on their festivals that they intoxicate themselves 
with the smoke of wild tobacco '" 

The Californians are also said never to have thought of making use 
of potters' clay for making cups, pots, bowls, etc., by hardening in the 
sun or by fire until taught by the whites.* 

In this respect they would appear to differ from the natives of the 
greater part of the continent, but that it is a fact appears to be demon- 
strated by the excavations of Yarrow and Schumacher made in 1874; 
though it should be remembered that the Californians possessed a good 
sujjply of steatite from which they made "ollas" (bowls) and dishes. 
The veins of steatite or soapstone appear to have been worked in many 
parts of the continent, where suitable material was available for mak- 
ing bowls and dishes from a very ancient period; and in those sections 
of the country abounding in soapstone pottery is less abundant, 
though its scarcity, especially in the Atlantic States, extends but few 
miles from the quarries. 

The Californians are also said to have burned the abalone shell for 
the lime to mix with tobacco to make them drunk.' 

The writer is informed by Maj. J. W. Powell that the Piemas, Mari- 
copas, Mqjave, and Southern Utes smoke. the leaves of the manzanita 
(Arctostaphylos glauca) and the Jamestown weed {Datura stramonium), 
the latter for the purpose of inducing a form of intoxication ; at times 
they also chewed it for the same purpose. The Assiniboines smoke 
the leaves of the bear berry {Arctostaphylos m^a-'ursi) mixed with tobacco. 
In Alaska " the economical Indian usually cuts up a little birch wood 
or the inner bark of the poplar and mixes it with his tobacco.'"^ 

Alvar Nunez Cabeca de Vaca, who was, as he informs us, treasurer] 
and alguazil major of the expedition of Pamphilo Narvaez in 1527, | 
whose expedition was to conquer and govern the provinces toward thej 
river of palms, was, with Castillo, Dorantes, and a negro, Estavanico, i 
the only survivors who returned to civilization. These four men were 
for years prisoners among the natives, but finally escaped, and after

years of wandering' through the wilderness rejoined the Spanish in 
New Mexico, wliere the relation of their reallj^ wonderful adventures 
caused great astonishmeut. Cabeca de Yaca, among the Indians 
"became a pedlar," and was sent by his savage masters from "place to 
place looking for what thej' wanted."' " My priucii»al articles of com- 
merce were," he says, " sea shells, with which they cut a kind of fruit 
like a bean which they use as a medicine, and little sea shells which are 
used as money. I brought ba(;k in exchange skins, and a kind of red 
earth used in coloring the skin and hair; stones fen- arrow points, very 
hard reeds for making them, glue, and scarlet-colored hoops made of 
hair.'' ' What he says of smoking is quite unsatisfactory, as his only ref- 
erence appears to be that "in this country they stupefy themselves with 
a smoke which they buy at any ])rice."'- 

Ferdinand de Soto, in 1539, entered Florida on the west coast, and, 
crossing the Alabama, Tombigbee, and Black Warrior rivers, reached 
the Mississi[)pi north of the Arkansas," though he does not appear to 
refer to the smoking habit. The inference drawn is negative, it is true, 
but had the natives smoked to the extent which they did a hundred 
years later all over the contiment it can hardly be supposed that there 
would not have been reference to it. 

Discoveries are constantly being made in Indian burial places of 
articles of European manufacture lying beside objects of the pure stone 
age, consequently there is great uncertainty in establishing the date of 
a burial. Many of the Florida mounds evidence apparent great age, 
and on the other hand many appear to be quite modern and to have 
been erected since the end of the lirst half of the seventeenth century. 
Professor Putnam instances the case of a burial mound in a group of 
mounds in Orange Countj", Florida, where "a number of ornaments 
made of silver, copper, and brass were found, also glass beads and 
iron implements which Avere associated with i)ottery and stone imple- 
ments of native make."^ 

The Floridians in 1564 were said by Sir John Hawkins to have used 
in traveling a dried herb, which, with a cane and an earthen cup in the 
end, they '• with Are and the dry herbs put together do suck through the 
cane the smoke thereof, which smoke satisfieth their hunger and there- 
with they live four or five days without meat or drink, and these all the 
Frenchmen used for this lairpose."-^ 

This reference precedes by twenty years the voyage of Ealph Lane, 
who is said first to have carried tobacco to England, and is the earliest 
reference which the writer has found in which the bowl is spoken of as 
distinct from the pipestem. Jean Ribault, in 1505, says "the natives

consider nothing- more valuable than birds' feathers of <lifferent colors." ' 
Yet neither he nor Laudoniere in 1564, in his second voyage, nor l>e 
Gonrgues in i5<)7-(>8 appear to have referred to the pipe and tobacco 
being used in Florida. These travels have all been described with con- 
siderable minuteness, and had smoking been at that date a general 
habit there would surely have been reference to it. Professor Jeffries 
Wyman found no i)ipes in the shell heaps of the St. Johns River, 
Florida, and thinks "that had they been used by the builders of these 
heaps it is hardly possible, in the many excavations that have been 
made and the laruc facilities offered by the undermining action of the 
river, that some evidence of them should not have been detected."^ 

Mr. Frank Gushing, in the recent Florida excavations, where he made 
a remarkably rich find of aboriginal remains in stone, shell, wood, and 
pottery, sjjcaks of its being noticeable that there was an absence of 
pipes. ' On the other hand, Mr. Clarence B, Moore, who has made exten- 
sive investigations of the shell heaps of Florida, records that " at a depth 
of G feet from the surface of Mulberry Mound was discovered a pipe of 
earthenware complete in every part." He regards this as positive evi- 
dence that the people who built the shell heaps were familiar with the 
smoking habit.^ Mr. Moore considered this mound among the later of 
the shell heaps. 

A summary of evidence, therefore, appears to indicate that i)rior to 
the date of Alvarez and De Soto the smoking habit, if indulged in, 
was employed as a religious rite and not as a pastime, but subsequent 
to the Si)anish settlements along the coast smoking became general. 
De Vaca refers to the shell heaps of the Gulf of Mexico, and says that 
the natives "subsist for three months on these shellfish and drink very 
bad water." ^ 

Among the vast deposits of shells on the Chesapeake Bay shores in 
Maryland and Virginia, where thousands and tens of thousands of acres 
in the aggregate are covered with shell village sites, the pipe is almost 
the rarest object found. The shells of these heaps vary in depth up to 
5 feet, yet the writer only knows of two primitive pipes ever being 
found, while the English trade pi])e is not uncommon. These sliell 
heaps wouhl be occupied during the warmer months when conditions 
were such as to conceal a pipe dropped in the grass or uiulerbrush, and 
one would sui)pose that they would be found as other objects are. The 
burial customs, however, of these Indians are little understood, audit 
is yet i)ossible that an investigation of their graves when found may 
clear up our understanding of the subject. The writer inclines, there-

fore, to tlie belief that while smoking was probably indulged in, it was 
but to a limited extent until the whites, by the^cultivation of tobiicco, 
popularized its use. 

That the natives of the shores of the great bays of the Atlantic coast 
were reasonably fair boatmen one would expect, but Bartram's asser- 
tion is almost incredible tluit they "have large handsome canoes, some 
of them commoilious enough to hold twenty or thirty warriors. In 
these large canoes they descend the river on trading and hunting expe- 
ditions to the seacoast, neighboring islands, and keys, quite to the 
point of Florida, and sometimes across the Gulf, extending their navi- 
gations to the Bahanui Islands and even to Cuba. A crew of these 
adventurers had just arrived, having returned from Cuba a few days 
before our arrival, with a cargo of liquors, coffee, sugar, and tobacco."^ 

The natives were great hunters and thoroughly acquainted with the 
natural food supply, in search of which they wandered great distances 
as it became seasonable in different jdaces. As we are informed by 
Cabeca de A'aca, they have been known to travel hundreds of miles in 
a direct line from home for the i)urpose of hunting or of attacking some 
enemy. In their wanderings in search of food, upon their hunting 
expeditions, and np(m the no less important search lor suitable mate- 
rial for the manufacture of their implements tliey became thoroughly 
familiar with the minerals of the country, and with the artificial frac- 
ture of those minerals, which was often of greater importance to them 
than was the mineral itself, for to the Indian stone was valuable or the 
reverse according to the ease with which it could be chi[)ped, pecked, 
cut, or ground. Pickett says: "Upon the creeks and rivers in Ala- 
bama, where they meander through the mountainous regions, are occa- 
sionally seen cuttings upon rocks, which have also been im])roperIy 
attributed to European discoverers. In the country of Tallapoosa, not 
far below the mouth of the Sougohatchee and a few miles east of the 
Tallapoosa Kiver, are cliffs of a singular kind of a gray rock, rather soft 
and having the ai)pearance of containing silver ore. The face of these 
cliff's is very much disfigured by having round pieces taken out of them. 
The ancient Indians used to resort to this place to obtain materials for 
manufacturing pi])es of large and small sizes and other household 
vessels. They cut out the pieces with flint rocks fixed in wooden 
handles. After working around as deep as they desired the ])iece was 
prized out of the rock. The author is also sustained in this ])osition by 
unquestionable Indian testimony wliich has been procured by liim."- 
He refers without doubt to a steatite or soapstone outcrop, a stone 
which has always been a favorite mineral from which to make pipes 
and bowls for cooking. In addition to its ability to resist heat, it was 
the most easily cut of all the minerals. What is said of Alabama would

Mississippi, from tbe earliest period, 1. p. 177, Charleston, 1851. 



414 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

apply ecpially to every State certainly as far north as Connecticut. 
The steatite has been ev^ery where woiked by natives to furnish culinary 
vessels, and we see that in this, as in all other stones, the native 
thoroughly appreciated the varying texture of minerals and selected 
only those best suited to his requirements. The advent of the white 
man caused an immediate revolution in aboriginal art. AVherever Ids 
wares were distributed, skins were traded for -blankets, and, as School- 
craft well says, "Europeans gave them iron and brass for the rude clay 
pots; steel for wooden traps; gunpowder, the ritie, and guns for bows 
and arrows; fire steels and flints for the painful ])rocess of percussion; 
the White Chapel for the bone needle; the steel awl for the aishkim or 
tip of the deer's horn, and, in fine, a style of arts so superior to all the 
aboriginal modes of meeting the common wants of life that the latter 
fell into disuse as soon as the Eurojtean fiibrics could be obtained."' 

Think of the immeasurable superiority of a tool of irou or steel over 
the best and sharpest of those of stone. The one implement cut wood 
or soapstoue where the other may be said only to have bruised it. The 
metal point, as a perforater or drill, and the rasp must have been very 
attractive tools to people who had theretofore known only the stone or 
wood drill-point used with sand, or the grinding stone. If we examine 
any collection of ancient American pipes the extreme care with which 
they have been finished is noticeable, though it is seldom that a polish 
of any kind is met with in any implements of aboriginal art north of 
Mexico. Compare, however, a general collection of stone implements 
and the difference of surface wear is noticeable, and we see that not 
only have rubbing stones varied according to the work required of 
them, but a strong suspicion is aroused that the sands and smoothing 
material were more highly appreciated than would be suspected by a 
casual observer. If one will use sand to smooth a stone surface he 
will quickly ai)preciate that sands vary enormously in their cutting 
properties. IMiny shows that this was appreciated in his day, for he 
discusses the relative merits of " the sand of Ethiopia" and "of India," 
while for polishing marble he discusses the properties of "Indian sand 
calcined," "the sand of Naxos," and that of Coptos, generally known 
as " Egyptian sand;" " and more recently," he says, " a stone has been 
discovered in a creek of the Adriatic Sea that is equally efticacious for 
this i)uri)ose. Thebaic stone is considered well adapted, as also porous 
stone, or pumice i)owdered fine."^

AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 415 



With leaves from a bowl or basket of tlie period of Laudoiiiere's visit to 
that part of tlie territory tlieii called Florida, which covered an indef- 
inite geographical area. The anthor of Kecherches Philosophiques 
des Aniericaiiis refers to the custom of the Northern American Indians 
making the women and slaves that are to be sacrificed on the death of 
a chief take drugs. They use, he says, the leaves of tobacco broken 
and made into paste, of which they form large balls, that those who are 
to die are required to swallow. They make them drink a glass of 
water, which in dissolving throws them into a comjdete delerium.' 

Bartram, setting out from Mobile in 1777 and arriving at Talusa, 
speaks of the houses of the people being " decorated with various paint- 
ings and sculptures, which I suppose to be hieroglyphic, and as an 
historical and legendary of political and sacerdotal affairs; but they are 
Extremely picturesijue, or caricature; as men in a variety of attitudes, 
some ludicrous enougli, others having 
some kind of animal, as those of a duck, 
turkey, bear, fox, wolf, etc., and again, 
those kind of creatures as having the 
human head. These designs are not ill 
executed, the outlines bold, free, and well 
l^roportioned."- 

It must be remembered that Bartram 
is speaking of a time two hundred and 
thirty years subsequent to the period 
when these Indians first had oi)portunity 
to become tolerably familiar with iron 
tools, though there yet remained even at 
that date much of primitive culture. The 
savage, made familiar with shar[) cutting 
tools, quickly takes to carving as soon as some one suggests the idea of 
design. With these natives iron was quite a common i)ossession at the 
period of Bartram's visit, and the churches of the French and Spanish 
had both familiarized the natives with the principles of carving. The 
French and Spanish of the period Avere well skilled carvers and car- 
penters, whom the Indians would not be slow to imitate. Though it is 
not intended to question the fact tiiat rude carving may have been 
executed by some of the Atlantic coast Indians at an early period, it 
is suggested that there is little evidence that any of them carved in a 
manner to justify more being snid of their work than that it was "not 
ill executed,'' the known antiquities of the jMexicans being superior 
examples of their date. 

Yerazzano, in his voyage along the coast of America in 1524, from 
the thirty fourth degree of latitude to Newfoundland, probably refers 
to the use of the tobacco pipe in some form in his allusion to the natives 
who '4ive long and are seldom sick; and if they chance to fall sick at

any time they heal themselves with fire, without any pliysician. They 
say that they die for very age."' lie nowhere speaks of tobacco or the 
pipe, unless it be in the above sentencte, tliougli stnpping- in many ])la(es. 

Powell's map of the areas occupied by the ditt'erent liuguistic stocks 
of Indians at the time of the first advent of the wliites shows that 
members of a given stock were often separated from each other by 
natives speaking dissimilar languages. The Sioux are found in North 
and South Carolina, the Algon(iuin ah)ug the Atlantic coast, while 
a tribe of the Iroquoian stock were located in Tennessee, each cut oft' 
by long distances from the main body speaking the language of their 
particular stock; and many other instances are noted on the same map. 
To carry history back only a few decades would doubtless materially 
change the geographical distribution of the tribes, due largely to the 
success or failure of their interminable internecine wars in which they 
were commonly engaged. 

From the earliest period of white occupancy of Maryland and Vir- 
ginia, tobacco constituted the great bulk of the exports of those 
colonies. The wonderful spread of its consumption during the first 
half of the seventeenth century created an enormous demand for the 
])roduct, and the consequent inflation of its price was an inducement 
to the colonists to devote their greatest energies to its cultivation, to 
the exclusion of necessary vegetables and cereals, whereby on more 
than one occasion the po])ulation suffered from a scarcity of food. 
This plant consists of several species of Xicotiana (of the natural order 
of Solanacew), but those of which the leaves are used as a narcotic are 
few in comparison to the whole number. 

The pipe of the Indians of New Sweden, otherwise Pennsylvania, 
described by Holm, appears to have had a stem equal in length to any 
on the coutinent. He says they " make tobacco pipes out of reeds 
about a man's length; the bowl is made of horn and to contain a great 
quantify of tobacco; they generally present these pipes to their good 
friends when they come to visit them at their houses and wish them to 
stay some time longer; then the friend can not go away without having 
a smoke out of the pipe. They make them of red, yellow, and blue 
clay, of which there is great quantity in the country; also of white, 
gray, green, brown, and black and blue stone, which are so soft that

was ill America about the same time. Tlie length of this pipe and stem 
ai)i)eais jiioat in comparison with pipes with which we are familiar, 
though (leorge Catlin rei)resents a Chippewa Indian standing erect, 
leaning on a i)ipestem. It should be remembered, however, that some 
of Ilolm's assertions have been questioned, aud are to be taken with 
grains of allowance, notably that reference to '^a large and horrible 
serpent which is called a rattlesnake. It has a head like that of a dog 
and can bite off a man's leg" as clear as it had been hewn down with 
an ax.'" Though such snake stories are of course the exaggerations of 
ignorant people, it is the wonderful and mysterious which has greatest 
attraction for the multitude, and consequently such material will stray 
into print when histories are written by persons not themselves ac- 
quainted intimately with the country of which they write. The suake 
was a totem of many Indian tribes, if not of most of them, aud is often 
represented coiled around the pipe bowls in graceful curves or lying 
along the stems, usually facing the smoker. Certain of the Pueblo 
Indians, the writer is informed, never kill suakes, even the deadly rat- 
tlers, because of their sacred character. When one is found in too 
close proximity to a camp, it is caught between the forks of a stick and 
carried to some secluded spot, where it is released. A similar veneration 
is said by the elder Pliny to have prevailed. ''In Syria also," he says, 
"and especially along the banks of the Euphrates, the serpents never 
attack the Syrians when they are asleep; on this account they never 
kill them."- 

Kalm, who was in iv^ew Sweden in 1749 at a place called Raccoon, on 
the Delaware Eiver below Philadelphia, says "the natives had tobacco 
pipes of clay, manufactured by themselves, at the time the Swedes 
arrived here. * * * They did not always smoke true tobacco, but 
made use of another plant instead of it, which was unknown t.) the old 
Swedes, one of whom assured me it was not the common mullein, Avhich 
IS generally called Indian tobacco."^ 

Roger Williams says of the ISTarragan setts : "They generally all take 
tobacco; and it is commonly the only plant which men labor in, the 
women managing all the rest; they say they take tobacco for two 
causes; first, against the rheume, which causeth toothache, which they 
are impatient of; secondly, to revive and refresh them, they drinking 
nothing but water." ^ 

This tobacco he calls " Wuttammanog;" "that is a weak tobacco, 
which the men j^lant themselves very frequently; yet I never see any 
take so excessively as I have seen men in Europe; yet excess were more

tolerable in them, because they want the refreshing of beer with which 
God hath vouchsafed Europe.' The men throughout the country have 
a tobacco bag, with a pipe in it, hanging at their back. Sometimes they 
make such great pipes, both of wood and stone, that are 2 foot long, 
with men or beasts carved so big or massive that a man may be hurt mor 
tally by one of them ; but these (iommonly come from the Mauquauwogs 
(Mohawks), or the man-eaters, 300 or 400 miles from us. Tliey have an 
excellent art to cast our pewter and brass into very neat and artificial 
pipes." ^ "Narragansett," says Wood, ''was the storehouse of all such 
kinds of merchandise as is amongst the Indians of those parts. From 
hence othei- tribes have their great stone pipes, which will hold a 
quarter of an ounce of tobacco, which they make with steel drills and 
other instruments. Such is their ingenuity and dexterity that they 
can imitate the mold so accurately that were it not for matter and 
eolor it were hard to distinguish them. They make them of green and 
sometimes of black stone." ^ 

In 1074 the Narragansetts are spoken of as having been a great peo- 
ple, whose sachem was about Cannonicut Island, and who "are now 
but few comparatively; all that people can not make above 1,000 men."^ 
This tribe was probably one of those which sutl'ered so severely during 
the first half of the seventeenth century from the ravages of an epidemic 
that is said to have carried off the inhabitants of whole villages. 
Williams gives the name of a pipe as " Wuttammagon — literally, a drink 
instrument," or "Hupuonck." In 1620 we are told that ''Massassoyt," 
chief of the Wampanoags, was "a lusty man of middle age, of a grave, 
demure countenance and sparing of speech. He had a long knife hang- 
ing in a string at his bosom, and behind at his back a little pouch of 
tobacco. This was furniture he never was without. His men also had 
their bags of tobacco at their backs." '^ 

Samuel G. Drake says of Massassoit that he "differed from the rest 
of his followers only in a great chain of white bone beads. About his 
neck hangs a little bag of tobacco, which he drank and gave us to 
drink." •' 

James Thatcher refers also in 1621 to Samoset having a wild cat skin 
on one arm, coming with some of his companions to the town of Plym- 
outh, and bringing with them some parched corn reduced to a fine 
powder called "nokehike," or "nocake," which they eat mixed with water, 
and "had a little tobacco in a bag, of which they drank frequently.""

AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 419 

"The Literary Gazette, September 11, 1819, page 588, says the Turks 
use the phrase 'driiikinj;- tobacco.' 

"In Webster's Dictionary one detiuitiou of 'to drink,' is 'to inhale, to 
smoke, as tobacco.' 

"In Miseries of Enforced jMarriage, V, page 0, by George Wilkins, 
1607, appears the line 'Feed well, drink tobacco.' 

"In the Roaring (iirl, Middletou & Decker, 1611, one of the i^ersou- 
ages says of some tobacco, ' This will serve to drink in my chamber.' 

"A reference in one of Donne's satires, I, page 87 (Donne flourished 
1610-1020), IS as follows: 

Till one which did excel 

Th' Indians in diinkinj;- his toltaceo well. 

"That actual swallowing of the smoke was the mode in England at 
the time mentioned is shown by several contemporary illustrations of 
customs where the pipe is in the mouth or hand and the smoke is issu- 
ing from the nostrils.'' ' 

The excesses to which Williams refers as existing in Europe in the 
use of tobacco must have prevailed to an inordinate degree in the 
plantations, for a statute was enacted in 1633 m that of Massachusetts 
which provided that there must be no idleness "under penalty," and 
especial reference was made to "common coasters, unpfttable fowlers, 
and tobacco takers.'" 

In the account of Frobisher's second voyage, about 1577, to the coast 
in the vicinity of Hudson Bay, there does not appear to be reference to 
l)ipes and tobacco, although the implements and clothes of the natives 
are referred to with some particularity. * 

If at that period the natives of Hudson Bay had no tobacco, which, 
however, is at present uncertain, the first English traders would have 
lost no opportunity to popularize its use in their journeys to the far 
north, where they went in search ot food-tishes, as they did into the 
interior In search of peltries. The earliest reference which the writer 
has found to smoking among the Hudson Bay people is that of Henry 
Ellis, who went in search of the ISorthwest passage in 1746-47, by 
which time the habit had become general. He says : "These people have 
a very extraordinary custom. It is that when the lathers and mothers 
can no longer support themselves with their own labor they require 
their children to strangle them; and according to them it is an act of 
obedience on the part of the children, who ])erform the act as follows: 
First they make a pit, which the old person enters; for some time they 
converse with their children, at times they smoke a pipe, take a drink, etc.

They then say they are ready; then two of the chihlren put a leather 
strap around the parent's neck, and standing opposite each other they 
pull Avith all tlicir strength until the parent is dead. Tliose who have 
no children often beg their friends to do it for them, but often they do 
not accomplish their wish in this respect."' 

Cartier, in his lirst voyage to the St. Lawrence in 1534, when he went 
as far as Saguenay, does not mention smoking, though he does the fol 
lowing year, when he reached Hochelega. With the exceptions noted 
the people of North America generally appear to have been familiar 
with the practice of smoking prior to the ariival of French, English, 
Dutch, or Swedes. How far their intercourse had extended with the 
Spanish there is a lack of testimony, though that there was an early 
knowledge of Spanish and English existence is possible, for the first 
travelers on the Mississippi heard from the natives of men who rode 
horses in the southwest, and of people who traded them gnus along 
the eastern coast. The Indian wandered over immense distances, and 
Carver records, about 17G8, that "the Winnebagos, from their invet- 
erate hatred of the Spanish, informed me that they made many excur- 
sions to the southwest which took up several moons. An elderly chief 
told me that about forty-six winters ago (1722) he marched at the 
head of fifty warriors to the southwest for three moons and attacked 
the Si)auish."^ 

The Gros Ventres of Minnesota "used to raise small quantities of 
tobacco, the leaf of which as obtained from them was considered of 
great value, and for which their fellow Indians paid large prices. Peace 
parties of the Knistenos and Ojibways often proceeded hundreds of 
miles chietly for procuring their much coveted tobacco leaf."^ 

The Senecas "used to smoke tobacco and the bark of the Wahoo" 
(euonomous), "called by them cannakanick. They often mixed it with 
tobacco; they also smoked the bark of a species of dogwood. We used 
to call it in Pennsylvania the arrowwood, from the shape of the 
sprouts."^ 

The word "kiP likinick" is extensively employed among the Western 
tribes to designate tobacco. It is from the Dakota tongue, meaning 
literally redwood, the substance generally employed by the Menomoni 
being the red osier {Cornns stolonifera Michaux.) 

"Tobacco is frequently used by the Menomoni as an ofi'eriug. It is 
placed upon grave boxes; sprinkled on stones or rocks of abnormal 
shapes, their form being attributed to the great deity."''

next to tobace-o was considered "one of their most fashionable treats 
when mixed iu about equal proportions.'" 

Hunter, who was thoroughly acquainted with the Indians, having 
been a i^risoner among them for many years, shows, however, that the 
treatment of disease by fire was not always in conjunction with tobacco. 
"They sometimes," he says, "relieve inward pain by setting a jiiece of 
touchwood on fire and permitting it to produce a blister over the pained 
part, saying that such treatment draws the enemy from his lurking 
place and exposes him to direct attack."' 

In 1823 the Omaha were said to "frequently eject the smoke through 
the nostrils and often inhale it into the lungs, from which it is gradu- 
alh' ejected again as they converse, or in expiration.'" ' 

Long says "the kinnicanick, or, as the Omaliaw call it, ninnegahe, 
which they use for smoking in their i)ipes is composed partly of tobacco 
and partly of the leaves of the sumac {Rhus glabra), but many prefer 
to the latter ingredient the inner bark of the red willow [Cornus 
cericea), and when neither of the two latter can be obtained the bark 
of the arrowwood ( Viburnum) is substituted for them. These two 
ingredients are well dried over a fire and comminuted together by fric- 
tion between the hands." ^ 

The writer is informed that the kinnikinik of the Indians of the 
southwestern portion of the United States, notably of the Cheyennes, 
Comanches. Arapahoes, Kiowas, and Sioux, consists of the inner bark 
of the sweet willow [Salix nigra), which being first dried and pulver- 
ized by rubbing between the hands is used with sumac {Bhus trilobaia) 
leaves; at other times they use the sumac alone. The Rev. M. Eells 
refers to killikinick as the dried leaves of a small bush which grows a 
foot or two high, and of dried laurel {Kalmia latifolia); also the dried 
bark of iron wood {Carpinus caroliniana) is used when they are short 
of tobacco to mix with it, but it is seldom if ever used alone. Tobacco 
is obtained from the Americans.' In 1843, near Walla Walla, the 
Nez Perces called tobacco "smoke," and remarked "we are better 
than the white men, for they eat smoke: we do not eat smoke. Such 
is their attachment for this stupefying vegetable that to obtain it 
they will part with their last article of food or clothing, or even take 
down the poles which uphold their dwellings." '^ Marcy and McClellan

say also that the Comauclies were extravagantly fond of tobacco in 
1852.' 

The Rev. Pere Morice says of the "Tsilkohtines ties Rochers," the 
Denes of the western Rocky Mountains in British Columbia, that their 
"pipe is of serpentine or other stone and is common to both sexes, for 
it must be remembered that among the savages the women are invet- 
erate smokers."' 

The Abanaqui of Maine, who are of Algonquin stock, still smoke 
the outer bark of the red osier {Salix purpurea), the bark of the 
j)ine tree, and both leaf and bark of the squaw bush ( Vacciniu^n strom- 
eiiium), and mix the musk of the muskrat with the tobacco to give it a 
flavor. 

Du Pratz refers to " a bank in which there were veins of white 
earth. The clay was unctuous and fine, from which I have seen very 
liretty pottery made. In the same banks ocher is found, which the 
Natchez come to get to smear their pottery with. This pottery was 
very pretty. When so smeared with ocher it became red after being 
cooked."^ 

Some of the purest clay pipes found are from the Lower Mississippi. 
In the far North, Alexander Mackenzie, in 1789, made the Slave or Dog 
Rib Indians smoke, "though it was evident they did not know the use 
of tobacco."^ 

The natives of the lower part of the Mackenzie River saw the first 
whites in 1788. These were probably from tlie ships commanded by 
Captain Cook."^ 

Franklin calls attention to the fact that as late as 1827 the natives 
of Herschell Island, at the mouth of the Mackenzie, "used tobacco, 
and some of our visitors had smoked it, but thought the flavor very 
disagreeable."" He thought they had obtained it of the Russian 
traders. 

The shape of the Eskimo pipe, as well as the diminutive size of its 
bowl, forcibly suggests that it is an iniportation into America from the 
continent of Asia, brought there likely by the Japanese whom the 
Russians appear to have brought to the continent. 

Near Icy Cape, in latitude 70° 43", longitude 159° 46' west, in 1826, 
Beechy says he found tobacco the most merchantable article, though

some tobacco that was offered for a lance, was resolute in not deliver- 
ing up either."' 

In latitude 48° as early as 1578, at a point approximately where the 
Aht and Chinook Indians are now located, on the Pacific Coast, the 
natives gave to Sir Francis Drake a little basket made of rushes and 
filled with an herb which they called " 7'«/>r*//."- 

At another jmint Drake refers to "tobali" being offered his people 
"for sacrifice upon their persuasion that we were gods." ' 

About latitude 38° to 40° on the Pacific Coast, as early as 1000, 
"divers pieces of earthenware pots, as finely made as those in Spain," 
are referred to by Francis Ulloa.^ 

The writer has endeavored to cite as far as possible all early refer- 
ences to snuiking material and pipes from Spanish, French, English, 
Dutch, and Swedish sources, which relate to the Atlantic or Pacific 
coast as well as to the interior of the continent. While some writers 
are silent on the subject, those who do refer to the custom do so invari- 
ably in a manner to make it conclusive that the pipe and tobacco, or 
the plant smoked, was regarded as important in all serious functions 
as well as in many cases requiring medical treatment. To make the 
fire with which the pipe was lighted throughout the whole continent, 
the straight shaft revolved between the extended palms appears to 
have been commonly employed in the same manner as the natives of 
Australia are known to have used it from an early i)eriod. The Papa- 
gos of Xew Mexico as early as 1848 made fire by plowing, as the writer 
is informed by Gen. D. H. Itucker, who was well acquainted with these 
Indians. This process is performed by rubbing the point of one stick 
rapidly back and forth in the groove of another piece of wood. 

Clavigero tells us the Mexicans made fire, as did the ancient shep- 
herds of Europe, " by the friction of two pieces of wood." ^ As early as 
1580 John Davis describes the making of fire in the extreme north of 
the continent by means of the strap drill,- though the knowledge of this 
drill had been obtained almost certainly from Europeans, the American 
Indian havnig before their acquaintance with the whites had no knowl- 
edge of the principle of such an implement. 

The Virginia Indians in 1002 were said by Captain Gosnoll to make 
fire '' with a flat piece of emery stone and sort of mineral which they 
can not tell us the name of, but they have a piece of dry touchwood 
ready which receives the spark they knock out between the other two."^

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897 



The subject of primitive fire making has been exhaustively treated 
by Dr. Walter Hough, of Washington City.' 

The size and shape of some pipes are more indicative of their owners' 
occupation than (me at first glance would be inclined to suppose. 
Nomads or hunters, for example, without fixed dwelling places, would 
not employ the ponderous pipes often found along the shores of the 
Mississippi River and in the Southern States, weighing at times many 
pounds, and often carved in the form of some bird or animal. Unless 
carried by canoe they would constitute a serious problem in the move- 
ments of a family. There may also be a serious doubt whether the 
delicately made pottery i^ipes of the Southern States and the equally 
carefully shaped specimens from northern New York, showing at times 
a thin bird's bill 2 or 3 inches above the bowl, were not necessarily the 
property of people living in permanent habitations. 

PIPE BOWLS WITHOUT STEMS. 

There are many ways of accounting for the evolution of the tubular 
pipe into one of a rectangular shape. The smoking of the tube would 
undoubtedly be extremely awkward, and notwithstanding the pebble 
or pellet of pottery dropped into the bowl, the material smoked would 
escape into the smokers mouth while being held perpendicularly as 

though drinking, while an accidental or 
intentional curve would suggest a valuable 
improvement in shape. 

Mr. Clarence B. Moore found on the 
St. Johns River, Florida, a tubular pipe 
slightly curved and made of pottery with 
the elliptical cross section, which shai)e 
may well have been caused in drying the 
clay before burning. There is a tubular 
pipe of steatite in the collection of the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania curved slightly in 
its longitudinal section, as is the California 
specimen herein illustrated. 

Having considered the tubular pipe, 
which consisted of a stem and bowl in the 
same plane, we shall next discuss those 
pipes consisting of a bowl alone, its walls being perforated for the 
insertion of a separate stem. Whether this pipe should come next in 
order is open to question. In this type ordinarily the stem hole is 
approximately one-third the greatest diameter of the bowl, though 
there are as a matter of course rare exceptions to the rule where 
these diameters differ. 

Fig. 40 is of this type, yet it would readily pass for one of recent pro- 
duction. It was found in Oregon, collected by Mr. T. Carver ; it is drilled 
from a cube of volcanic tuff, which to a casual observer might well pass

for ail ordinary piece of building brick. In length it is 1.] inches, in 
iieight 1| inches, and 1^ inches wide. In this specimen, as is usual in 
pipes of this type, it is observed that both bowl and stem have been 
bored by means of a drill with a solid and not a tubular point, though 
it is often found that the bowl has been subse- 
quently enlarged by scraping or gouging. These 
l)ipes were smoked with stems of wood, reed, or 
bone, governed by the supply of the locality. 

Of identical type is a pipe from Berks County, 
Pennsylvania, collected by Hon. George M. Keim, 
which is of a light brown talc. The block from 
which it (fig. -il) is made is rectangular at the base, 
about 2h inches in height, becoming cylindrical at 
the to]) of the bowl. This pipe is evidently in an 
untinished condition, and therefore doubly inter- 
esting, as showing much of the process of work 
upon it. The whole surface is covered with nar- 
row facets, showing the mark of the blade with 
which it was cut; the uniformity in their width 
and their unusual length demonstrates conclu- 
sively that the tool was of metal. 

Above the steal hole a ridge has been left almost 
entirely encircling the bowl, sufficiently pronounced to show that it 
was intended as an ornament. At one point on this specimen are 
noticeable a number of equidistant straight lines, which appear to have 
been made with a metal file, and which are com- 
mon on so many American pipes. 

A gray sandstone ovoid bowl (fig. 48) from 
Brownsville, Ohio, collected by Mr. VV. Anderson, 
is slightly broken around the top; the rest of the 
exterior surface, however, is perfectly smooth 
and without ornamentation. This bowl has been 
ground into shape, the cavities being made by 
means of solid drill points. It is of symmetrical 
ovoid form, the base being flattened, and thethick- 
ness of the walls is scarcely one-eighth of an inch. 
The bowl of fig. 49 is ground similar to that of 
the preceding specimen and is about the same 
height, If inches. It is made from an indurated 
clay of a grayish color. The stem hole has been 
bored by means of a large drill, and is half an inch 
in diameter at the surface, decreasing to three- 
eighths of an inch where the liole enters the bowl, which makes it evi- 
dent that a stem could not be used with such a pipe unless it were 
bound to the bowl with a lashing of some kind, probably of hide. The 
wall of this bowl at its upper rim is ground until it is scarcely thicker 
than the cutting edge of a knife blade, the specimen being similar in

type vary both in size and exterior form, probably as much as do those 
of any type found on the continent. Some appear 
to have been made from natural Water-washed peb- 
bles from the streams, and are without any evidence 
of artificial finish other than that of bowl and stem 
holes at right angles to each other; others are elab- 
orate imitations of nearly the shape of Greek vases, 
having at times elaborate figures carved upon their 
surfaces. The stem holes are usually simple per- 
forations made to intersect the wall of the bowl at 
its base, though at times upon the surface of the 
bowl the stem hole is in a slight shoulder project- 
iug from the bowl as though for ornament, but it 
may well be intended to furnish a better socket for 
a stem, these being probably tnuch more recent pro- 
ductions than those of simpler form. 

Fig. 50, from Bloomfield, New York, collected by 
Gol. E. Jewett, is made from serpentine, and is 2i 
inches long; in outline it is similar to the elongated tubular pipes so 
widely distributed throughout the United States. In this instance, 
however, the stem is at right angles to the bowl, the exterior surface 
is smoothed almost to a polish, though the interior 
shows the process of enlargement by gouging, so com- 
monly noticed in tubular pipes. At the base of this 
bowl there is a diagonally bored hole, which perfo- 
rated the specimen, coming out at the end of tlie cone. 
This hole is intended evidently for the attachment of 
a string, as is the case with so many of the pipes found 
in countries where deep snows lie. The edges of the 
bowl and also of the base of this conoidal specimen 
are notched, the bowl with twenty, and the base with 
eight incisions. A knife blade, however, tits exactly 
from one notch across to another, both at top and bot- 
tom, which would indicate that they were intended 
rather as ornamentation than as scores, such as were 
at times kept upon the handles of tomahawks and 
l)ipe stems. There are upon the surface of this pipe 
some finely scratched lines, which, owing to erosion 
or weathering, are so nearly obliterated as to prevent 
tracing them with exactness, though they appear orig- 
inally to have been pictographic. There is a pij^e of 
this type in the Smithsonian collection upon which 
the only visible work of human hands consists of a 
small hole bored through the shell of a hollow concretion. It has, bow- 
ever, in all probability been employed as a pipe, as it is badly cracked 
from heat.

A similar coucretion (Cat. No. 13G978, U.S.N.M.) was found in a 
mound in Mason County, West Virginia, by Mr. R. W. Mercer, which 
is 4 inches high with a width of 2^ inches, yelh)w in color, the stem 
being a hole one-eighth of an inch in diameter, broken through the 
shell midway of the natural bowl cavity. 

As demonstrating that this type of pipe was used quite recently, 
reference may be made to a specimen which was found in Haldeman's 
shell heap, near Baiubridge, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, in Con 
roy Township, on the Susquehanna Kiver, close to 
two trade pipes of English make. 

Rev. W. M. Beauchamp refers to a bowl pipe from 
Madison County, New York, having two stem holes, 
and Prof. G. IT. Perkins illustrates another from near 
Swan ton, Vermont.' 

Schoolcraft illustrates one of these bowl pipes, 
which is said to come from an ancient aboriginal 
grave in Michigan at Sault Ste. Marie, upon which a 
lizard has been carved in relief, with legs spread out 
to assist in climbing the bowl, above which the head 
extends on the far side from the stem, facing the 
smoker, the tail being continued under the bowl. 
The whole is skillfully executed.- 

A pipe in every way answering the description of 
the one referred to by Schoolcraft, and probably 
identical with it, is in the collection of Mr. A. E. 
Douglass, of New York. 

A large specimen of what appears to be intended for a pipe of this 
type (fig. 51) is composed of quite a hard, imperfectly crystallized 
quartzite. It was found in Franklin County, Indiana, and was col- 
lected by Dr. R. Haymond. It is 4;^ inches long, with a greatest 
diameter of 2i inches. There is upon the lower part of this barrel- 
shaped object an incipient stem. The exterior surface is comj)leted and 
ground evenly, though not finely, except at the top and bottom of the 
bowl, which yet remains rough, as left by the hammer marks. On top 
of the bowl there is a slight depression begun by pecking, as though 
intended lor the iecej)tion of the drill point. Though unfinished, this 
specimen is of more than passing interest, showing as it does the 
process of manufacture of objects of hard stone. 

Fig. 52 is a light green serpentine bowl from Accotink, Virginia, col- 
lected by Mr. J. D. Lucas. It is 3i inches high, with a greatest diam- 
eter of If inches, of cylindrical cross section. The bowl is 2 inches 
deep and five-eighths of an inch in diameter at the surface, having 
been drilled with a solid point and not subsequently enlarged, as is the

case with almost all American pipes. A peculiarity of this bowl is 
the unusually large size of the stem hole, which is quite as large as 
is the opening of the bowl itself, the walls varying from one-fourth to 
one half of an inch in thickness. Around tlie outer edge of the rim are 
twelve notches cut at equal distances; while a totemic figure has been 
scratched on the smooth surface opposite the stem, the significance of 
which it is impossible to determine. It consists of eight diverging 
straight lines, arranged in fan shape, from which one other straight 
line extends toward the top; from this latter line yet another one 
projects at an angle of 45 degrees, to the right and down; and two 
other lines diverge at a like angle on the left. The surface of this urn- 
shaped bowl was originally smoothed with unusual care, and its out- 
line is quite graceful, though the notches and at- 
tempt at totemic ornamentation are extremely crude. 
The form of this bowl is graceful, but the scratch- 
ing is not so rude as to suggest tliat in such pipes the 
art of the whites and the Indians is combined, the 
savage owner having added his barbaric decoration 
to the object received from the Europeans. Were 
this the case in a single instance it would be insignifi- 
cant, but as it is observable in dozens of cases it is 
tolerably conclusive evidence. 

Among bowl pipes of vase-like form they are found 
to vary from those which are as broad as they are 
long to specimens having a height four times as great 
as their diameter. Tliis type is usually made from 
steatite, or kindred stones, capable of resisting heat, 
though, as with almost all American pipes, there 
are numerous exceptions to the rule. One, in the 
Smithsonian collection, of gray sandstone was found 
in a cave on Tar Kiver, Yancy County, North Carolina, and another, 
found in a kitchen heap in Kanawha County, West Virginia, which was 
made from a brown stone. Other specimens are known of this type 
made from partially decomposed limestone, feldspar, and even fossil 
coral. The writer is informed by the Kev. W. M. Beauchamp that this 
type is frequently encountered in Onondaga County, New York. 

Pipes of this urn-shaped type are found also along the headwaters of 
the St. Lawrence, on the south shores of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, 
and along the upper waters of the Ohio and its affluents, a typical 
specimen being from Accotiuk, Virginia, while yet other specimens in 
the U. S, National Museum collection are from New York, Pennsyl- 
vania, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, and North 
Carolina. 

If the area of distribution of the urn-shaped pipe is compared with 
the tribal distribution first known to the whites, as it appears on 
Powell's linguistic map, it will be seen that this especial form of the

bowl pipe is fouud in Iroquoian territory on the north, tbrougli the 
Algonquin on the south, into the southern Iroiiuoians. It should be 
remembered that this area corresponds, reasonably, with the territory 
influenced by French trade before the advent of riie English. The 
territory also is in the line of travel from the 
St. Lawrence to the Ohio. The writer is un- 
able to determine how far tlie urn type of pipe 
has been governed by European induences. 
Its contour is similar to that of pottery bowls 
from Tennessee, specimens of which are in the 
U. S. National Museum collection. 

Fig. 53 is a rectangular steatite bowl from 
Sterling, Connecticut, collected by Mr. J. H. 
Clark. It is 2^ inches high, li inches long 
from front to back, though only five-eighths of 
an int'h from side to side. The incised three- 
sided groove shown in the figure is on both 
sides, and there can be no doubt was intended 
for the purpose of inlaying with metal or shell, 
probably the former. The markings radiating 
from the groove only appear on one side of the 
bowl. There is a hole bored through the base 
of this specimen from side to side, evidently 
intended to receive a string which would be attached to the stem. It 
appears to the writer that i)ipes with holes for attaching bowl and 
stem, or for whatever purpose the hole was intended, are much more 
common in the North than in the South, which may be because of the 
greater liability to loss in the snow than in the 
grass or among leaves. A pipe, liowever, some- 
what similar in general characteristics to this, 
in the collection of the University of Pennsyl- 
vania, is said to have come from North Carolina, 
though in place of the hole for the string there 
is a small knob on its base, as though intended 
for a similar purpose. 

Fig. 54, from Middleboro, Massachusetts, col- 
lected by Mr. S. H. Sylvester, is made of a steel- 
gray serpentine, and is apparently not alone 
intended to show the lizard crawling over the 
convex side of the bowl, but an incision on each 
side of the lower point would indicate an inten- 
tion to convey the idea of some animal's head 
The sharp edges of the lizard's body, legs, and 
head indicate the use of a metal tool in cutting the stone. Though the 
design is apparently of that character which is common among Indian 
pipes, the shape of the bowl cavity is quite unusual, being square, an 
uncommon circumstance, though elliptical openings are not rare.

ANIMAL HEAD PIPE.

Cat. No. 27038, U.S.N. M. Collected 
by T. H. Bean. 



It may be said with some degree of certaiuty that fig. 55 represents 
a dog, wolf, or fox. The ears of the animal are carved in relief and 
the lines rejiresenting the month are incised. This pipe is made of 
a steel-gray serpentine, collected by Dr. T. H. Bean from Lancaster 
County, Pennsylvania. The lines of ornamen- 
tation on this pipe are of the most primitive 
character and strictly in accordance with sav- 
age conventionalism, crossing each other in a 
manner common in Indian etchings, whereas 
the shape of the pipe itself is not without merit, 
being graceful and sufficiently accurate to give 
a fair idea of the animal intended. 

There is a cut under the neck of the creature 
which looks as though it were made with a 
metal blade, though it appears much more 
fresh than the rest of the work. There is 
uo other work upon this i^ipe which may not 
have been done with the most primitive imple 
ments. 

A difficulty constantly confronting archfeol- 
ogists is that discoverers of aboriginal speci- 
mens frequently scrape incisions with metal tools, making it extremely 
difficult to distinguish between old lines and new. 

This pipe has the bowl and stem hole of like size, each being approx- 
imately three-fourths of an inch in diameter at the surface, and there- 
fore resembles the cavities in the biconical r>ipes, 
though the latter are seldom, if ever, so small. 

Fig. 50, from Piqua, Miami County, Ohio, collected 
by Mr. C. T. Wiltheiss, is a curious pipe made of a 
light gray sandstone, in imitation of the head of 
some animal, thongh in this case, as in many others, 
it would be difficult to identify it. The mouth, ears, 
eyes, and nostrils are each distinctly shown, though 
the tool marks with which the work was done have 
been obliterated. In the collection of the University 
of Pennsylvania Museum there is the head of an 
animal, carved from a gray sandstone found in West 
Virginia, not dissimilar to the head here figured, the 
mouth of which is partly open, showing the tongue. 
Fig. 57 is a cast of a curious banded-slate bowl 
pipe from West Virginia, collected by Mr. B. H. 
Harrison. Upon the surface facing away from the 
smoker there is a rudely executed human face. The mouth is an 
incised straight line, as is the lower end of the nose, the eyes being 
indicated by slight depressions, evidently made with the point of a 
drill. Upon the cheeks of this face are a number of irregular figures

cut in parallel straight Hues, intended to represent tattoo marks or 
streaks of paint. 

This pii)e is 2 inches high, though from front to back it is less than 
half an inch thick, the bowl being so small that it would scarcely hold 
a thiniblefull of tobacco, the stera hole being so shallow as to i)revent 
a stem being attached without great difficulty. This pipe must be con- 
sidered rather in the nature of a freak than as belonging to any partic- 
ular tj^pe, and is more in accordance with savage art 
than are the many specialized objects. 

Fig. 58 represents a cast of a bowl found in San- 
dusky, Ohio, collected by Mr. Lewis Leppleman, and 
appears unique among pipes of this tj'pe. The fig- 
ure appears highly conventionalized, though it is sufQ- 
ciently well shaped to determine that a bird, possibly 
an owl, was intended. So far as may be determined 
from the cast, there is no work on this specimen which 
may not have been accomplished by means of the 
most primitive implements, even of stone or shell, and 
could be (luite easily executed with the aid of co[)per. 
JFig. 59 is yet another specimen of bowl pipe repre- 
sented in the U. S. IS^ational Mu- 
seum collection by a cast. It was 
collected near Valley Eiver, Mur- 
phy, North Carolina, by Gen. G. T. 
Wilder. It is difficult to determine 
what the head attached to the bowl was meant to rep- 
resent, though from the crescent-shaped lines on the 
sides of the bowl it is probably a bird. The head on 
this bowl is not unlike those on the projections of some 
of those ponderous pipes found often in Xorth Caro- 
lina and Tennessee, and coining from North Carolina 
is probably merely an evidence of a desire to pro- 
duce a unique si)ecimen, the bowl and stem cavities 
being respectively seven-eighths and five-eighths of 
an inch in diameter. 

Fig. 60 is a finely ground dark green serpentine 
bowl, which is quite similar to the preceding, though

finished. It is shaped to represent a bird s head, the 
eyes being indicated by circular incisions rudely cut and the beak 
being of a shape to suggest that an eagle or hawk was intended, though 
whatever the bird, it is rather of conventional than natural shape, 
the mouth being represented bj^ symmetrical curves corresponding on 
each side of the beak. The surface of this pipe is smoothed with such 
skill that all tool marks have been entirely obliterated, and while the 
surface is perfectly smooth, there has been no eftort made to polish it.

The striic left by the drill in boring it out are so sharply cut as to 
leave no room to doubt that the work was done with a tool of metal, 
quite likely of steel. 
The perfection of finish and artistic pose of the bird rei)resented in 

tig-, 01 should be good reason for consid- 
ering itone of the most perfect of Ameri- 
can pipes. It is made of a black serpen- 
tine collected in Mineral County, West 
Virginia, by Mr. J. A. Davis, and repre- 
sents some water bird, probably a swan 
or goose. The graceful pose of the head 
and neck of the bird is nearly perfect. 
It is represented in the act of dressing 
its feathers. Well down on the neck are 
nine sharply incised lines, each three- 
fourths of an inch long, all of them 
straight and parallel. The wings ex- 
tend well down on the body and are 
slightly raised above the surrounding 
surface. The breast has been brought 
to a high polish. Into the surface of it 
have been drilled about 150 small cir- 
cular depressions. These shallow holes 
are scattered without order, though they 
are nearly equidistant. While many aboriginal stone relics of the 
Indians are well ground and brought to a smooth surface, polish is of 
such rare occurrence that one is inclined to suspect white iuliueuces 
wherever it is encountered. Among Ameri- 
can implements it is probably more notice- 
able in the gray tubular serpentine horns 
from Ohio and West Virginia than in any 
other objects. It must be admitted there is 
no work upon this pipe, if we except its pol- 
ish, which could not be done with primitive 
tools, though there is doubt if it is purely 
aboriginal. 

There is in the collection of casts of the 

U. S. National Museum (Cat. No. 22176) one 

from Scioto County, Ohio, much on the order 

of the swan pipe, which was intended possi- 

)ly I/O represent a loon. 

Pipes, generally of local types, appear to 
be found throughout the continent under 
similar conditions of surroundings to that of other aboriginal objects, 
on the surface, in shell heaps, in graves of all kinds, among the Pueblo 
ruins, in the mounds, and in the caves. Even the English trade pipe

has been found 6 or more feet below the surface of the earth associated 
with implements of the age of stone. 

The Rev. W. M. Beauchamp, thoroughly competeut to express an opin- 
ion on the subject, and especially familiar with the aboriginal remains 
and implements of New York, considers that the pipes of stone, of which 
the larger part of New York speci- 
mens are composed, are compara- 
tively recent. Until the coming of 
the whites most New York pipes were 
of clay, the Narragansetts making 
those of stone, but with the use of steel 
tools stone pipes became common. 
Catlinite pipes, other certainly than 
the plain rectangular Siouan ones, are 
probably quite modern, for that mate- 
rial seems to have been almost un- 
known far from the Siouan sphere of 
influence until near the close of the 
seventeenth century. 

Fig. 62 belongs apparently to the bowl pipes, and is made of a brown 
pottery well mixed with a tempering of iiounded shell; it is 2| inches 
high, and from the outer edge of the short stem to the far side of the 
pipe is the same length; the interior of the bowl has a diameter of 1| 

inches, with a depth of only 1 inch; the 
stem hole, one-half the diameter of the 
bowl, is 1:^ inches deep. The dimensions 
here given would suggest that ]>ossibly 
this pipe should be classed rather with 
the bicouical or monumental pipe than 
with those of the bowl tj'pe. This ob- 
ject is from Mount Vernon Barracks, 
Alabama, collected by Dr. Joseph K. 
Corson. The clay and tempering mate- 
rial are well mixed together, while the 
ornamentation as well as the manner of 
producing it are unique; the base is ilat 
and smooth; the design on the bowl is 
in relief about one eighth of an inch and 
covers the whole surface, there being 
a number of notches cut around the 

Corson. 

top of the bowl and the rim of the stem. 
As a pipe the design is pleasing, the stem socket being the most pro- 
nounced of any of this type; the ornamented surfaces are compara- 
tively smooth, while between the lines in relief, the depressed sur- 
face appears to have been made by means of a scraping or cutting 
tool, the strife of which are quite distinct and appear to have been pro- 
duced by having the bowl, when originally burned, of a uniform surface,

upon whicli the design has been traced, and all tlie rest of the surface 
scraped or gouged away, leaving the original surface in low relief. 
A quaint pipe, made of the base of a deer's antler sawed off where it 
joins the skull, is shown in tig. 63, from Fort Wran- 
gel, Alaska, collected by Lieut. F. M. Ring, United 
States Navy. The person who made this pipe has 
taken advantage of natural form to the fullest ex- 
tent in leaving the original horn to represent a 
head covering, or the individual's hair. This gro- 
tesque carving is reversible and not devoid of 
humor, something frequently observed in the carv- 
ings and etchings of the Northwest coast. The 
specimen is evidently modern and made with 
modern iron tools, though the characteristics are 
peculiar to the Northwest coast. 

Fig. 64 j)resents a combination of savagery and 
civilization, nature and art, and the present blended 
with hoary antiquity in a manner than which it 
were difficult to imagine a more remarkable and 
striking example. It is from Pottawatomie, 
Kansas, collected by the National Institute, and 
is about 4 inches high and made of the outer whorl 
of an ammonite (i^robably Schkenhachia peruviana, or aeiiticarinata), 
the shape of which attracted the curiosity of the Indians. Broken 
in three pieces, it has been carefully repaired 
by means of plates of iron on each side, 
w^hicli are held in jiosition by rivets running 
from plate to plate through the fossil. The 
face, while rude, is reasonably well modeled 
and carefully smoothed, and i^reseiits the 
Indian type. Indeed, the work has been so 
carefully executed as to leave some doubt 
whether a part of this object, that comi^rising 
the head, has not been artificially built up and 
molded rather than carved from the ammonite. 
There is no reason to suppose this specimen to 
be of any considerable age, though it is typi- 
cally Indian. 

Pipes of similar shape to those here figured 
of the bowl type have been found in many of 
tlie States of the Union, though with few excep- 
tions they are noted east of the Mississippi 
lliver, and there is no pipe so difficult to place 

in its jiroper area as this form; for while certain of them are undoubt- 
edly quite old, others of the same type are certainly of modern work- 
manship.

Schoolcraft refers to one of these pipes on which .1 head is carved 
on the bowl, while on another a lizard is rei)reseuted crawling up the 
outside. ' 

Lapham refers also to a bowl pipe found in a mound in Wisconsin, 
made of argillite. which presents the unusual feature of having a hori- 
zontal opening on both sides.- 

Dr. E. A. Barber refers also to a large stone council pipe belonging 
to Mr. W. S. Vaux, of Philadelphia, found in a grave in West Phila- 
delphia, which was discovered with a necklace of stone beads, the pipe 
beiug 6 inches high, cylindiical, and tapering in form. About ii inches 
from the base, which is 8f| inches in circumference, extends a horizontal 
groove in which have been pierced four equidistant stem holes which 
extend obliquely downward to the base of the bowl.^ 

Prof. W. H. Holmes called the writer's attention to a bowl pipe made 
of earthenware, found by Mr. Henry P. Hamilton, at Two Rivers, Wis- 
consin, apparently intended to represent the bloom of the tobacco 
l)lant or possibly an orchid, of beautiful shape, symmetrical in every 
way, suggesting modern influences though found associated with 
undoubted aboriginal implements. 

Prof. G. H. Perkins also has figured a dark steatite pipe, found on 
Grand Isle, in Lake Champlain, which he considers one of the most 
interesting of all the pipes of Vermont, having faces carved upon it in 
bold relief, with two lines running one from either side of the nose of 
these faces, and Professor Perkins says there is only one other i)ipe 
having a face carved upon it in the Champlain Valley, and " singu- 
larly this face also has lines under the nose, which may indicate the 
mustache of a European."'' 

A pipe of somewhat similar character, made from alabaster, having 
two faces upon the upper edge of the bowl, is in the Douglass collec- 
tion, New York City, and was found in Wyandot County, Ohio. Still 
another stone pipe of this character froiu Texas, collected by Hon. 
George M. Keim (Cat. No. 0672, U.S.N.M.), has four faces carved on the 
upper edges of the bowl, which is somewhat broken. Around the sides 
of the Jaws of this pipe, however, are striae which have every appear- 
ance of being made with a hie, and the hole for the stem is dispropor- 
tionately large compared with the opening of the bowl. 

While such may exist in museums or private collections, the writer 
has not encountered any reference to this type of bowl form made 
from i)otter3\ It is difficult to see how the majority of pipes of this 
type were attached to their steins because of the thinness of the wall 
of the bowl and the wide opening of the stem hole, which, because of 
being drilled with a solid j)oint, is so shallow at its entrance into the

bowl that it leaves no i^urchase or room to attach a stem by merely 
foreiiifi' it in tight. This suggests that stems were attached by means 
of rawhide strips Avra])ped around bowl and stem while wet and allowed 
to dry, whereby the stem and bowl would be held together in a manner 
as perfect as possible. 

There appears scarcely a limit to the variations of this type, which 
was shaped chiefly to suit individual tastes, and was of a form handy 
to carry. One coming under the writer's notice was made from a pistol 
cartridge, having a bird-bone stem, held in position by rawhide tight- 
ened in the manner above suggested. 

It would require a book to itself to attempt thoroughly to treat the 
subject of pipestems — their decoration, and the material from which 
they are made, which would include stone, bone, horn, ivory, wood, 
and quills. Some of the pipes were apparently smoked without stems 
separate from the pipes, notably the curved base pipes of the mounds, 
though even they may jiossibly have had quill stems attached. 

Tubular pipes were generally smoked by means of bone, wood, or even 
stone stems, inserted in the smaller end of the tube, as is indicated by 
its interior enlargement. In California, and among the Pueblos and 
cliif dwellers, these mouthpieces were held in position by means of 
bitumen or gum, though there is little direct evidence as to the method 
employed in the eastern portion of the United States to hold the tubu 
lar i)ipestems in place; similarity in shape of tube would suggest like 
methods. Pij)estems of wood — round, flat, curved, bent, and carved, 
long and short — are common from the Eocky Mountains to the Atlantic 
Ocean, the Indian being governed in the character of stem largely by 
the supply of material in the territory to whicli he had access either 
personally or through trade. Reeds and jointed roots would naturally 
be emi)loyed where available; before the arrival of the whites with 
their metal, the proposed stem would have to be split thrcmgh longi- 
tudinally; the joints on the inside being removed, the split pieces could 
be glued together again or bound with bark or hide. The stems, if of 
wood, would be split in the same manner and each of the split pieces, 
after having a narrow channel cut along its entire length, could be 
rejoined, when the channels would form a tubular opening from end to 
end of the stem, allowing free passage to the smoke. These split pieces, 
when not refitting satisfactorily, often had strips of hide or bark glued 
to the crack, when they would be bound in the usual manner. 

Judging from such descriptions of pipestems as have been ])reserved 
to us through various publications, it will be observed that from the 
time of the earliest French and English contact with the natives, pipe- 
stems have been highly ornamented and often decorated with bright 
colors, feathers, fur, and dyed hair, and more recently with bright 
flannel of various shades and large-headed brass or silver nails driven 
into smooth surfaces in rows or scrolls. The ornamentation of the stems 
of ceremonial pipes appears to have hadgreat significance, for not only 



AMERICAN AHORTGINAL I'IPKS AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 437 

could oue thereby determine to what tribe tliey belonged, but could even 
decide at a glance whether the one bearing it came on a friendly or hos- 
tile mission. The very early pipes, especially those referred to by the 
French, we know were red, white, or black, and we rarely find allusions 
to ornamentation of their bowls, but when we do it refers to color; 
whereas particulars are usually gone into in reference to the stem, tlie 
color of feathers composing the decoration, the birds composing them, 
or how a hoop of hair was attached to the stem and arranged. 

The pipe among many of the tribes appears to have protected its 
bearer so long as he was on his errand, even among bitter enemies. 
That the pipe had the sanctity commonly attributed to it by early 
writers is demonstrably inaccurate, for there are numerous records of 
the pipe bearers not being received, and even of receiving them and 
subsequently of escorting them a certain distance from camp and then 
knocking them in the head with scant ceremony. 

All wooden pipe stems are not round; some are flattened parallelo- 
grams, others are triangular, ellipsoidal, or even square; some are soft, 
being made of the quills of birds; others are of stone and of a size offer- 
ing diflBculties in inserting them in the smokers' mouth. 

The angle of bowl to stem varies from those in which both are in a 
common plane to those in which bowl and stem are parallel to each 
other. 

Mr. W. H. Dall relates that "the Hudsons Bay men make passable 
pipe stems by taking a straight-grained piece of willow or spruce 
without knots and cutting through the outer layers of bark and wood. 
This stick is heated in the ashes, and by twisting the ends in contrary 
directions the heart wood may be gradually drawn out, leaving a 
wooden tube.'" 

Hind describes a unique pipe used on a certain occasion by a Gree 
Indian. "I asked," he says, "what he would do for a smoke until he 
had finished the new pipe. He arose and walking to the edge of the 
swamp cut four reeds and joined some pieces together. After he had 
made a hole through the joints, he gently pushed one extremity in a 
slanting direction into the earth, which he had previously made firm by 
pressure with his foot. He then cut out a small hole in the clay, above 
the extremity of tiie reed, and molding it with his fingers, laughingly 
said, 'Now give me tobacco, and I will show you how to smoke it.' He 
then filled the hole with a mixture of tobacco and the bearberry, placed 
a live coal on the top, and stretching himself at full length on the 
ground, with his chin supported by both hands, he took the reed 
between his lips and enjoyed a long smoke." - 

While this pipe was certainly most primitive, we have an account of 
one yet more simple, the description of which is taken from a recent 
newspaper clipping given the writer, in which a glimpse is shown of a

Kaffir pipe, and a native smoking it to produce stupefaction, as many 
American tribes have done, and yet do. "He, the Kaffir, first pours 
a little water on the ground and makes a sort of mud pie; he then 
takes a limber twig and bends it into the shape of the bow; this he 
buries in the mud in such a way that both ends ])rotrude a little at the 
surface. He then waits a little for the mud to harden. When he con- 
siders the pie is done to a turn, he pulls out the twig, which of course 
leaves a curved hole through the clay. At one end he scoops out a 
sort of bowl, in which he places his tobacco; at the other end he 
fashions a little mound to serve as a mouthpiece. He drops a live coal 
on the tobacco in the bowl, lies flat on the ground, applies his thick 
lips to the orifice and sucks away. He mixes with it a liberal quantity 
of dagha, a kind of hemp with intoxicating qualities, similar to those 
of hasheesh. By the time the pipe is finished the smoker falls over in 
a fit." 

The Igorottes, or mountaineers of Formosa, who are head hunters, 
have a curious custom relating to the pipe. They watch the coast 
dwellers coming in search of wood, who are attacked and decapitated ; 
when heads to a certain number have been taken by one of them, "he 
obtains by way of honor the right to sell pipes," ' which are little bits 
of wood representing human heads. 

HEAVY ANIMAL AND BIRD PIPES. 

We have in fig. 65 a type specimen of the heaviest of any of the 
American Indian pipes with which the writer is acquainted, and in 
fact the only one so far discovered which would fully serve, from its 

size and weight, to 
"brain a man or a 
horse," and which was 
"three-quarters of a 
yard long." The one 
here illustrated is 
from Blount County, 
Tennessee, collected 
by Br. Blankinship. 
The bird represented 
may be either owl or 
parrot, probably the 
former, and differs 
from pipes of this 
type in having the stem hole in the breast of the bird. It is a light 
bottle-green chlorite, 10 inches long, 4A inches high, with a width of 2^ 
inches. The opening of the bowl is about 1^ inches in diameter, that 
of the stem being about three-fourths of an inch. The surface of this 
pipe is smoothly worked down except on the back, where the wings are

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 



There can be but little doubt that fig. 66 is a representation of a wild 
pigeon, a bird which but a few years ago migrated south iu the fall and 
north iu tlie spring to their breeding grounds. They were in such vast 
numbers as to break the limbs of the trees where they stopped to roost 

or to feed on acorns, and in their flight 
would obscure the face of the sun for 
hours at a time. This pipe was found 
in Decatur County, Tennessee, collected 
by Mr. W. M. Clark; it is 11 inches long, 
4 inches high, and the bowl is 2 inches 
in exterior diameter, the diameter of the 
interior of the bowl being 1| inches, 
and the opening of the stem, which is 
located under the tail of the bird, is 
about one- half the diameter of the bowl ; 
and as a rule this proportion of the bowl 
and stem holes will hold good in the 
I type. The head and body of this bird 
I "1 are tolerably well formed, though the 
fc I a wings, it may be seen, are treated in a 
g S 1 purely conventional manner, crossing 
I I I on the back near their points, the bird 
, o ^ ^. being carved from a black chlorite. 
g I ^ The eyes of these birds are depressed, 
< " S though it would be difficult to say 
S I I whether it was intended in any case to 
^ ° insert artificial ones. The pigeon, like 
« the buffalo, has disappeared so com- 
pletely from its former haunts, that one 
would hardly know which way to turn 
to obtain a specimen were it desired 
for a collection. 

Unfortunately the specimen is broken, 
yet what remains of fig. 07 is an un- 
usually spirited example of the wood 
duck — of all American birds the one 
with the most beautiful plumage. It 
is of steatite, from Cumberland County, 
Tennessee, is 1) inches long, 4 inches 
high, and 4.4 inches wide; and was col- 
lected by Mr. Lorenzo A. Stratton. The 
break of this pipe is through its plane of cleavage, and as the speci- 
men has been completed the break has occurred since it was finished. 
The crest and legs of the bird, the latter poorly executed, leave no 
doubt that the wood duck was intended. The feathers are rudely 
designated on the wings in wavy lines with the point of some rude 
tool, possibly of stone.

AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SISIOKING CUSTOMS. 441 

It is remarkable that the stems of certain of these pipes are so worn 
on their outside as to indicate that they have come in direct contact 
with the teeth of the sniolver, though the ordinary interior stem eidarge- 
nient is similar to that of the elongated conical pipes of California. 
Lannian ])robably referred to a pipe of this character, found in 1848 or 
earlier, 15 feet below the surface, in Macon County, Xorth Carolina, 
made in injitation of a duck." A broken specimen from Ohio above 
Cincinnati is in the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania. 

Fig. (>8, from Jackson County, North Carolina, collected by Mr. G. A. 
Jacobs, is an unusually large specimen of an unfinished pipe, made of 
steatite, which is 19 inches long, 4 inches high, and 3 inches wide, and 
weighs 9f pounds, and used as a weapon would really be terrible. 

There are few surface indications showing the striae of the tools with 
which these imi)lemeuts were originally made, and it is impossible to 
say Irom an examination of many specimens whether stone or metal 
tools were used, as the surfaces have been smoothed ofl". As the shape 
of this pipe is perfect, it would 
indicate that it was intended 
for use in its present condition. 
If, however, it vras intended 
that the bowl and stem were to 
be bored out, which was prob- 
ably the case, it would indi- 
cate that this was one of those 

"great pipes" to which refer- B'ig. o9.

the Size 01 which distinguishes 

them from ])ipes intended for individual use. Pi])es of this type vary 
from G to 10 inches in length, and are apparently totemic. One specimen 
111 the U. S. National Museum (Cat. No. 34383), from Anderson County, 
Tennessee, collected by ^Ir. W. H. Taylor, has a head on it, but it is 
impossible to determine whether it represents a turtle or a bird, though 
the head in the last illustration was probably that of a dog or wolf. 
Another specimen, representing an animal, has the legs cut out in low 
relief, so that they h)ok as if they were made of sej)arate pieces subse- 
quently glued to the surface. 

Though differing in several respects from the preceding specimens, 
fig. 69 appears in bowl and stem characteristics to belong to the type 
here described, though it is made of a dark, almost black, chlorite. It is 
from western Tennessee, collected by Mr. W. M. Clark, and is 6 inches 
long. 3 inches high, and 2i inches wide, and represents a bowl being 
held in six lingers of a left hand. The knuckles and nails are all well 
represented. A similar specimen, though of pottery, from Arkansas, 
will be found among the biconical pipes (fig. 162), where this would

have been placed were it not that the size of the stem opening and of 
the opening of the bowl were so typical of these heav^' pipes. Another 
hand, hohling some object, is in the Sterner collection, from the Etowah 
mound, Georgia. Tliruston in his Antiquities of Tennessee represents 
a pipe of this general type, the figure being a bird with outstretched 
wings,' and another in which the bird is on its back, the bowl protrud- 
ing from its breast.'^ One specimen represents the human foot and a 
part of the leg, the bowl coming out on the shin bone near the instep.^ 
In this specimen the toes are well carved. 

The occurrence of the hand, arm, foot, and leg in pipes of this type 
would suggest that they were exceptions to the general rule and have 
no totemic significance. 

In many of its characteristics fig. 70 would appear to belong to this 
type, yet in some respects there are features which Avould possibly 

entitle it to be classed ii» an 
indeterminate group. This 
pipe is from Chillicothe, 
Ohio, collected by Dr. E. H. 
Davis, and has the body and 
wings of a bird, with the 
head of a man facing to the 
right of the smoker; and an 
enlargement along the back 
of the man's head and neck 
is suggestive of the old- 
fashioned cue of the whites. 
The stem of the pipe enters 
the bowl, intersecting it at 
right angles, and is perforated through the wing instead of under the 
tail, as is commonly the case. A clay pipe, representing a panther 
facing to the right, is among the Iroquoian pipes and other specimens 
of men and birds or beasts are from New York and Ontario, and a bird 
on a mound pipe from Illinois faces also to the right. 

Old Chillicothe, on the Little Miami River in Ohio, is the place to 
which Daniel Boone, in 1780, says he was carried a prisoner by the French 
and Indians, by whom he was captured, though while a prisoner he 
appears to have been treated with unusual consideration, the king of 
the Sliawnees, lie says, having adopted him.^ 

Squier and Davis illustrate a pipe of this general character, though 
of the tubular type, bowl and stem being in the same plane, upon which 
a bird is carved with its back attached to the tube, found in a mound 
on the Catawba River, Chester District, South Carolina, the specimen

beiug 10 inches long and 2 inches wide, weighing a little less than 4 
pounds.^ 

While steatite appears to be the most common mineral employed in 
making these pipes, chlorite and serpentine were also used at times. 
An examination of the dimensions of bowls and pipes of the American 
Indians demonstrates almost conclusively that the size of bowl and 
stenj are in relative proportion through contiguous territory, with 
scarcely an exception in any given type, though material and exterior 
finish vary (considerably. Gen. A. L. Pridemore has a pipe of this type, 
having upon it the head of an eagle, and another a duck, from Lee 
County, Virginia, which he considers of Cherokee origin. Mr. A. F. 
Berlin, of AUentown, Pennsylvania, has a white stone pipe, a surface 
find, from Franklin Couut}^, jSTorth Carolina, in the shape of a duck, the 
bowl of which is rectangular. The University of Pennsylvania has a 
bird pipe catalogued from Georgia, and a specimen of this type in the 
Douglass collection from Cumberland County, Kentucky, has engraved 
upon its side the figures 1714. The wings, tails, and topknots of birds 
in this type are usually highly conventionalized, and in only one instance 
does the writer recall an effort having been made to rei^resent individual 
feathers, and even in that case the work was quite rudely done. 

Pipes of this kind are of the most ponderous character of any Amer- 
ican type known, and Strachey's description of the pipe would really 
answer for this, and he does not exaggerate when he says the pipe of a 
"Susquehannock Indian" was "three-quarters of a yard long, prettily 
carved with a bird, a deare, or with some such device at the great end 
sufficient to beat out the braynes of ahorse,"- though he has evidently 
copied John Smith's earlier description, who asserted that these pipes 
M'ere sufficient to beat out a man's brains.^ 

This pipe appears also to be the only one which satisfactorily answers 
John Smith's description of having carvings at their great ends. 

USE OF PIPES AND TOBACCO BY THE WHITES. 

English and American authors usually give to Sir Walter Raleigh 
the credit of introducing tobacco into Europe about the year 1586, 
though it is highly probable the French had used it at an earlier date; 
the Spanish certainly used it even earlier than the French. 

In 1585 Sir ilichard Grenville had command of the expedition of Sir 
Walter Raleigh, consisting of seven sail, an account of which we have 
from the pen of Ralph Lane, one of the captains of the fleet. In 158G 
Sir Francis Drake also visited the colony of Virginia, from which time 
the coast of the continent became familiar to European sailors.

444 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

Among discoverers of the coast prior to IGIO, as mentioned by Henry 
Ellis, were Capt. John White in 1587, B.Gosnell in 1602, George Wey- 
mouth in 1G02, Hendrick Hudson in 1607,^ and John Smith in 160G 
and 1608. All of whom were of course preceded by the Spanish and 
Ribault made the coast of Florida in 1562 with a French expedition, 
who, after discovering the St. Johns liiver, went up the coast to Port 
Eoyal, located a fort, and returned to Europe. The garrison cpiar- 
reled, and Laudoniere in 1564 again reached the coast with liibault. 
The third French expedition carried a thousand men or more, all of 
whom, it is asserted, were massacred the same year by the Sjianiards, 
who a few years later were themselves massacred by Gorgues, a French- 
man. These people were followed by a host of minor adventurers whose 
names have not survived, and all we know of them is from some casual 
remark of a certain number of sail being in port, or it may be some 
writer referring to objects of European manufacture being in the Indians' 
possession which could only have come from a wreck. From about 1610 
the American continent became the storehouse which supplied material 
for European adventurers. They fished the waters and roamed the 
woods in search of peltries, especially those of the- mink, the beaver, 
and the otter, which they trapped or bought with trinkets of white 
man's manufacture always made for aboriginal trade or exchange. 
Almost annually, beginning with lialeigh's expedition, voyages doubled 
in number, and after the year 1600 Spanish, French, English, and Dutch, 
regular traders and pirates, fought and schemed against each other, 
often publishing erroneous reports, and it is even asserted going to the 
extent of issuing false maps for the purpose of misleading their rivals. 
The Spanish and French on the coast of Florida and the Carolinas 
cut each other's throats until they both abandoned their possessions. 
Subsequently the English occupied the Carolinas, and on the north- 
ern coast French, Dutch, and English were repeatedly guilty of the 
rankest acts of piracy upon each other. The French settled in Can- 
ada, and the Dutch held tenaciously to the trade of New York, and 
tobacco became a most important article of merchandise over the greater 
part of the continent. Gaftarel claims that Thevet, a Frenchman, 
is entitled to the credit of introducing tobacco into France as early 
as 1554.^ 

On the other hand, it is asserted that tobacco was first brought into 
Europe in 1558 by Francisco Fernandez, a physician who had been 
sent by Philip II of Spain to investigate the products of Mexico.^ 

Jean Nicot, ambassador of Francis II to Don Sebastian, King of 
Portugal, about 1559, sent seeds of the tobacco plant to Queen Cath- 
erine De Medici, and his services were commemorated by the scieu-

tific name Kicoiiana. According to Nadaillac the Spauiards and Pcrtu- 
guese introduced tobacco into Europe in 1518. Cortez sent seeds of 
the phint tc Charles V. Ealeigh oft'ered tobacco as a present to Queen 
Elizabeth in 158G, whence the use of it spread to Holland, then to the 
numerous colonies of these two countries, and thence with a strange 
rapidit}' to Asia, Africa, and the limits of the habitable world.' 

William IJragge calls attention to a matter which could not fail to 
impress any one at all familiar with the subject that " the early bibliog- 
raphy of tobacco develops the fact that its introduction was greatly 
facilitated by the supposed benefits which its use would afford the 
individual from a medicinal standpoint.''^ 

Bragge's collection of pipes, now in the British Museum, made from 
all parts of the world, and his books relating to tobacco, the former 
consisting of 13,000 specimens and the latter of 500 volumes was as 
rich as it was curious, and has probably never been equaled. The 
medicinal and imaginary properties attaching to tobncco have been 
marked among the American Indians to no greater extent than in 
Europe. Eeinbert Dodoens in 1578 said " the perfume of dryed leaves, 
he sayd he layde upon quick coles taken in the mouth through the 
pipe of a funnel or tunnel, helpeth such as are troubled with short- 
ness of winde and fetch their breath thicke and often.'' ^ 

Thomas Hariot, who accompanied Raleigh's expedition to Virginia in 
1584, says: " there is an herbe which is sowed apart by itself and is 
called by the Indians uppowoc; in the West Indies it hath divers 
n:imes, according to the several places and countries where it groweth 
and is used. The Spaniards generally call it tobacco. The leaves 
thereof dried and brought into powder they use to take the fume 
thereof by sucking it through pipes made of clay into their stomach 
and head; from whence it purgeth superfluous fleame and other gross 
humors, and openeth all the pores and passages of the body, by which 
means the use thereof not only preserveth the body from obstructions 
but also (if any be, so that they have not been of too long continu- 
ance) in short time breaketh them whereby their bodies are notably 
preserved in health and know not many grievous diseases wherewith 
we in England are oftentimes afflicted."^ 

This is probably the first reference to the use of tobacco by an 
Englishman, and even at the present time such an indorsement of the 
virtues of a newly discovered plant by a distinguished authority could 
not fail to be an invaluable advertisement for its use, for Hariot, who 
carried the tobacco plant to his patron, lialeigh, a favorite at the court

of Queen Elizabeth, appears to have been a botanist of some repute. 
That nariot's views concerning the wonderful properties of tobacco 
were not concurred in by all there can be no doubt, for "it was feared," 
says Camden, "that by the practice of smoking tobacco Anglorum 
corpora in harbor inn degencrasse rideantur.''^^ 

"Lane and his associates" [of Ealeigh's expedition], says Robertson, 
"by their constant intercourse with the Indians, had acquired a relish 
for their favorite enjoyment of smoking tobacco. They brouglit with 
them a specimeu of this new commodity to England and taught their 
countrymen the method of nsing it."- 

This is reiterated by Stith, who adds that Raleigh is said to have 
taken a pipe of tobacco a little before he went to the scaffold, and quotes 
Camden as thinking that Lane and his associates carried the first 
tobacco to England, and says : " Sir Walter Raleigh, a man of gaiety and 
fashion, readily gave in to it, and by his interest and example soon 
brought it into such vogue at court that many great ladies, as well as 
noblemen, made no scruple sometimes to take a pipe. It is certain the 
Queen gave great countenance and encouragement to it as a vegetable 
of singular strength and power, which might therefore prove of benefit 
to mankind and advantage to the nation."^ 

There are many anecdotes connected with Raleigh and his use of 
tobacco, none of which has been oftener repeated than the following: 
"Sir Walter was smoking in his study, and, being thirsty, called for his 
servant to bring him a tankard of beer. Jack hastily obeyed, and Sir 
Walter, forgetting to cease smoking, was in the act of spouting a volume 
of smoke from his mouth when his servant entered. Jack, seeing his 
master smoking prodigiously at his mouth, thought no other but he 
was all on fire inside, having never seen such a phenomenon in all 
England before, dashed a quart of liquor at once in his face, and ran 
out screaming, ' Massa's afire ! Massa's afire ! ' "^ 

On another occasion " Sir Walter wagered with the Queen that he 
would determine exactly the weight of smoke which went off in a pipe 
of tobacco. This he did by first weighing the tobacco and then care- 
fully preserving and weighing the ashes ; and the Queen readily granted 
that what was wanted in the prime weight must be evaporated in smoke. 
And when she paid the wager she said pleasantly that she had heard 
of many laborers in the fire that turned their gold into smoke, but 
Raleigh was the first who turned his smoke into gold."^

1500, that the supposed medicinal properties of tobacco had much to 
do iu promoting its use. 

Into the woods thencpfortli in baste she went, • 

To seeke for hearbes that mote him remedy; 

There whether divine tobacco were, 

Or pauachaea, or Polygeny, 

She found and brought it to ber patient deare; 

The soveraino weede betwixt two marbles plaine 

She pownded small and did in peeces bruze ; 

Then atween her lilly bandes twaine

Paul Hetzner, who visited England in 1508, says, as quoted by Fair- 
holt: "At these spectacles and everywhere else the English are con- 
stantly smoking tobacco, and in this manner: They have jiipes on 
purpose made of clay, into the further end of which they put the herbe 
so dry that it may be rubbed into powder, and putting fire to it they 
draw the smoke into their mouths, which they puff out again .through 
their nostrils like funnels."^ 

Aubrey, in 1000, speaking of Raleigh being the first one to popularize 
tobacco in England, says : " In our part of North Wilts, e. g., Malmsbury 
Hundred, it came first into fashion by Sir Walter Long. They had first 
silver pipes; the ordinary sort made use of a walnut shell and a straw. 
I have heard my grandfather Lyte say that one pipe was handed from 
man to man round the table." ^ 

Of all pipes referred to none appears more primitive than this straw 
and shell, though it is an additional evidence that to obtain the smoke 
its votaries will employ anything available to hold the tobacco. 

"In IGOl Mr. Secretary Cecil, in a speech, alludes to the then existing 
monopoly enjoyed by the tobacco pipe makers' guild, which, however, 
was not regularly incorporated until 1610."^ 

At Elizabeth Island, in IGOL', Gosuoll says " no place yields finer 
tobacco than this island."^ 

The English were looking to the cultivation of tobacco as a source of 
revenue, for it must be evident the whites were eager to trade with the 
natives for their iieltries, than which nothing brought greater profit 
and naturally few things had more solid value than a supply of their 
favorite plant. 

The English clay pipe of commerce, or the "trade pipe," as it is more 
commonly called, which is often found on Indian village sites, both i n and 
on the aboriginal shell heaps of the Atlantic coast, as well as in Indian 
graves throughout a large part of the territory near the middle Atlantic

seaboard, was, immediately upon its introductiou, eagerly bought by 
the ludiaiis and was also imitated in primitive pottery, tbe clay of 
wbicb was mixed with shells. This was certainly the case along the 
shores of the Chesapeake Bay during the first half of the seventeenth 
century. There was, however, in 1G05 an insufficient suijply of molded 
pipes among rlie natives, judging from a remark of Weymouth, who, 
referring to those of primitive form in latitude 41^° on the Atlantic 
seaboard, says they were "sometimes made of earth, sometimes of the 
claw of a lobster; but t'was always something that would hold ten or 
twelve of ours.'" 

This remark, however, evidences that the English had a i)articular 
pipe; that it was of diminutive size, and held scarcely more tlian a 
thimbleful of tobacco. 

To such an extent was the use of tobacco carried that every effort 
was made to suppress it, not alone because its odor was to some objec- 
tionable, but because of the vast sum which in the aggregate went into 
its purchase and was dissipated in smoke. The opposition became one 
of statesmen and of the church; and rigorous laws were passed to sup- 
press its importation into Europe, and severe penalties were imposed 
on those found smoking in public. There is a certain uniformity in the 
character of the English trade pipe, the type varying only in the angle 
of the bowl with the stem, the bowl eventually increasing from quite 
a diminutive size to its present dimensions. The exterior of these 
trade pipes are interesting in that they were stamped to suit the maker's 
fancy, all being molded from a clay which turned white on burning, 
and on the fiat heels of which the owner's name or initial was often 
impressed in the clay mold. Sometimes, however, it was more elabo- 
rate, as for example a man on horseback, a lily, or other device. Later 
these designs were transferred to the sides of the bowl, one coming 
under the writer's observation having upon one side of the bowl a 
figure evidently representing St. George and the dragon, and upon the 
opposite side Britannia and the lion. This pipe was found in the shell 
heap under the old French fort at Castine, Maine. Again the represen- 
tation would be a rose or other flower, and yet more recently the name 
is found impressed on the stem. All these stami)s were intended evi- 
dently as advertisements of the particular ware or output of a given 
factory. The smaller pipes are supposed to be the more ancient by 
those who have given this feature great attention. The writer is 
inclined to concur in this opinion from the fact that the most diminutive 
pipes of the trade type are those which have bowl and stem nearest 
approaching the straight tube, for during the last two hundred and fifty 
years the shape has gradually changed until the bowl is at present at 
right angles to the stem. The small size of the bowl was due to the 
scarcity and value of the dried plant, its enormous cost being a result

of the mauy restrictions on its use. The importation of tobacco into 
England was discouraged by enormous taxation, and there appears to 
have been a fear felt lest its use would not only impoverish the citizen, 
but that it was in addition liable to crij)ple the finances of the nation. 
There does not appear to be any positive knowledge as to the form of 
the earliest English i)ipes, consequently we are forced to a comparison 
of known English forms with those of the supposed primitive pipe 
from which the English clay pipe is copied. The heel of the pipe became 
in time a shar[) spur, that decreased until it is now scarcely discernible. 

Dr. E. A. Barber refers to a trade pipe with the initials R. T. on its 
heel, which was found in an Indian grave in Chester Countj^, Pennsyl- 
vania, probably the manufacture of one Richard Taylor, of Bath, Eng- 
land; and another was found in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.' 

The writer possessed a heeled clay pipe which w as found, while dig- 
ging a well, G feet under the surface in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. 
A similar one was found in an Indian grave in Montgomery County, 
New York. They have also been found by Mr. Frey, of Palatine Bridge, 
New York, in Indian graves.- 

The first tobacco-pipe maker in America of which there is record was 
Robert Cotton, whose name appears among those arriving in 1608 at 
Jamestown, Virginia, in the Phoenix, the first supply vessel.-^ 

Tobacco soon became the crop of Mrginia and Maryland, to the exclu- 
sion of those crops essential to sustain life, owing to its high price and 
scarcity. 

As has been remarked, the Indians at times used other idants than 
tobacco for smoking, just as in Scotland it was formerly said to be "com- 
mon for the old wives of Annandale to smoke a dried white moss," gath- 
ered on the neighboring moors, which they declared to be much sweeter 
than tobacco, and to have been in use before the American weed was 
heard of.* 

Percy, in 1607, speaks of the Indian of Virginia " with his arrow ready 
in his bow in one hand and taking a pipe of tobacco in the other, with 
a bold uttering of his speech, demanded of us our being there, willing 
us to begone." ■' 

Gabriel Archer, in 1607, speaks of the habitation of the " Great King 
Pawahtah," whose people gave us tobacco, which plant is referred to 
as among those grown by Powhatan.*^

Percy refers to an Indian pipe in 1G07, wbicli, lie says, "was artificially 
made of earth, as ours are, but far bigger, witb the bowl fashioned 
together with a piece of fine copper."' 

An offering of tobacco was made to the English in 1G07 at Dominico, 
within 14 degrees of the line, north latitude.^ 

It is difficnlt to understand what was intended by the expression 
" fashioned together with a piece of fine copi)er." Was it that the pipe 
had a bowl lined with copper, as is not uncommon with pipes of wood 
in the Northwest, or is the copper here referred to the tool with which 
the pipe was made? 

An extremely interesting stone pipe is in the collection of the museum 
of the University of Pennsylvania, which was found at Chelsea, Massa- 
chusetts. About half an inch of the stone stem has been broken off. 
The piece has been replaced and is firmly held in position by a thin 
copper band about an inch wide, which is neatly fitted around the stem, 
reaching above and below the fracture and holding it in place. 

Strachey refers to an offering of tobacco made to the expedition on 
the coast of Maine by "sixteen savages in three canoes;"^ and an 
offering of a similar character was made in 1608 to John Smith by the 
Susquehannock Indians, at the head of Chesapeake Bay, of " bows and 
arrows and tobacco pipes." One of these Indians, Smith says, had 
" the head of a wolf hanging in a chain for a jewel, his tobacco pipe, 
three-quarters of a yard long, prettily carved with a bird, a deare, or 
some such devise at the great end, and sufficient to beat out one's 
braiues, with bows, arrows, and clubs suitable to their greatness." '* 

Near the same lAsLce Smith encountered the Massowomekes, whose 
" targets, baskets, swords, tobacco pipes, platters, bows and arrows 
shewed they much excelled those of onr parts, and their dexterity in 
their small boats, made of the barks of trees, sowed with bark and 
well luted with gum, argueth that they are seated upon some great 
water." '-' 

These Massowomekes, the writer is informed by Mr. James Mooney, 
belonged to the Five Nations, people who commonly used birch bark, 
and whom we know were at that period living within touch of the 
French located on the St. Lawrence, or River of Canada, as it was then 
called, and who received their articles of metal directly from the French. 
Had the colonists followed the example of Smith and avoided the dis- 
putes and disagreements with which they were constantly burdened, 
they would have attained, as he has said, great happiness "had they

is small stability, there bein^ so many good commodities besides.'" 

H. Spellmau refers as early as 1009 to the pipe being used in the 
dance in Virginia. " They use," he says, " sports much like ours here in 
England, as their dancing, which is much like our Darbyshire horn- 
pipe, a man lirst and then a woman, and so through them all, hanging 
all in around. There is one which stands in the midst with a pipe and 
a rattle, which, when he begins to make a noise, all the rest giggetts 
ab<mt, wryiiig their necks and stamping on the ground." - 

This description of the dance of the Potomacs would apply to the 
dance of the Natchez ou the Mississippi ten years earlier or to that of 
the Sioux of to-day. 

Strachey describes "a clay the Indians call asseqiietU, whereof they 
make their tobacco pipes, which is more smooth and fyne than I have 
elsewhere seen any."^ A note identifies this assequeth with catlinite, 
though the assertion does not appear warranted by the facts. 

The natives of Maryland and those of the coast countries north and 
south of Maryland possessed a fine clay, from which pipes were nuide 
of a bright red color, exami)]es of which coming under the writer's 
observation would justify Strachey's remarks. He considered the 
tobacco of Virginia in 1012 inferior to that of "Trinidado" or of ''Ori- 
noque," growing 2 or 3 yards trom the ground, which the natives smoked, 
" stalk, leaves, and all, taking the same in pipes of earth, which very 
ingeniously they can make."* He also informs us that the unmarried 
Indian did not use tobacco. 

Smith calls the tobacco pipe "pawpecones," while Strachey says it 
was "apokan."^ 

William Parker, in 1615, shows that the pipe was extended in hospi- 
tality by the Indian to his visitor, for "the first thing Powhatan did he 
offered me a i^ipe of tobacco, then asked how his brother, Sir Thomas 
Dall, did."" 

The guild of tobacco-pipe makers was, according to Fairholt, incor- 
porated October 5, 1010.' 

By this time the cultivation of tobacco had become an extensive 
industry and the manufacture of pipes a regular trade. The arms of 
the tobacco-pipe makers' craft, which was displayed on all public occa- 
sions, was a growing tobacco plant, the private mark being on the heel

I^umbers of early Englisli pipes are found in and near London, at 
times as much as 12 feet below the present surface of the ground, wliich 
were smoked with tobacco, and very likely other plants, in tlie plague 
of 1604 and 1665, which carried otf so large a portion of the population 
of the city. 

Opinions have differed as to the antiquity of the tobacco 
Europe, though at present the weight of authority would 
opposed to the belief of any pre-Columbian 
tobacco pipes. In iigs. 71, 72, and 73 are 
presented three very primitive pipes, which, 
judging from the angle of the bowl with the 
stem, are as old as any form of English clay 
pipe which has come under the writer's ob- 
servation. They are drawn alter sketches 
furnished Dr. E. A. Barber by M. X. Cour- 
nault, of Malreville, near ISTancy, France. 
Fig. 71, which isof clay, isin the National Li- 
brary of Paris, and approaches closely the tubular form. Tlie lily upon 
the stem would indicate a French origin. Of fig. 72 less can be said ; its 
age would appear considerable, and it resembles a pipe figured by Baron 
Bonstetteu, as from Roman ruins in Switzerland. It is made of bronze. 
Fig. 73 is an iron pipe from Meurthe et Moselle, in the collection of M. 
Hutton, who has a similar si^ecimen from Camp de Chalons, Marne. 

Notwithstanding the finding of these bronze and iron pipes asso- 
ciated with remains of the Roman period,^ the writer is inclined to 
doubt that they are of an antiquity as great as supposed, 
though many persons are of diflereiit opinion. These 
metal pi[)es ditfer too slightly to justify their being 
con.sidered distinct from trade pipe forms. 

Fig. 74, here presented, was dug 
up ill the environs of London, and 
is of a hard-burned white clay upon 
which the mold mark is quite dis 
tinct. Uj)on the u j)per outside rim 
of the bowl are seen a number of 
small dots in a row encircling the bowl, forming the mill mark. This 
circle of dots is found on the English molded pipes of the seven- 
teenth century as well as on those of Dutch make. This bowl is cpiite 
small, holding less than one-half as much as fig. 75, also a pipe from 
ancient London. The cause of the reduction in the size of the bowl 
was i)robably owing to the restrictive legislation of the period of James 
I and the consequent enormously enhanced value of tobacco on account 
of its sui)posed wonderful medicinal virtues.

Fig. 70 is a molded pipe from Guda, Holland, collected by ^Iv. A. S. 
Gatschett, and has the same general style of bowl as the preceding 
English pipes, though in the latter the flat heel Is observed instead of 

the spur. Upon the heel of this pipe are 
stamped Ave dots in a ring around a ciMitral 
dot. This variety is commonly described as 
one of the earliest English forms. Some 
attribute them even to the Elizabethan 
period. 

This stamp has been called by some 
writers a lily; by others it is described as 
a rose. So far, however, as the writer has 
been able to determine, it is extremely diffi- 
cult to ascribe to these pipes any certain 
date, and there is doubt even whether the 
shape is not common alilie to France, 
England, and Holland. 
The trade marks and symbols on trade-pipe heels and bowls are too 
numerous to mention, though doubtless a study made of them would 
settle many vexed points in 
American archteology. 

There is in the Douglass col- 
lection a pipe presented by Dr. 
Ferdinand Kellar, of Switzer- 
land, and by him attributed to 
the sixteenth century, upon the 
side of the bowl of which are the 
same five dots in a circle re- 
ferred to as being on the heel of 
the English pipe, and called a 

rose and also a lily, though the form of the pipe is more like those 
which in this paper are described as Iroquoian, the shape of which was 

mainly due to French 
influences. Upon one 
of the English pi])es in 
the U. S. National Mu- 
seum collection there 
appears the monogram 
IB on the heel. 

Fig. 77 is quite an 
ancient English trade 
pipe, found in an Indian 
grave at Burs Hill, War- 
ren, Ehode Island, and collected by Mr. J. H. Clark, upon which there 
is neither heel nor spur, though the mill mark around the outer side of 
the bowl is quite distinct. The texture of the pottery from which it is

made is mncli less hard tliau is usually tlie case with trade pipes, and 
it having no heel or spur n)ay indicate that it was of a more primitive 
form than those having such. 

Fig. 78 is a pipe in every way similar to the Rhode Island specimen, 
made, however, from dark green chlorite and well polished. It was 
given the writer some years since, and was said to be a surface find 
from near jS^orfolk, Virginia. The 
bowl and stem are as thin as are usu- 
ally those of the molded trade type 
of burned clay, and it is a fine exam- 
ple of skill in stone work as well as 
an evidence of contemporaneous use 
of stone and clay pipes of similar form. 
Even though it were demonstrated 
that this i)ipe was made with steel 
tools, as it probablj' was, it would rep- 
resent a piece of exceptionally good 
workmanship for a modern mechanic. 
A cast of a stone pipe (fig. 79) 
found at ISTacoochee, Georgia, collected by Mr. J. H. Nichols, is clearly 
of the tyi3e of the trade pipe. Its short stem and slightly enlarged 
mouthpiece, as well as the thinness of the bowl, would, however, ap- 
pear to indicate a metal prototype and probable European origin. 

Fig. 80 represents a cast of an extremely 
peculiar and unique specimen of the primi- 
tive trade pipe form, surrounded by a disk 
of stone evidently so carved and worked out 
of the stone as to resemble sewed leather. 
It is from Tioga County, New York, col- 
lected by Mr. J. Allen. While the dots en- 
circling the pipe, representing the stitches 
of the needle, are upon the one side in two 
rows, there is but a single row on the oppo- 
site side; all are, however, connected by 
lines running from dot to dot, as though 
intended to indicate the thread. The pipe 
form and disk appear to suggest that it is 
made in imitation of a pipe in its leather 
case. 
The next pipe (fig. 81), which also evi- 
dently belongs to the European type, is made from blue clay, and 
is said to be of the primitive Italian form. The bowl, at right 
angles to the stem, is very much larger than are any of the Euro- 
pean pipes with which the writer is acquainted. It was found at 
Kedbank, New Jersey, and collected by Mr. W. S. Vaux. Tlie 
bowl rests upon three coils as a base, rudely ornamental, parallel

liuesruuiiiug closely up and down the same, beginning at the top of the 
coil and ending just below the upper edge of the rim. Pritchett, in Ye 
Smokiana, represents such a pipe as of Roman make of the date of 1669. 
Judging from the large size of this bowl, the type would probably be of 
a i)eriod when the price of tobacco was cheap, as was the case during 

the reign of Charles II. Pritchett 
appears to have copied his illustra- 
tion from one of Benedetto Stella, 
which was published in Rome in 1669, 
and is by the latter referred to as of 
English make. 

As early as 1670 the Colony of 
Virginia shipped 12,000 hogsheads 
of tobacco, which was equal to 
12,000,000 pounds. 

Fig. 82 is a modern Dutch pipe 
made of the usual white clay, such as 
the ordinary clay pipe is commonly 
made from. It is figured solely for 
the puri^ose of illustrating the survival of ])rimitive forms. The orna- 
mentation is indicative of a close relationship to a class of in^es from 
Georgia herein referred to, and from this and other known si)ecimens 
the deduction is quite natural that Europern traders in pipes usually 
catered in type and ornamentation to prevailing Indian toims, the orna- 
mentation, with few exceptions, being due to European ideas. Pipes of 
this type were evidently intended to be smoked with hollow stems, 
probably made of reed. If the leaves sur- 
rounding the stem and radiating from the 
bird's beak and the beak itself are com- 
pared with those upon the pipes from the 
Etowah mound, and the mound pipes from 
Georgia, it will be admitted that they have 
a common origin, whether that be Dutch or 
Indian, and the mold mark on the Etowah 
specimen (fig. 238) suggests that it is Euro- 
pean. Ornamentation very similar to the 
bird's beak appears to be employed in cer-

than Dutch or English iuflueuces. It may be argued that this resem- 
blance between the pipes of the South and the North is due to acci- 
dent rather than design, though tlie writer is convinced tliat in this 
case, as in most others of American pipes where artistic figures in the 
round are observed, the idea is European and due to European 
influences entirely. 

The -'■trade pipe" goes by many names in different parts of the British 
possessions in Europe, "Danes pipes," "Cromwell pipes," "Elfin 
pipes," and "Celtic pipes" being among the most common. Wilsou 
says that the pipes known by the last two names have been found in 
considerable numbers in North Berwick and elsewhere in Scotland.^ 

This pipe is quite common in many parts of Scotland. Some 
arch.eologists still contend tuat pipes of this type antedate the reign 
of Elizabeth, if not the discovery of America itself, a view in support 
of which there appears but little evidence. 

One of the best known trade pipes was a London pipe which got its 
name from the "Old Cock Tavern." A rooster stamped on the heel 
identities it. 

The writer possesses a pipe of this type found in a shell heap on the 
shore of (Chesapeake Bay, which has been so scraped over its entire 
surface so as to obliterate the mold mark. The attempt has been suc- 
cessful, except at one point on the heel, where a trace of it may still be 
seen. The stem of this specimen is only about 2 inches long and near 
the end is worn through on top by the smoker's teeth, which, if done by 
an Indian, must have been late in the seventeenth or early in the 
eighteenth century, for among primitive pipes there is seldom any evi- 
dence of the stem coming in contact with the teeth, and so marked is 
this that one is impressed with the belief that it must be due to some 
especial custom in connection with the pipe. A noticeable feature of 
this pipe is that the stem has been broken off close to the bowl and 
repaired with glue. This pipe was purchased of a lad who was smok- 
ing it at the time, and stated that he had found it less than half an 
hour before. As it was of undoubted trade form and tlie boy attached 
no value to it, there appears no reason to doubt the correctness of the 
story. That the pipe may, however, be that of a white man, as the wear 
of the stem would appear to indicate, must be admitted as a possibility, 
for Jewitt refers to "the bowls of many of the older pipes " which "are 
scraped into form after being molded."^ 

We can only surmise wliat the glue is with which this pipe has been 
repaired, as the only reference the writer recalls of aboriginal glue 
occurs in Smith's account of Virginia, in which he remarks that " with 
sinews and the tops of deers' horns boiled to a jelly they make a glue 
that will not dissolve in cold water.'"

458 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

Whether the original trade pipe is a copy of an earlier stone i>ipe or 
not may be open to question, the writer being of the impression that it 
is a mo<lificatioii of the primitive tube. Mr. Newton D. Sprecher, how- 
ever, found on the Upper Potomac River, near Shejiherdstown, iu Vir- 
ginia, a very perfect specimen of a stone pipe of the " trade type," the 
stem of which is somewliat large in proportiou to the size of the bowl. 
It appears to be made of banded slate. 

While the Indian, we are told, would give anything in his possession 
for tobacco, and made many aud sometimes singular uses of it, it 
remained for the whites to adopt it as currency. The first evidence of 
which that has come under the writer's notice is an enactment at James 
City, Virginia, in 1619, declaring tobacco a currency, the treasurer of 
the colony being directed to receive it at a valuation of 3 shilliugs a 
pound for the best and 18 pence a pound for the second quality.' 

Governor Yeardley directed general attention to the culture of 
tobacco, the profits of which became so alluring that all other occupa- 
tions were forsaken for it. In the colony of Virginia, with a population 
of 4,000 iu 1620, 40 hogsheads of tobacco were shipped to Englaud; in 
1638, 500,000 pounds, and in 1670 it had increased to 12,000,000 pounds.^ 

During the reign of Elizabeth there was no especial reason for a 
small bowl to the pipe, except the natural scarcity of the tobacco sup- 
ply, the duty on it being only 2 peuce a pound. James I, however, 
raised it to the enormous sum of Oi shilliugs a pound.' 

From this time on for a long period the strongest efforts were made to 
suppress the use of tobacco. The same year (1620) that the colony of Vir- 
ginia exported 40 hogsheads of tobacco King James I issued a procla- 
mation for restraint of disorderl}'^ trading of tobacco. "Whereas," says 
the statute, "We, etc., out of the dislike we had to the use of tobacco, 
tending to a general and new cnrrur)tion, both of men's bodies and man- 
ners, and yet, nevertheless, holding it of the two more tolerable that 
the same should be imported, amongst many other vanities and super- 
fluities which came from beyond the seas, then permitted to be planted 
here within this realm, thereby to abuse aud misemploy the soil of this 
fruitful Kingdom " * * * did prohibit, after the 2d day of Febru- 
ary, (then) next "the sowing, setting, or plautiug of tobacco; and 
whereas we have taken into consideration the great waste and consump- 
tion of the wealth of our Kingdoms by the inordinate liberty and abus<> 
of tobacco, being a weed of no necessary use, and but of late years 
brought into our dominions," ^ it prohibits others than such as shall be 
authorized and appointed thereto by letters patent from having it in 
possession, etc.

AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 459 

Charles I, iu 1G25, issued a proclamation " De herba nicotiana," in 
which the following appears: "Whereas our most dear father did, 29th 
September last and the 2d of March last, publish two proclamations 
prohibiting- the importation of tobacco not the growth of Virginia or 
the Sommer Islands," gives until the ''fowerth daye" of May next to 
export any such as may be in the country.' 

So drastic a measure as to require the exportation from England of 
tobacco not grown in the British possessions appears to have been the 
cause, in some way, of a proclamation issued the following year (1G26) 
allowing the importation into England of 50,000 pounds of Spanish or 
foreign tobacco. '^ 

When the demand for tobacco exceeded the supply, the natural law 
of trade immediately became in force, and the jirice increased in pro- 
portion. At one i)eriod it was related that the newest and least worn 
shillings were laid aside with which to pur- 
chase an equal weight of the Herba nicotiana. 

In 1626, it is said, " Sir Henry Oglander, in 
the Isle of Wight, records for eight ounces of 
tobacco 5 shillings," and in the Journal of 
Kev. Giles Moore, in 1656, he notes "for two 
ounces of tobacco 1 shilling." ^ This enormous 
cost of tobacco would naturally have a ten- 
dency to reduce the pipe bowl to "eltin" 
dimensions. p^^ g3

some colonial writings we can but infer that 

they indulged in smoking to a less extent than Englishmen did at home. 
The restrictive legislation of the mother country. against smoking was 
also enacted in some of the colonies, and the writer is of the impression 
that the law against smoking in the public streets yet prevails upon 
the statute books, applying to Boston, Massachusetts, and survives 
from the laws of the seventeenth century. The tobacco pipe of the 
famous Miles Standish, who came over in the Mayflower, and which was 
smoked by him on the day of his death, is referred to as a little iron 
affair about the size and shape of a common clay pipe,^ probably just 
such an iron pipe as is often found in European countries and com- 
monly, but erroneously, the writer thinks, attributed to the Roman 
period.

460 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

County, North Carolina, collected by Gen. Thomas A. Duncan, is said 
to have been found in an old shaft supposed to have been one of the 
workings of De Soto in that State. The cone-shaped bowl is at right 
angles to its tubular stem, both bowl and stem being made of sheet 
wrought iron cut to the desired size, the edges of which when brought 
together have been neatly brazed, the brass line being well shown in 
the illustration. The writer would suspect a much more recent period 
than that of De Soto as the date of this pipe, and either French or 
English as its origin, probably the latter. 

This view is greatly strenghtened by fig. 84, a steatite pipe from 
Westerly, Rhode Island, collected by Mr. J. H. Clark. The bowls of 
these two pipes, except in material, are identical, and the stone speci- 
men leaves little doubt of its being a copy of a metal original. The 
walls of bowl and stem are approximately three-sixteenths of an inch 
thick, a glance at which suggests a metal rather than clay prototype. 
A still more primitive metal pipe than any we 
have encountered is a specimen catalogued as from 
"Virginia," in the museum of the University of 
Pennsylvania, which is about 8 inches long, made 
from a thin sheet of copper, in shape somewhat like 
that of the trade pipe. The copper had first been 
cut to suit the purpose foi which it was intended; 
the stem has been formed by hammering the edges 
into tubular shape and then made to overlap; the

jjrojecting around the upper edge of the bowl, ham- 
mered from the inside. The metal from which this pipe is made is 
neither welded, brazed, nor riveted, yet the overla])ping metal forms a 
most satisfactory stem and bowl. 

Still another metal pipe made of sheet copper was plowed up in a 
field at Mount Eaton, Stark County, Ohio, and is in the Douglass col- 
lection. It is of thin sheet, the bowl and stem both being brazed. 

From the period of the first use of tobacco in Euroi)e, so far as the 
writer has observed, the shape of the trade pipe has remained practi- 
cally constant, the European having apparently adoi^ted a pipe of a 
shape selected by the early traders with the Indians. 

Among the American Indians there are known to have been many 
different plants smoked in pipes; and while the European appears to 
have been generally consistent in his employment of tobacco there 
were exceptions to the rule, a most peculiar one of which was that 
recorded of William Bredon, who in 1G33 was the parson or vicar of 
Thornton, "who was so given to tobacco and drink that when he had 
no tobacco he would cut the bell ropes and smoke them."'

AMERICAN AHORIGTNAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 461 

The English were trading in axes, blue vAoth and peake, Jew's-harps, 
pipes, etc., according to the records of proceedings in the Council of 
Maryland in 1637, and had, presumably, done so in Virginia from an 
i'arlier period. Among articles seized under a sheriff's levy on the 
goods of Captain Cleyborne, June 20, 1638, are enumerated, "two 
trading pipes." Josselyn asserts that tobacco derives its name from 
Tabago, one of the "Caribbe Islands," and refers to its proper name as 
'•picielte, as others will Petum; nicotian from Nicot, a Portugal," and 
quaintly refers to its being "made the complement of our entertain- 
ments and hath made more slaves than Mahomet."' 

After the middle of the seventeenth century the English (constantly 
refer to the pipe in trade with the Indians and in the presents given 
in treaties and councils. At first they are enumerated in small (luan- 
tities, but soon are treated of by the gross. The colonists cultivated 
the tobacco plant, and early turned out by machinery pipes in which 
to smoke it, all which added to their trade and its consequent profits. 

Among the articles enumerated which were given in exchange for 
land lying between Kankokas Creek and Timber Creek in New Jersey, 
on September 10, 1677, are 120 pipes and 100 jew's-harps.^ 

Five years later William Penn landed and received the lighted calu- 
met or pipe, "which was smoked out of by all, the great sachem first 
taking a whiff, then William Penn, and subsequently the sachems and 
vvarriors and squaws of every tribe." ' A second smoke closed the bar- 
gain for the purchase of the land; and 300 tobacco pipes, 100 hands of 
tobacco, 20 tobacco boxes, and 100 jew's-harps were a portion of the 
articles given in the exchange. 

Garcillasso de la Vega, in his lioyal Commentaries of Peru, 1688, 
gives so little information concerning tobacco beyond mentioning its 
name, " sayri," as to leave one under the impression that it was not 
smoked by the natives; it was, however, used as snuff". 

In the "Counterblaste" of King James I, tobacco is spoken of as 
"loathsome to the eye, hurtful to the nose, harmful to the brain, dan- 
gerous to the lungs, and in the black stinking fume thereof nearest 
resembling the horrible stygian smoke of the pit that is bottomless."* 

English pipes presented to the Indians in 1692 were of wood and 
tin, others were referred to as " wampum pipes," and others as of 
"white clay."''

and 'Dionoudades'" (Wyandots and iS^ation de Petun), among the 
presents to the Indians "one hundred and ten wampum pipes''' are 
mentioned, referring i)robably to the hard-burned trade pipes. 

Labat, in 1724, says tobacco was like an apple of discord which 
hghted up a lively war among the learned, in the discussions concern- 
ing which the ignorant took an equal part; even the women were not 
backward in arraying themselves for or against a thing they under- 
stood no more than they did the serious problems of their times. Doc 
tors, he says, took advaiitage of the occasion, though they had never 
before seen or heard of tobacco, and did not hesitate to discuss its vir- 
tues as though they had known it since the time of Galen, Hippocrates, 
and Esculapius. lieasoning without knowledge, they seldom agreed; 
some tempered it with cooling drugs, others mixed it with aromatic 
herbs, but all concurred in prescribing it with directions how to pre- 
pare and take it according to age, strength, and temperament. They 
prescribed the exact quantity to be taken, and at what time; one was to 
take it fasting and another only after a meal; one in the evening and 
the other in the morning, etc.^ 

The natives of the Hudson Bay country received from the English 
traders "medicines" analogous to the tobacco of America, according to 
Ellis, in 1750, who says: "There are many, especially those living on 
the cliffs of the Great Lakes in the interior of the country, who act the 
role of charlatans, with drugs they buy of the English — sugar, ginger, 
barlej?^, pepper, the seeds of kitchen plants, Spanish liquorice, pow- 
dered tobacco, etc. The Indians take all these drugs in small quan- 
tities, either as remedies, or that they may excel in hunting, fishing, 
or in fighting; qualities attributed to these trifles by the Hudson Bay 
English. It is by these means that a third of the trade is made with 
these charlatans who exchange them for furs which the common people 
give them or which they trap.''^ De Paw says: " Sarmiento in going 
for reenforcements for his settlements was made prisoner by this cele- 
brated Kaleigh, who on his part had sought El Dorado, and who was 
afterwards beheaded at London for having taught the English to 
smoke, at least the judges alleged this pretext to immolate a great 
man whom they disliked. If it is true that England gains annually 
twenty millions from this American plant it is surprising that Ealeigh 
has not yet a statue."^ 

At Damariscotta River, Moscougas Sound, Maine, Mr. Phelps has 
repeatedly found iron imi)lements and clay pipes of European make in 
the upper layers of the great shell heap, but in no case have these things 
been found below 1 foot from the surface.^

AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 463 

There is in the collection of the IJ. S. National Museum (Cat. No. 6182) 
afrag:ment of a pipe made of blue clay which was found at Bloomfield, 
Onondaga County, New York, collected by Col. E. Jewett. It is poorly 
burned, yet quite artistic in design, the attempt having apparently 
been made to imitate an ear of corn on the panels surrounding the 
bowl. That its origin is due to the white i)eople is further shown by a 
stamp of a notched arrow fitted into the string of a bow, which is 
drawn back to its head, this is placed inside a diamond-shai)ed figure. 
The specimen apparently belonged to a pipe of the type of the Konmn 
specimen found at Ked Bank, New Jerse3^ The Kev. W. M. Beau- 
champ refers in a private letter to a pewter pipe found in Oneida 
County, New York, of the "trade pipe" form, and speaks of others of 
brass and iron. Dr. E. A. Barber also refers to a pipe of the "trade 
pipe" pattern which was found in the Jura Mountains, Canton of Berne, 
Switzerland, made of iron, having upon its bowl the face of a man 
facing the smoker, and a second face on the far side facing in the 
opposite direction, and a second specimen, on the bowl of which there 
is represented the leaf of some plant, probably a tobacco leaf. 

In a communication to the Daily Post of Birmingham, England, by 
Mr. Este, he refers to "pipes of Sevres, of Saxe, and Berlin; Capo di 
Monte and Furstenburg, Copenhagen; English pottery, Worcester 
glazed pipes of Bromptou ware and Wedgewood ; Italian pipes of deli- 
cate ivory and choicest Venetian glass; German pipes of agate and 
meerschaum; Swedish pipes of iron from Danemora, and Eoman pipes 
from the Campagna," as among the celebrated pii)es of the world.' 

These and those of many other countries were among the pipes in 
the wonderful Bragge collection now in the British Museum. On the 
Indian town sites of the Colonial period fragments of many of these 
])ipes at times occur, especially those of the Spanish, French, Dutch, 
P^nglish, and Italian types. Among the French pipes of the beginning 
of this century Fairholt figures one, part of the stem of which consists 
of a cannon having upon the barrel two bowls, one behind the other, in 
shape of bombshells. The idea is identical with the double-bowled 
Siouan callinite pipe herein figured- (fig. 176). 

A similar specimen has been found in a mound in Michigan. There 
are doubtless those who will consider the latter type purely aboriginal, 
though the writer can not help thinking that the form is due to the 
infiuence of European art. The same may be said of the death's-head 
])ipe, not uncommon on the continent of Europe, which has characteris- 
tics similar to those of certain pipes of the Iroquoian type found along 
the St. Lawrence, in northern New Y'ork. An inquiry among distin- 
guished archipologists of France, Italy, and Holland as to the primitive 
forms of pipes of those countries has had only negative results. An- 
cient stone pipes ai:)pear scarcely ever in Europe, the only one coming 
under the wi-iter's notice being referred to by Wilson as coming from

the village of Morniiigside, at the base of the Peutland Hills, in Scot- 
land, wliere numerous traces of primitive population Lave been brought 
to light.' 

Dr. E. A. Barber refers to a pipe of Etruscan origin, having a beau- 
tiful patina, in the Campagna collection, which presents some charac- 
teristics of originality, yet Eev. W. M. Beauchanip refers to a specimen 
of quite similar type in his collection at Tompkinsville, New York 
which was found on the shore of the Susquehanna River. 

It is to be regretted that the history of the tomahawk pipe is so 
incomplete in early American writings, for it certainly has occupied as 
important a place, both in war and peace, over a great part of the con- 
tinent as any pii)e known, and is peculiarly a war pipe and one of the 
most familiar and terrible weapons of the allies of the whites in the 
endless colonial wars of America. According to Strachey the native 
term for "hatchet" was "taccahacan," or "tamahaac',"as distinguished 
from an Indian hatchet, which was "cunsenagwas."^ 

This word eventually came to designate the "war hatchet" of the 
Indian, supplied by the military commanders of the whole continent in 
equipping the warriors on the many expeditions in which French and 
English were constantly engaged, and was furnished the Indian allies 
of the English in our war of Independence. This weapon was either in 
the form of a spear or hatchet blade on one side, while upon the oppo- 
site side there was a cup-like cavity with a small hole extending into 
the eye of the weapon into which a tough handle of wood was fitted, 
18 inches or 2 feet in length. The handle was perforated almost its 
entire length, and below the hollow of the bowl it was bored at right 
angles to this perforation, a suitable stem hole for the passage of the 
tobacco smoke when the implement was in use as a pipe. The toma- 
hawk pipe was not only attractive and popular in trade, but, like the 
earlier trade pipe, was given as a present at councils and ratifications 
of treaties; it was a pipe, a hatchet, and a mace or hammer all in one, 
and answered an important military requirement in lessening the 
weight and incumbrances of the warrior, who otherwise would have 
tenaciously held to the stone pipe, which, in itself, was heavier than the 
tomahawk. French, English, and Spanish all appear to have made 
and distributed the metal tomahawk. Usually it was of iron, but 
examjiles are known of copper, of brass, and of pewter. Some were 
made of a combination of brass and iron, intended for ornamenta- 
tion rather than to add to its eifectiveness. At times the blades were 
inlaid with silver in ornamental designs. The outline <»f the bladed 
tomahawk of metal is so similar to the stone hammer-ax or Thor- 
hammer of antiquity as to suggest that the one was copied from the 
other. The handles of these tomahawks were from an inch to 1^ 
inches in diameter, the stems of them when not bored were split open,

and, having a groove gouged in each piece, they would be again phiced 
together and held in place with glue, or bound with wire or hide. The 
ornamentation of i)ipe stems depended largely upon the owner's taste, 
they being decorated in the most attractive manner; sometimes the 
ornamentation would be of feathers, of strips of skins of various 
animals, or they would be studded with brass or 
silver nails, and scores or tallies were often kept 
by notches, representing the enemies killed or 
struck with the weapon. The writer recalls a Creek 
tomahawk hatchet pipe upon the handle of which 
were several groups of score marks said to repre- 
sent the victims of its owner's prowess, the ditfer- 
ent scores indicating distinct tribes with which 
the owner had fought. 

Fig. 85 is one of the most grace- 
ful and at the same time most sym- 
metrical of the familiar forms of 
the English tomahawk pipes. Its 
long graceful hatchet blade is made 
of iron, into the blade of which is 
inlaid an ornamented silver plate in 
the form of the now familiar Bowie 
knife, upon the blade of which is 
neatly engraved ^'H. Knox,*' as 
though a play upon words were in- 
tended. The handle of this pipe- 
hatchet has wound around it a 
band of silver, and a number of sil- 
ver nails driven into the wood. 
This tomahawk is 8 inches from edge of the blade to 
the top of its bowl. There is in the U. S. Kational Mu- 
seum collection a similarly shaped specimen from Cat- 
taraugus County, New York, with a blade of brass into 
which is brazed a steel cutting-edge. On these toma- 
hawks the bowls are similar, shaped like an inverted 
acorn, having the general characteristics of the Micmac 
stone pipe. There is in the collection of the IT. S. Na- 
tional Museum another tomahawk-shaped pipe of wood, 
of Cherokee make, the bowl and eye of which are, how- 
ever, reenforced by a lining of sheet iron. The earliest 
description the writer has found to tomahawks is that of ilobert Kogers, 
who, in 1765, says: "This weapon," the tomahawk, "is formed much like 
an hatchet, having a long stem or handle; the head is a round ball of 
solid wood, well enough calculated to knock men's brains out, which on 
the other side of the stem terminates in a point where the edge would be 
if made an hatchet, which point is set a little hooking or coming towards

many forms, according to the o(;casion and end for which it is used, and 
on it they keep journals of their marches and most important and noted 
occurrences in a kind of hieroglyphs."' 

The description of Kogers would therefore indicate that the tonui- 
hawk pipe was not in general use ten years prior to the Revolution but 
about contemporaneous with the war of the Revo- 
lution. 

Fig. 86, from Minniwaukan or Devils Lake, Dakota, 
collected by Maj. Paul Beckwith, United States Indian 
Agent, presents the tomahawk pipe with the spear- 
shaped blade. The ornamentation of this blade is quite 
gracefully arranged by incisions in the metal in conven- 
tional star and crescent-like figures and notches on the 
upper angles of the spear and around the edges of the 
eye. The bowl, while longer, is less ornamental than 
that of the preceding figure. This type is commonly 
attributed to the French, but with little apparent au- 
thority, though the presumption may well be correct, 
for we know that pipes, from their shape and ornamen- 
tation, were attributable to their proper tribe, and it is 
most natural that English and French should have 
armed their allies in such a manner as to render them 
easily distinguishable from their enemies. Had the 
tomahawk pipe been employed in Rogers's time he 
would scarcely have failed to notice-it, one would think, 
though. Col. A. Lane Fox, quoted by Stevens, says, that 
"during the American war the English were compelled 
to make iron tomahawks after the native pattern with 
a pipe bowl opposite the blade of the weapon, before 
the Indians could be efficiently armed as allies."^ This would probably 
identify sufficiently the time when these weapons came into general use 
as about the beginning of the Revolution. They have been referred 
to as instruments "resembling a little axe with which the Indians crush 
the heads of their enemies, which they smoke, and on the handle of which 
they keep a register of their victories." ^ 

Closely allied to the last specimen is one (fig. 87) collected among the 
Kiowa by Mr. James Mooney. Though the head is only 6f inches long,

the handle of it is 20 inches lonji". Mr. Mooney, who has passed much time 
among' the natives of the Southwestern portion of the United States, 
attributes this specimen to the Mexican or Spanish type; a somewhat 
similar specimen (Cat.Xo.83()3,U.S.X.M.),collected among the Apaches, 
would appear to sustain this opinion, the pipe tigured retaining- very 
greatly the pike or halberd shape which was in use in the eighteenth 
century. 

The form of the old metal battle axe is preserved in fig. 88, which is 
an iron tomahawk, found in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, by Mr. 
W. K. Stewart. The axe is 7 inches long, its blade being perforated 
with three holes for the purj^ose of allowing the attachment of cloth 
or feather ornaments; brass disks, 
slightly convex, are brazed to the blade 
to heighten the eftect from an esthetic 
point of view. This curved blade may 
be seen in many weajwus in the collec- 
tion of the U. S. National Museum re- 
cently brought from the Kongo, as 
well as in the battle-axe of the time of 
the Crusades. 

There is in the collection of the Mu- 
seum of the University of Pennsyl- 
vania an excellent bronze tomahawk 
pipe from Pasadena, California, the ex- 
terior of which, blade, bowl, and eye, 
are all covered with series of short 
straight and curved lines arranged in 
tasteful designs. 

In the Siouan area, near the waters 
of the Upper Missouri, tomahawks in 
imitation of those made of metal are 
found made of catlinite. 

Pil^es of this character, owing to the 
Indians' being moved on to reserva- 
tions from their original homes, are 
liable to be found far from their original point of distribution, and while 
the same argument would apply to pipes of other shapes it would be to 
a far less extent for many reasons, chief of which would be that the 
earlier Indians were confined within more restricted limits. 

There was, there can be little doubt, a more intimate acquaintance of 
the whites with the interior of the continent, through the wanderings of 
hunters and traders, than is generally believed. That the goods of the 
whites were traded from tribe to tribe before the whites themselves 
penetrated the country is recorded. James McBride, according to 
Filson, was the first white man who had knowledge of Kentucky, 
and, in 1754, "accompanied by some friends, descended the Ohio in

canoes, disembarked at the mouth of the Kentucky, aud marked three

Du Pratz, however, it should be remembered, in 1758, only four years 
subsequent to this supposed visit, published a map of parts of the 
interior of the continent, upon which the Miami and the Maumee, the 
latter under the name of the Riviere du Portage, are both laid down.^ 

It is known that not only did the individual trader or trapper try to 
keep his rivals in ignorance of the territories which he visited, but the 
matter was an international one as well, for Spanish, French, English, 
aud Dutch each tried to deceive those of other nationalities concerning 
the interior or back country, the struggle then, as in some countries 
even now, being to obtain or retain exclusive trade privileges. We see 
the same struggle to-day in Africa between the French and English 
which two hundred years ago was carried on in America. 

In 1778 Daniel Boone was taken prisoner by 200 Indians and two 
Frenchmen, who carried him to the salt mines, where he found 27 more 
of his party, whom he regularly surrendered. " The advantageous con- 
ditions of his surrender," he says, "they observed strictly."^ 

MONITOR PIPES. 

There is no pipe more striking or better marked in its characteristics 
than the "Monitor," which is widely distributed in the eastern United 
States, it being often found in mounds and other jirimitive burial 
l)laces. This pipe is constantly encountered and has upon its surftice 
the distinct striie of the steel tools with which it was made, leaving 
little doubt that it was a common form after the advent of the whites. 
The delicacy of its finish as well as of its outline is surpassed by no 
American pipe, though this type does not appear to be found having 
ui)on it rei)resentations of animal life in any form, rarely ornamenta- 
tion of any sort. The material from which they were usually, though 
not invariably, made is a chlorite or steatite and sometimes serpentine, 
though rarely the latter, and specimens having certain of the charac- 
teristics of this type are known which are made of pottery. They vary 
in color from nearly white to jet black, being usually highly polished 
and have remarkably thin bowls. 

Adair, in 1775, refers possibly to a pipe of this character. He says: 
''The Indians make beautiful stone pipes, and the Cherokees the best 
of any of the Indians, for their mountainous country contains many 
sorts and colors of soil proper for such uses. They easily form them 
with their tomahawks, and afterwards finish them in any desired form 
with their knives; the pipes being of a v(;ry soft quality until they are 
smoked with and used to the fire when they become quite hard. They

are often fully a span long, and the bowls are about lialf as large again 
as our English pipes. -The fore part of each commonly runs out with 
a peak two or three fingers broad and a quarter of an incli thick on 
both sides of the bowl; lengthwise they cut several pictures with a 
great deal of skill and labor, such as a buffalo and a panther on op])o- 
site sides of the bowl, a rabbit and a fox. The savages work so slow 
that one of their artists is two months at a pipe with his knife before 
he finishes it; indeed, as before observed, they are great enemies of 
profuse sweating and are never in a hurry about a good thing. The 
stems are commonly made of soft wood, about 2 feet long and an inch 
thick, cut into four squares each, scooped till they join very near the 
hollow of the stem ; the beaux always hollow the squares except a little 
at each corner to hold them together, to which they fasten a parcel of 
bell buttons, different sorts of flue feathers, and several small battered 
pieces of copper kettles, hammered, round deerskin thongs, and a red 
painted scalp. They so accurately paint hieroglyphic characters on the 
stem that all the war actions and the 
tribe of the owner and a great many 
circumstances of things are fully de- 
lineated." ' 

The monitor pi j>e is one upon which 
more care has been expended in bor- 
ing its bowl and stem and in grinding 
and polishing the surface than any 
other type of pipe on the continent, 
not excepting the famous mound 
pipes. They vary in length from 3 
to 18 inches with bases from 1 to 4 inches wide, the bowls varying from 
1 to S inches in depth with a diameter of from three-fourths of an inch 
to If inches, usually cylindrical, though at times distinctly elliptical; 
they appear to have been smoked without separate stem. The stem 
holes seldom exceed one-eighth of an inch in diameter and are bored with 
remarkable accuracy, the variation of the size of the stem hole from 
end to end being scarcely appreciable. This remarkable accuracy of 
boring in stone where the walls of the tubes and bowls are commonly 
not in excess of one-eighth of an inch thick is almost proof positive that 
the drilling was done with steel tools. 

The most primitive specimen of the monitor type (fig. 89) is from Mil- 
ford, Massachusetts, collected by Mr. J. H. Olark. It has a bowl of 
oblong cross section, at the base of which is a slight heel, suggestive of 
the primitive European pipe; the cross section of the stem is a flattened 
ellipsoid, but slightly out of the plane of the bowl. This bowl is rudely 
scratched, as is the stem, the stride crossing and recrossing over the

whole surface. Stems of this type usually project beyond the bowl and 
broadeu out on each side of it to a greater or less distance. The out- 
line of these pipes is at times strikingly similar to the form of the moni- 
tor vessel of the civil war. On the upper side of the stem of a pipe of 
this character in the collection of the U. S. National Museum from Ches- 
ter County, South Carolina, occurs three straight lines cut through the

surface in the form of a parallelogram open on the side next the mouth- 
piece. A pipe of this type was also found on York Eiver, Virginia, 
and is in the collection of Col. William H. Love, of Baltimore, Mary- 
land. 

A very similar specimen about 7 inches long, but without the heel, is 
here given, after Mr. Gerard Fowke (fig. 00), collected by Maj. J. W. 
Powell in Sullivan County, Tennessee. It was found in a burial 
mound and is of black chlorite. It has an alate stem, 
so common in pipes of this character. The largest 
specimen of this type so far encountered is probably 
a "Great pipe," having a bowl 8 inches long, being 
upward of 17 inches in total length, which was found 
in a mound in Marion County, Kentucky, collected 
by Mr. William T. Knott. This pipe is finished so 

delicately and carefully 
that over its whole sur- 
face there does not re- 
main a single mark from 
the tools with which it 
was made. The smooth- 
ness of the surface is such 
and thebowl and stem are 
so thin that it would require unusual care to duplicate it with any tools 
with which it may have been made. In pipes of this type there is 
almost invariably a pronounced ridge running the length of the center 
of the stem, and so marked is this as to suggest a ductile prototype, 
either of pottery or metal.

Mr. J. P. Eogau. It is of clilorite, and lias an extreme length of 5 
inches, with a width of stem of 1.;^ inches. The flaring top, .nid the 
bowl, which approaches the rectaiignlar, indicate no other than most 
primitive tools in working the surface, though even here there can be 
little doubt that metal was em])loyed in boring both the bowl and the 
stem. The tiaring top commonly noticeable in pipes of this type does 
not appear to have reached its limit except in those specimens where 
bowl and stem are at right angles 
to each other. 

A very dark, almost black, 
" monitor " (fig. 92) is from Cum- 
berland County, Tennessee, col 
lected by Mr. S. D. Hoskins. It 
has a Hat base 3 inches wide, 
though its height is little over 2i 
inches. The stem at its thickest 
is slightly more than one-fourth 
of an inch, while the barrel- 
shaped bowl, with its wide and 
thin flaring top, have all been 
highly polished. The bowl cavity has been enlarged by gouging. 

Professor Haldeman possesses a somewhat similar specimen, though 
without the enlargement of the rim of the bowl, from York County, 
Pennsylvania, which is well polished and made from a green stone. 

A brownish steatite from Michigan, collected by Mr. D. S. Carviu, 
in shape almost identical with the last specimen (fig. 93), was found 
in a mound in Kanawha County, West Virginia, with a number of 

copper bracelets and objects of stone. 
Under the flaring top of this speci- 
men are the tile marks, too distinct 
to leave any doubt that it was with 
such a tool that they were made. 
They radiate from the inner to the 
outer rim, in series of parallel 
straight lines, and are equally dis- 
tinct at the base of the bowl. 

The most pronounced and typical 
" monitor " pipe is fig. 94, from Knox 
County, Tennessee, collected by Mr. 
J. W. Emmert. The projection of the base is as pronounced in front of 
the bowl as it is at the stem end. The barrel shape of this bowl has 
great similarity to certain of the urn-shaped bowl pipes. In this, as in 
the last specimen, the file marks are observed at the exterior base of the 
bowl where it joins the stem. They also appear under the flaring top of 
the bowl with great distinctness. Tliis pipe is made of a light gray chlo- 
rite, and is, as a mechanical production, quite a marvelous piece of work.

It was collected by 
Mr. J. W. Norris, and 
is 5 inches long, with 
a greatest width of 
base of 1^ inches, and 
on this pipe again are 
seen the iile marks at 
one x)oint, under the 
flaring top of the bowl, 
though they are not so . 
pronounced as they 
are on many other 
specimens. 

A pipe having a stem ' 
peculiarly of this type, 
as well as a bowl of the monitor shape, is fig. 9G, from Loudon County, 
Tennessee. It has no flat prow extending in front of the bowl, but 
there is at its base, on the 
side toward the smoker, a 
triangular depression, cut in 
intaglio and polished, that 
is convincing that the spec- 
imen was made by a person 
familiar with a metal pipe 
of similar shape, and if any- 
thing were necessary to 
strengthen this belief it is 
presented in the gracefully 
curved u^iper rim of the 

bowl. The file marks on this specimen again leave 
no doubt of European contact with the persons who 
used them. There is yet another pipe in the TJ. S. Na- 
tional Museum collection (Cat. I^o. 135081) from Knox

A light gray serpentine pipe (tig. 98), collected from Uoss County, 
Ohio, by Mr. H. L. Keynolds, 
is somewhat of the same type 
as the preceding, though tlieie 
is a notable difference in the 
size of the stem hole, which is 
here five-eighths of an inch in 
diameter in place of one eighth 
of an inch, as is usual in pipes 
of the monitor type. It should 
be stated that in referring to 
the material from Avhich pipes 
are made the writer has in most 
cases been obliged to form his 
opinion from surface indica- 
tions, as specimens would be 
injured by a chemical or micro- 
scopic examination, the results of which at best could make little dif- 
ference. While the majority of pipes are made of materials well calcu- 
lated to resist heat, many are composed of stones easily decomposed 

and very unsuited to last any length of 
time if used in smoking. 

A broken-stemmed pipe (fig. 99), of 
oolitic limestone, with its flaring rim, the 
shape of its stem and slight prow and 
sides extending beyond the base of the 
bowl, appears to connect the two last 
figures with pipes of the " monitor '' type. 
There are no marks of metal tools on this 
pipe, which is a well-worn specimen, the 
bowl at one point, just below the rim, be- 
ing worn through. A pottery pipe similar 
to this specimen was found in a stone grave 
in Kentucky. It should be observed that 
the three pipes last figured are from geo- 
graphical areas outside of the territory 
where the monitor pipes are usually found, 
and their resemblance to the latter form may be due to accident. 
The country adjoining the lakes was more influenced by French than 
by English arts, and it may also be said that trade routes differed 
as well. 

One of the most striking things concerning the monitor ])ipes, with 
their alate wings and projecting prow, is the high state of polish to

which their surfaces have been brought. There are a sufficient num- 
ber of pipes of this chiss in the museums of the country to demon- 
strate tlie kinship of those in which the bowl and stem are in the same 
plane with those in which the bowl is at right augles to the stem. 

These pipes are represented in the U. S. National Museum in speci- 
mens from Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, 
North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, and, 
as noted, possibly from Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin. Their charac- 
teristics are usually as pronounced as are those of the English trade 
pipe type. As the angle of the stem and bowl of this 
pipe, in its evolution or variation, departs from the 
straight line or tubular form and approaches a right 
angle to the stem it is noted that the prow increases 
in length until it becomes as long as its stem, and the 
sides of the bowl's base broaden to a corresponding- 
degree. They are so often found in mound burials 
as to entitle them to be classed 
among the mound types; and, in- 
deed, the typical mound pipe has^ 
much in its form to suggest a kin- 
ship with the monitor pipe. 

There is a j)ronounced monitor 
pipe in the Peabody Academy of 
Sciences in Salem, Massachusetts, 
catalogued as from Maryland — a State that is distinctly within the area 
of the monitor form — a more particular history of which could not be 
obtained. 

Prof. F. W. Putnam refers to a pipe of this type found in a grave in 
Massachusetts, and says the flat portion of the specimen is bored with 
a number of holes for the attachment of ornaments.^ 

The same type, according to Mr. Harry Piers, has been found in 
Halifax County, Nova Scotia.^ 
Prof. G. H. Perkins refers to it in the Champlain Valley, Vermont.^ 
The Peabody Academy of Sciences owns several found in Beverly, 
Massachusetts, and they have been found in New York, in Oneida, 
Onondaga, and Cayuga counties.^

have come under observation are made from a dark green steatite or 
chlorite, a stone quite common alonj;' the Athmtic coast north of the 
Chesapeake. These pipes have bowls and stems at right angles to 
each other, and have invariably a beast or bird the head of which pro- 
jects above the bowl on the side away from but facing the smoker. 
Gen. A. L. Pridemore has a specimen found in Lee County, Virginia. 
Quite a large pipe in an unfinished conditiou is from Bradford County, 
Pennsylvania, col- 
lected by Messrs. (). 
H. P. Kinney and J. 
B. Wiggins. It ap- 
pears to have been 
sawed out with metal 
tools. It is 10 inches 
long, 4i inches high, 
with a diameter of 
bowl of 1^ inches. 
As seen in fig. 100, 
it is completely 
blocked out and is in 
a condition to indi- 
cate that it was in- 
tended to be completed, representing some creature grasping the bowl 
with all four legs, the head projecting li inches above the adjacent rim 
of the bowl. On the sides depressions have been gouged out with a tool 
with a round back, single strokes measuring over 1 inch in length, the 
smoothness of which indicates that it was a metal gouge. The bowl 
and stem holes, bored by means of metal drill points, are respectively 

five-eighths and 
five- sixteenths of 
an inch in diame- 
ter. The stem is 
broken at a depth 
of 1^ inches where 
the drill has en- 
countered a llaAV, 
which accounts for 
its having been 
cast aside. We see 
here much of the 
process of manu- 
facture of the elaborate stone pipe, the specimen first being rudely out- 
lined; next the bowl and stem were bored, then the elaboration of carv- 
ing was completed, leaving the polishing to the last.

high. The bowl of tins pipe is 1^ inches in exterior diameter. Though 
the stem is 7 inches long to its i^oint of junction with the bowl, it 
does not exceed three eighths of an inch in its greatest diameter. The 
creature on the bowl appears to be intended to represent a bird, 
though, whatever it be, it is inclined to the left and has incised lines 
on the back as though intended to represent wings. On the breast 
there are marks in one i)lace, apparently made by a file, and on the 
bowl similar marks are seen. The individual making the pipe has 
failed to obliterate the tool marks in smoothing the surface, which in 
this instance has an unusually good polish. Without the figure the 
pipe is in outline similar to the briarwood pipes of the present day. 
The material is steatite such as has been worked by the natives along 
the whole Atlantic coast. This pipe was found near Bainbridge dur- 
ing the excavation of the Pennsylvania Canal. A similar pipe, but 
an inch shorter, belonging to the Hon. W. J. Almon, of Halifax, is 
spoken of by Mr. Harry Piers as being the most remarkable one found 
in the Provinces. It was discovered in 1870 under an upturned copper 
kettle within 10 rods of an old French trail in Hants County, Ontario. 
It is said to have a well-carved lizard grasping the bowl, while "across 
the back of the neck appears a row of five elliptical cavities, their 
greatest length being in the direction of the body." ' 

The material of which these pipes in the north are made is described 
as a fine-grained stone, probably a steatite, the elliptical depressions on 
which call to mind cavities noticeable among the stone and clay pipes 
of the St. Lawrence River and northwestern New York, such as are 
supposed to have been employed by the Iroquoian tribes. 

There is a cast in the U. S. National Museum collection of a pipe of 
this type (Cat. No. 13804), having the same long stem, which is said to 
have been found in a mound in Warren County, Ohio, collected bj' 
Mr. J. H. Jenkins, and upon which an animal faces the smoker from the 
far side of the bowl, as in those pipes of similar type herein figured. 

The Kev. William M. Beauchamp calls the writer's attention to a clay 
pipe of this general type, though much smaller, which was found in Jef- 
ferson County, New York, upon the bowl of which there was repre- 
sented a crayfish with one claw broken off, though such a pipe would 
appear to belong rather to tiie Iroquoian type. Mr. Beauchamp also ' 
states that turtles are often represented in the same way, as are many 
animals and birds on pipes of the Iroquoian type. 

Mr. David Boyle illustrates a pipe of white stone, which was found 
on Baptiste Lake, Hastings County, Ontario, upon the outer side of 
which the animal holds the bowl in the grasp of its four legs, while its 
tail reaches down the bowl and under it and along the stem - in the 
direction of its longest axis.

AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 477 

The stone from which the French Canadians early made pipes is, 
according to Peter Kalm, the Swedish traveler and botanist, a lime- 
stone fonnd in strata between the lime slate of the country, and which 
he calls pierre a calumet. These rectangular pipes, having birds or 
other creatures in relief on their bowls, were made, in all probability, 
either with tools obtained from the whites, or by the whites themselves. 
The gouge marks in the bowl, the sharp striiie of the drill, the high 
polish, and tile marks, all go to confirm this belief, while the finding of 
one of them under a coi)per kettle identifies pipe and kettle as con- 
temporaneous. These, together with the artistic treatment of the sub- 
ject, seems to indicate a stage of development above and beyond 
primitive conditions. This suggestion will probably be combated, 
though a careful comparison of American Indian pipes carved in imi- 
tation of different members of the animal kingdom, are so little like 
those fetiches which are known to be of purely Indian origin, the tool 
marks of knife or file are so distinct, and the treatment of the subject 
so clearly European, as to leave but little doubt of their modern origin. 

There is evidence of the existence at an early colonial period of metal 
pipes, both of copy^er and of iron, but few have survived owing to the 
corrosive effects and the dampness of our soil. Those of iron were of 
European origin, while co})per inpes were possibly of pre-Europeau 
date. Judging from allusions by early writers, the Indians in places 
also made pipes of wood and of bone, though none appear to have 
been discovered, excepting those tubes of cane which were buried in 
certain jilaces in Xew Mexico. 

Atwater says: " Pipe bowls made of copper, hammered out and not 
welded together but lapped over, have been found in many tumuli. 
General Tupper described such an one to me, found by him on the ele- 
vated square at ^Marietta, or rather a few feet below that work, and 
similar ones have been discovered in other places."^ 

Haywood reiterates a similar remark in reference to the finding of 
hammered copper unwelded pipe bowls in the mounds of Tennessee,^ 
and calls attention to the finding of objects of gold, silver, and copper 
and of coins in the mounds. 

Hendrick Hudson, in 1GU9, speaks of the people of New York on the 
east sand bank in the Narrows who " came aboard us and brought 
tobacco. They have great pipes of yellow copper, and pots of earth to 
dress their meats in.'"^ 

The memory of such pipes had survived to the end of the last cen- 
tury, for Kalm, speaking of the same locality, says, "However, they 
[the Indians] knew in some measure how to make use of copper.

478 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

Some Dutcbuieu who lived here still preserved the old account among 
them that their ancestors on their first settling- in New York had met 
with many Indians who had tobacco pipes of copper, and who made 
them understand by signs that they got them in the neighborhood. 
Afterwards the tine copper mine was found upon the second river 
between Elizabethtown and New York." ' 

In a monograph of the archieology of Ohio, Mr. M. C. Eead speaks of 
hammered copper pipes as being very uncommon, he having seen only 
one specimen.^ Squier and Davis express their belief that the North 
American Indians possessed the knowledge of some secret or forgotten 
process by which copper was hardened.' This is an assertion which 
has often been advanced by archiieologists, referring to metal used both 
in South America and in Egypt, but for which assertion there appears 
no foundation other than that, as these peoples carved hard stone, and 
had no iron, therefore they must have known how to harden copper. 
Since, however, it has been demonstrated that the stone hammer, com- 
mon to all parts of the earth, could cut the most obdurate stones with 
ease and dispatch, such assertions must be received with great caution. 

Dr. E. A. Barber refers to a copper pipe found in Montour County, 
Pennsylvania, concerning which he expresses doubt as to whether it be 
aboriginal, and suggests that it may have been traded to the Indians 
by Europeans,^ though if the natives hammered copper there is no 
reason why they should not have formed it into tubes. Another 
tobacco pipe, made of lead, was found in an Indian grave at Eevere, 
Massachusetts.-' 

The writer has seen a tomahawk pipe made of tin or lead, now in the 
museum of the University of Pennsylvania, which wasi)robably of the 
date of the American Ee volution, if not later. 

A large number of stone pipes in the IT. S. National Museum col- 
lection, which were found in North and South Carolina and Georgia, 
are made of a dark green chlorite, which is of a color suggestive of 
copper. These pipes have usually embossed disks upon their bowls, 
and tongues reaching from stem to bowl, carved in a manner to leave 
little doubt that they had metal prototypes. 

Metal pipes are recorded of so many various types and have been 
found in so many different localities as to suggest their common use at 
a very early period. Most of these iiipes, however, are either cast or 
brazed, or are of a form which is quite modern, though one specimen 
made of lapped sheet metal is probably of aboriginal workmanship, 
though possibly of a post-European date. Although the writer is of 
opinion that metal pipes do not antedate European occupation of the

country, it must be admitted that the evidence relating to their age is 
of so fragmentary a character as not to warrant the positive exjuession 
of an opinion on the subject. 

De Soto as early as 1539 with a hxrge body of men crossed an exten- 
sive section of the southern portion of what is now the United States. 
His people were familiar with the working and fusing of metals, and sev- 
eral of his soldiers wandered off and were never heard from again, and 
he is supposed to have penetrated far toward the borders of Ken- 
tucky.' Fifty years later the English landed in Virginia, and from that 
period for one hundred and fifty years Spanish, French, English, Dutch, 
and Swedes traded along the coast and far into the interior with the 
natives for their peltries, and their intercourse was of a character to 
familiarize them with the white man's implements and his use of metal. 

Mr. Clarence B. Moore found at Fairview, Camden County, Georgia, 
a foot below the surface in a mound, a deposit of calcined human bones 
beneath a local layer of oyster shells, and associated with the bones 
was a sheet-copper ornament with repousse decorations.- He refers 
also to four rings found on the finger of a skeleton at Madisonville, 
Ohio, by Professor Putnam, which were made from bands of sheet 
copper. Besides finding a copper finger ring in a mound near Wood- 
bine, Georgia, and also a portion of a disk of copper in a mound in 
Mcintosh County, Georgia, which was carbonated through, Mr. Moore 
also found an 8-inch copper celt in a mound north of Creighton Island, 
Georgia.' 

Such objects are said to be usually found near the surface, and poly- 
chrome and other glass beads were found in the mounds at a depth of 
2 feet with human remains or near the surface.^ 

Glass beads, pieces of china, copper coins, gold ornaments, and silver 
crosses have been found on so many occasions in the graves and mounds 
of the interior associated with human remains as to suggest that the 
trade with the whites was considerable at a period when mounds were 
still being constructed and while the Indian was yet living under 
primitive conditions, 

MICMAC PIPES. 

As far south as the borders of Kentucky and extending as far as the 
Blackfeet wander, in Labrador and across the continent almost if not 
quite to the Pacific Ocean, there is found a type of pipe which appears 
quite primitive in form, yet which is still in use in the northern part of 
the continent. It has a bowl, in shape not unlike an inverted acorn, 
wbich sits upon a keel-like base, broadest where it touches the bowl, 
and extending beyond the bowl at times an inch or more on each side.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897 




Through the top of this base or keel there is drilled a stem hole one-half 
its length until it intersects at right angles the base of the bowl. The 
tops of these terraced bases are seldom more than half an inch wide, 
though from front to back tliey are often 3 inches or more long, and 
from top to bottom tliey are as deep as long. The sides of the bases are 
parallel to each other, and are in two or three terraces, decreasing often 
until the lower part of the base is scarcelj^ more than one-eighth of an 
inch thick. Through this base there are almost invari- 
ably one or more perforations. 

That the northern tribes have long been familiar 
with carving must be admitted, for Lescarbot says of 
the Micmacs ' they "have the industry both of paint- 
ing and carving, and do make pictures of birds, beasts, 
and of men, as well in stone as iu wood, as prettily as 
is done by good workmen in these parts; and notwith- 
standing they serve not themselves with them in adora- 
tion, but only to please the sight, they use some private 
tools, as in making tobacco pipes." ^ 

Prof. Daniel Wilson refers to Pabamesad, or the 

Flier, still living on the Great Manitoulin Island, 

generally known as Pwahguueka, the pipe maker, 

literally, "he makes pipes." "His saw, with which 

the stone is first roughly blocked out, is made of a bit 

of hoop iron, and his other tools are correspondingly 

rude; nevertheless the work of Pabamesad shows 

him to be a master of his art." ^ 

Professor Wilson refers to the black pipestone of Lake Huron, the 

white pii)estone from St. Josephs Islaud, Lake Huron, and the red 

pipestone of Coteau des Prairies, all obtained from the different tribes 

using these stones. 

Gilpin says the Micmacs used "shallow stone pans with quills and 
reeds stuck in them, but did not cultivate tobacco."^ 

The only shallow stone pan apparently answering such description 
would be the disk or jew's-harp pipe usually found to the southward, 
though examples have been encountered on the northern side of Lake 
Huron. 

Fig. 102 is a finegrained, brown, argillaceous stone pipe, about 2 
inches high, with a greatest diameter of three-fourths of an inch, from 
^Newark, Ohio, collected by Mr. W. Anderson. It is ground over its 
whole surface; the bowl has an interior uniform diameter of five-eighths

of an inch, carried to a depth of seven-eighths of an inch, and in this 
respect resembles the mound pipes. At the base of the bowl a one- 
eighth inch hole perforates the stem oi)eniiig, which enters through the 
longer axis of the base. The keel-like bases of these pipes are almost 
iuvariably bored from side to side with holes from one-sixteenth to 
one-eighth of an inch in diameter, for the purpose of attaching strings 
to prevent loss in the snow, leaves, or grass, it being noticeable that 
the pipes of those places where deep snows commonly lie are more apt 
to be of a shape indicating a string attachment for the stem than 
are those found in warmer latitudes. A sjiecimen similar to this pipe 
(Cat. No. 115452, U. S. N. M.), from a mound at Prairie du Ohien, Wis- 
consin, collected by Mr. J. W. Emmert, is composed of an almost white 
limestone, possibly the Avhite pipestoue of Lake Huron. It has a bowl 
in the shape of an elongated cone, gradually lessen- 
ing toward its base, the whole pipe being 3 inches 
high, and has the lateral perforation so commonly 
observed. 

The Rev. W. M. Beaucharap refers to another pipe 
of this type which he attributes to Seneca ownership 
and thinks the type recent. A similar pipe was 
found near Waterloo, Dekalb County, Indiana. 

Fig. 103 is a modern pipe, having a stem of spruce 
wood, from Ungava, Labrador, collected by Mr. 
Lucien M. Turner, and is of a blood red banded slate, 
with yellow veins running through it. It is 3i inches 
high, the bowl decreasing in diameter to half an inch 
at the point where it joins the keel-like base, the stem 
being attached to the pipe by a fine sinew yarn. There 
are three lines, two at the bottom and one near the 
rim, and incised on the bowl; on the base file marks 
are distinct. Mr. Turner says of these pipes: ''They 
vary but little in shape and are liable to crack if used in cold weather, 
and there is considerable difference in size. The largest ones are made 
of green stones. The rough stone for the pipe is selected and chipped 
into form. The successive operations of wearing it down are accom- 
plished by means of a coarse file or harder stone." ^ 

It is surprising to find evidences of the use of the file on the surfaces 
of so many pipes of stone which are considered to belong to the most 
primitive periods. The pipe of the DentS who live between 50=^ and 
52° 30' north latitude and between the Fraser River and the Cascade 
range of mountains, is identical in type with these pipes. Father 
Morice remarks: "A fact which will perhaps elicit incredulous com- 
ment is that not only our aborigines' earliest acquaintance with tobacc;o, 
native or nicotian, dates only from 1792 for the Tse Kehne, and 1793

for the Carriers, but even the very act of smoking was unknown to them 
prior to those dates. As a consequence, pipes of any material or form 
are an adventitious item amongst them. Bowl and stem are connected 
by a chain of dentahum shells alternating with colored glass beads. A 
pipe similar in form, but without the string of beads and shells, was 
also in use among the Shushwap Indians, the southern neighbors of 
the western Denes, as ajjpears from a sketch in Dawson's notes on the 
Shushwap Indians proper of British Columbia." ^ 

This author asserts that "both the Tse Kehne and the Carriers are 
positive tobacco was unknown to their ancestors previous to their 
encounter with Sir Alexander McKenzie."^ 
A pipe of this character from the Shushwap people of British Colum- 
bia, between the Fraser River and Thompson River, 
is described by Dr. George M. Dawson.' 

An ornamented pipe (fig. 104) of this type from Fort 
Niagara, New York, collected by Col. E. Jewett, is 3 
inches high, the bowl having an exterior greatest diam- 
eter of If inches. The base is wedge shaped, between 
which and the bowl there is a narrow neck or shoulder 
cut iu octagon. The stone is a black slate, probably 
the black pipestoneof Lake Huron, to which Professor 
Wilson referred. The bowl is ornamented with per- 
pendicular and circular parallel lines in panels, the 
base having small depressions around three of its sides 
and two straight lines crossing each other which have 
been incised with a steel tool apparently. A pipe 
through the base of which are two holes, one above 
the other, is referred to by Piers, " the bowl and keel of 
which are most tastefully ornamented with single and 
double straight lines, dots, very short diagonal dashes, 
and conventional branches of foliage, all arranged in 
neat design, which entitle the carver to much credit for his excellent 
work." * 

The same author refers to another specimen of the Micmac pipe, 
" the base of which is cut into three lobes, each of which has a small 
perforation through it, probably for the j)urpose of attaching some orna- 
ment." This pipe was found near the river Dennis, Cape Breton. Yet 
another, though more finely finished, was found at Dartmouth iu 1870, 
with only one hole through the keel, and a similar one made of red

clay was found at Halifax wliic^b was considered to be of European 
manufacture, on one side of the base of wbicb is scratched 1560, to 
which, Ml". Piers thinks, no importance can be attached.' 

Prof. John Robinson, of the Peabody Academy of Science, Salem, 
Massachusetts, refers the writer to yet another specimen of this class, 
from Mickeltield, Pictou County, Nova Scotia, having an ornamented 
keel-like base, perforated with live holes. The pipe is made of talcose 
slate, nearly black in color, and was found 5 feet below the surface in 
digging a well. The locality where this pipe was lound has been settled 
for one hundred and fifty years. Professor Eobinson thinks the x)ipe 
was certainly made with a knife and other steel tools, and as it is fresh, 
clean cut, he supposes it either to have been made by a white man and 
given to the Indians, or, if made by the Indians, that it was done with 
a white man's tools. 

Another pipe of this type, from Grosse Poiute, Lake St. Clair, Michi- 
gan, is referred to in the Smithsonian Eeport of 1873 as '' an object worthy 
of some admiration, though wanting in symmetry in its details. In its 
general appearance it is almost elegant, and even graceful. It is formed 
of greenstone and is beautifully polished, the workmanship, as a whole, 
displaying much skill. This singular relic is in perfect preservation, 
with the exception of part of the base of the bowl, which in shape 
resembles a half-closed tulip, a small portion is also wanting. The 
date 1697, inscribed on one side of the base, is of interest. The an- 
tiquity of the pipe is, in my estimation, much greater than this would 
imply. The date of the settlement of Detroit is 1701, but the Jesuits 
and other white men had already penetrated to this region many years 
before." ' 

Hind refers to a pipe of this type which Mis tick oos, a Cree, when re- 
lating his adventures, raised the pipe he held in his hand and exclaimed : 
"This is what my Blackfoot friend gave me one day; the next he killed 
my young men; he is now my enemy again." ^ 

Holm's remark, referring to New Sweden, "that the Indians leaned 
upon their pipes," would be received with incredulity were it not that 
Hind represents "the Fox," a Plains Cree Indian, holding in his hand 
a pipe upon which he leans as one would upon a staff'.* 

The office of custodian of the great pipe is an important one among 
the Blackfeet, according to Warren, who asserts that a person "is 
appointed every four years by the elders and chiefs to take charge of 
the sacred pipe, pipestem, mat, and other emblems of their religious 
beliefs. A lodge is allotted for his especial use to contain these emblems

aud articles pertaining to his office." ' The Blackfoot pipes " are often 
ball or pear sliape, a foot in length. The stem is of wood, broad, flat, 
or round — at times like a snake. The handsomest are the great medi- 
cine pipes. The tobacco they smoke consists of the little round dry 
leaves of the bearberry {arctostaphylos nva-ursi), called by them Kock- 
sinn."^ Hind illustrates several of these pipes, selected from his own 
collection, that are from the Cree, Blackfeet, and Chipewayau tribes.^ 
Schoolcraft also illustrates the same pipe as Chipewayau.^ 

There is in the collection of the U. S. National Museum a cast of a 
pipe of this type said to be from Putnam County, Ohio (Cat. No. 58169), 
which represents in its bowl the head of an individual, apparently a 
European, which is i^robably of quite a recent period. 

A pipe from Oriskany, JS^ew York, collected 
by Col. E. Jewett, 2| inches high, made from a 
gray steatite, appears to be rather a crude eifort 
to represent the head aud beak of a bird, and is 
shown iu fig. 105. The bowl and stem are with- 
out ornament, excepting five small dots in a row, 
one above the other, extending along a facet be- 
tween the bird's beak aud the top of the stem. 
A hole in the base for the string is scarcely more 
than one-sixteenth of an inch iu diameter, the 
cavity of the bowl being seven-eighths of an inch 
in diameter, the sides of the interior of the bowl 
being parallel, a common but not invariable fea- 
ture iu pipes of this type. 

By far the most ornate specimen of a i)ipe of 
this type yet described is one (fig. 106) in the col- 
lection of Mr. E. A, Douglass, which is 3^ inches 
high and 1^ inches wide and made from a close- 
grained dark brown stone. On its baseare circles and lines iu ornamental 
order which would answer the description of the Micmac pipe described 
by Mr. Piers; but there is a further ornamentation which adds greatly to 
its interest. Surrounding the bowl are four animals, carved practically 
in the round, which are apparently intended to have a totemic signifi- 
cance. Standing on the narrow keel base, with his back to the stem, is 
a bear, his two hind feet on the stem, while with his fore paws he 
appears to be reaching up as though endeavoring to get into the bowl; 
the end of his muzzle is even with the upper edge. Facing the bear, 
on the other end of the bowl, with its tail touching the stem, also erect 
and clasping the bowl with all four legs, is another animal, apparently

an otter. On the bear's rigbt, also climbing the bowl, is a beaver at 
full length, while oi)posite the beaver is a terrapin, or turtle, also 
clasping the bowl and trying to climb to the top. The beaver's head 
is even with that of the bear, as were presumably the heads of the otter 
and terrai)in. which, unfortunately, have been broken oft" at the neck. 
The shell of the turtle, the scales of his legs, and his claws, and the 
hair and limbs of the other animals are carved with the minutest regard 
to detail. The etching of semicir- 
cles, circles, conventional branches 
of plants, dots, straight and curved 
lines, 'all bear evidence of foreign 
influences and metal tools, every de- 
tail being executed Mith such skill 
and taste as to leave no doubt of its 
being the work of an artist. Such 
care in the manufacture of a stone 
pipe is proof of its being intended 
for a person of importance, or a pres- 
ent on some occasion of unusual 
significance between the French or 
p]nglish and the Indians. The ani- 
mals here represented are all totems 
of the Iroquois, and are said also to 
be those of all the tribes from Lou- 
isiana to Montreal.* 

This pipe is said to have been 
found on the bank of the St. John 
lliver, in northeastern Maine. 
There are in the Bragge collection 
pipes apparently of this type from 
the area where these are referred to 
as being found : One, from Canada, 
having upon it two beavers and 
two smaller animals; one, from be- 
low Quebec, with two dogs aiid two 
bears upon it; one, from an island 
below Qnebec, having on it an eagle, 
monkey, bear, cat,°and a dog; another, two bears, a fox, and a bird, 
all apparently of this Micmac type. 

A gTaceful little pipe of catlinite (fig. 107) collected by Mr. J. Peters, 
from Kentucky, If inches high, upon the stem of M'hich the figures 
1717 are rudely incised, is quite an artistic affair. Whether these 
figures indicate an actual date, however, is a matter impossible to 
determine. Tlie bowl is badly broken, though the base is whole and 
consists of a crouching animal, and has a single hole for the string.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 




The specimen being highly polished would, indicate a probable modern 
origin. The bowl and stem both have thin walls and the nnusually 
large apertnre of the stem is the only departure observable from type 
characteristics. 

This type, it will be observed, extends practically from the Atlantic 
to the Pacific, through the territories of Athabascan, Iro(iuoian, and 
Algonquin linguistic stocks, and so commonly 
shows file marks and high jiolish as to suggest 
the white man's presence, for it is scarcely neces- 
sary to say the file could not be acquired from 
native sources, and high polish of implements is 
almost unknown through the center of the Amer- 
ican continent among tools of purely aboriginal 
make until the Indians possessed a supply of the 
white man's implements. This type is undoubt- 
edly an old one, and some of the specimens bear 
evidence of being made with primitive tools, 
though the territory through which they are dis- 
tributed is that of the Hudson Bay Fur Trading 
Company, and very likely is of a type sold by them 
to the Indians. The dates on these pipes add inter- 
est to them beyond a mere record of their i)ossession 
by the whites at a given 
period. The file mark 
may be the only evidence of its having sup- 
planted the gritty stone in the Indian's hand, 
and the polish only indicative of a natural 
advance over the primitive ground surface. 

Mr. Beauchamp has called the writer's at- 
tention to a i^eculiar pipe, made from black 
steatite, found in Onondaga County, New 
York, the bowl of which is shaped like a 
man's head, the eyes "inlaid with hollow 
bone," the type of face being European. The 
stem hole is at right angles to the bowl, but 
is smaller than is the case with the Micmac 
pipe; a projection below the bowl may be in- 
tended as a handle to hold it by when hot. 
A somewhat similar outline is noted in a pipe 
made of steatite, and found in 1844,' illustrated by Schoolcraft, said to 
be from the Grave Creek Mound in Virginia. 

A fair specimen of these pipes is one (fig. 108) from a mound in 
London County, Tennessee, collected by Mr. J. W. Emmert, which has 
this projecting base extending below the bowl, the stone being a 
greenish serpentine or steatite, on the surface of which the flle marks

are quite distinct. The specimen is 2J inches high and 2 inches long, 
the shape of the bowl opening being of a distinctly elliptical form, 
similar to certain of the typical mound pipes. Another pipe of this 
character was found at Newark, Ohio, on the bowl of which there was 
an animal head. 

A specimen of the same type in the collection of the Davenport 
Academy of Natural Sciences was found in Jo Daviess County, Illinois, 
and is made of pipestoue of slightly greenish tinge. 

DISK PIPES. 

There is a pipe of most peculiar shape, known commonly as the 
"disk pipe," so called from the discoidal stem, which at first glance 
one would be apt to take for its bowl. The larger cavity being in a 
line parallel to the face of the disk would suggest 
that the stem was intended to be inserted through 
the disk, around which a thong would be tied to 
hold it more firmly in i)Osition, the depth of the disk 
being insufticient to hold a stem unless it were 
bound in some way. 

A longitudinal section of such pipes shows simi- 
larity in bowl and stem hole to pipes found in the 
State of Missouri, though the exteriors are very 
unlike. This similarity is pronounced in a pipe of 
oolitic limestone from Chattanooga, which is illus- 
trated by Thruston.' 

A badly weathered white limestone specimen (fig. 
109) of this type is from a mound in Union County, 
Kentucky, collected by Mr. S. S. Lyon. It is 3J 
inches long, and only li inches from the face of the 
disk to the opi^osite side of the pipe, the disk being 
li inches in diameter, with a bowl cavity of five- 
eighths of an inch diameter, by one-half an inch for 
size of the stem opening. Thruston illustrates two 
specimens of this type made of catlinite, one com- 
ing from the Noel stone grave cemetery, near Nashville, Tennessee.^ 
In the Douglass collection there are six catlinite i)ipes of this character 
from Boone, Saline, and Chariton counties, Missouri. 

Mr. David Boyle, of Toronto, also describes two of these pipes, one 
from Middlesex County, and the other from Huron County, Ontario, 
one of which was made trom catlinite. The bowls and stems are 
usually carefully drilled, and their exteriors are remarkably well 
polished. Dr. E. A. Barber describes pipes of this type from mounds 
in Missouri.^

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 




A specimen (tig. 110) of this type, part of the stem of which is miss- 
ing-, from Moimt Carmel, Wabash County, Illinois, collected by Mr. J. 
Schenck, is made of light brown oolitic limestone. In its perfect state 
it was about 5 inches long, and is so carefully smoothed as to leave 
no visible marks of the tools by means of which it was made. Finding 
them of catlinite so far from the quarries would indicate that they are 
of no great age. Again, the shape is so suggestive of the jew's-harp, an 
instrument used extensively in trade with the Indians, as to indicate 
that the pipe itself is modeled after the form of this primitive musical 
instrument, even though the file marks, so common on many of the pipes, 
are absent from those coming under the writer's observa- 
tion. A highly polished specimen was also found in a 
mound near Greenville, Bond County, Illinois. 

IROQUOIAN PIPES. 

Throughout an extensive territory surrounding the 
Great Lakes is found a type of i)ipe distinct from those 
of other portions of the continent, which is so peculiarly 
distributed throughout the geographical area inhabited 
by the Northern Iroquoian groups as to justify calling 
the type "Iroquoian." 

Powell's linguistic map shows that at the time of the 
first contact with the whites Iroquoian was the language 
spoken by the Indians on both sides of the upper St. 
Lawrence Eiver, as well as by the tribes living around tbe 
shores of Lakes Ontario and Erie, covering the territory 
of a greater part of the State of New York and of north- 
ern and eastern Pennsylvauia as well. These iMpes are 
common throughout the greater portion of this area, but 
are not found in the territory of the Southern Iroquois, 
in West Virginia, North and South Carolina, eastern 
Tennessee, part of northern Alabama, and Georgia. The 
constancy of type in pipes through a given area is uniform, with but little 
variation, and as a consequence there should be found a similarity in the 
pipes of the Northern and Southern Iroquoian areas if they dated from 
a period prior to the separation of the race. Pipes of the Iroquoian 
type are made both of stone and jiottery, the stone being usually a 
stalagma and the pottery commonly a hard-burned clay without shell 
tempering. These pipes are trumpet shaped quite often, though rec 
tangular bowls are common. At times they have human heads molded 
on them, at others the figures are of birds or reptiles, all of which usu- 
ally face the smoker, though there are numerous exceptions to this rule. 
The rims of the bowls are often of uniform height, but the edges of some 
of them are undulating owing to birds or beasts being molded on to 
the tops of the bowls. The stems of pottery iiipes of this type are com- 
paratively short, and their openings quite small, are equaled only by the

modern Zniii or Pueblo pipes. The stems of Iroqnoian stone pipes are 
nearly at right angles to the bowls, whereas the curves in the pottery 
specimens are similar to those of the metal hunting horn of the Euro- 
pean. Another peculiar characteristic of Iroqnoian pipes is the form 
of the bowl, copied apparently from the hats of the soldiers of colonial 
days, with their high curved front, often affording space for the repre- 
sentation of standing or seated figures, which look as though ooi>ied 
from the sacred pictures or figures of the French churches. Another 
characteristic of the pipe of almost the whole of the Iroqnoian area is 
observed in a series of ellipsoidal depressions upon the pipe bowl, the 
significance of which it is difficult to explain, though it is common on 
both stone and potterj^ examples. There is still another type of pipe 
that belongs to this region which has no stem, the form being that of a 
bird or animal always facing from the smoker. 

The writer is inclined to attribute no great age to any of these orna- 
mented Iroqnoian pipes, at least none which would antedate French 
influences, though it is of course admitted that the smoking habit was 
noted upon the first arrival of the Europeans. So far as a knowledge 
of the artificial fracture of stones is concerned, or the haunts and habits 
of wild animals, or ability to follow the tracks of game, or, in fact, all 
outdoor knowledge incident to the forest or the prairie, the Indian was 
a past master; but the white man's arrival must have been as remark- 
able to the Indian as would be to-day a visit to earth from citizens of 
another planet, and the implements brought from Europe must have 
appeared marvelous." 

It is related that during Cartier's second voyage to the St. Lawrence, 
in 1535, the captain commanded the trumpets and other musical instru- 
ments to sound for the purpose of surprising the natives, and there can 
be little doubt that the monotony of many a long voyage during the six- 
teenth and the seventeenth centurj^ was relieved by the sounds of music, 
of which all vessels carried a good supply. In the account of Sir Hum- 
phrej^ Gilbert's voyage in 1583 to the northern part of Newfoundland it 
is related "that for solace of our people and allurement of the savages 
we were provided of music in good variety, not omitting the least 
toys, as Morris dancers, hobbyhorse, and many like conceits to de- 
light the savage people whom we intended to win by all fair means 
possible." ^ 

Champlain, in 1003, relates that he "saw on an island 10 miles from 
Quinibequy [Quebec] 'petun [tobacco], which they also cultivated;'^ 
and he further says "they gave us (luantities of petun, which they dry 
and then reduce to powder."^ 

The French appear to have adopted to a great extent the word j>e/M?«; 
for tobacco, a word, judging by early writers, derived from Brazil, 
Dawson says "the pipes- of old Hochelega were mostly of clay, and of

490 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

many and sometimes elegant patterns; some were very plain and small, 
others of elegant cornucopia or trumpet form, and some ornamented 
with rude attempts to imitate the human face." ' One somewhat elabo- 
rate example appears to have been found of the celebrated red pipestone 
or catlinite. 

Had primitive pipes been of such a character, it is scarcely credible 
that Cartier would not have made some reference to so great a peculiar- 
ity. Lafitau, however, does refer to the pii)e as a "cornet,'' owing 
clearly to its trumpet form, which was very pronounced among certain 
of these Iroquoian objects. 

Prof. G. H. Perkins describes the pipes of the Ohamplain Valley 
region as "not so elaborate as those in Ohio, only two specimens having 
been found with faces on them. The stone used was steatite, gypsum, 
limestone, and slate; platform, bell shaped, trumpet shaped, and tubu- 
lar i^ieces occur; the last named in common form, varying from 2 to 15 
inches in length."^ 

Hochelega was on the site now occupied by Montreal, and Dawson 
informs us that the Iroquois, Hurons, and Crees had pipes of the same 
types with those of Hochelega.* 

Lafitau (1724) tells us : " Every savage has always with him his petun 
sack, in which he carries his calumet, or pipe, tobacco, and the means 
of lighting a fire," but he also says, "they never march without carry-, 
ing with them a long tube, through which they draw smoke almost to 
drunkenness; with it they shake up all the fibers of their brain, and 
become intoxicated, as if they had drunk wine to excess."^ 

He could certainly not have referred to any pii)e of the Canadian 
country adjoining the lakes, for none had long stems, so far as we 
know, excei^t the Micmac pipe. The Abbe Gallini'e, in 1669, referring 
to the Falls of Niagara, speaks of the Outinaonatona (big-pipe people, 
Hewitt), Senecas.^ 

Dawson refers to tobacco being found in full force by Cartier, in 
1535, and says it was probably cultivated at Stadacona and Hochelega. 
He says that he has seen tobacco growing on the Laurentian Hills, 
behind Murray Bay, on the lower St. Lawrence, in latitude 47° 40", 
and that the Indians also used wild plants designated as petun and 
killikinik.^ It should, however, be born in mind that little was known 
concerning tobacco as early as the first half of the sixteenth century, 
and the reference may well have pointed to sumac, red willow, bear 
berry, or even the sc^uawbush. 

The Kionontatehronon, a people living a two days' journey from the 
Hurons, and speaking that language, are referred to as the Nation de

Petnn as late as 1635.' These people, spoken of as Tionoiitates and 
Diououdades "were found in 161(), south of Lake Huron and just west 
of the Ilurons. After the Ilurons' defeat they were nearly destroyed 
in continuation of the same war.''- 

Kalm, in 1749, says of the Ilurons, "before them hangs their tobacco 
bag, made of the skin of an animal, the hairy side turned outwards, and 
each of the Indians," he says, "has a tobacco pipe of gray limestone, 
which is blackened afterwards, and lias a long tube of wood.""'^ 

These pipes do not appear to correspond in description to those now 
found in the Huron area of influence, though the tobacco bag was made 
much according to its owner's taste, and Kalm says that in Canada 
"every farmer plants a quantity of tobacco near his house in i)roportion 
to the size of his family. It is likewise very necessary that they should 
plant tobacco, because it is so universally smoked by the common peo- 
ple. Boys of 10 or 12 years of age run about with the pipe in their 
mouth as well as the old people. Persons above the vulgar do not 
refuse to smoke a pipe now and then. In the northern part of Canada 
they smoke tobacco by itself; but farther upward and about Montreal 
they take the inner bark of the red Cornelian cherry [Cornus stolonifera], 
crush it, and mix it with tobacco to make it weaker."^ 

In 1612 Fathers Eaymbault and Jogues left the mission of St. Mary, 
and after seventeen days' navigation arrived at the Falls, where they 
met about 10,000 persons, and "learned of many other sedentary peojde 
who never knew EuroiDean nations, among others the Nadouessis (Sioux), 
located northwest or west of the Falls. The first nine days they were 
traveling through another great lake, which begins above the Falls 
(Erie). The last nine days they travel through a river which runs into 
the land. These people cultivate corn and petnn." ^ 

The people referred to in 1667 as the Nadouessouek, " near the great 
river called the Messipi, are said to have lived in a prairie country 
abounding in all sorts of game. They have fields where they do not 
grow corn but only petnn."*' 

Of the "Mohawks, Oneydoes, Onondagos, Cayugas, and Senekas," in 
1724, according to Cadwallader Colden, it is said "that each of these 
nations is again divided into three tribes or families, who distinguish 
themselves by three different arms or ensigns, the Tortoise, the Bear, 
the Wolf." ' 

Eobert Rogers adds to this list, in 1765, of distinguishing ensigns or 
coats of arms, the otter and the eagle.**

492 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

Lewis H. Morgan siie(;ities, in 1851, eight tribes in eacli nation, 
arranged in two divisions, and names them as follows: Wolf, bear, 
beaver, turtle, deer, snipe, heron, hawk. These clan names, he says, 
are common to all latitudes between Montreal and Louisiana.^ 

This arrangement leaves out the classes of the otter and the eagle, 
referred to by Rogers. The more thorough our knowledge becomes of 
the Indian the more numerous appear his clans, and for each clan there 
is its appropriate totem. These totems are constantly represented on 
the Indian's pipe, scratched into the stone or carved in relief, or at 
times even carved in the round. 

One of the quaintest of references to tobacco, or plants used in the 
manner of tobacco, is that of Cartier, in 1635. He says : 

"There groweth also a certain kind of herbe, whereof in summer 
they make great provision for all the yeere, making great account of 
it, and only men use of it, and first thej' cause it to be dried in the 
sunne, then weare it about their neckes wrapped in a little beasts 
skinne made like a little bagge, with a hollow peece of stone or wood 
like a pipe, then when they please tbey make pouder of it, and then 
put it in one of the ends of said Cornet or pipe, and laying a cole of 
fire upon it, at the other end sucke so long, that they fill their bodies 
full of smoke, till that it cometh out of their mouth and nostrils even 
as out of the Tonnel of a chimney."^ 

This reference to the cornet would indicate that the pipe had the 
shape of the musical instrument or trumi^et, which form is very aucient, 
and is found among the oldest hammered bronze implements of Norway,' 
and probably the rest of Europe. The hunting horn is familiar to all 
and comes probably from a civilization antedating that of Europe. 
Eev. W. M. Beauchamp, of Baldwinsville, Kew York, one of the best 
authorities in the country on the Iroquoian pipe, says they rarely made 
stone pipes until they had metallic tools. Many nations, he says, made 
pipes to sell, as the Petuus of Canada, and the Narragan setts. They 
were offered to water spirits on Lake Champlain and elsewhere. The 
more recent Iroquoian pipes, he thinks, have the face usually turned 
from the smoker. The Iroquoian tomahawk pipes, according to Morgan, 
were " made of steel, brass, or iron. The choicer articles are surmounted 
by a pipe bowl, and have a perforated handle that they may answer the 
double purpose of ornament and use. In such the handle and often 
the blade itself are richly inlaid with silver. They use it in close com- 
bat with terrible effect, and also throw it with unerring certainty at 
distant objects, making it revolve in the air in its tiight. With the 
Indian the tomahawk is the emblem of war itself. To bury it is peace, 
to raise it is the most deadly warfare." *

POTTERY PIPE. 

Chautauqua, New York. 

Cat. No. 22165, U.S.N.M. Collected by 
• L. M. Dwight. 



The Iroquoian pipes present many unusnal cliaracteri sties and evi- 
dence strong local influences exceeded by none on the continent unless 
it be the curved base mound pipes of Ohio. Fig. Ill is a homely form 
of pipe of the Iroquoian area, made of an extremely hard-burned dark 
pottery, containing no visible mixture of tempering material such as is 
commonly found in aboriginal earthenware 
vessels. This pipe was found in Chautau- 
qua County, New York, collected by Mr. 
L. M. Dwight, and is very similar to mod- 
ern Pueblo specimens, both in its bowl and 
stem cavities. It is but 2h inches long and 
an inch wide, the walls of the bowl being 
so thick as to leave the opening only lialf 
an inch wide, the stem being brought to a 
point with an opening scarcely an eighth 
of an inch in diameter, made apparently as 
are the Pueblo pipes by inserting a stem 
of grass in the fresh clay and burning it out in the process of roasting 
the pipe. This specimen is entirely Mithout ornament, and the writer 
would be inclined to believe that it belonged rather to the Indians of 
New Mexico than to New York, were it not that the material of Iro- 
quoian pipes is quite often of this hard- 
burned earthenware. The Iroquoian inpe 
has a smaller stem opening than those of the 
Atlantic coast people generally. 

Iroquoian pipes are not uncommonly 
found with flaring-topped bowls, such as 
that in fig. 112, which is a pottery specimen 
collected by Dr. F. B. Hough at EUisburg, 
New York. It has a typical bronze hunting- 
horn shape, such as could be found among 
the primitive implements of Scandinavia or 
the rest of Europe. It may, be argued that 
either of these two pipes would answer 
(;artier's description of a " Cornet." A some- 
what similar pipe is herein illustrated (fig. 
220) from Tennessee. In either of these the 
form of the musical instrument is copied. 
In almost every j)ipe of the Iroquoian area 
may be traced forms distinctly copied from 
European sources. 
Eev. W. M. Beauchamp refers the Avriter to a pipe of this type from 
Onondaga County, New Y^ork, made from a brownish-yellow stone, on 
the bowl of which there is a human face facing toward the smoker, and 
to another clay pipe from Cayuga County, in which the bowl and stem 
are almost in the same plane, the curve being graceful from one end of

tbe pipe to the other. Mr. G. H. Perkins ilhistrates, from the Cham- 
phiiu Valley in Vermont, ajiipe of this character made of earthenware, 
upon the surface of which and partially encircling the center of the 
pipe, are a number of depressions similar to such as are observed upon 
the Iro(pioian limestone rectangular i)ipes. The more archaic speci- 
mens of this type will be found to approach quite closely the straight 
tube form. Several with but slight curves to them have been found in 
Cayuga, Onondaga, and Montgomery counties, New York, with mark- 
ings and other characteristics peculiar to the Iroquoian pipe, some 
having no ornamentation, others, only ornamentation of the simplest 
character, until finally we see the human face in great elaboration. 

A gracefully curved pottery pipe, with an ornamentally shaped bowl 
(fig. 1 13), is from Fremont, Sandusky County, Ohio, and was collected by 
L. Lappman. This place is near the head of steamboat navigation on the 
Sandusky River. This type is referred to by Squier as being found on 

the site of an old Seneca town in Liv- 
ingston County, Kew York.^ The 
enlarged bowl is encircled with six in- 
cised lines made as if in imitation of 
cord marks, and at the jioint where the 
slight shoulder and smaller part of the 
bowl join are ten nearly equidistant 
notches cut into the pottery. They 
are apparently for ornamentation. 
Morgan refers to the art of making

imens being so firm as to have the 
appearance of stone. In some specimens, he remarks, they have in 
front a human face or the head of a wolf or that of a dog. Of late, 
he says, the Iroquois cut pii)es out of soapstone.^ 

Many of the specimens of Iroquoian clay pipes in the U. S. National 
Museum are broken. Those which come under the general designation 
of "trumpet shaped," vary greatly in the curve of the outlines of their 
bowls, the exteriors of some being round, others square, at other times 
the sides flare or curl over until they resemble a trumpet. The exterior 
ornamentation varies as greatly as does the shape of the bowl itself, 
parallel lines running horizontally, perpendicularly, and diagonally, 
are constantly encountered and it is not uncommon to find the lines of 
ornamentation consisting of graceful combinations running in parallel 
lines or blocks, which, however, seldom or never cross each other, due 
to some superstition, possibly, in connection therewith. This type is

found in the Mohawk Valley. Serpent bowls are said by Rev. W. M. 
Beau«;hauip to be frequent, and he says the Oneidas were foud of owl's 
heads, and that sometimes an animal's head was placed above a man's. 
J\Ir. E. H. Squier illustrates a day pipe from 
Jefl'erson County, New York, apparently be- 
longing to this class, around the bowl of which 
two snakes are wrapped iu graceful folds, 
though they do not cross each other. At 
times there is noted in their bowls a graceful 
barrel-shaped enlargement, similar iu general 
characteristics to some ol the early E 
trade pipes. The 
same enlarge- 
ment of the bowl 
is also noted 
commonly in the 
vase- shaped 
bowls of i)ipes 
intended to be 
smoked without 
stems. The flar- 
ing bowls are frequently found at Montreal. Mr. Beauchamp calls 
attention to quite a remarkable clay pipe found in Onondaga County, 
New York, upon the bowl and stem of which there 
yet remain fourteen human faces; the stem of this 
is partly broken off. There are indications that the 
faces originally extended to the end of the stem. 
Mr. Beauchamp has furnished the writer sketches 
of pipes that are in his i^ossessiou from 
both Cayuga and Onondaga counties, 
New York, Avhich are strikingly graceful 
as works of art, especially those rex)re- 
senting birds' heads, one of which appears 
to be a wild pigeon (fig. 114). Another

cates similar art environments and concepts, which are only reconciled 
bj' attributing- them to French or English origin. The character of these 
pi{)es ditters between Korth and South sufficiently to entitle each to 
be classed by itself. There are others of these i)ipes having upon their 
bowls the heads of animals, differently treated but all of a highly artistic 
character. These heads commonly face the smoker, but one, represent- 
ing a panther, laces to the right side. What adds greatly to the artistic 
eflect of this class of pipes is that in addition to the head represented 
there is a grouping of incised lines, dots, or ellipsoidal depressions, 
one or other, or a combination of the three, which have a most pleasing 
effect. Mr. David Boyle, in his Notes on Primitive Man in Ontario, for 
1895, has given a number of illustrations of these Iroquoian pipes of 
c]a3^ and calls attention to the square-topped class, which he attributes 
to the Hurons "on account of its prevalence in the district occupied by 
those people." ' 

Many of the pipes illustrated by Mr. Boyle represent the human faces 
with anything but Indian characteristics ; one, apparently that of a 
woman, is facing the smoker. A second, very similar one, faces from 
the smoker. A curious specimen illustrated by Mr. Boyle looks like 
some animal with a bit in its mouth. Two of his illustrations of the 
pipes of Ontario represent the snake, one being open-mouthed, and in 
the second, two twined snakes form the bowl. Mr. Boyle considers that 
there is no evidence that totemism played any part in this department 
of aboriginal handicraft, and thinks the great variety of human repre- 
sentations would seem to indicate the mere play of fancy in ]}i])e mod- 
eling. In some instances he thinks there may have been a secondary 
reference to totems^ referring, of course, to Iroquoian types. 

Mr. Boyle's recent illustrations of the Iroquoian pipe suggest that 
the variety of animal forms and human heads and faces was almost 
endless, though the variety itself is one of the strongest arguments in 
favor of the European origin and treatment of the pipe. He speaks of 
great pits of bones containing at times as many as a thousand indi- 
viduals, being "without an arrowhead, without a pipe, without a pot, 
or without a scrap of anything to cheer the forlorn ghosts."^ He also 
says, in a communication to the writer, that in the oldest graves he had 
ever opened no pipes appeared, and it is believed that the more care- 
fully the subject is studied the more proof will be found that this type 
of pipe with elaborate forms modeled upon it dated from late in the 
seventeenth if not the eighteenth century. 

In the etomology of the word "Iroquois" Mr. Hale finds what he 
believes to be at least a possible origin in the indeterminate form of the

All ejitremely hard burned pottery pipe from Massacliusetts, colle(;ted 
by Mr. J. H. Deverenx, is shown in fig. IIU, which evidences a certain 
relationship to the last illustration, not only in the material from which 
it is made, but in the partially encircling lines and a row of notches 
around the shoulder of the bowl Mhere the lines stop, and also in the 
character of the bowl, stem, and the curve of the pipe. This specimen 
is about 2i inches in height and would if whole be about i inches long, 
the diameter of bowl being generally abont an inch. A remarkable 
featnre of this pipe is the hnman ligare on the escntcheon or niche facing 
the smoker, which is a part of the bowl, this being" an occurrence not 
nnnsual in pipes found throughout an 
extensive territory bordering" on the St. 
Lawrence. The figure, which is seated, 
appears to have been stamped in the 
cla}^ prior to burning, though a nnmber 
of notches seem to have been cut around 
the outer frame encircling the figure after 
the clay was baked. One can scarcely 
ignore in this pipe the strong resem- 
blance it bears to the pictures and wood 
carvings of the whites in their churches 
and elsewhere, the elevation of the rim 
being strongly indicative of the front of 
the hat of the grenadier. 

Rev. W. M. Beauchamp, of Baldwins- 
ville, Xew York, has several examples 
of this character, found in Jefferson 
County, New York. The lines com mouly 
encircling the escutcheon are two or 
three. Mr. David Boyle, of Ontario, finds that the figures usually have 
the left hand raised to the mouth, the figures themselves being of half 
or full length, seated or standing. 

There are, however, other pottery pipes of the Iroquoian type in 
which the bowls and stems are almost at right angles to each other 
and made of stone, that Pierre a Calumet to which Kalm refers in 
1749, saying: 

'•This is the French name of a stone disposed in strata between the 
lime slate, and of which they make almost all of the tobacco pi])e heads 
in the country. When the stone is long exposed to the open air or 
heat of the sun it gets a yellow color, but in the inside it is gray. It 
is a limestone of such compactness that its particles are not dis- 
tinguishable to the naked eye. It is pretty soft and will bear cnt-

ting witli a knife. All the tobacco pipe heads which the common 
people iu Canada make use of are made of this stone, and are orna- 
mented in different ways. A great part of the gentry likewise make 
use of them, especially when they are on a journey. The Indians have 
employed this stone for the same purposes for several ages past and 
have taught it the Europeans. The heads of the tobacco pipes are 
naturally of a pale gray color, but they are blackened while they are 
quite new to make them look better. They cover the head all over 
with grease and hold it over a burning candle or any other fire, by 
which means it gets a good black color, which is increased by frequent 
use. The tubes of the pipes are always made of wood." ' 

This stone is found near the Falls of Montmorency, 9 miles below 
Quebec. In other ways than in the use of the pipe stone "the French 
in Canada in many respects follow the customs of the Indians. They 
make use of the tobacco pipes; they mix the same things with tobacco; 
most of them wear red Avoolen caps at home and some- 
times on their Journeys." ^

instance is at full length, and in- 
stead of being in relief, as in the pottery specimen, is in intaglio, though 
it is inclosed in a somewhat similar framework, which has two equi- 
distant lines running up each side of the bowl and continuing from one 
side of the face to the other across the top above the standing figure. 
Around the upper part of the bowl are a number of ellipsoidal counter- 
sunk depressions of irregular sizes, some of which are square or in shape 
of a parallelogram with rounded corners, the interior of the depressions 
not being smoothed, but showing the tool marks left by the implement 
with which the material was removed. These depressions are among 
the most striking characteristics of Iroquoian pipes of all shapes, and 
one of the marks most often encountered in pipes of the area influenced 
by the Iroquoian Confederacy. 

The Rev. W. M. Beauchamp has in his collection "a dark marble 
pipe" of this character from Onondaga County, New York, with the 
same frontal elevation observed in the illustration, though the orna- 
mentation on the side of the bowl away from the smoker differs. Prof. 
G. II. Perkins illustrates a similar pipe from the Champlain Valley,

whicli is made Iroiii clouded gypsum. The depressions upon the sur- 
face, he believes, were intended to be inlaid with pieces of other stone, 
and considers that there can be no doubt of this because of the unfinished 
state in which these cavities are left, whereas tlie rest of the pii)e is 
moderately well tinished. Several similar pii)es are said to have been 
found on both sides of the lake.' An excellent specimen of this type 
from Cortland County, Xew York, is in the Douglass collection. 

A cast of a pipe of this class from Montreal shows the human face 
so grotescpiely as to represent the front of the skull with its eye- 
less sockets and cavities, intended for nose and mouth rather than a 
living face, not only on that part of the bowl facing the smoker, but on 
its sides as well. Professor Perkins also illustrates a pipe bowl with 
several of these elliptical or quadrangular depressions excavated, as he 
thinks, for the purpose of being tilled in with ornamental bits of shell 
or stone. The bowl of the latter has no stem 
attached an<I was apparently intended for smok- 
ing with a stem.^ 

IJowlsof other shapes have been found in New 
York with these peculiar depressions cut into 
their surfaces, and Professor Perkins illus- 
trates a pipe of the rectangular type made of 
pewter, which probably represented, as he 
suggests, the transition stage of stone from 
pottery. 

The pipes do not fully answer Kalm's descrip- 
tion in their stems, and of the known speci- "^^^^^ Fig. iis.

molded a human face, exhibits apparently European rather than Indian 
characteristics, and preserves in the shape of the bowl the peculiarities 
of the "grenadier hat" form, the usual elevation of the bowl being 
moditied in order the more effectually to allow the modeling of the 
forehead. In the ornamentation of the bowl of this pipe, especially that 
part of it behind the individual's ear, a number of broad and narrow lines 
alternating with each other with rows of dots between them are artis- 
tically grouped. The ears are distinctly formed and fairly well modeled, 
and the eyes have been deeply cut into the pottery subsequent to its

buruiiig-, as tliongh intended to bold artificial pupils of some different 
material — a not unknown art in American pipes, especially tbose of the 
curved base mound type. Tbe moutb is sawed into tbe pottery, and not 
modeled in its ])lastic condition, as are tlie otber features. This type 
bas also been found in Cayuga and Mnnroe counties, New York. 

A well-burned pottery pipe of Iroquoian type (fig. 119) from Water- 
town, Kew York, collected by Col. E. Jewett, shows a rude character 
of unusual ornamentation, not only in its scalloped bowl, but in the 
enlarged part of tbe same, decorated by lines cut into tbe pottery, 
thougb type cbaracteristics are preserved. Pipes of this character are 
f(mnd in a variety of forms, having at times molded on the bowl or 
around it, or on top of it, the ligures of men or animals, including both 
the grave and grotescjue, yet often they are executi d witb a degree of 

skill more nearly akin to tbe 
higher European art than to 
tbat of savages, who, unless 
they did so in their pipes, 
do not appear to have pro- 
duced a single figure carved 
in the round, except of the 
rudest character. 

Pipes of this type, having 
square tops to the bowls, be- 
long to the Hurons, accord- 
ing to Mr. David Boyle, 
of Toronto, one of which, 
from Fox River of the Illi- 
nois, found in a mound in 
Wisconsin, is figured by him. These, Lapham says, were so small as 
to suggest that they were articles of fancy rather than of use.' 

One of these square-topped pipes showing Iroquoian ornamentation 
was shown to Mr. H. R. Schoolcraft by a chief of Riviere An Sable, at 
Thunder Bay, INIichigau, on tlie mainland, as an antique pipe, which 
the chief averred was smoked by his ancestors.'-' Dawson illustrates 
a similar specimen from Montreal. 

School ciaft is i)robably right in his assertion that though they were 
attributed to the skill of the American Indians they were not in any 
instance due to these tribes, but were made for the Indian trade.^ 

This v/ill probably apply with equal force to all these hard-burned 
clay pipes of Iroquoian type having upon them such varied ornamen- 
tation as the representations of men, birds, and animals.

Falls, Monroe County, New York, collected by Mr. William M. Locke. 
It is quite small, and shows in what a variety of ornamentation the peo- 
ple making these pipes indulged. Though the animal is not sufficiently 
well modeled to distinguish whether a mouse or a fox, the eyes, ears, 
and legs are attached to a rude modeling, indicating a tyi)e of art dif- 
ferent from what would be expected of a people living in the purest 
savage state, as the Indians of this region did 
at the time of first contact with Europeans. 

Squier and Davis illustrate an Iroquoian pot- 
tery pipe plowed up in West Virginia, nearly 
op])osite the mouth of the Hocking liiver, where 
there are abundant traces of an ancient people 
in the form of mounds, embankments, etc.;' on 
the bowl there is an animal's head which faces 
from the smoker, and which, judging from the 
illustration, belongs to the Iroijuoian type, not 
only in shajje, but in ornamentation of the bowl 
as well. While this latter pipe is from a local- 
ity quite distant from where similar ones are 
commonly found, it is within the area intluenced 
to a certain extent by French trade. 

On the bowl of one of these pottery pipes was 
modeled a panther's head facing to the right. 

Others have been found with heads facing from the smoker, and a 
singular specimen was discovered representing the caricature of a hu- 
man head and face, the mouth of which is drawn to one side, the eyes 
closed, and the side of one jaw badly swollen as if from toothache.

BIRD PIPES. 

A curious pipe of pronounced type (fig. 121) was found in a mound 
on the banks of the Ohio River in Allegheny County, rennsylvania, 
and collected by Mr. P. Painter, which has an outline that would indicate 
a bird sitting upon a perch or limb. It is 5i inches high and appears 
to be made of a compact black slate, which has been badly cracked 
by other heat than that generated in smoking it. The eyes are repre- 
sented by two depressions, the feet by a knob, and, except that the 
head has been shaped, the rest of the body is perfectly smooth, and in 
cross section a parallelogram. The only tool marks visible are appar- 
ently those of a file across the top of the bowl. Pipes of this type 
had, as a matter of course, to be smoked with a wooden or other 
stem. The feet of the bird in these pipes are at times perforated 
for the attachment of a cord, or the knob is sufficiently shouldered to 
answer the same purpose, the bowl and stem openings being of like 
size, and drilled each one-half inch in diameter. One of these pipes 
(Cat. ifo. 32297, U.S.N.M.) was found in Onondaga County, New York.

Tlie feathers of the bird are rudely indicated, and around the neck 
there is a neckhice of beads carved into the stone. Mr. Boyle refers 
the writer to another pipe of this type in form of a dog or monkey, 
which was found in Ontario, having a hole for the string bored through 
the base of the figure. A pipe of similar type in possession of Rev. 
W. M. Beauchamp, from Oneida lliver, New York, represents a bird 
with topknot or comb, the wings being indicated by incised lines, the 
material of the pipe being black slate. A specimen in the collection 
of Mr. O. M. IJigelow, made also of slate, has what appears to be 
wings cut in regular conventional lines, though the 
head may as well be called a turtle as a bird. The 
feet of the last two pipes referred to are bored from 
side to side; upon the first there is on the back of the 
neck a heart-shaped ornament. Still another of these 
bird pipes from Onondaga County, New York, has 
upon its sides the ellipsoidal depressions so often 
noticed in Iroquoian pottery and stone pipes. Mr. 
Beauchamp suggests that these pipes were made with 
metallic tools. There is also in the U. S. National 
Museum collection (Cat. No. 32342) a cast of a most 
curious pipe of this type, the original of which is said 
to be of magnesian limestone, in shape of a dog, and is 
from New York, though the figure is so carved that it 
is possible the intention was to represent the skeleton 
of some animal. A beautifully executed pipe of this 
character, having all the characteristics of the north- 
ern specimens, made from a light brown, highly-pol- 
ished stone, and upon which the wing and tail feathers 
are conventionally represented, is in the collection of 
the University of Pennsylvania, and is said to be from the coast of 
Florida, which is, however, so far from the known locality where these 
pipes are usually found as to suggest its having been lost by some white 
person who had obtained it in the north. 

Yet another pipe, apparently of this type, was found at North Carver, 
Plymouth County, Massachusetts, and is illustrated by l)r. Charles C. 
Abbott.' 

This i)ipe has been attributed to tlie people of the Pacific coast, and 
is sui)posed to have been brought across the continent. Its character 
istics and style of workmanship are strikingly like those of certain of 
the Pacific coast tribes, though if the specimen be compared with 
others of the type, there is scarcely room to (piestion its eastern 
northern origin. 

Mr. David Boyle illustratses a slate specimen from Victoria County, 
Ontario, with a well-carved beak and mouth; though by far the most 
curious pipes of this type are two illustrated by Mr. Boyle, from Victo-

rig. 1-2, from Erie Countj', Pennsylvania, collected by Mr. J. H. Dev- 
ereux, is 5 inches iu height and is clearly of this type, being made of a 
very imperfectly crystallized quartzite, the surface of which is so rough 
that it would be impossible to represent eyes or feathers, no matter 
what tools were employed, the bowl and stem holes being of the same 
size, namely, one-half inch, which is a striking feature of pijies of this 
type. The localities where they are found, with the one exception 
noted, are all contiguous to the St. Lawrence, the line of the Great 
Lakes, and their tributaries — all well within that of Iroquoian ethnic 
relationship — yet with all this in favor of their aboriginal origin, there 
is a very general belief iu their being of European 
manufacture, or at least made with the implements 
of the European. 

In an examination of the English trade pipe, both 
in Europe and America, there is found such similarity 
to American forms as to leave little room to doubt 
that there is suflicient likeness between the two to 
establish a common origin. The writer is, however, 
inclined to credit the origin of the type to the Eng- 
lish rather than to the native American, though the 
Dutch and French aj)pear early to have manufac- 
tured this pipe, and as some of the early French spec- 
imens are extremely archaic, it is possible that the 
Spanish may have employed it earlier than either. 
The readiness and cheapness with which Europeans 
were enabled to mold, burn, and sell the trade pipe 
caused it to l)e produced in great quantities, and the 
trader could alford to sell it at a price which brought 
it within the reach of all. When, in consequence of 
English cultivation, the colonists furnished an abundant supply of 
tobacco there was no longer difticulty in the Indian obtaining all that 
he wanted, for, notwithstanding the references to primitive cultivation 
by the natives, their fields appear to have been at best but insignificant 
in comparison to their actual requirements. 

The pipe of the French region of infiuence along the banks of the 
St, Lawrence Kiver differed from that of the territory dominated by 
the English to the east and south of them, the French pipe, as a rule, 
being more elaborate than that of their rivals in trade. They are more 
graceful in form and more artistic in design. The i)ipes of the French 
area of influence appear often to be trumpet shaped, though there are 
other types which have quite as distinct individuality and are scattered 
over a wide area. The calumet, now everywhere known also as the 
"peace pipe," apparently derives its name from the chalitmeait, a musical

instrument on the order of tlie flageolet, called by the lOnolish "chalmy." 
This instrument in turn obtains its name from the same Xorman word, 
sig'uifjang a reed. 

Tlie long voyages from Europe to America during the sixteenth and 
seventeenth centuries must have been mcmotonous in the extreme until 
the navigators fell in with the land, and even as early as the time of 
Cicero he informs ns there was not a vessel where music was not 
em[)loyed on shi^jboard to relieve the monotony of the voyage.' 

Instrumental music was as astonishing to the natives as was the noise 
of the guns, and must have afforded to these children of the forest 
renuirkable entertainment as well as great astonishment. Nothing is 
more natural than that the original tubular pipe should have been 
gi\en the flaring mouth of the metal horn of the French, which, as a 
pipe, would be further improved by imitating the curve of the horn. 

A sort of flageolet referred to by Sir John Ilawkiiis was a musical 
instrument of which, in an account of Queen Elizabeth's annual 
expense published by Peck in his Disiderata Curiosa, he speaks of as 
being " filled with air blown into them by the mouth." He alludes to 
several of them by name, especially the chalmy, i. e., the Chalujneau.- 

The illustration given by Hawkins is that of a straight instrument, 
similar to a flageolet and having a flaring mouth like fig. 112. 

According to McCulloh,the calumet "which is a Norman word signify- 
ing a reed, is a tobacco pipe whose stem is about 4 feet in length, some- 
times round and at other times flat. It is painted and adorned witli 
hair, porcupine quills, dyed of various colors, and the most beautiful 
feathers that can be procured. The bowl of the pipe is most fre- 
quently red marble, though some tribes only admit of white stone, 
and if it be j^resented to them either of black or red color will have it 
whitened before they smoke it. It is considered a sacred or consecrated 
object, and on this account is never suffered to touch the ground, 
being laid upon two forked sticks, stuck upright in the earth for that 
purpose." ^ 

CALUMET AND WAMPUM. 

The illustration here given (fig. 123) shows the calumet with all of 
its ornamentation as used by the Omahas. To dance the calumet "is 
to make a sacred kinshi]), which is done after serious consultation in 
which the party selected is sometimes advised againstdoing so, because 
the i)arty to be danced for is either not worthy of it or he may himself 
refuse to be adopted in the dance. If all is agreeable, all parties repair 
to a particular place, where the pijies are i)laced on a forked support. 
Instead of the pipe bowl there is the head of a green-necked duck; 
on the ui)i)er side of the stem are yellowish feathers of the great owl ;

next long- win,g- feathers of tlie great war eagle, split and stuck on lon- 
gitudinally in three places, as on an arrow shaft. At the end of these is 
some horsehair which has been reddened. 
It is wrapped on the stem and tied on with 
sinew and over that is fastened some of 
the fur of the white rabbit; near one end 
is the head of a woodcock * * * the nose 
turned toward the mouthpiece. Ou the 
])ipe the eagle feathers are white, being 
those of a male eagle, and the pipe stem 
is dark blue." ' 

As seen in tig. 124, "When the pipes are 
rested against the forked stick the head 
of the duck is placed next the ground. 
The sticks are colored with Indian red. 
The next morning before sunrise some of 
the visitors sing for the people to arise and 
assemble. When they begin to sing, the 
pipes are taken from their support and are 
not returned until the singing is concluded. 
They sing again after breakfast, a third 
time in the afternoon, and once more at 
night. This generally continues for two 
days, during which time the visitors are 
feasted. Sometimes they continue the feast 
for three days. The day after the feast 
they give and receive presents. The next 
day a servant of one of the iDrincipal visi- 
tors is selected to dance, one who is skillful 
in imitating the movements of the war 
eagle. The x)erson danced for is thereafter 
adopted as a member of the family of the 
other. The Ponkas are not fully acquaint- 
ed with the calumet dance. They use but 
one pipe;, but the Omahas always have two 
pil)es."'^ This description of the dance and 
of the pipe and the decorations of the pipe 
are similar to the earliest accounts we 
have. The stem of a pipe brought from the 
Lower Niger, Africa, by Captain Burton, which is in the collection of 
the British Museum, with its carefully attached tufts, resembles stems 
employed by American Indians.^

The friendly offering- of the pipe is evidently an nncient cnstoiu, and 
one referred to by many of the earliest visitors to the Atlantic Coast, 
though in council the pipe does not appear to have been so prominent 
an adjunct in the East as it was in the Valley of the Mississippi, where in 
all functions between the French and the natives the calumet occupied 
an important position.

Except by means of the rudest pictography the North American 
native had no means of recording events. Some method became neces- 
sary in tlieir dealings, particularly with the whites, to evidence engage- 
ments on the one part and the other, whether affecting the tribe, as in 
treaties, or between individuals, as in simple contracts, memory alone 
being too unreliable without extraneous symbols. Among the English, 
in their early dealings, the "wampum belt" or necklace, consisting

originally of beads of wood or shell, and later of bands of shell, and 
still later of china or glass beads worked into bands, or belts, as they 
were commonly called, arranged in rude order, were employed, a sim- 
ple example of A\hich, represented in fig. 125, after Eev. W. M. 
Beauchamp, is formed of "white beads on a dark background." The 
long house represents the Five Nations, and the cross the French.^ 

The design of this belt, which appears to have succeeded the string 
of wampum, varied according to the occasion, and was intended to 
remind those presenting it, as well as those who received it, of what was 
agreed upon at the time of its presentation or exchange. Instead of 
the belt the French, from the earliest period of their intercourse with 
the natives, adopted the pipe ceremony in council, as well as in their 
trading, in which invariably the pipe had to be smoked before any 
serious business could be undertaken. In the early French records there 
is abundant evidence that the pipe was considered as similar to the flag 
of truce, and protected its bearer under ail circumstances. Later the 
pipe and belt of wampum, especially with the great Iroquoian Confeder- 
acy of the Five and later the Six iSTations, appear to have been employed 
in conjunction with e?^ch other. When the English were holding a

council with the natives the belt was most important, whereas if the 
deliberations were with the French it was the pipe that was most sig- 
nificant. Still later the Americans appear to have supplanted the pipe 
of the French with the American flag, or more often with medals stamped 
with the head of the President of the United States. Prior to the 
advent of the whites some interchange of commodities in the way of 
trade ai)pears to have existed between the natives. Even during times 
of hostility the trader has been allowed to travel back and forth with 
his articles of exchange with little danger. The religious sentiment 
was of the crudest character among the Indians, and was little, if at all, 
superior to the fetish worship of the Africlin. Hunger, climate, and 
variation of seasons necessitated constant movement in search of game, 
fish, and peltries, for the Indian had learned but the rudiments of the 
cultivation of soil. Expert as a hunter, able to track his prey, whether 
man or beast, with an accuracy surprising to the whites, he was not a 
herdsman. He migrated with the buffalo. Agriculture was almost an 
unknown art to him. His boundaries were only limited by the presence 
in a given area of a more powerful neighbor who was ever ready and 
anxious to resent a trespass on his territory or the slaughter of his game.

508 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

"The name 'calumet' pipes has been given," according to Dr. Rau, 
"to large stone pipes, which were smoked with a stem, and are usually 
fashioned in imitation of a bird, mammal, or amphibian, and sometimes 
of the human ligure. They were thus called on account of their bulk, 
which seemed to indicate their character as pipes of ceremony to be 
used on solemn occasions. It was further thought that these pipes had 
not been the property of individuals, but of communities, a view which 
does not seem altogether correct, since some have been discovered in 
burial mounds accompanying a single individual." ' 

This word has been so extensively used, first by the French and sub- 
secpiently by the English, that, whatever its original meaning, it may 
be said that at present it signifies merely a pipe. There were calumets 
of war, of peace, of the dance, of confederacy, of the clan, of the cult, 
and of the individual. To-day a red Siouan catlinite rectangular pipe 
would more correctly represent a calumet than any other single type. 
Pipes were of many different sizes and of different shapes with each 
aftiliated tribe, the larger ones usually being employed when the inter- 
ests of tribe or confederacy were involved, whereas the straight tube 
appears to be the pi])e of the dance and solemn sacred functions. 

The calumet of peace, according to the French missionaries, was 
accepted as a flag of truce by the Indians from Lake Michigan far down 
the Mississippi III ver from IC 73 for many decades. According to Morgan, 
"the Iroquois believed that tobacco was given to them as the means 
of communication with the spiritual world. By burning it they could 
send up their petitions with its ascending incense to the Great Spirit, 
and render their acknowledgments acceptably for His blessings."^ 

At the sacrifice of the white dog among the Sioux the speaker "threw 
leaves of tobacco into the fire from time to time, that its incense might 
constantly ascend during the whole of the address."^ 

The pipe among the Indians of Canada, as elsewhere, was used also 
upon ordinary social occasions, though there is reason to believe that 
the pipe ceremony always had some special significance other than that 
of a mere social acknowledgment or sedative. It brought luck or kept 
away evil spirits. It was smoked to bring game, or keep ofl' disease, 
and to attract or repel the mysterious powers of their mythology. 
Among the Mandans, "if a woman passes between several men ot the 
tribe who are smoking together, it is a bad omen. Should a woman 
recline on the ground between men who are smoking, a piece of wood 
is laid across her to serve as a communication between the men. When 
any person had a i)ainful or diseased place, a man put his pipe upon it 
and smoked. On such occasion he did not swallow the smoke, as is 
the Indian custom, but he affirmed he could extract the disease by his

smoking, and be pretended to seize it iu liis baud and tbrow it into tbe 
tire." ' 

Wberever tbere are accounts of early Spanish or French travels 
among tbe American Indians we find the cross played an important 
part. The Spanish upon entering a town or village invariably erected 
a cross the first thing they did. Tbe French missionaries, besides car- 
rying prominently the cross as a jiart of their visible C(iuii)ment, did 
their best to impress upon the natives its great importance. Conse- 
quently we tind it prominent among aboriginal decorations; it is seen 
on the wampum belt, upon inscribed shells, on pipes, etc. Cabeca de 
Vaca, in his wonderful adventures among the people of the territory 
then called Florida, cured the natives by making the sign of the cross. 
In a mound within the limits of Chillicothe was found, "in a small 
inclosure near by, a silver cross of French origin."- 

Upon another occasion "two silver crosses were taken in November, 
1839, from a grave mound at Ooosawattee, old town in ^lurray County, 
Georgia, associated with Indian implements,"' ' and other occurrences 
could be enumerated showing the contemporaneity of the crosses with 
pure savage conditions. 

"In a conference to make peace a single person is never sent; there 
must be two; but depending ur)on the strength of those conferring 
there may be fifteen or twenty. There is, however, one who delivers 
the strings and belts of wampum; the others listen to his words and 
remind him when he forgets something. One of the ambassadors car- 
ries the ])eace pipe in advance to the Indians — tbe same as a flag of 
truce is to the Europeans. The respect in which the embassy is held 
is so great that a person disregarding it would not fail to be punished 
by the Great Spirit. It is only used in negotiating treaties. This pipe, 
called calumet by the French, usually bad a head of red marble, the 
red color being the sign of blood. It is never sent as a peace offering 
without being covered with white clay or chalk. Such a pipe head is 
G to 8 inches wide and 3 inches high. The stem i^ of hard wood and 4 
feet long, covered with beautiful bandages interwoven with white coral, 
in which work the Indian women endeavor to show their skill. These 
stems are often ornamented with porcupine quills, or green, yellow, or 
white feathers. Near the village of tlie party opposed to them the 
envoys commence to sing and dance, and are carried to the dwelling of 
the head chief, where every attention is shown them so long as the 
negotiations last. The opening of the proceedings is performed by the 
head chief of the envoys taking a whiff from the peace pipe and blowing

to tlie skies and to tlie earth. It is then smoked iu successiou by the 
whole assembly, each person holding it with great care." ^ 

Among the Indian tribes generally only the more important chiefs 
are considered Avorthy of carrying the pipe of ceremony. " Among the 
Crees the calumet is borne by a man who is solemnly elected to the 
ofiice and who has to pay rather dearly for the honor, from 15 to 20 
horses being the usual iee which each pipe bearer i)resents to his 
predecessor on receiving the insignia of ofiice; these, however, are of 
considerable intrinsic value. They include a bearskin, on which the 
pipestem rests when uncovered; a beautiful painted skin tent, in which 
he is expected to reside; a medicine rattle of singular value; a food 
bowl, and other articles so numerous that two horses are needed to 
carry tliem."^ 

Among the Ojibways "nest in importance to the war chief was the 
pipe bearer, who oIKiciated in all public councils." ' 

On April 7, 153G, within one mile of Tadousac, below the mouth of the 
Saguenay, Lescarbot says: "Having landed, we went to the cabin of 
their sagamo, called Anedabijou, where we found him witli eighty or one 
hundred of his companions 'qui fasait tabagio,' whi(;h means feasting."^ 
He says this savage commenced to take petun (tobacco) " and gave it 
to the Sieur Du Pont and to me and to some other sagamos near him, 
and having taken a good smoke began his speech (id). From this time 
on the French advanced up the St. Lawrence, or Eiver of France, as 
they called it, until they reached Lake Ontario, and from thence to Erie, 
and each year went further as they became ac(iuainted with the Indians 
of the more distant parts until Marquette and Joliet, in 1673, reached 
the Mississippi near Lake Michigan. De Soto landed in Florida in 
May, 1539, and reached the banks of the Lower Mississippi in 1511. La 
Salle came into the mouth of the Mississippi in 1(382 and took posses 
sion in the name of the King of France. The Chevalier de Tonti had 
gone down the Mississippi Eiver as far as Balize in 1685 to meet La 
Salle, whom he missed. Iberville and Bienville, in 1690, entered the 
Mississippi and went up it as far as the mouth of the Ked Eiver and 
the next year met Tonti 50 miles from the mouth. He had come from 
Canada down the river, being the second trij) which he had made."^'

Ohio, where there have been discovered aboriginal remains of the most 
interesting character. The controversy as to the origin of these mounds 
and of the jjeople who built them and of their age is one most difficult 
of satisfactory solution. They are by no means confined to the United 
States, and as to whether the people who constructed them continued 
to do so up to a comparatively modern date or whether they are all of 
great antiquity is and has long been a matter of dispute. among archiie- 
ologists. The remains found in the mounds consequently have been 
by many attributed to a people of great antiquity, antedating the present 
Indian race, and many scientific papers have been written in support 
of this theory. Yet there are those living who have witnessed the 
building of mounds, and the extensive studies of Prof. Cyrus Thomas, 
of the Bureau of American Ethnology, induce him to believe that the 
Cherokees were mound-builders up to and since the arrival of the 
whites on the continent. Many articles of modern make, undoubtedly 
the handiwork of the white people, have been found buried in the 
mounds. Such things are declared by some to be intrusive or second- 
ary burials. They are alleged by others to have been deposited therein 
at the time of the construction of the tumuli. With hardly an excep- 
tion all earthworks of every description found in the interior of the 
country are attributed to this wonderful ancient race of aboriginees. 
Though the very country where mounds ^re most abundant was the 
battleground of French, English, and Indians for many decades in the 
struggles waged between the English and French for the possession of 
the Indian trade, some of these supposed aboriginal earthworks may 
well have been the fortified camps of one or other of the white invaders. 
The mounds are found almost invariabl}^ along the lines of the great 
rivers of the interior, due, presumably, to the fact that these rivers 
were the lines ot least resistance to the free communication from one 
point to the other, and consequently were the trade routes of the inte- 
rior, whether of white man or Indian. It has been said of the mound- 
builders that they were very numerous throughout the Mississippi 
Valley. "They were a people entirely distinct from the North Ameri- 
can Indian. The pipes are often elaborately and beautifully carved of 
a great variety of stones, generally of rather a soft character, and were 
apparently held in very high estimation, perhaps almost sacred. In 
the Upper Mississippi Valley they are of the same general type, having 
the flat curved base, which is perforated to serve as a stem. They 
represent a variety of forms, among them two said to distinctly repre- 
sent the elephant." ^ 

The best known work on the mound-builders' pipes is that of Messrs. 
E. G. Squier and E. H. Davis in the Ancient Monuments of the Mis- 
sissippi Valley, contained in the first volume of the Smithsonian Con- 
tributions to Knowledge, which described explorations of these remains

tlnougli a period of years. In this publicatiou there are illustrations 
of the objects discovered, and nothing is more striking than the i^ipes. 
These are quite numerous, and represent not only man, but many of 
the mammals, birds, and even reptiles, and, indeed, many of them are 
executed with skill and striking artistic eflect, though there may be 
room for doubt whether the figures represent as many diflerent species 
as some have believed. In intricacy of design, in artistic concept, in 
skill of execution, in truthfulness to nature, it must be admitted that 
the work of the modern Indian on his pipe, when compared with that 
of the mound-builder, would demonstrate that the historic Indian was 
the eijual of the supposed earlier race. There is no doubt whatever 
that pipe-carving constitutes the best examj)le of aboriginal art, though 
how far it was influenced by the whites is a question subject to difler- 
ence of opinion. In view of the fact, which is sustained by all writers, 
colonial and modern, that to the whole Indian race the pipe was an 
object used in religious functions, for medicinal puri)oses, in tribal 
treaties, as well as upon all social occasions, it is natural to see artistic 
influences developed in the pipe; this is more esi)ccially to be expected 
when we know that the totem of clan or tribe ranked as high as any- 
thing could in the Indian imagination. Yet it is quite another and 
more doubtful proposition to attribute to the Indian the amount of 
artistic skill evidenced in the forms of the mound pipes. These pipes 
are composed of stones, the stem holes being extremely small and per- 
fectly straight, and leave but little doubt that the x)ipes were smoked 
without a stem other than that comprised in the stone itself. It will 
be appreciated how numerous the totems of a tribe were when we com- 
pare the known clans among pueblo tribes with the figures represented 
npon the mound pipes, which were probably totemic. The animal 
kingdom represented among the totems of these people includes the 
ant, antelope, badger, bear, bluebird, bufl'alo, chaparal-cock, coyote, 
crane, crow, deer, dove, duck, eagle, frog, goose, gopher, hawk, hum- 
ming bird, lizard, martin, mole, mountain lion, parrot, snake, swallow, 
turkey, and wolf, not to mention the many totems representing inani- 
mate objects, such as arrows, axes, calabash, coral, corn, cottonwood, 
earth, feather, flower, grass, ivy oak, piiion, shell, stone, tobacco, and 
water willow.' 

The largest number of mound pipes ever discovered were found in a 
mound near Chillicothe, Ohio, by Squier and Davis, designated by them 
as Mound No. 8, where about two hundred were brought to light. This 
mound is small in size, and exhibits in its structure nothing remarkable. 

"The bowls of most of the pipes are carved in miniature figures of 
animals, birds, reptiles, etc. All of them are executed with strict fidel- 
ity to nature and with exquisite skill. The otter is shown in charac- 
teristic attitude, holding a fish in his mouth; the heron also holds a 
fish, the hawk grasps a small bird in its talons, which it tears with its

beak. The panther, the bear, the wolf, the beaver, the otter, the 
S(iairrel, the racooou, the hawk, the heron, crow, swaUow, buzzard, 
l)aroquet, toucan, and other indigenous and southern birds, the turth', 
the frog, toad, rattlesnake, etc., are recognized at first glance. But 
the most interesting and valuable in the list are a number of sculi)tured 
heads, no doubt faithfully representing the predominant physical fea- 
tures of the ancient people by whom they were made."' 

These views have been generally accepted since the publication of 
this great monograph, which represented tlie most extensive excavation 
undertaken by any archa-ologist up to its date, thougli other and more 
extensive investigations have since been made in these and in other 
mounds. The accepted theory has for a long period been that the 
American Indian lavished his utmost skill upon the construction and 
decoration of his pipe — those of stone as well as those of pottery. Of 
the latter. Sir John Lubbocli has remarked that, "Among the most 
characteristic specimens of ancient American pottery are the pipes. 
Many are spirited representations of animals, such as the beaver, 
otter, etc."'^ 

It does not appear to have been considered remarkable that the carv- 
ing of pipes with such great skill should be practically the only exam- 
ple of American Indian art; and it may be questioned if the small size 
of the pipes, thereby enabling them to be carried by their owners, suffi- 
ciently explains why pipes alone show this skill, fine carving being 
almost, if not entirely, unknown in other aboriginal stone objects from 
the area where these pipes are most often found. 

It may with pertinence be asked why do we not find in the mounds 
other images of stone finished with the skill of the mound pipe if 
they are of Indian origin? The religious or superstitious feeling of the 
seventeenth century would draw the line at idol making, whereas pipe 
manufacture would be a legitimate occupation. That the people of the 
minind-pipe region possessed idols is a historic fact, for Dablon, the 
Jesuit missionary (about 1G70-1672) at Fox Kiver, found an Indian idol 
on the bank similar to that which Dollier and Gallince found at Detroit, 
being merely a rock bearing some resemblance to a man and hideously 
painted ■ which they threw into the river; the rude ])OSsession of those 
people of whom Le Jeune said, in 1(533, " Unhappy infidels, who spend 
their life in smoke and their eternity in flames."^ 

Mound pi])es vary greatly in their finish, yet they are of a distinct type' 
from all other pipes, many of their bowl cavities being small in propor- 
tion to their exterior diameter; yet there are exceptions to the rule. 
The specimens u\ the Smithsonian collection vary in length from li to 5 
inches, in height from 1 to 2 inches, and in width from 1^ to 1.^ inches.

The bases of them all appear to curve longitiulinally ; the upper side of 
the iilatform composing the base usually presents a convex surface from 
side to side, though at times it is perfectly flat, or, rarely, it may be 
found showing a slightly concave surface. The simplest form of this 
pipe resemldes in outline that of the lip ornanient of the Eskimo, 
the bowl b'^ing urn-shaped, with a more or less pronounced flaring toj), 

which would indicate a probabU» 
ac(piaiiitance with pottery. The 
tops of the bowls and their exte 
rior rims are at times decorated 
with a row of dots, or it may be 
an encircling straight line or lines. 
The interiors of bowls are, with 
rare exceptions, of great uniform- 
ity, their exteriors varying from 
specimens with perfectly smooth 
surfaces to those in imitation of 
numerous members vf the animal 
kingdom, including man and the elephant. 

The most simple specimen of the typical mound pipe is seen in fig. 12G, 
found in a mound in Clark County, Ohio, collected by G. L. Febiger, 
United States Army, and is composed of a soft white stone — possibly 
limestone. It is 4 inches long, with a height of 2 inches, the base being 
IJ inches broad. The interior < f the bowl has a uniform diameter of 
seven eighths of an inch its 
whole depth, and appears to be 
bored by means of a tubular 
drill, though the stem seems to 
have been bored by means of a 
solid drill, the hole being one- 
eighth of an inch in diameter. 
These proportions are practi- 
cally constant in the mound 
pipes. Though this pipe has 
been badly broken, its several 
pieces have been jireserved and 
carefully glued in place. The 
specimen is typical and simple, 
entirely without ornament, its 
surface having been brought to 
a uniform smoothness, though the marks of a file on the bowl and stem 
are in places almost too distinct to be mistaken. These marks consist 
of a series of lines of equal length on apparently flat surfaces, all e(pii 
distant, which the writer has been unable to imitate in any way except 
by means of the metal file, various kinds of sandstone and quart/ite 
being tried with unsatisfactory results.

Mr. J. Vai'deu, is 2^ iiiclies long, with part of the base broken off. It 
is 1^ inches high and has a width of tliree-fourths of an inch. Thougli 
the base of this pipe is slightly more convex thau the preceding figure 
and the bowl more urn-shaped, the type remains the same, the bowl 
cavity being of uniform size its whole depth, though the stem hole is 
slightly in excess of that of the preceding figure. The walls of the 
bowl of this pipe are extremely thin, the bowl cavity being ellipsoidal, 
rather than cylindrical. The file marks on this pipe are also quite as 
distinct as they are on the preceding specimen. McLean illustrates a 
similar pipe as of the genuine mound-builder type.' 

There was also found in a mound in Laporte County, Indiana, one of 
the curved-base urn-bowled ijipes, and in the same mound with a single 
skeleton were two copi^er needles, a copper chisel, (our Hints, and some 
pottery. A very similar specimen is in the Davenport Academy of 
Sciences, which was found in Calhoun County, Illinois, and quite 
recently a very perfect specimen, made apparently of a mottled gray 
and white stone, was taken from a mound near Evart, Michigan, and 
is the property of Miss Helen A. Hepburn. 

Mr. John G. Henderson found a similar pipe in a mound at Naples, 
Illinois, near the Illinois lliver, made of a white stone, and from the 
same mound were taken two copper celts, one of which weighed 7^ 
pounds,^ and another is reported from Davenx)ort, Scott County, Iowa.' 

Mr. Warren K. Morehead excavated an unfinished catlinite pipe of 
this' type with the curved base characteristics at Fort Ancient, Ohio, 
which shows distinctly the process of manufacturing indurated clay 
pipes, which was by pecking or battering the stone with a stone 
hammer, as was demonstrably the process of working those stones not 
readily shaped by chipping.* One was taken from a mound at Tools- 
boro, Louisa County, Iowa, made of " a soft whitish stone,"'' and yet 
another unfinished specimen is in the U. S. National Museum (Cat. No. 
58650) from Sauk County, Wisconsin, which adds materially to our 
knowledge of the process of manufacturing these pipes, the surface 
being apparently ground with sand, or a sandstone, as is evidenced by 
the stria; left by the tool, which are yet discernible. The bowl of this 
pipe has, however, been excavated by a solid drill used with sand. 
The base is broken in process of manufacture, owing to which the bowl 
has been finished less than the necessary depth, which accounts for its 
being discarded. The base also is fiat, though such specimens are not 
unusual, Mr. Gerard Fowke having found one in a mound in Page 
County, Virginia.'^ Moorehead records one from the Hopewell group 
of mounds in Ohio.'

mound pipes many are found the bowls of which are spool-shaped on

The fact of these pipes being buried with liuman bodies has been 
thought to i^rove that they were invested with religious significance, 
Ihongh the same argument would e(iually apply to the many other 
objects Ibund in aboriginal graves, which were the usual receptacles of 
the possessiojis of the dead — a custom by no means contiued to 
America and applies to most countries with eqnal Ibrce. In mound

much broken up, some of them calcined by the heat, which had been 
sufficiently strong to melt copper."'' 

The figui-es of some of ihese pipes of animal form ai)pear to have had 
artificial eyes, most of which were destroyed by fire; a pearl, however, 
which formed the eye of one, yet remains.'' 

A similar occurrence is noted of a bird pipe made of pii)e stone found 
in a mound at Toolsboro, Iowa, with pearl eyes.' 

Pearls are found in some of the unios of the Mississippi. These 
pipes were originally supposed to be very hard and of a porj)hyritic 
character, but upon investigation were discovered to be either a sili- 
ceous clay slate, an argillaceous ironstone, a pearly l)rown ferruginous 
chlorite, calcareous marl, or maily limestone.'' 

In the collection of the American Museum of Natural History in New 
York City there are twelve or thirteen si:)ecimeus and fragments of the 
Squier and Davis pipes from Mound City, (3hio. Mr. A. E. Douglass also 
has two very perfect ones of the Squier and Davis find. There is in these 
collections enough material to demonstrate that the technical work on 
these curved base pipes, which have caused so much wonder for the 
last forty years, is of a very sui)erior order. The artistic skill of those 
making them is evidenced in eveiy line of the i)ipes and of their 
ornamentation. The bowls have been perforated by means of hollow 
metal drill points and the small stem holes by solid points; the scales 
on the frogs and the feathers of the birds are cut with an accuracy and

delicacy of detail in thiu, sharp lines which appears to indicate the use 
ol .shari)-pointed tools. The head of au Indian, the bowl of which is 
drilled from the top of the head down by means of a thiu tubular drill, 
the platform beint;- broken oft'ou both sides, is a well executed likeness 
of au American Indian, while certain incised lines upon his face are prob- 
ably intended to represent the lines of i^aiut or tattooing. These lines 
are cut in sharply and deeply, and it is an artistic production. A few 
of the surface lines of this pipe have first been incised and subsequently 
partially obliterated by grinding or polishing, but yet remains sufiQ- 
ciently clear to suggest the use of the steel tile. The Avhole effect of 
this head is calculated to impress one who carefully examines it with 
the idea that it is the work of a skillful European carver. 

One of these specimens in the Museum of Xatural Uistory is a 
curved base pipe having upou the convexity of the base an animal in 
a sitting or squatting position, but whether bear, wolf, dog, or mouse 
it would be impossible to say. The perforation for the eyes goes from 
side to side, and there can be little doubt it was intended to insert 
artificial eyea of some sort. A peculiarity of this specimen is that 
below the eyes there are two small holes bored, one on each side of the 
upper part of the foce, that are so small, indeed, and sharply cut as to 
indicate the employment of a steel point as fine as a fine needle. A 
splinter of stone could not have made the hole, a point of native copj)er 
wire could scarcely do it, the small size and clear cutting being prob- 
ably owing to an implement of European manufacture. There are four 
or five of what have been and are supposed to be file marks upon the 
top of the head of this animal directl}^ between the ears, two of which 
lines, however, could not be made with the flat part of the file. There 
are two frog pipes of the mound type in the Douglass collection, one 
of which has eyes whicli protrude; the other has eyes bored through 
from side to side for the insertion of artificial objects. The scales of 
the frogs it would be possible to cut with a sharp stone point, but the 
fine lines look as though cut by sharp metal tools. 

One of the i^ipes having an urn-shaped bowl and another repre- 
senting an animal, possibly an otter or beaver, arising from the water, 
has a number of sharp file marks of regular length and equidistant, 
which it would be difficult if not impossible to imitate without steel 
tools. 

The Douglass collection contains two of the original Squier and Davis 
liiul from .Mound City, near Chillicothe, Ohio, one made apparently of 
an oolitic limestone, the other of a brownish stone of medium hardness, 
both representiug birds. The bowls of these specimens have been 
bored, as the others appear to have been, by means of tubular drills, 
and the irregularity of shape of one of the bowls, the cross section 
of which somewhat resembles an irregular circle, was probably made 
with a loose drill point, which would not inconvenience one working 
with strap or jiuinp drill, but wouhl be extremely awkward to make 
with a shaft revolved on the thigh or between the palms of the hands.

"Four miles north of Chillicotlie, Oliio, there lies, close to the Ohio 
lliver, ail embaukineiit of earth somewhat in the shape of a square 
with strongly rounded angles, and inclosing an area of 13 acres, over 
which twenty-three mouiuls are scattered without much regularity. 
This work has been called Mound City."' 

Squier and Davis say that the pi pes 
found at Mound City ''were inter- 
mixed with much ashes, pearl and 
shell beads, disks, tubes, etc., and a 
number of other ornaments of copper 
covered with silver."^ 

It were, indeed, difficult to con- 
ceive a more graceful design than 
fig. 12<S represents. It is one of the 
casts of a pipe collected by Squier 
and Davis in Mound No. 8, at Mound 
City, Ohio. The cast is 3 inches long, the bowl having an interior 
diameter of three-fourths of an inch, the pipe standing 1| inches in 
height. The snake is curled around the bowl with his tail extending 
along the base, the markings of the snake being represented by incised 
lines forming diamonds. 

The Marquis de Kadaillac illustrates a pipe from a mound in IMercer 
County, Illinois, made from an indurated clay, on which the snake is 
wound three times around the 
bowl.' 

Another of the mound type 
of pipes is shown in fig. 129, 
collected by Squier and Davis 
in Mound No. 8, Avhich in size 
varies little from the' preced- 
ing specimen. The frog sits 
in typical position as though 
ready to jump, the legs being 
well shown, as are the toes of 
the feet, those in front being 
well turned in and three toes 
on each foot. The eyes were depressed; the scales, scarcely one- six-^ 
teenth of an inch in diameter, are formed by incised lines all over thej 
body, having apparently been cut with a sharp-pointed tool. A some- 
what similar frog pipe found in a mound with one which was jilain isj

Two frog pipes iire referred to in tlie (ireat Bragge collection, one 
from Kentucky and the otlier from the Ohio iJiver, of steatite and gray 
limestone, respectively/ either of which localities is well within the 
mound pipe area. 

Fig. 130 is a cast of a catlinite mound pipe found on the banks of 
the Illinois Eiver, near Naples, Illinois, described by Mr. J. G. Hen- 
derson. It represents the com- 
mon hard-shelled turtle of the 
American rivers. The tnrtle is 
upon a short, round pedestal 
which rises from the curved 
base. In one of the eye holes 
there yet remains a cop])er bead 
representing the eyeball, the 
other being lost. The head is 
slightly extended from the shell; 
the tail is lyiog against the body, 
the feet being folded close to the 
body in front ; the stem hole being one eighth of an inch, and that of the 
bowl one-half inch in diameter. This specimen is 3^ inches, with a stem 
width of 1"| inches. 

Fig. 131, also one of the Squier and Davis Mound No. 8 pipes, is 
]trobably the best known of all this type. It is of about the same 
dimension as are the other pipes of this type and represents a typical 
Indian head. The eyes, nose, and mouth are well modeled and the 
ears are distinct. There is a knob on the toji of the head and two 

back of the ears, the signifi- 
cance of which it is difficult to 
explain, unless it be to desig- 
nate the hair tied up. This 
head sits well down on the base 
and faces the smoker, as is 
almost invariably the case in 
pipes of this type unless the 
stem has been broken, iu which 
event use is made of the oppo- 
site end. In some few in- 
stances an exception to the 
rule is observed in figures of 
birds facing the side of the stem and in one instance an animal is rep- 
resented as looking back over its shoulder. From top to bottom of the 
bases or platforms of these pipes is often less than one-fourth of an inch. 
To bore a one-eighth inch hole through this reipiires great care. This 
Indian-head pipe was found in the altar of the mound.'

Two other pipes were also found by Stinier and Davis representing 

human heads. Whether the (iowl-like appearance of this head is 

intended to represent some head covering or the liair is ditidcult to 

determine. 

The Indian is not usually represented with head covering, though 

subsequent to the arrival of 
the whites they did at times 
wear caps purchased from 
the Europeans, especially 
those Indians who came in 
contact with the French. 

Thomas Campanins Holm, 
referring to experiences in 
Kew Sweden about IG-to, says : 
"While my father and grand- 
father lived among them some 
Swedish Avomen had under- 
taken to make some small 
caps out of all kinds of old clothes, at the top of Avhich they tixed a tas- 
sel of various colors, which they made of different colored rags, which 
they unraveled and mixed together. Those caps pleased the Indians 
extremely and they gave good prices for them in tlieir money." ' 

Mr. J. G. Henderson has also figured a pipe from a mound near 
Naples, Illinois (fig. 132), which he believes represents a raccoon, tlie 
fore and hind legs of which are well carved. The nose is quite sharp, 
the tail lies flat and straight out along the 
base, the eyes are close together, and the 
beast appears to resemble in the cast a 
mouse quite as much as it does a raccoon, 
the ])Osition being more typical of tliat 
usually assumed by the mouse than it is of 
that of the raccoon, though it may be that 
Mr. rienderson is correct, for he says that 
in the original every feature of the animal 
is perfect, including the bars on the tail and 
face.- There is little doubt that animals 
and birds represented on these pipes are 
often impossible of identification. This 
pipe is said to be i)o]ished as smooth as 
glass and to be made of a very hard stone. 

There are many other animal forms which have been found in these 
mound types, including the beaver, bear, panther, and lizard. Others, 
however, it can not be denied, are most difficult to determine. In one

instance what is thought to resemble a grouudhog may, with equal 
reason, be said to be a ground squirrel. ^V fox can not be distinguished 
from a wolf; and many animals represented upon i>ipes of thi.s tyi)e 
have been declared by naturalists 
to resemble no well-detined genus 
with which they were acquainted. 

The original of a light gray cast in 
the U. S. National Museum (fig. l.">3) 
is of the mound type, and was also 
found in Mound IS^o. 8. It is 3^ 
inches long and 2{; inches high, with 
eyes carved in relief, the nostrils 
(juite distinct, and the mouth rei)re- 
sented by a long incised line. The 
curves back of the head may be in- 
tended to represent either ears or 
horns. This figure has been referred to as "a spirited head of the elk, 
though not minutely accurate."' Justice requires that we should say 
that tbis head resembles as much a sheep or horse as it does that of an 
elk or any of the deer family. 

Dr. E. A. Barber has illustrated a somewhat simi- 
lar pipe from Prairie du Chieu, Wisconsin, which 
he suggests may possibly represent the mountain 
sheep or goat. In this case the animal faces from 
the smokei'. This pipe is now in the Douglass col- 
lection,- and has had the front part of the stem 
broken. An inspection of the original suggests that 
the supposed horns are more likely intended for 
ears. Hon. Horace Beach, who collected the pipe, 
termed it "the dog j)ipe." 

Fig. 134 is another of the Mound No. 8 specimens 
from INIound City, Ohio, and is 4^ inches long with 
height of 2 inches. The bird is evidently feeding, 
though it is impossible to say whether it is an eagle 
or crow. The feathers are carefully carved on the 
tail, wings, and body, and while it can not be said 
that the work could not be done with a stone point, 
it looks as though the tool used was a metal one. 

The cast of an unusual i)ipe from a mound near 
Naples, Illinois, in Scott County, is shown in fig. 
135, collected by Judge John G. Henderson, of 
Winchester, Illinois. According to Dr. Charles Kau, "it is the finest 
mound pipe thus far known." It doubtless represents a hawk or

eagle; its great peculiarity being that the bird faces to the side rather 
than toward the smoker. It is said not to have been exposed to the 
heat of the lire, as so many mound i^ipes have. "A pipe shaped 
like an eagle, one of the real mound buikler's bird-shaped pii^es, was 
taken from the stone inclosure midway between Savannah and Fulton, 
Illinois. Its workmanship was perfect and its shape artistic to a high 
degree." ' 

The eagle and the hawk are both prominent among tlie totems of 
American Indians, and are frequently found on mound i)i[)es, though 
it must be admitted that birds are more difficult to identify tlian ani- 
nials. There were found in tlie mound near Kaples, Illinois, along 
with the raccoon i)ipe and turtle pipe, objects of copper, " and a remark- 
able specimen which may be designated a sun symbol — a white stone, 
perfectly round, 12:^ inches in diameter, about half an inch thick in the 
middle and 1 inch upon the edges, slightly concave upon one side and 
having upon the other a figure of a human hand."^ 

The mound jiipe is usually found associated with copper implements. 
The file marks observable so often upon those parts of the surface 
which are most difficult to polish indicate the use of steel implements, 
and the presence of silver makes one susjiect the influence of the white 
man. Judge Henderson's " perfectly round" disk is one of the strong- 
est arguments in favor of European manufacture, for perfectly round 
disks do not appear to belong to aboriginal art of the northern conti- 
nent, and when the delicate finish and artistic merit of the mound pipe 
is considered there is left the conviction that the European is the author 
of the type. 

In many museums are found objects of bone made by the Eastern 
Eskimo, many of them carved and etched with great skill; but, as has 
been noted by Prof. Otis T. Mason, all fine etching on bone or ivory, 
such as tlie work of these Eskimo, is in proportion to their contact with 
Europeans. From the older graves there has been revealed no etching, 
and the carvings he finds are rude in proportion to their removal from 
the white man's influence. 

The Davenport Academy of Natural Sciences has two pipes said to 
have been found in a mound in Muscatine County, Iowa, by some Ger- 
mans, one of ^vhich represents a bear and the other an elephant. Both 
are said to be out of proportion,^ as one is too tall and the other too 
slender. There is a second elephant pipe possessed by the Davenport 
Academy, from Louisa County, which was found in a mound in 1888.^ 

An illustration of one of the pipes is given after a photograph (fig. 
130). In both pipes the tail is said to be well developed. There was a 
criticism of the animal carvings from the mounds of the Mississippi

Valley, by Mr. Henry W. Hensliaw, from the standpoint of the natural- 
ist, based chietly on the famous Sqnier and Davis collection, in which 
he sums up his conclusions under four different heads as follows: 

First. That among the carvings from the mounds which can be iden- 
tified, there are no representations of birds or animals not indigenous 
to the ^Mississippi Valley, and conseijuently that the theories of origin 
for the mound builders suggested by the presence in the mounds of 
carvings of supposed foreign animals are without basis. 

Second. That a large majority of the carvings, instead of being, as 
assumed, exact likenesses from nature, possess in reality only the most 
general resemblance to the 
birds and animals of the re- 
gion which they were doubt- 
less intended to represent. 

Third. That there is no 
reason for believing that the 
masks and sculptures of 
human faces are more correct 
likenesses than are the ani- 
mal carvings. 

Fourth. That the state of 
art culture reached by the 
mound builders, as illustrated 
by their carvings, has been 
greatly overestimated.' 

These views can hardly be 
successfully combated by any- 
one at all familiar with the 
illustrations of the mound 

pipes ujdess it be contended that tlie illustrations themselves are defect- 
ive. The casts of these famous pipes, a complete set of which is in the 
U. S. National Museum, suggest that the illustrations have done full 
justice to the objects represented. Mr. Henshaw in his criticism ques- 
tioning the genuineness of the elephant i)ii)es appears to have fallen into 
error in saying that the tails are absent in each of these pipes, and his 
reference from a naturalist's standpointnaturallyignores the technolog- 
ical consideration of the subject, as well as the contemporaneity of 
metal in the mounds, especially copper, and also the many asserted dis- 
coveries of objects of undeniably European manufacture, such as an 
implement of copper being found in the same mound with one of these 
elephant pipes. All of which are of course important bits of evidence 
in any summary going to make up a verdict as to the artistic ability of 
those who made the pipes. 

While concurring entirely with Henshaw's summary, under the four 
heads, and while considering the same conclusively proven in favor of

524 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

bis contention, the writer, with due deference to the opinions ot the 
nian^^ wlio may disagree with his conchisions, woukl add: That tlie age 
of copper imideinents and their use by the American Indians does not 
appear to have been sufficiently studied to demonstrate to what extent 
tliey had been employed prior to the advent of the whites, nor for how 
long. The tool marks on objects and technology generally of the mound 
builders appears to have been little considered; the finding of worked 
silver in mound No. 8, and a silver cross either in this mound or in one 
near it, as recorded by Squier and Davis, and the finding so commonly 
in remains of the mound i)eriod objects of European manufacture, all 
raise the susj)iciou, almost amounting to conviction, that the pijies were 
contemporaneous with the early whites, probably the French. The two 
elephants suggest, of course, an acquaintance with the animal, and 
unless the Indian can be shown to have known the beast before the 
European invasion, which with our present evidence seems improbcible, 
the natural inference would be that this knowledge came from the 
whites, who we do know were well acquainted with the elephant, and 
as a consequence that the pipes were made after the European invasion 
of the country. The criticism of Henshaw caused quite a discussion in 
the archicologic world, though the fact remains that "the artistic merits 
of the mound builders pipes have in some cases been overrated." ^ 

Dr. Wilson, although suggesting this view, contends "that the objects 
wrought by their artistic skill reveal no less certainly their familiarity 
with animals of southern and even tropical latitudes, and the materials 
emjdoyed in their manufacture include mica of the Alleghenies, obsidian 
of Mexico, and jade and porphyry, derived probably from the same 
region or from others still farther south." - 

These views will, however, meet with little agreement in America, for 
there appears absolutely no proof of any southern infiuences affecting 
the work on the American mound-builders' pii)es. 

While in many instances it appears impossible to say exactly what 
was intended to be designed other than man, bird, or beast, it can not 
be denied that among the mound pipes there are many forms of life 
skillfully delineated and with true artistic merit. 

Some of these pipes are so carefully ground and their surfaces are so 
skillfully polished as to preclude the possibility of demonstrating the 
exact mechanical process employed in working them into shape, though 
parts of the work of finishing can at times be determined in a measure. 
The bowls of mound pipes have been bored usually with tubular metal 
drills, though there are examples bored with solid i)oint. The uniform 
size of the bowls suggest that if bored by Indian tools, it was done with 
the solid shaft revolved betx^^eeu the hands. There are exceptions 
known in which the bowl has an irregular shaiJC, owing to a loose point 
on the drill shaft, which would suggest its being caused by the employ-

AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 525 

mcnt of a strap or pump drill, tools apj)areutly uukiiowu until the 
whites came into the country. 

The pii^es iu shape of the human liead are remarkably well executed; 
the snake is not to be mistaken, nor the frog, nor the beaver; members 
of the cat tribe appear to be represented, and the turtle; though of 
these the species is often indeterminate. Birds are usually distinguish- 
able only as birds; scarcely a single one can be positively recognized as 
to species. Elephant pipes are as good representations of the animal as 
are those of any other creature of which examples have been found. 
The artistic ability to imitate in stone animal form and action is no 
more developed in pipes of the mouud-builder type than it is in stone 
carvings made by Indians iu contact with the white man of the present 
day, the latter producing work equal, if not suj^erior, to any from the 
mounds. An argument in favor of the contemporaneity of these j)ipes 
with the whites is that were they of i^urely aboriginal origin we would 
find also numerous examples of their idols or fetishes, executed with 
similar artistic ability. If these objects were of local white origin, we 
may safely infer that while the whites would supply pipes in effigy of 
man or beast, the religious prejudices both of early French and English 
during the seventeenth century would have caused either to recoil with 
horror from any attempt to further idolatry or idolatrous worship f(u^ 
fear of their own future punishment did they do so. Mr. "William 
Wallace Tooker, says: "The discovery of the monitor pipe among the 
efligies of Wisconsin, with curved base, a round bowl, and the same 
finish as those found in the mounds of Ohio, I regard as an additional 
link iu the chain of evidence that they are of Algonquin manufacture 
wherever found. Here I regret to differ with Prof. Cyrus Thomas, who 
attributes this form of \)ipe to the Cherokees.'' ^ 

An examination of the geographical distribution of mound pipes 
apparently sustains Mr. Tooker's assertion that they are not of Cherokee 
origin, though he appears to consider the monitor and mound pipe as 
identical, which to the writer they do not appear to be. The hollow of 
both bowl and stem in the platform or monitor pipe is usually larger 
than in the mound pipe. The former always has a flat base, while the 
latter is curved. Tl'ie monitor seldom, if ever, has any ornamentation 
upon it in the way of figures of animals; the latter commonly has. 
The monitor does not appear often west of Ohio. The mound i)ipe is 
as often found in Illinois, Iowa, and Michigan, as in Ohio. The monitor 
is found in Tennessee, !Xorth Carolina, and South Carolina, and iu the 
northern United States. The mound pipe is not found in the States 
bordering on the Atlantic. The monitor is made from a soft stone and 
the mound pipe from a much harder one. General Gates W Thrustou 
considers, after careful examination of some of the originals and of 
casts of the Squier and Davis collection, that as tyi)es of the mound-

526 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

builders' art tlie fine Tennessee and southern pipes are not inferior to 
the Ohio mound pipes.' 

The geographical distribution of mound pipes indicates two centers, 
one near Chillicothe, Ohio; the other near Davenport, Towa, with some 
in Illinois and few in Indiana, about Laporte, near the lower edge of 
Lake Michigan. 

Colden's Five Nations (1747) indicates the existence of certain great 
carries, then well known, between the headwaters of the Hudson 
and Lake Champlain; Lake Erie and the headwaters of the Allegheny; 
another from Lake Erie, by way of the Maumee, to the Wabash; 
another from the Maumee to the headwaters of the St. Joseph and then 
into Lake Michigan. The absence of mound pipes, or their scarcity, even 
in Illinois and Indiana is merely negative testimony, but taking the 
extremes of Chillicothe and Davenport, what would be the easiest route 
from the former to the latter? To float down the Scioto to the Ohio 
and down the Ohio to and up the Mississippi to Davenport, Iowa, would 
take one through a country where this jjipe is not found, or so rarely 
found as to negative the likelihood of this being the direction of travel. 
This route would also be through a country where one would, during 
the seventeenth century, more probably have encountered antagonistic 
linguistic stocks than would have been the case had the route up the 
Scioto, across to the head of the Maumee, from the Maumee across to 
the St. Joseph been followed down to Lake Michigan, and from the 
lake either by way of Oreen Bay to the Wisconsin, and down it or by 
crossing the carry in the neighborhood of Chicago, and down the Fox 
liiver into the Illinois, or to strike the Rock River and down it to the 
Mississippi. This northern route and then westward, followed by any 
of the waters indicated, would carry one through afltiliated tribes at 
the early period of our history, and throughout this indicated territory 
the mound pipe appears common. Again, if the mound pipes owe their 
origin in anyway to white influences, the territory through which they 
are found is within the area first reached by the French, who spread 
over the interior waters, by way of the lakes, as a base from which the 
St. Lawrence could be most easily reached. Admitting French influ- 
ences as ati'ecting the style of the mound pipe, their not being found 
along the shores of Erie and Ontario or on the St. Lawrence would 
indicate strongly that the foreign influence was one indigenous to the 
interior, which is easily explainable upon the theory that it was a sup- 
ply made to meet a local demand. Were the mound pipes of great age 
it is not likely that specimens would be found of catlinite, from which 
some were made, if we may rely upon the records. The vast distance 
from which it had to be brought, from the country of a people of dis- 
tinct linguistic stock, would also indicate no great antiquity to its use, 
but the material, we know, after the advent of the whites, became an 
article of barter, chiefly, the writer believes, due to the spread of gen- 
eral trade with the natives.

AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PJPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 527 

The specimens of pipes in tlie collection of the V. S. jS^ationnl ^luseiim 
of the mound type have usually plain bowls, and there is absolutely no 
reason to suppose them to be other than they are represented. They 
have been examined closely for surface indications of tool marks, which 
were found in most instances, and suggest the presence of the metal hie 
of the whites. Their geographical distribution would also suggest 
Lake ^Michigan or Erie as being the point of origin of the type rather 
than either of the extremes of Chillicothe or Davenport. The similar- 
ity of the type is undoubtedly due to a common origin for the Iowa 
and Ohio pipes, though the curved base of Ohio appears to have a 
tendency to flatten along the Mississippi bank of the State of Iowa, 
though it would be natural to suppose the flat base more ancient and 
more readily made than the curved. The localities where these pipes 
are usually found corresponds with the route which Marquette and other 
French travelers appear to have followed down to the Mississippi and 
into Ohio from Lake Erie, which is presumably the route well known 
to the fur traders who preceded the discoverers. The style of the carv- 
ing on these i^ipes is certainly more of 
a civilized than of a savage character, 
and undoubtedly belongs to a much 
higher art than other prinntive and 
ancient objects found on the North 
American continent, and does not cor- 
respond with what is known of the 
l)roduct of the Indians' primitive tools.

to whether the mound type ot pi])e had 

been found in Ontario or on the St. Lawrence, that, " indeed it would 
not surprise me to find a few stray pipes of this kind in Ontario, but 
nothing of the sort has come to my notice. If French influence was in 
any way connected with the curved base, nothing is more reasonable 
than that numerous examples of it should be met with in this country, 
but, while I am not in a position to state positively, I have never even 
heard of one. I think that the fact of curved base pipes being found 
always on the line of French travel is merely a coincidence and a very 
natural one. Those who aflected this style of pipe along the valleys of 
the Scioto, the Wabash, the Illinois, and the Wisconsin were the people 
among whom the voi/ageur and the coureaur du hois met with most suc- 
cess in their trading operations, and the following of the river routes 
was as natural to the Frenchman as to the Indian. That many pipes 
are the product of European skill is, I think, undoubted, but I some- 
times think also there is a tendency to attribute too much to this source. 
It is undoubted that there is a tendency to modernize the Indian and 
his manufactures, though, on the other hand, those favoring his great

antiquity have for so long held the field that to raise the question will 
only open the door to impartial examination and final successful deter- 
mination after a thorough investigation of all the proofs." 

Fig. 137 is a straight-based white limestone i)ipe of the mound type, 
collected by Mr. P. W. Norris. Though the bowl is very plain and the 
base extends only on one side of it, th<'- stem opening of this j)ipe is 
three-eighths of an inch and that of the bowl about 1 inch, which 
marks this specimen as quite unusual for this type in its stem, from 
the large opening. It was found at Clifton, Kanawha County, West 
Virginia, and is very much weathered and as soft, almost, as chalk. 
Another specimen of this type, having an unusually large stem, is in 
the Douglass collection, which was found in Iligliland County, Ohio, 
being made of a light gray stone. Yet another, apparently rehited to 
these two, having a stem opening of three-eighths of an inch, is in the 
same collection and is from Putnam County, West Virginia. 

DOUBLE CONOIDAL PIPES. 

There is yet another and markedly distinct type of pipe which is 
found distributed over a wide, though contiguous, area, which invites 
most careful scrutiny, whether from a technological, archaeological, 
or ethnological standpoint. The characteristics entitling it to be 

classed as of like type are, that the 
bowl and stem holes consist of conoi- 
dal excavations made at right angles 
to each other, meeting at their apices 
where the two cavities intersect. This 
type, in its exterior form, varies 
greatly, in fact more than probably 
any other American type known, yet 
the stem and bowl are so true to type 
as to stamp a kinship which is diffi- 
cult to ignore. Did we alone consider 
merely the biconical perforations, in 
the majority of instances it would be 
impossible to say which was intended 
to hold the stem and which the tobacco, 
and it nuist further be admitted that 
in the whole number of pipes of this 
type in the collection of the IT. S. National Museum there is not a 
single specimen which has upon it, so far as the writer could observe, a 
mark indicative of the use of other than the stone tool of the primitive 
Indian, though many of this type are of quite elaborate design. Certain 
similar art concepts are observable in this type within restricted areas 
and it will be interesting to determine whether they are due to tribal, 
totemic, or trade influences. The materials of which these pipes are 
made are as varied as the pipes themselves. They are found of pottery, 
indurated clay, steatite, and even sandstone. The pottery of some is

pure clay; of others the clay is mixed with a shell or sand tempering. 
Some of the material is most suitable, other is most unsuitable, to resist 
heat. Some of these pipes are found made of the most primitive form 
and others of the most ornate, showing an artistic conception and excel- 
lence of treatment quite remarkable. 

Fig. 138, collected by Mr. W. M. Clark, from MclS^airy County, Tennes- 
see, is an almost perfectly square block of reddish sandstone, about 3 
inches in exterior diameter, which has been hammered or picked into 
shape without the slightest efibrt to smooth its surfaces, its stem and 
bowl cavities each being cone-shaped and about half an inch in diameter 
at the surface with a like depth, and are at right angles to each other, in- 
tersecting at the apices of the inverted cones where the opening between 
the bowl and stem is scarcely one-fourth of an inch in diameter. There 
is no evidence in this specimen of any tool being used, even in exca- 
vating the bowl and stem, except a picking implement. The chief 
distinction between this pipe and 
the ordinary bowl pipe is that in 
the latter the stem opening is sel- 
dom in excess of one half the diame- 
ter of the opening of the bowl and 
is generally much less, though it 
must be admitted that this differ- 
ence could be reconciled were it 
owing to difference in supply of 
stem material.

ently to this type (tig. 139), is from

pebble of gray sandstone, upon 

which almost the only artificial work has been performed in excavating 
the bowl and stem openings and in making shallow depressions on each 
side, as though to indicate the eyes of some creature. In outline this 
stone is unattractive, and were it not for the eyes would be scarcely 
more remarkable than the first figure of this type. A striking and 
somewhat typical characteristic of this pipe appears on its base, which 
has been fiat, but is worn in its longer diameter into quite abroad, deep 
groove, evidently caused by being used as a grindstone for sharpening 
tools. Upon the back of this pipe the stone has been slightly ground 
above and below the stem hole. There is in the collection of the museum 
of the University of Pennsylvania a similar specimen from West Vir- 
ginia, made of brown stone, having a bowl 1| inches in exterior diame- 
ter. The diameter of the stem is large, but its dimensions can not be 
given because of the scaling of the stone. Around one part of the side 
of the stem opening where it is not scaled two rings are cut in intaglio,

After specimen in possession of Warren K, Moorehead, 



one larger than the other ; eyes are also incised. Across the front of 
this stone are incised a nnmber of straight lines, one above the other, 
the significance of which it is difficult to guess. Except as noted, the 
stone presents only a water- washed appearance, saving that on the bot- 
tom appears again the long, deeply worn groove made by sharpen- 
ing tools, which is cut deep into the stone. This peculiarity in the 
natural shape of the i)ebble aj^pears to have been suggestive to the 

Indian mind of tbe form of an animal, 
which he has endeavored to perfect by 
cutting a few lines across the stone. 
A specimen of this tyi)e (fig. 140), 
found by Mr. Warren K, Moorehead 
in Ohio, though badly broken, shows 
how the Indian has taken advantage 
of the peculiar shape of a water- 
washed pebble to make a pipe. The 
material is a sandstone, which one 
would suppose was poorly suited to 
resist the heat generated in smoking 
it. Yet here was a shape suggestive of animal form which would cause 
a child or even a grown person to preserve it, which, with the slightest 
addition, would give the most primitive representation of animal form 
which we have met with. There are few archaeologists who have not at 
some time been astonished to find water- washed pebbles or concretions 
of unusual shapes on the sites of Indian villages which had evidently 
been collected and preserved by the Indian because of their resem- 
blance to some creature or ob 
ject. All experience has a ten- 
dency to impress the archcTolo- 
gist with the fact that man in a 
savage state had quite a lively 
appreciation of grace of out- 
line in stones or shells, as well 
as that he would be impressed 
with brilliance of color,whether 
it were in the plumage of birds, 
the tint of shells, or the bril- 
liance of foliage. 

An unattractive and unorna- 
mental pipe of rectangular shape (fig. 141), collected by Brig. Gen. 
D. Swift, of the United States Army, from Louisiana, having the upper 
part of its bowl broken, but with peculiarities entitling it to be classed 
in this type, is of sandstone and has the groove for tool sharpening on 
its base, in addition to the similarity in diameter of bowl and stem open- 
ing. Upon one corner of the base there is a drill hole, which has been 
begun and is an eighth of an inch wide with a depth of about three-

sixteenths of an inch, two simihir depressions being on the front of 
the pipe. 

Another rectangnlar, double conical pipe (fig. 142), found in a mound 
in Louisiana, collected by Brig. Gen. D. Swift, United States Army, is of 
soft white sandstone, about 3 inches long, w'ith an equal height, and a 
width of 2 inches. It is, however, 
badly broken and worn, and though 
upon one side there is a scroll-work 
design which extends around the 
front, upon the other side the erosion 
of time has eaten away all signs of or- 
namentation. The sigmoidal curves 
are gracefully executed, and though 
the stem is slightly deeper than is 
the bowl, each has been bored by 
means of broad-pointed drills, pre- 
serving the biconical characteristic 
of the type. There are two bands 
around this bowl — one plain and the 
other gracefully curved, with semicurved lines from the interior edge 
of the bowl to the plain band, which gives the appearance of a rope 
encircling the upper edge of the bowl. 

This type is apparently, the same, in fig. 143, from southeastern Mis- 
souri, collected by Mr. F. S. Earle, which is slightly larger than the 
last figure and is made of a compact, fine-grained sandstone. The 

decoration of this pipe, the shape 
of bowl and stem — in fact, the 
entire pipe — are suggestive of a 
knowledge of pottery. The base 
is massive in proportion to the size 
of the rest of the pipe, and is sug- 
gestive of similar characteristics 
in pipes of this class. The stem 
shows a somewhat greater elonga- 
tion than does the bowl, though 
the biconical bowl and stem are 
little changed. Six crosses sur- 
round the bowl, which are of so 
pronounced a Greek type as to 
suggest the white man's presence; 
and although many archteologists 
instance supposed pre-Columbian occurrences of the cross, it must be 
suggested that the occurrence of several crosses together raise more 
strongly the suspicion of the presence of the European than would a 
single cross, especially throughout the territory where Spanish and 
French influences were first felt. The pioneers of these regions were 
often members of religious orders, whom all early accounts record were

the first to raise the cross upon entering every Indian village. The 
French constantly refer to this practice, as do the Spanish, notably 
Castaneda, chronicler of the expedition of Alarcou, as well as the early 
missionaries of the Mississippi River.' 

Fig. 144 is distinctly of the same type and differs from the three 

preceding specimens only in that it 
is made of a gray serpentine. The 
sijecimen is 4 inches long, 3 inches 
high, and If inches wide, the biconi- 
cal characteristics of bowl and stem 
bei n g of proper corresponding dimen- 
sions. It was found in Mobile Bay, 
being collected by Mr. C. Caderte. 
The elongated stemmed specimens 
of this type appear to have been 
scraped into shape and finally 
ground to a uniform surface. There 
is in the U. S. National Museum a 
specimen (Cat. No. 59279) of chloritic 
slate which has been shaped by first 
sawing out the form, which subsequently was scraped iind ground to a 
uniform surface. Similar work is evidenced in modern unfinished stone 
pipes from California and Oregon in the U. S. National Museum. This 
process by which they were finished corresponds with stonework noticed 
on implements found in Swiss 
lake dwellings of the stone 
period. The work upon any 
given implement would natu- 
rally depend upon the hard- 
ness of the particular material. 
On certain of the biconical pipes 
the bowl and stem cavities ap- 
pear to have been first started 
by pecking a depression into 
the surface. This would be en- 
larged by a solid drill or at times 
even finished with the drill, 
though there are specimens 
which have had the cavities 
enlarged by gouging, a very common practice with all pipes of soft stone. 
A careful study of American stone implements, or those, in fact, of 
the stone age elsewhere, demonstrates, with scarcely an exception, that 
primitive man shaped stone tools with the least possible labor. Few 
implements of the stone period required so long as a week to make

southeastern Missouri (fig. 143), and 
retains the biconical characteristics in 
bowl and stem openings, both of which 
have been gouged out with a chisel, 
the pipe being 3i inches long.

shape of the pipe indicates that similar ones were made of pottery. 
The stem hole of this pipe is slightly smaller than that of the bowl, 
both being drilled, however, with a solid point.

from a stone grave in southeastern Missouri, are in the museum of the 
University of Pennsylvania, whicli also possesses a light clay pipe of 
this type, upon the surface of which are a number of circular stamped 
impressions in the clay. There is also in the same museum a partly 
decorated pipe of this type from Kershaw, South Carolina, made of a 
light yellow pottery, and yet another made of 
steatite found on the site of an Indian town in 
a grave 2 feet below the surface near Camden, 
South Carolina, which has a double row of orna- 
mental figures running around stem and bowl. 
These last two pipes have been illustrated by 
Schoolcraft. ^ 

A unique specimen of a pottery pipe (fig. 148) 
is from St. Johns River, Florida, and was col- 
lected by Col. C S. Taylor. It is only an inch 
high, with a like length, and was found in a 
mound, though there can be no doubt of its 
modern origin, as it yet retains the mold mark 
and stamp of a tobacco plant and the coat of 
arms of the pipe makers' guild of London, though the type does not 
appear to be that of any of the many early known ones turned out by 
English pipe makers, being the only specimen which has come to the 
writer's notice. 

In fig. 149 is again encountered the projection common in the territory 
contiguous to the Sioux. It is a pottery 
pipe, the clay from which it is made having 
a mixture of shells. It is from Indian Bay, 
Lonoke County, Arkansas. It is about 3 
inches long and of like height, the band 
around the bowl being decidedly ornamen- 
tal. The size of bowl and stem retain 
the characteristically large dimensions of 
the biconical pipe cavities. There is in the 
U. S. National Museum collection a light- 
colored clay pipe of this type from Pecan 
Point, Mississippi County, Arkansas, the 
bowl of which has been badly broken, 
though enough remains to show that a 
snake was twined around it, the head being 
yet intact. The stem of this pipe is ellip- 
tical and the point less pronounced in front of the bowl than in any of 
the pipes figured. 

While retaining bowl and stem characteristics, fig. 150 is a hard- 
burned pottery specimen from Carroll County, Tennessee, collected by 
Rev. E. H. Randall. It presents quite a peculiar feature in the band or

liaudle reaching from the end of the stem to the toj) of the bowl, a 
somewhat simihir characteristic appearing on the pipe from Tennessee 
(lig. l.*07), ill which -the hair or cue forms a somewhat similar orna- 
mentation. This baiul is possibly intended tor the double purpose of 
attaching the cord to the stem and as an ornament. It is decidedly 
shorter, however, than others of 
these pipes ui)on which the Siouan 
prow ap])ears. A somewhat si mi 
lar pipe, though of stone, from 
Hickman County, Kentucky, is 
figured by Dr. Joseph Jones, the 
handle of which he thinks is in imi- 
tation of the armadillo.' 

A pottery pipe (fig. 151) from 
Loudon County, Tennessee, col- 
lected by Mr. J. W. Emmert, has a 
bowl apparently formed in shape of 
those uf the biconical type, though 
its stem belongs rather to a class 
of i)ipes found commonly in North 
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, 

and Tennessee, many of which are of metal, while others are of stone 
made in imitation of metal or pottery forms. The pottery of which this 
specimen is made has a large percentage of shell mixed with the clay. 
Are these pipes of Cherokee type, concerning which it has been said 
"they (the Cherokees) smoked sumac leaves 
in wooden i)ipes, the tube of which was made 
of cane. I have seen such pipes belonging to 
them which were in the shape of a bear — the 
opening for the tobacco on the back and the 
tube fixed near the tail,"^ or does the author 
refer to those heavy pipes of biconical form in 
imitation of animals'? Thruston has called 
attention to this type,»saying : " Large funnel- 
shaped stem holes, sometimes even larger 
than the pipe bowls, appear to the author to 
have been one of the distinguishing charac- 
teristics of the southern clay and stone 
pil)es, and we suggest to antiquarians the 
importance of this feature in the projjer clas- 
sification of these objects." *

liiia, Georgia, and Alabama, over to and down the Mississippi Eiver, 
and up the same as far as Michigan, generally upon the eastern side of 
the great river, through a territory familiar to the French from 1680 
onward for nearly a century. Animal forms are ciuite common in this 

type, those of the human 
being probably predomi- 
nating ; some appear to be 
totemic, while the artistic 
merits of many are of a 
character difficult to rec- 
oncile with savage art. 
These pipes are at times so 
massive as almost to jus- 
tify the term monumental 
in referring to them, a re- 
markable peculiarity being 
that, with S(;arcely an ex- 
ception, the creature faces 
from instead of toward the 
smoker, as is common with the mound pipes and the older catlinite 
rectangular specimens. They vary from 3 to 8 inches in length or 
height, and from 2 to 4 inches in width. Among the animal forms 
none is more common than the frog. 

A pipe of the biconical type from Algansee, Branch County, Michi- 
gan, collected by H. T. Woodman (tig. 152) is about 1 inches long and 
almost as wide, and is 2^ inches high. 
The legs and eyes are represented in low 
relief, the bowl and stem holes are both 
pecked in, and each has a surface diam- 
eter of 1^ inches. The pipe is made from 
a compact and hard, close-grained sand- 
stone, shaped by means of a stone ham- 
mer, and though the surface has been 
subsequently smoothed the hammer 
marks in jjlaces are quite distinct. 

In fig. 153 is shown a pipe from the 
Cherokee Nation, collected by Mr. J. A. 
Paxton. The frog has been carved some- 
what more in the round, the texture of 
the stone appearing so like the last fig- 
ure as to raise a suspicion that both 
came from the same locality. The stem 
hole of this pipe is scarcely half an inch in depth, and that of the bowl 
hardly over seven-eighths of an inch deep, the stem being smaller than 
the bowl opening, the shallowness of the same making it extremely 
difficult to attach a pipestem. The base of this pipe has the same

Simihir to the two preceding si)ecimeus is tig. 154, a cast from Miami 
County, Ohio, collected by Dr. E. IL Davis, the original being of brown 
stone. It is carved with greater 
skill than either of the other speci- 
mens, is 5 inches long, with a corre- 
sponding height, and has a width 
of ."U inches. The hind legs are 
more in relief than in the other spec- 
imens, the fore legs being carved 
entirely in the round. The eyes of 
this frog are represented by depres- 
sions, but in other respects there is 
great similarity of treatment of all 
three figures. 

The characteristics of the biconi 
cal type are preserved in fig. 155, a 
pottery j^ipe from Nelson County, 
Virginia, collected by Mr. J. Ealls 

Abell. The specimen is 1 inches long, 3^ inches wide, and 2 J inches 
high, made from a clay mixed with shells, though it is quite indiffer- 
ently burned. The hind legs are molded in high relief, the fore legs 
being brought together under the chin. The eyes are quite prominently 
raised above the surface. Into the pottery a number of rings have 

been cut after the pipe was 
baked. 

A light-colored pottery 
pipe (fig. 150) from a mound 
in Coahama County, Mis- 
sissippi, collected by Hon. 
J. L. Alcorn, represents 
some quadruped, though it 
would require a vivid imag- 
ination to be more specific 
and say for what it was in- 
tended. The pipe is 5 inches 
long, ."> inches wide, and 3.J 
inches high, and represents 
the creature as about to 
hop or jump away. Into the face the eyes have been cut, and both 
above and below them are three straight cross lines parallel to each 
other. From the side of the head or jaw there are wing-like extensions 
upon which eight or nine parallel lines are cut into the pottery ware. 
On the top of the head are two knobs on each side, as though intended 
to indicate horns and ears. The fore legs are rudely modeled in the

round. The upper edge of the bowl, which is 1^ inches in diameter, is 
.^lightly raised above the surrounding surface, and instead of one there 
are two stem holes connecting with the bowl, each of which is about 
the same diameter as is the bowl. The double stem or double bowl is 

a feature, though not a common 
one, in American pipes. The clay 
from which this pijte was made does 
not appear to have either shells or 
sand tempering. 

Fig. 157 is a soft, coarse, gray 
sandstone pipe from a mound in 
Louisiana, collected by Brig. Gen. 
D. Swift, United States Army, and 
stands 3 inches high and repre- 
sents some four-footed creature ; this 
pipe, however, has not been com- 
pleted, for neither eyes, nose, nor 
mouth are indicated. The legs are 
represented in the manner at times 
observed in toys, or as they appear upon certain of the statues found 
by Layard at Koyounjik. The slightly raised bowl has the same treat- 
ment observed in the preceding pottery specimen ; the stem hole has 
been enlarged by gouging, while upon the base is found an ovoidal 
depression, a grinding surface com- 
monly encountered in the biconical 
pipes. A somewhat similar speci- 
men, though made from clay, found 
in the Yazoo River, Mississippi, is 
figured in Squier and Davis's An- 
cient Monuments.^ 

The crouching animal (fig. 158) 
from Hot Springs, Arkansas, col- 
lected by Mr. L. H. Thing, made 
from a soft cretaceous limestone, is 
5i inches long and 4 inches high, 
with a width of 3 inches. The bowl 
at its top is slightly raised above 
the creature's back, and running 
from its raised rim there is a nar- 
row baud to the head, and a slightly 
broader one extends back until it joins the stem hole. The eyes are* 
depressions cai'efully cut into the stone, while the mouth is designated 
by three drill holes barely started. There are lines cut into the face 
giving to the head a ferocious expression. The nose is represented by 
two ridges, one of which has been broken away, and over the eye a

circle is cut into the stone, probably intended as an ornament. Unfor- 
tunately, weathering has destroyed a part of the face. The general 
treatment of this tigure gives it a resemblance to certain carvings 
found in Mexico. 

A quartzite figure having a human head (fig. 159), from a flat-toj) 
mound near Clarendon, Monroe 
County, Arkansas, collected by 
Mr. C. W. Morris, though much 
larger than the jireceding speci- 
mens, being 7 inches long, with 
bowl and stem opening each of a 
diameter of 1| inches, retains 
characteristically the biconical 
type. The material from which 
this is made is most unusual, for 
perforated quartzite objects are 
extremely rare among aboriginal 
implements, though examples are 
not unknown. In boring this 
bowl it is most singular that sev- 
eral small i)erforatious have first been made and subsequently broken 
into one — a common practice in working stone among European stone- 
cutters, but, it is imagined, unique among Indian implements. On the 

left side of the back are a number 
of incised wavy parallel lines, while 
over the left ear is a disk-like orna- 
mental object. Eyes, nose, mouth, 
and fingers have been first pecked 
into shape and subsequently 
ground. The face is broad and 
scarcely superior to the work ob- 
served upon sculptures from the 
Easter Islands, though it is by no 
means the face of an Indian. 

In fig. 160 is seen very similar 
treatment to the preceding figure. 
This pipe was found in a mound at 
Kingston, Tennessee, and was col- 
lected by Mr. J. W. Dunning. It 
is but 5 inches long, with a height 
of 6 inches. The face is typically 
Indian. The man is represented as 
crouching on his knees, his left hand lying on the left knee. There 
is on the head a hat or other covering, while from under it falls on 
either side a pendant representing the hair. This hat or head gear 
looks suspiciously like the capote or bonnet of the French voyageur.

being raised, while in the left hand the hunter holds his bow. Tliere 
is no right hand or arm, the head and neck of a deer or fawn taking its 
place. Ou the back, between the bowl and stem openings, are four or 
five incised lines somewhat of the character of the Arkansas specimen 

(fig. 159). Tlie face of the hunter, looking 
fixedly forward, is of European type. The 
treatment is highly artistic and could no 
more be attributed to savage art than 
could a music box should one chance to 
be found in a mound. 

Fig. 102 is an almost black pottery 
pipe 3 inches long, the paste of which it 
was made being largely mixed with shells, 
and is strikingly similar in treatment to 
the stone specimen (tig. GO) from Tennes- 
see. Though this pipe appears to belong 
to the biconical type, they are so clearly 
alike as to force the conviction of kinship 
between them. While the stone pipe has six fingers, both specimens 
represent the left hand, each holds the pipe bowl, and each has a similar 
base. Professor Putnam probably refers to pipes of this type upon the 
opposite side of the river from Madisouville, Ohio, when he says : " For

the first time the large pipes cut iu stone iii the form of human figures 
have been found associated with skeletons. This is an important dis- 
covery, as heretofore such pipes have only been known from surface 
finds, although they have been attributed 
to the people who made the mounds." ^ 

IDOL PIPES. 

Fig. 163, made of soapstone, is quite com- 
plex, and is one of the most interesting of 
American ty])es found. It is from a mound 
in Kichmond County, Georgia, collected by 
Prof. Cyrus Thomas. It was found close to 
the tire bed of Hollywood Mound and not 
many inches from a copper ax. In about 
the same layer were also found bits of 
china and iron nails, sufficiently strong evi- 
dence, one Avould supi^ose, to prove the con- 
temporaneous presence of whites and In- 
dians. This pipe belongs to what Mr. 
Charles C. Jones designates as "the idol 
pipes, which are attributed to tlie men who 
threw up those large mounds which tower 
along the banks of the Etowah Kiver, al- 
ways associated, as far as we know, with large pentagonal and quad- 
rangular mounds."^ 

It should be observed that two of the three pipes here figured of 
persons holding bowls have their stems much smaller than are those 

of the biconical i)ipes, and the one 
from the Etowah Mound made of 
l>ottery has a stem of the same ty])e 
as the rectangular pottery pii)es from 
Georgia. 

Fig. 1G4: was found in association 
in the mound in Monroe County with 
fig. 159, and is 4i inches long and 4 
inches high, with a width of 23 
inches, and is made from an imper 
fectlj^ crystallized quartz, the arms 
and hands clasping the vessel consti- 
tuting the bowl of the pipe. The 
head is an extremely rude carving, 
treated in a most primitive manner, 
the eyes being mere circular incisions cut on a flattened disk by means 
of a pointed toolj the nose is represented by two spots drilled slightly

into the material, a straight incised line answering for tlie month. Up 
and down the bowl are a nnmber of equidistant parallel lines intended 
for ornament, though the work appears to be done with stone tools. 
Though the size of the stem in proportion to that of the bowl decreases 
in this class, the biconical features are largely retained. Schoolcraft 
figures an "idol pipe" similar to those here shown from near Browns- 
ville, on the Ohio River. 

Fig. 165, while rude in execution, exhibits similar artistic ability to 
that evidenced in the two preceding pipes. It is made of pottery and 
represents a person clasping a bowl somewhat in the manner repre- 
sented in the other figures, though leaving no doubt that each repre- 
sents contemporaneous art. This pii^e 
is from the Etowah Mound, in Bartow 
County, Georgia, collected by Dr. Roland 
Steiner, and has unfortunately had the 
head broken from the body. Here in the 
inclosure also appear to have been found 
objects of European manufacture. The 
clay of which this pipe is made does not 
appear to contain tempering material, 
and another noticeable feature and devia- 
tion from the type is the decreased size 
of the stem and its similarity to certain 
other pipes found in this mound which 
the writer will show to be probably quite 
modern and similar in charactejistics to i)ipes found in the Hollywood 
Mound, Richmond County, Georgia, where also objects of European 
origin were discovered. ' 

A similar pipe is evidently referred to in the description of one found 
in the stone graves of Tennessee, from which Professor Putnam says 
"only eight pijies had been found in the opening of several thousand 
graves, among which was a clay pipe with an ornamented bowl, two 
others were of pottery, and all the rest of stone; one of the latter elab- 
orately carved, representing a man holding a cooking pot, which formed 
the bowl of the pipe."^ 

GREAT PIPES. 

Fig. 166 is the cast of a pipe said to be from Kentucky, collected by 
Mr. H. A. Ward, and appears to be an unfinished " great pipe" of the 
Indians, which had been hammered into shape but never finished. It 
is 10 inches long, 8i inches wide, and 6 inches high, representing a bird 
with extended wings, as though in the act of flying. A striking pecul- 
iarity of this pipe is that the depression in the breast is the only evi- 
dence in the cast of a stem hole, and is unfinished. If this be the case 
in the original, it is the only specimen of this type of pipe where the

stein does not enter at the back of the object. There is in the U. S. 
National Museum a cast of a somewhat similar pipe from Mississippi, 
and yet another in the Douglass collection. 

One of the most elaborately ornate pipes known (fig. 1G7) is from 
Lexington, Kentncky, 
collected by Mr. J. 
Peter, which is 10 
inches in its greatest 
length, 9 inches high, 
and 2.^ inches wide, the 
bowl being 1^ inches in 
diameter, while that of 
the stem, which is un- 
der the bird's tail, has 
a diameter of only 
three- fourths of an 
inch. The bowl and 
stem are at right 
angles to each other, 
having been bored by 
means of solid drill points. This pipe represents a bird sitting in an 
erect position, with its eyes, wings, and tail feathers conventionally 
carved into the green steatite of which the pipe is made. Reverse 

this, however, with the 
bowl upon a flat sur- 
face and the bird on its 
back, and the specimen 
becomes a rude but 
very distinct carving 
of a human head and 
neck, and, though the 
ornamentation of this 
specimen is rudely con- 
ventional, it so dis- 
tinctly represents a 
white man's conception 
of the treatment as to 
almost preclude other 
hypothesis. This be- 
lief is strengthened by 
a coin or medal of silver 
struck off during the 
Commonwealth, which, when held erect, represented the head of Crom- 
well, and being turned upside down, showed a caricature of someone 
else of the period. While the Commonwealth would suggest a date 
about 1649-1G59, the pipe might be of any period thereafter. ISTot-

witlistauding tbe fact of this pipe being influenced by modern art, 
the work upon it is primitive in its character, though the lines have 
been incised with sharp-edged tools. There is in the U. S. National 
Museum collection another biconical pipe made of a soft yellow 
sandstone in imitation of a bird sitting on a perch, which was found 
in Maury County. Tennessee, the outlines of which are distinct 
though the specimen itself is quite rude. Squier 
and Davis also represent several pipes in 
human form, the persons figured being in a 
crouching i)osition, one other being that of an 
animal showing its teeth in a formidable man- 
ner.' Schoolcraft also figures a pipe of this 
type.- 

A carefully ground though unfinished pipe 
from a mound in Knox 
County, Tennessee, collected 
by Mr. Norman Spang (fig. 
168), is made of brown stone, 
its greatest length being 
2^ inches. It was evidently 
intended to be smoked by 
inserting the stem in the 
shouldered opening and hold- 
ing the pipe by its elongated 
base, as appears to have been 
done with the disk pipes. 
The stria' of the drill yet re- 
main distinct both in bowl 
%Lud stem opening. Both above and below the stem 
extension from the bowl the tool marks are quite 
distinct, the shoulders having been formed by a 
sawing process. 

Fig. 109 is a graceful pipe of the preceding form 
and is also a mound specimen from near Dubuque, 
Iowa, collected by Mr. H. T. Woodman. It is made 
of a banded green slate, the whole surface of which 
has been ground with extreme care. The incision 
on the side of the jDrolongatiou of the bowl has been 
sawed in on each side and across the end as though intended to 
represent the mouth of some animal. This belief is strengthened by 
two depressions on the point, drilled with a rough pointed tool, proba- 
bly a stone, or, if of metal, one which was quite dull, as evidenced 
by the stria', these depressions ajiparently being intended to rej^re- 
sent the nostrils.

Somewhat similar in outline, though with the position of the bowl 
reversed, is fig. 170, a pipe of steatite from Boone County, Missouri, 
collected by Mr. Charles J. Turner. It appears to be made in imitation 
of a duck's head ; the eyes are represented by shallow depressions on 
each side, the mouth being incised and following in a graceful curve 
the contour of the outline of the specimen. The slight exterior enlarge- 
ment of the end of 
what appears to be 
intended as the stem 
would indicate that 
those who made this 
pipe were familiar 
with pipes of some 
plastic material. 

In addition to the 
clay pipe with a dou- 
ble stem from Mis- 
sissippi herein re- 
ferred to, there are in the U. S. National Museum two pipes made of 
stone which have both stem and bowl duplicated. Fig. 171 is a pipe of 
this character. It is made of a gray chlorite and was found in Khea 
County, Tennessee, by Mr. A. M. Eickley. In its greatest length it 
measures 4.J inches, with a thickness of 1^ inches. Through this stone 
a hole has been drilled from side to side. There are separate bowls and 
separate stems on the opx)Osite sides of this discoidal implement. The 

bowls appear to have first been 
pecked into shape and subsequently 
reamed out about one- fourth of 
their depth, whereas the stem 
holes yet show distinctly the stria? 
of the solid drill with which they 
were made. 

Another of these double pipes 
(fig. 172) is from Columbia, South 
Carolina, collected by Mr. A. E. Crit- 
tenden. It is made of a compact 
black slate, which has a much more 
modern appearance than the pre- 
ceding pipe; besides this, the bowls 
are one above the other, and to 
smoke both at the same time could only be done by turning them on 
the side, and even in that position it would be diflBcult of accomplish- 
ment. The two heads of what appears to be a duck both point in the 
same direction and each have mouths and eyes represented, tliough, as 
so often observed in such cases, the creature is somewhat difficult to 
recognize. On the opposite side of this pipe to that shown there is in

one corner a cross in form of the swastika, and near the center the let- 
ters I N. The work on this pipe lias evidently been done with sliarp- 
edged cutting tools, and in one place the marks of a rasp or file are 
quite distinctly shown by equidistant lines of similar length. 

Prof. G. H. Perkins has illustrated a steatite pipe with two bowls 
and a single stem opening, from Swanton, in the northern ])art of Ver- 
mont, which is well polished, and is said to have been cut out instead 
of being bored, as is usual in Champlain Valley pij)es.' 

Mr. David Boyle has also described a pipe very similar to the last 
one, found in Harve^'' Township, Peterboro County, Ontario, made of 
pottery, the bowls of both of which open into each other immediately 
below the point of junction of the double bowl.^ 

The great difference in form of the double-stemmed or double-bowled 

pipe or in double jjipes of any kind 
found in America would indicate that 
they were not made according to any 
fixed rule, but rather to suit indi- 
vidual fancy; though the specimens 
described are too few to allow of posi- 
tive expression of opinion concerning 
them other than that such i^ipes have 
bowls and stems usually of modern 
form, though even this rule has its ex- 
ceptions. There is said to have been 
an old Dutch custom of smoking a 
double pipe on one's wedding day, 
which was never again used except 
upon the wedding anniversary. Two 
such i)ipes, known as Dutch bride- 
groom ])ipes, were in the celebrated 
Bragge collection, now in the British 
Museum, and are referred to as "still 
decorated with the ribbons placed upon them upon a certain festal day 
that faded into nothingness two centuries ago. The bridegroom pipe 
was one of the household gods of Holland. Smoked in augury of a 
happy future ui)on the wedding day, it was held too sacred to be 
touched again save on the recurrence of the anniversary of the mo- 
mentous event." ^ 

THE CALUMET DANCE. 

The derivation of the word '-calumet" has been discussed, yet this 
word to one at all familiar with the colonial history of the French in 
America has an especial significance and means more than a mere pipe. 
I^ constituted a peace offering combined with a flag of truce. It was sup- 
posed to secure the safety of its bearers during the function of its presen-

tation, smoking, and the attendant deliberations, and it was further said 
to protect those who carried it as far as the borders of the country of 
the people visited, though there are several references to exceptions to 
this rule. 

If the pipe tendered was accepted peace was acknowledged, while if 
the pipe was rejected it was war literally "to the knife." Warlike mes- 
sages were accompanied by red pipes; peaceful messages were accom- 
panied by pipes which were white or so colored for the occasion ; even 
the feathers decorating the pipestem had their special and separate 
significance, and strangers could tell from the shape of the pipe and 
its decorations who the people were from whence it came, and the gen- 
eral character of the mission before the messengers sjioke. The age 
of the custom can not be stated with auy degree of certainty, though 
the pipe was apj)arently used in feastiug and on solemn occasions from 
an early period. The French adopted it as an emblem of peace about 
1073, as we learn from Marquette, and later it was also employed by the 
English, until eventually it became a prevalent custom throughout the 
larger part of the continent, though the early English emblem in inter- 
course with the natives appears to have been the collar of wampum, 
which later became the wampum belt. There is reason to suppose that 
the native offering of incense to Cortez and his followers was often a 
tobacco offering of propitiation to creatures from another world, such 
as was burned to propitiate their fetiches, for tobacco and other plants, 
from a pre-Columbian era, have played an important part in the sacred 
dances of the natives, and it may be doubted whether even now he 
Indian does not connect the burning of herbs with the more mysterious 
of the affairs of life. Eventually in all transactions between the whites 
and natives a pipe was smoked ; even in social visits the Indian offered 
his pipe as a welcome, as the Ifussian or the Arab does salt. Some 
early references to smoking and other pipe customs are of more than 
passing value in the studj- of American pipes. Those quoted are given 
chronologically, beginning with Raleigh's expedition in 1580, when, 
according to Stith, "Sir Walter sent upon this voyage a domestic of 
his, one Mr. Thomas Harlot, and highly in his patron's intimacy. He 
likewise tells of the great esteem and veneration in which the natives 
held a plant, which grew spontaneously in the country, and was by 
them called tippowoc, but it is now well known by the name of tobacco; 
derived, it is said, from the island of Tobago, one of the Caribbees in 
the West Indies, where it grew in vast quantities. The leaves of this 
they cured and dried, and then being rubbed into a sort of beau and 
dust they put it into earthen tubes and drew the smoke through the 
mouth. They thought this plant of so great worth and value that even 
the gods themselves were delighted with it. And therefore they some- 
times made sacred fires and instead of a sacrifice threw in this dust, and 
when they were caught in a tempest they would sprinkle it into the air 
and water; ui^on all their new fishing nets they would cast some of it; 
and when they had escaped any remarkable danger they would throw 
some of this dust into the air, with strange distorted gestures, some- 
times striking the earth with their feet in a kind of time and measure;

sometimes clapping their bands and throwing them up on high, looking 
up to the heavens and uttering barbarous and dissonant words." ' 

This is the lirst account north of Mexico of the dance of the calumet, of 
which the French travelers so often speak, and which the Omaha and 
othertribesyetindiilgein. Accordingto llakluyt, TTariot remarks that — 
The uppowoc is of so precious estimation among them that they think 
their Gods are marvelously delighted tlierewith, whereupon they some- 
times make hallowed tires and cast some of the powder therein for a 
sacrifice; being in a storm upon the waters, to pacify their Gods, they 
cast some up into the air and into the water; so a weare for fish being 
newly set up thej' cast some therein and into the air; also after an 
escape of danger they cast some into the air likewise, but all done with 
strange gestures, stamping, sometimes dancing, clapping of hands, 
sometimes holding up of hands and staring up into the heavens utter- 
ing therewithall and chattering strange words and noises. We our- 
selves during the time we were there used to suck it after their manner, 
and also since our return, and have found many rare and wonderful 
experiments of the virtues thereof, of which the relation would require 
a volume by itself, the use of by so many of late, men and women of 
great calling and some learned Physicians, also is sufticient wituess.'- 

Capt. John Smith, a few years later (1607), speaking of the " Wero- 
wance" of "Eappahanah," says ''he caused his mat to be spread on the 
ground, where he sat down with a great majesty, taking a pipe of 
tobacco, the rest of his company standing about him," and he further 
says " there was a garden of tobacco there. * * * These people 
have a great reverence for the sun above all things, at the rising and 
the setting of the same they making a round circle on the ground with 
dried tobacco, then they began to pray.'' ' 

Somewhat after the same manner Smith, in 1008, says : " When the 
waters begin to run high they haste away to the seaside or the banks 
of the rivers, and after several invocations and outcries made, they 
throw tobacco, copper, and other trash into the water, this is in order 
to appease that power which they believe to be very angry upon such 
occasions, and must have some such oiferings made him before he will 
be quiet again." ^ 

William Strachey, in 1612, evidently referring to this paragraph, 
quaintly says : "They have also another kind of sorcery which they 
use in storms — a kind of botonomantia with herbes; when the waters 
are rough in the rivers and seacoasts their conjurers run to the waters' 
sides. After many hellish outcries they cast tobacco, copper, or such 
trash into the water to i)acify that god whom they think to be very 
angry in those storms."-^

Father White, in 1633, also refers to a function akin to tliis then 
prevailing- in Maryland. "On an ai)pointed day," lie says, "there 
assembled around a great lire all the men and women from many parts 
of the country. A space being cleaned some one produces a large bag; 
in the bag is a pipe and some powder which they call "potu." The 
pipe is such as our countrymen use for smoking, but much larger. 
Then the bag is carried around the tire, the boys and girls following 
and singing in an agreeable voice alternately, "Taho," ''Taho." The 
circle being ended the pipe is taken from the pouch with the powder. 
The powder is distributed to each of those standing around and lighted 
in the pipe, and eaeh one smoking it breathes over the several members 
of his body and consecrates them." ' 

There is in these descriptions striking similarity to the calumet 
dance later witnessed on the Mississippi by Marquette and other 
French pioneers. 

This dancing- and clapping of hands appears analogous to the prac- 
tices of the Natchez, who were said to "venerate the sun, which was 
evidenced by offerings made to it at its rising and setting; " the offici- 
ating functionary was probably a pipe chief or medicine man, such as 
have been referred to as officers of many of the tribes as far north as 
the Great Lakes. The pipe bag, pipe, and "potu" reminds one of 
customs yet kept up among the Pueblos of the Southwest. Holm, in 
his description of ISTew Sweden, says "almost all the Indians in the 
northern [)art of America make use of a token of peace and friendship 
with which they confirm all that their councils have determined upon, 
whether it be war or X3eace, or any other important business."^ 

The i^adousses, according to Eaymbault and Jogues, in 1642, were 
said to "cultivate the land after the manner of the Hurous and reaped 
corn and petnn."^ 

These people were Siouan and appear to have lived in the vicinity of 
Sault Ste. Marie, in Chippewa County, northern Michigan, and a knowl- 
edge of them at this early period would suggest an acquaintance with 
the country between Lake Erie and the southern part of Lake Michigan, 
and a propable acquaintance with the waters of the Mississippi itself 
years prior to Marquette's trip down the river in 1673. 

In 1553 the French made peace with the Iroquois at Isle Orleans, in 
the country of the Hurons, near Quebec, and in the account given of 
the proceedings by Lescarbot the Indians ai)pear to have followed a 
practice recorded on many other occasions between the natives and 
whites of dividing their speeches into parts, each part being accom- 
I>anied by separate presents, as evidenced with the French by the pipe; 
if with the English, the speeches were evidenced usually by the 
wamjiuni belt; which practice continued with slight variation to the 
period of the Revolution of the colonies.

raised himself and invoked the sun as a witness of his thoughts, as a

Sixth. To purify the stream soiled with blood.

According to I, A. Lapham "the first white persons who penetrated 
into the regions of the upper lakes were two young fur traders who left 
Montreal for that purpose in 1654 and remained two years among the 
Indian tribes on their shores. It appears that they returned with infor- 
mation-relative to Lake Superior and perhaps Lake Michigan and Green 
Bay, for in 1659 fur traders are known to have extended their traffic to 
that bay."^ 

"The Sonontonans" (Senecas, Hewitt) "to the number of fifty or 
sixty assembled in our cabins. Their custom is, on entering, to take 
the first vacant place, without regard to rank, and at once take fire for 
lighting their pipes, which are not taken from their mouths during the 
whole time of the council. They say that good thoughts come with 
smoking."^ And among the presents enumerated on the occasion were 
capots, cooking pots, beads, etc. 

At a council in the year 1670 on the shores of Lake Ontario, which 
Comte de Frontenac held with the Onondagas, Mohawks, OneidavS, 
Cayugas, and Senecas, he said : "I have lighted a fire to see you smoke 
(petuner) and to talk to you."* Among other things presented at this 
council were 25 capots.'' 

The French, after their settlement on the Ohio, sent out their fur 
traders and presumably their fur hunters, who eagerly sought for new 
fields where the game had not been thinned out and which afforded the 
most abundant supply. These traders and hunters were the first per-

sons who trod tbe soil of tliose States bordering the Great Lakes. It 
^vas probably from such persons that the Susquehannocks obtained the 
articles of European manufacture; found in their possession at the head 
of Chesapeake Bay in 1G08, probably by way of Lake Ontario and 
across from some of its afHuents down the Susquehanna. Missionaries, 
according to Caleb Atwater, " were seut to Onoudaga in 1<!54. From 
this time forward the French are known to have traversed that part of 
Ohio which borders on Lake Erie and the Oliio Kiver." ' 

The missionaries were early in the field, but it appears natural to 
suppose that they would select those territories which offered the most 
promising fields of work. This information would naturally be imparted 
by trappers and traders. Lafitau says: "Father Marquette, a Jesuit 
missionary to Canada, embarked with Sieur Joliet, a French Canadian, 
to discover the western sea and to attempt to find a way from Canada 
to China, and was the first of the French to penetrate to the Mississippi 
River. This was the 17th of June, 1673 — that is to say, six or seven 
years before La Salle went to take possession of the country in the 
King's name. They followed the Wisconsin Kiver until it fell into a 
larger river about 42^° of north latitude. They dropped with the cur- 
rent to within two or three days of the Gulf of Mexico, but noticing 
thej^ were going from their course and fearing the Spanish, returned by 
way of the Illinois to Missilimackinack " (crossing to the lake at the 
portage about Chicago). It is in the relation of the voyage of Father 
Marquette down the Mississippi that he mentions first the calumet of 
peace, and as he is the first who speaks of it, he is also the one who 
speaks best. He says : 

It was the 25th of Jiiue the ludians, having recognizefl them as Europeans, seut 
foui' old men to speak with them. Two of them carried pipes to smoke tobacco in; 
they were highly ornamented and adorned with feathers of different sorts. They 
walked solemuly and raised their pipes toward the sun; they appeared to present it 
to him to smoke without, liowever, saying a word. They were quite slow in passing 
over the short distance from the village to them. Having reached them they stopped 
and looked at them with attention. The Father, reassured by thiS ceremony, spoke 
first to them and asked who they were; to which they answered they were Illinois, 
and to guarantee peace they presented their pipes to smoke; then they invited them 
to enter their village. One should not refuse the pipe unless he would be taken for 
an enemy, but it is enongh to make out he is smoking. It is sufficient if one carries 
the calumet with him to show it, by which means he may walk in safety among 
enemies who, in the midst of fighting, will lower their arms to one who shows it. 
It was for this reason the Illinois gave this pipe as a safeguard among the nations 
through which they had to journey. There is a calumet for peace and one for war. 
They use them to end their differences, for streugthening alliances, and to communi- 
cate with strangers. 

It is made of a red stone polished like marble, and pierced so that one end serves 
to receive the tobacco, and the other has a socket for a handle, which is a stick 2 feet 
long, as large as an ordinary cane, and pierced through the middle. It is ornamented 
with the head and neck of different birds of the most beautiful plumage, to which

Americana, I, p. 116. 



552 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

they add also large red, green, and other colored feathers. They regard it as coming 
from the sun, to whom it is offered to smoke when they want calm or rain or sun- 
shine. They fear to hathe in summer or to eat new fruits without having danced to 
it as Ibllows: This calumet dance, which is very celebrated among these ijeople, is 
not performed except on serious occasions ; 8f>metime8 for making peace, or to reunite 
them for a great war, or for public rejoicing ; sometimes for a nation's assistance ; at 
times they use it at the reception of a person of considerable importance, as though 
to offer a ball or comedy. In winter the ceremony is held in a cabin ; in summer out 
in the air. The place being selected they surround it with trees, in order to shadt; 
the whole assembly. There is spread out a large mat of reeds, painted different 
colors, in the middle of the place, which serves as a carpet for the god of him who 
makes the dance; for each one has his own, which is called his Manitou. It is a ser- 
pent, or a bird, or a stone, or some similar thing of which they have dreamed and in 
which they put every confidence for success in the war or chase. Sitting near this 
Manitou and on his right is placed the calumet in honor of the one who has given 
the feast; the arms, such as clubs, hatchets, bows and (juivers, such as they use, are 
laid around it. Things being thus arranged, those having the best voices, who are to 
sing, take the most honorable place under the trees. All the world then comes aud 
take their places around them, and as each one arrives he salutes the Manitou, 
which he does in smoking and blowing the smoke upon him, as though oft'eriug 
incense. Then the one who is to commence the dance appears and goes respectfully 
and takes the pijie and holding it in both hands he dances it in rythm with the song. 
He makes it describe dift'erent figures; at times he presents it to the company and 
turns it from side to side, then he offers it to the sun as though he wished him to 
smoke it ; at others he inclines it toward the earth ; sometimes he sjireads the wings 
as though he wished it to fly; at other times he jilaces it in the mouths of the assist- 
ants that they make smoke it, all in rythm, and it is like the first scene of tbe ballet. 
The second scene they imitate a combat and go through an imaginary fight, one 
with arms and another with the calumet. The third scene is a discourse, in which 
the one Avho holds the calumet tells of his victories and it is passed from hand to 
hand until all have had a chance to smoke. ' 

These Illinois belonged to the great Algonquin linguistic stock, as 
Marquette informs us, which reached from approximately the thirty- 
fifth to the fifty-fifth degree of latitude on the east side of the Missis- 
sippi.^ The Sioux being their neighbors on the west bank of the river, 
from about latitude 33° to latitude 53°. Marquette states that these 
Illinois had never before seen Frenchmen,^ though they must have 
been quite familiar with them, as he refers to their skill in the use 
of the rifle with which they are supplied by the Indians who trade 
with the French, and which he says makes them formidable to their 
enemies.^ 

This pipe Marquette describes as being larger than the common 
tobacco pipe of the French.- It should be observed here that the Illi- 
nois pipe referred to answers fully the description of the red Siouan 
catlinite; and it is hardly possible, when we consider the minuteness of 
description of the stem and its ornamentation, that had the primitive

Illiuois pipe been carved with auimals ui^on its stein that so important 
a feature would have been passed over by Marquette ^>'ithout allusion 
to it, and as a further evidence of the curved-base mound pipe owing 
its elegance of form to European influence the lo(;ality where Marquette 
received the pipe was in the area of the mound type. 

The calumet in the dance is used to defend the bearer from the attack 
of the warrior who has taken the bow and arrow from the mat' men- 
tioned. ^Marquette refers to the Ouabouskigon liiver, which runs into 
the Mississippi from the east about latitude 36° north,- referred to in 
the text as the Ohio. Marquette was told, by the natives, of Europeans 
on the lower part of the river who lived to the east and who had images 
and chaplets and played upon musical instruments and from whom 
they bought their goods.' The pipe given to Marquette by the Illinois, 
and its value as a safeguard is referred to in a letter of November 11, 
1074, from Frontenac to Colbert.^ 

In 1G7G Father Allouez refers to the Illinois offering to him the 
calumet. '• The chief," he says, " advanced about thirty steps to 
meet me, holding in one hand a firebrand and in the other a feathered 
calumet. As he drew near he raised it to my mouth, and himself lit 
the tobacco, which obliged me to pretend to smoke." ^ 

Father Louis Hennepin refers to the calumet of peace in 1679 among 
the "Iroquese," in the vicinity of Niagara, somewhat differently from 
Marquette's allusions. The latter refers in his travels to more than 
one place where his pipe was not received. Hennepin says : " It is a 
large tobacco pipe of red, black, or white marble, with a finely polished 
head. The quill, which is commonly two foot and a half long, is made 
of a ijretty strong reed or cane adorned with feathers of all colours 
interlaced with locks of women's hair. Every nation adorns it as they 
think fit and according to the birds they have in their country. Such 
a pipe is a safe conduct amongst all the allies of the nation which has 
given it, and in all embassies the calumet is carried as a symbol of 
peace, the savages being generally persuaded that some great misfor- 
tune would befall them if they should violate the public faith of the 
calumet."' *' 

Fathers Hennepin and Gabriel in 1679 visited Niagara Falls, " the 
like whereof," Hennepin says, ''is not in the whole world."" The pipe 
is there illustrated, and if the illustration is correct, as it presumably 
is, would by its form indicate the Siouan type. 

It should be remembered that Lafitau says the Iroquois and Indians 
near Quebec and on the St. Lawrence did not use the calumet of i)eace.^ 

McCulioh is probably correct in his assertion in reference to Hen-

iiei)in's remark that in 1G79 tlie calumet was in universal use among 
the Indians east of tlie Mississippi. He says: "It is not improbable, 
however, that at that time the French traders had both greatl}^ extended 
its use and confirmed its character of conferring' ])ersonal inviolability, 
as such a practice i'avored their traflic into the interior j)arts of the 
country.'" 

Membre in 1681, in referring to La Salle's voyage to the mouth of the 
Mississippi, refers to tlie "Arkansa" and '-Taeusa" as being half civi- 
lized. The (^uinii>issa, however, when La iSalle sent messengers, let fly 
arrows at them. These jjeople, he said, had never seen guns. With the 
Mohegans also the calumet was not received. The Indians on the 
lower river told them of ])eopleto the west who rode upon animals, and 
showed them two hoofs, which were those of horses.'^ 

When they upon their return reached the Miami they learned of the 
Sieur de Tonty, who since leaving them had made several military expe- 
ditions.'' 

Baron Lahontan refers to the use of the calumet in Canada in a 
manner very similar to Marquette and La Salle, and gives some data 
which yet more strongly indicate that the calumet was of the Siouan 
type. The stem, he says, was 4 or o feet long, and the mouth or head 
in which the tobacco is held is 3 inches long, its figure approaching that 
of a hammer, the body being 8 inches long, and that the effect of the 
pipe Avas similar to that of a flag of truce with the French,* which 
strengthens the suggestion of McCulloh that this was a belief which 
the French would do everything to confirm. 

La Salle, in describing the calumet dance of the "Arkansa," gives a 
very similar account to that given by Marquette as prevailing in the 
Illinois tribe, which is quite similar to a like custom described in Vir- 
ginia, and would indicate an ancient practice. He says: "The Indians 
before dancing put poles around, as when linen is dried, and arrange 
on them all they are going to give. Then they bring two calumets 
made of red stones and filled with tobacco, being adorned with feathers 
of all colors. The chiefs and warriors have gourds full of pebbles, and 
also two drums. These are pots of earth covered with skin over the 
■top. Those who have done great deeds strike a post, which is planted 
in the middle of the council place, with a club. Having told of their 
powers, they gave M. de La Salle their presents. If anyone lies the 
one who knows it wipes the post with a skin to remove the lie. The 
French, with the exception of M. de La Salle, also struck the post and 
related their achievements."-' 

The first reference to there being any special difference in the pipes 
used at a council and those used by the individual is jnxjbably that

regarding- Garangula, an Onondaga chief, wlio in 1684 sat at council 
" with his pipe in his mouth and the great cahimet of peace before him/" 

"M. de La Barre, in conference with (iaranguhi at Kaihoga, asks him 
to smoke the cahimet and to promise, in the name of the Senecas, Cayu- 
gas, Onondagas, Mohawks, and Oneydoes, to leave the French King's 
subjects unnujlested. If they do not so agree, he says, he will declare 
Avar with them, and says this belt will confirm my words." Garangula, 
the spirited sachem who was a leader among the Onondagas and one of 
the head men of the Confederacy of the Five Nations, does not take 
kindly to the terms, which he refuses in a spirited speech. He refers 
to the calumet which the Five Nations had given the governor's prede- 
cessor, and closes by the remark: "This belt preserves my words."' •^ 

The council here referred to grew out of trade jealousies more than 
anything else, for the French were anxious to cause the Iroquois to trade 
with them rather than the English, and the language employed upon 
one side and the other was unmistakable in its significance. La Barre 
informed the Indians that the Five Nations had robbed and abused 
all the traders that were j)assing to the Illinois and to the other 
nations — children of his king. Garangula was not to be outdone in 
the force of language employed, and informed La Barre that he 
thanked him in the name of the confederated tribes for bringing back 
into their country the calumet which the predecessor of La Barre had 
received from their hands. And referring to the protection of the cal- 
umet, he informed the governor that it was happy for him "that you 
left underground that murdering hatchet."^ 

Lahontau, in 1093, referring to the Indians making peace, says: "It 
is never until after a long war that the savages try to enter into a 
treaty, but after they see it is to their interest to make peace they send 
five, ten, or twenty warriors to make peace proposals to their enemies. 
Sometimes these envoys go by land, at other times by water, carrjang 
always the great calumet of peace in the hand, after the manner of a 
cornet carrying his standard."^ 

In all treaties and councils between the whites and Indians, the pipe 
and wampum belt appear to go hand in hand. The pipe was a pre- 
requisite to all functions with the Indians, whether among themselves 
or with strangers, whereas, as has been observed, the belt was often 
the witness of the specific contract. Its bands, beads, and color, the 
very arrangement of its design, each conveyed a specific message; not 
as a hieroglyph, for symbolism in this shape does not aj^pear to have 
prevailed among the Indians using the belt, although they did at times 
resort to a rude ideography or pictography on rocks, bark, and skins; 
nor was it used as the quipu was said to be employed by the Peruvi- 
ans and which could be read by certain persons learned in the art of 
deciphering the knotted cords — an art by the way apparently not con-

made of certain shells that are found upon the seashore between I^ew

or white, and they are bored through like the pearl being run after 
the same manner upon strings which lie sideways to one another. 
Without the intervention of these coliers there is no business to be 
negotiated with the savages; for being altogether unacquainted with 
writing, they make use of them for contracts and obligations. Some- 
times they keep a belt for a generation wbicb bas been received from 
their neighbors, and, in this respect, every belt bas its own peculiar 
mark. They learn from the old persons the circumstances of the time 
and i^lace where they were delivered, but after that is over they are 
made use of for new treaties."' 

Maj. Eichard Ingoldsby, commander in chief of the province of New 
York, on the Oth of June, 1692, presented to the "sachims of the Five 
Nations or cantons westward — namely, Maquaes, Oneydes,Onnondages, 
Cayouges, and Sinnekes — in the city hall of Albany, G gross of pipes 
and 100 pounds of tobacco." ^ 

Sanvole, in Louisiana, in 1090, speaks of giving the Indians small 
presents of glass beads, knives, and hatchets, for conducting M. De 
Bienville to the Equinipicbas (Choctaws living northeast of the mouth 
of the Mississippi) to whom be also sent a present of a cai)ot, a calumet, 
beads, and other things proper to give such persons.' 

Tbis i)resent, the capot, is not an uncommon occurrence apparently, 
and the same author refers to a present of a " habit rouge " and the 
calumet of i^eace. ^ 

Father Gravier, who, in 1701, went over the same ground that Father 
Marquette had traversed in 1G73, refers to the calumet and there being 
one for peace and another for war, the red signifying war. He goes so 
far as to say that upon presentation of the calumet even enemies will lay 
down their arms in the beat of combat. He describes the hollow wooden 
stem of the pipe as being the origin of the name calumet from a cor- 
ruption of the word chalumeau, because it resembles a pipe or rather a 
long flute.-' 

That there were exceptions, however, to the sanctity of the calumet

of peace is evidenced by P>ernjird de la Harpe, who records the break- 
ing of the arm of Charles, the Canadian, in January, 1703, by a party 
of Indians who had presented the cahiinet, and the same night assassi- 
nated his (iompanions.' The singing of the song of the calumet was 
not conrtued to the natives by any means, for in this they were imi- 
tated by the French^ on more than one occasion. 

Du Pratz, in his history of Louisiana, illustrates the manner of dan- 
cing the calumet on the Lower Mississii)pi in 1719 by the Tchitima- 
chas (fig. 173). 

He says: "1 had an opportunity during this trip to satisfy my curi- 
osity on the subject of the calumet 
of peace, of which I had heard so 
much from the old Frencii inhabit- 
ants. There having been war with 
the Tchitimachas (a distinct linguis- 
tic stock located west of the mouth 
of the Mississippi), they asked for 
peace. A delegation arrived sing- 
ing the calumet song, and with the 
calumet moving in rhythm they ad- 
vanced, keeping time to the sound 
of the rattle."-^ 

"The calumet," he says, "is the 
tube of a pipe at least 1^ feet long, 
covered with a skin composed of 
the head and neck of a wood duck, 
of which the uumy-colored plu- 
mage is exceedingly attractive, and 
at the end of the tube there is a 
pipe. At the same end there is 
fixed a kind of wing of the white 
eagle, in shape of a quarter circle, 
and at the end of each feather it is 
encircled by a hoop dyed a bright 
red color, while the other end has 
none."-' After a brief descrii)tion 
of the i^reliminaries, he says: 
"The speaker stood up while the assistant filled the pipe, and after 
smoking it, he dried it, and handed it to Mr. Bienville to do the same; 
then we all smoked it, after which the old man took the calumet and 
gave it to Mr. Bienville to keep."* On these occasions, he says, "they 
are dressed in their best, and never fail to hold in their hand a chichi- 
cois" (rattle), "which they also move in rhythm."^ "The war calumet," 
he says, "is a pipe of the same material and shape excepting the color 
of the feathers, which are those of an aquatic bird, the flamingo. The

head of the bird is skinned, the feathers being of a whitish gray, which 
being dyed, only makes a light red, the hoop and tufts being black. 
The stem of the pipe is covered with the skin of a carancro" (carrion 
crow?), "as black as a blackbird and as big as a turkey.'" 

There is difficulty in defining the word "carancro," unless it be a 
corruption of the English "carrion crow," though probably either the 
turkey, vulture, or black vulture is intended, as both are common in 
Louisiana; both are black and botli are about the size of a turkey. 

Charlevoix, in 1721, among the Onondagas, says there is perhaps no 
example of an agreement entered into after smoking the calumet ever 
being violated, but asserts that if it be presented in the midst of a 
battle by an enemy it may be refused. He describes the war calumet 
as being all red, or red on one side, and says that from the manner in 
which the feathers are arranged they know at sight the nation to 
which it belongs.^ 

Of wampum Charlevoix says that these shells were of two colors, 
from which the belts were made, and that the red ones were frequently 
sent when war was intended; and in reference to the red and white 
colors signifying war or peace, suggests that they have taken the hint 
from the colors of the English and the French. " It is even said," he 
remarks, "that we ourselves first introduced it amongst them."^ 

This author's explanation of the calumet differs somewhat from that 
generally suggested. He says : " The calumet is no less sacred among 
the Indians than the collar of wampum; it is even, if we believe them, 
of divine origin, for they maintain it was a i)resent made them by the 
sun. It is more in use among the southern and western nations than 
among the eastern and northern, and is more frequently employed for 
peace than for war. Calumet is a iJTorman word, being a corru])tion of 
chaliorveau, and the calumet of the Indian is properly the stalk of the 
pipe, but under that name is understood the whole pipe as well as the 
stalk. The stalk is very long in calumets of ceremony, and the pipe 
has the shape of our old hammers for arms. It is commonly made of 
a sort of reddish marble, very easy to work, and found in the country 
of the Aiouez [lowas, Sioux], beyond the Mississippi. The stalk is of 
a light wood, i)ainted with different colors, and adorned with the heads, 
tails, and feathers of the most beautiful birds, which in all probability 
is only intended for ornament." ^ 

That calumet customs were similar throughout a great part of the 
north and west there is abundant evidence, and the i)ractice pro\ailed 
even as far south as Virginia. Robert Beverly, in 1722, enumerates 
five things which were always observed in receiving strangers, in 
order to determine whether they came on a peaceful or on a warlike 
mission.

" First. They take a pipe much larger and higgler than the common 
tobacco pipe, expressly made for the j)urpose, with which all towns are 
provided. 

Second. This pipe they always fill before the fiice of the strangers, 
and light it. 

Third. The chief man of the Indians takes two or three whiffs and 
hands it to the chief of the strangers. 

Fourth. If the strangers refuse it, it is a sign of war. 

Fifth. It it be peace, the stranger takes a whiff or two and hands it to 
the next great man of the town they come to visit; he after taking two or 
three whiffs gives it back to the next of the strangers, and so on alter- 
natel}' until they have passed it to all i)ersous of note on each side, and 
then the ceremony is ended." ' 

In i!^ew York the calumet was used at a council in Albany, May 30, 
1723.2 

Cadwalader Golden, in 1724, speaks of the calumet being used by the 
Five j!!^ations, and says it was used by the Indians before they knew any- 
thing of the Christians, and is at a loss to know how they were pierced 
aiul shai)ed before they had the use of iron.^ 

Father J. F. Lafltau, whose great work on the American Indians was 
published in 1724, refers to the Sioux having endeavored to fool a 
French oflicer by presenting him a dozen calumets. One of his Indians 
to whom he showed them called his attention to the fact that one of 
them was not twisted with hair, as the others were, and had besides 
engraved on its handle a snake, and assured him it was a sign of 
treason. But, he says, " they tell me it is a greater sign of war when 
they paint the handle red between the hairs.*' The Europeans, he says, 
"up to the present time, who have traded with the Illinois and the 
other people of Louisiana have used the caluuiet and have participated 
in all its ceremonies iu order to obtain liberty to pass in peace in their 
commercial transactions." He " sees in the custom remains of paganism 
and a marked idolatry," and thinks "it should be abolished entirely 
among the Europeans and nations who have embraced or who may want 
to embrace Christianity." * 

That the sanctity of the calumet was not always respected there can 
be no doubt, even along the Mississippi, where instances have been cited 
of refusal even to communicate with those carrying a calumet. Latitau 
says that if in council between ambassadors and the Indians concern- 
ing the making of peace the council decides ui)on war it is a great mis- 
fortune for the ambassadors, for the law in that case only protects them 
as long as the matter is iu abeyance, but being negatived they knock 
them in the head where they are, though they often take honorable 
leave of them and then send and have them assassinated a few days

march from the village. He remarks that it is not customary to burn 
or make slaves of ambassadors, though the Iroquois burned some of 
those accompanying tlie Chevalier d'(3, whom the Comte de Frontenac 
had sent to them, and would have burned him if he had not taken 
refuge among the English. The law of nations, he says, is more 
respected among the nations living in Louisiana along the borders of 
the Mississippi, who observe the custom of the calumet, which the Iro- 
quois have not, nor have the natives near Quebec and on the lower St. 
Lawrence.' 

Lafltau lived many years among these people, from 1712 on. He 
studied their character and was thoroughly acquainted with them, 
though his reference is probably to the dance as a Siouan function 
rather than that of other tribes, tlie pipe offering became common 
eventually between the whites and natives throughout the country 
and acted as a truce. Lafitau refers to the details of a religious dance 
witnessed by Le Sieur de Leri among the Caribs about this period, 
which appears to have been similar to the calumet dance of the Sioux. 
"These Caribs," he says, "in advancing and jumping forward and 
retreating, took a stick about 4 or 5 feet long, at the end of which they 
had the dry herb petun, and lighted it, turning around and blowing 
the smoke on all the other savages.'' ^ 

Lionel Wafer describes a most peculiar and unique method of smoking 
in 1G80 that was indulged in by the natives of the Isthmus. The dried 
tobacco leaves were "stripped from the stalk, and laying two or three 
leaves upon one another they roll all up sideways in a long roll, yet 
leaving a little hollow; round this they roll other leaves one after 
another in the same manner, but close and hard, till the roll is as big 
as one's wrist and 2 or 3 feet in length. Their way of smoking when 
they are in company together is thus: A boy lights one end of a roll 
and burns it to a coal, wetting the part next to it to keep it from wast- 
ing too fast; the end so lighted he puts into his mouth, and blows the 
smoke through the whole length of the roll into the face of every one 
of the company or council, though there be two or three hundred of 
them. Then they, sitting in their usual posture upon forms, make 
with their hands held together a kind of funnel around their mouths 
and noses; into this they receive the smoke as it is blown upon them, 
snufling it up greedily and strongly, as long as ever they are able to 
hold their breath, and seeming to bless themselves as it were with the 
refreshment it gives them." ' 

To return however to the calumet. One of the early accounts of the 
locality from whence the red pipestone was derived is recorded by Du 
Pratz and vouched for by oflticers of the expedition made by Le 
Bourgmont to the Padoucas, yet will likely be read with incredulity. 
"That there was," he says, "a high bluff in which was a mass of red stone 
flecked with white, like porphyry, with this difference, that this of which

we speak is almost as soft as tufa. It is covered with anotlier stone 
which has no jnerit. The natives who knew its worth endeavored to 
cut it with blows from their arrows, and when pieces dropped into the 
water, they found it by diving. When they got a piece large enough 
from which to make a calumet, they made it by means of a knife and 
awl. The stone works easily and resists a hot ftre." ' 

This description answers correctly the characteristics of catlinite and 
its bed, which lies between layers of quartzite at Couteau des Prairies. 
This red stone, often spoken of by early writers as a red marble, has a 
brilliant color and is susceptible of a high polish, and there is evidence 
in the primitive burials of a large area that from an early period there 
was an extensive trade in it. Though there does not appear ever to 
have been such distribution of other pipes as there was of those made of 
clay such as were used by the English who, on July 0, 1742, in the meet- 
inghouse in Philadelphia at a council held by Lieut. Governor George 
Thomas and certain gentlemen with Onontogoes, Caiyoquos, Oneidas, 
Senecas, Tuscaroros, Shawanoes, Canestogas, etc., gave away 1,000 to- 
bacco pipes, 200 pounds of tobacco, and 100 tobacco tongs, this gift being 
duplicated for the land on the east side of the Susquehanna Piver.-' 

The ceremony of intertribal smoking in the manner related is said 
to have occurred during the governorship of the Hon. George Clinton 
on July 8, 1751, between the Catawbas and the Six Nations in Albany, 
New York. ''The Catawbas came down from their quarters singing, 
with their colors pointed to the ground, and having lit their i)ipes, the 
king and one more put them in the mouths of the chief sachems of the 
Six Nations who smolvcd out of them. The chief sachem of the Senecas 
lit a pipe and put it in the mouths of each of the Catawbas, who smoked 
out of it and then he returned it among the Six Nations.* 

Woodrow Wilson gives a good description of the conditions existing 
between the French and the English in 1751-1753: "The strength of 
the French lay in their command of the water courses which flanked 
the English colonies both north and west, from the Gulf of St. Lawrence 
to the mouths of the Mississippi. There were French posts at Niagara 
and Crown Point on Lake Champlain, and English posts were at 
Oswego and on the Hudson. The English were pressing toward the 
western mountains and down into Virginia to the Shenandoah Valley; 
quite three hundred traders went into Ohio every year. Du Quesne 
established Pres(iue Isle in 1753. Washington, sent by Governor 
Dinwiddie, met the French at Fort Le Boeuf, warning them to leave 
the country, and returned January, 1751. The French established 
Fort Du Quesne in 1751, Washington being defeated at Great Meadows. 
Braddock made his campaign in 1V55 against Du Quesne and was 
badly defeated." * 

Sir William Johnson at a meeting with the Six Nations on February 
23, 175G, gave them the largest pipe in America, made on purpose, and

said to them : " Take this pipe to your great council chamber at Onon- 
daga: let it hang there in view, and should you be wavering in your 
minds at any time, take and smoke out of it, and think of my advice 
given with it, and you will recover and think properlj,"' and on July 
23, 1756, in the proceedings of a council with " Pondiac" and chiefs of 
the Ottawas, Pontawattamies, llurons, and Chii)pewas, tlie chiefs 
being all seated. Sir AVilliam Johnson caused Poiidiac's pipe to be 
lighted, which, after being handed around by the interpreter to all 
l^resent, he addressed them.- 

" On September 19, of the same year, at Fort Johnson, ]S"ew York, 
the Mohawks of both Castles, the Oueidas, the Cayougas, and two 
Seneca sachems with the River Indians met in council, and sent to 
acquaint Sir William that they proposed to deliver the message agreed 
upon on the 18th to the Cherokee deputies. When Sir William came 
in and all were seated, the four Cherokees were introduced to the coun- 
cil by Captain Montour, and taking seats in four chairs placed pur- 
posely for them. Sir William lighted the calumet, or pipe of i^eace and 
friendship, and after smoking a whiff presented it to the four Cherokee 
deputies, holding it to them while each drew a whiflf, then the gentle- 
men present took it and Mr. Montour handed it round to every Indian 
present. The tobacco from whence it was tilled was then put into a 
bag to be carried home with the calumet by the Cherokees,"^ as show- 
ing the then existing international jealousies. A desire was expressed 
at thi& meeting to keep a knowledge of it from the French, 

Jonathan Carver, who in 1763 endeavored to cross the continent and 
to acquaint the world with the geography of the interior of the country 
and the lands acquired after the peace of 1763, says: "I knew that 
many obstructions would arise in my scheme from the want of good 
maps and charts ; for the French while they retained their power in 
North America had taken every artful method to keep all other 
nations, particularly the English, in ignorance of the concerns of the 
interior parts of it, and to accomplish this design with greater certainty 
they had published inaccurate maps and false accounts."^ 

Robert Rogers says : " When they use collars or belts of wampum, it 
must be a matter of national importance." 

He refers also to the customs of the natives, and also to the calumet 
of peace as being of no less importance in many transactions — "rela- 
tive to war and peace. The bowl of this pipe is made of a soft red 
stone, which is easily wrought and hollowed out; the stem is of cane, 
elder, or some light wood, painted with different colors, and decorated 
with the heads, tails, and feathers of the most beautiful birds. The 
use of the calumet is to smoke either tobacco or some bark, leaf, or

herb, wliich tliey often use iustead of it, wlieu they enter into an alli- 
ance. When they treat of war the whole pipe and ornaments are red. 
Sometimes it is red only on one side, and by the disposition of the 
feathers, etc., one acquainted with their customs will know after first 
siglit what the native who presents it intends or desires. Smoking the 
calumet is also a religious ceremony ux)on some occasions, and in all 
treaties is considered as a witness between the parties.'" 

"On July 1, ITG,"), a Frenchman arrived'' in the colony of ISTew York 
" from the Illinois with a pipe and speech from thence to the Kick- 
apoos and Mosquattamis. * * * Then they spoke on several pipes 
and belts. Pondiac (Algonquin) gave a large pipe with a belt of 
wampum tied to it.'"' 

In ITGO "the Onondaga speaker lighted a calumet of peace which 
Sir Wilham (Johnson) left in their hands many j'ears ago for that use, 
and handed it to the western Indians, after which the speaker, with a 
bunch of wampum, addressed himself to the western nations."^ This 
pipe was probably the same one referred to as presented to the Indians 
on February 23, 1756. 

Carver also describes the calumet and its decorations, but adds 
nothing to the description of its appearance beyond what has already 
been set forth. lie refers to the diflerent methods employed in deco- 
rating the calumet and the fact of the Indians' ability to tell at first sight 
to what tribe it belongs. He is more explicit, however, in describing the 
ceremony of the smoke. "The assistant or aid-de-camp of the great 
warrior, when the chiefs are assembled and seated, fills the pipe with 
tobacco mixed with herbs, taking care at the same time that no part of 
it touches the ground. When it is filled he takes a coal that is thor- 
oughly kindled from a fire which is generally kept burning in the midst 
of the assembly and places it on the tobacco." Having done so, "he 
presents it to the hereditary chief, who, having taken two or three 
whiffs, blows the smoke from his moutli, first toward heaven and then 
around him upon the ground."^ It is then presented to the others of 
the council by the bearer, and they only touch it with their lips. 

Eeferring to the Southern tribes, the Talapouches and Alibamons, 
Bossu, in 1768, speaking of their meeting persons, says when you land 
they give you the hand in presenting the calumet, and when you have 
smoked they ask the subject of your travels.'' 

The head priest, he says, "with a dignified step, daily went forward 
before the sun rose with the calumet in his hand and blew the first 
mouthful of smoke toward it.'"* The equipment of these Indians for war 
was of the simplest character — "a bearskin for abed, a beef [buffalo ?j skin

for covering, a wild-cat skin to bold the calumet, and a club or small 
ax for making- their cabins/" 

The " Akan<;as" received Bossu with the calumet dance, first having 
tattooed him; he thereafter smoked the calumet' as though tattooing 
was a prerequisite or initiation to the pipe ceremony. In referring to the 
drowning of several soldiers he says he also would have met the same 
fate had it not have been for a generous "Akan<^'as," who, without fear- 
ing the rigor of the weather, jumped into the water and pulled him out 
by his capot, "a linen garment of travelers resembling a capuchon."^ 

One can with difticulty refrain from laughing at Bossu's description 
of the function of the calumet dance given by the Missouri Indians 
after their return from a raid to the southwest, where they had literally 
cleaned out a Spanish mission and probably killed all those guarding it. 
He says; "They brought here the ornaments of the chapel, in which they 
were dressed. The chief wore over his skin the best chasuble, having 
the patin hanging from his neck pierced by a nail and answering the 
purpose of a gorget; lie marched at the head of the jirocession, having 
on his head a feather bonnet and pair of horns ; he was followed by others 
wearing stoles and maniples around their necks. Following these 
were tliree or four savages clothed in surplices. The acolytes, contrary 
to usage, marched at the tail of the procession, and not finding them- 
selves sufficiently decorated, danced forward in step, holding either a 
cross or a chandelier in their hands. Not appreciating the value of 
sacred vessels, they had hung a chalice at a horse's neck, on the 
principle of a bell. Imagine the ridiculous spectacle witnessed by the 
order of this queer procession arriving at the house of M. Boisbriant, 
lieutenant of the King, marching in step, with the great calumet of 
peace solemnly carried in front." * 

Albert James Pickett informs us that ''the grand chief of the 
Natchez bore the name of the sun. Every morning as soon as that lumi- 
nary appeared he stood at the door of his cabin, turned his face 
toward the east and bowed three times, at the same time prostrating 
himself to the ground. A pipe, which was never used but upon this 
occasion, was then handed to him, from which he puffed smoke, first 
toward the sun and then toward the other three quarters of the world."^ 

Ulloa says that among the natives of Peru the use of tobacco was 
very moderate, and that the people of the more elevated regions do 
not smoke. In some of the lower parts of the country, where the 
natives do use it, he says, "It is astonishing that tobacco, a product of 
these countries, has not a more extended use among the Indians, con- 
sidering it has become so necessary in Europe."" 

He thinks that the offering of the pipe to visitors was similar to that 
indulged in among Orientals, accompanying it with coffee and other 
drinks, which were similar to the Indian customs of hospitality with

the pipe, and indicates a common origin, no matter how far back from 
our time. The shape of pipe bowls and of stems also differ from the 
shape of the European pipe. He thinks the use of tobacco was not 
introduced into Europe by the discovery of America.' 

Among- the Southern Indians Pickett speaks of the " council house 
where the inhabitants were accustomed to take the black drink. When 
the drinking began tobacco contained in poaches nmde from the skins 
of the wild-cat, otter, bear, or rattlesnake was distributed among the 
assembly, together with pipes, and a general smoking began. The 
king began first with a few whifts from the great pipe, blowing it cere- 
moniously first toward the sun, next toward the four cardinal i)oiuts, 
and then toward the white audieuce ; theu the attendants passed the 
pipe to others of distinction."^ 

We see here a reference to the general aboriginal belief in the six 
quarters of the universe, the above and the below, in addition to the 
four cardinal points, or the four winds, all being equally important, 
according to })rimitive ideas. William Bartram refers to smoking with 
a chief a pipe, the " stem of which was about 4 feet long and was 
sheathed in a beautiful speckled snake's skin, adorned with feathers 
and strings of wampum.''^ 

An early reference to the calumet custom is the quaint description 
given by John Filson in his History of Kentucky, as translated by 
Parrand, of a meeting held at Fort St. Vincent, April 15, 1784, between 
Thomas J. Dalton, who said to the Piankashaws, "The white men — 
Americans, French, Spanish, Dutch, and English — smoke the pipe of 
peace; the tomahawk is buried, and we are now all friends. In eighteen 
days I quit the Wabash to see my big chief at the falls of the Ohio. 
Here is tobacco that I give you; smoke it, and consider what you will 
do." Then he gave a collar of wampum, blue and white, and said, 
"Piankashaw, talk; talk to the Americans." The chief of the Piank- 
ashaws said : " We accept your wampum belt. We accepted the toma- 
hawk of the English. We smoke, as brothers, the peace pipe which we 
give you. See, O father, the pix)e which gives us joy. Smoke it your- 
self Our warriors are pleased that we give it to you. We smoke 
your pii)e." He closes his oration in a somewhat startling manner, 
however, saying, " We ask of you a little taste of your milk, that our 
warriors may see it comes from your breast. We are born and raised in 
the woods and can never learn to make rum. God made the white man 
master of the world. They make everything; and all of us love rum."^ 

In 1789 Georg Ileinrich Loskiel speaks of the peace pipe, or calumet, 
as it was called by the French, as having a head of red marble, the red 
of which is a sign of blood, which they would not send as a peace 
emblem, but cover it over with white clay or chalk. This pipe was 6 or

8 inches long and 3 inches high, its stem being 4 feet long, with a pretty- 
band wound around it, with porcupine quills and white corals worked 
into the band, in which latter work the women endeavor to show 
their skill.' The people of whom he spoke were the Delawares and 
Iroquois. 

In the extreme northwest of the continent, Mackenzie, in 1792, gave 
the natives of the l*eace Kiver a pipe as a token of peace, just as all his 
predecessors had done throughout the continent for one hundred and 
fifty or more years.- He also informs us that among the Crees even the . 
funeral rights begin with smoking, as do all other solemn ceremonies, 
and conclude with a feast. ' 

Mackenzie says a contract which is solemnized by the ceremony of 
smoking never fails of being faithfully fulfilled, and if a person previous 
to going on a journey leaves the sacred stem as a pledge of his return, 
no consideration whatever will prevent him executing his engagement.^ 

One of the most careful and particular accounts of Indian smok- 
ing which has come down to us; is that of Mackenzie describing its 
practice among the Kinsteneaax. He says: ''The owner of the dwell- 
ing opens his medicine bag, which contains a piece of Brazil tobacco, 
several roots and simples, which are in great estimation, and a pipe. 
These articles being exposed and the stem resting upon two forks, as 
it must not touch the ground, the master of the lodge sends for the 
person he most esteems, who sits down opjiosite to him. The pipe is 
then filled and fixed to the stem. A pair of wooden pincers are provided 
to put the fire in the pipe, and a double-pointed pin to emi^ty it of the 
remains of tobacco which is not consumed. This arrangement being 
made, the men assemble and sometimes the women are allowed to be 
humble spectators, while the most religious awe and solemnity per- 
vades the whole. The assistant takes up the pipe and presents it to 
the officiating person, who receives it standing, and holds it between 
both his hands. He then turns himself to the east and draws a few 
whiffs, which he blows to that point; the same ceremony he observes 
to the other three (juarters, with his eyes directed upward through the 
whole of it; he holds the stem about the middle, between the three 
first fingers of both hands, and raising them upon a line with his fore- 
head he swings it three times around with the sun, when, after pointing 
it and balancing it in various directions, he reposes it on the forks. 
The assistant then takes up the pipe and holds it to the north of the 
oflQciating person, who, after smoking three whift's out of it, utters 
a short iH'ayer, and then goes around with it, taking his course from 
the east to west, to every person present, who individually says some- 
thing to him on the occasion, and thus the pipe is generally smoked 
out. After turning it three or four times around his head he drops it 
downward and replaces it in its original situation."''

AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 567 

Lewis and Clarke, iu 1804, iu tlieir expedition up the IMissouii after 
the acquisitiou of Louisiaua, record a peculiar custom among- the Sho- 
shones, who take ofl' their moccasins before smoking with strangers.^ 
These oflicers were the first ones who presented the fiag as an emblem 
of peace to this tribe.' The leaders of this expedition in their journey 
up the IMissouri smoked the pipe of peace with the Tetons (Sioux), and 
in describing the pipe raised on forked sticks, say: "The down of 
swan Avas scattered under it. They first pointed the pipe toward 
heaven aiul then to the four quarters of the globe, then to the earth, 
made a short speech, lighted the pipe, and presented it to us."^ They 
feasted with the Indians and describe their meals, which were scant at 
times, though dog api^ears to have been a popular and common dish 
during a great jjart of the journey. 

Sir John Franklin, on a journey to the Polar Sea in 1820, refers to 
the Cree customs being similar to those recounted of them by Lewis 
and Clarke, though he says the bearberry was mixed with tobacco; 
the one smoking passing the pipe to his left-hand neighbor, and when it 
reached Franklin and his interpreter who were seated at the door, they 
were requested to keep the head of the calumet within the threshold.^ 

John I). Hunter, who lived numy years as a prisoner among the 
Kickapoo who had captured him, and who subsequently lived with the 
Kansas and the Osages, refers to the men often amusing themselves 
by "making bowls and pipes of clay for their individual use, which are 
burned."^ "The eldest person always enters a council lodge first, and 
is followed by the other counselors much according to seniority in the 
most perfect order. They then seat themselves cross-legged on mats, 
which are arranged circularly around the lodge for the purpose. The 
chief then lights tiie national pipe, takes three whiSs, passes it after 
smoking to the next greatest person present, and then it is passed 
around in the midst of the most perfect silence.'"^ If embassies 
arrive they are given the most honorable position in the lodge, and 
after the ceremony of smoking they unfold their mission." 

The Eev. J. Owen Dorsey records an act of worshii) among the Sioux 
which, he says, is of daily occurrence when one is about to smoke his 
pipe. "He looks to the sky and says 'Wakanta, here is tobacco,' 
Then he putts a mouthful of smoke up to the sky, after which he smokes 
as he pleases." They also make ofterings of tobacco by throwing a 
small (quantity in the fire." Mr. Dorsey refers to the Shoshoni chief 
with whom Cai)tain Lewis smoked, lighting his pipe of transi)arent

green stone.' They smoked towards the invoked object and placed gifts 
of killickinnick upon it.- They presented the pipe with the mouthpiece 
toward the power invoked. The Omaha and Ponka used to hold the 
pipe in six directions while smoking toward the four winds, the ground, 
and the ujiper world.' 

Certain persons have care of each the peace and the war pipe among 
the Omaha, and there are others who are designated to light the pipe. 
Certain words must at times be used in taking out the i)ipes; if not 
followed, misfortune overtakes the delinquent. If the proper parties 
are not jiresent ceremonies must often be delayed. To learn the laws 
of the pipe takes four days."* 

The importance of clie presentation of the pipe with all due ceremony 
extends among the Omaha to the bufilalo or other game, according to 
Stephen H. Long, who says: "The party having approached as near 
the herd as they suppose the animals will permit without taking alarm, 
they halt to give the pipe bearer an opportunity to perform the cere- 
mony of smoking, which is considered necessary to their success. He 
lights his pipe and remains a short time with his head inclined. The 
stem of the pipe extends toward the herd. He then smokes and pufl's 
the smoke toward the bisons, toward the heavens, the earth, and finally 
to the cardinal points successively. These last are designated by the 
terms sunrise, sunset, cold country, and warm country, or they desig- 
nate them collectively by the phrase of the four winds, Ta-da-sa-ga- 
to-ba."^ 

The pipes are cut, he says, from the red, indurated clay which 
they procure from the pipestone branch of the Sioux Eiver, the mass 
being readily cut with a common knife.'' 

One of the most minute descriptions of the calumet dance which the 
writer is conversant with, is that of Major Stephen H. Long, referring 
to the Omaha who belong to the great Siouau family. He says: 

The calumet dance, Nin-ne-na-ba-wong, is a favoiiie dance. It is usually ])er- 
foriiH'cl by two individuals, in honor and in the presence of one of their own or of a 
neighborinj^ nation in the expectation of receivingpresents in return. A person who 
intends to perform this dance sends a messenger, bearing a small sl^in containing 
tobacco to fill a pipe, to the individual whom he intends to honor. If the proposed 
compliment should not l)e acceptable, it is refused in tht^ most courteous manner, 
■with excuses based upon poverty and with many thauks for the honor intended. If, 
on the contrary, the tobacco should be accepted .and smoked, the act shows that the 
visit also will be acceptable, and a time is fixed for the performance of the ceremony. 
At the appointed time the dancers, with two selected companions, repair to the place 
of their destination and are invited into the lodge of the person addressed. After a 
short time a calumet is placed upon a forked support, which is driven into the soil

in the back part of the lodge. Notice is then given to the bi.irer of the calumet 
respecting the time when it will be convenient for the danee to take place. The 
bearer of the calumet is now considered as the father, and addresses the individual 
whom he is about to honor by the title of son, presenting him with some valuable 
articles, such as a gun, kettle, blankets, clothing, and ornaments for his youngest 
child, who is destined to represent the father, or the adopted son, at the ensuing 
ceremony. 

At sunset the calumet is taken from the forked stick, or support, enveloped like 
an infant in swaddling clothes, and pla( ed carefully in a bed prepared for its recep- 
tion ; a lullaby is then sung, ac<ora])anied by the music of the rattle, for its (juiet 
repose. On the following morning it is awakened by a song, with the same music, 
and again consigned to its forked sui)])ort. The appointed day having arrived, a 
space of sufficient diameter is inclosed by a screen of skins lor the dance; a post is 
fixed in the earth, near tlie entrance to the area. Around this area the principal 
men of the nation seat themselves; the adopted son leads in his youthful represent- 
ative, and the two dancers, decorated with i>aint and entirely destitute of clothing, 
with the exception of the breech-cloth, conmu-nce the dance. They are each provided 
with a decorated calumet stem and a rattle of dried skin or a gourd, containing 
pebbles, with which to keep time with the music of the gong and to the vocal chant- 
ing of the musicians of the village. They dance in the ordinary manner of the 
Indians and pass backward and forward between the entrance and back part of 
the area, endeavoring to exhiliit as much agility as possible in their movements, 
throwing themselves into a great variety of attitudes, imitative of the actions 
of the war eagle, preserving at the same time a constant waving motion, with 
the calumet in the left hand and agitating the gourd in the right, more or less 
vehemently, agreeably to the music. "Warriors and braves will now bring forth 
presents of horses, guns, etc. The bridle of the horse is attached to the post by 
the donor, who receives the thanks of an old crier stationed there to perform that 
duty. The music now ceases while the donor strikes the post and recounts his 
nnirtial deeds, and boasts of the presents which he has made at different times 
on similar occasions. Sometimes during a ceremony a warrior will take the gong 
from the performer and strike upon it as many times as he has achieved brave and 
generous actions; he then sits down, and no cme must dare touch it but such as can 
strike it more frequently than the first; if this is done the gong is returned to the 
performer. The calumet dance sometimes continues two or three days, but each 
night the calumet is consigned to its repose in the bed with the same ceremonies 
as the first night. When all the presents have been made which the dancers have 
reason to expect, they depart immediately with them to their own nation or lodge. 
Instead of striking the post the donors sometimes strike lightly upon the persons of 
the dancers. The presents made at these dances are sometimes quite considerable. 
Ong ])atunga once danced tbe calumet to Tanarecawaho, the grand Pawnee chief, 
and received from him between eighty and ninety horses. The Pawnees are. indeed, 
distinguished for their liberality and dexterity at this ceremtmy. They gave one 
hundred and forty last autumn to the Otoes who performed this dance at their vil- 
lage, and gave so much satisfaction to many individuals of this naticm as to receive 
extraordinary presents from them. On this occasion one person, in the warmth of 
his feelings, brought forth his child and presented it to them as the most precious 
gift in his power to bestow. The Pawnees accepted this gift, but on their departure 
they returned the child to its parents, accompanied by the present of a fine horse, 
upon which it was mounted.'

many of the Pueblos, Xavajos, Apaches, aud Sioux, iu smokiug, pass

the pipe to the left of the one smoking'; at times it is passed from the 
smoker back to the ofticiating chief, when he passes it to his right, but 
to the left of the smoker. The significance is that it must go with 
the sun. 

Maximilian von Wied, in referring to the Blackfeet, says: "If you 
visit an Indian in his tent, the pipe is immediately taken, which in com- 
l)any is generally circulated to the left. The owner of the house often 
blows the smoke to the sun, then to the earth. One takes a few wliifts 
and passes it on. The smoke is drawn right into the lungs. The last 
smoker never i)asses it back, but gives it to the one sitting in the row 
opposite to him and it goes again to the left."^ 

Father P. J. De Smet refers to the calumet customs as they existed 
in 1841 among the "Pottawatomies or Northern Nations (Algonciuins), 
its sacredness, its colors, feathers, and always being part of all religious 
ceremonies." ^ 

Catlin, in one of his descriptions, says the pipe is ornamented with 
tlie quills of the war eagle and wrapjied in many bandages, and is 
only used in making treaties.^ He says, concerning the smoking of the 
Sioux: "In their native state they are excessive smokers and would 
seem to be smoking one-half of their lives. There are many weeds 
and leaves and barks of trees which the Indians dry and pulverize 
and carry in pouches and smoke to great excess, and in several of 
the languages when thus prepared is called k'nick k'neck."^ 

Miss Alice Fletcher informs the writer that among the Dakotas and 
Sioux the pipe is an implement of ceremony, and so employed ; and that 
for all ceremony the pipe is prominent. The Moki, Dr. J. W. Fewkes 
informs the writer, use different herbs in their ceremonies, at times as 
many as six. Having given a chief some spruce from near Santa Fe, 
New Mexico, the latter said it was good for the pipe, because it was the 
most eastern place he knew, and they desired herbs from as great dis- 
tances as possible from each of the four world quarters, as it made the 
best medicine. Ordinarily they smoke Nicotiana attenuata, but in for- 
mal smoking they use no manufactured American tobacco. The pipe 
bearer lights the pipe with a corncob and carries it in both hands with 
the bowl down and away from him ; he hands it to the chief, who smokes 
six whiffs to the north, west, south, and east, then up and down on 
the altar. The dhief then hands the pipe to the one on the left. The 
last man in the row hands it back to the pi[)e bearer. If there is a 
second line of persons on the opposite side of the altar, the pipe bearer 
smokes and i)asses it to his right; but it must be another pi])e. The 
above refers to a ceremonial smoke. There is one head chief; the pipe

bearer is the next to this chief in dignity. The pipe used in the first 
eight songs of the sixteen-song dance is of the rectangular character, 
and appears to be of no special significance, but in the middle of the 
ceremony, after the eighth song has been sung, the pipe bearer hands 
a lighted coal to the chief in response to his call, who then puts the coal 
in a long, straight, conical pipe holding six herbs; i^lacing the big end 
in his mouth, blows six pufi's between the ears of a stone fetish of a 
mountain lion. Is'o one else smokes this pipe, which is sacred. 

The same sacred character, apparently, is attributed to the pipe of 
ceremony by all the pueblo people as is given to it by the Moki, who 
again, at the great dance of the winter solstice, which lasts from four 
to nine days and nights, used the tubular pipe, as they probably do in 
all ceremonious dances; and in this veneration of the implement their 
views appear to accord with those of all other Indians. 

The conclusion is warranted that the general ceremony of smoking 
was similar at points far distant from each other; as, for example, from 
southern Virginia to the country of the Iroquois, from the mouths of 
the Mississippi to the Wisconsin Eiver, and through a large part of 
Kew Mexico, which would indicate a great antiquity when we consider 
the constant state of war in which the American Indian aj^jjears to 
have been engaged. 

CATLINITE AND SIOUAN TYPES. 

Beginning with the earliest records of the North American Indians, 
continuously to recent times, references are made to pipes of red mar- 
ble, red stone, and red indurated clay, which there is every reason to 
infer related to the stone now universally known as "catlinite," named 
after Mr. George Catlin, who lived many years among the Indians, 
painting their portraits in various costumes of peace and war, as they 
aj^peared on their hunting excursions and in their games, as well as in 
following their ordinary everyday vocations. These catlinite pipes 
have been found over a wide area, in Indian graves and of several 
forms, though the typical pipe of this material is the well-known rec- 
tangular pipe of the Sioux, those of other forms probably being com- 
paratively modern. Though the material has been so long known and 
under so many different names, and such wonderful stories have been 
told of it, the exact locality of the quarries from whence it is derived 
has been known scarcely fifty years. It is near the town of Pii)estone, 
in southwestern Minnesota. These quarries have quite recently been 
visited and most carefully surveyed and inspected by Prof. W. H. 
Holmes, who brought to the U. S. National Museum a section of the 
material, showing its location and structure in the bed. It is an indu- 
rated clay, forming a stratum about 12 inches thick, lying between beds 
of quartzite. It is of markedly laminated character, scarcely 2 inches 
of which is of sufficient thickness and suitable for carving pipes. The 



572 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

aucient pits from which this i)ipestoiie lias been taken extend for a 
distance of three-quarters of a mile, the older pits varying- from -0 to 
40 feet in width and from 4 to 10 feet deep, almost all of them now 
being' partly tilled witli water. The more recent pits are somewhat 
deeper, owing to their not having had time to fill in from the effects of 
seasonal changes. The dumps all over the edges of this ledge where 
refuse material has been thrown are from IS inches to 4 feet high. The 
l)its may be numbered by the hundreds. Upon removing the soil in 
many of them Professor Holmes found notched stone sledges of <|uartz- 
ite pebble and numberless siiheroidal hand-chipping hammers used in 
the quarrying and dressing process through which the material went 
to make it suitable for final dressing. Tbe quarries are still visited by 
the Sioux, who annually travel 200 miles or more from their reserva- 
tion to obtain the material to make into pipes. In one of the ancient 
pits Professor Holmes found indications of the burial of horses and 
cattle, and near the quarries are several low burial mounds from 20 to 
40 or more feet in diameter, and scattered near the pits are numerous 
lodge sites, indicated by circular or oblong depressions.' 

While little appears to be positively known concerning the length of 
time during which the (quarries have been worked, there can be little 
doubt that they have been in use from a period prior to the advent of 
the French on the IMississippi. The locality of these quarries is in the 
territory dominated by the Sioux, and they alone appear from the earli- 
est times to have had control of the "pipestone" of which the typical 
Sioux pipe is yet made, and little reliance can be placed in the state- 
ment of its ever having been a neutral site. Large blocks of the quartz 
have been sledged olf and thrown upon the various dumps along the 
outcrop, leaving the catliuite, where it is of sufficient density, to be 
worked into any necessary objects of ornament. There are some large 
bowlders in the immediate vicinity of the quarries, and upon many of 
them are visible aboriginal paintings and drawings of both animate 
and inanimate figures. 

Catliuite has by some writers been said to be soft when taken from 
the quarries and to become harder on exposure to the atmosphere; but 
the writer's experience in working this stone would indicate that the 
difference in working fresh or dry stone is insignificant, as pieces 
which have dried for years are yet nearly as soft as commercial soap- 
stone. Catliuite is quite a soft indurated clay, slightly harder than 
soapstone; easily cut with a steel knife, or scraped by means of sharj)- 
edged tools of stone or shell, or ground by stone or sand into any 
desired shape; and by pecking with a stone hammer this material may 
be formed with perfect ease into any shape, provided care be taken not 
to strike the blow in the plane of its lamination, along which the cleav- 
age is decidedly pronounced, and its thin lamellar structure becomes 
distinct and apt to fracture in thin sheets. At any angle to this cleav- 
age j)lane, however, the stone resists quite severe blows of the hammer

without injiny to the block upon \vhich the blow is given other than 
to cause spalls or pits to liy Irom each blow, Catlinite may, of course, 
be sawed, a blade of stone answering the purpose satisfactorily; but 
the work was, naturally, made much easier with iron tools. The thick- 
est layer of the stone is about the middle of the vein, from which, while 
onl}' li incihes thick at most, plates of this thickness may be obtained 
of almost any size. In boring this stone a jasper or quartzite drill 
point answers tjuite well. A wood shaft used with dry sand is 
equally serviceable. If the sand used in drilling is moistened it pre- 
vents the fresh sand falling to tlie bottom of the drill hole to replace 
those crystals which have been ground into powder, while if the sand 
be covered with water the powdered material floats to the top until 
thoroughly saturated; but the binding by which the drill j)oiut is 
held in position would be loosened if once wet, for the wooden point of 
the shaft would swell from the same cause, and the woru-off material 
would pack and retard work by forming a crust. If the sand or even 
the shaft be damp the swelling of the wood and packing of the dust 
is e(pially objectionable. Any stone which may be fractured so as to 
have a sliarj) edge answers as a tool with which to scrape the pipe- 
stone into shape; the harder the stone, of course, the longer its edge 
would hold without resharpening. The easiest primitive process of 
sawing would be to use a stone blade and dry sand until iron tools 
came into use, though a blade of copper would answer almost equally 
as well. To grind a smooth surface a gritty sandstone would be used — 
a coarse one first and finer one later. Any water-washed stone with 
sand would give a surface as smooth as that of any of the ancient 
pipes, polishing appearing to be quite a modern treatment, and seldom 
seen in catlinite pipes, unless made within the last fifty years. A 
pebble smooths the surface according to the fineness of its texture. 
Wood ashes gives a good surface and a hard bone is also excellent, 
acting as a burnisher, for this pipe stone is susceptible of taking a 
high i)olish, though those pipes of this material of purely Indian origin 
are seldom if ever polished more than could be done with any ordinary 
water-washed pebble. The difference in time requisite to make a pipe 
from stone fresh from the quarry or from dry stone would, in the writer's 
opinion, be too insignificant to be appreciable, and the most elaborate 
pipe of the Siouan type, stone tools being used in working it, could 
scarcely have required a day to complete. 

Primitive catlinite pipes, as stated, have been entirely without 
ornamentation, though the more recent exanq)les are often most elab- 
orately carved or have their surfaces inlaid Avith neat figures cut into 
the stone and filled in with sheet lead, the whole surface being subse- 
quently rubbed to a uniform smoothness, the contrast of the gray of 
the lead and the Indian red of the stone producing a most pleasing 
effect. The color of catlinite varies from dark red to light pink, and 
specimens are in the U. S. National Museum collection of mottled pink 
and white. Where the glazed surface is encountered, as it not unfre- 
quently is, there is usually evidence of modern manipulation. Much

or war all being themes fruitful of praise of this handsome stone, which 
certainly answers admirably for pipe material; though it is highly 
probable that this i)eculiar significance of the red and white color 
standing for peace or war was a modern attribute attached to the pipe 
because of the colors of the French and English fiags. Longfellow, 
in the song of Hiawatha, draws a pretty picture of the quarry, of the 
pi[)e, its stem, and the material smoked: 

On the Mountains of the Prairie, 
On the yreat Red Pipe-stone; Quarry, 
Gitche Manito, the mighty, 

From the red stone of the quarry 
With his hand ho Ijroke a fragment, 
Moulded it into a pipe-head. 
Shaped and fashioned it with tigiires* 
From the margin of the river 
Took a long reed for a pijie-stem. 
With its dark green leaves upon it; 
Filled the pipe with bark of willow. 
With the bark of the red willow ; 

# * * # * 

Break the red stone from this quarry, 
Mould and make it into Peace-Pipes, 
Take the reeds that grow beside you. 
Deck them with your brightest feathers, 
Smoke the Calumet together. 
And as Itrothers live henceforward ! 

The process of making pipes by the Sioux is thus described by Mr. 
Charles H. Bennett, of Pipestone City, Minnesota, as quoted by Dr. E, 
A. Barber: "A piece of the rock is selected from the best portion of 
the vein, and the Indian sculptor, with an old piece of lioop iron, or a 
broken knife blade which he has picked up, fashions the block rougldy 
into the desired form. Tben slowly and tediously, with the same tools, 
he bores out the bowl and the hole in the stem before carving the 
exterior, so that if in the process of boring the stem should be split no 
labor would be lost. After this is accomi)lished he shapes the surface 
into any design which he may have in view. This work often occu- 
pies weeks before it is completed, after which the carving is polished 
by rubbing it with grease or oils in the palms of the hands."' 

Dr. Barber refers to catlinite being found at several places in Dakota, 
Minnesota, and Wisconsin.'^ 

Catlin supposed the red steatite or pipe stone to be all traceable to

one source, and that near the mouth of the Teton Kiver on the upper 
Missouri, at that date yet unvisited except by the Indians, "given them 
by the Great Spirit for pipes, and forbidden to be used for anythinj*- else." 

Catlin also describes the manufacture of pipes, saying: "The Indians 
shape out the bowls of these pipes from solid stone, which is not quite 
as hard as marble, with nothing but a knife. The stone, -which is of a 
cherry-red, admits of a beautiful polish, and the Indian makes the hole 
in the bowl of the pipe by drilling into it a hard stick, shaped to the 
desired size, with a quantity of sharp sand and water kept constantly 
in the hole, subjecting him, therefore, to a very great labour and the 
necessity of much patience." • 

He says : " The shafts or stems of these pipes are from 2 to 4 feet long, 
sometimes round, but most generally liat, of an inch or two in breadth, 
and wound half their length or more with braids of porcupine quills, 
and often ornamented with the beak and tufts from the woodpecker's 
head, with ermine skins and long red hair, dyed from white horse hair 
or the white buffalo's tail. The stems of these pipes are carved in 
many ingenious forms and in all cases they are perforated through the 
center, quite staggering the enlightened world to guess how the holes 
have been bored through them, until it is simply and briefly explained 
that the stems are uniformly made of the stalk of the young ash, which 
usually grows straight and has a small pith through the center, which 
is usuall}' burned out with a hot wire, or a piece of hard wood by a 
much slower process." - 

Catlin also refers to the tradition that quarries were on neutral ter- 
ritory, where even enemies w^ould lay aside their arms and seek the 
material and smoke in peace, until finally the Sioux broke the truce. 

Henry R. Schoolcraft says this stone is "fissile and easily cut or 
ground, by trituration with harder substances, to any figure. It bears 
a dull polish, which was produced by rubbing the surface with the 
equisitum, or rush, which has a silicious, gritty surface." ^ 

Peter Kalm, early in the eighteenth century, referring to this sub- 
ject, says: "The old tobacco pipes of the Indians are likewise made of 
clay, or pot stone, or serpentine stone. The first sort are shaped like 
our tobacco pipes, though much coarser and not so well made. The tube 
is thick and short, hardly an inch long, but sometimes as long as a 
finger. Their color comes nearest to that of our tobacco jnpes which 
have been long used. Their tobacco pipes of pot stones are made of 
the same stone as their kettles. Some of them are pretty well made, 
though they had neither iron nor steel. But besides these kinds of 
tobacco pipes, we find another sort of pipe, which are made with great

ingenuity, of a very fine, red pot stone or a kind of serpentine marble. 
Tliey are very scarce and seldom made use of by any other than the 
Indian sachems or elders. The tine red stone of which these pipes are 
made is likewise very scarce, and is found only in the country of those 
Indians who are called Ingouez, and who, according- to Father Charle- 
voix, live on the other side of the river Mississippi. The Indians them- 
selves commonly vahie a pipe of this kind as much as a piece of silver 
of the same size, and sometimes they make it still dearer. Of the same 
kind of st(me commonly consists their pipe of peace, which the French 
call Calumet de Paix, and which they make use of in their treaties of 
peace and their alliances.'" 

There is little doubt that the red stone here referred to was catlinite. 

Hunter, referring to the Kickapoo, Kansas, and Osage tribes, says: 
"They also make bowls and pipes of a kind of indurated bole and of 
compact sand and limestone, which are excavated and reduced to form 
by means of friction with harder substances, and the intervention of 
sand and water. They generally ornament them with some figure 
characteristic of the owner's name, as, for instance, with that of a buf- 
falo, elk, bear, tortoise, serpent, etc., according to the circumstance or 
caprice that has given rise to its assumption. "- 

Barber refers to catlinite being found in Indian graves in New York, 
and in Georgia from a village site, points 1,200 miles from the quarry, 
and revealing the vast distances over which some intercommunication 
extended. ^ 

Specimens of this stone have been supposed to be found in an Indian 
burial place in Santa Barbara County, California, in the shape of tubes 
about 5 inclies long by a diameter of 1 inch, ^ though this supposition 
is evidently a mistaken one. 

Specimens coming under the writer's notice from California of the 
character referred to are made from a light pink indurated clay, which 
is, however, mixed with sand and much softer than the catlinite, though 
there is similarity in the color of the two stones. The California speci- 
mens have certainly been made from a local source of supply. 

William Mc Adams refers to a curved base " mound pipe " of catlinite 
found ill a mound on the Illinois Eiver bottom 15 miles from its mouth, 
where at a depth of 16 feet from the surface they found a basin of clay 
filled with clean white sand and a beautiful pipe of mottled catlinite.'^ 
This implement was found associated with sea shells and objects of 
copper. A present is referred to as early as 1G93, made by the western 
nations to the Iroquois, of "a calumet of red stone of extraordinary 
beauty and size." *■ 

The Indian is by no means the only one who worked the catlinite

iuto pipes, for Dr. F. V. Haydeu referred to the ISTortlnvest Fur Com- 
pany liaviug- manufactured nearly two thousand pipes during; two years 
between 1865 and 1808 and traded them to the Indians on the Upper 
Missouri, which fact will, 
he thinks, throw a sus- 
picion on Indian pipes 
in the future.' 

From the time John 
Smith's i)eople asked 
permission of Powhat 
tan to pass through his 
country to obtain stones 
from which to make 
axes to the present time 
the trade with the na- 
tives has consisted 
largely in those things 
made in imitation of aboriginal implements by the whites for Indian 
trade. This trade was most valuable and returned enormous profits 
on small capital invested, and its particulars would not be made pub- 
lic for fear of having the field too crowded. Notwithstanding a known 
large production of 'Mvampum" and of "roanoke" by the whites, refer- 
ences to its manufacture are unusual in the early records though it 
was not only an article of trade but of currency as well. 

When pipes are found with figures of men or bea.sts carved on them 
it is observed that those of a given type have the figures on them all 
facing in a particular direction, either to or from the smoker. 
Fig. 174 is one of the catlinite pipes brought from the country west 

of the ^lississippi b3^ Mr. George 
Catlin, which is 5^ inches long 
with a height of 3| inches, being 
made from an unusually heavy 
piece of stone 2^ inches thick, 
the bowl and stem holes being 
each three-eighths of an inch in 
diameter, the whole surface of 
the stone being highly polished. 
The stems of these pipes are 
round or square, while the pro- 
jections in front of the bowls are 
usually square or octagonal, decreasing usually toward the end; the 
bowls vary in form, some being square, others cylindrical or even sphe- 
roidal, and at times are carved with some excellence and have figures 
upon the stems, which usually face the smoker, and where this practice 
is departed from there is likelihood of its being done for the benefit, if

not in ridicule, of travelers. With scarcely a single exception among the 
Siouan pipes the bowl and stem are at right angles to each other. 

Fig. 175 is a red "pipe stone" 8 inches long and scarcely an inch in 
width, the bowl being 5 inches high. It was purchased of a dealer at 
Evanston, Illinois, by Mr. William Porter, and is probably of no consid- 
erable age, and not so well polished as the preceding example, as it was 

finished probably by 
means of ordiuaxy sand- 
paper, a material which 
the modern Sioux had 
learned the use of. The 
base of this pipe is flat, 
the point or prow run- 
ning out flat top and bot- 
tom, while the sides are 
convex beyond the base 
of the bowl, stem and 
bowl being cylindrical. The prolongation of the stem has been frac- 
tured and subsequently repaired in a most ingenious manner with 
sheet lead, to do which required a groove to be cut on each side of the 
fracture encircling the stem. From these grooves others were cut along 
the stem on both sides, into all of which lead was run or fitted and sub- 
sequently hammered down, after the broken pieces had been joined. 
Subsequently the lead was smoothed 
off level with the surface of the pipe, 
and the splice was complete. This re- 
paired stem demonstrates that the mod- 
ern Indian is not devoid of resources 
of a mechanical nature. A similar piece 
of work is illustrated by Mr. I. A. Lap- 
ham, from Wisconsin, of a fine-grained 
sandstone calumet on which plates of 
lead had been employed in repairing a 
fracture.' 

This pipe (fig. 176) is drawn after an 
illustration of Catliu, and shows how 
varied were these Siouan forms, while 
invariably remaining true to type, not- 
withstanding its double bowl rising 

from a single stem.^ A similar specimen is in the Douglass collection, 
which was obtained in 1820 by Maj. D. B. Douglass, father of the present 
owner^ in Minnesota, while accompanying Gen. Lewis Cass as astrono- 
mer of the expedition sent to make treaties with the Indians, the double 
bowl possibly being ancient. On'the stem of another pipe of catlinite in

the Douglass collection there stauds a bear lacing" the smoker, a pecul- 
iarity of which is that the bear's eyes are made of two white beads let 
into the stone, and evidences apparently the survival on the specimen 
of a practice noticed among i)ipes of the mound types. 

Fig. 177 is a dull red stone pipe from Fort Bufonl, North Dakota, 
collected by Mr. James P. Kimball. It is 3^ inches long and 3 inches 
high, stem and bowl openings 
each being five eighths of an 
inch in diameter, the pii)e hav- 
ing been cut out by means of a 
sharp blade, the facets left by 
the tool remaining distinct. 
The base is flat, the rest of the 
stem being cylindrical. The 
prolongation of the stem is flat- 
tened beyond the base of the 
bowl, its end having been 
broken off. This jiipe is evi- 
dently quite modern, as evi- 
denced by the crust of tobacco 
yet remaining in the bowl, the walls of which are about half an inch 
thick. The type is distinctly Siouan, though the stem is shorter than 
are usually those of Sioux pipes. The material is an indurated clay, 
possibly catlinite, though of a darker color, which may be owing to the 
stone being saturated with oil or grease. 
A highly polished catlinite pipe (fig. 178) from Dakota, collected by 

Gen. G. L. Febiger, United 
States Army, represents a 
man facing the smoker, the 
bowl being bored through the 
head and body. It is about 
4J inches long Math a height 
of 2.^ inches. Though the 
position of the figure is not an 
easy one it is carved entirely 
in the round with unusual 
artistic feeling, the legs being 
drawn up slightly on the stem 
with the hands and arms ex- 
tended along the legs and 
knees. It is of quite modern form, and there is yet wrapped around the 
neck a coil of fine brass wire, which in contrast to the cherry red of the 
stone gives a very i:>leasing effect. The lobes of the ears are bored 
evidently for the purpose of decorating them with pendants.

Upper Missouri drainage, and tliongli diftering both in material and 
certain of the characteristics from tlie preceding specimen retains 
much of the Siouan form, though the ridges near the end of tlie stem 
are in imitation of metal forms. It is finished with unusual skill. 
From one end to the other it is 4^ inches long and is about IJ inches 
wide. The bowl represents the head of a person, scarcely of Indian 
tyi)e, the sharp chin being markedly noticeable. The ears are bored 
with perforations an eighth of an inch in diameter, extending into the 
ear drums. The wing or elevation on the stem is scarcely an eighth 
of an inch tliick and has been perforated by a row of five holes. Tlie 
opening of the stem is but one-fourth of an inch in diameter, whereas 
that of the bowl is five-eighths of an inch, which is quite unusual in 
pipes of the Siouan type. There has been broken from the back of the 
head a knob intended apparently to represent a knot of hair somewhat 
on the order of the famous Indian head found by Squire and Davis. 
It is noticeable how markedly pronounced are the stone pipes having 
holes laterally bored in their stems, characteristic of those areas where 

snow lies longest, it being especially 
a feature of pipes found from the 
Atlantic to the Pacific north of the 
Great Lakes. 

Another of the War Dei)artment 
specimens (fig. 180) captured from 
the Indians of the drainage of the 
upper waters of the Missouri retains 
the type form of the Sioux, the pro- 
longation of the stem being less pro- 
nounced than usual. It is made 
from a black stone of medium hard- 
ness, possibly a chlorite, and is about the same dimensions as the last 
pijje except that the stem opening is much larger in proportion than in 
the last one, being half an inch, while the bowl is three-fourths of an 
inch in diameter. An alate, perforated wing extends along the base as 
in the last specimen; this wing is perforated from side to side for the 
purpose of attaching a cord; from the perforation along one side of 
this wing there extends a wavy line incised with such care as to impress 
the observer that it has some special significance. About one-half inch 
of the top of the bowl is composed of lead, Avliich is held in position by 
three plates having discoidal ends which are inlaid on the stone at 
equal distances around the bowl. 

Fig. 181 is a pipe of this type from the Upper Missouri, collected by 
the U. S. War Department. It is 4i inches long and made of metal, 
apparently lead. In order to protect the lead from the heat of the burn- 
ing tobacco a lining of sheet copper has been inserted in the bowl, and 
laps over the top, the bowl in its exterior shape being round, whereas 
the stem is square. Though there are upon this pipe no discernible

inokl marks, the lead part has probably been made for tlie Indian 
trade by tbe whites. 

Pipes of the Siouan form appear to be distributed over a wider area 
than almost any other type, owing in a measure to the attraetiveness of 
the usual red color of the catliiiite, which must have been used by the 
natives for pipes from their earliest accpiaintance with it, though others 
of the Siouan stock appear to 
have also used stones of their 
country, such as chlorite and 
green and gray steatites, as well 
as black chlorite, and later the 
white traders have introduced 
])ipes of the same character 
made of metal, which the In- 
dians have eventually used by 
iulaying in combination with 
the various pipe minerals. 

The wide distribution of the 
Siouan rectangular pipe is ]nob- 
ably owing to Indians using tliis type having adopted tlie smoking 
habit from tbe Sioux, who have long traded in catlinite. 

The long prow of the typical Siouan pipe appears to give way on the 
northern and western borders of their territory to a rectangular- 
stemmed pipe, often having a ring around its stem in relief, and a 
shortened prow, as is observed among the Ojibways, who are of Algon- 
quin stock. This form, however, 
appears more modern, and sug- 
gests ownership by another peo- 
ple. Hind refers to dift'ereut 
tribes affecting different pipe 
shapes.^ 

To the southwest of the Sioux 
the prow of the pipe is again 
encountered, though the stem is 
shorter. With few other pipes 
is there so strict regard had to 
characteristics of type and, at 
the same time, greater latitude 
allowed for ornamentation of the e.xterior. In this type the bowl is 
approximately as deep as the stem is long; the stem or prow may 
vary in length, and at times an alate projection rises almost like 
an inverted keel from the top of the stem and extending one-half or 
two thirds the way from the mouthpiece to the bowl. This wing is 
usually devoid of ornamentation; at other times, however, its upper 
edge may be notched, or a greater or less number of holes may be bored

through the keel, or the ornamentation may be of the character of fig. 
182, which is a black chlorite, with an inlaying of lead in bands around 
the upper part of tlie bowl, made by the Walipeton Sioux, Dakota, col- 
lected by Lieut. D. B. Wilson, United States Army. There is a crude 

eftbrt at ornamentation 
by means of a lead plate 
inlaying of a figure ap- 
parently intended to rep- 
resent a horse. On the 
stem base tbere is an in- 
laid plate of lead of about 
an inch in diameter let 
into the stone, into which 
in turn is inserted a red 
stone cross, both polished 
smoothly with the surrounding surface. This pipe was the property 
of a medicine man of the Wahpeton Sioux, and retains all of the Siouan 
characteristics, though it is evidently of recent origin. 

Fig. 183 is a typical Siouan catlinite pipe drawn after Catlin's illus- 
trations. It is to be doubted, however, whether the animal standing 
on the stem is intended to represent a pig or a 
bear. From our acquaintance with totemic cus- 
toms, however, it may be suspected that the bear 
was intended. This pipe was the property of a 
Missouri chief, Haw-che-ke-sug-ga, and, if cor- 
rectly drawn, is an unusual occurrence, for the 
animal faces from the smoker, a posture rarely 
allowed in Sioux pipe figures, and as the animal 
facing from the smoker is unique, it may be ques- 
tioned whether Oatlin may not have reversed the 
animal without due consideration. 

Prof. Gr. H. Perkins refers to a red pipe-stone 
specimen presenting some peculiarities from tlie 
Charaplain Valley, near Burlington, Vermont, 
which was plowed up on the surface. The bottom 
is furnished with a regular keel and ornamented 
with a number of holes made from side to side.' 
The keel-like ornamentation appears to be in 
some way derived from that so commonly found 
on the bases of Micmac pipes. 

A similar keel has been noted on a metal tomahawk pipe found as 

far south and east as Chester County, in Pennsylvania, which was 

made from (xerman silver, evidently copied from Siouan characteristics.

AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 583 

Mr. JaiJies E. Sebring (fig. 184), is, from au artistic point of view, 
one of the most ornate pipes of Indian origin which the writer has 
ever seen. Tlie art concept here evidenced is one of the most ancient 
known, though the shape of this pipe, as the pipe itself, is known to be 
quite modern. The bowl, in the form of an acorn, is held in the dis- 
tended jaws of the panther, the eyes, teeth, and ears of which are well 
carved, the projection extending from the back of the head being 
intended evidently to afford something to hold the pipe by when 
smoking it, being akin to the spear on tomahawk pipes, or possibly 
to projections common to pipes in New Mexico. The opening of the 
bowl of this i)ipe is seven-eighths of an inch in diameter, while 
that of the stem at its end is scarcely one eighth of an inch. It is 
singular that a Sioux Indian should have selected so elegant, and at 
the same time so antique, a style, for in the sculptures of Phcenicia the 
human head is held in the lion's mouth, the last vestiges of which may 
yet be encountered in the lion skin over the shoulders of the Greek 
figures of Hercules; in Babylonia the human face is held in the dis- 
torted Jaws of a fish, while coming nearer home, to Central and South 
America, the same principle is em- 
bodied in sculptured figures repre- 
sented as covered with human or beasts' 
skins or held in their distended Jaws, 
as the panther here holds the acorn.

has bored a hole from the base of the 

stem; from the same hole he has bored in the opposite direction toward 
the mouth j)iece; then from the mouthpiece a hole has been drilled inter- 
secting the latter hole. All that was then necessary to make a con- 
tinuous tube to the bowl was to plug the hole in the base of the stem, 
and this was accomplished by neatly inserting a plate over this hole, 
the lead being rubbed to au even surface with the rest of the stone. 

Fig. 185, from West Virginia, collected by Rev. J. A. Davis, repre- 
sents a much-worn, broken-bowled, small, well-polished, green pipe of 
the Siouan type, only 2 inches long, with a width scarcely more than 
half an inch. The wing on the stem would stamp its type, though the 
locality where found would indicate that it was far from where it was 
originally made. 

Prof. F. W. Putnam, referring to certain burials in cairns in Kansas, 
considers them more recent than mounds, and instances a number of 
dimiiuitive catlinite pipes found in these stone piles associated with a 
glass bead.^

elude that tlie typical catliiiite pipe was rectangular at the time of the 
first contact of the French with the Sioux, and that all pipes of this 
material differing in form are comparatively modern, and, as a matter 
of course, articles of European manufacture found in burials are of the 
historic period, as are those catlinites upon which animals are carved. 

PIPES OF THE NORTHWEST COAST. 

All along the western and northwestern coast of America a most 
curious style of pii)e is found, commonly of very grotesque form and 
made of a great varietj^ of material, such as wood, stone, antler, and of 
these materials in combinatioji with metal, bone, and mother-of-pearl. 
North of California almost all the pipes found not only indicate quite 
modern origin but, in a measure, are suggestive of being made for sale 
to the whites, though it can not be questioned that the Haida are 
remarkable as carvers of great originality and have been known as 

such from a very early period, 
their art being of a grotesque 
originality, rude, it is true, 
but uuiijue. 

Fig. 18G is a dark gray pipe 
of steatite, 4^ inches long, 2^ 
inches high, and li inches 
wide, from American River, 
Califoruin, collected by Col. 
E. Jewett, and does not aiJ- 
pear to have been much 
smoked, for had it been it 
would have been greased to 
give it a black color. In this 
pipe the bowl opening is five- 
eighths of an inch, while that of the stem is three eighths of an inch in 
diameter, though there is less constancy in the size of the California 
pipes than in most others. This specimen is a curious combination of 
man and beast, quite typical of California Indian art. The main figure 
is that of some crouching four-footed animal, resembling none with which 
we are acquainted, though probably readily recognizable by persons 
familiar with their system of symbolism. Its four feet are curled under 
the body; a long tail, forming a loop over the back, would suggest that 
a mountain lion were intended. Carved into the back of this beast, 
face up, is the diminutive figure of a human being, who lies upon his 
back. The large eyes and prominent muzzle of the creature represent 
a grotesque character of work, akin, apparently, to certain rude South 
American carvings, and in some respects having characteristics encoun- 
tered at times in ivory carvings from Japan or China, though there is 
sufficient individuality to entitle it to a place of its own. This pipe is 
quite massive and has been carved by means of sharp tools of iron, 
though the work could be done with a sharp-bladed shell or stone.

Fig. 187 from Puget Sound, collected by Lieut. Charles Wilkes, United 
States i^avy, is a couibinatiou pipe of wood, bone, and tin, and shows 
what variety there is at times in modern Indian art. It is a pipe appar- 
ently orioinating on the Pacific coast, intended chietly to attract travel- 
ers. It is 18 inches long and 4: inches high, representing, one might 
almost say, a farm, houses, and garden. The chimney of the house is 
composed of a tin cylinder, and at times a brass or copper cartridge is 
made to answer the same purpose by perforating the side of the shell to 
allow the smoke to escape into the stem. The sides of the h(mse and 
part of the balance of the ornamentation consist of bone in thin plates 
fastened to the wood of which the bulk of this pipe is made. The carv- 
ing is decidedly characteristic of the locality from which it comes, though 
the houses, gate, and trees indicate clearly how modern they are. In 
the ijrow of a boat-shaped pipe in the U. S. National Museum collec- 
tion from Puget Sound a disk-like depression has been cut, into which 
a plate of mica is neatly fitted, and on another a crowing rooster is 
figured. The inlaying of many of these i>ipes has been made more

eflPective by using the nacre of the abalone shell, which, with its bril- 
liant green coloring, is most pleasing, especially when used for the eyes 
of the monsters they adorn. These people carve at times most pic- 
turesque and ludicrous figures from deer horns, sawed off at the point 
where the horn enters the skull, taking every advantage of the shai^e 
of the horn to add to the artistic eflFect of the pipes, and though the 
totem posts have been so long known, with their quaint, rude figures, 
one can but wonder to what extent the carving of these people has been 
influenced by the Japanese, who have long been on the upper coast. 

Pipes made by the natives of Queen Charlotte Island and the shores 
of British Columbia and the Tshimpshian tribes north of Vancouver 
Island are usually composed of a black slate, representing various 
animals, man included, and figures in singular postures are most attract- 
ive, though modern, and carved with steel tools, with a fidelity suffi- 
ciently accurate to enable one to recognize the animals intended, though 
these pipes of slate appear to represent a manufacture which chiefly 
aims to attract the tourist and curiosity seeker. 

Pipe bowls of the Chinook Indians^ according to Bancroft, were made 



586 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

of wood fitted to elder stems, but the best ones, of stone, elegantly carved, 
were of Haida manufacture and are obtained from the north.' 

While there is good reason to doubt if the American Indian on any 
part of the continent ever knew of the use of the bow or pump drill be- 
fore the advent of Europeans there is much evidence that throughout 
the continent fire to light the pipe was made by twirling one stick upon 
another, and in the Southwest there is evidence that fire was made by 
plowing or rubbing one stick back and forth in the groove of another. 

Uind says of the pipes of theBabeen Indians, "While they exhibit a 
much higlier degree of art than we should expect to find among such a 
savage race, they are illustrations of their imitative power and ingen. 
ions workmanship. The grotes(jue devices with which their pipes are 
ornamented can generally be traced to objects which they have seen 
since they became familiar with the white traders belonging to the 
Hudson Bay Company on the jSTorthwest Coast." ^ 

Gilbert Malcolm Sproat says: "The Aht Indians are fond of tobacco, 
but they have no medicine pipe, nor do I think they have among them 
the marked superstitious j)ipe usuages by which most of the IS^orth 
American Indian tribes are distinguished. They formly had plain 
cedar pipes (rosh-kuts) devoid of ornament, but there were also to be 
found in all the tribes the ornamental bluestone (Tshimpean) pipe which 
had been obtained in traffic with the Northern Indians. The present 
Aht name for tobacco (Quish-shah) is their word for smoke. Tobacco 
has been so long known to the natives that they can hardly explain 
what material they smoked before they had it, but they probably in 
former times made use solely of the leaves of the small shrub which is 
to this day mixed with tobacco in their pipes for the purpose of dimin- 
ishing the intoxicating effect. It is customary after meals to pass the 
Ijipe around among the guests." ' 

That smoking tobacco is a modern practice with certain tribes 
there can be little doubt, and is indicated in the account of Lewis 
and Clarke, who said of the natives on one part of the Columbia 
Eiver: "During these preparations he smok.ed with those about him 
who would accept tobacco, but very few were desirous of smoking, a 
custom which is not general among them, and chiefly used as a matter 
of form in great ceremonies."^ 

These people probably smoked other plants than tobacco, though to 
what extent it is difficult to say. According to George Gibbs, the 
Tinneh or Chippewayan Indians of British and Russian America 
between the Mackenzie and Peel rivers and the Yukon and banks of 
the Porcupine, about the sixty-eighth degree of latitude, make "no 
intoxicating driidis whatever, but are passionately fond of tobacco. 
This taste thev of course learned of the whites. Most of the Kutchius

smoke in the same manner that we do, but some of the tribes use the 
same pipes as tlie Eskimo and swallow the smoke. This kind of a 
pipe has a wooden stem 12 inches long- slightly curved upward; the 
bowl is well represented by half of a reel for winding sewing cotton 
ui)on, and the hole in the pipe is about the same as that in the spool."

ESKIMO PIPE. 
After Gporge Gilibs. Sniithsimian Report, ISISR, p. S9J. 

The pipe is of the shape shown in fig. 188. " The bowl is made of metal. 
They do not smoke i)iire tobacco in it, but mix it with the scrapings of 
willow." ' 

The curves of i)ipes of this type vary greatly, depending in a great 
measure upon the locality where found, the bowls at times being of 
stone and the sizes of the stems increase as the Siberian coast is ap- 
proached. Exami)les in the U. S. iSTational Museum may be seen with 
less curve than has the one here ilUistrated, or with even more curve 
than fig. 189, which is an Eskimo pipe collected at Nome Island, 
Alaska, by I'rof. I. C. Eussell, It is of wood, its length being 7h inches, 
or sitting up, about 7 inches, and, as with all pipes of extreme North- 
western America, the 
stems are so con- 
structed as best to 
allow the owner to col- 
lect the nicotine or 
juices of the j)lant 
smoked. This i»ipe, 
while not so heavy and 
thick in the stem as 
many from the Russian 
possessions, resembles 
the latter greatly and 
is presumably copied 
from the Russian tyjie. 
The bottom olitlie stem has a small opening like a trapdoor, which can 
be closed at ])leasure while in general use. The stem is loosely packed 
with some absorbent. This in turn is taken out by opening the plate 
or trapdoor and either smoked or eaten, a practice customary with the 
Eskimo. These stems are made of wood scraped to a thickness of from

oue-sixteentli to one eightli of an inch, the mouthpiece usually con- 
sisting- of a hollow bone plug, the opposite eud being often stopped with 
a copper pistol cartridge. The bowl consists of a compact green serpen- 
tine, its opening being scarcely more than one-fourth of an inch in 
diameter, its base being so shaped as to fit the stem closely and is 
held in position by a strap of sealskin; at other times they are fitted 
into shoulders. This arrangement enables the smoker to take his pipe 
apart and lose none of the contents of bowl or stem, which is considered 
of great value. 

This type of pipe appears closely allied to the Japanese pipes, the 
most ancieut of which, according to the Marquis of Nadaillac, date of 
the seventeenth century.^ Thej^ appear to have been introduced eitlier 
by way of Siberia or the Kurile and Aleutian islands, whi{;li would 
indicate that the use of tobacco had practically circumnavigated a 
large part of the globe, and been returned to America from Asia. 
Whether the first knowledge of tobacco which the Europeans had came 
from Spanish, French, or English sources, there is no doubt that its use 
quickly spread from the eastern side of the American continent, and 
the plant w^as thence distributed as a plant possessing valuable medic- 
inal properties to the most distant parts of Europe, then to Asia, and 
thus again to the American continent, entering by the west. The 
shapes of pipes would be governed, presumably, largely by local sur- 
roundings and supply, and also to some extent by individual taste. 
Tobacco after its introduction into Europe rapidly came into general 
use. In 1774 P. Le Eoy describes the experiences of four Kussian sail- 
ors who were left on shore on the island of East Spitzbergen, who 
"carried a tinder box and tiiider, a bladder lilled with tobacco, and every 
man his wooden pipe.'' ^ All liussian sailors at this time were said to 
he expert carpenters. 

Cai^taius Cook, Gierke, and Gore, in their expedition to the Pacific in 
1770 to 1780 on the North American Goast, refer to the natives being 
in possession of iron between latitude 01° 30" north and 53° 35" north. 
At Unalaska, in 53° 35" north, on the Alaskan peninsula. Cook refers 
to the natives trading some fishing implements for tobacco,^ and says 
there are few that do not both smoke and chew tobacco and take snuff.^ 

The natives about latitude 59° 37' 30" and longitude 197° 45' 48", 
Cook says, "seemed perfectly unacquainted with any civilized nation ; 
they were ignorant of the use of tobacco; nor did we observe in their 
possession any foreign articles, unless a knife may be considered as 
such." ^•'

Cook speaks of the natives of the Ahiskau Coast being acute traders, 
even requiring pay for grass and endeavoring to get pay for water. lie 
speaks also of the carvings of their canoes. 

G. H. Von Lingsdorf refers to the Aleutian Islanders in the first 
decade of this century as not being "addicted to smoking, but are pas- 
sionately fond of snutt". They will work a whole day at the hardest 
labor to get a single leaf of tobacco as their wages, and when obtained 
tliey prepare it for use by grinding it to powder in a mortar made of 
the bones of whales, mixing it with ashes and water." ' 

The Kutchin and eastern Tinneh, we are informed by Mr. W. H. Dall, 
use a pipe modeled after the clay pipes of the Hudson Bay Company, 
but he says "they also carve very pretty ones out of birch knots and 
the roots of the wild rosebush.'- ^ 

The writer is informed by Capt. E. P. Herendeen, Avho has spent 
many years in northern Alaska, that the natives use willow twigs, 
which have been cut crosswise, for smoking purj)oses. The Siberian 
natives use the willow root for dyeing, but the remainder of the root is 
used for smoking. 

At Point Barrow, in 1837, we are told "the grand article in demand 
here was tobacco, which, as in Dease Inlet, they call tawac or tawacah, 
a name acquired, of course, from the Russian traders. Not content with 
chewing and smoking it, they swallowed the smoke until they became 
sick, and seemed to revel in a momentary intoxication. Beads, rings, 
buttons, tire steels, everything we had, were regarded as inferior to 
tobacco, a single inch of which was an acceptable equivalent for the 
most valuable article they possessed."^ 

Sir Edward Belcher says of the Point Barrow Eskimo in 1825-1829: 
"They had long had the habit of smoking, but used the stem and down 
of a peculiar grass steeped in some aromatic gum, probably derived 
from a tir. They did not use tobacco until we introduced it." ^ 

John Murdoch, who was a member of the International Polar Expe- 
dition to Point Barrow, Alaska, 1881-1883, has very fully discussed 
the smoking habit of these natives. Among other things relating 
thereto, he says: "The only narcotic in use among these people is 
tobacco, which they obtain directly or indirectly from the whites, and 
which has been in use among them from the earliest time when we 
have any knowledge of them. When Mr. Elson, in the Blossom\^ barge, 
visited Point Barrow in 182(;, he found tobacco in general use and the 
most marketable article. This undoubtedly came from the Russians 
by way of Siberia and Bering Strait, as Kotzebue found the natives of

tbe sound which bears his name, who were in coniuinnication with the 
Asiatic coast by way of the J)iouiedes, already achlicted to the use of 
tobacco in 181G. It is not probable that tobacco was introduced on the 
Arctic coast by way of the IJussian settlements in Alaska. There were 
no Knssian posts north of Bristol Bay until 1833, when St. Michael's 
redoubt was built. When Captain Cook visited Bristol Bay, in 1778, 
he found that tobacco was not used there, while in Norton Sound the 
same year 'the natives had no dislike to tobacco.' " 

Neither was it introduced from the English j^osts in the east, as 
Franklin found the Kimmudliii not in the habit of using it. "The 
western Esquimaux use tobacco, aud some of our visitors had smoked 
it, but thought the flavor very disagreeable." Nor had they adopted 
the habit iu 1837. When the Plover wintered at Point Barrow, 
according to Dr. Simpson's account, all the tobacco, except a little 
obtained from the English discovery ships, came from Asia, and was 
brought by the Nunatailmiun. At present the latter bring very little, 
if any, tobacco, and the supply is obtained directly from the ships, 
though a little occasionally finds its way up the coast from the south- 
west. They use all kinds of tobacco, but readily distinguish and desire

the sorts considered best by the whites. For instance, they were eager 
to get the excellent quality of "navy" tobacco furnished by the com- 
missary department, while one of our party who had a large quantity of 
exceedingly bad flue-cut tobacco could hardly give it away. * * * 
The habit of chewing tobacco is almost universal. Men, women, and 
even children, though the latter be but 2 or 3 years old and unweaned, 
when tobacco is to be obtained, keep a "chew," often of enormous size, 
constantly iu the mouth. The juice is not spit out, but swallowed with 
the saliva, without producing any signs of nausea. The tobacco is 
chewed by itself and not sweetened with sugar, as was observed by 
Hooper and Nordenskiold among the Chuckches.^ 

Fig. 190, from Utkiawin, Alaska, collected by Mr. John Murdoch, has 
an iron bowl, noticeable for the ornamentation of the shank. This has 
evidently been heated and shrunk on. The wooden stems of these pipes 
appear to be willow or birch and are in two longitudinal sections, held

togetlier by the Isishiiig of seal-skin thong- which serves to attach the 
bowl to the stem. This lashing was evidently put on wet and allowed 
to shrink, and the ends are secured by tucking under the turns. The 
whipping at the mouthpiece is of fine sinew thread. A picker of steel 
for cleaning out the bowl is attached to the stem by a piece of seal 
thong, the end of whicli is turned under the lashing. 

Fig. 101, from Utkiawiu, Alaska, also collected by IMr. John Murdoch, 
has a bowl of rather soft greenish gray slate. The stones are always 
of the same material and put together in the same way, but are some-

sometimes of three-ply sinew braid. The bowl shows the greatest 
variation both in form and material.

more frequently used in the house and by the women. The stem is 
usually a foot to 13 inches long, though pipes at least IS inches long 
were seen. To most pipes are attached pickers, as in the type speci- 
men. The picker is in all cases of metal, usually iron or steel, but 
sometimes of copper. When not in use the point is tucked under 
the lashing under the stem. The pipes are readily taken apart for 
cleaning." 



592 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

Fig. 193, collected by Mr. Jobn Muidocli, at Utkiawin, Alaska, is a 
iiui(iue specimen and of the most primitiv^e character. 

It is simply a rough willow stick, slightly whittled into shape, split aud hollowed 
out like a pipe stem. It is held together by a whipping of siuew thread, aud a 
lashiug of deerskin fastened by a slipknot at one end, the other being tucked in, as 
usual. A small funnel-shaped hole'at one end serves for a bowl, and shows by its 
charred surface that it has actually been used. This pipe was bought from one of 
the Nuuatanmiun, who were in camji at Pernyu iu 1883, and shows its inland origin 
ill the use of the deerskin thong. A coast native would have used seal thong. The 
pipe is carried at the girdle either with the stem thrust inside the breeches or in a 
bag attached to the belt. It is a long, narrow cylindrlc bag, made of four white 
ermiue skins, with two hind legs aud two tails forming a fringe round the bottom 
which is of dressed deerskin, in one piece, flesh side out. Tobacco is carried in a 
small pouch attached to the girdle, and tucked inside the breeches, or sometimes 
worn under the jacket, slung round the neck by a string or the necklace. * * » 
Tobacco as prepared for smoking by the Eskimo consists of common black cavendish 
or "Navy" tobacco, cut up very fine and mixed with finely chopped wood in the 
proportion of about two parts of tobacco to one of wood. We were informed that 
willow twigs were used for this purpose. The method of smoking is as follows: 
After cleaning out the bowl with the picker a little wad of deer hair, i)lucked from 
the clothes in some inconspicuous ])lace, generally the front skirt of the inner jacket 
is rammed down to the bottom of the bowl. This is to jireveut the line tobacco

getting into the stem and clogging it. The bowl is then filled with tobacco, of 
which it holds only a small quantity. The mouthpiece is placed between the lips, 
the tobacco ignited aud all smoked out iu two or three long inhalations. The smoke 
is very deeply inhaled aud allowed to pass out slowly from the mouth and nostrils, 
bringing tears to the eyes, often producing giddiness, aud almost always a violent 
fit of coughing. I have seen a man almost prostrated from a single pipe full. This 
method of smoking has beeu in vogue from the time of our first acquaintance with 
these people. Though they smoke little at a time they smoke frequently when 
tobacco is plentiful. The use of the Kui'nyij, which name appears to be applied to 
the native pi))e8, seems to be confined to the adults. We knew of no children 
owning them, though their parents made no objection to their chewing tobacco or 
owning or u.sing clay or wooden pipes, which they obtained from us. They carry 
their fondness for tobacco so far that they will even eat the oily refuse from the 
bottom of the bowl, the smallest portion of which would produce nausea in a white 
man. This habit has beeu observed at Plover Bay, Siberia. Tobacco ashes are 
also eaten, probably for the sake of the potash they contain, as one of the men at 
Utkiawin was fond of carbonate of soda, which he told the doctor was just like what 
he got from his pipe. Pipes of this type diff'ering in details, but all agree in having 
very small bowls, fre(juently of metal, and some contrivance for opening the stem, 
are used by the Eskimos from at least as far south as the Yukon Delta (as shown by 
the collections in the National Museum) to the Anderson River and Cape Bathurst, 
and have even been adopted by the Indians of the Yukon, who learned the use of 
tobacco from the Eskimos. They are undoubtedly of Siberian origin, as will be seen 
by comparing the figure of a Chukch pipe in Nordenskiolds Vega, and the figure of

a Tuuguse pipe in Seebobui's Siberia iu Asia, with the pipes (iiiiired fioiu our collec- 
tion. Moreover, the method of smoking is precisely that practiced in Siberia, even 
to the proportion of wood mixed Avith tobacco. The consideration of the qnestiou 
whence the Siberians ap(iuired this {peculiar method of smoking would lead nie 
beyond the bounds of the present work, but I can not leave the subject of pipes 
without calling attention to the fact that Nordenskirdd has alluded to the resem- 
blance of these to the Japanese pipes. A gentleman who has spent many years in 
China also informs me that the Chinese pipes are of a very similar type and smoked 
in mnch the same way. 

At Kolymsk in 1820, according to Ferdinand Wrangell, the tobacco 
was mixed by tlie Russians with finely powdered larch wood to make it 
go farther.^ 

Sir William Edward Parry, while in the Fury and Hecla, 181*1-1823, 
collected upward of live hundred words, but the list contains no word 
either for pipe or tobacco.^ 

This would indicate beyond doubt that the language contained none 
such and that the smoking habit was comparatively new to them, which 
certainly appears the accepted belief. 

Murdoch says: ''We have indeed positive proof that the people of 
the Mackenzie region acquired the habit of smoking from their western 
neighbors."^ 

Of their present habit, however, he says: "All the Eskimo, with the 
exception of the so-called Arctic Highlanders, of Smith Sound, and per- 
haps some of the more remote tribes of the central region, are passion- 
ately addicted to the use of tobacco. East of Cape Bathurst it is 
perfectly well known that the taste was acquired directly from the 
Europeans, Danes and English, who have made more or less permanent 
settlement in these regions. On the other hand, the first explorers 
who visited the Eskimo on the northwest coast of America found 
tobacco alreadj^ in use among them."^ 

Capt. F. W. Beechy says of the natives of Kotzebue Sound in 1825- 
1828: "We were joined by three Caiacs from some tents near us and 
four from the river who were very troublesome, pestering us for tawack, 
and receiving the little we had to give in the most ungracious manner 
without offering any return."''^ 

Mr. James G. Swan says of the natives of Cape Flattery : "After eat- 
ing they sometimes, but not always, indulge iu a whiff of tobacco, but 
smoking is not a universal practice among them, * * * Smoking 
is practiced even less than among some of the tribes east of the Kocky 
Mountains, and there are no ceremonials connected with its use. Occa- 
sionally an Indian will swallow a quantity of smoke, which, being

Mr. W. H. Dall refers to the Kutchin Indians of Alaska, who "make 
pretty pipe stems out of goose quills, wound about with colored porcu- 
pine quills."'^ 

In the territory contiguous to the Yukon, Dall says "we would stop 
every few minutes to let the Indians smoke. The operation takes less 
than a minute. Their pijjes are so constructed as to hold but a very 
small pinch of tobacco. A pinch of tobacco cut as fine as snuff is 
inserted and two or three whiflfs are afforded by it. The smoke is 
inhaled into the lungs, producing a momentary stuijefactiou, and the 
operation is over."'' The bowls of the Yukon pipes are generally cast 
from lead. Sometimes they are made of soft bone or even hard wood. 
In smoking a few reindeer hairs pulled from his parka are rolled into a 
little ball and placed in the bottom of the bowl to prevent the contents 
being drawn into the stem. 

The Indian pipe Dall considers a copy of the Eskimo pipe, as the 
latter were the first to obtain and use tobacco. Many of the tribes call 
it by the Eskimo name. A fungus which grows on decayed birch trees, 
or tinder manufactured from the down of the poplar rubbed up with 
charcoal, is used with Hint and steel for obtaining a light. The 
Chuck chees, Mr. Dall says, "use a pipe similar to those of the Eskimo, 
but with a much larger and shorter stem. This stem is hollow and 
filled with fine birch shavings. After smoking for some months these 
shavings, impregnated with the oil of tobacco, are taken out through 
an oijening in the lower j)art of the stem and smoked over." Mr. Dall 
also informs the writer that this large pipe with the movable plate in 
the stem is native to the Asiatic side of Bering Strait. In this stem 
they also use willow and alder, which, when sufficiently saturated, are 
smoked. Both willow and sumac are mixed with the tobacco to make 
it go farther. 

Kordenskjold refers to the Chuckchee pipe, which is similar to that 
from Point Barrow, which resemble those of the Tunguse. The tobacco, 
he says, is often first chewed, then dried behind the ear, and kept in a 
separate pouch suspended from the neck, to be afterwards smoked. 
The pipes are so small, he remarks, like those of the Japanese, that 
they may be smoked out with a few strong whiffs. The smoke is 
swallowed. Even the women and children smoke and chew, and they 
begin to do so at so tender an age that we have seen a child that could 
indeed walk, but still sucked his mother, both chew tobacco and smoke.* 

Mr. W. H. Hooper refers to the Tuski " pipes of wood and ivory, either 
divided along the middle into two parts for convenience of cleaning, or

is covered with a strip of leather which effectually keeps it air-tight. 
Wheu about to smoke, a pinch of hair plucked from the deerskin frock 
is pushed with the pricker down the very small hole in the bowl of the 
pipe. This is to prevent the tobacco from drawing through.'*' 

Mr. Henry Seebohm illustrates a pipe of the Tungoosk, which so 
closely resembles certain of the pipes of the Alaskans, both in bowl 
and manner of lashing the same to the stem, as well as the shape 
and lashing of the stem itself, as to leave little doubt of their common 
origin.- 

The same author illustrates a pipe of the Samoyede which should be 
classed as of the same type as those pipes here described, yet present- 
ing other characteristics than such as are embodied in the Alaskan 
specimens. 

Arising probably from similar conditions is an Afridi pipe from the 
Jvhyber Pass, in India, illustrated by Pritchett, which has a small 
brass bowl and a stem composed of two pieces of wood which have 
tiFst been scooped out and subsecjueutly lashed together with thongs, 
and so closely resembles the Alaskan type that one would be i^er- 
lectly excusable in mistaking it for the latter.^ It appears diflS- 
cult to determine the period when the pipe appeared first on the 
extreme northwestern coast of America, and equally so to deter- 
mine Avhence it came, its form in many respects resembling more 
nearly the Chinese than the Japanese type, though there are accounts 
of the Eussians having in the last century attacked Japanese islands 
and brought away prisoners to Kamtschatka, pipes being referred 
to among articles enumerated as taken at the same time. The extent 
of communication between Kamtschatka and the Japanese is little 
known, though Japanese was taught at Irkutsk about 1807, accord- 
ing to G. E. Von Lingsdorf, who says: "It is worthy of remark that 
by command of Her Imperial Majesty, the late Empress Catherine, the 
Japanese language was taught, and the teacher of it was a native of 
Japan." ^ 

Cook informs us that, in 1778, of the islanders near Kamtschatka 
there were few who did not both chew, smoke, and take snuff, a luxury 
which he truthfully says bids fair to always keep them ijoor.' 

It is known that about 17G4 the Kamtschatdales "sometimes smoked 
tobacco" which they received from Europe." 

"It is said that the Kamtschatdales knew the use of iron even before

who came from the Kurilski Islands, and once to the mouth of the river 
Kamtschatka, and that the name which the Kamtschadales give the 
Japanese of Shisman comes from ' shish,' a needle. The Japanese cer- 
tainly used to come and trade to the Kurilski Islands, for I found there 
a Japanese saber, a Japanese waiter, and silver earrings, which could 
be brought from no other place.''' 

The Tchuckchi pipe has apparently traveled across Bering Strait 
quite recentl 3^, judging from the similarity in the pipes on the Asiatic 
and American sides. The most natural supposition appears to the 
writer to be that the Tchuckchi in their turn received the pipe from the 
Japanese by way of the Kurile Islands, they possibly in turn receiving 
it from the Chinese. 

MISCELLANEOUS PUEBLO PIPES. 

In the southwestern part of the United States are found a class of 
pipes usually made of pottery, certain of which resemble the Siouau 
pipe in a measure, though there is a distinctiveness about them enti- 
tling them to be classed 
by themselves. Those in 
the collection of the U. S. 
Xational Museum are all 
made from a rude, hard 
burned, and un glazed 
black pottery. Some 
have projections similar 
to the Sioux pipe, the 
I)row being approxi- 
mately the same size as 
the stem, as seen in fig. 
194. This specimen, except that it is made of this hard pottery, is not 
very unlike in outline from the Siouan pipes of the Ujjper Missouri 
River drainage. The stem, however, of these southwestern pipes is 
heavy and thick, as are the walls of the bowls, the stem opening being 
formed by inserting a stem of grass through the plastic clay and burning 
it out in firing the pipe. 

Fig. 195, from the Wolpi jjueblo in Arizona, collected by Col. James 
Stevenson, is made of this typical hard unglazed i)ottery, similar to 
specimens found at times among the Iroquois graves of Canada or the 
United States, near Lakes Erie, Ontario, and the St. Lawrence River, 
which have similar stem o])enings. The inverted terrace-like i)rojectiou 
below the bowl indicates how varied it was, and that it was probably 
intended to hold the pipe by when it was smoked. The outline of the 
exterior of bowl and stem of this pipe may be duplicated in soapstone 
in the Carolinas. The pottery from which these pipes are made, though 
of recent manufacture, does not compare with that of the ancient

inches long and l.j 
inches wide. The pro- 
jection is square, and 
the stem hole is evi- 
dently intended for a 

separate stem. The difference in position of these projections, with- 
out other evidence, would be almost convincing that the form of this 
pipe was in a transition stage. 

Fig. 197 represents a cast of a greenstone 
pipe found near Santa Fe, New Mexico, col- 
lected by Maj. W. S. Beebe. It is of unusual 
size, being 12 inches long and 7.^ inches high, 
having a bowl the greatest exterior diameter 
of which is 2^ inches. This pipe is of typical 
Mexican shape, and is finished with such ar- 
tistic skill as to leave little doubt of its being 
of ceremonial importance to the tribe possess- 
ing it. The stem curves gracefully into the 
bowl, the top of which is carved 
in the form of an eagle or hawk 
facing the smoker. Crawling 
along the sides of the stem and 
its base, reaching two-thirds of the way up the bowl, are 
three rattlesnakes; the fourth snake reaches along the 
upper part of the stem 
nearly to the end, its 
tail being on the bowl. 
The rattles of the sn akes 
are well defined. Above 
each of the snakes, 
crawling up the bowl, 
are the figures of three 

separate human beings, as though each snake were crawling toward 
a separate person. The original of this pipe, which appears to be 
highly polished, in the writer's opinion is one of those presented to

the Iiidiaih, upon certain solemn occasions in commemoration of some 
treaty, and which were intended as reminders of some notable event 
or agreemeiit undertaken. To one such in I^ew York a reference has 
been preserved. 

Dr. J. Walter Fewkes found the natives of Tusayan, New Mexico, 
smoking upon all ceremonial occasions the Nkotiana attemtata (Piba; 
from napi, leaf; paku moisture), which forms also part of nearly all 
prayer ofi'erings.' 

Foeniculum officinale, (kwanwa-pibaj from kwanwa, sweet; piba, to- 
bacco)^ is used as a substitute for piba, but is never smoked ceremoni- 
allj^ The same term applies to tobacco obtained from the whites, 
which is not used ceremonially. 



DELAWARE TYPES. 

Holm, as quoted by Dr. C. C. Abbott, says of the Delaware Indians: 
"They make tobacco pipes out of reeds about a man's length. The 
bowl is made of horn, and to contain a great quantity of tobacco. 
They generally present these pipes to their friends. They made them 
otherwise of red, yellow, and blue clay, of which there is a great quan- 
tity in the country, also of white, gray, green, brown, black, and blue 
stones, which are so soft that they can be cut with a knife. Of these 

they make their pipes a yard and a 
half long."3 

Fig. 198, collected by Prof. S. S. 
Haldeman, of Delaware, differs in 
certain respects from pipes found 
elsewhere and points to a type dis- 
tinct from any yet described. This 
pipe is about 3 inches long and is 
made from a compact black stone, 
probably a slate. The round bowl 
of this type often has a slight lip in 
front, and the stem is usually ex- 
ternally square, with some animal 
carved upon it focing the smoker. The diameter of the bowl opening is 
five-eighths of an inch, while that of the stem is but one-fourth of an inch ; 
this proportion usually being constant in all typical specimens. The 
turtle crawls toward the smoker, its head, neck, eyes, and both shells 
being distinguishable, though the feet and legs are not. The work on 
this pipe appears to be done by means of steel tools, file marks being 
distinct. Dr. Abbott refers to pipes of this type — one from Delaware, 
the other from Pennsylvania, made of a greenish compact serpentine.^

County, Xortli Carolina, and collected by Gen. .1, T. Wilder, is ."li 
inches long and made from a dark-green chlorite. Tlie characteristic 
lip of the bowl is pronounced, the bear facing the sihoker supplants 
the turtle of the preceding specimen. The bear stands on all four feet, 
and is carved in the round, his front and hind claws being represented, 
though the mouth and eyes are not. Pipes of this type are usuall}^ 
ground to quite a smooth surface, and 
are decidedly symmetrical, being among 
the most modern of distinctively Ameri- 
can Indian pipes. 

xVnother pipe of this type (flg. 200) from 
Xorth Carolina and collected by Mr. 
James Mooney, diflters from the preced- 
ing figures only in the character of the 
stem, which is round. The animal 
figured is probably a gray squirrel, with 
its bushy tail, in the act of eating, or rub- 
bing its face. The specimens of these 

pipes will in all i^robability, when hereafter found, demonstrate that 
while bowl and stem cavities remained constant the animals upon their 
stems will differ because of their liaving a totemic significance, as appears 
highly probable of animal figures wherever found, especially as those 
which are recognizable are known totems of American tribes. 

Mr. D. r>. Brunner figures a pipe of this type from the collection of 
Gen. George M. Keim, of Berks County, Pennsylvania, which has a 
square stem and is without ornamentation and made of a dark serpen- 
tine, the pipe being finely polished.' 

In the museum of the University of Pennsylvania are two pipes of 

this type from Xorth Carolina, one plain, 
the other having a bear on the stem. 

INDETERMINATE TYPES.

County, Indiana, collected by Mr. George 
Spangler, is a type specimen of a distinct 
class of i)ipes of rectangular shape, which 
are found in several States and are usu- 
ally finished with some skill. The one 
here figured is 3 inches long, li inches 
high, and is 1;^ inches wide, with a bowl opening three-fourths of an 
inch in diameter, while that of the stem is only three-sixteenths of 
an inch. They are apparently intended for smoking without a separate 
stem, and in dimensions of bowl and stem cavities approached those of 
the curved-base mound pipes. This one is inade of a light gray ophio- 
lite and is finished with unusual skill, the surface having a glass-like

polish. Every exterior tool mark is obliterated. Tlie bowl lias what 
appears to be quite an uimecessary tbickuess on the side from the 
smoker, tliongb it is evidently not the result of accident. 

Fig. 202, from Tike County, Missouri, collected by iAIr. J. C. Watkius, 
is. made of a light-gray indurated clay, and is about the same size as 
the precediug specimen. Facing from the smoker there is carved the 

head of a bird or beast, it is 
impossible to say which; 
the surface, however, is 
merely smoothed, without 
effort at polishing, the crea- 
ture's eyes are cut in intag- 
lio, the mouth being indi- 
cated by a straight line cut 
into the stone. The head is 
slightly broader than the 
bowl, on the upper right- 
haud rim of which are eight 
incised lines, whether for 
ornament or as a record of some event it would be impossible to say. 
These bowls are evidently bored by means of tubular metal drills, as in- 
dicated by the uniform size of their perforations, though there is in the 
U. S. i^atioual Museum collection a specimen made of catlinite which 
was found in Baraboo, Sauk County, Wisconsin, which has been bored 
with a solid drill. The surfaces of this latter are merely smoothed, with- 
out effort at polish, the speci- 
men having evidently been 
blocked out by sawing. The 
pipes of this type in the col- 
lection of the U. S. National 
Museum are almost too few in 
number for one to draw defi- 
nite conclusions from, and 
while so different in exterior 
from the curved base niound 
pipes, there appears a kin- 
ship between the two in size 
of bowl and stem. Another 
pipe of this character was 
referred to by Mr. John P. 
Jones, in a letter to Dr. E. 
Missouri. 

Fig. 203, from Arizona, collected by Maj. J. W. Powell, is in form not 
unlike the familiar Powhatan pipe of commerce. It is made of a fine- 
grained red stone, ground into shape with great delicacy, the walls of 
the bowl being scarcely more than one sixteenth of an inch thick,though

the walls of tlie stein mny be oiie-eiiilitli of an inch, the diniensions of 
the pipe being approximately 1 inch in height, length, and breadth. 
Its characteristics would appear to indicate a recent period, Major 
Powell having obtained it from natives still using it. 

Fig. 204 is of similar type to the preceding figure and is from south- 
ern Utah. It was collected by Maj. J. W. Powell. 
Though larger than the last, being about 3 inches 
high and made from a translucent green stone, 
the walls of the bowl are as delicate and as thin 
as fine china, the pipes being evidently intended 
to be smoked with wood, reed, or bone stems. 
Though these pipes are evidently of Indian origin 
and finished Avith unusual skill their form appears 
to the writer to be due to white influences, as the 
pipes themselves are quite modern, though there 
has been no effort to polish them. 

Among the many pipes of the U. S. I^ational 
Museum and in other great collections there are 
occasionally encountered specimens which it is 

difficult to classify, owing to some peculiarity of material or of treat- 
ment, though the occurrence is so rare as to argue in favor of the cor- 
rectness of the unity of given types, esi^ecially when they are found 
to occur with scarcely an exception in contiguous geographical areas. 
It may be due in a measure to the fact of other pipes of a distinctive char- 
acter not having yet been discovered in sufficient quantities to enable 
the type to be well recognized, or it may well be and 
probably is to a great extent due to the fancy of their 
makers desiring to vary a prevailing type, or they 
were made by white people for sale to the Indians. 
That pipes of a given area should on occasion be 
found far from their natural home should not be sur- 
prising, when it is considered how great were the 
distances traveled at times by the Indians on hunting 
or war parties. Smith, in 1608, found articles of 
Eurojjean manufacture in possession of the Susque- 
hannocks, at the head of Chesapeake Bay, which had 
probably been obtained from the French on the St. 
Lawrence; and the French, in descending the Mis- 
sissippi, found the natives in possession of objects 
which had found their way over the mountains from 
the English along the seaboard, and heard from the 
natives also of the Spanish in the Southwest. The resemblance of 
natural objects of stone or wood to animal forms may possibly account 
for certain pipes having unusual shapes.

Edson, is quite a remarkable example of concretion of serpentine some-

what weather won I, which greatly resembles a bird upon a perch, yet 
it has on it four shallow depressious made by a solid drill point and 
along the side of the base a slight groove ground into the stone, slightly 
smoothed, which constitutes every particle of artificial work on the 
whole specimen, all of which could not have required one hour's time. 
The object is 5 inches long and 3.^ inches high, Avith a width of If 
inches. The body appears like that of a bird, is well formed, and of so 
distinct a character as to have suggested to many persons that a 
parrot was here represented, and the drill marks and grinding tool 
have been brought into play to heighten the resemblance. The pipes 
herein referred to as not x)roperly belonging to any type described 
may upon further investigation be assigned to some one or other of 
the dozen or more figured, or may be found to belong to types of 
■which there are examples in collections with which the writer is 
not familiar. They may be very ancient or possibly quite modern. 

It should be remembered, however, 
that among the American pipes arch- 
aeologists as a rule are prone to attach 
to them too great an antiquity, and 
consequently few pipes are described 
as belonging to the historic Indian.

now in the Metropolitan Museum in 
Central Park, New York. These show that water- worn pebbles were 
selected, exhibiting slightly an animal form, which the pipe maker 
picked into a more perfect animal shape, without much apparent design 
of imitating any particular species. These were the work of modern 
Indians and were greatly inferior to the specimens obtained from the 
mounds." ' 

Prof. Daniel Wilson sees matter worthy of note in the supposed corre- 
spondence between the ancient Peruvian tobacco mortars and the stone 
pipe of the mound builders, with their imitations of birds of the southern 
continent.^ 

Like resemblances may be observed between many objects from the 
southern and northern continents, though that there was relationship 
between them, especially in the pipes, will not be conceded at the pres- 
ent day, for there is no single instance in which a southern bird or 
animal has been recognized upon a mound pipe, nor, so far as the writer

SOUTHERN TYPES. 

These pipes, however, differ greatly from those found by Mr. Clarence 
B. IMoore in his extensive and very careful explorations made in Florida, 
in its mounds, which were commoid}' of the tyi)e having large bowls 
and stems, such as have been herein referred to. One of these, found 
in Grant mound, had a small ornament of sheet copper fastened by an 
encircling cord beneath the margin of the bowl facing the smoker which 
crumbled into dustui)on exposure to the air,^ and it is believed that the 
true Florida pipe will be found to 
belong to the large bowl and stem 
type, of which Mr. Moore luis found 
a number, both of stone and of 
earthenware. In the Steiner collec- 
tion, in the U. S. National Museum, 
there is an interesting pipe of stone 
from the Etowah mound in Bartow 
County, Georgia, the stem of which 
is broken off and upon which there 
is carved a grotesque figure facing 
the bowl, of which it is difficult to say whether the workman designing 
it intended it to represent a man or a monkey. 

Prof. Cyrus Thomas illustrates a pipe from Hollywood mound, in 
Eichmond County, Georgia, representing, he claims, the head of an 
owl, though he found in the same mound, <> feet below the surface, a 
fragment of blue porcelain, upon the surface of which there is the well- 
recognized head of a milch cow.^ 

This pipe, however, has the band upon it so commonly noticed 
among the pipes of iSTorth Carolina and Georgia. One of the most 
remarkable pipes which has come under the writer's notice is that 
referred to in a private letter of Col. Bennett IT. Young, of Louisville, 
Kentucky, the stem of which was covered with mica. "Very thin 
flakes were used in this ancient electroplating and by some kind of 
glue known to these people, the mica being rolled around the stem of 
the pipe and put on very artistically and in such manner that the chem-

ical clumges in tliesoil of at least five linndred years had not disturbed 
it in the least." 

Colonel Young thinks that, in Kentucky, pipes of stone antedate 
and are more numerous than clay pipes, the typical shapes of which 
are of animals, now and then birds, paroquettes being more numerous 
than other birds. Among the minerals employed in pipe manufac- 
ture he mentions oolitic limestone, 
gray limestone, bastard granite, slate, 
and frequently catlinite. Figures, he 
says, not always, but generally, face 
the smoker. The stems were of clay 
and also of reed. One pipe from Rich- 
mond, Madison County, Kentucky, 
was made from coral. In western 
Kentucky, on the Kentucky and 
Cumberland rivers, clay was always 
used, but pottery pipes are rare after 
passing Barren River, going east. 
Mr. Gates P. Thruston illustrates a type fiipe from the stone graves 
of Tennessee, which is closely allied to these pipes, the bowls of which 
are clasped in a person's arms; the peculiarity of one is that the 
head of the figure is attached to the pipe bowl and in front of it, 
the arms being represented with the open hands pressing against 
the breast; the legs are drawn up the bowl, projecting from the back.^ 
A fine-grained, small, calcareous brownstone pipe from Howard 
County, Missouri (fig. 206), collected 

by Mr. C. T. Turner, is only 2 inches --::::::':::— — .. 

long, has a square stem, and is a 
well-finished little specimen. On 
the side of the bowl away from the 
smoker a quaint human face has 
been cut by incisions to represent 
face, eyes, and nose, and from the 
top of the incision forming the face 
a number of gracefully curved lines 
arise, as though intended to rei^re- 
scnt plumes. While the bowl appears 
unique, its stem would indicate that 
it belonged to the Cherokee type. 

One of the most artistically symmetrical stone pipes of the U. S. 
Kational Museum collection (fig. 207) is from Bradley County, Tennessee, 
collected by Mr. J. P. Rogan, and is 3 inches long. The man's face is 
well executed, facing from the smoker, and appears to represent an 
Indian, upon whose face there are five gashes on the left cheek, as though 
intended to represent paint marks. The ear stands well out, and at the

back of the Lead the hair is plaited in a queue and attached to the stem 
so as to form a space between the queue and the head, by which a string- 
could be attached, if desired. The mouth and teeth are both prominent. 
The treatment of the head is unique, though the band on the stem 
appears to connect the pipe with those found in North Carolina, Georgia, 
and Tennessee, and shows in what varieties these jnpes are at times 
found. The material from which it is made is a compact stalagmite. 

Fig. L'OS, from a Georgia mound, shows in pottery identical treatment 
with the ])receding figure from Tennessee, though the treatment of the 
head is certainly very highly conventionalized and the queue and rim 
of the bowl, as well as the face marks, whether paint or tattoo, and the 
teeth would hardly be recognized were it not for the Tennessee stone 
specimens furnishing a guide with which the Georgia pipe may be 
compared. In fact the analogy in pipes from 
Georgia and Tennessee is often observed. 

Squier and Davis figure a clay pipe found 
opposite the mouth of the Hocking Kiver, in 
Virginia, "where there are abundant traces 
of an ancient peoj)le in the form of embank- 
ments, mounds, etc.,"^ which represents a 
head of a person whose hair appears to be 
d(me up more in the manner of the whites 
than that of the natives, and Jones also fig- 
ures one form which has the band upon the 
stem.-

A very remarkable instance of the distance which Indians will

stones in the bed of the river to carry home for the purpose of pipe 
manufacture, although they were then fully 500 miles from their

lodges,''' tlie reference to Jasper being' used for pipe making is i)robably 
erroneous. The stone referred to Avas more likely a serpentine. The 
ditJiculty of boring jasper would be very great without corundum or 
sand of simihir hardness, and when drilled its hardness would probably 
cause it to break from heating, on being smoked. In the several 
thousand pipes in the U. S. National Museum 
collections the writer does not recall having en- 
countered a single one of jasper, nor does he 
recall such a one being elsewhere described. 

This pipe of wood from Rhode Island (tig. 
210), collected by Mr. George Gibbs, is artisti- 
cally finished, being artistically carved in the 
round with more than ordinary skill. It is 3 
inches long, 4 inches high, with a width of If 
inches. To jirevent the bowl, which appears to 
be made of laurel or briar root, from burning- 
out, it has been lined with lead, which has 
been built up to prevent the bowl from burning 
through. This lead has been subsequently 
rubbed down so as to make a uniform surface. 
The figure is nude, represented as though sitting with one leg on 
each side of the stem, the elbows on the knees, and the head resting 
in the hands, as though the individual were in a brown study. While 
anatomically this figure may be open to criticism, the pose is decidedly 
graceful and the manipulation or tool work far from that of a novice. 

Mr, David Boyle has figured two 
most interesting stone pipes found 
in Ontario, which are nearly 5 and 
3 inches long, respectively, one 
made of a limestone and the other 
of a soapstone, the one from On- 
tario Count}" and the other from 
Durham County, each of Avhich is 
made in the shape of a turtle, exe- 
cuted with skill to the minutest 
detail of carving.^ 

Mr. Andrew E. Douglass has in 
his collection (fig. 211) a most inter- 
esting and highly ornate portrait 

pipe, which is said to have been found deep in a mine in San Salvador, 
Central America, which is of the most unique character in the writer's 
experience, it being made from a dark-blue or gray slate, similar to that 
worked on Queen Charlottes Island, in the Pacific. There are upon the

bowl tliiee himitiii faces, iioiie of Avliicli face the smoker, those oii the 
sides stiougly reseiiibliug masks. The pipe is 4i inches long, with a 
height of L* inches. On the underside of the stem there is a scroll-like 
handle, carved from the stone, slightly curved and rolling at each 
end, where it is attached to the stem, while around the end of 
the stem itself there is a band such as is ofteu encountered on the 
Southern Atlantic coast of the United States, but unknown on the 
Pacific in the writer's experience. This scroll-like handle is carved by 
one familiar with heavy metal and was said to be found 14 feet from the 
surface of a mine worked at the time of the conquest.' The face of this 
pipe on the far side of the bowl has a mustache. The pipe has been 
bored by means of a pointed steel tool. The writer was also shown by 
Mr. Douglass a photograph of a somewhat similar pipe which is in the 
Christie collection of the British Museum, which is said to have come 
from British Columbia. Another of this character, having only one 
head upon it, has a beard on the 
face, and is said to come from 
Pembina Eed River of the Xorth. 
These several specimens come 
from widely separate areas, 
though it aijpears to the writer 
that all of them originally 
started from the blue slate quar- 
ries out of which the Indians of 
Queen Charlottes Islands work 
so many really beautiful ob- 
jects. Just as the natives 
of the northwestern coast of 
America at the present day 
work pipes into many grotesque 

forms for the purpose of attracting the w hite man's fancy and conse- 
quently his money, so the writer imagines that the early European on 
the continent, along the Atlantic coast and the interior rivers and lakes, 
carved of the steatites and chlorites and indurated clays pipes of a 
character for which the Indian would pay the largest price in furs, and 
eventually traded to the Indian tools of hard metal fit to saw and 
scrape the softer stones suitable for tobacco pipes, a i)ractice which the 
Indian himself would follow, and we know from more than one source 
that he did imitate the white man's design. 

Fig. 212 is a rectangular pipe made of a dark-green serpentine. It is 
S^ inches long by 2^ inches in height, found in Indiana, collected by 
Mr. H. T. Woodman. It is smoothed over its whole surface and orna- 
mented by a double row of small holes bored into the bowl near the top 
and has a slight incision around the exterior of the rim encircling 
the bowl. This specimen is sufficiently distinct from other specimens 
to entitle it to a place by itself, though its age is probably re(!ent.

608 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 



ATLANTIC COAST PIPES. 

A most interesting type of pipe is found in the shell heaps south of 
the Hudson, certainly as far as Maryland, and perhaps yet farther, 
which appear related to certain tyj^es found in North Carolina, Georgia, 
and Tennessee, through a territory which at the first advent of the 
whites appears to have been inhabited by Algonquin, Siouan, and 
Iroquoian tribes, a more critical study of which will possibly connect 
them with pipes of the St. Lawrence River regions, especially those 
pipes with flaring bowls resembling brass hunting horns. There is an 
almost insurmountable difficulty in the study of any primitive handi- 
work of the American Indians, owing to the meager records preserved 
by those who came in first contact with them. From historical data 
there is room to suspect that many expeditions had reached the shores 
of what is now the United States and Canada between the years 1535 
and 1630 of which we have no records. The extent of their trade may 
possibly not have been far from the sight of the ocean, though from 
the first arrival of the colonists, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, or 
Swede, the trapper and trader sought the wilderness for skins. Of 
these expeditions little is known, for none of them, if successful, would 
inform his acquaintance of the rich fields of sport or trade, but saved 
his knowledge for future profit to himself. Throughout the early 
period the most bloodthirsty feuds were engendered between the tribes 
by French, Spanish, and English in their efforts to retain the trade of 
a tribe, or confederacy, or to divert it from their rivals. The proximity 
of the Atlantic coast to the tribes west of the Alleghenies was offset by 
the water transportation and short carries of the French from the St. 
Lawrence, Avho did not hesitate, it has been said, to publish false maps 
of the interior for the purpose of misleading the English. Lawson 
says in 1700, and with full knowledge of the conditions then existing, 
'" Tis a great misfortune that most of our travelers, who go to this vast 
continent in America, are persons of the meaner sort, and generally, of 
a very slender education; who being hired by the merchants to trade 
amongst the Indians, in which voyages they often spend several years, 
are yet, at their return incapable of giving any reasonable account 
of what they met withal in those remote parts; though the country 
abounds with curiosities worthy of a nice observation." ' 

ISTotwithstaudiug many interesting papers of those who imagine they 
observe evidences in implements made by the American Indian indi- 
cating left-handedness, Lawson observes of them, "When they cut with 
a knife the edge is toward them, whereas, Ave always cut and whittle 
from us. Nor did I ever see one of them left-handed." ^

We may imagine the process of drilling these long stemmed pipes, if 
made by the natives, by what this writer says of their using- the straight 
shaft as a boring tool in jierforatiiig shells, " Thus,'' he says, "they roll 
continually on their thighs with tlieir right hand, holding the bit of 
shell with their left, so in time they drill a hole cpiite through it, 
which is very tedious work; but esi^ecially in making their Ronoak, four 
of which will scarce make one length of wami)uui, the work was per- 
formed with a nail stuck in a cane or reed."' ' 

He further says of their work: "At spare hours the women make bas- 
kets and mats to lie upon, and those that are not extraordinary hunters 
make bowls, dishes, and spoons of gum wood and the tulii) tree; others, 
when they And a vein of white clay tit for their i)urpose, nuike tobacco 
pipes, all which are often transported to other Indians that perhaps 
have greater plenty of deer and game; so they buy with these manu- 
factures the raw skins, which they dress 
afterwards." - 

An almost black chlorite pipe (fig. 
213), .34 inches long, from Monroe 
County, Tennessee, collected by Mr. 
J. W. Emmert, has a uniformly smooth

creasing in the 2 inches of its length 

from one-half to one-fourth of an inch in diameter. There are several 
l)ipes in the U. S. National Museum collection of this character from 
the Lenoir burial place in North Carolina, the perforations in the bowls 
and stems of which appear to indicate the use of metal tools. A pipe 
of this character was found in a mound on New Kiver, southwestern 
Virginia, by Mr. H. 11. Flanagan. It is made of pottery, which has 
upon its surface those small indentations, or mill marks, noticeable on 
the English molded trade pipe. These indentations show, however, 
that they have been incised since the baking of the pipe and conse- 
quent hardening of the clay. 

A stone pipe, having all the characteristics of the English pipes of 
commerce, made from a material of light-brown color, was recently 
found on the Potomac River, near Shepherdstown, by Mr. Newton D. 
Sprecher. The same type is also found in the Lenoir burial place, made 
of a hard-burned black pottery. 

Fig. 214, collected by Mr. John P. Ilogan, is a pottery pipe, 4 inches 
long, decreasing in size from the bowl to the end of the stem. There 
is no indication of any wear caused by the teeth. The openings of the 
stems of pipes of this character are of a size indicating that they were

smoked witli ;i stem of ditterent material, tlie stem oi)enin^- decreasing 
from the orifice, as is noted in the tubuhir pipes from California, which 
had short bird-bone stems held in with asphaltum. Were these i)ipes 
smoked without other stems it is probable there would be indications 

of the wear of the teeth, as is at 
times noticed in the old English 
pipes, the stems of which are often 
worn through by the smoker's 
teeth, though Indian pipes seklom 
show such wear. This form is 
said by Dr. Abbott to be also 
found in New Jersey.^ 

A pipe of pottery from Fort 
Defiance, the Lenoir burial place, 
North Carolina, collected by Mr. J. P. Rogan (fig. 215), has no tempering 
material mixed with the clay from which it is made, a very noticeable 
occurrence in this type of pipes, and it is a matter deserving of partic- 
ular attention to see if other objects 
were made of such earthenware. 
The bowl of this pipe, which flares 
out more than any of the preceding 
specimens, has walls at least one- 
fourth of an inch thick. This pipe 
is quite rude in its finish, the marks 
of the tools with which it was made 
being still jierfectly distinct, the 
specimen being in outline not dis- 
tantly related either to the tubular pipe or to the pipes used by the 
English in trade. 

Fig. 216, of steatite, was found in a mound in Caldwell County, North 
Carolina, and was collected by Mr. J. P. Rogan. Its color is a light pink, 

the specimen being smoothed 
over its whole surface. The stone 
of which this pipe is made is ex- 
tremely soft, and had it been held 
between the teeth of the smoker 
it is scarcely possible that there 
would not be marks on its stem, 
which, however, is perfectly 
smooth. The characteristics of 
this specimen are similar to those 
of pottery pipes, even in the thinness of the walls of both bowl and 
stem, which are scarcely if at all in excess of a sixteenth of an inch 
thick.

North Carolina, collected by Prof. W. C. Kerr, of Raleigb. It is ({.^ incbes 
long, worked out with unusual skill, there being embossed on the bowl 
three circular decorations or eyes, the interiors of which are covered by 
a network of straight lines crossing each other at different angles, a 
fourth eye being in the form of a parallelogram with a number of cir- 
cles, cue inside the other. Running uj) the bowl from the stem there 
is a tongue shaped decoration wh'cli connects this specimen with pipes 
of the other forms from 
the same area. The 
stem at its junctuie 
with the bowl is not 
more than tive-eighths 
of an inch in diame- 
ter, and is covered its 
entire length with en- 
circling lines about 
half inch apart, be- 
tween which are incised oruameutal lines running from one circling 
line to the other in graceful manner. 

This type is at times found in the shell heaps of Maryland, made 
from a bright red or jiink i)ottery of homogeneous texture, which 
is ornamented in a somewhat similar manner, one of which, resem- 
bling the trade pipe, was found on the surface in Wicomico County 
and is now in the collection of the Maryland Academy of Sciences in 
Baltimore. 

There is in the collection of the University of Pennsylvania a most 
ornate bright red clay pipe having four groups of crossed lines in sepa- 
rate panels; along the outside of each panel, running up and down the 
bowl, are a series of dots, all of which at first glance would pass for 

imitations of the 
cord marks so com- 
monly seen on In- 
dian ])ottGry. The 
exact regularity of 
these dots, two at 
the side of each line 
of the panel, cause 
Mr. Stewart Culin 
to suggest that these panels are intended to be employed after the man- 
ner of the wampum belt, which api)ears to the writer to be possible. 

A dark red, almost purple, si>ecimen (fig. 218) of chlorite was found 
in a mound in Caldwell County, North Carolina, collected by Mr. J. P. 
Itogan. This delicately finished pipe is 11 inches long and from the 
base of the stem to the top of the bowl is scarcely i^ inches in height, 
with a diameter across the exterior of the bowl of 1| inches; the stem 
is 9;^ inches and has a diameter at its juncture with the bowl very

slightly iu excess of lialf an inch, which gnidually decreases to one- 
fourth of an inch at the point, the whole stem being bored by means of 
a solid drill. The bowl has a flaring rim, and at the base of the stem a 
tongue is worked out of the stone in low relief on the bowl, reaching 
two thirds of the way to the top as though made in imitation of a 
similar specimen of metal. 

Though the tool niarks are carefjilly obliterated from the stem, there 
is visible on the bowl a number of line, straight, parallel lines, which 
suggest the i^robable use of a metal tile. When the length of this pipe 
is considered it Avill readily be perceived how delicate was the manipu- 
lation of the tool not to break the stem in boring it. The length and 
delicacy of the stem would suggest that such an implement would be 
owned by individuals having sedentary habits, for otherwise its length 
of stem would make it liable to break in being carried from point to 
j)oint. On this pipe, as has so often been observed of others, the mark 
of the teeth is not noticeable. 

The writer's attention has been called to two pipes in the Essex

County collection of the Peabody Academy of Science, in Salem, 
Massachusetts, very much of the character of the last figure, except, 
possibly, that the edge of the bowl does not flare out in so pronounced 
a manner. These pipes are about <> inches long, are made of soapstone, 
and were found in Indian graves, which, from their great similarity to 
the southern specimens of the same type (fig. 219), the writer would 
be inclined to consider of a date subsequent to English settlement in 
the country. 

SOUTHERN MOUND PIPES. 

Fig. 220 is a dark green serpentine pipe, from Monroe County, Ten- 
nessee, collected by Mr. J. W. Emmert, which, because of the difterence 
in the size of its stem opening and the enlarged band on the end of the 
stem, necessitates its being placed in a separate class, though the tongue- 
like appearance on the bowl shows it to be related to the pipes which 
we have described with similar decoration. Such pipes are evidently 
intended to be smoked by means of separate stems, and while the tongue 
■would indicate a metal prototype, the band or enlargement of the stem 
would suggest it was copied from a plastic model. Pipes of this type

are substantially made, and tlieir surfaces are carefully ground, this 
specimen being 3 inclies long. 

Fig. 221 is a dark green chlorite pipe collected by Mr. J. W. Emmert 
in Loudon County, Tennessee. It retains the type characteristics of 
tongue and band, and in addition there is a disk 
carved in relief on the base of the bowl, which is 
almost convint'ing that it is in imitation of a copper 
or other metal original, as the embo.ssed disks on many 
of these pipes are identical with hammered metal, 
which is not unlike very similar fig- 
ures observed on sheet copper found 
in mounds by Mr. Clarence E. Moore 
on the St. Johns Eiver, Florida.' 
In the Douglass collection there are 
a number of pipes of 
this type, one of which 
has an eye-like figure 
cut into the bowl. Thej' are nmde of steatite, one of 
which, 14 inches long, was found in Sevier County, 
Tennessee. This type is also found 
in the Etowah Mound, Bartow 
County, Georgia, and other speci- 
mens in the U. S. National Museum 
have been found in other parts of 
these States and in South Caro- 
lina. On the last pipe figured the 
tile mark appears again in evidence. 
The embossed circles vary in number from two to ten or more, and 
the specimens of this type from the Lenoir burial place in North Caro- 
lina and those from Loudon County, Tennessee, leave little room to 

doubt that both come from 
the same quarry. 

Fig. 222 is a chloiite pipe 
from Toco Mound, Monroe 
County, Tennessee, col-

and 1| inches high, and 
has six of the embossed 
disks upon the bowl. The 
usual band on the stem, 
however, is absent; nor are there on this specimen any file marks dis- 
tinguishable.

Jirdonstou, and, though the type characteristics are accurate in a 
measure, the specimen has an extremely modern appearance, tile marks 
being quite distinguishable over the entire surface. The bowl is care- 
fully bored to a depth of l^^ inches, with an opening 1^ inches and of 

uniform diameter. Even the band on 
the stem has here become percepti- 
bly modified. 

Fig. 224 is a diminutive chlorite pipe 
from Caldwell County, IsTortli Carolina, 
collected by Mr. J. P. Rogau in the E. T. 
Lenoir burial place. It has a length 
of 1^ inches, with a heigiit of an inch, 
and is in every way a symmetrical, 
though diminutive, specimen. The em- 
bossed eyes, while as distinct and in as 
high relief from the general surface as 
are the others, are so ground as to 
leave them in separate groups of three 
on a side. They are so rounded down 
to the surrounding surface by friction 
on the side of the disks as gradually to lose their identity on their edges. 
In general characteristics tig. 225 is true to the type — though it is 
made of i)ottery — and was found in the Lenoir burial i)lace, Caldwell 
County, North Carolina, by Mr. J. P. Eogan. It is 2 inches long. 
The clay appears to be mixed with a large x^roportiou of mica for tem- 
pering. There are three disks in this instance on a side, while over the 
stem where it joins the bowl there is an enlargement, but neither band 
nor tongue. The similarities in the embossed circles on this pipe and 
those made of stone are most striking and unmistakable. The rim of 
the bowl is more pronounced than in any 
of the stone specimens, and into its outer 
edge eight notches are cut at intervals. 

There is in the Douglass collection a i)ot- 
tery pipe of this type from Mazeppa, Geor- 
gia, upon the stem of which appears the 
band, which, as observed in the figures 
illustrated, is not a constant occurrence, 
though quite common in this type. 

Mr. Clarence B. Moore, in his recent ex- 
ploration on the Georgia coast, illustrates 
an earthenware pipe (fig. 22G) with the stem 
band, upon the bowl of which are a number 

of these disks with flattened peripheries in high relief, and from a point 
just below the rim of the bowl to the stem there is a loop of pottery, as 
in the Tennessee specimen figured, which appears to connect the two.'

A plain bowl pipe from Tennessee, with (|uite n short stem, in the 
I)ou<;lass collection, has a similar loop. 

Fig. 227, also a i)ottery specimen, from the Etowah Mound, Bartow 
County, Georgia, collected by Dr. Ifoland Steiuer, is uiad(^ from a brick- 
red pottery, apparently containing no tempering. The ty])c is the 
same always, though in this specimen 
the disks are very pronounced and the 
edge of the bowl is flared ; encircling the 
bowl are a row of six of these knobs with 
rounded surfaces, below which are four 
others. The stem is partly broken, 
though enough remains to show that it 
flared, as does the bowl. 

Fig. 228 is also of pottery, found by 
Mr. J. P. Eogau in Bradley County, Ten- 
nessee. There is a difl'erence between 
this pipe and the others, though bowl 
and stem hold relative proportions in 
conformity to the type; the i)ottery is red 
and the bowl flares somewhat, though 
the stem is shorter than is usually the 
case, the bottom of the bowl resembling the curve of the human knee. 
Fig. 229 is in many respects similar in its characteristics to this tyi^e. 
This pipe is from Loudon County, Tennessee, and is made from a light- 
red clay, with very little admixture of tempering material. The bowl 
has a pronounced flare, and the specimen is 3 inches long, the top of 
the bowl being 2 inches wide. A peculiarity of the bowl of this pipe 
is that it is rectangular in its opening, as though a square plug had 

been driven into the clay while 
it was yet in its plastic con- 
dition. It was found by Mr. 
J. W. Enimert. 

Fig. 230 is made of an un- 
usually hard-burned pottery, 
which was found iu the Eto- 
wah Mound, Bartow County, 
Georgia, being about 3 inches 
long. The resemblance to the 
human leg in this figure is 
striking, the knee being 
slightly bent, the thigh form- 
ing the bowl, as the lower 
part of the leg does the stem, and above and below the supposed knee 
are a number of incised lines. As in the tubular pipe from the ruin of 
Sikyatki', New Mexico, bowl and stem each flare gradually. A pipe of 
similar form was found in the Lenoir burial i)lace, though without the 
incised lines, and is now in the collection of the U. S. National Museum.

A very similar pipe to this one made of light clay lound in Goorj^ia 
is ill the collection of the University of rennsylvania. 

All elaborate artistic pottery pipe belong! iig to the Steiner collection 
is on deposit in the IT. S. National jMnseum. Fig. 231 from the Etowah 
Mound in Bartow County, Georgia, is in quite a fragmentary condition, 

as both bowl and stem are badly broken, 
yet sntlicient remains to leave no doubt of 
its belonging to the type under discus- 
sion. The bowl is formed at the neck of 
a long-billed bird and is of the ordinary 
Indian pot form, excepting the luolonga- 
tion of the upper rim when it reenforces 
the bird's beak; there are encircling the 
bowl two rows of square pyramidal facets, 
one above the other; the bird's eye is 
neatly incised, the 
curve of the head be- 
ing distinct and the 
opening of the beak 
being represented by 
a straight line cut into the pottery, the whole hav- 
ing a pleasing individuality and representing an 
originality contrasting strongly with ordinary In- 
dian art, though somewhat similar to ])ipes found 
in Cayuga County, New York. 

Another specimen from 
the Etowah Mound in the 
Steiner collection (tig. 
232) shows a different 
treatment of botli the bowl and the bird's 
beak, the specimen being made of a light yel- 
low pottery. The flaring sides of the rim of 
the bowl, as well as the whole 
form of the same, is strikingly 
similar to the vessels held 
clasped in the arms of human 
figures, a pottery specimen of 
which was found in this mound, 
and another in Tennes.see. 
The beak here is opened, in 
which the bowl is modeled, 
the eye being smaller, though incised in a similar manner to that of 
the last figure; the band of the stem has more of a bead -like exterior 
tlian with any of the other ])ipes of this type. 

A tyjiical ])i[)e of this kind made also of i)ottery from Loudon Comity, 
Tennessee, collected by Mr. J. W. Emmert (fig. 233), shows the bird's

of the Iroquoian type, where tlie bird's beak extends far above the rim 
of the bowl, the bowl itself apparently being the pouch of the bird. 
While the treatment of the northern and the southern pipes is so dis- 
similar, there appears to the writer to be sufficient analogy to attribute 
a like artistic development to the i)ersons making the one and the other.

Fig. 234 represents a pipe from Camden County, (leorgia, collected 
by Mr. G. E. Floyd. It belongs also to the type we have been dis- 
cussing, though it presents an entirely new art concept. The specimen 
is of pottery; the bowl with its tiaring rim is severe in its simiilicity, 
the band on the stem remaining constant through most of the speci- 
mens of the type, though even this rule 
has its exceptions, and the bird's beak 
has disappeared from the bowl, though 
it reappears in the depression in the base 
of the stem under the bowl, in which a 
pottery ball yet remains adhering as 
when first modeled, apparently establish- 
ing quite an interesting conventional 
treatment of the beak of a bird. There is 
another specimen of this type from Har- 
din's farm in Blount County, Tennessee, 
slightly larger than the pipe figured from 
the U. S. National Museum collection. 

An extremely interesting specimen of 
this type of pipe is that represented in 
fig. 235, which was collected by Mr. 
Clarence B. Moore during the winter of 1897-98, in a momid on the 
Savannah River. It, like most pipes of this type, is made of clay. 
Opinions will probably differ as to the creature intended to be rep- 
resented: looking at the side view, one could argue that a bird or 
frog was imitated, while 
regarding the face view, 
it looks like some inde- 
finible monster. The 
type, however, is dis- 
tinct, and the locality 
in which it was discov- 
ered is well within the 
geographical area of 
which i^ipes of this 
class are found. This 
specimen is the most 
elaborate and in many 
respects one of the most 
interesting pipes with 
which the writer is 
acquainted. 

Fig. 236, from Loudon County, Tennessee, collected by Mr. J. W. 
Emmert, is made of a red pottery, without apparent tempering, and 
shows a somewhat difl'erent character of ornamentation in two serrated 
ridges, one running up in front of the bowl and the other from the 
stem up to the rim, while two serrated rows of ornamentation encircle

the curved bowl, making' a graceful whole. The bowls of pipes of this 

type vary from tliree-fourths of au iuch to au inch in interior diameter, 

while the stem hole is ordinarily about three-eighths of au inch. 
A pottery pipe from Nacooche, Georgia, collected by ivir. J. H. Nich- 
ols (fig. 237), is ornamented with cross fur- 
rows, leaving the whole surface of the bowl 
covere<l Avith low, rectangular pyramids, the 
short stem being' left perfectly i)lain, whereas 
the band on the stem is higher than is com- 
monly the case, being" shouldered on the inner 
side and rounded oft" to the stem opening, 
its periphery being serrated. This serrated 
stem band and the pyramidal ornaments 
all appear to have been cut out of the pot- 
tery subse(iuent 
to its baking. 
Upon the rim of 
the bowl, with 
its back to the 

smoker, there is perched, gracefully, a 

<lwarf-like bird form, the beak, eyes, ears, 

and tail of which are striking in their 

l)rominence; and while the resemblance 

in anatomical detail is but a caricature, 

one is forced almost to see an eftbrt to 

shape a likeness to the little screech owl 

of our woods. As a whole, this pipe must 

be considered as highly specialized and 

exhibiting artistic merit.

merit, and those of stone and ])ottery are so similar, tbe stone speci- 
mens often showing the file mark, as to impress one with the belief 
that the art concept of the whole series is that of the whites, even 
thonjih it should be contended that the manipulation were that of 
Indians. The resemblance surviving among French atid J^utch pipes 
of the present day would appear to indicate French origin rather than 
Dutch, especially when the treatment of the Cayuga clay pipes having 
bird beaks are compared with the Southern specimens. If this sur- 
mise be correct, then these pipes would appear to be contemporaneous 
with the early French settlements in the Carolinas. 

The French family names of the Carolinas attest the nationality of 
its settlers in the colonial period. Twenty years prior to the advent of 
Raleigh, Laudonierre, in 15C2, was sent by AdmiraJ Coligny, under a 
patent of Charles IX, to make a settlement in America, llibault having 
planted a colony of French at Port Eoyal Bay. These i^eople were all 
massacred by the Spanish in 1565, though a few years later, in 1579, we 
find the French Huguenots and Walloons settling in the Dutch Repub- 
lic' Man}^ of them settled in Acadia, and because of the edict of 
Nantes others settled in Carolina, and still others, after a short resi- 
dence in Canada and New York, went south because of the climate 
being more like that of France.^ 

When Nova Scotia surrendered to the British after the treaty of 
Utrecht in 1763, many Acadians refused to take the oath of allegiance, 
and 1500 were at one time transported to Charleston, South Carolina.^ 

In the French colonies young women recruits were enrolled in France 
and came to people America,'' just as the "redemptorists" were brought 
to America, and whose time was sold to reimburse the companies of 
shipi)ers who imported them under contract to be paid back by their 
labor. 

The earliest colonists "exported furs and peltries, much of which was 
procured from the Indians, which gave rise to a brisk trade between 
them and the settlers in the way of barter."' 

Anthony Park, one of the first settlers of the back country, who 
then lived in the Newberry district (1758), traveled a few hundred miles 
among the Indians west of the Allegheny Mountains. He found sev- 
eral white men, chiefly Irish or Scotch, who said they had lived as much 
as twenty years among the Indians, a few from forty to fifty, and one 
sixty years, who must have taken up his residence 100 miles west of 
Charleston before the close of the seventeenth century,*^ and these are 
the people who would naturally introduce ornamental pipes among the 
natives as articles of trade, having no source of suj)ply other than t])e 
country afforded.

Tobacco bad a superstitious value, according" to Dr. Everard, who iu 
1659 said: "The devil was much afraid of it, as I was iuforined by one 
born in England of Spanish parentage.'" 

Lawson, in his history of Carolina, says: "The women smoke tobacco; 
they have pipes whose heads are cut out of stone and will hold an 
ounce of tobacco and some much less." ^ 

The writer has seen a clay pipe from (leorgia, the bowl of which 
would readily hold an ounce of tobacco. That the Steiner i)ipes, which 
were found in and near the Etowah Mound, Georgia, and those found 
iu the Lenoir bui ial place, North Carolina, as well as certain specimens 
found elsewhere in Georgia and Tennessee, whether made of stone or 
l)ottery, were nuide by the same people there does not appear reason to 
doubt. From their striking resemblance to each other they must have a 
common origin. 

Gen. Gates P. Thruston, speaking of pipestems, says they are of 
uniform diameter, "for a closely-fitting reed or cane stem probably 
belongs to a type comparatively modern, as this appears to be the 
usual stem hole drilled by the historic Indians." ^ 

Bartram, about 1773, who was well acquainted with the natives of 
the region we have been discussing, says: "As to mechanic arts or 
manufactures, they have scarcely anything worth observation. The 
men perform nothing except erecting their mean habitations, forming 
their canoes, stone i)ipes, etc."'' 

In 1737 Brickell said of the North Carolina Indians : " In general, they 
are great smokers of tobacco (in their language 'uppowoc'), which 
they tell us they had before the Europeans made any discoveries in 
that country, and although they are great smokers, yet they are never 
known to chew or make it into snuff, but will very freely take a pinch 
of snuff out of a European's box." •' 

The color of the chlorite of which many of these pipes are made indi- 
cates their form to be derived from copper originals. The embossed 
eyes are identical with what would be produced by hammering thin 
sheet copper, though there may have been and probably were wooden 
l)ipes of the different kinds which have been used in different parts of 
the continent. 

Bartram describes the Cherokee smoking custom of a century ago in 
the Southern States. He says: "After partaking of this simple but 
healthy and liberal collation and the dishes cleared off", tobacco and 
pipes were brought and the chief, tilling one of them, whose stem, 
about 4 feet long, was sheathed in a beautiful speckled snake's skin 
and adorned with feathers and strings of wampum, lights it and 
smokes a few whiffs, pufltiug the smoke first toward the sun, then to

the four cardinal ])oiuts, and lastly over my breast, hands it toward me, 
which I cheerfully received from him, and we fell into conversation."' 
Brickell speaks of the heads of these pipes in 1737, which are gener- 
ally cut out of stone, as being very large, "the shanks whereof are 
made of hollow cane.'"^ 

Fig. 239 is an extremely interesting pipe, 3i inches long and 1^ inches 
high, 'found among a number of bones in digging a well on the bluff at 
Baden, a northern suburb of St. Louis. With it, about G feet below 
the surface, were fouud a few arrowheads, indicating that it was an 
Indian grave. There is evidence in its makeup that shows a curious 
combination of savage and civilized ingenuity, resembling greatly the 
combination pipes of the northwest coast. The body of the specimen 

is composed of a close-grained 
hard wood, shaped to resemble 
a bird; the mouth is indicated 
by an incision on each side of the 
bill ; to represent the eyes a stiff 
copper wire has been inserted 
through the head and smoothed 
^'s -^^ even with the surface of the 

wood ; on each side, probably in- 
dicating the bird's wings, there 
is a copper plate, held in position 
by rivets of the same metal ; on the breast of the bird there is let into the 
wood a plate of copper, fastened by three rivets ; the bowl of a typical 
English trade pipe has been sawed off at the base and inserted tightly 
into the bird's back and is connected with a stem drilled from the bird's 
tail, and had to be smoked with a separate stem. This pipe is now in 
the Douglass collection and has been illustrated by Dr. E. A. Barber.^ 
In a somewhat careful search for illustrations of early jiipes the 
results have not been encouraging, one of the earliest writers to figure 
them being Neander, who, in 1()2G, illustrates five Persian pipes of 
forms different from those with which we in America are familiar.^ 

Though this is significant of the wonderful spread in a few years of 
the use of tobacco. 

The Indian in his savage life may be considered i^eculiar in his offer- 
ings of tobacco to allay storms on the water, but was he different in 
his superstitions to nations of the Old World, where we find that the 
Roman, according to Gibbon, "deprecated the wrath of the Tiber," 
nor could he deride the Egyptian who presented his offering to the 
beneficent genius of the 2:^ile?'^

AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 623 
SUMMARY. 

The rich collectious in the IT. S. National Museum of pipes of Ameri- 
can aborigines, both ancient and modern, suggested this pa[)er. These 
collections were made from the graves of the Indians, by contributions 
from public-spirited citizens anxious to preserve records of the natives 
and of their manners and customs, in addition to which modern specimens 
have been obtained by purchase from the natives themselves. As a 
conseiiuence, the genuineness of these pipes may, it is believed, be relied 
upon. That data necessary to as perfect an understanding as i)08sible 
should be obtained, specimens in other public museums and in private col- 
lections were, so far as possible, separately examined; and when this was 
not convenient, the desired information was obtained by correspondence. 
Few if any works have been written on the subject, yet many papers 
relating to it have been published in magazines and periodicals, and 
most works referring to early American travels have valuable references 
to the smoking customs or pipes of the natives. These have all, so far 
as possible, been consulted and referred to in the progress of the work, 
which has extended over a period of three years. The writer trusts that 
but few important references have been overlooked in the mass of liter- 
ature consulted. It is hoi)ed that the paper includes sufticient material 
for intelligent criticism of the correctness of opinions expressed, which 
at times are in conflict with accepted theories. 

The subject was begun with no other view than to describe American 
pipes and smoking customs; the study of the subject has apparently 
developed information regarding manufacture of pipes, and consequently 
of other stone, bone, wood, metal, and i:)ottery objects, that it is thought 
may be of interest in the general investigation of American archaeology. 

There has been undoubtedly a tendency to attribute great age to all 
American Indian grave finds, a view apparently contradictory to the 
results of careful inspection of many of the objects unearthed. 

Smoke in some form, even that inhaled and exhaled through tubes, 
is shown to have been employed in Europe and in Asia from an antiq- 
uity long preceding the Christian era. In North America the smok- 
ing customs of the natives antedate the arrival of the whites on the 
continent, and from the similarity both of smoking customs and of the 
tubes employed in smoking in widely separated parts of the country, 
there is every indication that they must have prevailed for centuries. 

In Europe, Asia, and America, up to a period i^robably as recent as 
the first half of the seventeenth century, the employment of smoke 
appears to have been chiefly, if not entirely, due to its supposed medic- 
inal properties, added to which the Indians used it in their functions 
of every kind, attaching at times mysterious i^roperties to the plants 
from which the smoke was produced. The ofleriugs of incense by the 
Aztecs to the Spanish invaders under Oortez were in many instances 
similar to the familiar pipe customs of the Indian, and pipes of like

shape are traced from southern Mexico to the British possessions in 
the uortli. 

From the first advent of the Spanish they appear to have adopted 
the habit of smoking from the natives, the reasons tlierefor being that 
it alhiyed hunger or fatigue in addition to many medicinal properties 
which it was said to possess. The French in turn, and for like reason, 
appear to have adopted its use, and finally the English took to smoking, 
the example being set by Sir Walter Raleigh, a favorite of the Court 
of Queen Elizabeth, who herself does not appear to have been averse 
to use of the weed ujmn certain occasions. The ravages of the plague 
during the first three fourths of the seventeenth centuiy appears to 
have been one of the chief causes of the rapid spread of the use of 
tobacco throughout the world, for in an incredibly short space of time 
the custom had iraveled around the earth, again entering America by 
way of Asia on the west. 

So far as appears to be now known, the North American natives at 
the time of the advent of the whites do not seem to have confined 
their smoking to the tobacco i^lant, nor do they do so even at the pres- 
ent daj^, but employed for that jjurpose sumac and willow, as well as 
many other i)lants, and at times insects and other ingredients, which 
were supi)Osed to impart desirable odors, as, for example, gums in Mex- 
ico and the musk of the muskrat in Maine. There appears to be no 
evidence that native cultivation could have supplied any great quantity 
of herbs used in smoking prior to the advent of the whites. After the 
coming of Spanish, French, and English, cultivation of the tobacco 
plant probably had much to do with the spread of its use. 

To the whites, who for a century or more used tobacco as a panacea 
for every ailment of the body, must be given the credit, if it be a credit, 
which many will doubt, of adopting the habit of smoking as a pastime. 
Owing to the tales of early travelers to America, the smoke of the 
tobacco plant was considered a specific for all diseases. In a short 
time the use of the plant came to be viewed as a vice. At first the 
medical faculty throughout Europe prescribed tobacco to be used in 
every imaginable way, at various times, from early morning to late 
night, on empty and on full stomachs, according to the fancy of the one 
j)rescribing it. It has been known as the " sacred herb," the " intoxi- 
cating plant," the " devil's oracle." Le Jeune in 1G33 spoke of the 
natives using it as " unhappy infidels, who spend their life in smoke 
and their eternity in flames;" though Dr. Everard, about 1659, the 
au.thor of a work on the subject entitled, " The panacea, or universal 
medicine," says : " The devil was much afraid of it, as I was informed 
by one born in England of Spanish parentage." 

The derivation of the word tobacco does not appear to be certain. 
One of the earliest references to the word, that by Oviedo, referred

tained in the earliest edition of the work, and when it did appear, it

was a bifurt-ated implement tbr()Ui;h which smoke was takeu by the 
nostrils, an implement probably used ofteuer in the nature of a snuf- 
fing tube. One of the chief objects of smoking by the natives through- 
out the ( 'Ontinent was to produce an intoxication, ecstasy, or delirium 
to the smoker. The names by which tobacco is known in all modern 
languages appears to be derived either from the American name, 
"tobacco,'' or from what appears to be a French or Brazilian name of 
the i^lant, "petun.'' 

The profits in Maryland and \^irginia on the growth of tobacco were 
so great during the early period of the English settlements in those 
colonies as to cause it to be grown to the exclusion of necessary vege- 
tables, the natural result of which on more than one occasion brought 
about famine and consequent suffering. 

Tlie Spanish were the first to use tobacco, then the French, though 
np to the time of Ealeigh's expedition it does not seem to have become 
a popular weed. After the return to England of the latter expedition, 
Thomas Hariot, who was a noted botanist and had been sent to America 
by Kaleigh in 1585. reported tobacco as being a plant which preserved 
the bodies of the natives in health, and that they were not acquainted 
with many diseases with which the English were afflicted; certainly a 
powerful argument in favor of the nse of a drng at a period when 
Europe was constantly being visited with Asiatic cholera, a pestilence 
greatly and deservedly dreaded owing to its ravages. 

The nse and abuse of tobacco became of such enormous proportions 
that both church and state felt called njion to curtail its use and culti- 
vation by every means in their power from fear, ai)i«ireutly, that the 
injurious effects of the use of the plant might effect not only the bodies 
of the citizens but the revenues of the state as well. To the fathers 
of the church the use of tobacco appeared to savor of idolatry and its 
suppression was suggested. King James I wrote his famous "coun- 
terblaste to tobacco ;" restrictive laws were passed concerning its use; 
enormous taxes were imposed upon its importation. Popes Urban VIII 
and Innocent IX issued decrees against its use and Sultan Amuret IV 
declared smoking a crime punishable with death. Beyond enhancing 
its value, no effect appears to have been had beyond increasing its 
use. 

In time the value of tobacco was equal, weight for weight, with silver, 
-and the size of the pipe diminished accordingly in Europe, and its effect 
was apparently felt in America as well. 

The mixtures of other plants by the Indians with tobacco has been 
designated kinnikineck, though this term does not appear to be con- 
fined to any specific mixture; the word, however, is commonly employed 
by the Indians of a large portion of the Continent, and by whites as 
well. 

Pipes, in which tobacco and other herbs have been smoked, are found 
scattered practically over the whole continent of iNlorth America, the

iudications beiug tbjit the custom of smokiuj? inevailed as far iiortli as

Pipes are made of an endless variety of substances, such as wood, 
bone, stone, antler, and metals, and combinations of such materials, 
though the majority of pipes are made of chlorite or steatite, minerals 
most suitable in every way for pipe manufacture. Specimens are 
quite commonly found made from most unsuitable materials, such, for 
example, as (piartzite and bone. A single specimen made from stone 
coal occurs. 

The different tyi)es of Indian pipes would appear to be as various as 
the material from which they were made, though practically all pipes 
may be classified as belonging to one or other of about a dozen forms, 
recognizable by the interior dimensions of the bowls and stems and 
their proportions one to the other. In given cases these proportions 
would naturally be governed by the snpjily of smoking materials or of 
suitable stuff from which to make proper stems. There are some 
exceptions to the rule, but they occur chiefly among the pipes of the 
northwest coast of the Continent, where style seems to be governed 
largely by the taste of the traveling public — the chief purchasers of 
these pipes. The same cause may be responsible for material, as is 
notably the case in walrus ivory pipes made and decorated by the 
Eskimo. The correctness of the classification is proven by the fact 
that pipes of similar type are found in contiguous areas with remarka- 
ble regularity. 

One tyi)e of pipe alone is found to be common practically to the 
whole Continent, and this type, a straight tube, is in form the most 
primitive of any. Where perforated through stone they have been 
drilled by means of the most primitive drill known, namely, a straight 
shaft revolved between the palms of the hands or between the hand 
and the workman's thigh. So far as known to the writer there is 
scarcely an exception to this rule, the boring of these tubes being 
started froiu each end. Both stem and bowl are subsequently enlarged 
by gouging. On the Pacific coast stems of bone were inserted and held 
in place by means of bitumen. As the Atlantic coast pipes show many 
of identical shape, the presumption is that they also had similar stems 
held in place in like numner or with gum. Again, these tubular pipes 
are seldom decorated or finished with anything approaching a glass 
jiolish until there is found on them carvings in the round, due to 
modern ideas and methods of work and often the use of metal tools. 

There are evidences in the earliest illustrations of the pipe that it 
was of tubular shai)e and smoked as one would smoke a straight tube; 
that is, by throwing back the head and holding the pipe peri)endicu- 
larly. Again, the use of the tubular pipe in certain aboriginal cere- 
monies at the most solemn junctures would suggest its greater antiq- 
uity over other forms, especially when we find great veneration paid 
to the tube wliich is not given to other types of pipe. Certain tra- 



AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. (527 

ditious also point to the tube as beiug the most ancient pipe of certain 
tribes. There is found in the State of Ohio, however, a tube which 
must not be confounded with tlie pipes. It is of stone and carries a 
glass polish, having been bored by means of a tubular metal drill to 
within an eighth of an inch of a tlat end, through the center of which 
a small hole had been bored into the tube. These tubes have great 
resonance, and are probably horns and quite modern in make. 

On the surfaces of tubular pipes there are observed at times incisions 
rudely rei)resenting animal forms. They appear to be totein.ic, and the 
technique of these ligures is from an artistic standpoint very inferior 
to the carvings in the round of later pipes of the tube type, so differ- 
ent, indeed, as to suggest an entirely distinct conception of art — the 
one purely aboriginal, the other api)arently owing its existence not 
only to the tools, but also to the manipulation of the whites. The more 
elaborate tubular pipes are usually composed of such stones as chlorite 
and steatite, both admirably suited to resist the heat engendered in 
smoking. The great variety observable in the tubular pipes of wood 
from the Hupa lieservation suggests their being modern, and intended 
rather to supply tourists' demands than to comjily with tribal conven- 
tionalisms. There are evidences that the tubular pi^je was smoked 
with the aid of pellets of i)ottery, or of stone, intended to prevent 
the escape of tobacco into the smoker's mouth. These pipes, for the 
reasons given, are presumed to be the most archaic of any in shape, 
probably continuing with little change until after the whites had 
become established in the country. 

A rectangular pottery pipe made of a glossy ware has been discov- 
ered among ^lexican ruins, and might raise a (question of age were it 
not that the ware itself is apparently modern, and some of the decora- 
tions on pipes of this character almost certainly are. While the pipe 
appears to belong to the northern part of the continent, records point 
to the cigarette and the cigar being of pre-Columbiau origin in the West 
India Islands; the pipe being rarely if ever found below Yucatan. 

The pipe next to that of tubular form most widely distributed is the 
bowl pipe, which consists merely of a bowl with a stem hole entering- 
through the wall of the bowl, necessitating that whatever stem was 
used should be held in position by lashings of leather bound around 
stem and bowl while wet, which when dried by its contraction would 
hold stem and bowl together as though made of a single piece. This 
lorm, however, is also a modern one, and specimens are consequently 
often difficult of determination as to age. This type, however, like the 
tubular pii)e, consists usually of stone specimens bored both bowl and 
stem by means of the solid drill point either of stone, or wood used with 
dry sand. The size of the stem hole is usually about one-third the 
diameter of that of the bowl. The exterior shapes of i)ipes of this type 
vary from the simi)lest cube to the most complex animal form, the 
exteriors at times being inlaid with metal or shell. It is in pipes of this 



628 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

type that we first eucouuter basal perforations made for the purpose of 
attach in j>' bowl to stem by thongs, thus makini;- their loss in the snow 
less likely. Tliis is an occurrence commonly noticeable in pipes of coun- 
tries where the winter snows remain long on the ground. Pipes of this 
type ave commonly found throughout the territory adjoining Lakes 
Ontario and Krie down through Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky, and into 
Tennessee and North Carolina, and along the coast up to the British 
possessions. The territory through which they are found and tlieir 
often graceful shape would suggest possible French iiitluences. 

Among the more elaborate specimens are many carved in imitation 
of animate figures, though the varied ornamentation encountered in 
pipes of this ty])e leaves much to be desired in reference to their origin. 
It is almost certain that some of these pipes have been made with tools 
of metal, though if so it of course would not be evidence that other- 
specimens were not made with the most primitive tools, which in a 
majority of instances appears to have been the case. The stems of the 
pijjes were more elaborate if iwssible than were the bowls, and the 
significance of pipe-stem decoration was to a great extent decii^herable 
by those familiar with their workmanship. Such decorations often 
were distinctly ideographic, the color and ornament of the pipe stems 
being at times significant of peace or war, though often it is known 
that the ornamentation was simply an evidence of woman's skill in 
beadwork, plaiting, or embroidery, or of the warrior's excellence in 
wood carving or combinations of color. The minuteness of description 
of stem ornamentation encountered in colonial writings, which usually 
only refer to the color of the pipe as- being red, white, or black, is an 
argument in favor of the plainness of the primitive pipe bowl. 

John Smith as early as 1G08 speaks of pipes of a size sufticient to 
beat out the brains of a man, which subsequent authors increased to a 
size sufticient to beat out the brains of a horse. There is but one pipe 
of ponderous size which would answer the most extravagant of the 
above requirements. It is usually carved in imitation of birds or beasts 
and is the heaviest of all the American pipes. The skill exhibited in 
making these pipes is astonishing -if they are to be attributed to abo- 
riginal art, as many do who are most familiar with the type. Speci- 
mens of this variety have been excavated from 15 to 18 feet under the 
surface, though too much weight .should not be given to this fact, as it 
is well known that the familiar English molded clay pipe of little over 
two hundred years ago has been repeatedly excavated in London at a 
depth of 12 or more feet below the surface, and from depths of from 6 
to 10 feet in America. A close scrutiny of a number of these ])ipes 
fails to develop indications on their surfaces of the employment of the 
implements of the whites in their manufacture, though they are carved 
perfectly in the round, and are at times (juite highly polished, both 
accomplishments suggesting white intluences. The stone ])ipes of 
Indian origin of whatever type rarely show wear of the smokers' teeth 



AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. ()29 

on the stem, even on those havint;' wood stems the marks of teeth are 
not observable, though in these bird pipes the wear of teeth has been 
noted. Pipes of this type iisnally have the bird or beast facing- from 
the smoker. Some of the features of these pipes suggest a close rela- 
tionship with pipes of the tubular shape. The localities , where this 
pipe is found are in the States of Kentucky, Tennessee, and the extreme 
western parts of West ^'irginia, ]S"orth and South Carolina, and northern 
Georgia. 

The Knglish, French, and Dutch all molded clay pipes which were 
used in the Indian trade until they came to be known as "trading" or 
"trade pipes." It does not appear certain where these pipes were first 
made, whether in England, France, or Holland, archaic specimens hav- 
ing been found in each country. The typical Dutch type being repre- 
sented in the U. S. National Museum in a specimen found in London 
and the no less typical English form in a specimen from Holland. 
French specimens of primitive English type are found having upon 
their stems stamps showing the lilies of France. An early so-called 
lioman type of clay pipe was found on the Susquehanna Kiver. Speci- 
mens of these pipes have been found in Indian graves along the 
Atlantic seaboard. Early in the colonial period trade pipes were used 
as gifts to the Indians from the whites. At first they are mentioned 
in small numbers, but later they are referred to in treaties by the gross. 

Another typical American pipe, though of foreign, probably English, 
origin, was the metal tomahawk pipe, with a pii)e bowl upon one side 
and a hatchet blade upon the other. The date of this pipe is not cer- 
tainly known, but it was probably before the time of the American 
lievolution. Specimens with a spear i^oint have been attributed to the 
French and those with the rounded battle-ax blade probably belonged 
to the Spanish. The tribes confederated in the different wars with 
French and English, and Spanish have moved so far from their original 
homes as to make it a matter of considerable difficulty to properly locate 
the origin of the different forms of this pipe. Before leaving the sub- 
ject of foreign-made jiipes it is well to mention the fact that j)ipes of 
the trade type made of clay and of metal have been found in various 
parts of Europe, and they have been alleged to be of great anticpiity, 
though the weight of authority appears to be against attributing to 
them an age prior to English settlements in America. 

The monitor pipe, so called from its resemblance to the war vessel 
of that name, is found throughout the Atlantic seaboard from South 
Carolina to the British possessions and from the Atlantic coast, as far 
west as Kentucky and Tennessee, with rare specimens farther west, as 
in Michigan and Missouri. As many of these pipes show upon their 
surfaces file marks and a practical glass polish and from the drilling of 
their bowls by means of metal drills, one is inclined to attribute to them 
a post-European date, notwithstanding the fact that they clearly belong 
to a typical mound tyi)e. The bowls of these in]}es, often show evi- 



630 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

deuces of being enlarged after drilling by gouging witli some implement. 
In contour many of these i)i[)es arc as graceful as any found on this 
Continent, their surface tinish being almost perfect while the walls of 
stem and bowl are finished with a delicacy difiicult to improve with any 
modern tools. These pipes are rarely orniiinented with incised lines, 
and so far as the writer recalls, never have upon their surfaces carved 
figures. 

A rectangular stone pipe, having a bowl at right angles to a long 
stem and having some creature (uawling over the front of the bowl, 
was made of steatite by means of sawing the stone into sliape and 
gouging the surface and finally completing the object with metal 
tools has been found along the seaboard, from Pennsylvania to Nova 
Scotia; and though attributed by many to a period antedating tlie 
whites, seems quite modern, and has upon its surface distinct file marks 
which could apparently only be made with the white man's file* 

One of the most pronounced types of aboriginal American pipes 
would by many be said to be the familiar Micmac pipe, found as far 
south as Ohio and Kentucky and from the Atlantic north of the (Ireat 
Lakes to the Pacific Ocean. Tliis i)ipe is commonly so profusely orna- 
mented and so often has its bowl bored by means of a tubular metal 
drill and is so uniformly finished with a file as to leave little doubt 
of its being made with modern metal tools. These pipes with their 
keel-like bases bored with from one to six holes for the purposes of 
attaching tassels and strings to prevent loss in the snow, are usually 
of most symmetrical shape. This pipe is still made in Labrador, and 
specimens are known that are finished with totemic figures upon their 
bowls, carved witli a skill and with characters that could scarcely be 
claimed to be Indian. 

The disk pipe, usually feund in the States of Illinois, Missouri, and 
Kentucky, with specimens from Ontario, are of mound type, though 
their outline is so similar to the jews'-harp as to raise suspicion that 
such an instrument furnished the model for the type. The jew's-harp 
was a common aiticile of barter with the natives, and on many occa- 
sions is mentioned among presents given at some treaty made at a 
council meeting between the whites and Indians. Specimens of this 
type made of catlinite would also suggest a modern period for the origin 
of the type, for there is douht whether catlinite was ever traded so far 
from the quarries until subsequent to the advent of the Freuch. 

The Iroquoian pipes found along the river St. Lawrence and in the 
neighborhood of the Great Lakes may be said to vary one from the 
other more than pipes found in the eastern United States. First they 
were curved clay pipes having bowl and stem in one; then pipes 
made of a stalagnia, the .straight stems of which are at right angles 
almost with the bowls, and finally stone pipes of the bowl type for sep- 
arate steins of wood. All three of these pipes are found in the area 
of influence of the Iroquoian confederacy and with scarcely an excep- 



AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 631 

tioii preseutiug" i)ecaliarities of workmanship wliicli render tliem 
readily distinguishable. These pipes with but slight doubt show that 
their period is subsequent to the arrival of the French. The curved 
clay pipes are usually of a hard burned pottery with fine tempering 
material, molded in artistic forms, and at times the pottery itself 
appears to be cut subsequent to burning. The sliapes of these pipes 
suggest the hunting born, the grenadier's liat, vsacred pictures, etc. 
The grenadier type is retained in the pipes of stalagma. In the bowl 
type there appears to be a suggestion in several specimeusof the jump- 
ing jack. In all three are i)eculiar depressions upon the surfaces 
of specimens suggesting the possibility of their being intended for 
inlaying. There are so many European characteristics in pipes of the 
Iroquoian type as to leave scarcely a doubt of their deriving their 
forms entirely from the French. The art concepts present both the 
serious and grotesque in a manner more suggestive of the French than 
of native American ideas. 

The word ••calumet," a synonym for the peace pipe, is said to be 
derived from the Xorman Avord ••chalumeau,"'' a reed. The same word 
is corrupted as "chalmy,"' a musical instrument of the time of (Jueen 
Elizabeth. Calumet originally was emi)loyed to designate that pipe, 
of whatsoever type, used between the whites and the Indians in their 
negotiations of treaties and of commerce of every kind. The word 
calumet, at present, however, may be said to indicate that pipe which 
was probably the one given to the Jesuit Father Marquette in his first 
trip down the Mississippi, namely, the red Siouan catlinite pipe, the 
stone being a vermilion -colored indurated clay, quarried in the State of 
Minnesota. The Siouan pipe has a high bowl, always rising at right 
angles to the stem, and has a long i)rojection or prow on the opposite 
side of the bowl from the stem. In the older specimens bowl and stem 
holes are ai)proximately of the same size, about one-third of an inch in 
diameter. The earlier specimens are smoothed and unornamented, 
while the later ones are highly polished, and often inlaid with plates of 
lead, and at times even have duplicate bowls. This type was originally 
used by the French as a flag of truce, because accepted in Marquette's 
trip down the Mississippi by affiliated tribes, who by its decorations 
and tjpe probably recognized it as coming from friends; but it appears 
even on that occasion to have been ignored by Indians visited on the 
lower nnvt of the river. 

The English were probably the first to use as a flag of truce the col- 
lar or belt of wampum, just as the French did the pipe. Later, because 
of the want of a written language, both pipe and wampum belt seem to 
have been commonly employed as a reminder of agreements entered 
into between the Avhites and natives, a species of temporary ideograph, 
which after having answered the full purpose of one treaty or contract 
could later be used for another. The decorations of pipe and belt 
appear to have been considered in sections or chapters, as it were, 



632 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

between each of Avliieli i)i'eseuts were usually excliaiijicd wlieu a tieaty 
was in progress of negotiation. This ideograph was used when treaties 
were made with the Indians, who were accompanied by a regular dele- 
gation, whose duty it seems to have been to see that the chapters or 
stations of the belt or pipe were properly repeated hj its bearer and to 
interrupt his speech whenever not correctly repeated as agreed upon 
by the tribe. The individual pipe was often employed as a pledge, 
which when deposited must always be redeemed according to the strict 
letter of the agreement. The commonly accepted theory of the great 
sanctity of the pipe of ])eace as a protection to those accomi)anying it 
does not historically apiiear to have been well founded. 

The calumet dance of the Indians seems to have been widespread 
through the continent, so far as may be judged by the meager references 
we have to it. It was a function of some religious or mystic character, 
extensive presents being givenaipon the occasion, the individual danced 
to or for being considered thereafter to be an adopted child of the 
dancer. The flag of the United States, after the cession of Louisiana, 
was used in place of the French pipe in the acquired territory. Such 
agreements were later evidenced further on the part of the United 
States by the presentation of medals bearing the head of the then 
President or "Great Father,'' as he was called by the Indians, The 
red color, designating war, and the white, peace, was possibly sug- 
gested by the colors respectively of French and English flags. 

The typical, elaborate, and artistic curved -base mound ]>ipes, found 
to be contemporaneous with copper imx)lements, are drilled by means 
of tubular and solid drills, almost necessarily made of metal. In cer- 
tain instances the shapes of bowl cavities are of an irregular form, 
indicative of the use of a loose drill head; which supposition, if correct, 
would suggest the use of either a pump or strap drill, probably the 
former, either of which implements ai)pear3 to have been unknown to 
the natives prior to the advent of the whites. The polishing of this 
type of pipe is so perfect as to raise a suspicion of w^hite influences. 
The common observance on pipes of this type of marks which seem 
to be those of the file suggests white man's tools in fashioning them. 
The fine lines cut on many of these pipes would inJicate the possible 
use of steel tools; inlaid eyes suggest modern methods. Carving in 
the round as perfectly as is done in pipes of this type also implies 
modern influences and the presence of the white man, as do objects of 
copper covered with silver found in contact with these pipes. Besides 
this, the knowledge of the existence of the elephant and the finding in 
the mounds articles of undoubted European origin are all suggestive 
of the comparative modern date of pipes of the curved-base mound 
type. It does not of necessity follow that these pijies were of foreign 
manufacture, but probably they were the handiwork of fur traders and 
hunters catering to native trade demands. The figures on these pipes 
are doub*"less of totemic significance, and, with few exceptions, face the 



AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 633 

smoker; and where an excei^tion is noted, it is eoniiiionly observed that 
the stems on the front end have been brolceii. The figures beyond, being 
of men, beasts, birds, and reptiles,. are seldom of determinable species. 
The tinding of pipes of this type made of catlinite is indicative of 
modern intliiences, though by no means proof of it. The area of dis- 
tribution of this type conforms to the route of the early French 
voyageur and of the missionary. 

The double conoidal pipes commonly found along the Lower Missis- 
sippi and in the southern United States generally have large bowls 
and stems bored at right angles one to the other, the oi)enings of 
which art; an inch or more in diameter. They are almost always of 
stone, and are bored by means of a solid drill, though pottery specimens 
are known. These pipes vary enormously in exterior shape, all the way 
from the unornamented cube to the most elaborate animal form. Upon 
the bases of pipes of this type, which invariably face from the smoker 
and are often made of a gritty sandstone, are commoidy noticed deep 
grooves, apparently made for the purpose of sharpening some tool, 
though what, it is impossible to say. The frog is a form commonly en- 
countered in pipes of this type, though animal ligures are often found; 
where iu imitation of men, they are usually in crouching positions. 

A most elaborate type of pipe, which has been designated as the 
''idol pipe," and found in the mounds and stone graves of Georgia, 
Tennessee, and Arkansas, has some features suggesting a kinship with 
])ipes from the Etowah Mound, Georgia; but while these pipes appear 
to belong to a distinct type, too few of them are known to justify any 
definite opinion concerning them. 

During the colonial period there are often encountered references to 
"great pipes," which appear to have been pipes of large proportions 
compared with those of the usual type, and were the property of the 
tribe rather than of the clan or of the individual. Some few specimens 
of these pipes are known, which seem to have been made by the 
whites, of whose manufacture of pipes of this type one or more records 
are preserved. The Northwest Fur Company are said to have traded 
stone pipes with the Indians in exchange for furs; and John Smith, in 
Virginia, is known about 1008 to have asked permission of Powhatan 
to go through his territory to obtain stone for making axes, and the 
presumption forces itself upon one that the trade and manufacture of 
stone implements has been greater than is generally sui)posed. 

The natives certainly of a part of the far Northwest appear to have 
seen the first white people during the present century and to have first 
learned from them the smoking habit. Pipes of the Northwest coast 
are for the most part comparatively modern and made for sale, and 
consequently their shapes are as varied as the materials from which 
they are manufactured. The natives of Queen Charlottes Islands carve 
with metal tools most elaborate pipes from a blue slate, with most 
artistic and typical figures, though the pipes of this material are so 



634 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

diverse that little study has been given them, nor has reference been 
made particularly to the walrus-ivory etched pipes made for sale to the 
tourist and not for practical use. 

The Eskimo pipe in type api)ears to have derived its form from the 
Jai)anese pipe and to have been introduced from Jai)an, from whose 
l)eople the Eskimo seem to have adopted the smoking habit, or else 
this pipe may have been introduced from Kamchatka, whose people 
may have adopted smoking from the Japanese. 

The modern Pueblo i)i[)e is of a distinct type, resembling both in the 
character of its pottery and in the size of its stem opening the Irociuoian 
l^ipe. 

The form called the Delaware ])ipe appears to be of totemic char- 
acter, is carved witli considerable skill, and impresses one as being 
of recent origin and made with modern metal tools. 

Along a great part of the Atlantic coast a class of pi])es is found 
usually made of chlorite and worked with exquisite skill. Their long 
stems, bored with holes often 8 or even more inches in length, indi- 
cate that those using them were ratlier of sedentary than of- nomadic 
character. This perfection of boring would also suggest rather a metal 
than a more primitive drill. A pipe of this character is at times 
encountered in the shell heaps of the Middle .Vtlantic coast, upon which 
characteristic linear Indian etching is observed. 

There are found in graves and mounds in the Carolinas, in Georgia, 
and in Tennessee pipes of somewliat like character made of a green 
chlorite with embossed disks upon their bowls, and tongues both in 
relief and in intaglio, that show as great conventionality as any 
pipes found in America, and which would indicate in color and design 
hammered-inetal prototypes. Specimens presenting similar character- 
istics are found made of pottery. These last, again, grade into elabo- 
rate and highly conventionalized pottery man and bird forms, which 
present certain art characteristics observed in pipes found in part of 
the Iro(punan area of the Xorth, though there is sufficient distinctness 
between the two to enable one to be distinguished from the other. A 
single molded pottery pipe found in or near the Etowah mound has 
the tobacco leaf artistically arranged on bowl and stem, and a modern 
Dutch pipe from Guda, Holland, has the same tobacco leaves, with the 
addition of a bird's beak, identical in concept with pipes from the 
Etowah mound, evidencing a relationship which appears traceable 
through the Huguenots who went to Holland, migrated to French 
Acadia, and who, after the acquisition of the territory by the English, 
refused to take the oath of allegiance and were in great numbers 
transi)orted to the South. 

Specimens of catlinite made in tubular shape do not appear to have 
been found, and where specimens of other types than the Siouan, in 
whose territory the (juarry is located, are found made of catlinite, it 
tends to raise the question whether they are not comparatively mod-

ern. Wliilc the indurated clays and metamorpliic stones generally 
work well by pecking' with the stone hammer or point, catlinite, which 
there are indications was in the primitive period worked by pecking, 
is at the ])resent time worked by sawing, which is readily done with 
metal and sand. The drilling ol" this stone is comparatively simple 
with a stick and dry sand, which, however, if wet, would pack in the 
perforation besides swelling the wood point if one were used. Drilling 
in curves like the sui)posed evidences of hardening of copper by the 
ancients is a myth, and no evidence is known of its ever having been 
done by primitive people through any mass of uniform hardness. 

While, as a matter of course, it is possible to make i)ipes and pass 
them off as genuine and thus to deceive even exjjerts, it is believed 
that such a thing could not be successfully accomplished except in rare 
instances, and the writer has been surprised that in the mass of pipes 
that have been examined by him so few show any evidence of being 
frauds. On the other hand, the evidences of the use of the white man's 
tools as well as art ideas are on so many types of pipes as to convey the 
distinct impression of early colonial legitimate trade in stone objects. 
That totemic figures better enhance values is self evident. Is it to be 
assumed, then, that the voyagenr, trapper, or hunter would not with his 
knife or file make pipes to supply such demand. It must also be 
remembered that carving during the early colonial period was a mucli 
more prevalent accomplishment than at ]>resent. 

It has been observed that quite a number of pipes have beeu referred 
to upon which dates are scratched or cut, and while such specimens 
will always be scrutinized with suspicion, the dates in the majority of 
instances, it is contended, should be accepted as accurate, not neces- 
sarily of the period of their manufacture, but rather of their first pos- 
session by the wihte njan. 

As the data upon which the foregoing conclusions are based are 
embodied almost completely in the foregoing pages, students of the 
subject will, it is hoi)ed, be enabled to judge of their correctness. 

ADDITIONAL NOTES. 

During the prei)aration of this paper some notes were mislaid, others 
were laid aside and not found until the pa])er was in the printer's hands, 
and still others have come more recently to the writer's notice, making 
together quite a number of references, some of which throw additional 
light on the question under discussion, and it has consequently been con- 
sidered desirable to embody them as succinctly as possible in a brief 
series of additional notes. 

McCulloh, in the account of his captivity by the Indians, in Loudon's 
exceedingly rare work, refers to a iieculiar method of burial employed 
by the natives about 175(), which would appear very similar to the 
burial method of the peo])le of the stone graves in Kentucky and 
Tennessee. He says: "They dig the grave about 4 or 5 feet deep,

directly east and west; tliey make slabs wliicli tliey place in tlie bottom 
and at each side, then lay the corpse with the head to the east and put 
a broad slab over the top; then fill the grave nearly full of stones, 
heaping the earth which they dug out of it on tlie top." ' 

Tlie Indians encountered by the French were probably all nomads 
or wanderers, seldom remaining more than a few weeks in one place. 
It was said in Le Jeune's Kelation, as late as 1G34, "that we shall work a 
great deal and advance very little if we don't make these barbarians 
stationary. As for persuading them to till the soil of their own accord 
without being helped, I very much doubt whether we shall be able to 
attain this for a very long time, for they know nothing whatever about 
it." 2 

A reference of 1G36 in Le Jeune's Eelation to the head covering is of 
some interest as possibly throwing light on the period of certain x)ipes 
representing natives' hats or hoods, as follows: ''These people go bare- 
headed except in the most severe cold, and even then some of them go 
uncovered, wbich makes me think that very few of tbem used hats 
before their intercourse with our Europeans. Nor do they know how 
to make tbem, buying them already made, or at least cut, from our 
French people." ■' 

Mr. David Boyle, of Toronto, has referred to a brass tomahawk pipe 
in the George E. Laidlaw collection, on deposit in the Ontario Archfeo- 
Jogical Museum, which is "elaborately chased and otherwise decorated." 
The bit is of steel neatly dovetailed into the brass, but not soldered.^ 

The illustration of this specimen is of the type of fig. 85, the chasing 
being of the character of that on the specimen in the museum of the 
University of Pennsylvania from CaUfornia, and its symmetry is as 
perfect as any of the pipe axes of the English. It was found near 
Balsam Lake. 

McCulloh refers to an Indian of western Pennsylvania about 1750, 
named Ket tooh'ha-lend, who "sunk his pipe-tomahawk" into the head 
of another. ■' This would probably be the metal tomahawk, which 
would make it somewhat an older instrument than the writer had here- 
tofore found references to support. 

Mr. Boyle has recently described a number of pipes, ))Oth of pottery 
and of stone, that are now in the Ontario Archa'ological Museum, 
belonging to the Iroquoian type. Some of the pottery specimens

illustrated liave double foces ou their bowls, one facing toward and 
and the other facing- from the smoker, from Bexley. Township, Ontario.' 
Other of these illustrations would indicate masks. Mr. Boyle in his 
publications demonstrates the great diversity of exterior form of the 
Ontario pipe. The bowls and stem openings of the pottery specimens 
remain of type character, though a single one appears to have been 
enlarged for the reception of an artificial stem. 

Parkman's says that the Jesuits were reported to have carried ou 
trade through the savages for furs,' this primitive intercourse of a com- 
mercial character would have been a most effective method for opening 
the road to the missionaries through the territoiy of the savages, 
which once opened would afford opportunity for the spread of the 
doctrines of the church. 

The term " tabagie " or " tabagio," at times occurring in early French 
publications, is evidently derived from the word •' tobacco'' and has its 
origin in the smoking habit. Marc Lescarbot, in referring to a victory 
of the French and their Algonquin allies on July 29, 1609, over their 
Iroquoian enemies, speaks of it as a triumph which they celebrated 
with great festivities, consisting of continual tabagie, dances and 
chants, according to their custom. ' 

A reference by Biard about 1G32, that "the savage made tabagie for 
them all with moose meat,'' ^ would indicate that the term at this period 
had come to signify a feast, as it appears later to have become corrupted 
into "tapage", a row or noise. 

Father Pierre Biard, referring to demands of the Indians for tobacco 
in 1611, says the king should present him 4 or 5 pounds of bread, 3 of 
peas or beans, 1 of tobacco, 4 or 5 cloaks worth 100 sons each, bows, 
arrows, harpoons, and other similar articles.' 

As akin to customs existing in other parts of tlie country, reference 
is made in 1616, in Acadia, to the fact that, if the dying man has some 
supplies on hand, lie must make tabagie of them for all his relations 
and friends.*^ 

Biard, hi 1616, further says: ''They also use tobacco and inhale the 
smoke, as is done in France. This is without doubt a help to them, 
and upon the Avhole rather necessary, considering the extremes of cold 
and bad weather, and of hunger and of overeating and satiety which

they eudnre. But many ills also arise from it on account of its exces- 
sive use. It is the sole delight of these people when they have some 
of it, and certain Frenchmen are also so bewitched with it that to 
inhale its fumes they would sell their shirts. All their talks, treaties, 
welcomes, aiul endearments are made under the fumes of tobacco. 
They gather around the fire, chatting and passing- the pipe from hand 
to hand, enjoying themselves in this way for several hours, such is their 
inclination and custom,"' 

The area of French influence was continually widening as those wan- 
derers, the coureurs du bois, went farther and farther into the \vilder- 
ness in search of skins, until La Salle, in 1G70, appears to have arrived 
at the falls of the Ohio, where he was deserted by his peoide and was 
forced to return. 

Tobacco, according to Peter Heylyu, about 1682, was called the " Hen- 
bane of Peru," quoting "Gerard and some other of our modern herba- 
lists," but he says, "Tobacco is by few now taken as a medicine, and it 
is of late times grown a good fellow, and fallen from a i)hysiciau to a 
complaint. The taking of tobacco was first brought into England 
by the mariners of Sir Francis Drake in 1585, and it happened not 
unfittingly in the way of an antidote to that immoderate use of drink- 
ing which our low country soldiers had brought out of the Netherlands 
much about that time."^ 

If we can believe Jouvency, the moose would appear to have taken 
the place of tobacco as a universal medicine and remedy, for he says of 
it, about 1710, "The savages eat its flesh, are clothed with its skin, and 
are cured by the hoof of its left hind leg." He also says, "It avails 
against epilepsy, nor does it have less power with the cure of pleurisy 
and six hundred other diseases."-' 

As a suggestion probably throwing some light on the shape of those 
pipes resembling the human arm, that of Le Jeune referring to the 
Indians of Canada is of interest. He says: "Nearly all the savages 
have a little castijiitagan, or tobacco pouch, made of the skin of the 
muskrat. Some of them carry a part of an arm or a hand of a hiroquois 
whom they have slain, which is so skillfully prepared that the nails 
remain entire. You would really think it was a solid hand when they 
fill it with tobacco or something else. I have not seen any of these, but 
am assured that it is so." * 

According to Baron de Bonstetten, "In China, in India, in Persia 
they have smoked I'rom time immemorial the grain of hemp, like the 
Scythians of Herodotus. In Ceylon, Java, Siam, Japan, Cochin China,

a small clear i)Ool, wlieuce it was cousuined by tbe many parched 
mouths by sacking it up through hollo\y reindeer marrowbones, in 
exactly the same manner in which we enjoy a sherry cobbler through a 
straw/' ' 

Dr. Barber says: "The Pah Utes, according to Mr. Edward Palmer, 
use the leaves of Arctostaphylos tomentosa, the Manzauita of the Spanish, 
for tobacco and also as a medicine." 

Mr. A. E. Douglass has in his collection a very remarkable brown 
stone pipe, belonging to the biconical type in the form of a human 
head. It was found it is said about 100 feet from a small rock mound 
near Coolville, Athens County, Ohio. The mouth, apparently the 
bowl, shows that it has been bored out by means of a tubular drill as 
there is a jirotuberance at the bottom. The ears are carved to give 
the impression of having in them the familiar copper discoidal spools 
at times found in Ohio. The specimen jjresents every appearance of 
genuineness and some of its features are unique. It has been badly 
battered by children who have played with it. 

Prince Maximilian, of Wied, refers to some of the Indians of Indiana 
who smoked sumac leaves in wooden pipes. '-The Cherokees also of 
the Southern States used wooden pipes carved in the form of bears, 
the bowl being in the back and the tube orifice near the tail.''- 

The pipe here described might be the biconoidal pipes referred to, or 
possibly it might refer to a pipe illustrated by Schoolcraft and now in 
the museum of the University of Pennsylvania. This pipe is cut 
through a block of chlorite, which exteriorlj^ is of a rude animal shape, 
the legs being represented in low relief, as seen in fig. 157. The eye is 
cut into the stone. The stem opening of this pipe and the bowl, which 
were from Camden, South Carolina, are almost in the same plane and 
would entitle it to be classed rather with the tubular pipes than with 
another form. The surface of this pipe is black and glossy, and it 
would appear entitled to be classed among unique specimens, the form 
being apparently given by means of the hammer stone by pecking. 

Holm (piotes P. Lindstrom, about 1G50, who he says writes as fol- 
lows: "Their money is of shells, white, black, and red, and worked 
into beads and neatly turned and smoothed. One person, however, 
can not make more in a day than the value of six or eight stivers. 
When those beads are worn out so that they can not be strung neatly 
and evenly on the thread, they no longer consider them as good. 
Their way of trying them is to rub the whole thread full on their noses, 
and if they find it slides smooth and even, like glass beads, then they 
are considered good. Otherwise, they break and throw them away. 
Their manner of measuring the length of their strings is by their

thumbs. From tlie eud of the nail to the first joint makes six beads, 
of wliich the white ones are worth a stiver or piece of coi)|)er money, 
but the bhick or blue (mes are worth two stivers or a piece of silver." ' 
He says these beads are cut of brown or white cockle, muscle, or oyster 
shells.^ 

According to Georg Heinrich Loskiel the belts of wampum were reg- 
ulated iu size according to the importance of the subject intended to be 
discussed on the part of whites or Indians, and before they used the 
string or belt of wampum the wing of a large bird was used in its place. 
The belts and strings, he says, are employed to speak from and to 
remind one of business transactions. This is still used, he says, by 
those living west.'' 

The Swedes settled on the banks of the Delaware under Capt. 
David Pieterseu De Tries in 1()31, where he arrived with two shii:)S. 
" He returned again in 1632 and found the fields of his new colony 
strewed with the bones of his countrymen. The arms of Holland, 
emblazoned upon a piece of glittering tin, had been elevated upon a 
pillar. An Indian stole it to make a tobacco box. The commandant 
took offense; they quarreled; and the colonists were all butchered 
while at work in the field." ^ 

A broken specimen of a pipe of the heavy animal and bird type (fig. 
60), which is 4.^ inches high and made of steatite, collected by Dr. J. H. 
Elder about 3 miles from Watkinsville, Georgia, the bowl of which is 2i 
inches above the back of a bird, is an interesting specimen of the type, 
in that incised lines are cut into the stone to represent conveutioual 
wings of some bird, as we may distinguish by later specimens in 
which the wings are represented by being carved in a low relief. The 
head of the bird is represented also by incisions and, were it not for the 
conventionalized wings, might as well be taken for that of a turtle. 
Upon the side of the bowl a word or name, ai)parently Canonic or 
Ganonic, is incised, and under it the date 1541. The lines of the name 
appear as old as the incised lines, though the date is evidently recent. 
This pipe is apparently an old specimen of the type. 

A finely ground specimen of serpentine, belonging to the type of 
which fig. 108 is an example, collected by ]\Irs. Keeves of Sun Prairie, 
Wisconsin, has been called to the writer's attention by Prof. W. H. 
Holmes. The prong at the base has the unusual length of 4 inches 
from the point to the bottom of the bowl. The stem and bowl appear 
similar to the illustration, the hole of the stem being about one-eighth 
of an inch in diameter. There is scarcely sufficient bowl remaining to 
determine more than that its cavity has been made by means of a

solid drill point. rii)es of this character appear to belong to a dis- 
tinct type when it is considered over how extensive a territory speci- 
mens have been found, reaching from Tennessee to Wisconsin. The 
type has every indication of being modern. 

A photograph in the XJ. S. National Museum of a bird pipe of the 
type of tig". 121, collected by Maj. W. B. Camp, from Sacketts Harbor, 
New York, has a hole bored from side to side of the knob represent- 
ing the feet. The pipe is smoothly ground and apparently made of 
indurated clay. 

The natives of western Pennsylvania about 1700 are said according 
to Loudon to have made " burnt oflt'erings to their deceased relatives, 
such as tobacco, bread," etc. ' 

As did the natives of Virginia at the advent of the whites, and in 
this exceedingly rare work, it is related that Tecaughretanego, after 
building himself a sweat house and puritying himself therein, came 
out and began to pray and cast the last of his cherished tobacco into 
the fire; he then is said to have handed his white companion his pipe 
to smoke, though at that time he had nothing to smoke but red willow 
bark. ^ 

The mixture of other plants with tobacco is here also noted and the 
friendly smoking referred to. "They are," it is said, "very fond of 
tobacco and the men almost all smoke it mixed with sumac leaves or 
red willow bark pulverized,'' and these Indians are said seldom to use 
it any other way.-' 

The conjurer's or medicine man's i^ractices appear identical with those 
in other parts of the continent, as related in McCulloh's Narrative, 
contained in this work, in which the scene is described of a woman who 
places her hands one over the other upon a boil and sucking the hand 
and pretending to hand something from the moutli to the medicine 
man, who stepped out of the hut. A few days later he returns and 
smokes "qush-a-tik ok killick ken-eek can;" that is, tobacco and 
mixture such as sumac leaves, red sally bark."^ 

Kalm refers to the wam])um about 1749. He says: "Many people 
at Albany make the wampum of the Indians, which is their ornament 
and their money, by grinding some kind of shells and muscles. This is 
a considerable profit to the inhabitants."' 

Soon after the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth, in December, 
1620, namely, March 10, 1621, " Samoset came boldly among them and 
spoke to them in broken English, which yet they could understand, at 
which they marveled, but at length they understood that he belonged 
to the eastern parts of the country, and had acquaintance with sundry

of the English fishermen, and coiikl name certain of them from whom 
he learned his language.'" This occurrence is only an additional 
instance of almost every account of the traveler's first contact with the 
natives — that some one else of the same color or nationality was there, 
or had been there before them. 

It is noteworthy that all references to the personal property of our 
American Indians indicate that it was inconsiderable. Peter Ileylyn, 
about 1082, referring to the natives of Virginia, especially that portiou 
known as ''Novem Belgium or Nieu Nederlandt," says: "Their house- 
hold stuff, a tobacco pipe, a wooden dish, and an hatchet made of a 
broad fiint; their weapons, bows and arrows, their arrows headed with 
the bones of fishes."^ 

According to Everard, Clusius says, referring to Windaconoa, in 
1585, with whose natives numbers of the Ilaleigh expedition came in 
contact, •' The English returning from thence brought the like i)ij)es 
with them to drink the smoak of tobacco." ^ 

The native American arts and handiwork are beginning to be some- 
what studied, and as a consequence a better untlerstanding is had of 
limits to implements of native manufacture than was possible a decade 
since. Among other writers on the subject Dr. Brinton has claimed to 
find evidences of left-handedness in North American aboriginal art, 
having noticed an appreciable percentage among arrowheads.^ If 
these views are correct, they differ from the experience of one authority 
herein quoted, who passed a considerable time among American sav- 
ages living under primitive conditions, nor does it appear to the writer 
that the mere scrutiny of an arrow would be reliable as to how it 
would be held in process of manufacture, especially as blades in process 
of chipping are of necessity constantly reversed as the formation of 
the blade progresses. 

The Clioctaws, according to Dr. E. A. Barber, as well as the Mexi- 
cans, mixed their tobacco with the leaves of liquid amber. 

As showing the wide areas over which specimens of catlinite have 
been found, Mr. Charles C. Jones, in a letter to Dr. Barber, refers to a 
l)ipe of this material found in an ancient relic bed about 25 miles from 
Augusta, on the Savannah Kiver, in Georgia. 

There is in the Douglass collection, in Xew York City, a potteiy pipe 
from Franklin, Xorth Carolina, which resembles a snake holding a vase 
in its distended jaws. This pipe is of interest as related to the bird 
pipes of Georgia (fig. 231), and possibly to those of northern New York 
(fig. 115) as well. 

The Florida Indians during the first half of the sixteenth century, 
according to Cabe^a de Vaca, built their cabins of nmts on oyster-shell 
piles, on which they slept perfectly naked. They never, he says, build

fail to be of interest, as being probably the first of a white man's expe- 
rience witliin the confines of the territory north of Mexico. 

Jean Ribault, in February, 15C2, commanded for Coligny, who had 
secured a patent from Charles IX to colonize French Protestants in 
America, an expedition which sailed from Havre, France. At the end 
of April they reached the coast, and on May 1 discovered the river of 
May, now the St. Johns, Returning to their ships they sailed up the 
coast to Port Eoyal and located a fort not far oft". They left there a 
small garrison and then returned to Europe. Two years later Laudon- 
niere reached the coast, and in 1.5G5 there was not far from one thou- 
sand persons in the third expedition of Ribault, who were all massacred 
by the Spanish.^ 

The Pehuenches of Parana smoke by passing one pipe around. Each 
one fills himself until he can inhale no longer, holds his breath as long- 
as he can, aiul exhales through the nose. The Eskimo and the Japa- 
nese retain the smoke of a single whift' until they can endure it no 
longer.-' 

The natives of Patagonia are said to make wood or stone pipe bowls 
fitted with a silver or metal tube.' ''The smoker,'' he says, '"lights his 
pipe, then lies prone on the ground, and after puffing a portion of smoke 
to each cardinal point and muttering a prayer he swallows several 
mouthfuls of tobacco smoke, which produces intoxication and partial 
insensibility, lasting perhaps for the space of two minutes. The 
tobacco used for smoking (for they never chew) is generally obtained 
from the settlements, but failing in this a herb substitnte is procured from 
the xVraucanians. This is never smoked pure, being invariably mixed 
with either wood chopped up small or ' Yerba' [Paraguay tea] stalks if 
obtainable. The mixture with dung mentioned by M. Guinnard is 
unknown among the Tuelches."'' 

Certain of the natives of Terra del Fuego in 1822 were said to strike 
fire with iron pyrites against quartz. '' 

An early reference to incensing refers to Magellan's voyage where it 
is said, "Not far from Zubut lies the isle of Mathan. When a nmn of 
figure dies all the chief women go to his house, the room being incensed 
with myrrh and storax all the while." ' 

Mr. M. Eels, in a letter to Dr. E. A. IJarber in 187S, says that among 
the Twanas, a part of whom talk the Skwaksin dialect of the Isisqually

AMERICAN ABORIGINAL PIPES AND SMOKING CUSTOMS. 645 

Innjjuage, and the Clallams, at present, smoking is common, but lie 
could not learn tliat there was ever any smoking previous to the com- 
ing of the English and Americans sixty or eighty years ago. When the 
Hudson's Bay Company came, it became more common. ' 

The Haidasta, Dr. Barber says, use the bark of Conius stolon if era, 
also Corniis sericea., dried and jirepared for smoking. 

The Tunguses are said never to "travel without having a sort of 
censor hung on their arm (or little chafing dish). In throwing on tliis 
portable fire wood and half-dried herbs they stir up a great deal of odor 
to their fire which all the insects dislike." ^ The same author says the 
Lapps make this odor with sponge. 

Mr. Raphael Pumpelly writes Dr. Barber from Oswego, iTew York, in 
1878, that '• in Ladak and Thibet the natives in traveling make a small, 
smooth hole in the ground, which tliey fill with tobacco, and then make 
a connecting hole through which they draw the smoke directly into the 
mouth, thus making the ground perform the parts of a bowl." 

Mr. Clarence B. Moore has illustrate'd from mounds on the Georgia 
coast two or three other pii)es, both of pottery and of stone, which pre- 
sent uni({ue features impossible to classify with any type.^ 

There are in the U. S. National Museum a number of walrus ivorj^ 
I)ipes which are commonly bored lengthwise of the tusk, one-half from 
each end. The opening in the larger end is subsequently plugged with 
a i)iece of ivory and colored black to conceal where the plug is inserted. 
At times the smaller end is shaped to form a mouthpiece; at other 
times an opening is left for the insertion of a mouthpiece comj^osed of 
wood, bone, ivory, or even of metal, instances occurring of copper car- 
tridges being so employed. The bowls of the character of those of figs. 
188 to 192, inclusive, which appear to be of Japanese type, are held in 
position by gluing, mortising, with dowels, or, as is often the case, 
bound on with green seal skin thongs and allowed to dry. The bowls 
are variously of stone, bone, ivory, or metal. The etching on these 
pipes is often quite elaborate, representing scenes from Arctic daily 
life, both ludicrous and serious. There is a specimen of this type 
which has been bored by a succession of holes along the back all being 
subsequently cut into a single opening, which was subsequently closed 
with a tight plate as in fig. 189, though much longer. There is, how- 
ever, strong reason to suppose such pipes to be modern and intended 
rather for sale than for smoking. 

There is in the U. S. National Museum (Xo. 1210, loans catalogue) the 
cast of a steatite pipeintheform of a flying squirrel, collected by Mai, W.B. 
Camp, Sacket Harbor, Xew York, which is of unique character in that it 
is a straight tube, the exterior representing the scpiirrel with its extended 
wings in the act of sailing through the air. This pipe is described in the 
Proceedings of the Jefferson County Historical Society for 1895.

INTRODUCTION. 

The wall cases on the west side of the Mineral Hall contain a series 
of specimens, models, and labels illustrating and defining the several 
characters or properties of minerals. Accepting the definition of a 
mineral to be a definite chemical compound occurring in nature, which 
is usually capable of assuming a crystalline form when in the solid state, 
the subject-matter, consisting entirely of the labels used throughout 
the series, may from this definition be made to fall under two heads: 

I. Chemical mineralogy, which treats of those properties relating to 
chemical composition or atomic structure of a mineral, and tlie chemi- 
cal relations of the several kinds of minerals. 

II. Physical mineralogy, which treats of those properties relating to 
form or molecular structure of a mineral, and the action of the various 
physical forces upon the several kinds of minerals.

I. CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. 
THE ELEMENTS. 

The chemist has made known the existence of a number of kinds of 
matter which can not be resolved into more simple forms. These kinds 
of matter, of which there are about seventy at present known, are by 
agreement called elements. The elements unite with and often replace 
one another in certain constant proportions by weight. These weights 
are expressed by numbers variously designated as equivalent, propor- 
tional, reacting, and combining weights and as atomic weights. The 
elements with their symbols and atomic weights are :

Berzelins, in bis electro-chemical hypothesis, distinguished certain 
relations between the different elements by the terms electro-negative 
and electro-positive. Later, the terms acidic and basic came into use. 
As synonymous with these, the terms negative and positive are now 
used, although they, like the others, are not free from objections. 

From the combinations of the elements, the more negative uniting 
with the more positive in varying proportions and in groups of two, 
three, or more, all known compounds are produced. These unions take 
place in accordance with certain general chemical laws, the observation 
of which has given rise to the hj^pothesis that the elementary bodies 
are made up of indivisible particles, called atoms, and that chemical 
combination takes place through the union of these atoms. A group 
of atoms thus united is called a molecule. 

All minerals are composed of either an element alone or two or more 
elements in combination. Elements are said to combine when, on 
bringing them together, a new substance is produced, diftering from 
and possessing properties which, as a rule, are not the mean of those 
of its constituents. For example, the gases hydrogen and oxygen 
under the proper conditions combine to form water, a liquid. These 
combinations are represented symbolically by the juxtaposition of the 
symbols of the component elements. Thus, a molecule of water, com- 
posed of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen, is rei^resented by 
the symbol YliO. The multiplication of a group of atoms is denoted by 
placing the proper numeral to the left of a group of symbols, or by 
inclosing them in parentheses and placing a small numeral to the right. 
Thus, 3H2O or (HaO)^ denotes three molecules of water. The combina- 
tion of groups is expressed by placing their symbols in juxtaposition 
with a i)eriod between them. Thus, Fe>03.El20 denotes a compound of 



652 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

oxygen and iron containing water. Sometimes the comma or the sign + 
is used in i^lace of the period. Further, the letter R is used to denote 
a varying group of equivalent elements. Thus, It Cb20 ; is a compound 
in which there is a varying amount of the equivalent elements of the 
rare earths. R is also used as a general symbol for anj' element. These 
general principles are illustrated by the following series of labels and 
specimens showing the combinations of some typical elements: 

Zinc and its covtbinations. — Zinc combines with sulphur to form the 
comi)ouuds sphalerite, and wurtzite. Combined with oxygen it forms 
the compound ziucite; with oxygen and other elements it forms a num- 
ber of combinations. These oxygen compounds may be either oxida- 
tion products of zinc compounds alone, such as goslarite, ZnSOi.THiO; 
adamite, Zn2(OH)As04; and smithsonite, ZnCO;,; or of zinc compounds 
in which there is some other base, as in kottigite (Zn,Co);iAs20H.8H20, 
and aurichalcite (Zu,Cu)5(OH),j(C03)2. Zinc combines with silicon and 
oxygen to form two well-defined compounds, willemite, Zn2Si04, and 
calamine, H2Zn2Si04.

Tin and its combinations. — Tin occurs in combination with sulphur 
along with copper and iron in stannite, and with oxygen in cassiterite. 
These compounds, together with a few minerals in which the stannic; 
comjiounds have been occluded and are present only as an impurity, 
are the only known occurrences of this element. 

Examples. 

Stannite— Cu.FeSnS^— St. Just, Cornwall, England. (Cat. No. 47028, U.S.N.M.) 
Cassiterite — SnO.. — Grauien, Bohemia. (Cat. No. 4.5607, U.S.N.M.) 

Lead and its combinations. — Lead unites with sulphur alone to form 
galena, and with sulphur and arsenic or antimony to form a number of 
compounds, of which dufrenoysite, Pb2As2S.-,, and zinkenite, PbSbaSj, 
are examples. Combined with selenium or tellurium it is found iu 
clausthalite, PbSe, and altaite, PbTe. It forms a number of combina- 
tions with oxygen. These oxygen compounds may be simple oxidation 
products of lead alone, such as massicot, PbOj i)lattnerite, Pb02, and

miuiiim, rb304; or of lead compounds, such as auglesite, PbSO^; 
melanotekite, Pb^FeoSi^O,,, and cerussite, PbCOs. With chlorine it 
forms cotunuite, PbCl.; with chlorine and oxygen or oxygen salts it 
forms oxychlorides and other salts of a mixed composition, such as

metallic elements, forming a class of compounds of which realgar, 
AsS; stibnite, Sb^S;!; molybdeuite, M0S2; sphalerite, ZnS, and chalco- 
pyrite, CuFeSi, are examples. Combined with the more positive 
metallic elements, and with arsenic, antimony, or bismuth, it forms a 
series of compounds such as cobaltite, CoAsS; arseuoi)yrite, Fe(As,S)..; 
proustite, Ag:,AsS:,, and tetrahedrite, CugSbiS;. Finally, its combina- 
tion.' with the several elements unite more or less readily with oxygen, 
forming a number of oxidized species, such as barite, BaSOjj seleuite, 
CaS04.2H.,0, and brochantite, Cu,(OH)6S04.

Copper and its combinations. — Copper is rather abuudautly distributed 
ill a variety of forms. Combined with sulphur, either alone or with 
the sulpliur compounds of other elements, it forms a variety of combi- 
nations, of which chalcocite, Cu^S, and chalcoj)yrite, CuFeS2, are exam- 
ples. With arsenic and antimony, alone or with other elements, it 
forms compounds such as doineykite, Cu^As, horsfordite, CugSb, and 
tetrahedrite, CuiSbjS:. It forms a number of compounds with oxy- 
gen. These oxygen compounds may be simple oxidation products of 
copper, like cuprite, Cu^O; or of copper compounds, such as atacamite, 
Cu,0:,H,Cl; malachite, Cu2(OH)2C03; chrysocolla, H,CuSi04.n205 libe-

Silver and its combinations. — Silver, alone or with other elements, 
combines with sulphur, selenium, tellurium, arsenic, and antimony to 
form compounds, of which the following are examples : Argeutite, AgaS, 
naumannite, Ag.Se; hessite, AgjTe; huntilite, Ag:,As; dyscrasite,Ag:iSb; 
proustite, AguAsS;,, and pyrargyrite, AgsSbS.-,, United with chlorine, 
bromine, or iodine it forms the minerals cerargyrite, AgCl; bromyrite, 
AgBr, and iodyrite, Agl. It does not unite witli oxygen, and hence 
forms no oxygen compounds.

Gold and its combinations. — Gold is, with a few exceptions, found only 
in tlie native state, sometimes pure, but more often alloyed with silver 
or intimately mixed with other metallic elements or their compounds. 
In nature it combines with but one negative element, tellurium, forming 
the compounds sylvauite, (Au,Ag)Te2 5 n^igyagite, AuaPbi4Sb3(S,Te)24, 
and petzite, (Au,Ag)Te. 

Examples. 

Sylvanite— (Au,Ag)Te,— P.oukler County, Colorado. (Cat. No. 81145, U.S.N.M.)

TYPES OF MINERALS. 

Tiie combinations of the several elements, together with such elements 
as may occur free, fall naturally in two classes — elements and comjiounds. 

By a compound is meant that body produced by the combination of 
two or more elements, and which is different in its nature from, and 
whose properties as a rule are not the mean of, those of its constituents. 
A compound is to be distinguished from a mixture, or simple mechan- 
ical aggregation, in that it always implies a chemical union of its com- 
ponents, and therefore possesses a definite chemical composition. 

Among minerals these two classes may be further divided in accord- 



THE PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. 657 

ancewith chemical laws and grouped under certain ])r()inin(Mit types as 
follows : 

Native elements. — Of the seventy or more elements at present known 
to chemistry, but eighteen, excluding those occurring only in the 
gaseous state, are found native; carbon, sulphur, the metals of the 
platitium group, mercury, copper, silver, and gold are among these. 
With the native elements are included the native alloys or compounds 
and mixtures of elements belonging to the same groups in the periodic 
system. 

The type is represented by the following specimens: 

Graphite— Ceylou. (Cat. No. 81365, U.S.N.M.) 
Sulphur— Cianciana, Sicily. (Cat. No. 51951, U.S.N.M.) 

Selensulphur — White Islands, Bay of Plenty, New Zealand. (Cat. No. 48050, 
U.S.N.M.)

Silver— Freiberg, Saxony. (Cat. No. 49478, U.S.N.M.) 
Gold— California. (Cat. No. 81429, U.S.N.M.) 

Fluorides, chlorides, bromides, and iodides. — The halogens, fluorine, 
chlorine, bromine, and iodine, form simple and complex compounds 
with other elements. The halides, as these compounds are called, are 
divided cliemically into four classes — fluorides, chlorides, bromides, and 
iodides — according to the nature of the negative constituent. Two 
of the halogens — fluorine and chlorine — enter into the composition 
of several oxidized species, called, respectively, oxyfluorides and oxy- 
cldorides — compounds in which there is a metallic Huoride or chloride 
with a basic oxide of the same metal. 

The following specimens are representatives of these types : 

Fluorite— England. (Cat. No. 49603, U.S.N.M.) 

Cryolite— Erigtok, Arksut-fiord, Greenland. (Cat. No. 46271, U.S.N.M.)

Sulphides, selenides, and tellurides. — The elements sulphur, selenium, 
and tellurium bear a marked resemblance to each other, and present 
close analogies in their properties, occurrence, and mode of combining 
with other elements. The terms suli)hi(le, selenide, and telluride 
include all those com])Ounds in which sulphur, selenium, or telliiriuni

forms tbe negative part. These throe elements combine in this manner 
with most of the metals. Further, the three negative elements are 
essentially isomorphous, and may replace each other in varying amounts. 
These types are illustrated by the following specimens: 

Orpiincnt — Simshiiie mino, Sunshiue, Utah. (Cat. No. 84027, U.S.N. M.) 
Molybdenite— Hallein, Austria. (Cat. No. 49904, U.S.N. M.)

Sylvanite— Oftenbanya, Hungary. (Cat. No. 9719, U.S.N.M.) 

Arsenides antimonides, and Msmuthides. — Arsenic, antimony, and bis- 
muth are analogous in their jjroperties, and unite with other elements to 
form arsenides, antimonides, andbismuthides. Arsenic and antimony, 
and, to a certain extent, bismuth, are essentially isomorphous, and may 
replace one another in varying amounts. With the arsenides, antimo- 
nides, and bismuthides are included the sulpharsenides, sulphantin)o- 
nides, and sulphbismnthides — compounds in which the negative part is 
taken by arsenic, antimony, or bismuth with sulphur. 

The following specimens are illustrative of these types: 

NiccolitL' — Gem mine. Silver Clitf, Colorado. (Cat. No. 51465, U.S.N.M.) 
L()llingite — Horace Porter mine, Gunnison County, Colorado. (Cat. No. 51566,

Cobaltite— Coquimbo, Chile. (Cat. No. 13372, U.S.N.M.) 
Arsenopyrite — Rockbridge County, Virginia. (Cat. No, 13982, U,S.N.M.) 

Sulphnnalts. — This class includes the various native salts of the sul- 
phoacids of arsenic, antimony, bismuth, tin, and germanium. The ele- 
ments })resent as bases are chiefly lead, copper, and silver; less often 
iron, mercury, zinc, etc. The several compounds are arranged with 
reference to their negative parts as follows : Sulpharsenites, suliihan- 
timonites, and sulphbismuthites; sulpharsenates, sulphantimonates, 
sulphstannates, and sulphgermanates. 

Examples of these are shown in the specimens of — 

Chalcostibite— St. Gertraad, Carinthia, Austria. (Cat. No. 84088, U.S.N.M. ) 
Freieslebenite — Garfield mine, Gunnison Count j-, Colorado. (Cat. No. 82622,

Oxi/Kulphides. — The minerals here included are those sulphides in 
which the sulphur is in ])art replaced by oxygen — that is, (•,omi)ounds 
of sulphides and oxides. 

The type is illustrated by — 

Kermesite— South Ham, Quebec, Canada. (Cat. No. 16870, U.S.N.M.) 
Oxides and oxyijen salts. — From the abundance of oxygen and its 
nearly universal affinities, its combinations form by far the largest num- 
ber of the compounds of the elements. The minerals of this class fall 
into two general groups — the oxides of the elements and their combina- 
tions. To the tirst group the general name oxides is given; to the 
second, oxygen salts. The oxygen salts include a number of types of 
minerals, such as carbonate, silicate, and phosphate. 
The tyi)e oxide is represented by the following specimens: 

Cervantite — Fords Creek, near Gulzora, New South Wales. (Cat. No. 82476, 
U.S.N.M.) 
Zincite — Franklin, Sussex County, New .Jersey. (Cat. No. 50230, U.S.N.M.)

Ilydrotalcitc— Snarum, Norway. (Cat. No. 49026, U.S.N.M.) 

Oxygen salts, borates, aluminates, chromites, ferrites, and manganites. — 
Borontrioxide, BaOj, under the proper conditions, will combine with 
other oxides to form borates. Alumina, ALO,, acts with oxides of 
stronger bases as an acid-forming oxide, and unites with them to form 
aluminates. Chromic oxide, Cr20:i, and ferric oxide, Fe203, unite with 
oxides of stronger bases to form chromites and ferrites. Oxide of man- 
ganese, Mn.O:), acts as an acid-forming oxide toward stronger bases, 
and forms with them manganates. 

The following sj)ecimens are illustrative of these types: 

Ulexite— Columbus, Nevada. (Cat. No. 14379, U.S.N.M.)

6 GO REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

Oxyfien salts, carhonatrs. — The carbonates — eoinpoiiiuls of carbon diox- 
ide with other oxides — form a numerous and important class of minerals. 
They may be conveniently arrani^ed as follows: Normal carbonates, 
compounds in which the ratio of oxygen in the carbon dioxide to the 
oxygen in the combined oxide is as 2:1; basic carbonates, compounds 
in which the ratio of the number of the oxygen atoms to that of the 
combined oxide is less than 2:1; fluo and chloro carbonates, compounds 
in which there is a fluoride or chloride with a carbonate of the same 
element. 

The following specimens are of this type: 

C'alcite— Waldshut, Germany. (Cat. No. 2016, U.S.N. M.) 

Smitbsonitc— Joplin, Missouri. (Cat. No. 48638, U.S.N. M.) 

Malachite— Nizne-Tagilsk, Siberia. (Cat. No. 49401, U.S.N. M.) 

Azurite — Copper Queen mine, Bisbee, Arizona. (Cat. No. 48769, U.S.N.M.) 

Phosgenite— Monte Toni, Sardinia. (Cat. No. 51948, U.S.N.M.) 

Oxygen salts, silicates. — The silicates — compounds of silicon oxides 
with other oxides — constitute about nine-tenths of the known crust of 
the earth and more than one-fourth of the known kinds of minerals. 
Isomorphic combinations are the rule, and as a class they exliibit 
great diversity of composition. For example, the ratio of oxygen in silica 
to that in combined oxide may vary for monad and dyad elements, such 
as potassium or calcium, between 2 : 4 and 4:1; and for silicates of triad 
elements, such as aluminum or iron, between 2:6 and 12:3. Again, it 
is not unusual to find a silicate containing both potassium and calcium 
as oxides combined with silica, or the oxides of iron and aluminum, 
or of calcium and aluminum, and that not necessarily in atomic pro- 
portion. But, although certain oxides are capable of mutual replace- 
ment in any and all proportions, such as the sesquioxides of iron, 
aluminum, etc., or the monoxides of calcium, magnesium, iron, man- 
ganese, sodium, lithium, etc., and though a silicate may contain at 
once a mixture of sesquioxides and monoxides in combination with 
silica, the place of a monoxide is not taken by a sesquioxide nor that 
of a sesquioxide by a monoxide.

THE PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. 661 

Oxyf/en salts, titanates. — The titanates — coinpounds of oxides witli 
oxides whose negative portion is made up solely or chiefly of titanium 
oxide — may be arranged under the following' groups: Titanates, com- 
pounds Avhose negative portion is titanium oxide; titanosilicates, 
compounds whose negative portion is compounded of titanic and silicic 
oxides; columbotitanates, including those compounds intermediate 
between the titanates and the succeeding- columbates, and whose nega- 
tive parts may consist of the oxide of titanium with the oxides of 
columbium or silicon, with zirconium, etc. 

Examples. 

Iluienite — Chester County, Pennsylvania. (Cat. No. 49959, U.S.N.M.) 
Titauite— Renfrew County, Canada. (Cat. No. 46566, U.S.N.M.) 
Hydrotitanit( — Magnet Cove, Arkansas. (Cat. No. 45259, U.S.N.M.) 

Oxygen salts, eoJnmhates and tantalatcs. — The coluinbates and tanta- 
lates include those compounds of oxides with oxides whose negative 
parts are taken by the oxides of columbium or tantalum. The intimate 
relations existing between these compounds require them to be grouped 
together, there being, in fact, but few native tantalates that do not 
contain more or less columbium. 

Examples. 

Columbite— Peru, Maine. (Cat. No. 46854, U.S.N.M.) 

Samarskite — Wiseman mine, Mitchell County, North Carolina. (Cat. No. 51222, 
U.S.N.M.) 
Tautalite — Coosa County, Alabama. (Cat. No. 45846, U.S.N.M.) 

Oxygen salts,nitat€s. — The nitrates — compounds of oxides with oxides 
whose negative portion is nitrogen pentoxide — are few and are chiefly 
salts of sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. There is a single 
hydrous basic cuprous species and a few double salts. 

Examples. 

Sodaniter— Chile. (Cat. No. 8322s U.S.N.M.; 

O.rygen salts, vanadates. — Under this head are included those min- 
erals in which vanadium pentoxide constitutes the negative portion. 
The principal vanadates are vanadinite, a combination of a lead vana- 
date with a chloride of the same metal, and descloizite, a basic lead 
vanadate carrying zinc. 

Examples. 

Vanadinite — Aqiui Fria mine, Yavapai County, Arizona. (Cat. No. 48711 
U.S.N.M.) 

Ucscloizite — Commercial mine, Georgetown, New Mexico. (Cat. No. 48458 
U.S.N.M.) 

Oxygen salts, phosphates. — Under this head are included the native 
oxydized compounds of phosphorus, which are without exception com- 
pounds of oxides with phosphorus pentoxide. The majorit}' of these 
compounds are either isomorphous modifications or basic salts, both

anbydrons aud hydrous. The phosphates may crystallize with a fluor- 
ide as ill apatite, with a chloride as in pyromorphite, or with a hydroxyl 
as in triploidite. 
The following are examples of this type : 

Monazite — Burke County, North Carolina. (Cat. No. 49463, U.S.N.M.) 
Apatite— Hammond, St. Lawronce County, New York. (Cat. No. 49780, U.S.N.M.) 
Pyromorphite — Wheatley mine, Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. (Cat. No. 12572, 

U.S.N.M.) 
Triploidite — Branchville, Connecticut. (Cat. No. 49576, U.S.N.M.) 
Variscite— Montgomery County, Arkansas. (Cat. No. 45194, U.S.N.M.) 
Cacoxenite — Nobles mine, Lancaster Couuty, Pennsylvania. (Cat. No. 49075, 

U.S.N.M.) 
Autunite — Stoneham, Maine. (Cat. No. 45795, U.S.N.M.) 

Oxygen salts, arsenates. — The arsenates include all those compounds of 
oxides with oxides whose negative parts are taken by arsenic pentox- 
ide. The arsenates are similar to the phosphates in molecular structure, 
and, like them, the majority are either isomorphic modifications or basic 
salts, both with and without water of crystallization. Further, they may 
consist of a combination of a chloride, fluoride, or hydroxyl with an 
arsenate. As a class they present many analogies to the phosphates, 
and like salts, as a rule, are isomorplious. The few rare native antimo- 
nates, together with chloriferous antimonites and arsenites, are here 
included with the arsenates. 

Examples of this type are shown in the following specimens: 

Mimetite— Leadville, Colorado. (Cat. No. 51362, U.S.N.M.) 
Tyrolitc— Mammoth min<', Tintic, Utah. (Cat. No. 48121, U.S.N.M.) 
Conichalcite — American Eagle mine, Tintic, Utah. (Cat. No. 48244, IT.S.N.M.) 
Sforodite— Red Mountain, Colorado. (Cat. No. 81190, U.S.N.M. ) 

Oxygen salts, sulphates. — The sulphates — compounds of oxides with 
oxides in which the sole or principal negative constituent is sulphur 
trioxide — may be simple or isomorphic combinations or basic salts, 
either anhydrous or hydrous. They may also crystallize with chlorides 
or carbonates. The few native tellurates and selenates, compounds 
analogous to the sulphates, whose negative parts are respectively taken 
by telluric or selenic oxide, together with those compounds in which 
the more negative part is taken by either tellurous or selenous oxide, 
are here grouped with the sulphates. 

The following specimens are examples of this type: 

Barite— DufUm, England. (Cat. No. 49799, U.S.N.M.) 
Selenite— I'ort Ellsworth, Kansas. (Cat. No. 82376, U.S.N.M.)

Alnnogeu — Esmeralda County, Nevada. (Cat. No. 17643, U.S.N.M.) 
Hanksite— San Bernardino County, California. (Cat. No. 81217, U.S.N.M.) 

Oxygen salts, chronuites. — The chromates — compounds of chromium 
trioxide with other oxides — are isomorphous with the corresponding 
sulphates. The class has but few representatives among minerals.

Oxygen salts, molyhdates and tungstates. — The molybdates and tung- 
state.s — conipouuds of oxides with oxides \yhose negative parts are 
taken by molybdenum or tungsten trioxide — are few, there being, in 
fact, about a~ dozen kinds only of minerals of this class.

O.rygen salts, uranates. — The uranates — compounds of the oxides of 
uranium with other oxides — are very comi^lex in composition. They 
contain, in addition to the oxides of uranium, the oxides of thorium, 
zirconium, yttrium, and the cerium metals. Certain of the uranates 
also contain nitrogen, argon, and helium in an unknown state of com- 
bination. 

The type is represented by : 

Urauiuite — Wood mine, Central, Colorado. (Cat. No. 83759, U.S.N.M.) 

Compounds of organic origin. — This class includes the native salts of 
organic acids such as the oxalates and mellates, the oxygenated 
hydrocarbons, as the anibers and various fossil resins, together with 
the numerous carbon comi)ounds like the petroleums, asphaltums, and 
mineral coals, which are, in general, simply mixtures.

VARIATIONS IN COMPOSITION. 

A mineral is primarily a body having a certain and definite chemi- 
cal composition. This ideal condition is not always present, and the 
composition of any one species may vary within wide limits. This 
variation in composition may be due to: Original mixtures — that is, 
\\hen tv<'o or more minerals are so intimately mixed that the mass 
appears uniform ; metasoniatosis, in which a mineral originally 
homogeneous may be partially altered by a process of "indefinite sub- 
stitution and replacement;" chemical substitution, in which there has 
been a complete or partial substitution of one or more elements for 



664 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

auother. The specimen of emery (Oat. No. 18117, U.S.N.M.) is a mix- 
ture in variable proportions of corundum, oxide of aluminum, with 
magnetite, oxide of iron. The next specimen (Cat. No. 35943, U.S.N.M.), I 

known as red felsite, is a feldspar mixed with quartz and other miner- 
als and is the result of a melting- together of the original minerals. 
The next (Cat. No. 49085, U.S.N.M.) is an intimate mixture of zircon, 
thorite, and limonite. 

The specimens of pyrite altering to limonite (Cat. No. 13577, U.S.N.M.), 
of corundum to dauiourite (Cat. No. 49G11, U.S.N.M.), of almandite to 
chlorite (Cat. No. 8121G, U.S.N.M.), of iolite to chlorophyllite (Cat. No. • 
82456, U.S.N.M.), and of pyroxene to serpentine (Cat. No. 39327, 
U.S.N.M.) show some of the variations resulting from metasomatosis. 
The important instances of variable composition due to chemical sub- 
stitution are illustrated by several series of minerals, among which 
may be noted the amphiboles, tremolite, CaMg3(Si03)4; actinolite, 
Ca(Mg,Fe)3(Si03)4; cummingtouite (Fe,Mg)Si03, and griinerite, FeSiOs, 
in which the calcium and magnesium are gradually replaced by iron. 

RELATION OF WATER TO COMPOSITION. 

Water is an important constituent of many minerals, and is contained 
in them in a variety of forms. It may exist as water of crystallization, 
that is, simply as water; or as water of constitutiou, that is, as hydro- 
gen and oxygen in the relative proportions to form water, though prob- 
ably not actually existing as such. In the first instance the water is 
readily expelled from the mineral on heating; and the proportion of 
water so occurring is fixed, each molecule of the anhydrous substance 
being combined with some definite number of molecules of water. In 
the second case the mineral usually yields water only at a high tem- 
l)erature or on continued heating, and the water so occurring probably 
does not exist as such, but rather as its elements; the compound is 
broken up by heat with the liberation of basic hydrogen which com- 
bines with oxygen to form water. Finally water may combine with the 
same anhydrous substance in several different proportions to form as 
many dilferent compounds. These relations are illustrated by the next 
series of twenty-four specimens. 

RELATION OF WATER TO PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. 

Water, when combined as such in definite equivalent proportions, 
may vary in amount according to the physical conditions under which 
the compound separates from solution. The water thus contained 
often has a great influence on the physical properties of the substance. 
Thus borax at ordinary temperatures separates from solution with 
four and a half parts of water and crystallizes in oblique rhombic 
prisms; at 80° it separates with two parts of water and crystallizes in 
octahedrons. In some cases the water is so feebly combined that it 
gradually separates when the comi)Ound is exposed to dry air, the sub- 



THE PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. 665 

stance at the same time losing its crystalline form and falling- to 
powder; in other cases the compound may absorb water from moist 
air to such an extent as to form a solution. These conditions are 
respectively known as efflorescence and deliquescence. Further, the 
jn^eseuce of water combined with a salt often influences its color; and 
finally, those minerals containing water are, as a rule, lighter and 
softer than anhydrous minerals of an otherwise similar composition. 

These effects are illustrated by a series of pairs of minerals and 
laboratory compounds, each pair consisting of aualagous hydrous and 
anhydrous compounds, the differences in each case being stated on the 
accompanying label. 

RELATION OF COMPOSITION TO PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. 

The comparison of almost any mineral with the elements of which it 
is composed shows that its more fundamental properties, such as specific 
gravity, luster, etc., are, to a limited extent, the average of those of its 
constituent elements. Three series of specimens illustrative of this are 
shown. 

I. Density series : This series illustrates the relations between the 
specific gravity of minerals and their composition. Those minerals in 
which the heavy elements predominate are themselves heavy ; and those 
composed chiefly of the lighter elements have a correspondingly low 
specific gravity. 

JI. Magnetism series: Those minerals which are magnetic are rich 
in the magnetic elements, and their magnetic properties increase with 
the increase of their magnetic constituents. 

III. Luster series: Those minerals in which elements having a metal- 
lic luster i^redomiuate usually possess a metallic luster; and those com- 
posed chiefly of the nonmetallic elements have a nonmetallic luster. 

These relations are illustrated by the following series of minerals:

II. PHYSICAL MINERALOGY. 
A — PROPERTIES RELATING TO FORM OR MOLECULAR STRUCTURE. 

THE CRYSTAL. 

Substances which are chemically homogeneous, when they solidify 
from a state of vapor, solution, or fusion, tend to assume certain regu- 
lar forms as a result of mathematical symmetry in the action of cohe- 
sive attraction. The forms jjroduced are regularly bounded solids, 
called crystals. Crystals are bounded by plane surfaces, called i)lanes 
or faces, symmetrically arranged with reference to and whose position 
in a given crystal is related in some simple ratio to the relative lengths 
of one or more diametral lines called axes. The angles of a crystal 
are of tWo kinds, interfacial and solid. The interfacial angle is that 
formed by the intersection of two crystal planes, and the line of such 
an intersection is called an edge. The solid angle is that formed by 
the intersection of three or more crystal faces. The angles or edges of 
a crystal are often replaced by one or more planes. When an edge is 
replaced by a single plane it is said to be truncated; a replacement by 
two similar planes is a bevelment. Further, the corresi)ouding angles 



THE PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. 667 

between tlie faces of diftereiit crystals of the same substance are 
essentially constant. These features of a crj^stal are illustrated by a 
series of specimens and models. 

CRYSTALLOGRAPIIIC AXES. 

The crystallographic axes are imaginary straight lines passing 
thi'ough the center of a crystal. They are assumed as axes in order to 
describe by reference to them the relative positions of the different 
planes. One of the axes is called the vertical, the other two or three 
the lateral. They may be of equal or unequal lengths, and may inter- 
sect at either right or oblique angles. The relative positions and incli- 
nations of the planes of crystals are expressed by referring them to sys- 
tems of axes. They are : 

Isometric. — Three equal and interchangeable axes (a) which intersect 
at angles of 90 degrees. 

Teirafional. — Two equal and interchangeable lateral axes {a) at 90 
degrees to each other, and one unequal and dissimilar vertical axis (c) 
at right angles to them. 

Hexagonal. — Three equal and interchangeable lateral axes [a) inter- 
secting each other at angles of CO degrees. One unecjual and dissimilar 
axis, a vertical (c), at 90 degrees to the others. 

Orthorhomhic. — Three unequal and not interchangeable axes at 90 
degrees to each other. Any one of the three directions may be made 
the vertical axis (c). Conventionally the longer lateral axis (6) is 
placed horizontally from right to left and is called the macrodiagonal; 
while the shorter lateral axis {a), which runs from back to front, is 
called the brachydiagonal. 

MonocUnie. — Three unequal and not interchangeable axes, two of 
which {a and c) lie at an angle /i to each other. The third axis {b) is 
at 90 degrees to both a and c. Conventionally, e is placed verticallj^, b 
horizontally from right to left, and is called the orthodiagonal, while a, 
the oblique axis, is called the clinodiagonal. 

TricUnic. — Three unequal and not interchangeable axes at oblique 
angles, a, /i, ;/, to each other. Anyone of the three directions may be 
taken as the vertical (c). The longer of the two remaining axes, the 
macrodiagonal (h), inclines downward toward the right, and the 
shorter, the brachydiagonal {a), downward toward the front. 

CRYSTAL FORM. 

The term "crystal form" is defined as: The sum of all possible planes 
bounding a crystal which are geometrically and physically equal. 
Crystal forms are of three tyjies: Pinacpids, composed of planes par- 
allel to two axes. Prisms and domes, forms whose planes intersect 
two axes and are parallel to a third. Pyramids, forms whose planes 
cut all three axes. 

Crystal forms may be simi)le or in combination. Simple forms are 



668 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

those which contain similiir j^lanes only. Combinations are those in 
which dissimilar planes occnr, and are made up of those simple forms 
which would result from the extension of one set of similar planes till 
tlie others disappear. In certain compounds only complete forms occur ; 
in others crystal faces occur wliich correspond in position to jjlanes of 
comjdete forms, but there has been a regular suppression of one-half to 
three-(iuarters of the required number of planes. These conditions are 
known respectively as holohodral, hemiliedral, and tetartohedral accord- 
ing as there is the full, one-half, or one-quarter of the required number 
of planes present. 

The number of possible combinations of crystal forms is large; but 
they may all be grouped under six .systems. 

CRYSTAL SYSTEMS. 

''A system is the sum of all the possible crystal forms whose planes 
can be referred to the same kinds of axes." The systems of crystalliza- 
tion are: (1) Isometric; (2) tetragonal; (3) hexagonal; (4) ortho- 
rhombic; (5) monocliuic; (6) triclinic. The first system includes 
all forms referable to three axes of equal length which intersect at 
angles of 90 degrees. The second and third systems include all forms 
referable to one ])rincipal or vertical axis which is perpendicular to 
and different in length from the lateral axes. The fourth, fifth, and 
sixth include those forms having no principal axis. 

Isometric system. — Includes all forms referable to three axes of equal 
length, and which intersect at angles of 9w degrees.

SYMMETRY. 

A crystal shows symmetry when it can be revolved about an axis an 
even multiple of 360 degrees without its position as a whole in space 
being changed, or can be cut in halves which are to each other as their 



THE PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. ()71 

mirror reflections. All faces of a crystal are symmetrical about a 
point, and in some crystals are grouped in accordance with certain 
definite planes of symmetry ; that is, a plane which is capable of dividing 
the crystal in halves, whose internal and external foi'nis are to each 
other as a reflection, and also with axes of symmetry. Axes of sym- 
metry may be defined as lines passing through the center of a crystal 
about which it can be revolved through an angle of <;0 degrees (hex- 
agonal axis), J)0 degrees (tetragonal axis), 1-0 degrees (trigonal axis), 
or 180 degrees (digonal axis), without its i)osition as a whole in space 
being changed. All crystals maybe grouped under seven systems in 
thirty-two types in accordance with their symmetry, as follows : 

Isometric .sij.stem. — Types: Holohedral, tetrahedral-hemihedral, 
pentagonal -hemihedral, plagiohedral-hemihedral, and tetartohedral. 
The most general form possesses nine planes of symmetry, of which 
three (S planes) are at right angles to one another, and six ( 2i' planes) 
which bisect the angles formed by the S planes. There are thirteen 
axes of symmetry, of which three are tetragonal ( □ ) and are per- 
pendicular to the S planes and parallel to the intersection of two 
S and two ^ planes; four are trigonal (A) and are parallel to 
the intersections of three 2 planes; six are digonal (O) and are 
l)erpendicular to the 2 planes and parallel to the intersection of an 
S and 2:' plane. 

The types are illustrated by nu)dels which may be described as 
fi)llows :

six (S planes) intersect each other at angles of GO degrees, and one 
(C plane) which is at right angles to these. 

There are seven axes of symmetry, of which one, the hexagonal (O) 
is perpendicular to the C plane and parallel to the intersections of the 
S planes; six are digonal (O) and lie in the C plane at right angles to 
the S i^lanes.

COMrOUND CKYSTALS. 

Compound crystals are divided into two classes, according as the 
several individuals are in reversed or parallel positions with reference 
to each other; that is, into twin crystals and parallel growths. 

Twin crystals are those in which one or more i^arts, regularly ar- 
ranged, are in a reversed relation to the other part or ])arts. A twin 
crystal may be conceived of as two individuals, or parts of the same 
individual placed in a parallel position, and then a half revolution to

take place about a certain axis wliicli will bring tlieni into a reversed 
or twinning position. 

Twin crystals are classed as contact twins and penetration twins. 

Parallel growths are those in which the molecular arrangement is 
completely parallel in the component individuals; that is, the corre- 
sponding planes are i^arallel throughout all the individuals, and they 
are only separated from each other by their external planes. 

The following are illustrations of the methods of twinning and of 
parallel growths:

IMPEUFECTIONS OK CRYSTALS. 

A crystal is theoretically a symmetrical polyhedron having its 
homologous faces, angles, and dimensions in the direction of like axes 
equal. This ideal condition is rarely attained by the crystal; the form 
may be distorted, the planes may be irregular, or the crystal may 
contain internal impurities. 

The crystal, then, may fall short of perfection by distortion of form, 
imperfection of crystal planes, internal impurities.

rLEOMORI'HISM. 

Pleoniorpliism is that tendency of some chemical compounds to 
crystallize in two or more distinct forms. Specimens of the following- 
compounds illustrate this tendency: 

Calcium carbonate, CaCOs, crystallizes in thc^ rhombobedral system as calcite, in 
the orthorhombic system as aragonite. 

Titaniimi dioxide, TiOj, cryst-allizes in the tetragonal system as rutile and octahe- 
drite, in the orthorhombic system as brookite. 

Iron bisulphide, FeS-, crystallizes in the isometric system as pyrite, in the ortho- 
rhombic system as marcasite. 

ISOMf)RPHISM. 

Isomorphism has been defined by Mitscherlich, its discoverer, as 
"substances which are analogous chemical compounds have the same, 
or nearly the same crystalline form." That is, two more distinct chemi- 
cal compounds may crystallize in like forms. Examples of this ten- 
dency are shown in — 

Spinel, MgALO^, Magnetite, FeFccO^, franklinite, (FeZnMn) (FeMn),04. Crystals 
isometric, commonly octahedral. 

Rutile, TiO.2, Cassiterite, SnOj. Crystals tetragonal, commonly prismatic. 

Apatite, (CaF)Ca4(PO^)3, pyromorphite, (PbCl)Pb^(PO,):, minietite, (PbCl)Pb4 
(P04):!, vanadinite, (PbC)Pbj(V04):i. Crystals hexagonal with pyramidal hemi- 
hedrism. 

Barite, BaS04. Celestite SrS04, anglesite, PbSO,. Crystals orthorhombic, com- 
monly tabular. 

PSEUDOMORPHS. 

Pseudomorph is that term applied to certain crystals or forms which 
have the angles and general habits of a certain mineral with the com- 
position and, in some instances, the structure of another; that is, the 



676 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

original substance has been changed to a new compound, or has disap- 
peared and been rephiced by another to which the habit of crystalliza- 
tion or structure jiresented does not belong. Pseudouiorplis are of 
three kinds: Substitution, deposition, and alteration. 

Pscudoniorphs by substitution coni})rise those cases in which there 
has been a more or less gradual replacement of the original nuxterial 
by another without chemical action taking place, and the form and 
structure of the original substance is preserved. 

J'Jxiniiplin. 

Quartz, SiO,., after linorite, CaFi, Cornwall, England (Cat. No. 82106, U.S.N.M.); 
cassiterite, SnO.., after orthoclase, KAlSi:(0«, Cornwall, England (Cat. No. 13431, 
U.S.N.M.); Copper, Cu, after aragouite, CaCOs, Corocoro, Bolivia (Cat. No. 10579, 

U.S.N.M.). 

Pseudomorphs by deposition fall under two heads: Incrustation, in 
which a layer or crust of a mineral deposited upon the surface of another 
substance assumes the form of that substance in a more or less perfect 
manner; infiltration, in which case a cavity or mold made by the 
removal of a substance has been filled by the dei)Osition of a mineral. 

Examjilcs. 

By incrustation: Qnartz, SiOj, a^ter calcite, CaCO, Schneeberg, Saxony (Cat. No. 
45tU0, U.8.N.M.) ; calcareous-tufa, CaCO:;, after leaves, organic, Bear Spring, IJcaver

82465, U.S.N.M.); silica, SiOi, after wood, organic, Greenwich, New Jersey (Cat. No. 
81879, U.S.N.M.). 

Pseudomorphs by alteration include those cases in which there has 
been a partial change of composition or structure and the secondary 
mineral retains some of the constituents of the first. This alteration 
may take i)lace. First, through paramorphism, or molecular rearrange- 
ment. Second, by the loss or assumption, or both, of an ingredient. 
Third, by a partial exchange of constituents.

CRYSTALLINE AGGREGATES. 

Many specimens of minerals occur in aggregates of imperfect crys- 
tals; aceordinglj^ the remaining kinds of structure may be brought to- 
gether under the head of crystalline aggregates. 

The individuals composing imperfectly crystalline masses may be: 
In columns or fibers, in which case the structure is columnar; in thin 
lamina-, plates, or leaves, giving rise to a lamellar structure; in grains, 
producing a granular structure. Further, there are numerous irregular 
and accidental groui)ings of the individuals composing the mass, giving 
to it certain shapes, such as globular, botryoidal, reniform, dendritic, 
etc., which are too numerous to allow of a specification here. These 
indeterminate forms are grouped under the head of "imitative shapes.^ 
Finally, the mass nuiy be entirely destitute of crystalline structure or 
imitative shape. Such a mass is called amorphous.

B — CHARACTERS RELATING TO COHESION AND ELASTICITY. 

CLEAVAGK. 

This is that tendency of a mineral to break in the direction of inini- 
niuni cohesion, and that direction is always parallel to some Diane 
which occnrs or may occur in the crystal. The cleavage is character- 
ize 1 first, according to direction that is, when parallel to certain faces 
or planes, as cubic, octahedral, dodecahedral, rhombohcdral, and also 
basic, prismatic, macrodiagonal, brachydiagoual, and so on; second, 
according to the ease with which it may be obtained, as perfect, imper- 
fect, interrupted, or difficult.

Difficult.— Qnartz, Brazil. (Cat. No. 44686, U.S.N.M.) 

GLIDINO, I'KESSURE, AND SEI'AKATION PLANES. 

When a crystal is subjected to pressure in certain directions a new 
series of ])lanes may be developed, as follows: Gliding planes, the sur- 
faces along which there has been a slipping accompanied by a rotation 
of the molecules. Pressure planes or percussion figures, the divisional 
planes diverging from a point of pressure which is applied at right 
angles to a natural face. Separation planes, false cleavages parallel to 
possible faces, and which result from the deposition of an impurity on 
these faces during the growth of the crystal. Examples of these are 
shown in the specimens of calcite, galena, mica, and quartz. 

I'KACTUKK. 

This is that surface obtained by breaking the mineral in a direction 
other than that of the cleavage. It may be designated as conchoidal, 
that is, breaking with concavities more or less deep; even, when the 
fracture ai)i)roxiniates a plane surface; uneven, when the surface is 
irregular; hackly or splintery, when the surface is jagged.

Examples of fracture. 

Conchoidal. — Xovaculite, Magnet Cove, Arkausas. (Cat. Xo. 46280, U.S.N.M.) 
£ren. — Chlorite, London County, Virginia. (Cat. No. 12352, U.S.N.M.)

Hackly. — Hematite, Dun Mountain, New Zealand. (Cat. No. 17792, U.S.N.M.) 

HARDNESS. 

This is the degree of resistauce a miueral ofters to abrasion. It is 
usuallj' referred to an arbitrary scale of ten minerals showing- a regular 
gradation iu hardness from l,talc, the softest; 12, gypsum; 3, caleite; 4, 
fluorite; 5, apatite; 6, orthoclase; 7, quartz; 8, topaz; 1), corundum, 
to 10, diamond, the hardest. 

TENACITY. 

The degrees of tenacity may be classed as brittle, sectile, malleable, 
flexible, and elastic. 
Examples of these are found in the following specimens: 

Caleite, Oxbow, Nevr York (Cat. No. 16883, U.S.N.M.), brittle; the mineral sepa- 
rates in grains or a powder ou attempting to cut it with a knife. 

Seleuite, Truckee Mountains, Nevada (Cat. No. 18374, U.S.N.M.), sectile; the 
mineral may be cut without falling to pieces, but pulverizes under the hammer. 

Copper, Copper Falls, Michigan (Cat. No. 12061, U.S.N.M.), malleable; slices may 
be cut oil' and llattened out under the hammer. 

Talc, Chester County, Pennsylvania (Cat. No. 12002, U.S.N.M.), flexible; the min- 
eral will bend, but remains bent after the bending force is removed. 

Muscovite, Peunsbury, Pennsylvania (Cat. No. 83483, U.S.N.M.), elastic; the min- 
eral after bending will spring b.ack to its original position. 

C — CHARACTERS DEPENDING UPON MASS OR VOLUME. 

SPECIFIC GRAVITY. 

This is the density of the mineral compared with that of distilled 
water at 4° C. The wide range in the specific gravity of minerals is 
sho\^n by a series of specimens, and their relative densities shown by 
cubes, taking a definite volume of water as unity. 

D — PROPERTIES RELATIN(r TO HEAT, MAGNETISM, AND ELECTRICITY. 

HEAT. 

Under this head is included the expansion of minerals, their power 
of conducting, transmitting, or absorbing lieat, and tlieir fusibilit}'. Of 
these ijroperties fusibility is the most important, and the only one that 
can be readily illustrated. This propeity in mineralogy is a relative 
value, determined b}- comparison with a fixed scale, showing a regular 
gradation from 1, stibnite, the most readily fused; 2, natrolite; 3, gar- 
net; 4, actinolite; 5, orthoclase, to 6, bronzite, the most difficult. 

MAGNETISM. 

All minerals are either magnetic or nonmagnetic. Magnetic min- 
erals may be either paramagnetic, that is, attracted by the poles of a 



680 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

magnet, or diamagnetic, that is, repelled by the poles of a magnet. 
These characters can be illustrated properly only in the laboratory, 
and only those minerals possessing polarity, that is, being themselves 
magnetic, or those that are sensibly affected by an ordinary magnet, 
can be shown. 

ELECTRICITY. 

The electrical properties of minerals are distinguished by the follow- 
ing terms: Erictional electricity, or the power of becoming electrified 
by friction. Pyroelectricity, or tlie development of electricity through 
change of temperature. Thermoelectricity, due to differences of tem- 
perature at the point of contact with another substance, and is the 
electro-motive force developed when two or more minerals which are at 
different temperatures are brouglit in contact and establish an electric 
circuit. 

E — CHARACTERS DEPENDING UPON THE ACTION OF LIGHT. 

LIGHT. 

Light is the sensation produced upon the eye resulting from the 
excitation of a vibratory motion by a luminous body in the particles of 
a highly elastic imponderable medium called ether, which is assumed 
to pervade all space, including the most minute pores of all matter, 
whether solid, li(iuid, or gaseous. These vibrations are propagated in 
straight lines and in all directions from the luminous point. The small- 
est portion of light which can be separated is called a ray, and it may 
be considered as a combination of two vibrating motions, one of which 
for the sake of convenience may be regarded as vertical and the other 
horizontal. A ray of light will pass through any medium of the same 
density in a perfectly straight line, but if it pass out of that medium 
into another of different density it may be disposed of in different ways, 
being either transmitted, absorbed, reflected, refracted, or polarized. 

TRANSMISSION OF LIGHT. 

Diaphaneity. — All bodies transmit light to a greater or less degree. 
Among minerals the amount of light transmitted, or the degrees of 
transparency, are classed as: 

Transparent — when the outline of an object seen through the min- 
eral is perfectly distinct. Subtransparent — when an object may be 
seen but its outline is indistinct. Translucent — when light is trans- 
mitted but objects are not seen. Subtranslucent — when merely the 
edges are translucent. Opaque — when no light is transmitted. The 
property of diaphaneity occurs in every degree among minerals and is 
here represented in its several shades by five specimens of quartz. 

ABSOHrTION OF LIGHT. 

Color. — The color of a mineral depends upon its power of absorbing 
certain portions of light; that is, absorbing certain rays of the spec- 



I 



THE PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. 681 

tium that pass throu<j:li or fall upon its surface. A yellow mineral, 
for example, will absorb all the rays of the spectrum except the yellow; 
a green mineral will retiect chiefly green rays, while a white mineral 
will reflect all, and a black mineral will absorb all the rays. The color, 
then, is the result of the mixture of those rays of light which are not 
absorbed. The color of a mineral is of two kinds — essential and non- 
essential. 

EHseiitinl color, — The essential color is that of the mineral itself in 
its purest state, and belongs not only to the mass, but to the flnest par- 
ticle that can be mechanically divided. The essential color is deter- 
mined by the color of the fine powder of the mineral, or by rubbing 
it on a surface of unglazed porcelain. The color of this powder or 
mark is known as the streak. This character is illustrated by a series 
of twenty-two minerals. To the left of each specimen is a small vial 
containing the powder of the mineral. It will be observed that although 
in many cases the essential color and that of the mineral are the same, 
in others the color of the streak differs from that of the mass. 

Nonessential eolor. — The nonessential color is in general that of the 
impurities contained in the mineral and the color of the mass will difter 
from that of the streak; that is, the same mineral species may display 
several diflerent colors, all of which disappear in powder. 

This nonessential character of the color is seen in specimens of quartz 
and fluorite, in which the several distinct colors of the individual 
masses all disappear in the powder. 

Varieties of color. — The variations in color are classed, flrst, as 
metallic and non metallic, and all shades are referred to eight funda- 
mental colors: white, gray, black, blue, green, yellow, red, and brown. 
Second, according to peculiarities in the arrangement of colors, as play 
of color, o])alescence, iridescence, tarnish, and asterism. Third, as to 
the ditterence in color shown for light transmitted in different direc- 
tions through the crystal. This case of color absorption is called 
pleochroism and is peculiar to doubly-refracting minerals. Further, 
certain minerals when viewed under given conditions i)resent a bluish 
appearance, resulting from the absorption of certain rays of light. This 
property is called fluorescence. 

The princii)al metallic colors are showu in the following series of 
minerals. These are: 

Copper red : Native copper, Longfellow Miue, Clifton, Arizona (Cat. No. 83558,

EMISSION OF LIGHT — I'lIOSPIIORESCENCE. 

Phosphorescence, or the emission of Iijj:ht, may ))e produced in differ- 
ent ways — by rise of temperature, by mechanical effects (such as fric- 
tion, percussion, or cleav^ age) and by insolation — that is, by exj)0sure to 
the direct action of sunliglit. 

Piiosphorescence by rise of temperature is best seen in fluorite (Cat. 
No. 49598, U.S.N.M.), when heated to 145° or 150^, and especially in 
the variety chlorophane. 

Phosphorescence by friction will result from rubbing the specimen of 
sphalerite (Cat. No. 125G2, U.S.N.M.) in the dark. 

Pho.sphorescence by insolation is seen in some diamonds, such as the 
specimen shown, and in some varieties of fluorite, such as chloroj)hane. 

REFLKCTIOX OF LIGHT. 

When a ray of light passes from one medium to another, a i)ortion of 
it is always thrown back or reflected. Every substance in nature pos- 
sesses in a greater or less degree the power of reflecting the light 
rays which fall upon it. The amount of light reflected depends mainly 
upon the condition of the surface of the substance. 

Luster. — Among minerals luster is that character depending upon 
the power and manner of reflecting light, and is dependent upon the 
nature of the reriecting surface and the quantity or intensity of the 
light reflected. The kinds of luster are: Metallic, submetallic, adaman- 
tine, vitreous, resinous, pearly, and silky. The degrees of intensity 
are: Splendent, shining, glistening, glimmering, and dull. 

The specimens showing the different kinds and degrees of luster are : 

Metallic: Galena, Herniosa, New Mexico (Cat. No. 48173, U. S.N.M.); collected by

Glimmerinij : Chalcedony, Faroe Islands (Cat. No. 82224, U.S.N.M.). 

Dull: Kaolin, Berks County, Pennsylvania (Cat. No. 9783, U.S.N.M.). 

REFRACTION OF LIGHT. 

A ray of light passing from one medium to another which is of 
different density, and in a direction other than that of a perpendicular to 



684 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

the surface of the second medium, changes its direction or is refracted. 
When light passes from a rarer to a denser medium, it is refracted 
toward the perpendicular; if from a denser to a rarer medium, it is 
refracted away from the perpendicular. 

These conditions are universally true, and may be summarized as 
folh)\vs: When light passes from a denser to a rarer medium, the angle 
of incidence is less than the angle of refraction. When light passes 
out of a rarer into a denser medium, the angle of incidence is greater 
than the angle of refraction. The latio existing between the sines of 
the angles of incidence and refraction is called the index of refraction. 
This is constant for the same substance. 

The above assumes the existence of only one refracted ray; but there 
are sometimes two refracted rays, whence it follows that an object seen 
through such a medium appears double. Crystals which possess this 
peculiarity are said to be double refracting. It is possessed to a greater 
or less degree by all crystals which belong to systems of crystallizatiou 
other than the isometric. 

Uniaxial and biaxial crystals. — In all double-refracting crystals there 
is one direction, and sometimes a second, possessing the following prop- 
erty: When a point is looked at through the crystal in such a direc- 
tion, it does not appear double. The lines iixing these directions are 
called optic axes. 

A crystal is uniaxial when it has one optic axis; that is, when there is 
but one direction along which a ray of light can pass without being 
doubly refracted. A crystal having two such axes is called biaxial. 
Further, of the two parts into which the incident ray is divided on 
entering a uniaxial crystal, one is called the ordinary and the other the 
extraordinary ray. The one follows the law of single refraction; the 
other, except under certain conditions, does not. The magnitude of the 
refractive indices of these two rays always differ for the same crystal, 
and should that of the ordinary ray exceed that of the extraordinary 
ray the crystal is negative uniaxial; should the contrary be the case 
the crystal is positive uniaxial. 

DIFFRACTION OF LIGHT. 

If a beam of light be made to pass through a narrow slit and by the 
edge of an opaque body and to fall upon an appropriately placed screen, 
the shadow of such a body will be divided into a series of light and 
dark parallel bands, and the rays are diffracted. These bands or 
fringes are due to the mutual reaction or interference of the adjoining 
waves of light. Models 1 and 2 are of waves of light. The third model 
shows the waves of 1 and 2 neutralized by superposition and interfer- 
ence of two e(pial systems, the raised part of one wave fitting into and 
making smooth the hollow of the other. The next iigure represents the 
solar spectrum, showing the dark lines, called Fraunhofer's lines, which 



I 



THE PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. 685 

are tlie result of interference. The last model shows the effect of inter- 
ference in monochromatic or homogeneous light. With common light 
the prismatic colors are shown in succession. 

I'OLARIZATION OK LIGHT. 

" Polarization is, in general, that change in the character of reflected 
or transmitted light which diminishes its power of being further reflected 
or transmitted." To follow up the mechanical notion of the nature of 
polarized light it is necessary to refer to the wave model of common 
light, and by separating the two parts one from the other it maj' be 
shown how a wave of common light is reducible to two primary waves 
whose vibrations take place in a single })lane only, or are polarized. 

Light may be polarized by reflection and simple refraction, double 
refraction, and absorption. The first model shows a mechanical con- 
ception of a ray of common light made up of the transversal vibrations 
A and !>. The second model is a wire bent to represent a horizontal 
vibration which, if kept in that position, Avill pass only through a hori- 
zontal aperture; the third model is a wire bent to represent a per- 
pendicular vibration which will pass only through a perpendicular 
aperture. The next model illustrates polarization by means of reflec- 
tion and single refraction; A- A is a model of a bundle of glass plates 
placed at an angle of 56° 45' ; B is a ray of common light; C shows the 
light polarized by reflection and D by refraction. 

Polarization by double refraction is shown by a glass model represent- 
ing a rhomb of calcite. A ray of light, A, entering the rhomb is doubly 
refracted, or divided into two rays of polarized light. One of these 
rays, O, conforms with the law of ordinary refraction, and is called the 
ordinary ray ; the other does not conform with the law, and is called the 
extraordinary ray E. 

Polarization by absorption is shown by the next model, in which a 
slice of tourmaline is regarded, mechanically, as being like a grating 
through which polarized light may iiass, then A is the model of a slice 
of tourmaline into which the transversal vibrations, B, are passing; the 
horizontal wave is absorbed and the vertical polarized one passes to the 
second slice of tourmaline, 0, where the bars (the axes) being at right 
angles to those of A, it is stopped, and can pass through only when the 
bars of C are parallel to those of A. 

INTERFERENCE FIGURES. 

If a section of a doubly refracting mineral, which is cut perpendicular 
to an oi)tic axis, be examined in polarized light it will exhibit, under 
certain conditions, coloreil rings or bands. According to the undnla- 
tory theory of light tiiese rings arise from the interference of the waves 
of the ordinary and extraordinary rays. 

The observation of the systems of rings, or interference figures, which 
tliiii jdates of crystals give in polarized light affords a ready means of

(letermiiiiug the system in which a mineral crystalHzes. All minerals 
may be classed as either isotropic or anisotropic with reference to their 
behavior m light. Anisotropic minerals may be further divided in 
accordance with their behavior in polarized light, into uniaxial and 
biaxial. 

Isotropic class. — This class includes all amorphous and isometric min- 
erals. If a section of such a mineral be examined in polarized light 
under given conditions, the field of view remains dark and a revolution 
of -the section in any plane i)roduces no change in appearance. 

Anisotropic class, uniaxial minerals. — Includes all tetragonal and hex- 
agonal minerals. If a section of such a mineral, cut perpendicular to 
the vertical axis, be examined in polarized light under given conditions, 
the field of view remains dark in the center, but round this center is 
seen a series of concentric colored rings intersected by a dark cross. 
No alteration takes place when the section is rotated around the normal 
to its faces. (See models.) 

Anisotropic class, biaxial minerals. — This includes all orthorhombic, 
monoclinic and triclinic minerals. If a section of such a mineral, cut at 
right angles to a line bisecting the angle of the optic axes, be examined 
in polarized light under certain conditions, the field of view remains 
dark at two points, each of which is the center of a series of colored 
rings which in one position are intersected by a dark cross. In another 
position the dark cross is replaced by two dark curved bauds, or 
brushes, each of which passes through the center of one of the sets of 
rings. (See models.) 

DISPERSION OF THE OPTIC AXES. 

In all biaxial crystals there are three directions in which light ether 
is propagated with its maximum, minimum, and mean velocities. These 
directions are known as the axes of elasticity and are found in directions 
at right angles to each other. 

The plane of the optic axes must include the axis of greatest and of 
least elasticity, these two serving as bisectrices for the acute and 
obtuse angles formed by the intersection of the optic axes. When the 
acute bisectrix is the angle of least elasticity the crystal is called posi- 
tive, and when the axis is that of greatest elasticity it is called negative. 

Crystals possessing three axes of elasticity have also three indices 
of refraction. Furthermore, the direction of the optic axes changes for 
rays of different colored light, giving a larger optic axial angle for some 
rays than for others. Such a change in direction is known as the 
dispersion of the optic axes. 

The two cases possible are distinguished l>y writing p> v when the 
angle for the red rays (p) is greater than for the violet (f), and /j<j' 
when the converse is true. 

Orthorhombic dispersion. — In orthorhombic crystals the position of 
the three axes of elasticity corresponds with that of the crystallographic 



THE PROPERTIES OF MINERALS. 687 

axes; consequently the optic axes must lie in one of the three piuacoidal 
phiues, and syniinetrical dispersion takes phice in this i)lane. The 
model shows the dispersion in this case. The position of the axes of 
elasticity is indicated by the white threads, that of the optic axes by 
the red and blue threads. The vertical axis is the acute bisectrix, and 
red (/j) is greater than violet (p); hence /j>r. 

Monorlinic flispersion — In monoclinic crystals one of the axes of elas- 
ticity corresponds in position to the crystallograi)hic axis h, and the 
other two lie in a plane of symmetry at right angles to it. Conse- 
quently there are three cases of dispersion possible, depending upon 
which two of the three axes lie in the plane of symmetry. These 
kinds of dispersion are: inclined, when the plane of the optic axes is 
the symmetry plane of crystal, in which case unsymmetrical dispersion 
of the axes and bisectrices takes j)lace; horizontal, when the plane of 
the optic axes is at right angles to the plane of symmetry and the 
acute bisectrix and axis of mean elasticity lie in this plane; crossed, 
when the plane of the optic axes is at right angles to the plane of sym- 
metry and the acute bisectrix corresponds to the crystallographic axis 
6, so that the obtuse bisectrix and the axis of mean elasticity lie in 
the idane of symmetry. The three models following show the several 
kinds of monoclinic dispersion, and are described as follows: 

Inclined. — The dispersion in this case is unsymmetrical. The posi- 
tion of the optic axes is indicated by red and blue threads. (Ireenish- 
yellow is the acute bisectrix for red and orange-yellow for blue. The 
dark-green thread is the obtuse bisectrix for red and grass-green for 
blue. The crystallographic axes are in white, axis h corresponding 
to that of mean elasticity. 

Horizontal. — In this case the dispersion is symmetrical. The posi- 
tion of the optic axes is shown by the red and blue threads. Orange 
yellow is the acute bisectrix for red and greenish-yellow for blue. The 
crystallographic axes are in white, with axis h the obtuse bisectrix and 
not dispersed. 

Crossed. — The dispersion in this case is symmetrical. The position 
of the optic axis is shown by the red and blue threads. Grass-green 
is the obtuse bisectrix for red and dark-green for blue. The crystallo- 
graphic axes are in white, with axis h as the acute bisectrix and not 
dispersed, 

Triclinic dispersion. — In triclinic crystals none of the axes of elas- 
ticity correspond to the crystallographic axes; consequently they have 
no fixed i)osition. Complete unsymmetrical dispersion of the optic 
axes, their plane, and of the bisectrices takes place. 

The model shows the unsymmetrical dispersion. The position of the 
optic axes is indicated by the red and blue threads. Orange-yellow is 
the acute bisectrix for red and greenish-yellow for blue. The grass- 
green thread is the obtuse bisectrix for red, dark-green for blue. The 
crystallographic axes are in white.

F — CHARACTERS DEPENDING UPON THE ACTION OF THE SENSES. 



The touch of a mineral is described as : greasy, the feel of talc; meager, 
dry and rough to the touch like chalk; harsh, having the feel of actin- 
olite; smooth, having the feel like a face of a (inartz <a-ystal; adhesive 
when it adheres to the tongue, as in the case of hydrophane. 



The taste is a character of soluble minerals only, and is described as: 
astringent, the taste of chalcanthite; sweetish astringent, the taste 
of kalinite; saline, the taste of halite; alkaline, the taste of natron; 
cooliug, the taste of niter; bitter, the taste of ei)somite. 

ODOR. 

Certain minerals, under the influence of friction, moistening with the 
breath, or by the action of heat or acids, give off odors, which are des- 
ignated thus: bituminous, the odor of bitumen, as in elaterite; sul- 
phurous, the odor of burning sulphur, as in pyrite when heated or under 
friction; alliaceous, the garlic-like odor given off by arsenopyrite 
when heated or under friction; fetid, the odor of sulphureted hydro- 
gen given oft' under friction by some varieties of quartz and limestone; 
argillaceous, the clayey odor given olf by kaolin upon being moistened. 

G— CHARACTERS DEPENDING UPON RESISTANCE TO CHEMICAL 

ACTION. 

CORROSION FIGURES. 

When a crystal is exposed a short time to the action of a solvent, its 
faces are not equally attacked, but are corroded into jjit-like figures 
whose forms obey the law of symmetry of the crystal. These figures 
are often of assistance in determining the grade of symmetry of a crys- 
tal, which IS not apparent by the development of its faces. Corrosion 
figures will also indicate the presence of twins. Examples of these 
are shown in ;i crystal of ])yrite which has been dipped in warm nitric 
acid, and in those of calcite, boracite, barite, galena and (quartz. 

SOLUTION ri.ANKS. 

In every crystal there is a set of structure planes along which chem- 
ical action takes place most easily. These planes have definite relations 
with tlie symmetry of the crystal; for exauiple, the solution planes in 
the specimen of calcite shown are parallel to the faces of a scalenohe- 
dron. Further, in many crystals, wheu they have been subjected to 
intense strain, planes of easy solution may arise in directions parallel 
to that along which the strain is exerted.

INTRODUCTION. 

The IT. S. S. Mohican sailed from the port of Callao, Peru, March 6, 1868, 
under orders for a protracted cruise, on special duty, among the islands 
of the South Pacific, with instructions, on her return passage to the South 
American coast, to call at Easter Island, make certain investigations 
desired by the Smithsonian Institution, and especially to bring away 
one of the colossal stone images to be found upon the island. 

After a passage of thirty-two days the Marquesas group was reached, 
but the authorities, wishing to impose quarantine upon the ship, a stay 
of a few hours only was made, and we pushed on to the island of Eairoa, 
in the Tuamotu, or Low Archipelago. From thence the ship visited, 
at various times, and in some instances repeatedly, the Society Islands, 
the Samoan Group, the Tonga Group, the Fiji Islands, and IS^ew 
Zealand, and took her final departure from Tahiti for Easter Island 
and the South American coast November 16, dropping anchor in Hanga 
Eoa Bay, west coast Rapa Nui, December 18. 

The stone image, stone crown, and stone head, for the Smithsonian 
Institution, having been successfully transported over the island to 
the beach and thence transferred on board, the ship sailed on the last 
day of the year for Valparaiso, Chile, arriving at the latter port January 
14, 1887, having performed the duty assigned her, in which all on board 
took the liveliest interest. 

The writer has confined himself, as strictly as circumstances would 
admit, to the line of investigation assigned him, in order that there 
might not be a needless repetition in the reports of the several ofiicers 
concerned in the work. 

In the preparation and collation of the glossary the writer has been 

ably assisted by Lieut. William E. Saiiord, U. S. N.

EXPEDITION AROUND THE COAST LINE. 

The investigations upon wliich this report is based cover a period of 
twelve daj's, from December 19 to December 30, 188G, inclusive, and 
were conducted in association with two other officers (the paymaster 
and the navigator) of the ship, to whon), as to the writer, special duties, 
predicated upon the information desired by the Smithsonian Institution, 
were assigned, resi)ectively. 

The Mohican anchored in the roadstead of the Hanga Roa, Rapa Nui, 
in the forenoon of Saturday, December 18, and on the morning of the 
19th the writer proceeded ashore and immediately began his duties. On 
that day the crater of Rana Kao was visited and a general insi)ection 
was made of the stone huts, the painted slabs in their interior, the 
sculptured rocks, etc., and of the crater itself, in the immediate vicinity 
of which these objects of interest are located. At 3 o'clock p. m. the 
party returned to the house of Mr. John Brander, near the base of the 
volcano, from which we had taken our departure in the morning, and 
toward evening, mounting a wagon, were driven to the residence of Mr. 
Alexander P. Salmon at Yaihu, distant 5 miles, on the southeast coast 
of the island and formerly a Catholic mission. 

At an early hour on Monday morning, December 20, we were driven 
back to the house of Mr. Brander, obtaining a view of the Obsidian 
Mountain as we skirted its base, and shortly after ascended Rana Kao, 
accompanied by a detail of men from the ship, with the necessary imple- 
ments and instruments for making excavations and surveying. Private 
Anton Ayasse, of the marine guard of the ship, a clever draftsman, 
also accompanied the party for the purpose of making sketches of 
objects of interest. 

The entire day was passed upon the mountain and a large amount of 
work i)erformed, in the way of exploring the stone houses, inspecting 
the sculptured rocks in the vicinity, excavating, etc. Toward evening 
the descent was made and the night was passed at the house of Mr. 
Brander with somewhat more of comfort than had attended the pre- 
vious one. 

On the following morning, Tuesday, December 21, early preparations 
were made for the expedition around the entire coast line of the island. 
Four native men, named Huki, Luka, Haie, and Brotto, were engaged 
as guides and general utility men, with two pack horses for carrying 
camp equipage and provisions. jSTine men, including the chief quarter- 
master of the ship, a boatswain's mate, and private Ayasse as drafts- 
man, were detailed to accompany the party with tools for excavating, 
etc. The j^aymaster and navigator, with the writer and a naval cadet 
as assistant to the navigator, comprised the officers, and a young Ameri- 
can, Mr. Frank Allen, in the employ of Mr. Salmon, went along as 
interpreter. 

All being ready, the party started from the house of Mr, Brander at 



TE PITO TE HENUA OR EASTER ISLAND. 693 

8 o'clock in the morning of the day mentioned, and, passing through 
the villages of Mataveri and Hanga Eoa, struck the coast line abreast 
of the ship at Hanga Roa l^>ay on the western side of the island, and 
thence proceeded in a northerly direction. The indentations of the 
coast were closely followed ; every part of the ground carefully exam- 
ined; each image platform discovered was accurately measured and 
platted on the chart prepared for the purpose; the number of stone 
images was noted, and where there were "indications" excavations 
were made; crania, when uncovered and in good condition, were pre- 
served; caves were visited and searched; the bearings of promon- 
tories, points of land, mountains, etc., were taken for corrections on the 
chart, and so on. The work was tedious and laborious; the ground 
gone over was rugged and uneven, rocky at times, at others densely 
strewn with volcanic bowlders of every shape and size, the sharp points 
of which proved very trying to the feet. Again, our path lay over 
ground covered with hummock grass, the hard tufts of wliich made 
insecure footing and caused frequent turning and spraining of the 
ankles. Then, too, it was necessary to retrace our steps oftentimes, as 
well as to follow the windings of the cliffs, so that, although constantly 
moving from place to place, our progress in a direct line was slow and 
the work exhausting in the extreme. 

Toward the middle of the afternoon two of the natives, who were 
thoroughly acquainted with the region and who reported " good water" 
at a certain point ahead, with two of our own people, taking with them 
the pack animals, were sent forward to select a camping i)lace for the 
night. Subsequently one of the natives returned and piloted us to 
the point selected, at a considerable distance from the sea, which we 
reached at 5 p. m., weary but in excellent spirits. We found here an 
inviting-looking place, covering a space of about a hundred feet square, 
inclosed by a stone wall and with banana trees, stalks of sugar cane, 
and taro growing in profusion. Inside was the opening to a small but 
comfortable cave, sufficiently large to accommodate all our people, who 
were assigned to it, while a tent, improvised of blankets and water- 
proof coats, was erected outside the inclosure against another stone 
wall for the accommodation of the officers. It having been suggested 
by the writer that for convenience of future reference we name our 
nightly stopping places, this, our flrst night's abode, was, by unanimous 
consent, christened "Camp Mohican." 

Although the distance on the chart in a straight line from our start- 
ing point in the morning to the site of our first camp measured but 
about 5 miles, we must have traversed fully three times that space 
in going around headlands and bays, crossing and recrossing, inspect- 
ing and measuring platforms. 

Soon after a hearty meal, a constituent of which was baked lamb, 
Rapa Nui style (18,000 head of sheep roam the island), and a comfort- 
able smoke, darkness coming on, all hands turned in for the night, the 



694 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

meu into their cave, the officers into their tent. Previously to doing 
so, however, we took precaution to stuff our ears with paper, in order 
to exclude the " snapping beetle," one of the Ulateridcc, credited by 
the natives with a predilection for that organ, and myriads of which 
had been assailing us. 

Our bed was composed of the moku — native grass — over which we 
placed our rubber sheets. At 2 o'clock in the morning we were 
awakened by a heavy rain storm, against which our Himsy patchwork 
tent proved but poor protection, the water either pouring through or 
running under our bed of litter. 

On Wednesday, December 22, after a hearty breakfast, finding that 
we were none the worse for the previous night's experience, we struck 
camp, the pack animals were loaded, and at an early hour we were 
uuder way again. Our course this day continued along the coast line to 
the northward and around North Cape, skirting the base of Rana Hana 
Kaua. The shore all along this part of the island is bold, locky, pre- 
cipitous, the black frowning basalt cliffs rising in many places to the 
height of hundreds of feet, truly an "iron-bound" coast, upon which 
the seas break with terrific fury, dashing the spray high in the air. 
The powerful solvent action of sea water upon even the hardest vol- 
canic rock may here be seen exemplified in the fantastic shapes wrought 
by the waves on every side, the arches cut through, the innumerable 
caves excavated in the face of the cliflfs, the pinnacles, towers, basins, 
etc., visible at every step. Many of the caverns were explored, and 
human and other bones found in some of them. The character of the 
surface land was about the same as on the preceding day, and the 
tramp over rocks and stones was a weary and trying one. 

During the afternoon a detail of men was again sent ahead to locate 
the camp for the night, near a fresh-water spring known to the natives, 
and which the remainder of the party reached toward sunset. This, 
which we named "Camp Day" in honor of our commanding officer, was 
situated in the district of Yal-maitai (good water), near Motukan 
Point, about 3 miles distant from our camp of the night before, but 
fully three times as many by the route we had taken. One of the 
natives was sent back to the ship, with a note, for additional supply of 
stores. Two caves were occupied at this camp, one by the officers, the 
other being allotted to the men. 

Despite the promising name of the district, the water again proved 
bad, being brackish. A couple of sheep had been captured and dressed, 
and from these and canned food, garnished with taro, sweet j)otatoes, 
and bananas, baked by the natives in their inimitable way, and washed 
down with copious drafts of tea, an excellent meal was made. Our 
cave proved a damp, ill-smelling place, and visions of pneumonia, rheu- 
matism, and other resultant affections dominated our dreams, render- 
ing sleep fickle and unrefreshing. 

At 7.30 on the morning of Thursday, December 23, we were again 



TE PITO TE HENUA OR EASTER ISLAND. 695 

uuder way and continued our route along tlie cliffs on the north shore 
of the island. At platform No, 29 a pit was excavated in which a col- 
lection of human skulls, without any other portion of the remains, was 
found. Our track this day led us to Anakena Bay, according to tradi- 
tion the original landing place of King Hotu-Metua, his queen, and 
followers, from whom the present inhabitants claim their descent. We 
found at the head of the bay a fine, extensive sand beach, the first we 
had fallen in with, forming a good landing place for small boats. The 
breakers and still water in the vicinity were seen swarming with fish of 
several varieties, of which the natives gave us their names. The sand 
beaches were thickly strewn with the ''Portuguese man-of-war" {Phy- 
salia utriculus), called by the natives PapaJcl, and which, to the writer's 
great surprise, they informed him was eaten by them as food. Adher- 
ent to the rocks was found the singular, cuirass-covered little creature, 
called by the natives hemoma, one of the Chitons, perhaps the magi- 
nificus, which is also used by them as an article of diet. Thus, also, a 
small univalve, called by them nginf/ongiy large collections of the shells 
of which were found stowed away in the walls of the stone huts at the 
edge of the crater, on Eana Kao, where also was found the remains of 
the Chiton. The sea urchin. Echinus (esculentusf), in Rapa ^m-hetuM, 
and a diminutive snail, which they call 2^>Ph were found at Anakena, 
All the above form a part of their dietary, and they seemed to speak of 
and regard them as tidbits. 

Sometime was passed at Anakena, exploring its vicinity where, there 
is every reason to suppose, an extensive town existed, for which the 
nature of the surface, ascending gradually from the water's edge to 
high land on either side, with a hill rising between and running back 
into the interior, forms a most admirable site. The remains of former 
habitations were found in various directions. At some distance back 
from the sea on rising ground, in an isolated position, far removed from 
any platform or image, was found the largest tufa crown we had yet 
seen and which subsequent investigation proved the largest on the 
island. It was slightly oval in shape, lay on its side, was buried in the 
earth to a depth of about 2 feet, and by actual measurement was 27 feet 
9 inches in circumference, 9 feet 9 inches in diameter across the long 
and 9 feet 2 inches across the short oval, and 9 feet high. 

Beyond Anakena Bay the walking became especially difficult and 
laborious at one point, near Ovahe Bay, it was necessary to scale the 
face of a cliff, at about midway of its height, on a narrow ledge of rock. 

Our camp, named " Whitney," for the honorable Secretary of the 
Navy, was located for this night near Hangaone Bay, about 4 miles 
from our starting point of the morning, and it was nearly dark when 
we entered its welcome precincts. Supj)lies from the ship, brought by 
the boat, which had been nearly all day reaching Anakena, were carried 
thence overland and arrived in camp during the evening. 

Near our present camping ground we found the best water of any 



696 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

during- our entire trip and we duly commended our guides, accordingly, 
much to their gratiiicatiou. I was much surprised when, next morning, 
on visiting the well, or spring, situated immediately adjoining one of 
the image ])latforms, 1 found it nothing more than a shallow excavation 
among the loose stones, and covered in order to keep the cattle and 
sheep from drinking the precious fluid, of which there was but a few 
inches in depth remaining. The water was surface water only, and had 
percolated between the rocks, into the cavity, after rains. The knowl- 
edge that these image platforms, have, from time immemorial even 
unto the j)resent day, been utilized as burial places by the natives, did 
not enhance our enjoyment of the liquid. 

The men slept in a comfortable cave that night, and for our own 
accommodation an overhanging shelf of rock was economized. This was 
too narrow to entirely shelter the party, and the deficiency of rock 
was, therefore, supplemented with blankets, banana leaves, etc., laid 
upon cords stretched in various directions. The scheme i^roved a 
delusion, for the post-midnight showers descended as usual, the banana 
leaves formed admirable conduits to lead the water where it did the most 
harm, and the customary hasty vacating of the den in the night was 
the inevitable result. These successive nocturnal experiences served to 
impress on our minds the absurdity of leaving the ship unprovided 
with a suitable tent, or at least an old sail with which necessary shelter 
could be improvised. 

We struck camp and got away early, sending the camp builders with 
the pack animals overland to the south side of the island, where at a 
certain place, as the natives informed us, a tine, roomy cave and good 
water would be found, and which was decided upon as our next camp. 

Our own course continued along the north coast around Cape Poko- 
koria, along the east shore to Cape Anaataavanui, and thence in a 
westerly direction along the south coast to camp, near Hanga Nui Bay 
and Point Onetea. 

During the early part of the day the ground was of the same rugged 
nature as that already passed over, but on reaching the base of Mount 
Pua-ko-taki, at the eastern end of the island, the character of the sur- 
face changed, being covered with hummock grass, alternating with 
extensive tracts of fine, red volcanic sand, and dust, more particu- 
larly on the northern and eastern slopes of the mountain. It was 
asserted that in this red sand most of the stone axes and other imple- 
ments were to be found, particularly after strong gales, when they 
were uncovered by the wind, and careful search was made accordingly, 
but with indifferent success. After luncheon, partaken of on toj) of 
the mountain, the descent, which was gradual, as was also the ascent, 
was made on the eastern side, the ground being of the same sandy 
nature. Diligent search was again made while traversing this, and a 
few specimens of stone implements, in large part mutilated, were 
obtained. 



TE PITO TE HENUA OR EASTER ISLAND. 697 

In traveling southward, along the slope of the mountain, on again 
approaching tlie region of grass it was singular to observe the line of 
demarcation. The sand, moved by the winds, was gradually encroaching 
upon the vegetation, the depth of the edge being about G inches. The 
contrast between the deep red of the one and the vivid green of the 
other was very striking, and the line was as straight, regular, and 
clearlj- drawn, with fertility on one side and barrenness on the other, 
as any of a similar nature seen by the writer in Egypt. 

The walking upon the sand, although tiresome, was easy as com- 
pared with that on the hummock grass, over which our route now lay. 
In our journeyings theretofore, although there was no regular paths 
and of course no roads, we were fortunate enough occasionally to strike 
a sheep or cattle trail, which afforded a welcome relief, however brief, 
to our jaded feet. There was nothing of the sort now — no avoiding of 
rough places, no choice of spots to plant a foot — and as we moved 
grimly onward, blundering at every step, tlie distance around Cape 
Auaataavanui seemed interminable. Thoroughly fatigued we reached 
the precipice, which terminated the plateau over which we had been 
struggling, and looking to the westward saw the welcome flags, still a 
mile distant, waving over our camp. The descent of the precipice at 
the j)oint reached being precarious, its edge was skirted until a more 
favorable place was found down which to scramble to the plain below. 
Here we presently struck a trail, which soon opened into a wagon road, 
whence a footpath led to the camp, which the writer (the party having 
been scattered since noon) reached at 4.30 in the afternoon. 

The situation of the camp, which was named "Baird '' in honor of the 
secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, was a delightful one, being 
located on the south side of the little bay of Hanga J^ui, at the base of 
a bluft" which partly sheltered it from the strong southeast trades, as 
well as the hot afternoon sun. Eana Roraka, from the crater and 
slopes of which all the monoliths on the island had been quarried, lay 
immediately to the left. Pua-ko-taki, over whose summit and around 
whose base we had toiled, loomed in front of us. Lying in the opening 
of our cave, we could gaze upon the great platform, Tongarika, with 
its fifteen prostrate stone images, the largest and most imposing on the 
island. At our feet, surging back and forth among the everlasting 
rocks as the swell rolled in from the open ocean, lay the sparkling- 
waters of the Hanga Nui Bay. 

The cave, called "Ana Havea" by the natives, ran back into the bluff 
a distance of 50 feet or more and laterally about 30. The entrance was 
spacious, and it was roomy, dry, and well ventilated, the trade wind, 
deflected by the blutt", sweeping nearly across its face. It was an ancient 
cavern, had been inhabited by the image builders, and was still occu- 
pied at times by the natives, as also by Messrs. Salmon and Brander 
when in this part of the island, engaged in rounding up their herds of 
cattle or sheep. The floor was strewn with dry litter, bull rushes and 



698 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1«97. 

grass. There were several elevated platforms, edged off with bowlders, 
wliicli were for sleeping places, and the remains of an ancient fireplace 
could be traced in one corner. Two huge rocks, with a flourishing 
tobacco plant growing between, guarded the entrance, from which a 
grass-covered lawn inclined downward to the rocks at the water side. 

The men were accommodated in another comfortable cave at about 
100 yards distance inland, and the camp fire waske])t brightly burning 
in a clear space among the bowlders on the declivity hard by. 

At no time during our trip were we without food. On the contrary, 
sheep were plentiful all over the island. Drinking water, so indispen- 
sable, and yet so scarce on Rapa Nui, was obtained from several sources 
near Camp Baird, but all was equally unpalatable. Our first supply 
(we remained at this camp about three days) was obtained from a 
so called Avell, half a mile distant, located among the rocks near the 
edge of the bay, and Avas salt at high water and more or less brackish 
at all times. 

The water from a spring discovered by Quartermaster Lowrie was 
also unpalatable, and a supply obtained from the crater of Rana Roraka, 
near by, owing to its animal and vegetable impurities, was more so. 
It is to this crater that by far the larger number of cattle resort to 
drink, and their grazing ground, for this reason, is mostly located on 
this part of the island. 

On the evening of our arrival, December 24, having partaken of a 
hearty dinner and lighted our cigars, we stretched ourselves, weary 
and foot sore, on the grass in front of our cave. The conversation, 
brisk and merry at first, soon flagged, became desultory, and presently 
ceased entirely. It was "the uight before Christmas;" our mere physi- 
cal, corporeal nature was pressing the soil of Raj)a Nui, but the spirit, 
our immaterial part, was many leagues away. 

At various times during our stay the writer purchased crania which 
the natives offered Tiim for sale, and among these were several skulls of 
ancient Kings, bearing peculiar marks which, Mr. Salmon assured him, 
he then saw for the first time, and of the genuineness of which he had no 
doubt. 

Christmas forenoon was passed in exjjloring the region in the vicinity 
of the camp, several cairns being opened with variable success in the 
matter of specimens. In the afternoon the crater of Rana Roraka was 
visited and note taken of the very numerous finished and unfinished 
images, some standing, others prostrate, scattered over its slope and 
the great plain at its base, where there is ev^ery reason to believe once 
stood a i^opulous town. The quarries, " workshops," were also visited 
and the many partly completed monoliths, still attached to the original 
rock, examined. As in Egypt, where, in the quarries at Syene, near the 
First Cataract, the largest obelisk still lies unfinished, so here, in one 
of the excavations on tl^e outer slope of the crater, may be seen the 
largest of the stone images to be found on Rapa Nui in an incomplete 



TE PITO TE IIEXUA OR EASTER ISLAND. 699 

coiulitiou, still adherent to the bed rock and measuring 69 feet 9 inches 
in length. 

That evening, after dark, the natives remaining with ns entertained 
us with an exhibition of their manner of capturing the crayfish. Strip- 
ped to the skill and holding aloft in the left hand a liugh lighted torch 
composed of loose fagots, they would Jump from rock to rock and 
bowlder to bowlder with the agility of monkeys. Peering into the 
depths below, and having discovered their prey, they would leap into 
the water, often to their necks, deftly seize the crustacean and pass it 
to a companion who, with another burning torch, attended them for the 
purpose. Again they would sight their game in a cleft, or under a sub- 
merged overhanging rock, and, swiftly inserting the hand, would rarely 
fail to bring forth a captive. For an hour or more the sport continued. 
The sight was a strange, wierd, savage, and interesting one, and the array 
of tua (Rapa Xui for crayfish), which at the termination of the hunt 
they proudly spread before us gave ample testimony to their dexterity. 

Sunday, December 26, the writer passed quietly in camp, and the 
following day was devoted to further explorations and excavations. 

Tuesday, December 28, we broke camp and abandoned Ana Havea, 
which had so long sheltered us, all the party, except the paymaster 
and writer, returning across the island to the shiii, which had been 
moved around to La Perouse Bay, on the north side of the island, for 
the more convenient transportation on board of the selected image. 

In company with Mr. Salmon, who had passed the previous night 
with us at the cave, and riding with him in his "buggy," we were 
taken to his house at Yaihu, formerly a Catholic mission but now 
abandoned as such. The church and parsonage, with outbuildings, 
are still standing, the former being used in part as a storehouse, 
while in the remaining portion divine service is held daily under 
native leadership. The parsonage, comprising three rooms, is occu- 
pied by Mr. Salmon as his dwelling, and he has here displayed a 
portion of his verj' curious, interesting, and valuable collection of 
Rapa Xui antiquities. 

It is but just to note, in this place, that too much credit can not 
be awarded Mr. Salmon for the great interest he takes in everything 
pertaining to the island — its history, its people, traditions, and remains. 
He is an enthusiast upon this subject, has made it a study of years, 
and has devoted time, money, and his best energies toward assisting 
in elucidating the mystery which envelops this isolated mid-ocean 
island, its hieroglyphs, its rock carvings, its colossal remains and the 
strange people who wrought them. Mr. Salmon has resided here for 
a period of seven years in all, and during that time, in addition to 
his large collection, he has made a study of his subject, has inter- 
ested himself in the natives and their improvement, and has accumu- 
lated a large amount of information, legends, and traditions, which 
otherwise, perhaps, would in a few years have perished with the people 



700 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

to whose ancestors it relates aud who seemed to be doomed to speedy 
extinction. 

During our stay at the ishind we were treated with every courtesy 
by Mr. Salmon, who placed every facility within his power at our 
disposal for the prosecution of our work, and I am indebted to him for 
much of the information embodied in this report. 

Wednesday, December 2J>, was devoted to explorations in the vicin- 
ity of Vaihu, to the collection of data, and taking of notes, and at 
7 o'clock in the evening drove to Mr. Brander's liouse, near the vil- 
lage of Mataveri, having thus completed the tour of the coast Hue of 
the island. That evening, in company with Mr. Salmon, a visit was 
made to Chief Ure Vaeiko, 83 years old, for the purpose of having 
him interpret the hieroglyphic writings on the wooden tablets and 
photographs. This he did into the Kapa Nui language, the interpre- 
tation being taken down by Mr. Salmon, stretched at full length in the 
litter constituting the floor of the house, and subsequently translated 
into English by him. The latter, with the paymaster, was engaged 
with this work through the entire night, and at 10 o'clock next morn- 
ing, the 30th, met the writer at Mr. Brander's house. A large portion 
of this day was devoted to visiting the villages, inspecting the houses, 
and making physical examinations. At 5 o'clock in the afternoon we 
returned to the house of Mr. Salmon, at Vaihu, where a note from the 
ship was received urging our immediate return, as the image had been 
received on board and the Mohican was to sail on the followiiig day. 

Another night was passed at the house of Mr. Salmon, and at 7 
o'clock on the morning of December 31, our preparations being com- 
pleted, we started on our return. The "buggy" was again brought 
into requisition and carried us as far as Rana Roraka, the road ter- 
minating at the corral at its base. Here we alighted, and the natives 
distributing and shouldering our implements, all hands except Mr. 
Salmon, who rode on horseback, struck out to cross the island on foot 
to La Perouse Bay. The distance was about 3 miles by the trail, which 
was rough and rocky but quite level, and was accomplislied in an hour. 
On the way we passed our camp of December 23 and 24, "Whitney," 
where a party of native men and women had spent the preceding, and 
it is to be hoped a drier, night than we did under the overhanging rock. 

We arrived at the landing in Hanga-one Bay, whence tlie image had 
been boated oil' to the ship after having been brought a distance of 2^ 
miles overland on a sled, at about o'clock in the morning, aud in a 
little while thereafter returned on board after an absence from the shij) 
of twelve days. At 3 o'clock the same afternoon, all financial matters 
having been concluded, and a number of sheep, the parting gifts of 
Messrs. Salmon and Brander, having been received on board, we bade 
farewell to our gentle Rapa Nui friends and steamed away for 
Valparaiso. 

We found the natives who accompanied us bright, willing, tractable, 



TE PITO TE HENUA OR EASTER ISLAND. 701 

tireless, anxious to please, and ready at all times, day or iiiglit, to do 
our bidding. Two of tliem, Ijuka and Iluki, were especially useful to 
us. The latter was the more intelligent of the two, and was remarkably 
well informed regarding everything pertaining to the island. He knew 
the name of every point, headland, bay, etc., and his replies to our 
questions were given without hesitancy and so correctly, as we found 
by testing him, that he frequently surprised us. The writer obtained 
much information from him, and might have gained much more, 
regarding the native plants, insects, shells, etc., but unfortunately our 
interpreter, who had been but a short time on the island, was practically 
useless as a medium between us, and to understand each other's meaning 
was therefore most difficult. Owing to this fact, the want of facilities 
and conveniences for collecting and preserving specimens, and the 
absence of works of reference, but little could be accomplished in the 
particulars above mentioned. 

A source of great annoyance to us during our trip was the hordes of 
flies which kept us company on the march, and then whenever we 
approached camp in the evening were greeted and cordially welcomed 
by other hordes which had been in previous possession of the locality. 
Many of the islands of the South Pacific are noted for the swarms of 
flies which infest them, one Eairoa, having been named by the navi- 
gator Schouten, 161G, Yliegen Islands by reason of the myriads which 
assailed and finally drove him to sea. 

Another, and in some respects even worse plague, was the fleas, 
which had their origin in the numerous dogs kept on the island. 

One more source of discomfort, in connection with our stay at the 
hospitable lesidence of Mr. Salmon, was the host of cockroaches which 
swarmed every part of the premises, measuring 2 or more inches in 
length, with antennnB to correspond, and furnished with wings of a 
beautiful glistening brown. 

TOPOGRAPHY. 

From the most reliable information obtainable it appears that the 
ancient naine of the island was Te Pita te hernia. Eeferring to the 
vocabulary it will be seen that the word Pito, in Rapa Nui signifies 
navel, and henua, the uterus. What association of ideas could have 
prompted these appellations it is, of course, difficult to imagine at the 
present day. The following speculations, which have occurred to the 
writer, are given for what they may be worth. The island is distinctly 
of volcanic origin, and on nearly all the hills and mountains the craters 
are clearly traceable, most markedly and startlingly so in the case of 
Rana Kao, at the southwest end. As will be seen, the craters of both 
volcanoes (all on the island are now extinct) are of great depth, with 
lakes of water at their bottoms. In the cases of the other volcanoes 
the (Taters are much more shallow, symmetrical, more evenly rounded, 
overgrown with grass, present a very striking and beautiful appear- 



702 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

ance, particularly when the slanting rays of the rising or setting sun 
shine upon them, and at that time especially, when they stand so 
prominently forth, would readily suggest the human navel, from which 
it may be inferred that i)ortion of the name of the island might be 
derived. 

Ivegarding the other word, henna, the uterus ; can it be that they 
meant to designate by this term the great volcano Eana Eoraka, in 
whose womb was created, and from whose vitals Avas born that host of 
monolithic images which once reared their colossal forms aloft, giant 
genii guarding these rock-bound shores, and which to day, prone and 
mutilated as they are, fill the mind of the voyager with wonder, awe, 
and admiration? 

Hiti te ciranga, the name said to have been given to the island by 
the English is, perhaps, a corruption of that above-mentioned, as is 
certainly also the name Te Pito fenua, wrongly stated as signifying 
"the land in the middle of the sea." The name Rapa Nui, signifying 
Great Eapa, is modern, having been given to the island by the Tahiti- 
ans twenty years since, to distinguish it from Ra2)a iti, Little Eapa, 
otherwise called Oparo, an island Ij'ing 1,900 miles to the westward, in 
the direction of the Society Group, which latter is 2,500 miles distant. 
The name Easter was given the island by Roggeween, who discovered 
it on Easter Sunday, 1721. It has also been called by various names, 
such as Teapy and Waihu. 

It has often been subject of remark that this proijensity of giving 
new, modern, European names to lands and islands, not only when 
originally discovered, but often when merely revisited, may be con- 
sidered as not only in questionable taste, but as leading to endless con- 
fusion. The charts and Sailing Directions are replete with instances 
of that sort, cases occurring when perhaps half a dozen modern and 
strangely appearing names, each by a different navigator, are applied 
to one small island or group of islands. The spelling of the native 
names is also, in many instances, wide of the mark. These strictures 
may be said to apply with special force to the island under considera- 
tion, and, therefore, in these reports and on the corrected chart its 
ancient name, as well as the native names of its mountains, bays, 
and headlands, have been adhered to as closely as practicable, while 
at the same time the greatest care has been exercised in spelling them 
phoneticallj' as received from the natives. 

Since its discovery the island has been visited at successive times 
by Cook and La Ferouse; by the H. M. S. Blossom in 1825, and Topane 
in 1808; by the Chilean gunboat O^Higf/insin 1870 and 1875; by the 
H. M. S. Sappho in 1882, and by the German gunboat Hywne in the 
same year. 

The IT. S. S. Mohican arrived at the island December 18 and sailed 
December 31, 1886. 

The distance to the nearest inhabited island to the westward, Pit- 



TE PITO TE HENUA OR EASTER ISLAND. 703 

cairu, is 1,100 miles, aud the South American coast is 2,100 miles to 
the eastward. 

The islaud is irregularly triangular in shape. Its greatest length 
from KE. to SW. is 13 miles; its greatest width from North Cape to 
Cape Hoe-Hoe, in a direction from IsTNW. to SSE., is 7 miles. The cir- 
cumference, measuring from headland to headland, is about 34 miles, 
and the area of the island is 34 square miles. 

The surface is diversified mountain and i^laiu, the former usually 
rising abruptly from the latter, and generally at a distance from each 
other, so that, with one or two exceptions, it can hardly be said that 
there are valleys, strictly si^eaking. The mountains — a goodly number 
in proportion to the area of the island — are mostly cone shaped, and 
not of very great elevation, the tallest, near Cape North, being but 1,767 
feet high. The most extensive plain is at the base of Eana Koraka, 
extending thence in a westerly direction for several miles, and it is 
believed that in ancient times a large town existed on this site, in whose 
vicinity all the monoliths were carved. 

The coast line on the southern and western sides, except at the ex- 
treme southwest end where Raua Kao looms up, is generally low, but 
extremely rocky. The northwestern, northern, northeastern, and east- 
ern coasts are a succession of black, frowning, precipitous, basalt cliffs, 
worn into innumerable caves by the erosion of the sea, and with huge 
attached bowlders scattered at the base, over and against which the 
waves dash with resistless fury, forming a veritable iron-bound coast. 
Many of the caves thus formed have been inhabited and have also been 
used as burial places ; and the remains of human beings, with imple- 
ments interred with them or secreted by the modern natives, sometimes 
reward the diligent searcher. 

There are but two or three points around the entire coast line at 
which a sandy beach may be met with. One of these, small in extent, 
is on the south side, near Mr. Salmon's residence at Vaihu, in a pictur- 
esque little bay, used as a bathing ground aud boat landing. 

Another, and much the larger, forms the beach of Anakana Bay on 
the north side of the island, the legendary landing place of Hotu 
Metua, and by far the best and safest boat harbor around the coast. 

The soil is for the most part decomposed or disintegrated lava, 
nowhere of any great depth, but exceedingly fertile and in places, as 
for example, where excavations were made inside of cairns, it was 
found of the fineness, color and richness of garden mold. 

Except where a few clearings have been made, nearly the entire sur- 
face of the island is covered in astonishing profusion with fragments 
of lava, varying in size from that of a pebble to that of a huge 
bowlder. They are nearly black in color, hard, sharp, angular, weather- 
worn; and it is these, in places coverinr/ the ground, which render 
pedestrianism so difficult and laborious. 

Until supi^lied with wood from wrecked lumber vessels the modern

natives built many of these huts, the cairns for the dead, and other 
buildings, of these hiva blocks, loosely piled uj), and Messrs. Salmon 
and Brander apply them to good use in constructing their extensive 
corrals and fences, with the added advantage of thus clearing the soil 
for planting, wherever desirable. 

A coarse hummock grass and a variety of liner quality grow pro- 
fusely over nearly the entire island, sprouting vigorously among the 
lava fragments, and affording abundant i^asturage for the herds of 
cattle, horses, and sheep, the former numbering 600 and the latter 
18,000 at the time of our visit, and both multiplying rapidly. 

On the northeastern end of the island, and on the slopes of Mount 
Pua-ko taki, the surface is covered with fine, red, volcanic sand and 
dust, which is kept iu constant motion by the winds, and is barren of 
vegetation of any kind. 

At the time of our visit, December, which is during their dry or 
summer season, extending from October to April, the periods of the 
southeast trades, there were no running streams on the island, nor, 
with the exception of the valley at the base of Rana Kao, were there 
any evidences of the former existence of such visible. Fresh water 
away from the habitations was exceedingly scarce and difficult to 
obtain, although showers of rain at night were not infrequent. 

The alleged springs or wells, including Funa Pua, the " Unfailing 
Spring," so highly spoken of by former visitors, were at long distances 
apart, were merely shallow excavations among the bowlders into which 
the surface water percolated, and were covered to protect them from 
the animals. The water contained in them was rarely of more than 
a few bucketsful in quantity, and with a single exception, at Camp 
Whitney, of bad quality. That contained in the lakes inside the two 
craters, the accumulations of the rainy seasons, and surface drainage 
also, was fully as bad, and impregnated both with vegetable and animal 
matter, the former from the dense growth on the surface, the latter 
from the herds of cattle which came to the lakes to drink. 

It may be mentioned in this place that the natives, from long habit, 
no doubt, have become accustomed to drink but sparingly. We were 
surprised, during our expedition around the island, to notice how rarely 
they resorted to the canteen, with which all were x>i'Ovided, and they, 
no doubt, were equally amazed at our constant demand for water, made 
necessary to replace the loss from perspiration, induced by violent exer- 
cise and the sun's heat. They were always careful to locate our camp 
near, and anxious to keep us well supplied with, as good water as was 
to be had, and when we broke camp in the morning the "springs" in 
the vicinity were usually drained dry. 

It was at first a mystery to us whence the animals obtained their 
supplies, but as to the cattle, they never wandered far away from the 
craters, in whose lakes they could, at all seasons, quench their thirst. 
In so far as the sheep were concerned, whose needs in this respect are

uot great, no doubt the iiiglit dews, wbieli are quite lieavy ou Kapa 
Nui, aud with which the grass is loaded in the moruiugs, ami)ly sui)ply 
all their requirements in this respect. 

At the habitations, the rain falling on the roofs of the houses was col- 
lected in iron tanks, and the water thus obtained was unexceptionable. 
During the winter season, April to October, when the winds are variable, 
there is ample rainfall, and fresh water is abundant. 

Having no knowledge of the potter's art, earthen vessels are unknown, 
although red clay of tine quality is plentiful on the island. Neither 
does the cocoanut x)alm, so indispensable to the natives throughout 
Polynesia, grow upou the island, at the present day at least. A variety 
of gourd flourishes luxuriantly, however, and the fruit of this, properly 
seasoned, furnishes them with vessels for holding their water. 

The flora of the island is a very meager one. Tradition has it that 
it was barren until King Hoto Metua, the " Prolific Father," with his 
Queen and followers, landed and took possession, bringing with them 
seeds and fruits. 

Except in the immediate vicinity of the houses occupied by Messrs. 
Salmon aud Brander, the island may be said to be treeless. In the places 
mentioned a few fig, acacia, paper mulberry, and other trees grew to a 
fairly good height. In other parts of the island may be seen, in places 
in considerable numbers, a hard-wood tree, more properly bush or 
brush, called by the natives toromiro. These must have flourished 
fairly well at one time, but are now all, or nearly all, dead and decaying 
by reason of being stripped of their bark by the flocks of sheep which 
roam at will all over the island. None of the trees are, perhaps, over 
10 feet in height, nor their trunks more than 2 or 3 inches in diameter. 
The wood is exceedingly hard and heavy, somewhat resembling our 
apple, and the natives used, and still use it, to this day in making their 
house Gods, their Penates. These are rudely carved out of the solid 
wood, hideous imitations of the nude human form, male or female; 2 to 
3 feet in length, with preposterous development of chest and preternat- 
ural collapse of abdomen, as though famine had brooded over the laud 
aud the patient had perished of inanition ; with attenuated forms, long, 
slender arms and legs, narrow faces, a goatee, long, prominent cars, 
etc. In the eyes of these idols the iris is usually represented by a cir- 
cular button of bone, generally cut from a human skull, while a frag- 
ment of obsidian, fixed in a round hole in the center of this, aud which 
glistens in the light, makes a fair imitation of the pupil, both being 
deftly fitted in the wood of the ball. On the first occasion when the 
writer saw a skull from which several such buttons of bone had been 
removed for the purpose mentioned, he was impressed with the idea 
that the ancient Kapa Nuiis, like the ancient Peruvians in the time of 
the Incas, were acquainted with the operation of trephining and per- 
formed it in a much neater manner. Subsequent investigation speedily 
undeceived him on that point.

706 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 18P7. 

There are a few stunted trees and bushes growiog uear the water's 
edge, inside the great crater of Rana Kao. This remarkable volcano is 
1,327 feet high. The diameter of the crater at the top is 4,150 feet. At 
the water line inside it measures 2,085 feet across. The depth from the 
top to the lake is GOO feet, so that the surface of the latter is 727 feet 
above the sea level. The crater is nearly a perfect circle and unbroken 
at its upper edge, except at a point at its southern side, toward the 
ocean, where exists a large cleft or notch, through which, no doubt, the 
lava, when the volcano was active, found its way to the sea, and per- 
haps assisted in forming the small adjacent islands of Mutu Nui and 
Mutu Eaukau. It was to this latter island that thqir swimming matches 
■were annually held, in the eflbrt to see who should be the first to reach 
it, climb to the precipitous sides, and bring back one of the sacred eggs 
of the sea bird, to Avhich they attached such a superstitions value, and 
which conferred kingship for the year on the lucky captor for his 
prowess. This rock, covered with birdlime, looks at a little distance 
like a huge inverted stalactite projecting high in air from the depths 
of the sea. The labor and difficulty involved in mounting it, therefore, 
may be imagined. 

The interior of the crater (Rana Kao) is distinctly conical in shape, 
resembling a vast amphitheater, and presents a magnificent view. 
Trails lead to the bottom, in various directions, evidently the tracks 
worn by animals; but the descent, as well as the ascent, is most diffi- 
cult, and but very few ever attempt the feat. 

Grazing around the edge of the lake, as well as on the floor of vege- 
table matter floating on its surface, could be seen cattle which looked, 
at that dizzy height, of about the size of sheep, and sheep which ap- 
peared like rabbits. The lake at the bottom has been sounded by Mr. 
Salmon to a depth of 300 feet, when his line parted, without touching 
bottom. The surface edge is covered, over almost its entire extent, 
with a thick, dense, intertwined, vegetable growth, the accumulation 
of many years, from which grow small trees and bushes of considerable 
size. At various places, and few in number, over this floating, elastic, 
vegetable floor, which rises and falls as the water in the lake increases 
or diminishes in quantity, according as it is the rainy or dry season, are 
openings of variable size and irregular circular shape, through which 
the water appears, rippled by the passing winds, and to which the ani- 
mals resort to drink. Around these openings the vegetation is of a 
vivid green, evidencing present and vigorous growth, as well as grad- 
ual but steady encroachment on the small remaining free surface of the 
lake, so that in course of time it Avill no doubt become entirely cov- 
ered. Other portions of the vegetable mass are of a deeper shade of 
green, while still other and older parts are of varying tints of brown. 
Cattle and sheep may be seen browsing unconcernedly over various 
portions of th(» floating floor of vegetation, a curious and interesting 
(spectacle, and instinctively, perhaps, avoiding the treacherous places 



TE PITO TE HENUA OR EASTER ISLAND. 707 

likely to precipitate them into the depths below. A path of plauks has 
been laid to the edge of one of the openings, the more readily to enable 
the natives to obtain the water, which, as may well be inferred, is brack- 
ish and unpleasant to the taste and thoroughly impregnated with ani- 
mal and vegetable matter, vast masses of the latter being in a constant 
state of decay. 

The climate can scarcely be otherwise than salubrious and healthful. 
The southeast trades from October to Ainil blow fresh at the begin- 
ning and end of the season. During our stay in December they were 
moderately strong, and the weather continued exceedingly pleasant. 
For the remainder of the year the winds are uncertain, westerly pre- 
vailing perhaps; the weather is changeable, and there is abundance of 
rain. Electric storms are unknown. 

A psychrometrical record taken both on board ship, and to a very 
limited extent ashore, accompanies this report; as also a coj)y of the 
meteorological record from the ship's log during our stay at the island. 
In the latter the figures in the column *'wet bulb" are not entirely 
reliable, by reason of the inadequate nature of the cotton siphon, which 
consists merely of a few strands of ordinary lamp wick and does not 
cover the bulb. With the excei)tion of the two craters of Rana Kao and 
Eana Eoraka, the bottoms of which form lakes, as already stated, and 
which are isolated and far from the habitations, there is no decaying 
vegetable matter to be found worthy of note, and the island may there- 
fore be said to be free from malaria and the diseases of paludal origin. 
During the rainy season an occasional case of remittent appears, but it 
is of mild type; medication is not resorted to, and recovery takes place 
when dry weather sets in. So healthful is the climate, so simple are 
the habits of the people, and so isolated are they from contact with the 
outer world, and, consequently, the numberless malign influences which 
there hold sway, that diseases of any kind are very rare among the Eapa 
Nuiis, and they seem to be exempt from the ordinary ills of humanity. 
There are no " medicine men" among them, and they have no pharma- 
copoeia worthy the mention. 

During inclement weather a trifling "cough" — occasionally a case of 
pneumonia — a mild attack of rheumatism, may appear, and mention is 
also made of cerebral neuralgia. During our visit there was not, to 
the best of our knowledge, a case of acute disease on the island. 

It is stated that from May to October occasional cases of asthma show 
themselves, which the natives attribute to eating deep-water fish which 
have fed on a certain marine plant, the name of which the writer was 
unable to ascertain. This may be taken as delusion; and it maybe 
mentioned in this place that a well-marked case of asthma, in the per- 
son of one of the Mohican!'s firemen, was notably worse and suflered 
severely during the entire period of our stay at the island. 

A disease of the soles of the feet, which the natives called Mno, con- 
sisting, according to their statements, as understood, of fissures and ulcer- 



708 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

ations, was spoken of by them, and was attributed to walking barefoot 
over certain running vines usually growing among tlie rocks at the sea- 
side. On reaeliing such places they seemed to avoid them, but nothing 
definite or reliable was elicited, and subsequent inquiries were over- 
looked in the hurry of departure. 

VILLAGES AND HABITATIONS. 

The villages on the island are three in number, ITanga-roa, near the 
bay of the same name, on the western side; Mataveri, within a mile of 
the former, and Vaihu, near Cape Hoe-Hoe, on the southerly coast of the 
island. Much the larger part of the population is gathered in the two 
villages first mentioned, between which the people are about equally 
distributed. At the first named is the church of the Catholic mission. 

About a half mile south of Mataveri, near the base of Raua Kao, and 
separated from it by the most distinctive valley on the island, is the 
residence of Mr. Brander, the first erected and by far the largest, 
roomiest, and most convenient; modern-built, of wood, with lofty ceil- 
ings, and porches, and shade trees growing about it. It is, however, 
in a sad state of rei^air, and the evidences of neglect and thriftlessness 
are apparent everywhere. 

Vaihu, which can no longer be called a village, is about 4i miles to 
the eastward of Mataveri. It was at one time a Catholic mission, and 
the church and parsonage, still in a fair state of preservation, yet 
remain, together with a few outbuildings, all of which are occupied by 
Mr. Salmon and his employees, perhaps a dozen in all. Divine serv- 
ice, under the leadership) of native "missionaries," is still held in one 
portion of the church, while the remainder is appropriated to other 
purposes, mainly for the storage of wool, obtained from the sheep, con- 
siderable quantities of which are shipped to Tahiti. 

The habitations of the ancient image and platform builders, the 
stone huts on Raua Kao, will be described in other reports. 

Until quite recently the house of the modern Rapa Nuiis were some- 
what similar to those of the Fijians, being rectangular in shape, about 
C to 8 feet wide by 10 to 15 feet long, with nearly perpendicular sides, 
peak-roofed lengthwise, door on side, and thatched all over. 

A few years since an Oregon lumber vessel was wrecked on the island 
and much of her cargo, which consisted of boards, scantling, etc., was 
brought ashore. Of these, under suitable instruction, the natives built 
themselves houses, and nearly all are now domiciled in comparatively 
modern style habitations and far more comfortably than formerly. 
These houses, which after all have a very forlorn look, are from 15 to 20 
or more feet long by from 10 to 15 feet wide. The weatherboards are 
neatly fitted to the frame of scantling, and they are covered with a board 
roof There are usually two doors hinged opposite each other on the 
long sides of tlie house, and a small window or two close by the 
entrances, and sometimes glazed, admit a feeble light when the doors 
are closed. 



TE PITO TE HENUA OR EASTER ISLAND. 709 

In place of plank floors tlie bare earth is strewn with dried bnlnishes 
and ^rass to the de])th of several inches, and as this litter is rarely 
renewed, the rosnlt is obvions. Occasionally a bunk may be fonnd 
knocked nj) atone end of the single apartment of which the house con- 
sists, or, as in the more pretentious houses, a square bedstead may be 
seen, built of planed, unpainted wood, with a wild attempt at scroll 
carvinii- al)out the head and foot boards. Chairs and tables are 
unknown luxuries. 

The same house is often occupied by several families, or by several 
generations of the same family, but as the individuals composing these 
are never very numerous there is no overcrowding. 

A few of the more ordinary cooking utensils may occasionally be seen, 
but as a rule the natives, as is generally the case among the inhabitants 
of the South Sea Islands, j)repare their food in stone ovens in the fol- 
lowing manner: A circular excavation is made in the earth outside of 
the dwelling, several feet in diameter and a foot or two in depth, which 
is then neatly lined with a porous stone of some sort. Other stones are 
loosely laid in, and a quantity of dry wood or brush of any kind, with 
more stones, piled on. The wood is then set on fire, and, when the stones 
have become sufficiently heated, the loose ones are taken out, and the 
brands and cinders removed, leaving the lining of heated stones intact. 
Over these is then spread a layer of banana, breadfruit, or other large 
leaves to keep the food from contact with ashes. The food, taro, yams, 
sweet potatoes, fowl, short, or "long pig," or whatever else there may 
be, previously prepared for cooking, is then placed on the layer of leaves, 
piece by i:>iece, until all are in position, when the mound of food is care- 
fully covered over with several thicknesses of large green leaves to i)re- 
vent any dirt from falling in among the edibles. The heated stones, 
previously' removed, are then placed in jiosition all over the mass and • 
finally a thick layer of fine, dry earth, ashes, and cinders is ])iled over all, 
these being for the purpose of retaining the heat. In from two to three 
or four hours the baking is finished, and, barring the "long pig," per- 
haps, a more healthful and toothsome method of prei)aring and cooking 
food, when superintended by an expert native Samoau chef, for exam- 
ple, could not, in the estimation of the writer, who has had opportuni- 
ties for judging, be devised. The thought suggests itself here that the 
"clambakes" of our Atlantic States are a feeble imitation of this style 
of cooking among the islanders. 

As wood or solid fuel of any kind is a most rare commodity on Rapa 
Nui the natives are compelled to use brush, twigs, and trash (;ast up on 
their island by the sea, anything, in fact, of an inflammable nature which 
they can pick up. They even economize the dried droppings of the 
cattle, as the Arab does those of his camel, for this purpose, and I saw 
great basketfuls of these carefully stowed away in their houses for 
future use. 

They have no fixed time for eating, and while their menu, as may be 



710 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

iuferred from tlie statements contained in these pages, is never an 
elaborate one, it may readily be seen tliat they never safter for lack of 
food of some sort, the ju-incipal items being sngar cane, taro, and sweet 
potatoes. Then, too, they are not heavy eaters, and gluttony with its 
attendent corpulency, so common in some of the other islands, is quite 
unknown here. 

There are no fences or inclosures of any sort about their houses, 
which stand in the open field, with the grass growing to the doors, and 
nothing of an ottensive nature was observable in the vicinity. 

POPULATION, MANNERS, AND CUSTOMS. 

It is difficult to obtain accurate information regarding the population 
of the island prior to the year 1860. That a numerous people must 
have existed here during the days of the image builders seems to be 
well attested by the works they have left behind them; the multitudes 
of colossal stone images and crowns; the numbers and vast size of the 
platforms on which these stood; the great paved areas beside them, 
which afforded room for large assemblages ; the masses of foundation 
stones scattered over the island, many of which, still in position, show 
the strange shapes given to the houses which were erected upon them, 
and even admitting that these antiquities, and the work of fashioning 
them, covers a period of many years, the fact remains, nevertheless, 
that the immense labor involved, aided merely by the rude stone imple- 
ments, which alone they were known to possess, must have necessitated 
the employmentof a vastnumber of laborers. These, with their families, 
those engaged in the cultivation of the soil, in fishing and otherwise 
providing food, the aged and infirm, and those employed in other pur- 
suits, must have made uj) an aggregate much larger than would at first 
sight appear. 

With reference to the length of time covered by these works, it would 
seem, from the large number of images still to be seen on Rana Eoraka, 
both inside the crater and on its outer slope — some finished, others only 
partly so, and others still in the quarries — that there was a large amount 
of work in jirocess of execution at the same moment, and that, judging 
from the condition in Avhich it was found, some sudden calamity must 
have overtaken the workmen, causing all labor to cease abruptly. 

Indeed in respect to the astonishing number of volcanic stones so 
evenly scattered over the surface of the island, especially on the eastern 
half, it does not seem reasonable to suppose that they were there when 
the place was densely populated, of which latter circumstance there 
can scarcely be a doubt. This remark applies with especial force to 
the great plain at the foot and to the westward of Rana Roraka, where 
a large town is supposed to have existed, inhabited in part, it may be 
presumed, by the great numbers of workmen emploj^ed in the quarries 
of that mountain. Admitting this to be true and associating this with 
the fact that large numbers of the images seen in this vicinity are in 



TE PITO TE HEXUA OR EASTER ISLAND. 711 

ail unfinished condition ; tliat many more are to be found in the quarries, 
both inside the crater and on its outer slope, in all stages of develop- 
ment: and inferring; from this that the workmen suddenly ceased their 
labors, the thouj>ht readily suggests itself, in explanation of the mys- 
tery, that either Kana Ivoraka or one of the neighboring volcanoes 
suddenly entered into a state of activity, threw out these showers of 
stones and, jji-obably destroying many lives, stopped the labors of the 
workmen, which were thenceforth never resumed. Perhaps, too, the 
same calamity overthrew many of the idols, of which not one is now 
standing on its pedestal, laid waste the island, and wrought the 
destruction of the trees which once adorned it, and from the period of 
the occurrence of that disaster, the time of which can only be remotely 
guessed at, dates the decadence of the ancient people of Te Pito te 
henua. 

The soil of the island is very rich and productive, scant and unprom- 
ising as it may appear in many places, and with proper clearing and 
cultivation, and the planting of the appropriate varieties of food, such 
as could be stored for consumption during the dry season, supple- 
mented by the sustenance to be derived from the supplies of fish taken, 
with which the waters abound, a very large population might, no 
doubt, be maintained. 

As to the supply of water requisite for such a number of i^eoplej 
objection on that ground is not insuperable. Diligent search was made 
by the writer for the remains of cisterns, or any other evidences which 
they might have left of having had reservoirs for the storage of the 
Iirecious fluid. ^NTone such were to be seen anywhere, and yet they 
might have possessed them, but of so perishable a character that all 
traces have long since been obliterated. It seems certain that they 
had no knowledge of any cement; it is not likely, therefore, that their 
reservoirs would have been built of stone. Then, too, there remains 
the fact of the immense bodies of water stored mi these natural cisterns, 
the craters, particularly of Rana Kao. Here is a volume of water, at 
the present time at least 300 feet in depth, with a circumference at the 
surface of 2^ miles, and, if the parts of the crater visible above the 
water line be extended downward, probably conical in shape. A 
moment's consideration will show that here is a supply of water suffi- 
cient for an almost unlimited number of beings for an indefinite period. 
It may easily be imagined, also, that measures were most likely taken 
to maintain its purity, and that a people as intelligent as they appear 
to have been had some device for obviating the labor of transportation 
to the top of the crater. 

From what has been said it would appear that, even at the present 
day, the physical characteristics and natural conditions governing the 
island are not incompatible with the existence and well-being of a 
large population. I was not surprised, therefore, when Mr. Salmon 
informed me that from 1850 to 1800 the number of inhabitants was 



712 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

estimated nt 20,000, altliougli other calculations give much smaller 
figures. I am of the opinion that in the days of the image and plat- 
form builders the population might have been even larger. 

About the year 18C3 the Peruvians carried oft" from the island in 
15 vessels, as it is alleged, 5,000 of the inhabitants as agricultural 
laborers in Peru and to work the guano dei)Osits of the (Jhincha 
Islands. By reason of the odium attached to this proceeding, the 
Peruvian Government, some time afterwards, was induced to return 
those who had not succumbed to their treatment and altered conditions 
of life. SnuUlpox broke out among these on the return voyage. It is 
stated that all except two died, and the disease, spreading among the 
people ashore, ravaged the island, many deaths resulting. Of those 
carried off by the Peruvians one old man, Pakomeo, who was taken 
to the Chinchas, and whom we saw, still survives, the last of the 
unfortunates. 

Down to the year 1864 cannibalism is said to have been practiced 
by the natives. In that year a Jesuit mission was established on the 
island, at which time the population numbered about 1,500. Through 
the influence and teachings of the missionaries an almost radical 
change was Avrought in the manners, habits, and character of the 
people, and, to a certain extent at least, they adopted the customs of 
civilized life. 

When H. M. S. Topaze visited the island in 1868 there were but 
about 900 natives left, of whom less than 300 were females, with the 
numbers still rapidly declining, the proportion of deaths to births 
being given as 3 to 1. About the year 1875 some 500 were removed to 
Tahiti under contract to work on the sugar plantations of that island. 

In the year 1878 the missionaries, who had done admirable work 
among them, departed from the island, taking with them about 300 of 
the people, who settled Gambler Archipelago. 

When H. M. S. Sapplio touched at the island in 1882 it was reported 
that but 150 of the inhabitants were left. 

On the occasion of the Moliicavi's visit I received from Mr. Salmon, 
who had a complete census, with the names of every man, woman, and 
child on the island, the following summary: 

Natives 15.5 

Foreigners 11 

Total number of inhabitants 166 

Native men 68 

Native women 43 

Boys under l."> years of age 17 

Girls under 1.5 years of age 27 

Total number of natives 155 

Taliitians 6 

English 2 

Americans 2 

Frenchmen 1 

Total number of foreigners 11 



TE PITO TE HENUA OU EASTER ISLAND. 713 

It will be seeu from the above that, at the present time, among the 
children there is a preponderance of girls. The population is now 
reported at a standstill, the deaths and births about equaling- each 
other in point of numbers. The average number of children to a 
family is given as three. 

The age of puberty may be placed at 15 years in the male and lo 
years in the female. 

In color they are of a light brown, approaching here our lighter 
mulattos, the parts (face, neck, hands, etc.) exposed to the weather 
being always somewhat darker. 

They have fine, jet-black hair, which may be wavy or straight (never 
"kinky"), and which is worn in variable styles, according to the taste 
of the owner, usually short among the men, and in plaits, down the 
back, among the women. They never decolorize it with lime nor trim 
it in any fanciful manner, as is the case in the Samoan Group and other 
South Sea islands. The beards of the men, which are never very heavy, 
correspond in these respects with the hair. There are several venera- 
ble looking gray-haired and gray-bearded old men among them. I 
saw no bald-headed ones, with a single exce])tion. This was in the case 
of an old man who had been a cannibal, and, curiously enough, for gen- 
erally throughout the islands they are very reticent on this subject, 
boasted of the number of human beings off whose flesh he had made a 
savory meal. When asked how he liked "long pig" he smacked his 
lips and expressed a regret that he could no longer enjoy the luxury. 
His expression and appearance were in keeping with his hideous appe- 
tite, for a more villainous-looking knave does not exist on the island. 

The Eapa I^uiis may be considered a long-lived people. The oldest 
man and chief on the island, Mati by name, the j)atriarch of the Kapa 
Nuiis, does not know his actual age, but is certainly over 90 years old, 
and his wife, Maakua, of whom a photograph was taken, bears him 
close company in that as well as in other respects. The last king of 
the Kapa Nuiis, Maurata, also called Kaimokoe, was captured by the 
Peruvians, carried to the Chincha Islands, and died in 1864. His near- 
est descendant and successor, a nephew named Kaitae, is 79 years 
old. The last survivor of Peruvian captivity, Pakomeo, who was also 
photographed, must nuuiber at least the Biblical threescore and ten. 
These, with a few others not mentioned, may be considered a remarka- 
ble showing among so small a number of people, and proves not only 
that the original stock must have been a good one, but that their climate, 
surroundings, and mode of life were promotive of longevity. 

In stature they are not a large race. There are a few, mainly among the 
older men, who are tall, erect, straight, spare in build, G feet or there- 
abouts in height, but the remainder, including the women, are smaller, 
and they may be classed as a small-boned, medium-sized people. They 
are not robust, apparently, neither are they very muscular 5 on the con- 
trary, most of them present rather a slight, delicate, feeble appearance, 



714 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

which is, however, misleading. They are wiry, lithe, strong, active, tire- 
less on the march, capable of carrying heavy bnrdens long distances, 
indifferent to weariness, and seemingly equal to any amount of effort 
they might be induced to make. We saw this frequently exemplified 
on our tramp around the island, when, after a weary day's march, we 
would come into tbe camp foot-sore and tired, while they, fresh and 
active apparently, would go to work catching and dressing sheep, build- 
ing tires, etc. If we complained that the water was " vai kava," bitter, 
they would endeavor to explain where better could be found and imme- 
diately start off, with bucket and canteen, on a tramp of a mile or two 
over the plain, or down into a crater, in order to bring us "vai maitai," 
good water. 

These people proudly claim direct descent from the image and plat- 
form builders. It is not the writer's province to discuss this point, 
although strong arguments might be adduced to demonstrate the con- 
trary. Be that as it may, it is very evident to the most casual observer 
either that the modern Rapa Nuiis belong, whether wholly or, which is 
more probable, in part, to a different race or that they are the "degener- 
ate sons of worthy sires." 

The color of their eyes is dark brown, with black brows and lashes, 
neither very heavy. Their expression of countenance is pleasing, mild, 
frank, modest, intelligent, and somewhat sad. They are slender but 
well formed, clean of limb, and the various parts of the body are well 
proportioned to each other. Their foreheads, while not very broad, are 
of good height and but slightly receding, which is also true of the facial 
angle generally. The head is well balanced and cheek bones are uota-. 
])ly prominent. Their nose is quite straight and well shaped, with no 
marked spreading of the alae; mouths of moderate size and usually 
filled with excellent teeth, which, when the jaws are closed, come 
squarely into ap[)Osition; lips rather thin; hands and feet small. It 
may be mentioned that they attribute the beautiful appearance and 
excellent condition of their teeth to the chewing of sugar cane, large 
quantities of which they consume as food. There is nothing savage or 
repulsive looking about them, and some of their young women are 
decidedly comely and attractive. While in their habitations the evi- 
dences of good housewifery are nearly nil, they are quite cleanly in 
their personal habits and there is no unpleasant odor noticeable about 
their bodies. They all dress in European costume. They are a bright, 
intelligent, quickwitted people, of rather a nervous temperament; 
tractable and gentle in disposition, decidedly sympathetic and tender- 
hearted and markedly emotional in their natures, so that they are 
easily moved either to tears or laughter. In evidence of the latter 
trait in their character one or two instances may be adduced. 

When the Catholic mission was first established on the island Chief 
Mati took a great liking to the reverend father in charge, evinced the 
greatest affection for him, and finally adopted him as his son. Such 



TE PITO TE HENUA OR EASTER ISLAND. 715 

being the case, it may readily be conceived that wlicii the mission was 
removed from the island and the father was compelled to bid farewell 
to his simple-minded, but loving- and faithful, Kapa Nui friend the part- 
ing must have been a sad and ])ainful one. In the ten years which have 
elapsed since that time Chief Mati has never forgotten his well-beloved 
son, the priest, and whenever, which is only at very long intervals, a 
white man arrives at the island Mati's first thought is to inquire the 
tidings of his far-away friend. On the first occasion when my associate, 
Dr. Whitaker, in company with Mr. Salmon, who had previously advised 
the doctor on the subject, called on ^Nlati, the latter, now over fourscore 
and ten, confident that the doctor came from the priest's country and 
must necessarily know him, immediately began to inquire regarding 
him; if he was well and happy; if he still loved and remembered him. 
When the doctor, in order to humor and gratify the old man, wove a 
harmless and ingenious, but fictitious, narrative about the priest, iu 
which he highly commended Mati, the latter groaned dismally, con- 
torted his face, and wept like a child. Seeing this, his poor old wife 
approached her husband, laid her arm on his shoulder, looked up in his 
face a moment, and then, after a series of mournful grimaces, bowed her 
head on her arm and, in the abandon of grief, groaned and cried aloud. 
Then everyone among the Kapa Nuiis present, taking the cue from the 
old lady, lifted up their voices in chorus and for a time it fairly rained 
salt tears. The groans were dismal and the cries pitiful, so that the 
most callous might easily have been moved to compassion. 

On another occasion the doctor was asked to see a little girl who was 
suflering with a cervical abscess. The usual crowd of men, women, 
and children was present. Had the doctor informed them iu advance 
of what he intended doing they never would have consented to the pro- 
ceeding. Quietly seating liimself, he gently and unconcernedly drew 
the child toward him and, placing her head between his knees, drew 
from his pocket an abscess knife. That started the concert. The miu- 
nte they saw it, ami divined that he was going to cut the child, groans 
and lamentations and expressions of sympathy for the little one could 
be heard on all sides. Quickly incising the abscess the puss spurted 
and ran in a stream, whereupon the audience howled with renewed 
energy, curiosity having produced a tem])orary lull, and for a time the 
situation was interesting and entertaining to a degree. The child, who 
had scarcely felt the blade, and scared by the din about her, must 
needs pipe her little tune and join with the others. As soon as they 
saw that the child had not been harmed and understood the object of 
the apparent cruelty their demonstrations were just as pronounced in 
the other direction and they manifested their delight and gratification 
in expressions of joy, and peals of hysterical laughter, and were i)re- 
pared to mount the doctor on a platform, so to speak, then and there. 

As with a^ll the natives throughout the South Sea islands, the Rapa 
Nui is undeniably, and very decidedly, averse to hard work. He delights 



716 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

to lie around aud gossip, to smoke, to sit and " moon " over the industry, 
the greatness, and the monuments of liis ancestors, the degeneracy and 
decadence of his race, perhaps, and his own utter and ineradicable 
worthlessness individually. Natural covetousness and desire for the 
possession of lucre may tempt him to serve the white man for a time, 
but he soon tires of his work, which speedily becomes irksome to him. 
And whilehe mayexertliimself a tritie occasionally, in theway of fishing, 
or in the cultivation of an 8 bj^ 10 patch of sugar cane, taro, and sweet 
potato, it is only as a matter of necessity, to keep body and soul together, 
and he infinitely prefers idleness and the enjoyment of his dolce far 
niente. 

Intoxicating drinks of any descriiition, even kava, so common in the 
islands to tbe westward, are unknown to these people, and neither do 
Mr. Salmon, or the other foreign residents, keep any liquors in their 
possession. While, therefore, it is true that here, as elsewhere among 
uncivilized peoples, contact with the European has been attended by 
their gradual extinction, it can not be said that all the usual factors 
obtain in this instance, since neither the venereal poison nor intoxicants 
exist on the island. Consequently, these can not be assigned as causes 
of the decadence of the Eai)a Nuiis. Deportation, forced and voluntary, 
smallpox, and customs, elsewhere mentioned in this paper, will explain 
their gradual extinction, in part, at least, while the fact remains that 
their seemingly inevitable destiny was vastly accelerated when the 
white man set foot upon their mysterious, mid-ocean island. 

The rite of circumcision, so common in the other islands, is unknown 
here, nor does their language possess an equivalent word. 

As may be inferred from the i)reponderance of the male over the 
female portion of the community the latter are in demand, and the sup- 
ply not being equal to it, the women are a source of great solicitude ; much 
consideration is shown thein ; they are fairly well taken care of, and 
are treated, generally, with kindness, not to say atiection. Polygamy, 
under the circumstances, does not, of course, exist and celibacy, it may 
be said, only from necessity, since there are not enough females. 

While it can not be truthfully claimed that polyandry, in the strict 
acceptation of the term, obtains among them, they have a custom which 
very nearly approaches that practice, as will appear presently. 

At the present day the ceremonies of the church, measurablj^ at 
least, govern their marriages; nevertheless the ancient custom still 
prevails, to a considerable extent, and in a few words it is this: When 
a boy arrives at the age of, say 12 years, his father looks about him for 
a suitable life- companion, of the opposite sex, for the young hopeful. 
Having discovered one to his liking the father proceeds to interview 
the parents of the damsel, who is perhaps of the same age, or more 
likely younger than her prospective lord, declares his intentions matri- 
monial and negotiations are then entered into. After a due amount of 
haggling as to the value of the girl, during which the parents of the 



TE PITO TE HENUA OR EASTER ISLAND. 717 

latter endeavor to "bull" the market, while those of the boy do their 
utmost to "bear" the commodity under appraisement, the price is finallj'^ 
agreed upon and the bargain is concluded, the consideration being a 
specified quantity of sugar cane, taro, sweet potatoes, chickens, etc., to 
be paid the girl's iiarents. A day is then tixed upon; relatives and 
friends are notified; due j)reparations are made at the girl's house, to 
Avhich the articles mentioned have meanwhile been sent, and at the 
time ai)poiuted, all interested being present, a grand feast is held, at 
which, as a rule, everything edible, that is to say the price of the girl, 
is consumed. That important business being finished, bride and groom 
retire to the residence of the parents of the latter, by whom the bride 
is adopted as their own child, and thenceforth the parties are husband 
and wife. 

The cares and the obligations of matrimony, as well as of parentage, 
sit lightly upon the Rapa Nuiis. Although marital infidelity may be 
rare, it is stated that a husband will, in consideration of a certain 
quantity of produce, make over all right in his wife to another for a 
specified period, at the exijiration of which time he will take back the 
wife and she again becomes the partner of his joys and sorrows. This 
might be called polygamy in another form. 

Fixing the average at three gives, I think, a very fair estimate of 
the number of children to Sf family, and the lack of fecundity among 
them will readily be exi)lained by the early child marriages, customs, 
habits of life, intermarriage, and the degeneracy of the race. 

In these people the lower part of the body and extremities were 
found well developed, and in the women more so than would be sup- 
posed from their slight physique. In the latter the skin was lighter 
in color in the unexposed than in the exposed parts. The hips are 
broad and full, the thighs large, round, and firm, and legs straight and 
tapering to the ankles, which, with the feet, were small and delicate. 
They are but sparingly hirsute. The breasts of those examined were 
moderately large, full, round, firm, and carried well up on the chest. 
The nipples were quite small, but with good-sized areola, which latter 
presented, in some instances, that peculiar puffy, translucent appear- 
ance, as though filled with serum, often seen throughout the other Pacific 
Islands. The Kapa Xuiis differed from these in that the areola was not 
so large nor of so deep a tint, the writer having seen them in other 
islands covering half the breast and nearly black in color. 

The skin of the woman examined, where not covered with tattooing, 
was nearly as light in color as that of the average brunette, and very 
fine, smooth, soft, and delicate. 

There seems to be no doubt that, with all their apparent mildness and 
good nature, the baser i)assions and savage instincts of these people 
are strong within them, and instances of inhumanity occasionally crop 
out among them. A case which came under the notice of Br. Whitaker 
was that of a woman who was suffering from spinal deformity, the result 



718 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

of injuries inflicted by lier husband in a moment of blind rage over some 
grievance, fancied or real. In this connection it may be mentioned that 
subsecjuently this same woman went to nurse Pakomeo, previously men- 
tioned, who was ill at the time. Upon the recovery, so well pleased 
were they with each other that she abandoned her cruel spouse, remained 
with Pakomeo, was living with him as his wife at the time of our visit, 
and the arrangement seemed mutually satisfactory. 

The custom of tattooing has fallen off within the last few years and is 
now rarely or never practiced. It is only among the adults, more cspe- 
ciallj' among the older people, that good examples may be found. Unless 
the inhabitants of other islands, where a standard pattern is adhered 
to, the Kapa Nniis seem to have affected no uniform fashion nor limited 
themselves to any particular style. The custom obtained alike among 
the male and female members of the community. Generally speaking, 
the ornamentation was as follows: A narrow band around the upper 
l)art of the forehead, at the edge of the roots of the hair, with little 
balls, each joined to the band by a stem, pendant from it, the whole 
simulating a coronet; a line around the outer free edge, the helix, and 
lobe of the ear; aline around the edge of the lips; the neck in its 
entire circumference, either in straight lines, vertical or oblique, or with 
the lines wavy; three radiating exclamation marks beneath each ear, 
common among women at the present day; a girdle about the waist, 
in broad bands, with an attempt at lacte work, or fringe, from which rise 
heavy lines, at the ends of which, toward the axilbie, are fanciful figures 
resembling faces, with a larger face in the middle of the back; fine lines 
down the thighs anteriorly; heavy, undulating bands posteriorly, run- 
ning over the buttocks toward the waist; wavy or straight perpendicular 
lines, terminating in points, around the legs, and elsewhere. 

The material used in tattooing is madeof the soot obtained by burning 
a plant with a leaf similar to our Indian corn, and called by the natives 
ti, moistened with the expressed juice of a berry similar to our poke- 
berry, and called poporo. Pieces of bone, finished like a fine-toothed 
comb, or fish bones made fast to a short stick, are used to prick the skin 
by holding in contact with the surface and striking it a brisk blow. 

Before the advent of the missionaries the Eapa ISTuiis possessed scant 
wardrobes. They made a coarse cloth woven of the fibers of the inner 
bark of the mahKti, Chinese i)aper mulberry, or of the hiirav, another 
fibrous tree, which they wore about the shoulders and loins. This cloth 
was also used, in the manner of a shield, as a protection in battle against 
the ejiemy's spears, which latter was, with the exception of the war club, 
their principal weapon, the head being made of obsidian, numbers of 
which may be found on the island. Tliey also made siapu, or tapa, as 
do the natives of other islands, by beating out the bark and wearing 
the same as a breechcloth. With the coming of the missionaries civi- 
lized clothing was introduced and is now generally worn,comprising coat, 
shirt and trousers, among the men, and a loose gown of cotton mate-

rial, printed or plain, for the women. Shoes are worn on only special 
occasions of ceremony, as, for example, during our visit. On their heads 
both sexes alike wear hats, the material of which is either bulrushes or 
long, slender leaves, torn into narrow strips, braided aod then sewn 
together spirally. In making these they are far behind other islanders, 
the Tahitians more especially, attributable mainly, however, to the want 
of prowler material rather than to the lat^k of intelligence. 

Crimes of any sort, but especially the graver ones, are of great 
rarity, and murder, at the present day, unknown. Petty thieving is 
common, is considered a venial ofl'ense, and the injured party seeks 
redress by stealing in kind, if possible, but in any event, stealing from 
the thief. There are no punishments, so called. Mr. Salmon, who is 
guide, ijhilosopher, and friend to these peopie, unites in his person (and 
being a giant in stature, he can well contain them) the duties of referee, 
arbiter, judge. They entertain the greatest respect for him; evince 
the utmost affection j look up to him as their master; go to him with 
all their troubles; refer to him all their disputes and grievances. His 
word is law, and his decisions final and undisputed. 

There is a schoolhouse in which the people are taught from books 
translated into Eapa Nui language by the priests formerly here, and 
most of the natives can read and write. The functions of pedagogue 
are i^erformed, after a fashion, by Pakomeo, the survivor of the Peruvian 
captives, who is also a preacher among them and conducts the services 
at the little church. The form of salutation on meeting is kohomai, 
" come to me." The reply, koe, which means '^ thou," you, yourself. 
In Tahiti, Society Islands, and Karotonga it is, la-ora-na, " may you 
live in God." In the Samoau group, kalofa, " love to you" and tofa, 
"may you sleep." 

With regard to the burial rites, it may be stated that no particular 
resi^ectis showu persons of rank while living; still less do they receive 
any special funeral ceremonies when dead. All are treated alike in this 
regard, on the principle, jiresumably, that death levels all. The period 
of mourning extends over three days, and the rites are simple enough. 
Nowadays the service of the church is usually invoked. The body is 
carried out of the house and removed to some distance, either in the 
open plain, or to one of the image platforms, or into a cave, where it is 
exposed to sun and air (incidentally, it may be mentioned, also to 
predatory rats and cats in a semiwild state, which roam the island in 
large numbers, the former especially) until either dry, decomposed, or 
partially devoured. In the caves the remains are then shoved into an 
out-of-the-way corner and walled in with loose stones. At the platforms 
they may be laid away under a gigantic i)rostrate stone image, or placed 
in an excavation, either in the face or floor of the platform, or simply 
put in a convenient spot and covered up with stones. On the plains a 
circular conical cairn, truncated at top, 6 to 8 feet high, and built of 
loose bowlders, is frequently erected over the remains. Often the bones 



720 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

of several individuals may be found in one receptacle, and at one of the 
platforms a collection of skulls alone was discovered in a sepulcher 
which was oijened. 

The rats, which by reason of the loose manner of interment have free 
access to the remains, no doubt perform an imi)ortant office as scav- 
engers in disposing of the soft parts, since in no single instance were 
any bones found, either human or sheep — and the skeletons of both were 
frequently fallen in with — which were not completely denuded, and the 
fine litter, which was almost invariably found in the cranial cavity, 
showed where the rodents had been nest-hiding. 

The food of the Hapa ]SIuiis comprises the following principal articles: 
Sugar cane, taro, sweet potatoes, bananas, fowl, shell and other fish in 
large quantities, tomatoes, pumpkins, figs, pigs, and rarely sheep and 
cattle. 

Their manner of cultivating the soil is of the simplest descrii^tion. 
Owing to the depredations of the numberless sheep and cattle, they are 
compelled to keep all their cultivated patches carefully inclosed, and 
as there is no wood ou the island which can he applied to that purpose 
they are forced to use volcanic stones. Occasionally, therefore, one 
may see a wall about 2 feet thick by C or 8 feet high inclosing a plot 
of ground perhaps 50 feet square, in which will be found a variety of the 
plants above mentioned growing luxuriantly. 

The average Kapa Nuiis, however, perhaps wisely, ijrefers a fence 
ready made to building one himself, and therefore selects the standing 
stone walls of one or more of the old houses, which he appropriates to 
his purpose. There are many of these scattered over the island, par- 
ticularly^ on the eastern half. These require but little repair to put them 
in order and secure against the entrance of sheep, and, although small, 
they amply suffice to supply the needs of the native husbandmen. Of 
course there is no pretense of cultivation ; the ground is scratched; the 
article planted ; the rest is intrusted to the care of the omnipotent atua. 

The soil is rich, and ancient navigators report the island covered 
with vegetation, and yet one could not repress the feeling of suriirise, 
in view of the present unpromising appearance of the surface and 
unfavorable surroundings, on seeing how vigorously and luxuriantly 
everything grew within these inclosures.

THE MAN'S KNIFE AMONG THE NORTH AMERICAN IN- 
I)IAXS-A STUDY IN THE COLLECTIONS OF THE U. S. 
NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



By Otis Tufton IvrASON, 
Curator, JHrmon of Etlinolo<iii. 



INTRODUCTION. 

Among implements used by man, the same forms may sometimes be 
employed for destruction and at other times for industrial purposes. 
When used for destruction they are weapons, but when their function 
is industrial they are tools. The same object, when used as a weapon, 
becomes a dagger, but if it be employed as an edged tool it is a knife. 
As in the case of all other weapons or tools, the edged tool works by 
pressure, by friction, or by a blow. One used by means of a blow is an 
ax if the edge is in a line with the handle, and an adz if it lies across 
the handle; an edged tool working by friction is a scraper, but one 
working by j^ressure is a knife. 

It will be found iu the study of industrial knives that in the long run 
they become the carver's and engraver's tools, the drawing knife, the 
spokeshave, the plane, and the planiug mill. In some styles of the last 
named, however, the operative part of the machine is, more i^roperly 
speaking, a machine adz than a knife. Carving in wood and other sub- 
stances by the American aborigines differentiated the adz from the 
knife. It is probable that before the introduction of iron into America 
the adz was used more than the knife in dressing down wood; but 
when the iron blade came into vogue it was possible for the savage 
workman to carve out hollow dishes and boxes, and other objects with 
his knife by simple pressure. Kotable exceptions to this are those 
regions where soft wood came into alliance with sharks' teeth and the 
incisors of rodents. This is shown in all the curved knives of the 
collections in the U. S. National Museum from the two hemispheres, 

especially those from wooded areas.

728 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

IMPROVEMENT THROUGH THE CURVED KNIFE. 

There ought to be no doubt tliat iu every case where the savage was 
fortunate enough to obtain the knife his carving and whittling were 
better done. There is a marvelous difference between carving on the 
one hand, man's work chielly, and basketry or pottery on the other, con- 
servative woman's work. In no tribes were the two last-named arts 
bettered by contact with the higher race. The work Avas done with the 
hands almost wholly. The tools were of the simplest character. The 
harsh iron awl was not so good as the smooth pointed bone awl, of 
which hundreds have been found, and the pride in personal endeavor 
departed with the quenching of the tribal spirit. The potter's wheel, 
such as it was three centuries ago, was only a barrier to the unmechan- 
ical sex. Therefore those who constantly assert that prejudice made it 
impossible for the savage to better himself iu the adoption of the white 
man's devices catch only half a truth. 

CLASSIFICATION. 

In the class of cutting tools called knives, there nre iu the IT. S. 
National Museum, collected among the North American Indians, two 
series. One has been called the "woman's knife;" the other, therefore, 
may uow be denominated the "man's knife." ' 

Both of these series exist aboriginally in two subdivisions, the one 
containing no iron or evidences of the use of that metal, the other made 
partly of iron or with iron. In fact, there are four subdivisions of the 
term "industrial knife," namely, woman's knife, ancient; woman's knife, 
modern; man's knife, ancient; man's knife, modern. 

The man's knife of the modern type exists in three varieties, to wit, 
the "curved knife," with bent blade, em^jloyed usually in whittling; a 
second variety, named " straight blade," with a short straight cutting 
part used in carving stone, antler, ivory, and other hard substances; 
and a third variety, usually with an old knife blade or piece of file well 
worn down for its working part, employed in the function of a burin for 
scratching or etching on hard surfaces. The three varieties ueeessarily 
merge into one another, so that there are no broad dividing lines. 
The curved knife may now be carefully examined as a contribution to 
studying the man's knife of ancient type. 

PARTS OF THE CURVED KNIFE. 

Each variety of man's curved knife, as of other i)rimitive and mod- 
ern mechanics' tools, consists of three elements or i^arts, differing 
among the several tribes and from place to place in materials and 
forms, though the blades furnished by Europeans are of the same gen- 
eral motive. 

First, the whittling blade is usually of iron or steel, beveled on the 



» The Ulu, or Woman's Knife, Kept. U. S. Nat. Mns., 1890, pp. 411-416, plates 52-72. 



THE man's knife. 720 

upper side and plain on the under side, and more or less curved upward 
at the outer end. The blades of commerce are not greatly different 
in shape, but it will be seen that native ingenuity lias been able to 
fashion blades from any piece of iron. Murdoch, speak in <>• of Point Bar- 
row, says that "the carver's knife is not always carved in the blade.'" 

Those that are sold to the natives are mostly curved, and the han- 
dles are added afterwards. Example Cat. No. SOl'Di in the U. .S. 
National Museum from Point Barrow has a short, thick "jackknife" 
blade much worn down. It is hafted between two longitudinal sec- 
tions of reindeer antler held together by rivets, one section being cut 
out to receive the tang. Two rivets are of iron and three of brass. 

The tang of the blade, which exists as an element in the hafting, 
is usually a continuation thereof, without much finish, being a Hat 
rectangle in outline. The foim of the tang, however, will be governed 
by the method of its application to the handle, as will appear. It 
maybe, first, pointed and driven into the end of the handle; second, 
rectangular and laid between the halves of the handle; third, set into a 
narrow groove on top of the handle; fourth, laid in a shallow groove on 
the side of the handle; fifth, set in a saw cut in the end of the handle. 

Second, the handle or grip. This may be either of wood taken from 
the forest or from wreckage, or of bone or antlei-. The woman's knife, 
usually, has the grip attached to the back of the blade along its extent 
and the blade in position is under the grip. But in the man's knife the 
end of the blade forms the tang and the place of attachment for the 
handle, and therefore the gri^) is cylindrical or partly so. In point of 
fact the handle may be said to have three parts — the pommel or butt, 
quite frequently ornamented, even in tools of savages; the grip or 
portion actually in the hand, and the joint or hinge. The form of the 
grip may be that of the natural piece of material. Woman's knife 
handles are much more delicately fashioned to fit the fingers than are 
those of the man's knife. But in the curved type the thumb is espe- 
cially cared for, as giving leverage and guidance in whittling, and 
in some examples a long extension of the handle enables the whittler 
to call into activity every muscle of his forearm. The j)ortion of the 
handle and the treatment of it with reference to the bond or connection 
with the blade will be spoken of in the next paragraph. The modifica- 
tions of the handle for the insertion of the working part involve the 
selection of the grain, splitting one end, splitting the handle, drilling, 
grooving, sawing, socketing, etc. 

Third, the bond or " connect! ve" between the blade and the grip — that 
is, between the working part and the manual part. In the history of 
tools these connective devices have had an interesting elaboration. 
Practically, the bond between working part and manual part consists 
of three elements: First, a modification in the blade corresponding to 
the tang; second, a modification of the handle for the insertion of the 



John Murdoch, Ninth Annual Report of the Bureau ol" lOthiiology, p. 155,fig. 110. 



730 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

tang; and third, the true connective of packing, cement, lashing, rivets, 
wedges or screws, some of which appear in the illustrations of this 
paper. Where the tang is driven into the end of the grip the elasticity 
or cohesion of the material forms the bond. In many examples the 
principle of the ratchet and of the dovetail exist in the shaping of the 
tang and its socket or in cutting notches on the tang. 

Before the introduction of the Iron Age into North America there 
existed the same elements in the composition of a knife, to wit, a blade 
of tooth, or shell, or stone; a handle of antler, bone, or wood; and a 
connective of rawhide, sinew, yarn, or twine, of packing, of cement, and 
possibly of rivets made of wood, bone, ivory, or antler. 

MODE OF CUTTING. 

All primitive men's knives with single edge, so far as the national 
collections indicate, are made to cut toward the operator. Double- 
edged knives, however, cut both ways. Among the American examples 
all are for the right hand or for both hands. Lawson distinctly says 
that "when the Carolina Indians cut with a knife, the edge is toward 
them, whereas we always cut and whittle from ns; nor did I ever see 
one of them left-handed." ' The farrier, as will be seen, also cuts toward 
him, but by turning his hand under, in an awkward sort of way, 
occasionally cuts from him. Two curved knives in the U. S. National 
Museum from the Ainos of northern Japan, constructed exactly after 
the manner of the American curved knives, are made to lit the left 
hand, but they were received from the same person. It will be per- 
fectly plain to one who has sharpened a quill pen oi" lead pencil that, 
in the absence of spoke shaves and tine car\'er's tools, the Indian was 
comi^elled to cut toward his body. 

SOURCE OF CURVED KNIFE. 

This manner of working is, doubtless, a survival of old processes of 
hand work before the introduction of more modern tools. It may have 
been overlooked by the student of technology that it was not until 
recently that any care was bestowed upon fitting the handles of me- 
chanics' tools to the hand itself. In the case of the woman's knife it 
will be found that the farther away the Eskimo live from the white race 
the more simple tlie handle of the scraper, while in those areas where 
the contact has been most intimate the handle is more completely and 
perfectly made to conform to the right hand. 

Jt is astonishing that until Perry's visit to Japan the handles of all 
Japanese tools were extremely simple. There are some specimens of 
bronze implements found in Europe in which the handle conforms to the 
right hand of the worker. It is reasonably certain, therefore, that the 
man's knife and the farrier's knife have come down from a remote past 
in their present simple form.

THE man's knife. 731 

It is not disputed that amoug American Indians all of the iron-bladed 
knives for men are exotics, at least in the working part or blade. Eth- 
nographers will notice also that in the accnlturation of savages it is 
always the working part that they are willing to improve without 
prejudice. The manual part holds its own longer, and it will be seen 
that the grip and connective of men's knives are often "old school" 
while the blade is ''new school.*' 

An important cpiestion arises as to the date of introduction and the 
exact European source of some of the forms of blades. The only sur- 
vival in tlie United States of the curved blade is in the farrier's knife, 
with which he pares the hoof of the horse prior to laying on the shoe. 

After a diligent search among cutlers it is dififlcult to ascertain how 
long this form of knife has been in use among farriers, and what its 
l)recise relation is to the Xorth American curved knife. 

Murdoch draws attention to the fact that the Eskimo of Point Barrow 
call all knives savik, meaning also iron, the identical word used in 
Greenland for the same objects.' From this he argues that the first iron 
was obtained from the East, along with the soapstone lam])s instead 
of from Siberia, as was tobacco. It is true, however, that whittling 
with a curved knife having a thumb cavity prevails all over eastern 
Asia. The white migrants to Greenland antedated those to Alaska, 
nevertheless, by several centuries. It will be found, also, by examin- 
ing the Eskimo knives of Murdoch and Nelson, that they often differ 
radically from the Indian types here especially noted. Seldom does an 
Indian knife show the presence of the blacksmith, while the whale- 
shijj's blacksmith seems to have been a successful schoolmaster to the 
Eskimo. jMoreover, ivory, antler, and bone are far less tractable than 
birch saplings for whittling, or cedar for sha])ing, excavating, or 
carving. The Eskimo blade is shorter, straighter and never used with 
two hands, while the Indian knife is used for grooving and reducing 
large surfaces in the absence of the plane. 

Among North American aborigines the iron-bladed knife is restricted 
in its area to the Eskimo and the Indian tribes southward in Alaska, 
the Dominion of Canada, and the splint basket, snowshoe, the self-bow, 
and the birch-bark canoe area of the United States. Tlie last-named 
implements are jackknives par excellence. They are designed for whit 
tlingand i^roducing shavings, and not for chopping or scraping — that is, 
the formation of chips across the grain or of sawdust and scraps. These 
lines must not be too sharply drawn, however, inasmuch as this i^aper 
is restricted to materials furnished by the collections in Washington. 
It is wonderful how adept primitive artisans are in getting a variety of 
work out of one im])lement. In the absence of spokeshaves, planes, 
chisels, gouges, groove planes, small adzes, and a host of others, the 
Pacific coast Indians do the work of all with a double edged curved 
blade h inch wide and 3 inches long. 



'John Murdocli, Ninth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, p. 157. 



732 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

Witliiu the regions mentioned there is for the student an excellent 
opi)ortunity to study the effect, materials, and their environmental 
forces upon the construction of the knife. Two varieties of the man's 
knife are steadily used by the Eskimo — the carver's knife and the etching 
knife or burin; but, all other shapes are employed by them, so that one 
finds the curved knife for whittling, the straight blade for carving, and 
the pointed blade for etching. The blades are short and firmly attached 
to the handles by rivets or by lashing. The handles are usually of 
bone, antler, or ivory, some of them being curved to fit the forearm 
and give great purchase in cutting hard material; others are short and 
adapted to be grasped in the hand for the purpose of making small 
chips and even for scraping. 

The Canadian Indians and thoseof the northern United States, having 
only soft material and bark to work upon, restrict themselves mostly 
to the long-bladed curved knife. On the Pacific coast, among Indian 
tribes from Mount St. Elias and southward, there is a mixture of hard 
material and soft wood, so that there is a great variety in the form of the 
whittler's knife. Furthermore, these tribes have been in contact with 
sailors for more than a century and use any i)iece of steel or iron they 
can secure in trade. The Canadian Indians were stimulated by the 
fur-trading companies to travel more rapidly and to make longer jour- 
neys; hence, in furnishing them with the curved knife, they made it 
possible for these Indians to work out the frame of the l)irch-bark canoe, 
the bows of the snowshoes, splints for basketry, and a thousand and 
one objects made of birch bark, with this simple but most efficient 
device. It has become the traveling tool of the Canadian Indians and 
has done more than aught else to imj)rove their mechanical skill. An 
examination of old patterns of snowshoes, in comparison with the latest 
patterns, reveals an astonishing improvement. The versatile curved 
knife is just as useful in the making of fine babiche or rawhide string 
for the webbing of the snowshoe as in whittling down the frame. In 
the old-fashioned snowshoes the rawhide footing is nearly one-fourth 
inch wide, while in the best and latest the strands are as fine as thread. 

EXAMPLES. 

Example Cat. ^o. 17G434, in the U. S. National Museum, is a far- 
rier's knife (fig. 1), made and used by M. E. Horigan, horseshoer in 
Washington, D. C. The blade is a wedge-shape piece of steel, flat on 
the lower side and beveled on the upper side, and bent to a hook 
at the other end. The tang is in form of a rectangle 2 inches long. 
The handle is a piece of a rib from an ox; the natural curve is taken 
advantage of in the manufacture; a slight notch is cut on the upper 
end for the thumb, and depressions have been worn on the upper face 
by the fingers of the operator. In order to combine the blade with the 
handle, a saw cut is made on the inner end of the latter for 2 inches. 
The tang is slipped into the saw cut and is held firmly in i)lace by

two rivets passinj; through both it and the handle. Many thousands 

of si)ecimens as rude as this are in use ainonj;- the horseshoers all 

over the United States and Canada. 
Example Cat. No. 153603, in the 

U. S. National Museum, is a curved 

knife from the Micmac Indians of Nova 

Scotia (fig. 2), collected by Dr. G. M- 

West. It has the usual farrier's blade 

let into a narrow notch or stub groove 

on the back of the handle and held by 

a seizing of cord. The handle of hard 

w^ood fits the hand of the workman 

very neatly. 

In this examj)le, as in others, the 

seizing or connective, holding the 
blade and the handle 
together, is easily re- 
moved so as to allow 
the former to be taken 
out and sharpened. 
Especial attention is 
called to the fact that, 
in accordance with 
northern usage, the 
end' of this cord is 
driven into the han- 
dle and held fast by 
means of a wooden 
peg instead of being 
fastened off by being 
tucked under one of 
the former roundings 
itself. Length, 9^ 
inches. 

Example Cat. No. 153004, in the U. S. National 
Museum, is a curved kinfe also from the Micmac Indi- 
ans of Nova Scotia (fig. 3), collected by Dr. G. M.West. 
The blade is of European manufacture, slightly curved, 
let into a groove on top of the handle and neatly seized 
with a thong of rawhide. At one end the thong is 
doubled over the tang and driven into the groove of the 
handle; the other end is drawn through a hole bored 
in the handle, wedged fiist and cut oft", making a very 
neat finish. The handle is made of birch wood and 

curved to fit the hand, the bevel for the thumb being unusually long 

and broad. Length, lOA inches.

The Micmacs are especially wbittlers in bow staves, siiowshoes, aud 
canoe frames. The women also make splint baskets in wickerwork. 
Their household utensils were in wickerwork aud birch 
bark, so they did little adzing. 

Example Oat. No. 54338, in the U. S. National Mu- 
seum, is a curved knife from the Passamaquoddy 
Indians, Eastport, Maine (fig. 4), collected by Mr. K. 
Edward Ear 11. The blade is in form of a farrier's knife, 
let into a stub groove on the back of the handle, and 
held in place by a seizing of wood splint. The handle 
is straight in the grip, and turned up aud beveled at 
the outer end to receive and fit the thumb, as in other 
curved knives. The connective of 
wood splint is specially noteworthy 
in its neat administration and thor- 
oughly aboriginal fastening off, as 
in the two previous specimens from 
the Micmac Indians. ' Length, lOJ 
inches. 

Mr. Lucien Turner says of the 
Nenenot Indians of the Algonquan 
stock, living on the borders of 
the Ungava, in northern Labra- 
dor, "that they make their crooked 
knives of steel files and knife 
blades (fig. 5). The Indian reduces 
the metal to the shape desired, 
flat on one side and beveled on the 
other, by grinding. He then heats 
the blade and gives it the proper 
curve." He also draws attention to 
the fact that left-handed persons 
suit the tool to their hand by bend- 
ing the blade in the proper direc- 
tion. "No Labrador Indian ever goes on a journey 
without a curved knife. The handle is held at right 
angles to the body and drawn toward the user. It is 
employed in all cases for whittling or shaving wood 
and the preparation of the strips and slats of 
canoes, paddles, snowshoes, and everything cut from 
wood. It requires great skill to use the knife prop- 
erly." 

Turner says that "this tool is in universal use both 
among the Eskimo and the Indians of this region." 

Example Cat. No. 153498, in the TJ. S. National Museum, is a curved 
knife from Labrador (fig. G), collected by Dr. H. G. Bryant. The blade

is like that of the farrier's knife. Tlie shank is let into a stub groove 
on the side of the handle; a thin portion of the piece of wood taken out 
is restored and a seizing of tawed buckskin is wrapped around. The 
handle is rectangular and terminated with a curved portion to fit 
the thumb. The noticeable feature of this knife is 
that the shank of the blade is let into the handle in 
such way that when cutting is being done the strain 
conies against the solid wood and not against the 
buckskin lashing, as in a great many examples studied. 
Whittling does not involve hard pressure, so there is 
no necessity for a strong joint, as in the knives for 
carving hard substances. 

Example Cat. No. 153046, in the 
U. S. National INIuseum, is a curved 
knife from the Nascopi Indians of 
Labrador (fig. 7), collected by Mr. 
Charles McLaren. The blade is 
inserted into a stub groove in the 
top of the handle, and this is cov- 
ered by a strip of wood, and all 
lashed together with a rawhide 
band, which is fastened off by tuck- 
ing under at both ends. The han- 
dle is of spruce wood, and the grip 
is straight, but the thumb portion 
is bent up and inward so as to fit 
exactly the curvature of the hand. 
A loop of string at the outer end of 
the handle completes the device. 
Esi^ecial attention is called to the 
neat fastening of the rawhide con- 
nective. Length, inches. 

In the annual report of the Bu- 
reau of Ethnology, Dr. W. J. Hoff- 
man figures a curved knife in general use among 
the Menomini Indians in Wisconsin. These Indi- 
ans are of the Algonquian stock, and one is not 
surprised, therefore, to find a curved knife of the 
same type as those of eastern Canada and the 
United States. The handle has a long slope for the 
thumb; the tang of the blade is let into a stub 
groove on the side of the handle and at the tip end 
carried quite through. The connective jmrtion of 
the handle is also cut in a h)ng groove to secure the cord used in lash- 
ing. The author says that "among the Menominis this knife is used 
jn i)reparing the splints from elm logs, out of which baskets are made."

The cutting is alwiiys done toward the body. In the case of these 
knives it will be seen that the function of splitting, planing, and smooth- 
ing is i^erformed rather than that of excavating and 
finishing ott" large blocks of soft wood. 

The material employed by the Menominis in their 
basketry is tough, and therefore only soft saplings are 
used in their work.' 

Holm figures a large number of men's carving knives.'* 
Seven of his figures give bone or antler handles, four 
have plain wooden handles, and in two of them bone 
and wood are mixed. Seven of these have blades of 
stone and seven have iron blades. The preciousness of 
iron is shown in blades made up of two or three pieces 
or strips of iron riveted together. The blades are all 
inserted into the ends of the handles, most of them by 
driving. Two show evidences of saw-cuts at the ends 
and three have wrappings or bands of twine. The only 
ornamentation on these handles are rings and geomet- 
ric figures made of dots. Four of the bone handles 
are shaxoed somewhat into 
characteristic forms. 

Parry says that " the 
principal tool of the Es- 
kimo of Iglulik was the 
knife (panna); that they 
possessed a great number 
of excellent ones jire- 
viously to his coming, and 
that the work was remark- 
ably coarse and clumsy. 
The manner of holding the 
the knife also was most 
awkward; that is, with 
the edge backward." '

Murdoch declares that the Point Barrow Eskimo have two styles or 
sizes of carver's knives, one large Midlin, with a haft 10 to 20 inches 
long, for wood working, and a small one, Savigron (instrument for 
.shaving), with a haft to 7 inches long, for working bone and ivory. 
The knife is held close to the blade between the index and second 
fingers of the right hand, with the thumb over the edge, which is

It is easy to uiiderstaiul the existence of the two types in the arctic 
area, where soft driftwood exists alongside of antler and ivory. 

Example Cat. No. 208.S1, in the IT. S, National Museum, is a 
curved knife from Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, collected by 
Mr. James G. Swan. The cnrved blade is of iron, with both edges 
alike, and resembles the modern can-opener. To form the joint its 
tang is roughly let into the wooden handle at its end on one side, the 
other side being notched, and is held in place by a lashing of thong. 
The handle of oak is curved upward outside the thumb space and

tapers slightly to the outer end. The noteworthy features are the 
adaptation of a modern can-opener for the blade, the resemblance of 
the handle with its thumb space to Japanese and Korean handles, and 
the notch at the inner end to prevent the slipping of the seizing. 
Mr. D. W. Prentiss, jr., of the U. S. National Museum, had the good 
fortune to observe a Yakutat Indian carving with a large specimen 
of this variety of two-edged blade (Cat. No. 17819G, U.S.N.M.). The 
handle is held in both hands while the carver dresses down the inside 
of his canoe or wooden box. Now chipping toward himself, now away, 
with the greatest rapidity, he gave the fine adz finish often observed

on many objects brought from the ce(hir areas of southeast Alaska. 
In this its perfected form the knife is both chisel and adz, working 
always by pressure (fig. 9). 

Example Cat. No. 16S;)42, in the TT. S. National Museum, is a curved 
knife from the Tliugit Indians of Alaska (fig. 10), collected by Lieut. 
(t. T. Emmons, U. S. N. It consists of a blade of a 
common pocketknife driven into the end of a handle of 
antler and held in place by an iron ferrule and by a 
seizing of rawhide thong. The handle has rings 
scratched around it an inch apart. The example has 
this peculiarity, that the bevel of the blade is under- 
neath, for the workman to cut toward him, and must 
have been designed, therefore, to be used after the 
modern fashion of a trimming chisel. Length, 7^ 
in(;hes. With this knife belongs example Cat. No. 
1G8345, U.S.N.M., a guard of sealskin to be worn on 
the back of the hand (fig. 11), so that when the work- 
man is whittling in a box or canoe he may protect him- 
self. The entire outfit is quite 
modern, but it is remarkable that 
this guard is the only example of 
its kind in the collection. 

Example Cat. No. 20752, in the 
TJ. S. National Museum, is a 
curved knife from Sitka, Alaska 
(fig. 12), collected by Mr. James 
G. Swan. It is evidently made 
up for trade, and shows no sign 
of use, but it has the long han- 
dle of the Yakutat two-handed 
type. The blade, with two edges, 
is lashed by its tang to the side 
of a pine handle by means of a 
buckskin thong, which last is the 
only aboriginal part of the ap- 
paratus, and is laid on in a slov- 
enly manner, and any savage would be ashamed 
to use it on his own account. 

Since ethuograi)hic nuiterial has entered into 
commerce the Museum curator is vexed continu- 
ally by receiving specimens that never had any 
serious aboriginal use. Furthermore, trade centers, such as Una- 
laska, Sitka, Victoria, and Honolulu, where in tlie old days whalers 
met and exchanged or i)awned their collections from different places, 
specimens were carried far from their original source, and now can be 
identified only by comparing them with well-authenticated objects.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 



Example Cat. No. 12997G, in the U. S. National Museum, is a wood 
carver's knife from the Kwakiutl Indians of Fort Rui)ert, British 
Columbia (fig. 13), collected by Mr. James G. Swan, and forms a tran- 
sition between old art and European art. The blade 
is that of a modern jackknife set into the end of an 
oak handle and held firm by a ferrule of sheet brass 
nailed on. Here are united in a single Joint the most 
primitive and most persistent connective, namely, a 
tang driven into tlie grain of the handle at the work- 
ing end and metal ferrule, the latest form of bond. 
The handle is slightly curved, and bears on its end 
and surface a carving of a totemic animal's head and 
fins. Length, 8^ inches. 

Example Cat. No. 129978, in the U. S. National 
Museum, is a similar knife, with jackknife blade in a 
very plain handle without carving (fig. 14). To form 
the joint the inner end of the 
handle has a saw-cut made 
across, into which the tang of 
the blade is set and made fast 
by a wire driven through the 
hinge hole. Stovepipe wire is 
wrapped about the joint, and 
a wedge of wood and one of 
iron driven in between the 
edges of the tang and the wire. 
Outside the wire is a wrapping 
of cotton rag to protect the 
hand. This example shows 
that there is plasticity even in 
the savage mind. The elements 
of this old form have been 
nearly all patented inventions. 
Example Oat. No. 129977, in the U. S. Na- 
tional Museum, is a curved knife of the Fort 
liupert or Kwakiutl Indians (fig. 15), collected 
by Mr. James G. Swan. It consists of a blade 
bent up at the top, beveled only on the upper 
side, and by its shank lashed to a shouldered 
cut on the handle. The handle is of oak and is 
also curved. The two parts are held together 
by a seizing of twine, and outside of this a wrap- 
ping of blue cloth. Length of handle, 8 inches. 

Example Cat. No. 150715, in the U. S. National Museum, is a curved 
knife of the Ainos of Yo/o (fig. IG), collected by Mr. K. Hitchcock. The

sliglitly curved and has a chamfer for the tbumb. There is no attempt 
at cementing or seizing or ratcheting on the tang. The bond is in 
effect a very ancient connective done in iron. Length, 7^ inches. 

Example Cat. No. 150715 {a), in the U. S. National Museum, is 
similar to the foregoing excepting that the blade is straight and there 
is a slight carving at the outer end of the handle. The handle in both 
of these specimens seems to be left hand, inasmuch as the bevel and 
curve of the blade and the chamfer tit the left hand and do not fit the 
right. The great nuinber of whittling knives of this species in eastern 
Asia raises some interesting questions of the method of intrusion of the 
Iron Age into the aboriginal life of the Western World. 

In the area between Bering Strait and the Aleutian Islands, under 
the influence of Russian traders and the whaling industry, great num- 
bers of carver's knives in endless variety are found. The largest col- 
lection from this region has been made by Mr. E. W. Nelson, and the 
forms of whittling knives, carving knives, and etching knives will be 
found fully illustrated in Mr. Nelson's work. 

A large and interesting series of curved knives were collected by 
von Schrenck about the mouth of the Amoor River and northward, and 
are now iu the Imperial Museum at Moscow. These knives represent 
all of the different classes spoken of in this paper, to wit: Knives with 
straight blades, for ordinary domestic purposes; those with long curve, 
for ordinary whittling; those with abrupt curve at the end, as in the 
farrier's knife, for excavating canoes and boxes; and those with sharp 
points, for engraving on hard substances. The handles are either plain 
or ornamented and have a short or a long bevel for the thumb. Those 
which have a decided sidewise curve are always fitted to the right hand 
and cut toward the person (fig. 17). 

CONCLUSION. 

I find that in the emjiloyment of the curved knife the Eskimo, the 
(3anadian tribes, together with their kindred on the northern boundary 
of the United States, and, more than all, the North Pacific tribes on 
both sides of the ocean have exhausted the possibilities of an imple- 
ment that has been in the hands of some only a century or two. 

The arts of all these tribes were bettered and not degraded by the 
curved knife. In every case they were immensely improved. The form 
of knife with straight, short blade made it possible for the northern 
and western tribes to become better carvers and engravers. Before 
the possession of iron there is meager evidence that either of these 
areas possessed other than the most trivial carvings in hard material. 
Their best results were in soft wood and slate, by means of beaver 
tooth or shark's tooth knives. 

The curved knife serves to confirm the opinion that as soon as any 
process or device came within the scope of a people's intelligence they 
have mastered it and brought it to a climax, from which time on new 
ideas and new inventions replaced the old.

CLASSIFICATION OP THI: MIXHRAL COLLHCTIONS IN THE 
U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



By Wirt Tassin, 
Assinlant Curator, Divmon of Aliiuraloyy. 



PREFACE. 



This outliue is preliminary to au exhaustive descriptive catalogue, 
aud is issued iu response to numerous requests for methods of classifi- 
cation, arrangement, etc. 

The series is divided into two general classes — native elements and 
compounds of the elements. The compounds of the elements are further 
divided and grouped under certain heads according to, and which take 
their names from, their more negative constituents as follows: Com- 
pounds of the halogens, fluorides, chlorides, bromides, and iodides. 
Compounds of sulphur, selenium, and tellurium; also arsenic and anti- 
mony, including sulphides, selenides, and tellurides; arsenides, anti- 
monides, sulpharsenides, and sulphantimonides; also sulphosalts. 
Oxygen compounds, including oxides and the oxygen salts, borates, 
aluminates, chromites, ferrites, manganites, plumbates, arsenites and 
antimonites, selenites aud tellurites, carbonates, silicates, titanates, 
columbates aud tantalates, nitrates, vanadates, phosphates, arsenates 
and antimonates, sulphates, selenates and tellurates, chromates, molyb- 
dates and tungstates, iodates, and uranates. Compounds of organic 
origin, including salts of organic acids and carbon comjiounds. 

Each of these classes is further separated into groups, the minerals 
included in any one group being such as are related in the details of 
chemical composition. Each of these groups is preceded by a general 
group label giving the class to which it belongs, the group name, the 
minerals composing that group, together with their chemical composi- 
tion, system of crystallization, and a short description of the occurrence, 
association, and characteristic form of each member of the group. The 
following label will serve to give a clearer idea of this arrangement :

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 



Wolframiie. — Chiefly ferrous tungstatc, with some mauganese. It occurs in irregu- 
lar lamellar, coarso divergent columnar, and granular masses, and in crystals, com- 
monly tabular. Color and streak nearly black. Wolframite is often associated with 
tin ores, and with quartz carrying bismuth, sclieelitc, pyrite, galena, sphalerite, etc. 

Hiihnerile. — Chiefly manganese tungstate, with some iron. It occurs in bladed 
forms and massive in quartz, and with alabandite, rhodonite, scheelite, fluoritc, and 
apatite. Color brownish red, hair brown to nearjy black. Streak yellowish brown. 

Following the group label, arranged iu order from left to right, are 
tlie several members of tlie group, selected to illustrate as completely 
as possible their occurrences, associations, and variety in form aiid 
color. Each specimen is mounted upon a block, in front of which is a 
small label giving the name of the species, the minerals associated with 
it in that particular specimen, if any, its locality, catalogue' number, 
and from wliom and how received. 

The several grou])S are placed in regular order in the cases, and each 
case carries a case label giving the name of the class to which its con- 
tents are referred. In the upper left-hand corner of each case is a 
numeral followed by an arrow, which serves to indicate the sequence 
in which the cases are to be studied, and also to facilitate leference to 
the text of a descriptive catalogue to be printed. 

CLASSIFICATION. 

I. ELEMENTS. 

Of the seventy or more elements at present known to chemistry but 
eighteen, excluding those occurring only in the gaseous state, are found 
native. With the native elements are included the native alloys, or 
compounds and mixtures of elements belonging to the same groups in 
the periodic system.

II. COMPOUNDS OF THE ELEMENTS. 

The great majority of minerals are compounds of elements. By a 
comi)Ound is meant that body produced by the combination of two or 
more elements, and which is different in its nature from and whose 
pro])erties as a rule are not the mean of those of its constituents. A 
compound is to be distinguished from a mixture or simple mechanical 
aggregation in that it always implies a chemical union of its compo- 
nents, and therefore possesses a definite chemical composition. 

Among minerals the compounds of the elements may be arranged, in 
accordance with certain chemical laws, under the following heads: 

A. Compounds of the halogens — Huorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. 

B. Compounds of sulphur, selenium, and tellurium; also arsenic, anti- 
mony, bismuth, and germanium. C. Oxygen compounds. D. Com- 
pounds of organic origin. 

A. COMPOUNDS OF THE HALOGENS— FLUORINE, CHLORINE, BROMINE, 

AND IODINE. 

The halogens — fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine — form simple 
and complex compounds with other elements. The halides, as these 



752 



REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 



compounds are called, are derivatives of HF, HCI, HBr, and HI, and 
are divided chemically into four classes — duorides, chlorides, bromides, 
and iodides — according- to the nature of the negative constituent. 
Two of the halogens — fluorine and chlorine — enter into the composi- 
tion of several oxidized compounds, called oxytluorides and oxychlo- 
rides — compounds in which there is a metallic fluoride or chloride with 
a basic oxide of the same metal.

B. COMPOUNDS OF SULPHUR, SELENIUM, AND TELLURIUM; ALSO 
ARSENIC, ANTIMONY, AND BISMUTH. 

This division includes the non oxidized compounds of suli)hur, sele- 
nium, and tellurium ; also arsenic, antimony, and bismuth. It embraces 
the sulphides, selenides, and tellurides of the elements; also the arse- 
nides, antiraonides, and bismuthides, the sulpharsenides, sulphanti- 
monides, and sulphbismuthides, and the sulphosalts. 

SULPHIDES, SELENIDES, AND TELLURIDES. 

The elements sulphur, selenium, and tellurium bear a marked resem- 
blance to one another and present close analogies in their properties, 
occurrence, and mode of combining with other elements. The terms 
sulphide, selenide, and telluride include all those compounds, derivatives 
of H2S, H2Se, and HiTe, in which sulphur, selenium, or tellurium forms 
the sole or chief negative part. The three negative elements are essen- 
tially isomori)hous and may replace one another in varying amounts.

CLASS, — ARSENIDES, ANTIMONIDF.S, AND lUSMUTHIDES. 

Arsenic, antimony, and bisnnitli are analogons in tlieir properties 
and unite with other elements to form arsenides, antimouides, and bis- 
muthides. Arsenic and antimony, and to a certain extent bismuth, are 
essentially isomorphous and may replace one another in varying 
amounts. With the arsenides, antimouides, and bismuthides are 
included the sulpharsenides, sulphantimonides, and sulphbismuthides — 
compounds in which tlie negative i)art is taken by arsenic, antimony, 
or bismuth with sulphur.

CLASSIFICATION OF MINFI.'ALS. 
C. OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. 



761 



From tlie abundance of oxygen and its nearly universal affinities its 
combinations form by far the laruest number of the compounds of the 
elements. The muierals of this division fall into two general groups. 
To the first group the general name oxides is given ; to the second, oxy- 
gen salts. The oxygen salts include a number of classes of minerals, 
such as carbonate, silicate, and phosphate. 

CLASS, — OXIDF.S. 

The compounds resulting from the union of oxygen with other ele- 
ments bear the general name oxides. Considering the class as a whole, 
the hydrogen atom or atoms in the typic-al oxide II^O maybe rei)]aced 
by a single element, as in cuprite CU2O, or by a group of elements, as 
in gilthite FeO(OH). Further, the oxygen may be replaced in part by 
sulphur, as in kermesite Sb.S-/); thus giving rise to three general 
groups: anhydrous oxides, hydroxides, and sulphoxides.

OXVGEN salts: class, — SILICATKS. 



The silicates, derivatives of the several silicic acids H4Si04, H28iO.-„ 
H2Si07, H2Si05, and HjSisOa, or compounds of silicon oxide with other 
oxides, constitute about nine tenths of the known crust of the earth 
and more than one fourth of the known kinds of minerals. Isomorphic 
combinations are the rule, and tlie class exhibits great diversitj^ of 
composition. For example, the ratio of oxygen iu silica to that in com- 
bined oxide may vary for monad and dyad elements, such as potassium 
or calcium, between 2:4 and 4:1; and for silicates of triad elements, 
such as aluminuui or iron, between L*:G and 12:3. Again, it is not 
unusual to find a silicate containing both potassium and calcium, or 
the oxides of iron and aluminum, or of calcium and aluminum, and 
that not necessarily in atomic proportion. But although certain oxides 
are capable of mutual replacement in any and all proportions, such as 
the sesqnioxides of iron, aluminum, etc., or the monoxides of calcium, 
magnesium, iron, manganese, sodium, lithium, etc.; and though a sili- 
cate may contain at once a mixture of sesquioxides and monoxides in 
combination with silica, the place of a monoxide is not taken by a ses- 
qnioxide, nor that of a sesquioxide by a monoxide.

THE /.KOLITKS. 



The zeolites — groups 50 to 01 — are silicates of aluminum with sodium 
and calcium chietly, less ofteu strontium and barium. They are all 
secondary minerals, all yield water upon ignition, and occur most com- 
nvouly in cavities and seams of the more basic eruptive rocks. With 
them are included three groups, G2 to 64, of minerals which, though 
not true zeolites, are similar to them in general structure and occur- 
rence.

OXYdEX SALTS: CLASS, — ARSENATES AND ANTIMONATES. 

This class, derivatives of H3RO4, H^RO^, etc., includes those com- 
pouuds of oxides with oxides whose negative parts are taken by arsenic 
pentoxide or antimony pentoxide. They are similar to the pliosi»liates 
in molecular structure, and, like them, are either normal or basic salts 
both with and without water of crystallization. Further, they may 
crystallize Avith a fluoride, chloride, or hydroxyl. As a class they pre- 
sent many analogies to the phosphates, and like salts, as a rule, are 
isomorphous.

OXYGEN salts: CLASS, — CHROMATES. 

The chromates, derivatives of H2Cr04, or compounds of chromium 
trioxide with other oxides, have but few representatives among 
minerals. Tliey are isoniorphous with the corresponding sulphates, 
and, like them, may be either normal or basic salts j further, they may 
crystallize with carbonates and phosphates.

OXYGEN SALTS: CLASS, — MOLYHDATES AND TUNGSTATES. 

The molybdates and tungstates are derivatives of H2M0O4 and 
H2WO4, or compounds of oxides with oxides whose negative parts 
are taken by molybdenum and tungsten trioxides, respectively. Among 
minerals normal salts only are known.

OXYGEN salts: CLASS, — lODATES. 

There are but two luetnbers of this class, derivatives of I(0H)7, at 
present Ivnowii amoug luiuerals. One is a uormal salt, the other a 
double salt.

OXYGEN SALTS: CLASS, — URANATES. 

The uranates, derivatives of U(OH)ii, or compounds of the oxides of 
uranium with other oxides, are very complex in composition. They 
contain, in addition to the oxides of uranium, the oxides of thorium, 
zirconium, yttrium, and the cerium metals. Certain of the uranates 
also contain nitrooeu and helium in an unknown state of combination.

D. COMPOUNDS OF ORGANIC ORIGIN. 

This division may be separated into two general groups — salts of 
oxalic and mellic acids and other carbon compounds. This last com- 
prises the various kinds of mineral wax, the fossil resins, the asphal- 
tums, mineral oils, coals, etc. They are in general sinii)ly mixtures. 
The salts of the organic acids, oxalates, and mellates only are here 
given.

INTRODUCTION. 

A spear is a long, pointed weapon, held in the hand, used in war and 
hunting-, more by thrusting than throwing. Lance is synonymous with 
spear, though it may be smaller and lighter, but longer, used either by 
thrusting or throwing. A javelin is shorter, smaller, and lighter than 
the spear or lance and is better adapted to throwing by the hand. All 
of them may, in case of need, be used in band-to-hand combats or in 
an assaulting column. 

A harpoon is a spear or Javelin with barbs or toggles, usually thrown 
at hsh or marine animals, though specialized for striking whales. 

An arrow is similar to a javelin, but shorter, smaller^ lighter, and to 
be shot from a bow. It is a missile and purely offensive. In prehistoric 
times and before metals were in use these were tipped with stone or bone. 

Tlie arrowpoints, spearheads, and knives of the prehistoric races, 
when made of stone, have such a likeness of form and style that a 
sharp line of division between them is impracticable. A small imple- 
ment may be an arrowhead; a large one of the same type may be a 
spearhead, while either or both may have served as knives. The dis- 
tinction might be better made if the shafts or handles remained, but 
these, together with the lashings and attachments, have decayed and 
disappeared, except occasionally where bitumen or gum was employed. 
An implement of this kind, whether large or small, with a light shaft 
2 or 3 feet long would be an arrow; the same with a heavy shaft 8 or 10 
feet long would be a spear, while either of them with a shaft a foot or 
less in length would be a knife, dagger, or poniard. Indeed, an imple- 
ment of the latter class might be accidentally made through the break- 
ing of a spear or arrow shaft. Few if any of these implements of the 
real prehistoric; man have been found with their shafts or handles and 
lashings or fastenings, and so we are largely driven to theory and 
analogy for their names and uses. In modern times the perfect arrow, 
first with a stone head, afterwards with one of iron, and shaft attached, 
was used in great numbers by the North American Indians; spears com- 
plete, with stone or iron head and shaft attached, were used by the Eski- 
mos, and knives with short handles have been found among the Hupa 
Indians of Oregon and California, and a few in prehistoric graves on the

This paper deals ])rincii)ally with the prehistoric arrowpoint and 
spearhead, beginning with the ruder forms of cutting, piercing, or 
throwing weai)ons or implements in the Paleolithic i)eriod, and dealing 
with the subject in all its characteristics. Bows are in-actically un- 
noticed, as most specimens from prehistoric times have decayed, but 
one or two having been found, and these only preserved by being 
under water or in peat beds.

Aiypearance of the spear in the Mousterien epoch — Appearance of the har- 
poon in the Solutreen epoch — Spear or harpoon heads irith shoulder on

The spear belongs to an earlier epoch in man's civilization than does 
the arrow. Although they are similar in ap])earance, they differ 

greatly in age. The former appeared in 
the Paleolithic period, while the lat- 
ter did not appear until the Neolithic.

I'aleolithic period. Tbey were probably never used with a handle, for 
it is hard to conceive an impleinent so ill contrived for attachment to 
a handle. They are nearly the shape of an almond or peach stone 
(fi^s. 1, 2). A ])ortion of the natural crust of the Hint pebbles was left 
at the butt of some of these implements for a grip, thus showiui; tliat 
they were intended to be held in tlie hand, and not to be handled for 
use as spears or javelins. These implements are not thin and flat so as 
to be inserted in a split handle, and whether attempted longitudinally 
as for a spear, or transversely as for an axe, it would be Avith difficulty 
that any of them could either then or now be retained in a liandle. If 
iusertedin a wooden han- 
dle a sufficient distance 
tohold, a blow given witli 
force would drive it into 
and through the wood? 
and would certainly split 
the handle. Being in- 
sufficiently inserted, it 
would fly out. 

We are not driven to 
theory entirely with re- 
gard to this matter, for 
aside from the fact that 
some of these are left 
with the butt of the flint 
pebble for a grip, the in 
veutive genius of man 
has not yet been able to 
discover and employ a 
handle that could be at- 
tached to these or similar 
implements without be- 
ing open to one of these 
objections. Attempts 
have been made in this 
direction by several per- 
sons, notably in a series in Oarnavalet Museum, the municipal museum 
of Paris. An inspection of this series or of any of the implements 
themselves will show the impracticability of handling them. 

It does not necessarily follow, because these Chelleeu implements 
ere not put in a handle and used as spears, that, therefore, the man 
of that period had no spear, for a sapling or branch of a tree, sharp- 
ened and hardened by fire, would have made a most effective weapon of 
the spear or javelin sort. It may be objected that no such objects have 
ever been found, yet this is not conclusive against the i)ossibility of the 
wooden implement having been iiuidc, for, being wood, it might have 
decayed long before the historic i»eriod.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 



Ill the middle part of the Paleolithic period an implement appeared 
which we may well supi)ose to have been the head of a spear or javelin 
(fiS-s. 3, 4). 

These implements have been called Mousterien points from their hav- 
ing been fonnd in pnrity and i)rofusion in the cavern of Monstier on 
the river \'czcre in France. Their character is shown by the two 
figures, being the oj^posite sides of 
the same implement, obverse and 
reverse. They are smooth flakes of 
flint, thin, rather heavy at the butt, 
tapering on sides and edges to a i)oint. 
They were struck from a core of flint 
at a single blow, which left a broad, 
flat surface on the inside, showing the 
conchoid of percussion. The workmen 
in manufacturing the implement left 
this side in its original condition as it 
came from the block. The outer side

was chipped by small flakes to a regular outline and made sharp along 
the two <'dges and at the point. None of the objections made to the 
handling of the Chelleen implement apply to this. It was and is easy 
to insert this implement into a cleft stick and fasten it tightly either 
with thongs or bitumen so as to be effective as a spear or javelin. 
There is no positive evidence that they were -thus used, but the fact 
that it could have been done, that similar implements were and are thus

used among savages, and that those be- 
longing to the preceding epoch couhl not 
have been thus used, establishes a fair pre- 
sumption in that behalf. This fact being 
admitted, these represent the earliest 
spearheads made by man. If these imple- 
ments were rare, the argument would be 
correspondingly feeble, but they havebeen 
found in great numbers over a large por- 
tion of western Europe, and the epoch to 
which they belonged is believed by M. de 
Mortillet to have been of greater duration 
than any other in the Paleolithic period. 

In the continuation of the Cavern period 
to what M. de Mortillet calls the Solutrt-en 
epoch, where the inventive genius and the 
mechanical ability of man became higher, 
implements are found which establish be- 
yond dispute their use as spears or jave- 
lins. True, they have been used as har- 
poons, but what is a harpoon but a barbed 
spear or lance? Many of them were of 
bone or horn. Figs. 5, G, 7, 8, and 9 are 
here introduced as typical representations 
of thousands which have been found in 
southern France, belonging to this epoch of 
the Paleolithic period. Those here shown 
are of reindeer horn and are about natural 
size. Observe the straight, smooth, taper- 
ing i^oints. In one of them (fig. 5) the base 
is bifurcated to receive the end of a shaftj 
another has the base brought to a i^oint 
for insertion into the shaft, and, after the 
fashion of the Eskimo and other fisher peo- 
ple, it has a hole apparently for the attach- 
ment to its shaft bj^ string (fig. 6). The 
others, larger ones, have at their base an 
enlargement or swelling, over which the 
hollow shaft can be forced for a given dis- 
tance, which, lashed tightly with a thong, 
wiU keep it firm, or, inserted but slightly, 
will allow it to pull out and remain in a 
wound while the shaft is released (figs. 
7-10).

Paleolithic i)eriod entirely disassociated

with objects of the l!^eolitliic period, constitute satisfactory evidence 
that man of the Paleolithic i)erio(l made and used harpoons, and conse- 
quently must have been able to make spears and javelius. The differ- 
ence between the two is more in name than aught else. They are both 
used in the same way, both serve the same ])urpose, and with the varia- 
tion of material and barbs are essentially the same Aveapon. 

These bone and horn harpoons serve to elucidate similar implements of 

the same period made of flint and to identify 
them as spears or javelins and not arrows. 

Figs. 11, ]2, 13, and 14 show a number of 
the well-known ' leaf-shaped implements, 
called in France feuille de lanricr, or laurel 
leaf, from their resemblance to it in shape. 
This period represents as high a degree of 
mechanical skill in flint chipping as any 
other in the world's history. 

An examination of these implements is 
required to understand the delicacy of their 
manufacture. It required much experience 
to obtain the needed amount of manual 
dexterity. One of these leaf-shaped imple- 
ments, found en cache "with ten others, is 
shown in lig. 11. It is one ot the largest, 
being 14 inches long, 3^ inches broad, and 
its greatest thickness is less than three- 
eighths of an inch. The original is in the 
museum of Chalon-sur-Saone. The imple- 
ment is made entirely by chipping, the fin- 
ishing on the edge of which would aiq)ear 
to have been done by pressure and not by 
strokes. No flint-knapper of the present 
day, whether amateur or professional, has 
yet been able to reproduce one of these fine 
Solutreen leaf-shaped implements. The 
U. S. IS^ational Museum has had many times 
to contend with fraudulent and spurious 
specimens which showed considerable manual dexterity, but it has 
never been presented with counterfeits of these beautiful implements. 
They were i)erfectly adapted for insertion in a handle and could then 
be used with effect as spears or javelins, according to their size and 
weight. They might have been taken in the hand and used as knives, 
the hand being protected by a bit of the skin of an animal or a bunch 
of grass. They were of all sizes (the figures are two-thirds natural 
size) and came down from the large one just mentioned, through gradar 
tions, to those not more than three-fourths of an inch long and one- 
half an inch wdde. Figs. 15 to 18 show implements of the same

epoch, tbe shoulder being on one side, contrary to the arrow and spear 
heads of the ISTeolithic i)eri<)d, and bearing a great simihirity to its 
brother, the harpoon. 

These and similar implements, made of bone and horn, were contin- 
ued in use throughout the Paleolithic i^eriod. So it is proved by 
deduction aiul induction that the bow and 
arrow did not make its appearance during 
the Paleolithic period, but are later than 
cither the spear or javelin. 

The author does not forget 
the differences of opinion be- 
tween M. de Mortillet and M. 
d' Acy as to the various types of 
Paleolithic im- 
plements, and 
the extinctfauna 
associated there- 
with, found ill

land. He knows 
also the subdi- 
vision called St. 
Acheulecn, pro- 
posed by M. 
d'Ault Dumes- 
nil, and he does 
not enter into 
any of these dis- 
c u s s i o n s . His 

position in this paper does not conflict with 
either. Whether the Mousterien point was 
contemporaneous with the Chellcen imple- 
ment, or was subsequent to it, or how many 
changes or epochs are represented by the 
two styles of implements, does not affect 
the statement that the Chellcen implement 
probably was not, and the Mousterien 
probably was, used as a spearhead, and 
that despite the stemmed and barbed har- 
poons of the Solutrc'cn or Cavern period, there is no evidence that 
the bow and arrow was known or used during the Paleolithic period. 
In this position the author is sustained by one of the highest authori- 
ties on the subject in the United States, Prof. Henry W. Haynes, of

II. THE ORIGIN, INVENTION, AND EVOLUTION OF THE BOW AND 

ARROW. 

Griffin unknown — A wonderful contrivance — lU mythology — Its history — 
Arroic release in antiquity. 

Of the origin of the bow and arrow, history is silent. We know 
nothing whatever of its origin from any written word or description 
in any language or of any people. It is entirely prehistoric. Our only 
knowledge of its beginning comes from such of the remains of human 
industry belonging to prehistoric times as have been found in modern 
times. We can easily base our conclusions on comparisons of these 
remains. We have seen how the spear and harpoon and possibly the 
javelin belonged to the Paleolithic period or chipped-stone age; and 
now we will see how the bow and arrow was an invention of the Neo- 
lithic period or polished-stone age. But both these ages lie far back in 
the past, earlier than any written history, and were unknown to the 
world until the discoveries of the nineteenth century. 

A stick or staff sharpened or hardened by fire might make a spear. 
Herodotus- says, describing the ai^my of Xerxes, that "the Libyans 
marched clad in leather garments and made use of javelins hardened 
by fire" (pp. ^'6Q, 847). To tip the staff with a bit of fiint would V)e bat the 
first step in the evolution of a better weapon, which, once taken, might 
continue througli all its varieties, from the heaviest and longest si)ear 
to the shortest and lightest javelin — from one which was too heavy to 
carry and was simply to be held u]) after the fashion of an abattis 
protecting the holder against an onslaught, down to a lighter and 
smaller implement which he could hurl at his enemy. All this is in the 
natural evolution of an invention. One might grow out of the other. 
We have no positive Icnowledge that this was the manner of growth, 
but we may easily surmise it, if not with the Libyans, then with some 
other and possibly more primitive peo^^le. 

Hence we can see how the commonly accepted law of evolution and 
progress may be set at naught by observed facts. The Libyans were 
noted soldiers and formed part of the greatest army of earth, and one 
would suppose a priori that their arms would have been of the most 
approved pattern, but their javelins were the most primitive and rude 
type, the beginning — really the first step — in warfare; the protoplasm 
of weapons; the stafi' sharpened and hardened by fire. So much for 
spear and javelin. 

The bow and arrow is a different weapon, and its invention had no

relation witb tlie spear, lance, or javeliu. It is a niacliiue, rcciuiring the 
combined action of two objects. It was the first ])rojectile wca])on 
known to or used by man. The world has accei)ted the existence of 
the bow and arrow without uuich thought of its ori- 
gin. It belonged to i)ri(nitive n)an, and we received 
it as though part of him. IJut a moment's consider- 
ation of the contiition of a savage 
who had never seen or heard of any 
machine by which missiles could 
be tlnowii farther or harder than 
he could <lo it with his haud — that 
this savage should have invented 
the spring of the bow, should have 
utilized it by tightening the cord, 
and arranged the whole so that by 
drawing the cord and its sudden 
release, could project an arrow 
with such force as to be an effective weapon — that 
he could do this is a matter of wonder. This inven- 
tion of the savage is one of the triumphs of miud. 
It is an illustration of the inventive genius and intellectuality of man. 
There is but little doubt that it marked an -epoch iu that dead and gone 
civilization equal to the discovery iu the later years of its complement 
and successor, gunpowder, and it may have wrought 
as great a change in man's condition on earth. 

Iu whatever quarter of the globe or among what- 
ever people the bow and arrow has been found, it 
antedates all our knowledge of it or them as ob- 
tained through history. The earliest writers of an- 
ti(juity mention the bow and ar- 
row as an implement of warfare 
orthe chase as though it wasthen 
an old and well-known weapon. 
Homer, Herodotus, Tacitus, 
►Strabo, and Pliny all mention it. 
The many references to it in the 
earlier books of the Bible show it to have been at 
that time a weapon in common use. 

Prof. E. S. Morse, in his study of the different modes 
of arrow release,' (figs. 10, 20, 21, 22, and 23) shows 
the existence of the bow and arrow in early Egyp- 
tian, Assyrian, Etruscan, and Grecian times, from 
the ancient sculptures and bas reliefs, although it is 
onlyincidental to his subject. If its existence or origin had been in ques- 
tion his illustrations could have been multiplied numberless times from 
the ancient sculptures, bas-reliefs, painted vases, and coins of antiquity.

Whether these arrowheads were of stone or metal can not be known 

from the representations; bnt the earliest mentioned by historians are 

of metal. 
The bow is represented on the most ancient monuments. In classic 
art it is an attribute of Apollo, Cupid, Diana, Her- 
cules, and the Centaurs. The form represented was 
thatof the Greek 
bow — two arcs 
united by a 
straight piece 
in the middle. 
Grecian mythol- 
ogy attributes 
the invention of 
the bow to Scy- 
thes, the son of 
Hercules, or to 
Perse, the son of 
Perseus, but 

Herodotus supposes this to be a tradition of the skill in archery of the 

Scythians and Persians, 
Smith, in his Dictionary of Greek and Koman Antiquities, under the 

title "Demosii," says: 

Another class of public slaves lormed the city guard of Athens, 
* * * they were generally called 
bowmen * * ^ or, from the native 
country of the majority, Scythians. 

And again, under the title "Ar- 
cus:" "The form of the Scythian 
and Parthian bow differed from 
that of the Greeks," and he figures 
the two (figs. 24, 25). 

He continues, saying that Homer 
has described the Greek bow ' as 
made of two i)ieces of horn, and 
the bowstring of thongs of leather 
twisted, but Pandarus's bow was 
strung with sinew. The bowstring 
was fastened at one end of the 
bow, and at the other there 
hung a hook or ring of metal 
into which the string was caught 
when the bow was to be used: 
when not in use, the bow was 
unstrung and ])ut in a case of leather, ornamented^ as shown in fig. 26.

ARKOWPOINT5?, SPEARHEADS, AND KNIVEIS. 833 

The arrowheads were of bronze, Homer says "three-toiigued," as 
showu in fig. 27, and those from Marathon shown further on (fig. 28). 
The arrow shafts were of light wood or smooth cane, 
well polished. 

In the Trojan war the spear, lance, or Javelin was 
the principal weapon and used in all three caiiaci- 
ties, according to the need. It could naturally be 
thrown but a short distance in the immediate pres- 
ence of the enemy, and was sometimes used in hand

Achilles, in the combat with Hector: 

* ^ * and, ])oising', hurled bis weighty spear, 
but Hector saw and shnuued the blow ; he stooped, 
Aod o'er his shoulder Hew the brass-tipped spear, 
And in the ground was fixed: but Pallas drew 
Tlie weapon forth, and to Achilles' baud, 
All unobserved of Hector, gave it back. 

Then Hector: 

Poising, hurled his ponderous spear. 
Nor missed his aim; full in the midst he struck 
Pelides' shield; but, glancing from the shield, 
The weapon glided olit'. Hector was grieved 
That thus his spear had bootless left his baud. 
He stood aghast; no second spear was nigh: 
And loudly on Deiphobus he called 
A spear to briug; but he was far away. 

Again Hector: 

Thus as he spoke, his sharp-edged sword he drew, 
Ponderous and vast, suspended at his side ; 
Collected for the spring and forward dashed. * * * 
Achilles' wrath was roused: with fury wild 
His soul was filled: before his breast he bore 
His well-wrought shield; and fiercely on his brow 
Nodded the four-plumed helm, * * * 
Gleamed the sharp-pointed lance, which in his right 
Achilles poised, on god-like Hector's doom 
Intent, and scanning eagerly to see 
Where from attack his body least was fenced. 
All else the glittering armour guarded well, # » » 
One chink appeared, just where the collar bone 
The neck and shoulder parts, beside the throat, ► ^ » 
There levelled he. [Hiad, XXII, 320. 

In the combat with Ajax, Hector:

Of tough Imll's bide; tlnough six it dri)V<! its "\v;iy 

With stuliliorn force, but in the wevcuth was stayed. 

Then Ajax hurled in turn his ])onderoiis spear, 

And struck the circle true of Hector's shield: 

Right through the glittering shield the stout spear passed, 

And through the well-wrought breastjdato drove its way, 

And underneath, the linen vest it tore; 

Jiut Hector, stooping, shunned the stroke of death. 

Witlidrawing then their weapons, each on each 
They fell. * * * 

Then Hector fairly in the center struck 
The stubborn shield; yet drove not through the spear; 
For the stout brass the blunted jioint repelled. 
But Ajax, with a ibrward bound, the shield 
Of Hector pierced; right through the Aveapou passed. [Hiad, VII, 273. 

The spear shaft was made of ash, and was tough aud strong, thus: 

The son of Peleus threw 
His straight-directed spear; his mark he missed. 
But struck the lofty bank, where, deep infixed 
To half its length, the Pelian ash remained. 
Then from beside his thigh Achilles drew 
His trenchant blade, aud, furious, onward rushed; 
While from the clift' Asteropicus strove 
In vain, with stalwart hand, to wrench the sjicar. 
Three times he shook it with impetuous Jbrce, 
Three times relaxed his grasp ; a fourth attempt 
He made to bend and break the sturdy shaft. [Iliad, XXI, 192. 

Their spears lost or broken, they resorted to their swords: 

Then Peneleus aud Lycon, hand to hand, 
Engaged iu combat: both had missed their aim. 
And bootless hurled their weapons: then with swords 
They met. First Lycorn ou the crested helm 
Dealt a fierce blow; but in his hand tlie blade 
Up to the hilt was shivered. Then the sword ' 

Of Peneleus * * * 
* * * deei)ly in his throat the blade 
Was plunged. [Iliad, XYI, 385. 

One of the tactical maneuvers of the Greek soldier was to thrust 
the lance into and through the shield of his opi^onent, and while he 
was disengaging it to attack him with the sword. 

The swords, shields, and armor are described by Homer, and, as 
already seen, most of the combats were hand to hand. It is curious to 
consider that until the invention of the sling and the bow and arrow 
there was no projectile weapon used in warfare except the lance or 
javelin. The knights of ancient times, as well as inedtTeival, fought in 
armor, and whether on foot, on horse, or in a chariot, they i)ressed the 
light hand to hand. It seems curious in these days of long-range guns 
to think of great wars carried on as prize fighters would, and that 
beyond arms' length meant out of danger. 

Archers could not carry shields, and so were driven to ask protection

of some spear — or swordsman, aud this may have had such implication 
of cowardice or degradation as to account for the rarity of the use of 
the bow and arrow, for it seems certain that while it was used in 
the Trojan war it performed but a subordinate part. Paris was an 
expert archer; Teucer had a bow; Meriones discharges an arrow which 
strikes Menelaus. " Pandarus the god-like, Lycao's son,'' was the 
skilled archer from Crete. His bow, arrow, and quiv^er are described, 
and how he was called to act the i)art of the sharpshooter. Diomedes 
was dealing destruction among the Greeks when .Eneas sought 
Pandarus — 

* * * and addi'essed him thus: 
"Where, Paudarus, are now thy wingod shafts, 
Thy bow, and well-known skill, wherein with thee 
Can no man here contend':? Nor Lycia boasts 
Through all her wide-spread ^ilains a truer aim. 
Then raise to ,Iove thj' hands, and with thy shaft 
Strike down this chief, whoe'er he be, that thus 
Is making fearful havoc in our host!" [Iliad, V, 196. 

The bow of Pandarus, with its accompaniments, and the operation of 
shooting JJiomedes, are thus described : 

Straight he uncased his polished bow, his spoil 
Won from a mountain ibex, which himself, 
In ambush lurking, through the breast had shot, 
True to his aim, as from behind a crag 
He came in sight; prone im the rock he fell, 
With horns of sixteen palms bis head was crowned. 
These deftly wrought a skilful workman's hand, 
And polished smooth, and tipped the ends with gold. 
He bent, and resting on the ground his bow. 
Strung it anew. * * * 
His quiver then withdrawing from its case, 
With care a shaft he chose, ne'er shot before, 
Well-feathered, messenger of jiangs aud death, 
The stinging arrow fitted to the string. » * * 
At once the sinew to the notch he drew; 
The sinew to his breast and to the bow 
The iron head; then when the mighty bow 
Was to a circle strained, sharp rang the horn. 
And loud the sinew twanged as toward the crowd 
With deadly speed the eager arrow sprang — it struck 
Just where the golden clasps the belt restrained, 
And where the breast-plate, doubled, checked its force. 
On the close-tittiug belt of curious workmanship 
It drove, and through the breastplate richly wrought 
And through the coat of mail he wore beneath, 
His inmost guard, and best defence to check 
The hostile weapon's force; yet onward still 
The arrow drove. [Iliad,' V. 119.

killed iu that battle, B. C. 490. It was excavated by Fiaurois Lenor- 
mant, aud bis report was published.' A great number of bronze arrow- 
heads were found, short, barbed, socketed, and with three facets. 

Flakes of black flint were also found, which were thought by some 
to have served as arrowheads, but this has been combated aud is doubt- 
ful. They were all the same type and did not resemble any known 
standard of arrowhead. They were but fragments of an irregular tri- 
angular form, 1^ to li inches in size, and curved at the x)oiut. M. Leuor- 
mant is clearly of the opinion that these were not of Greek origin. 
The black flint is almost unknown in Greece, aud he suggests that 
they might have been used by some of the Persian archers. But even 
this is doubtful, for we know that bronze and iron arrowheads were 
used at that period by the Persians as well as by the Greeks. The 
latter had used them in the days of Homer (figs. Ii4, 25). 

The knowledge of bronze is believed to have come from the East, and 
if so, would have been known in Persia even before it became known 
in Greece. It is doubtful if they were arrowheads at all, but if they 
really were it is much more likely they belonged to the Persian allies 
than to the Persiaus themselves. The Scythians and Parthiaus, coming 
from the direction of Persia, were the most celebrated archers of the 
known world, and had bronze, if not iron, arrowheads. History helps 
us iu the view that these stone arrowheads, if they were such, did not 
come from Persia, nor from the East, but from Ethiopia — the far South. 

Herodotus ^ described the arms of the various peoples forming the 
army of Xerxes. Most of them had the bow and arrow, but stone 
points were used only by one people. 

The Persians * * * iiail short spears, long bows and arrows made of cane 
* * * and under them their quiver hung. * » * 'i^ji© Indians » '' * imd 
bows of cane and arrows of cane tipped with iron. * ^ * The Bactrians had bows 
of cane, peculiar to their country. * * » The Parthians, Chorasmians, .Sogdians, 
Gaudarians, and Dadicfc had the same as the Bactrians. The Caspians, .Savangif, 
and Pactyes had bows of cane. * * * The Arabians carried at their right sides 
long bows which bent backward. The Ethiopians carried long bows, not less than 
four cubits, made from branches of the palm tree, and on them they placed short 
arrows made of cane; instead of iron, tipped with stone, which was made sharp and 
of that sort on which they engrave seals. * * * They had javelins tipped with 
antelope's horn made sharp like a lance. 

The Scythians and the rude tribe of MassagetiB used bronze arrow- 
heads in the time of Herodotus, who records^ how that one Ariantas, a 
king of the Scythians, took the census of his people by requiring each 
one to contribute an arrowhead, the whole of which he put in the melt- 
ing pot and cast into an enormous bronze vessel.^ 

Our modern discoveries point toward bronze and iron having come 
from the Orient, and getting into Egypt and Ethiopia later than into 
Assjrria or Asia Minor.

unknown country lying- between and to the south of tlie P>lack and Cas- 
pian Seas, has been lately subjected to critical archa'ologic researches.' 

Metals were there early discovered and put to use. But few locali- 
ties found by the explorers show occupation in the Neo- 
lithic period pure and simple. Knowledge of brou/e and iron 
dates to altnost the earliest times. It is strongly claimed by 
de Morgan that Armenia was the seat of a very early, if not 
the original, discovery of iron. When he approximates the 
appearance and use of iron in connection with bronze in that 
country to a period twenty to thirty centuries before Christ, 
and shows that iron was in common use there long before 
it was in the adjoining countries, it will be seen what good 
ground he has for his assertion. The author knows well 
that M. de Mortillet has assigned to Africa the place of 
discovery of iron, and this may be correct. He does not 
argue the proposition ; it is aside from his 
present purpose. He is endeavoring to 
show the probability that the Ethiopian 
flint arrowheads in the army of Xerxes 
came rather from Africa than Asia, and 
that in the latter country stone as a mate- 
rial for arrow and spear heads had been 
superseded by metal — bronze and iron. 

De Morgan^ describes swords, pon- 
iards, lances, hatchets, bows, and arrows. 
He says that there were found in the 
cemetery of Redkine lance heads of both 
bronze and iron, in the cemetery of Lelwar 
those of iron only. They were practically 
the same type, the blade long and narrow 
in the form of a willow leaf. They all had 
a projecting rib running longitudinally 
through the center to strengthen it. They 
were furnished with a socket in which the 
shaft was inserted and one or two holes for 
nails to fasten it. Of course the handle 
was decayed and lost, but in a few cases re- 
mains were found stuck in the socket which 
enabled them to suppose it had been of ash. 

These iron lance heads varied greatly 
in size, form, and fashion. Figs. 29 and 

30 are from the cemetery of Mou^i-yeri; fig. 20 is 4 inches long 
and 2| inches wide; fig, 30 is 25 inches long. The former blade is

long" and narrow, while the latter is short and broad. Figs. 31-38 
shows eight of these iron lance heads, all from the cemetery of Chei- 

tau-thagl). 

The variations of these spear- 
heads show them to have been 
the product of individual de- 
sign and iiianufact nil', and that 
they were not made by a ma- 
chine or after a single pattern. 
They are all socketed; the 
socket is not solid, but open 
on the side, showing they were 
hammered and not cast. The 
sockets were not welded nor 
brazed. Whether they could 
weld or braze two pieces of iron 
together must be left uncertain. 
It may, however, be considered 
certain that they knew of and 
employed a heat sufficient to 
weld, and used it in the manu- 
facture of these implements, 
for without a welding heat they 
could not make these sharp 
edges and points. On one of 
the Egyptian bas-reliefs (at 
Medinet Abou, Thebes, twenti- 
eth dynasty) aThyrenien war- 
rior is shown with two spears 
as though one might have been 
for throwing as a javelin and 
the other for hand to hand 
combat. 

There was a series of knives 
of iron from the cemetery of 
Cheitan-thagh, Armenia. The 
handles had been of wood, 
bone, or horn, fastened much 
the same as the butcher or car- 
ving knife of modern times. 
Some had a tang inserted in 
deer horn, some had pieces of 
bone, others pieces of wood cut 
thin and laid on both sides, riveted through. The IJ. S. ISTational Museum 
possesses a series of the latter obtained direct from M. de Morgan which 
is represented in the accompanying photographic plate (Plate 1).

the form and use of the bow ami arrow in that locality at that period. 
Tlie bow was longer than a innn was tall. It was not regular in its 
form, as are most bows. It consisted of three curves, the center being 
the smallest and shortest. The drawings (figs. 39, 40) show the form. 
These forms may have been exaggerated by the ancient artist, but they 
are our only source of knowledge. From the scenes depicted elsewhere 

ou the cinctures, it is concluded that 
these bows served for the chase as well 
as for war. 

Chips and tlakes of obsidian, few in 
number and irregular and uncertain in 
form and from the mountains of Alla- 
gheuz, were found by de Morgan, which

he thinks may have been used as arrowheads. The author may be 
permitted to doubt the generality of such usage — he would not deny 
isolated or sporadic cases. 

The arrowheads found were of bronze or iron (figs. 41-45, ) and were 
of curious forms, some socketed, some stemmed, some with long, fine 
barbs, others leaf-shaped. Some were arranged with a stem or tang to 
be inserted in the shaft (figs. 42, 43), others had a socket in which the 
arrow shaft was to be inserted, and a small hole was provided with a 
nail or point to fasten it (figs. 41, 44, 45). Some had a curious barb, more 
the appearance of a nail or spur, springing from the socket, which had

A few of the imi)lements

in the cemetery of Mou(^*i-

curious to remark that 
while the bronze and iron 
arrowheads of this period 
and locality are the gen- 
eral form of chippedstone 
arrowheads of prehistoric 
times, those of chipped 
stone — that is, the obsid- 
ian specimens — are of a 
new and almost unknown 
form, ruder and more ar- 
chaicthan found elsewhere.

III. SUPERSTITIONS CONCERNING ARRO\A/^POINTS AND OTHER 
PREHISTORIC STONE IMPLEMENTS. 

AntiqnUii of this supcrsfition an evidence of their long disuse as 
u-eapons — Elf darts or idfchcs^ arroirs — Pierre de foudre, pierre de 
tonnerre^pietra dufiioco — Amulets — Xo superstition concerninf/ arroir- 
heads in America — Used hii Indians as weapons and only occasionally 
as charms. 

The superstitious regard for stone arrowpoints and the belief in 
their su})ernatural origin, in most Oriental and European countries, is 
inconsistent with the knowledge of, or belief in, their huniau manufac- 
ture for use as arrows. 

Xo people, however primitive or ignorant, having an object in (com- 
mon use, known by them to be of human manufacture for utilitarian 
purposes only, will regard it with superstitious reverence or accept it 
as having a heavenly origin or supernatural power. That these arrow- 
points, with other objects of similar age and origin, have been so 
regarded by the people of the Oriental and. European countries is easily 
demonstrated. 

The superstition concerning the polished-stone hatchet and the stone 
arrowpoint has existed all over Europe and a large portion, if not all, 
of Asia and Africa; and these objects have been, and in many places 
still are, regarded as of a heavenly origin and as having supernatural 
powers. While this superstition usually belonged to the peasantry, 
there were many educated persons who believed it. Like the belief 
that the fossil animals found in the rocks were bits of broken stars 
fallen from the skies, until their true character was discovered by 
Leonardo da Vinci and Bernard Palissy, there was no way of account- 
ing for them. So when in the nineteenth century prehistoric man was 
discovered, these stone implements were immediately recognized as his 
work, and the belief in their supernatural character began to die out. 
Of course, a tradition as old, as widespread, and as firmly believed 
among the peasantry, who read little and traveled less, would natu- 
rally be slow to yield, and so in certain localities and with certain 
peoples its remains are yet to be found. They have been (tailed 
"lightning stones" and "thunderstones" in many languages. These 
names are frequently ai)plied to both the stone hatchet' a7id the arrow- 



' Descriptions <anfl figures of these are given in the author's paper ou Prehistoric 
Art, contained in the report of the U. S. National ^[nseuni for 1896, pis. .34-37, figs.

point, though in some hx-alities a difTcrcncc is lecognized and th(^ hitter 
are called "elf darts," etc. 

It is no uncommon thing to hear older i)easants in rural districts in 
France deny all knowledge of stone hatchets or arrowpoints or spear- 
heads, for the sole reason that they do not recognize the objects by 
these names. Let one ask for pierre de foudre or pierre de tonnerre, 
and he Avonld receive an aftirniative answer at once, (lonseiller For- 
nier, of Rennes, tells of a peasant wlio ])ossessed one of these stone 
implements that he had seen come from the heavens in a Hash of light- 
ninj;-. It struck in a neighboring field and, on his going to the i)hxce, 
he found the hole from which he extracted this implement still hot, 
and he had kept it ever since. 

The belief is that these objects are protection against fire, especially 
lightning, and they are kept as protective amulets, some of the hatchets 
being drilled, while the arrowpoints are set sometimes in silver, some- 
times in gold. When thus arranged they are more or less ornamental 
and are intended for j^ersonal use, though occasionally they are hung 
at the bed head, or near it, to guard the owner during sleep. The 
undriiled ones are placed about the house, inserted in any ledge in the 
stones of the fireplace, on or over the mantel, or in a crack near the 
door. 

The terms elf bolt, elf shot, or elfin arrow are applied throughout the 
Scottish lowlands to the flint arrowhead. The Gaelic name, sciathee, 
is sjnionymous. In Shetland and Orkney the same idea, suggested 
there by the corresponding term, thunderbolt, is more frequently 
api)lied to the stone hatchet. 

The elf arrow continued until a recent period to be esteemed through- 
out Scotland as a charm against the malice of elfin Sjiirits and the 
spells of witchcraft. Sewed in the dress or worn on the person it was 
available for the i)rotection of the individual, and is occasionally to be 
met with perforated or set in gold and silver, to be worn as an amulet. 

The collection of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland contains an 
"elf dart" set in silver, which has been worn as an amulet. A flint 
arrowhead forms the central pendant of a Greek or Etruscan gold 
ne(;klace in the British Museum. Like other weapons of elfin artillery, 
it was sup])osed to retain its influence at the will of the possessor, and 
thus became the most effective talisman against elfish malice, witch- 
craft, or the evil eye. It is popularly believed when cattle are sick 
that they have been stricken by these fairy or elfin weapons.

breast, as they report, which is called the elf's arrow. The cattle doc- 
tor feels the animal over and over and does not fail to find one or more 
elf darts in tlie skin. These are placed in water, which is given the 
creatnre to drink, and the cure is, of course, speedily effected. 

Pennant,' after referring* to the cure of cattle bewitclied by elf shots 
by making- them drink the water in which an elf arrow has been 
dipped, adds: 

The same virtue is said to be found in the crystal gems and in tlic adder stone; 
lor that reason the first is called clach bhuai, or the powerful stone. Capt. Archi- 
l)ald Campbell showed me one, a spheroid set in silver, for the use of which people 
came above a hundred miles and brought the water it was to be dipped in with 
them, for without that in human cases it was believed to have no eftect. 

Pejjys records, on the authority of Dr. Hicks, a circumstantial story 
of elf arrows with which Lord Tarbut entertained the Duke of Lauder- 
dale, and he adds : 

I remember my Lord Tarbnt did i)roduce one of these elf arrows, which one of 
his tenants took out of the heart of one of his cattle that had died an unusual 
death. 

The feats of the witches of Auldearn furnish some of the most mar- 
velous narratives in Pitcairns's Criminal Trials. Among other disclos- 
ures, they describe a cavern in the center of a hill where the archtiend 
carries on the manufacture of such elf arrows with the help of his 
attendant imps. The latter perform the preparatory work, shaping 
the crude blocks and chipping the arrows out of the flint flakes, after 
which they receive from the master fleud their finishing form and point. 

In Ireland flint arrowheads were regarded as potent spells against 
the influence of witchcraft and the evil eye, an elf arrow being fre- 
quently set in silver and worn about the neck as an amulet against 
being elf-shot. 

We can not err in assuming that at the earliest period of the North- 
men, exercising an influence in Scotland sufficient to assimilate the 
popular superstition, the period to which the flint implements pertain 
was only known as a state of society so different from the historic 
traditions with which the people were familiar, that they referred its 
weapons and implements to the same invisible sprites by whose agency 
they were wont to account for all incomprehensible or sui^erhuman 
occurrences. And we may infer from what all other evidence confirms, 
that the close of the Scottish stone period belongs to an era many cen- 
turies i)rior to the oldest date of the written histor\^ of the country. 

This ancient superstition is not i)eculiar to Scotland and Ireland. 
In Norway, diseases, not only of cattle but of men, were called by the 
name "alfshot," and in Denmark, "elveskud" — that is, elf-shot — though 
the flint arrowpoint is not recognized there as the bolt which furnishes 
the quivers of malignant elves. But other, and probably more ancient 
Scandinavian legends prove the existence of similar northern associa- 
tions with the i)rimitive arrowpoint. 

' Journey in Scotland, I, p. 115. 



844 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 18^7. 

The iianie still applied to the elf bolt by the ]!!^or\vegian peasantry is 
"toideiikiler," or thuiulerstoiie, so that we can feel little hesitation in 
assijiiiing- to the old Norse colonists of Orkney the difference still dis- 
cernible in these expressions of the same popular idea. In the Fornal- 
dar Sogur Nordlanda, or legends from the primitive period of the 
north, derived from ancient manuscripts, Orvar Odd's saga furnishes 
a curious evidence of this. The hero, who is already furnished with 
three iron arrows, the gift of Ouse, a Finnish king possessed of magic 
power, is hospitably entertained in the course of his wanderings by an 
old man of singular a])pearance. 

Oil the side where the old )uaii sat he laid three stone arrows on the tabh' near the 
dish. They were so large and handsome that Orvar thonght he had never seen any- 
thing like them. He took them up and looked at them, saying: "These arrows are 
Avell made." " If you really think them to be so," replied his host, "I shall make yon 
a present of them." " I do not think," replied Orvar, smiling, "that I need cumber 
myself with stone arrows." The old man answered: "Be not sure that you will 
not some time stand in need of them; I know that you possess three arrows, the 
gift of Guse, but, though you deem it unlikely, it may happen that Guse's weapons 
will prove useless; then tliese stone arrows will avail you." Orvar Odd accordingly 
accepted the gift, and chancing soon after to encounter a foe who by like magic was 
impenetrable to all ordinary weapons, he transfixed him with the stone arrows, 
which immediately vanished. 

The Danish collector, Olaf Worm, describes^ the chipped flint spear- 
heads and daggers as being of doubtful origin, and that some persons 
regard them as thunderbolts. 

Even in Japan flint and obsidian arrowpoints are regarded as the 
weapons still in use by spirits. The popular belief is that every year 
an army of spirits fly through the air with rain and storm; when the 
sky clears the people go out and hunt in the sand for the stone arrow- 
heads the spirits have dropped. Dr. Jannsen states that the Japanese 
keep ancient stone implements in their chapels, treating them with 
religious veneration. According to Dr. Schwaner, ancient stone 
hatchets are still more carefully preserved by the present inhabitants 
of Borneo in bags woven of cane and suspended in the recesses of 
their dwellings among their talismans and amulets.'^ 

This variation in the jfopular mode of giving expression to the idea 
of a supernatural origin for these primitive weapons is worthy of note 
from the deflnite evidence it att'ords of a period when stone weapons 
were as much relics of a remote past and objects of popular wonder 
as now. 

The collection of amulets made by Professor Belucci of Italy, shown 
in the Paris Exposition in 1880, contained the following, which had 
been worn or kept as a protection against fire and lightning: Polished- 
stone hatchets, jadeite lo, serpentine 12, aphanite 2, lydite, quartzite, 
and argillite, 1 each — 32; arrowpoints or spearheads, flint 30, pyrites 
4, calcite 1 — 41 ; total, 73. 

The superstitious belief in these objects is not confined to any par-

tic'ular place or country. It is e(inally prevalent in Germany, France, 
Italy, Spain, and Portugal. In Brazil these objects are called "corsico,"' 
but it is possible this may be only a name brought over from Europe 
by the couquistadores. In Italy they are called ''pietra di fuoco,'' in 
France "pierre de tounerre" or "pierre de foudre," in Spain "piedra 
de fuego" and "piedras de rayo." 

A belief in the sui)ernatural origin of stone arrows and hatchets is 
as common in China as it is in otlier i)arts of the world." 

The collection of M. Van de Poel, of 39 prehistoric objects from Java, 
was presented by him to the Academy of Sciences, Paris. "The 
si)ecimens were obtained with difiiculty, as the natives regarded them 
with religious veneration.''-' The Malays call them "gigi guntur'' (teeth 
of the lightning). 

This supernatural character has been recognized more or less among 
all peoples as far back as history goes. Sir John Evans* says: 

Enough, however, has been said with regard to the superstitious attaching to these 
arrowheads of stone. The existence of such a belief in their supernatural origin, 
dating, as it seems to do, from a comparatively remote period, goes to prove that 
even in the days when the belief originated, the use of the stone arrowhead was 
not known, nor was there any tradition extant of a people whose weapons they hud 
been. 

In Greece, as early as the time of Pliny, the stone arrowpoints, along 
with polished-stone hatchets, were believed to have fallen from the 
stars. The latter were called "astropelchia" or thunderbolts. Pliny, 
quoting Sotacus, says there are two sorts, "the black and the red, say- 
ing they do resemble halberds or ax heads. Such as be found withal 
are endued with this virtue, that by means of them cities may be 
forced and whole navies at sea be discomfited.'' 

Aldrovandus^ engraves a Hint arrowpoint as a fossil glossopetra, a 
stone which, according to Pliny," "resembleth a man's tongue and 
groweth not on the ground, but in the eclipse of tlu^ moone falleth from 
heaven," and which "is thought by the magicians to be verie neces- 
sarie for those that court fair women." 

In the catalogue of the museum at Gresham College ■ they are called 
"anchorites," because of their likeness of form to an anchor. Kefer- 
ence is made to the collection of similar objects in the Worm Museum. 

Flint continued to be used in some parts of Egypt until the. twelfth 
dynasty, 2600 B. C. Mr. Flinders Petrie in 1889 excavated the ancient 
settlement Medinet Kahun, the pyramid of Unserteseu II, and there 
found and brought back to London, where they were exhibited at 
Oxford Mansion, a bushel or more of Hint chips and wrought flakes.

846 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

Some of the Hakes were inserted in a wooden sickle and made the cut- 
ting; edge of the implement, while the flakes were many of them 
wrought (all done by chipping) into spear or lance heads. The author 
purchased a number of both kinds, and they are now exhibited in the 
U. S. National INfuseum (plate 4). 

Sir John Evans' reports a chipi>ed-flint arrowpoint fastened to its 
shaft witli bitumen, displayed in the British Museum, found in an 
ICgyptian tomb. The dynasty and consetjuently the date is not .niven; 
it may not be known. 

This extended and universal superstitious regard for these imple- 
ments as a class is incompatible with their use as "wea])ons by the same 
l)eople, and the antiquity of the superstition demonstrates the autujuity 
of their desuetiule. 

This superstition never attached to these objects in America, for 
Avifch its discovery came also the discovery that the objects heretofore 
regarded as supernatural and of heavenly origin were naught but the 
tools and weapons of savage man. Following this discovery by the 
white man, came the other discovery by the Indian — that his imple 
ments and Aveai)ous could be made more easily and (juickly of metal 
than of stone, and straightway the use of stone for this purpose was 
superseded by metal. 

Lieutenant Niblack, LI. S. N., in his "Indians of the Northwest 
Coast," ^ remarks: 

Ou the iutrodaction of iron, which l)oth Cook and Dixon uttribntu to the Russians, 
the Indians were not slow to adapt it to their purpose. Dixon saj'S that in Captain 
Cook's time iron implements were then also in use among the Tlingit and Haida. 

And on page 200: "For salmon spears * * * steel is now gen- 
erally used." 

On the advent of the white man, the making of arrowpoints or spear- 
heads of stone i^ractically came to an end among our North American 
Iiulians, even though they remained savages. They soon found that a 
rejected and broken barrel hoop or other piece of strap iron would make 
more arrowheads than w'ould a hundred times its weight in flint, with 
less labor and in shorter frime. Not only were they more easily made, 
but were lighter; as ammunition they could be carried in greater number, 
and were in every way more etfective as a weapon. Neither the epoch 
of transition from stone arrowpoints to those of iron, nor the length of 
time in making it, by the North American Indian, can be told Avith 
accuracy, but wc may be reasonably certain that he would not long 
continue to make them of stone after he had the material and the tools — 
that is, the strap iron and a flle or chisel — and the knowledge to use 
them. The Indian traders soon discovered the Indian needs, and after 
beads, glass, and tomahawks, the cargoes contained iron and some- 
times flies and chisels by which the arrowpoints and knives could be 
made, if they did not carry the arrowpoints and knives already made.

ARROWPOINTS, SPEARHEADS, AND KNIVES. 847 

This may not have begun with the first moment of contact with the 
white man. The first Indian trader may not have taken iron arrowpoints 
or the material or tools with which to make them, but we may 
fairly conclude he did soon after. These materials took rank in impor- 
tance to the Indian with, if they did not precede, the glass beads and 
brass rings which have been the proverbial currency of Indian traders. 
There must necessarily have been a period of transition; stone arrow- 
points would not be supplanted instantly by iron. 

Doubtless there were exceptions to the generality of their nse. Boys, 
ainatenr hunters, degraded tribes, those living far back in the moun- 
tains, even hunters or warriors moved by necessity or the desire to save 
expense, may have made stone arrowpoints or spearheads after general 
contact with the white man. 

Rev. M. Eells, in the Stone Age of Oregon,' says stone arrowpoints 
and spearheads are scarce, and that he had seen only nine of them in 
eight years' residence among the Indians. The Indians did not make 
them ; they used bone. But as evidence that they were used in ancient 
times, he says that Mr. Stevens has 3,200 of them, 6.} inches by 2 J 
inches, down to one-half by one-fourth inch. He had found a grand 
cache of them unearthed at Oregon City, A workshop for making 
arrow and spearheads had been discovered at Umatilla Landing, with 
the usual nuclei, hammers, chips, and flakes, with arrowpoints and 
spearheads complete, incomplete, and broken, in abundance. 

Mr. J. G. Swan, speaking of the Indians of Cape Flattery,- says: 

The bow is used principally by the boys * " * to kill birds and other small 
game; as a weapon of defense it is scarcely ever used, firearms having entirely super- 
seded it. * * * Tiie arrowheads are of various patterns; some arc made of iron 
wire, which is usually obtained from the rim of some old tin pan or kettle; this flat- 
tened at the i)oint, sharpened, and a b;irb tiled on one side, and driven into the end 
of the shaft; a stri^i of bark is wound around to keep the wood from splitting. 
8om(! are of bone [of course the head is of wood, the same as the shaft] ; * * * 
others again are reguhirly shaped, double-barlted, and with triangular heads of iron 
or copper, of very neat workmanship. 

Lieutenant Niblack, U. S. 'N.,^ speaking of the Indians on the north- 
west coast, says : 

To-day the l)ow and arrow survives only as a mpans of dispatching wounded game 
or to save powder and ball. * * * Few bows are now seen among tlies(» Indians 
except as toys for the children. Before the introduction of irou, arrowheads were 
of bone, flint, shell, or copper. 

And on page 285 : 

The primitive dagger was of stone or bone. The first daggers made by the natives 
after the advent of tlio whites were from large, flat files, and the skillful maimer in 
which these were ground into beautiful fluted daggers challenged th(^ admiration of 
the traders, Avho found the work as skillfully done as if by European metal-workers.

And the same reiuaik is iiuule on ])iige -J88 in rej^ard to seal spears. 

Not only was stone su]>erseded by iron as a material for arrowpoiuts, 
but the bow and arrow as a weapon was superseded by firearms. As 
this was a greater change, so the i)eriod of transition might have been 
longer, but that it would come sooner or later was inevitable. The 
(piestion of civilization has but little to do with the adoption of a better 
weapon. The wildest Indians in North America, having all the belong- 
ings of savagery, might have, within the past twenty-live years, been 
seen armed with magazine or breech-loading guns as fine and good as 
those of our army moving against them. These Indians and their 
guns represented the two extremes of civilization. The Indian was the 
lowest stratum, his gun the final effect of enlightenment in man. 

Capt. John G. Bourke, of the United States Army, an accurate and 
close observer, an interested archaeologist, a noted Indian fighter who 
was in that service during the principal part of his life, and a valuable 
aid and comrade of General Crook in some of his most celebrated 
Indian campaigns, gave a sketch of the weapons, tools, implements, 
domestic ntensils, amulets, etc., of certain tribes of Indians as they 
were when he first met them, in a paper read by him before the 
Anthropological Society at Washington, under the suggestive title of 
"The Vesper Hour of the Stone Age." ' As resulting facts of his 
observations, in the twenty-three or twenty-five years of his service, 
since his first acquaintance with the wild tribes of the Kio Grande, 
the Gila, and the Colorado, he has seen them "not only subjected to a 
condition of peace, but notably advanced in the path of civilization, 
their children trained in the white man's ways, and all traces of ear- 
lier modes of life fast fading into the haze of tradition." Doubtless 
the North American Indian had his myths concerning the arrow. 
But these are cpiite difterent from the superstitions in the Old World 
concerning the arrowhead; those were based on the belief in the 
sui^ernatural origin and power of the object, and were inconsistent 
with its character as a wea|)on. The myth in America might relate to 
the arrow as a charm or for divination, to find lost objects, search for 
game, etc., but it in no wise affected their knowledge of its having 
been made by man, to be used as a weapon. 

On the subject of arrows as charms or amulets. Captain Bourke 
says ^ that all the American aborigines used stones as amulets. And 
he says instances of throwing arrows and stones "for luck" are given 
by Koss, Mackenzie, Castaneda, Picart, and Gomara. As to the 
myths of the arrow, he refers to Bancroft, Torquemada, Bascana, and 
others, and says : ' 

Arrows fired under (urcumstances of special uote, those which had once killed ene- 
mies or in the hands of the enemy had failed to kill the present owner, became tal-

iamaTis, and wt>re worn attached to his belt, bow, or hat. Two or three arrowlieads 
were appended to the necklace of human fingers, whicli I secured in a fight with the 
Cheyennes of northern Wyoming during the Avinter of 1876, and now deposited in 
the National ilnaeum. The information obtained in regard to these was alwaj^s 
vague and far from satisfactory. 

With the wonderful penchant of the North American Indians for 
mystery, and their delight in superstition; with their belief in "medi- 
cine,''' the power and influence of their shamans and medicine men, 
and the necessity of the latter to successfully impose on their follow- 
ers, it would be curious if the shamans had not attributed magic 
power to some of these objects. With all his experience, Captain 
Bourke is able to give but two instances where anything supernatural 
has been attributed to the arrowpoint, and these were, as he said, 
vague and unsatisfactory. 

An Apache squaw who claimed great skill as a midwife was in the 
habit of administering a pinch of powdered arrow in water in cases of 
painful gestation or protracted labor. She explained to him that 
whenever lightning hap])ened to fell a pine tree on the top of a high 
mountain, the medicine man would hunt for any rock at the foot of the 
blasted trunk which would yield lire when struck. He saw one of 
these medicine arrows in the possession of an Indian woman in the 
pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico, in 1880, and the owner acknowledged 
its uses to be identical with the same amulet of the Apaches, but 
refused absolutely to dispose of it.' 

The manufacture and use of stone arrowpoints undoubtedly continued 
much later in the western countries of the United States than it did in 
the eastern, because that country was discovered later. It is not 
unlikely that there may have been Indians in the wilder countries who, 
in cases of stress, continued to make and use these implements into 
comparatively modern times. But ''comparatively modern" is only a 
relative term. All our knowledge relating to modern savagery in 
America dates from contact with the white man. This contact is the 
line between the historic and the prehistoric. Prior to that period of 
contact the white man, who was the historian, had no knowledge of the 
Indian or his history or customs, and from that moment both his history 
and customs began to change. 

It would follow that, unless falling within the exceptions mentioned, 
the common arrowpoints and spearheads in the Museum and other col- 
lections in the United States are practically prehistoric. Those from 
the East are admitted without question to be so, but they are no more 
so than those from the West. The discoveries and conquests of the 
Indians in the West by the whites are nearer our own times, and this 
accounts for the principal differences in our oiiinions. Contact between 
the Indian and the white man was the first step; the second was the 
obtaining of Indian lands by purchase or war, and the third was sub- 
jugation. This process jiroceeded faster in the West than it did in the

East, and, as a consequence, tlie transition from savagery to civilization, 
from prehistoric to historic, from the bow and arrow to the ride, has 
been correspondingly faster in the West than in the East. 

IV. FLINT MINES AND QUARRIES IN WESTERN EUROPE AND IN 
THE UNITED STATES. 

As all arrowi)oints, spearheads, and knives, except a few of siate, 
were chipped or flaked into shape and used in that condition, the pre- 
historic man would naturally seek a material which had the recpiisites 
for such working. Flint and its kindred (the liner being chalcedony, the 
coarser chert and hornstone), obsidian, jasper, quartz, and quartzite 
were the principal substances. Obsidian is comparatively rare, and 
the last three were more or less refractory and would be used only when 
the better material could not be obtained. Flint was the best. It com- 
bined the greatest desiderata with the greatest facility of procurement, 
and was consequently the favorite material of prehistoric man during 
the polished-stone age, in Euro])e as well as in America. Of the 203 
specimens of arrowpoints, spearheads, or knives shown in Plates 35 to 
47 of this paper, 144 are of flint, chalcedony, oi' chert. These are all 
silicates of a crystalline structure, almost all cryptocrystalline. Flint 
can be chipped in any direction. It breaks with a conchoidal fracture, 
and can be struck oft' in long, straight, even, and thin flakes. It is tough 
and hard, holds a sharp edge and point, and is not difiicult to work. 

(Quarries or mines of flint in dift'erent parts of the world were known 
and were worked in prehistoric times. The author proposes to describe 
some of the more important, preferring those which he has visited 
and inspected, using them as illustrations of others which will be only 
named. Associated with these mines or quarries are workshops where 
the various implements were numufactnred. He also proposes to com- 
pare some of the mines or quarries and the material of Europe with 
those of the United States. 

EUROPE. 

Spiennes, Belgium. — Spiennes is a hamlet in the neighborhood of the 
city of Mons, in the province of Hainault, It is on the railway from 
Mons to Charleroi, and the station is Ilarmignies, the first after leav- 
ing Mons. 

The author had the honor to be United States consul at the city of 
Ghent, in the province of Flanders-Oriental, which adjoins that of 
Hainault on the north, and so had opportunities of frequent visits to 
Mons, which is the center of an extensive mining district, i)rincipally of 
coal. He formed the acquaintance of M. F. Cornet, a civil and mining 
engineer. M. Cornet, with his colleague, M. Briart, made the report 
upon the prehistoric flint quarries and workshops in the province of 
Hainault to the International Prehistoric Congress at Brussels in 1872. 
The members of that congress made an excursion to this locality. 
There were two objects of interest; one was the prehistoric flint quar-

the surface for twice that

that have beeu more or less

pation in prehistoric times.

of these pieces, which he de- 
posited iu the Prehistoric

pieces was by Albert Toil-

The discoveries of Toilliez 
attra(;ted the attention of 
students and caused further 
investigations,which in 1860 
resulted in the discovery of 
the mines of flint, and that 
they had been worked by 
prehistoric man, and that

came in modern times to be 

exploited for the manufac- '^ ^^'z ^ i*i

way the excavations of an 
ti(|uity were frequently en- 
countered. In 1867 the con- 
struction of the railway from 
Mons to Charleroi was begun by the way of or near to the little town 
of Binche. The construction of the railway required a deep cutting 
through the plateau between the river De iSTouvelles and La Trouille. 
On this plateau were located the flint mines of Spiennes. The locality

of the Paleolithic occupation at Mesviii is to the west of the river 
De IS^oiivelles, between it and the river Le By. A portion of the 
railway cut through the Neolithic flint mine at Spiennes is shown 
in fig. 48. 

Messrs. Cornet and Briart and M.Houzeau de Lahaye were charged by 
the scientific society of Hainault to supervise the excavations of the 
railway for evidences of i>rehistoric man. They rei)orted several con- 
clusions, that which interests us being that the men of the i)olished- 
stone age had dug pits or mines into the great chalk and clay deposit 
to obtain flint nodules for the manufacture of their tools and weapons, 
and that extensive and important work had been done in these mines 
in times of antiquity. 

The railway cut brought to light within its area no less than 25 of 
these pits. The cut extends about 40 feet below the surface of the 
plateau, which was fortunate, for it thus showed the i)rehistoric mines 
to their entire depth. These mines, as shown in fig. 49, were in the 
form of pits or shafts. The shaft was sunk from the surface perpen- 
dicularly through the clay and sand until it reached the chalk. The 
shafts were 2, 3, and 4 feet in diameter, longer than wide for facility in 
working, and the deepest was about 3<) feet. Arrived at the chalk, 
galleries were thrown ofl:' horizontally in searching for the nodules of 
flint. The galleries were from 20 to 6J feet in height, and from 3,3 to 9 
feet in Avidth. An enlarged view of one of these shafts and mines shows 
its corresponding gallery pushed to the right and left, through the 
chalk, in search of the nodules of flint therein contained. There are no 
means of determining the number of these shafts, nor the number or 
extent of the galleries, without an extensive system of trenching through- 
out the plateau, which would be too expensive; but a fair idea can be 
gathered of it when it is said that the entire surface of the plateau is 
dotted witli the filled shafts. They are found every few rods. If one 
digs beneath the surface but little more than the depth of the plow, he 
will find an ancient shaft. Several of them have been excavated to the

earth, filled in and natural, render them recognizable with certainty. 

In fig. 50 the shaft communicated with the surface by an opening 
shown on the right. Whether this was natural or artificial was unde- 
termined. The debris with which it was filled represented everything 
met with in the exploration. It was a confused mass of sand, lime, 
blocks of chalk, chips, flakes, and nodules of flint, with the bones of 
different animals, pieces of pottery, and not infrequently implements 
of bone, deer horn, and flint. 

The mouths of these shafts were usually broken away around the 
sides, giving them somewhat the form of a funnel. But this was only 
for a short distance down, when the sides or walls of the pit becjame 
perpendicular (figs. 51, 52). 

The pits and galleries were sometimes caved in, but usually they

insight into the domestic and indnstrial life of this people by examin-

and cast away, were flint i)ieks, flint flakes and points, deer antlers, 
and in the workshops were pieces of the knives, hatchets, arrow- 
points, and other implements broken in the course of manufacture — 
the "failures'' of the workmen. 

The tools used for mining- were sharp picks of flint similar to cores 
tigs. 7, 8, 9, and flakes figs. 3, 4, 5, G (Plate 5), probably held in the hand 
while digging, and picks of deer liorn, one of the palms forming the 
handle and a prong forming the pick, such as were found at Grimes 
Graves by Canon W. Greenwell (Plate 6). There was no evidence in 
the galleries of the making or sharpening of these implements, and it 
was believed that this was done at the surface; nor were there evi- 
dences of the means of ascent and descent, nor yet that of lifting out 
the flint. 

The entire plateau has been leveled during all historic time. The 
holes or funnel-shaped excavations which had formerly existed were

filled up, and the fields had been cultivated for centuries. There was 
nothing about its appearance to indicate its wonderful condition. The 
owner, the farmer, the i)lowu]an, and the hunter, all had passed over 
its surface from the earliest historic time without any knowledge of 
what lay beneath the surface, except as they derived it from the chance 
finds of worked flint and pottery fragments. Prior to the discovery of 
prehistoric man, this debris told no story and conveyed no idea. After 
thediscovery of i^rehistoric man, and when wise persons became observ- 
ant and sought for the evidence of his existence in the chips, flakes, 
and nuclei, broken and worked in every degree of manufacture, this field 
became a volume of evidence. During the visit of the International 
Arcbaeological Congress from Brussels in 1872, its members spread 
themselves over the field and gathered every morsel which showed evi- 
dence of human Morkmanship with much tlie same assiduity as the 
miner in his search for gold. This Hold has always been an attraction to

students of preliistoric artiba'ology, and has been visited by the leading 
authorities of that science of Europe. There lias been no restriction by 
theowner of the land upon the carrying away of as many pieces of flint 
as the visitors may desire, and this permission has been used to a surpris- 
ing extent. Yet when the author visited this field ten and thirteen 
years afterwards, pieces of worked flint were apparently in as great 
profusion as in the first instance. The search of a single afternoon over 
its surface secured such a number of these specimens that he was 
unable to carry them, and a peasant was employed to transport them 
to the railway station. So numerous were the evidences of prehistoric 
human industry, that despite the great desires and long-continued 
eftbrts of the farmer to rid his field of these stones, yet in many places 
they constituted, for a depth of 2 or 3 feet, a large proportion of the 
earthy material. The photographic idate of samples (Plate 5) gives a 
fair idea of the commoner objects, such as broken hatchets, cores, picks, 
hammer stones, scrapers, and flakes. 

Cornet and Briart are both dead, but their places have been taken by 
Baron de Lot' and M. de Munck, who have continued the work, and the 
author was fortunate enough to have heard, at the International Prehis- 
toric Archaeological Congress in Paris, 1889, their joint paper describing 
the continuation of their investigation and the discoveries of the work- 
shops supplied by flint from these mines. It was the opinion of these 
observers that the material had been divided up at the pit's mouth and 
carried to dift'erent workshops in the neighborhood, there to be manu- 
factured into implements. The theory was advanced that these Avork- 
shops had been sijecialized so that only one kind of implement was made 
in each shop or by each workman. The investigations showed that 
there had been a division of labor, and that each workman or each 
band of workmen had been confined practically to the manufacture of 
a single class of implements. 

The hatchet was the principal implement, yet there were all kinds of 
scrapers, i)icks, arrowpoints and spearheads, and flakes in great num- 
bers, probably intended for use as knives. These were in all stages of 
manufacture, from the rudest chipping to the finished (Plate 5). The 
hatchets were only chipped to proper form ready for polishing. 

The structure of flint is such that it is better worked by chipping 
than l)y pecking. Granite and kindred material is wrought by peck- 
ing or hammering, but flint by chipping. In European preliistoric 
workshops most of the rough work was by chipping and not by peck- 
ing or hammering. The workshops are to be traced by the chips and 
refuse, and closer investigation showed them probably to have been 
huts, which may also have served as habitations for the workmen. 
There were depressions in the surface, and the ground was pounded 
hard, as though it had been for a floor. These observers thought they 
could, in some cases, discover the evidence of the wooden material of 
which the hut had been built. The workshops all occulted high and

coinniaudiug positions, raany of which, never liaving been cultivated, 
were unchanged from the times of antiijuity, and so furnish excellent 
evidence of their prehistoric occupation. 

It wns the opinion of Baron de Tjoi' and M. de Munck that the flint 
implements made in the workshops of the neighborhood had been the 
foundation of an extensive commerce, by which they had been distrib- 
uted over southern Belgium and northeastern France. M. de Munck 
had found l."> Neolithic stations, extending over 45 communes, all in 
direct relation with Spiennes, creating a network of roads which had 
remained in use until modern times. 

(rvand Prrsfiii/uy. — Grand Pressigny, in the department of Indre-et- 
Loire, France, a few hours' ride southwest of Tours, is the center of a 

district rich in flint, 
wliicli was much util- 
ized during the Neo- 
lithic period. 

There was no mine 
proper, but an exten- 
sive workshop for the 
manufacture of flint 
implements (Plate 7). 
The debris still en- 
cumbers the ground 
for miles around to 
such exeut as to im- 
pede cultivation, and 
furnishes flint for the reparation of the road and for buihling puri)oses. 
Many of the neighbcn-ing houses have been built either with founda- 
tions or first stories of the flint nodules. The parapet of the bridge, 
on which Ave pass over the stream into the town, is of flint. The cores 
are most plentiful and are called, from tlieir color and shape, "livres 
du beurre," pounds of butter (Plate 7, fig. 3). They have been so 
wrought as to enable the workmen to strike off, sometimes one, some- 
times three, flakes of remarkable length, 12 to 10 inches (Plate 7, fig. 4). 
These flakes may have been used as knives, but the}' were many times 
worked into spear or lance heads. Here also was a division of labor, 
for in certain workshops these flakes alone would be found; in others, 
notably the hamlet of Epargne (Philippe Salmon), the peculiar saws 
or scraiters notche<l in the end were to l>e procured (fig. r>3). But the 
remarkable thing about it all was the great demand in prehistoric 
times for these spearheads and knives and the extensive commerce they 
commanded. Because of its peculiar yellow or waxen color, the flint 
of Grand Pressigny is easily recognizable, and so can be traced in its 
migrations through 27 departments in northern, western, and central 
France, and even into some of the lake dwellings of Switzerland. 
Specimens of it have been found iii the dolmens, associated with some

M. Cartailliac^ sbows the working: of these mines. He says galleries 
were carried in all directions irregularly. At the point where the fliut 
was most plentiful and where they were to be engaged for the longest 
time, they left certain ])ortions of the earth to serve as pillars of supjiort, 
as is done in coal mines at the present day. The prehistoric miners 
took great i)recaution against accidents; they filled all cavities and 
interstices after they had taken out the Hint, to the end that there 

should be no caving, but 
there were no traces of 
shoring up with timbers. 

Notwithstanding all this 
care, Boule and Cartailhac 
found evidences of (;aving; 
for example, the imple- 
ments of deer horn were 
found crushed by the fall- 
ing of some portion of the 
roof which had not been 
properly supported. The 
strokes of these picks of 
the workmen were plainly 
visible on the walls of the 
galleries. Occasionally one 
could findtheijointsstillin- 
crusted in the rocks where 
they had broken off. The 
miners had kindled tires in 
the galleries and used the 
heat to break up the blocks 
of flint to facilitate their 
extraction and transport. 
Some of them bore evidence 
of the cords and strings 
which had been used in carrying them. These prehistoric mines were 
brought to view by the opening of alimestone quarry. The mine is shown 
in fig. 54:, and one of the deer-horn picks is represented in fig. 55.

It is cited here to show how these discoveries of mines, quarries, and 
workshops are being (iontinued. If more earnest search were made, 
more mines and workshops woidd be discovered. It has come to be a 
canon in archa^ologic hxw, recognized in France, that the evidences of 
prehistoric man are to be found, not in proportion as they exist, but in 
proportion to the number and activity of tlie seekers. The nodules of 
flint at Champignolles were in the clialk and were mined and worked 
into implements. Twelve i)its were found, of which nine were excavated 
and exposed. A section 
is given (fig. 57) which 
will sufficiently explain its 
condition. 

Grimes Graves, Bran- 
don, Sujf'oll', England. — 
These are flint mines or 



quarries, celebrated un- 
der the ancient name of 
Grimes Graves and in 
modern times under the 
name of Brandon. They 
have been worked for hun- 
dreds of years to make 
guuflints and strike-a- 
lights. There are similar 
manufactories in many 
places in Europe. Be- 
sides Brandon, flints are 
made at Ichlington, Suf- 
folk, at Norwich and Salis- 
bury, England; at Meus- 
nes, in France, and at 
Cero, Italy. In former 
times the business was of 
such importance that in 
France exportation of the 
products of certain mines 
was prohibited by law. 
In the later days the de- 
maud has fallen away so as to have become insignificant, yet Brandon 
leads the world. The strike-alights are continued in use by peasants 
and laborers, and by explorers and travelers in semicivilized countries. 
Sir John Evans visited Brandon in 180() and Mr. James Wyatt in 1870, 
both of whom have described the mines.' At those periods there were 
twenty or thirty persons engaged in the business. The raw material 
costs, for mining, royalty, cartage, etc., about $2,50 a ton, and manu-

factnred flints sold at about $1 a tliousaud. The price the author 
paid for strilve-a-ligbts in Bologna was 1 cent apiece. In Paris the 
tiiut was arranged with steel and cotton soaked in some chemical, 
possibly saUpeter or chloride of potash, for tinder, the complete article 
costing 00 cents (fig. 58). The gunfliiits of commerce were divided into 
23 classes, according to size and shape as they were required for differ- 
ent arms. In tlie palmy days of the flint makers they were packed 
for export in half barrels, each containing U,OUO nnisket, 3,000 car- 
bine, or 4,000 pistol flints, the weight of each being about the same, C5 
to 70 ])oiinds. Their manufacture required some skill and handicraft, 
although it is soon accpiired. There is great difierencc reported in the 
rapidity of the workmen. 

The working of the Brandon Hint mines bas continued into modern 
times for the manufacture of gunHints. The i)rocess of nmking them 
has been described at length in various works.' It will be sufficiently 



I 




understood by Plates 8-10, which show the princii)al operations. Sir 
John Evans says skilled workmen at Brandon could make from 10,000 
to 18,000 a week, and that the average weekly output was from 200,000 
to 250,000 for 20 men. In Ilees's Encyclopedia,- it is estimated that one 
a minute was the average for a good Avorkman. That would make the 
extreme weekly ])roduct of 20 men but 72,000. 

The U. S. National Museum possesses a series of nodules, crudely 
and partly worked, from Brandon, showing the entire operation. 

The Grrimes Graves quarry was investigated by Canon (Jreenwell, of 
Durham Cathedral, in 1870, and bis report is published in the Transac- 
tions of the Ethnological Society for that year (p. 419). 

The (puirry covered about 20 acres and consisted of shafts or pits 
partly tilled, now formi^ig funnel-like depressions, 254 in number, 20 to 
GO feet in diameter, dispersed over the surface but sometimes so close 
together as to break into one another. It required much work to 
reexcavate them. The shafts or pits chosen by him were about 30

of an inferior quality, and the pits continued until they reached the 
best tiint in the chalk. The first surface of earth stratum was some 
18 feet thick, which might account for the inability to make perpen- 
dicular walls or i^its as at Spieunes. As at Spiennes, they drove hori- 
zontal galleries into the chalk which here were about 3.J feet high. At 
Spiennes, the digging tools were principally flint points (Plate 5, figs. 
7,8,0) and flakes; here they were red deer horn, of which about 80 
were found by Canon Green well (Plate (3). The points of these were 
worn as picks, and the bases were battered by use as hammers. Canon 
Greenwell says the marks orthe deer-horn picks made by digging were 
yet plainly visible in the chalk. A hatchet of basalt had been thus 
used and made its marks at Grimes Graves. The author saw corre- 
sponding marks in the hard clay in the Etruscan tomb (del Colle Cas- 
succina) at Chiusi, and made a drawing of them, represented in fig. 59, 
which will serve as an illustration of those at Grimes Graves and else- 
where. The deer-horn pick handles at Grimes Graves were worn 
smooth by the hands of the workmen, as are pick handles at the present 
day. The roof of one of the passages had caved during the absence 
of the workmen, who had left their tools, two deer-horn picks, appar- 
ently at the close of the day's work (Plate 6). Here they were found 
by Canon Greenwell during his excavations, and the coating of chalk 
dust on one of them retained the print of the man's hand. *'It was a 
most imi)ressive sight," he said, "never to be forgotten, to look, after 
a lapse of three thousand years or more, upon a piece of unfinished 
work with the tools lying about as though the workmen had just gone 
to dinner or quit work the night before." ^ 

Sir John Evans enumerates the various tools, implements, and debris 
found in the fillings in the shafts and galleries and on the surface in 
the immediate neighborhood; cores, chips, and flakes of flint, quartzite 
and other pebbles used as hammers, hatchets, scrapers, borers, and 
arrow and spear heads, some of them more or less rude, some broken, 
and in all stages of progressive manufacture. 

Prof. W, Boyd Dawkius- says the surface was covered by innumer- 
able splinters and implements in every stage of manufacture, from the 
nodule spoilt by an unlucky blow to the article nearly finished and 
accidently broken. There were as at Flint Ridge (Plate 13), little 
heaps of small splinters which marked the places where the finer work 
was carried on. In some of these the two halves of broken implements 
were found Just as they had been tossed aside by the workman (Plate 
11, fig. 7; Plate 14.)

the same appearance as those at Flint Ridge. The excavations in fig. 61 
show what has been suspected long before — that these pits are deep, 
going down through the chalk to the bottom of the flint deposit, and were 
thence carried in horizontal galleries as in all mining under similar

In all prehistoric iiiiiics and workshops throughout Europe tools and 
domestic utensils, Hint or horn picks, chips, flakes, traces of charcoal, 
hammers, partially made and broken hatchets, and other implements, 
as sawed horn and fragments of pottery, are found (Plates 5, 7, 11),

and are evidences of human occupation. If man worked in one of 
these places for any length of time he used his tools for his work, and 
domestic utensils for his cooking and living, and they were broken or

come to be expected by the motleru investigator, and are found wher- 
ever prehistoric man occupied the locality for any length of time. 

In Eees's Eiicycloi)edia' it is said that the best tiint found in France 
iu modern times is that from the departments of Cher, Loir-et-Cher, 
Ardeche, Yoniie, and Oise. M. de Mortillet has discovered in the 
department of Vienna no less than 44 Neolithic workshops, and in 
liidre-et-Loire 0, M. Philippe Salmon reports i^rehistoric workshops 
in 14 communes in the department of Yonne. Tliis number would 
undoubtedly be much increased if attention were given to the search 
and if all found were reported. Siiecial workshops have been found 
where particular implements were exclusively numufactured. De 
Mortillet reports- hatchets chipped for polishing from Mariettes at 
Londinieres (Seine-Inferieure), Olendon (Calvados), Forrt Othe (Yonne- 
et Aube); i)erforators, Kemours (Seine-et-Marne); arrowheads, Camp 
de Chassey (Saone-et-Loire). While arrowheads are in profusion in 
the latter locality, it is not certain that they were manufactured there. 

The following mines have been found wherein scrapers were the 
special product: liOche-au-Diable, Potigny (Calvados), Charenton 
(Seine), Camp-Barbet, Meudon, Janville, Mouy (Oise), (roalenec, 
Quiberon (Morbihan). Of the latter the author asks indulgence for a 
few words of description, as he was present with M. Gaillard and 
assisted at the discovery. 

Scraper tcorJcshop at GoaJenec, Quiberon {Morbihan), France. — It was 
on the extreme i^omt of the i)romoutory of Quiberon, on the west coast 
of Brittany, looking out upon the Atlantic Ocean, but which English 
geograi^hers have arbitrarily called the Bay of Biscay — a high rocky 
point, level with the surrounding surface, but 40 or 50 feet above the 
water. It was severed from the mainland by a crevice a few feet in 
width, passable only at low tide. The entire mass was of granite rock. 
It was covered with a layer of soil which was nearly bare on the sitle 
toward the ocean, having x^robably been denuded by the waves, but on 
the inside edge was oh feet thick. Beginning at the outside edge, 
screening, examining, and throwing the dirt behind us, bits of broken 
and wrought flint and fragments of pottery were soon found. We 
saved everything. Our work continued across the point until we had 
thousands of objects, principally scrapers in all stages of manufacture. 
It was a prehistoric scraper workshop. The peculiarity of these 
scrapers was their diminutive size; many, i^erfectly finished, were no 
larger than a man's thumb nail. At the edge farthest from the ocean, 
where the soil was deepest, we unearthed the skeleton of a workman, a 
man of middle age, he who jirobably had made these prehistoric imple- 
ments, who had here lived and here died, and had been buried in his 
workshoi) and habitation, which was from that time deserted, and now 
discovered and unearthed by us.

In addition to the skeleton the following objects were found: Three 
polished- stone hatchets of diorite, entire; 14 hatchets, fragments, unfin- 
ished; 7 pendants of stone; 3 beads, talc; 3 chisels, hatchet (?) of dio- 
rite; 5 flakes, flint; chamfered polishers, schistose diorite, unique; 1 
briquet, " strike-a- light," iron pyrite;' 4 sinkers, scrapers in all stages 
of i^rogress, many of them finished, aud hammers of various kinds aud 
styles. There were divers tools, ornaments, domestic objects, etc., not 
necessarily connected with scrapers or their manufacture. They were 
the objects used by the workmen while engaged in their duty. 

The author took for his share such objects as he desired, and has had 
photographed a series of them (Plate 12). Observe that on the left are 
the finished and on the right the unfinished scrapers. 

UNITED STATES. 

Flint Bidge, lAcking County, Ohio. — This is probably the most exten- 
sive aud the best known of all prehistoric flint quarries in the United 
States. It is on a high, level jilateau on the road, equidistant between 
Newark, Licking County, and Zanesville, Muskingum County, Ohio, 
lying partly in both counties (Plate 13). Its ridge is about 8 miles 
east and west and 2i north and south. The outline of the plateau 
is exceedingly irregular. The surface of the country has been greatly 
eroded, the streams having cut down about 300 feet below the original 
level, washing deep ravines, which run up into the plateau with steei^ 
banks, leaving high, jutting points of land. The covering earth of the 
plateau is alluvial — clay, shale, etc. — and lies directly on the stratum 
of flint. The stratum of flint dips to the southeast, as do nearly all 
formations in eastern Ohio, while the surface of the plateau holds 
about the same level. The top of the flint stratum at the western end 
is 3 or 4 feet beneath the surface; at the eastern it is 8 or 10 feet, and 
the layer itself is from 4 to 7 feet iu thickness throughout the plateau. 

Mr. Gerard Fowke describes the geology of Flint Eidge as follows:^ 

In the geological scale this flint is continuous with the ferruginous linustone of 
southeastern Ohio, and is highly fossiliferous in some places. In the museum of the 
State University is a very fine nautilus embedded in a piece of buhrstoue from this 
place. Other smaller fossils occur abundantly both in this aud the more solid flint, 
particularly Fusulina cylindrica, a small foraminifer found in great numbers in Europe 
at a corresponding horizon. Very frequently, however, the fossil, being calcareous 
in its nature, lias disappeared, and only the matrix remains. 

Underneath the flint lies the Putnam Hill limestone of the Ohio survey, so named 
from a high hill opposite Zanesville, where it is well shown. The upper part of this 
limestone is shelly, sometimes closely approaching a thin sandstone in its appear- 
ance, and of a yellow cast; farther down it becomes more solid and takes on a blue 
color. 

The flint, from its great resistance to weathering agencies, forms the cap rock of 
the whole ridge, the superincumbent material being for the most part either clay or

soil resulting from the disintegration of the shales and sandstones which formerly 
existed at this horizon. The natural place of the Kittanniug co;il of the Pennsyl- 
vania series is 15 to 20 feet above the level of the flint, but it runs out before reach- 
ing this far west, at least there is no trace of it here. These beds of bituminous 
coal lie at different levels in the hills; 104 feet below the flint is a workable seam 
of cannel coal. A section of the formation in the eastern jtart of Licking County 
shows the same alternation of sandstone, shale, clay, coal, limestone, and iron ore 
that is found in all coal regions, so that a detailed statement of its geological struc- 
ture is unnecessary. 

Mr. Fowke describes the variations of the flint as follows:' 

At I e extreme western end it is of a gray, whitish color, cellular or porous in 
structure and conmionly called buhrstone, and in the early occupation by white man 
had been quarried for use as millstones. I'y the oxidation of the included iron it 
shows shades of yellow brown along the line of fracture. Half a mile e.ast aj)pears 
the translucent and bluish variety ; still the buhrstone predominates. Two miles 
farther east, while the bed rock retains the bluish cast, the surface specimens Ity 
weathering show every color known to flint — white, black, brown, yellow, green, 
and blue. 

At the intersection of the crossroads, the Clay Lick Station road, the well dig- 
gers report the flint as translucent and light-blue. A few hundred yards to the 
north it is nearly white; the same distance south it is nearly black. These varie- 
ties are found in other parts of the plateau and finally finishes at the extreme 
eastern end with the same buhrstone that it commenced. In the crevices are fre- 
quently found quartz crystals. They are of every size from microscopic to that of 
a hen's egg, and of every color from limpidity to almost black. 

The flint was found to be in a continuous stratum, not in nodules. 
It may have had fractures and faults, but was practically a solid mass 
from 3 or 4 to 7 feet thick (in one place it was only 29 inches), with an 
area 8 by 2.i miles. The central portion only was worked, except some 
scattered diggings on the east in Muskingum County. The worked 
area was about 2 miles square, and was covered with clay and soil to 
a depth of from 4 to 8 or 10 feet. 

The prehistoric mining is believed by Mr. Fowke, who has examined 
it with great detail and thoroughness, to have been conducted in the 
following manner: 

The clay and soil covering was removed by digging and carrying up 
on the level. This digging, continued down to the layer of good flint, 
naturally made a pit with sloping sides like an inverted cone, with its 
point resting on the flint layer; the point would be more or less trun- 
cated according to the width of the excavation, which was from 15 or 
20 feet up to 60 or 80 feet. In some places these pits were so close 
that they ran together and the earlier was partially filled with the debris 
from the later. Many have been filled with soil, leaves, etc., and, 
having retained the rain water, are now filled with muck and become 
veritable marshes; in others the water is more or less pure and has 
been used for watering cattle. 

The flint being laid bare in the manner indicated over a greater or

870 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

less area, Mr. Fowke's belief is that the preliistoric man was unable to 
(quarry or break pieces or blocks of tiiiit suitable for use off the solid 
layer at his feet, and that he proceeded by the use of Are and water 
alternately to erode a hole or pit through the hint. Arrived in this 
way at the bottom of the layer of Hint, he then broke out from the face 
of the flint wall and threw away such pieces as had been affected by 
the fire, until good flint was procured, which was taken out for use. 
The i)rocess was continue*! until the quarrying was interfered with by 
the superincumbent earth. Why this was not excavated wider and the 
quarrying continued against the face of the rock, instead of what 
seems to have been the practice, opening a new pit through the clay, 
and a new hole through the flint, has not been explained; but that he 
conducted his operations in the latter manner and not the former 
seems established. Mr. Fowke says:' 

In Cosliocton County, near Warsaw, are some similar pits which have been reopened 
by residents of the locality. In them were found two layers of flint, the upper a 
dark variety, the lower a clear, translucent kind of cl)akedony. This lower flint 
seems to have been the kind sought. Traces of fire were plainly visible in the pits, 
from which the inference is natural that fires were built upon the rock, and that, 
while heated, water was thrown on it. The stone could thus be broken into pieces. 
In the bottom of the pits were found bowlders of granite, syenite, and other glacial 
rock, which plainly showed that they had been used as hammers. No doubt a simi- 
lar plan was followed at the ridge. 

Similar hammers were found at Flint Ridge, and there is in the U.S. 
National Museum a series of a hundred or more, varying in weight from 
G ounces to 20 xwunds. The smaller hammers were found distributed 
over the surface at the workshops where the raw material was carried 
to be worked into implements. Mr. Fowke is of the opinion tliat there 
were at Flint Ridge two kinds of workshops, one for the ruder work of 
blocking out the implements, and the other for the finishing; and he 
assigns this division of labor to eight localities for each, all on the 
plateau of the ridge. Without expressing an o[)iuion as to the correct- 
ness of this division of workshops, the author can testify that some 
localities of the neighborhood were strewn with ruder and heavier 
material, while others had a profusion of small and fine chips, flakes, 
and debris, evidently the product of the finer finishing work. The 
latter localities were mostly on the high blufts or points of land over- 
looking the valleys below, and from which position one could see far 
over the adjoining country. On these points the flint chii)s, flakes, etc., 
were in such jirofusion as, in some cases, to prevent the grass forming 
a sod. The author chose one of these spots and dug it out 10 by 12 
inches and 14 inches deep to the bottom of all flint debris. He then 
washed out the earth. The flints were 7 inches deep and the earth 7 
inches, half and half. The flints from this hole were brought to the 
U. S. National Museum. The accompanying plates (14 and 15) show

This quarry was the largest in that portion of the United States. 
The investigations show it to have been used during the later prehis- 
toric ages and that it was the center of an extensive commerce. The 
peculiar appearance, variegated color, brilliancy, etc., of its products 
enabled their nngration or commerce in prehistoric times to be traced 
and the objects to be recognized whenever found. 

There were many mines and quarries in the territory now the United 
States which furnished material for aboriginal stone implements. 
Some of them may have continued to be used by the savages in more 
modern times, but most of them are entirely prehistoric. It is needless 
to describe them, but the reports of their discoveries have been col- 
lected and are published for the convenience of students. They form 
part of Appendix A (p. 961). 

CACHES. 

The only method possible for the savage to preserve property left 
behind him on his departure was to secrete it, and this was usually 
accomplished by burying it. This custom prevailed among the pre- 
historic peoples of Europe as well as of America. By what name the 
savage called this deposit is not known, or if known is not used. In 
English it has been called deposit, hoard, etc., but the most popular 
word is the French one of cache. It signities concealment or hiding, 
and was first employed in America by the early French Canadians, the 
coureurs du bois, being applied to a concealed or deposited hoard or 
supply, usually of provisions, in which sense it is used in many of the 
early histories and travels in Canada and the lake regions. 

In forming a cache or hoard of implements, no general or uniform 
method was followed, but they have been so deposited as to show 
intentional placement. Usually they are in a circle, and may be laid 
fiat or on edge, sometimes on end. 

Keports of caches have been made by their discoverers, and for the 
convenience of the student these have been collected and are published 
in Api)endix B (p 97U). 

Implements of the leaf-shaped class have been found en cache, or

buried in the earth, aud have been called by some persons, "cache 
implements.'' M. de Mortillet names them generally Soliitreeii, after 
Solutre, the representative station of his third epoch of the Paleolithic | 
l)eriod, but specifically ho employs the name "feuille de laurier" (laurel 
leaf). In the classification of arrowpoints and spearheads (see p. 890) 
that form is assigned to ])ivision I, Class A. Caches, as will be seen by 
the list (Appendix B, p. 970), are not exclusively of these implements; 
therefore the term cache implements is not sufficiently definite and 
should not be employed. Caches have been found of the large chipped ai 
flints, "spades" or "agricultural implements,'' arrowi^oints and spear- 
heads of different types, grooved axes, polished-stone hatchets, scrapers, 
and other implements. 

Implements similar in material and identical in form with arrowpoints 
and spearheads have been found throughout the western and south- 
western United States, but which, from their large size, could hardly 
have served for arrows or spears. An implement one to three inches 
long M'e recognize as an arrowpoint, one four to six inches long as a 
spearhead; but Mhat shall we say as to one a foot or fifteen inches 
long? The U. S. National Museum possesses many of these specimens. 
They can not be ignored, and so have been assembled and reported in 
Appendix C (p. 982). 

V. MATERIAL OF ARROWPOINTS AND SPEARHEADS. 

Composition and structure — No jyractieal difference het ween the flint of 
Europe and that of the United States — Microscopic examinations. 

It has been shown that flint was the favorite material in prehistoric 
times for the manufacture of arrowpoints and spearheads and, indeed, 
for all chippedstone implements, and was used by prehistoric man 
wherever obtainable. Flint, as is well known, is a variety of quartz; 
the principal difference so far as concerns the chemical constituents 
arising from the impurities. Quartz, also much used in prehistoric 
times in the manufacture of arrowpoints, is pure silica. It is 810^= 
silicon 46.67, oxygen 53.33. Its hardness is 7 in the scale of 10, and 
specific gravity 2.6 to 2.7. James D. Dana^ divides quartz into two 
varieties, vitreous and cryptocrystalline. He divides the latter into 
the chalcedonic and jaspery varieties. The vitreous is distinguished 
by its glassy fracture, and the chalcedonic has a subvitreous or waxy 
luster and is translucent. These owe their peculiarities either to crys- 
tallization, mode of fabrication, or impurities. The commou impurities 
of quartz, Dana says, are oxides of iron, clay, chlorite, or other miner- 
als which produce opacity. 

Of the first variety, the rock crystal is the representative. It is pure 
pellucid quartz. But such varieties as rose quartz, smoky quartz, 
false topaz, and amethyst are produced in one or more of the ways

ARROWPOINTS, SPEARHEADS, AND KNIVES.

mentioned. The chalcedonic variety includes the finer and more beau- 
tiful chalcedony, agate, carnelian, onyx, etc., as well as the grosser and 
baser variety to which belong flint, hornstone, chert, etc. The jaspery 
variety contains aluminous matter, and its color, yellow or red, is due 
to iron oxides. The bloodstone and basanite (lydian stone) belong 
to this. 

Flint, free from impurities, has the same chemical composition as 
quartz, silicon combined with oxygen — silica. 

Differences may arise in crystallization. Flint is of cryptocrystalliue 
structure. Its color may be gray, shading through yellow, green, blue, 
and smoky black, or with tints of red, yellow, and brown, into chalce- 
dony. Its fracture is conchoidal, not splintery, internal surface dull, 
scarcely ever glistening. Alone it is infusible before the blowpipe, 
but loses its color and becomes opaque. It is homogenous, has no 
cleavage, splits in any direction, therefore is easy to chip, yet is hard 
and tough and makes a keen cutting edge which does not crumble. It 
Mas the material best suited to the cutting implements of the prehis- 
toric man and was preferred by him accordingl3\ 

It is deemed useless to make analyses, because the onl}- differences 
would be the number and amount of impurities, and these might differ 
Avith every locality if not with every specimen.

It has been stated many times by archieologic students and teachers 
that there was no true flint in the United States. But this is due to a 
difference of definition rather than of material. The flint of Europe, 
declared to be true flint, is represented as a concretionary deposit of

silica, of cryptocrystalline structure, made in a bed or layer of soft 
chalk in the form of nodules. But it is not necessary, in order to be 
flint, that it be in tlie form of nodules nor that they be deposited in 
chalk; for the tlint of Europe has been found in hard limestone in both 
nodules and str.ita. That found in the Jura Alps is deposited in strata 
in hard limestone and not in clialk. That at Spiennes was de])osited in 
the clay both in strata and nodules. That used in the Mentone caves, 
of which there were wagon loads, and that along the Riviera, is in 
nodules and in limestone. Tlie Hint mine at Mur de-Barrez (Aveyron) 
(fig. 54), opened by MM. Oartailhac and Boule, and the mine at Meudon 
(Oise) (fig. 56), discovered by Cuvier in 1822, confirms this view. These 
and other deposits, representing widely separated districts in France 
and others throughout Europe, show a general condition of flint depos- 
ited in strata as well as in nodules, and in limestone and clay as well 
as in chalk. These iieculiarities of formation are paralleled in many 
localities of the United States. The differences in the deposit, and 
consequently in the formation of flint, are shown in many places 
throughout Europe. Some of them have been described, audit it was 
necessary many other localities could be mentioned. 

The same is true of flint in the United States, whether it be fine 
under the name of chalcedony, or coarse under the names of chert and 
hornstone. James D. Dana says:' 

Flint occurs in nodules iu chalk: not nnfreqneutly the nodules are in part ohal- 
cedonic. Hornstone differs from flint in heing more brittle; it is often found in 
limestone. Chert is an impure hornstone. Limestones containing hornstone or 
chert are often called iherty limestones. 

Flint Ridge, Ohio (Plate 13) is a locality noted for its ledge deposit 
of flint, while the flint disks from Ohio and Illinois (Plates 02,63) show 
deposits to have been in nodules. Flint disks of the same general 
shape and of corresponding material have been found iu several of the 
western States. A cache at Beardstown, Cass County, Illinois, con- 
tained 1,500 implements, arranged in horizontal layers, separated by 
thin strata of clay. Another deposit, of 3,500 specimens, was found in 
Fredericksville, Schuyler County, Illinois. The largest of such nodules

Illinois, is of ovoid form and measures 1^ inches in length by Oi inches 
in width. 

The following excerpts from the report on the Pentamerous limestone 
of the Clinton group, by Prof. James Hall,^ sliows that flint exists both 
in strata and in nodules iu the indicated horizon and locality: 

On the Genesee River this rock outcrops on either side. In many places in Wayne 
and Monroe counties it contains nodules of hornstone which sometimes assume the 
form of chalcedony. This matter increases so ranch iu Orleans and Niagara counties 
tliat it forms thin layers alternating with the limestone. Associated with this chert 
are found silicitied fragments of shells and crinoidal joints. South of Modena thin,

irretrnljir layers of impure limestone with much hornstone. Same at Lockport, 
eastward (p. G',i). 

The first mineral is hornstone of the Pentanierons mass. This often passes into 
translncent varieties and forms little cavities lined with chalcedony (p. 67).

Thick-bedded dark or bluish-gray limestone with irregular cavities and often

Corniferous limestone. This rock is distinguished from the limestone below by 
the presence of hornstone in layers or nodules, etc. In Seneca County it is in regu- 
lar courses from 6 to 18 inches thick, usually separated by layers of hornstone and 
sometimes embracing tlatteiied nodules of the same, which have a surface as if from 
the crystallization of some mineral in the space between the two rocks. 

* * ^ # # * » 

In other localities these layei's of hornstone increase in number and thickness 
almost to tlie exclusion of calcareous matter, which from weathering leaves the iiorn- 
stone in jagged and irregular projecting points, and is locally caUed "chawed rock" 
(p. 162). 

On the west side of the Genesee its cherty characters are better developed than 
elsewhere. Between Caledonia and Leroy there are hundreds of acres literally 
paved with hornstone in small angular fragments or larger masses united by carbon- 
ate of lime (p. 158). 

The hornstone sometimes passes into chalcedony (p. 168). 

Dana' says: 

The hornstone of the Corniferous limestone is full of microscopic plants, orproto- 
phytes, from l-.500th to l-.")000th of an inch in diameter; and with them are sponge- 
spicules and teeth of mollusks.

The Cretaceous limestones in Texas * * * contain hornstone distributed 
through them, like the flint through the Chaliv of England. 

The impurities iu flint marked by different colors may be peculiar to 
certain localities. By them the prodncts of different mines have been 
traced through their sometimes long voyages in the hands of their 
prehistoric owners. The color of the flint from Grand Pressigny, near 
Tours, France, is that of beeswax; that from Meudon, near Paris, is 
nearly white; that from Spieunes, Belgium, is light-gray; that from 
Italy, especially from the southern part, has the lustrous brown of 
jasper and chalcedony. Of that from England, Grimes Graves is light- 
gray, similar iu appearance to that of Spiennes; Brandon is quite 
black; Cissbury is dark-brown, almost black, weathering out into 
chalky whiteness. 

Of the flint from the United States, that from Illinois is light-gray, 
weathering out to chalky-white, while that from Flint Kidge (which 
does not weather white) passes through the entire range of color from 
the waxy luster of brilliant chalcedony to the dull opacity of degraded 
chert.

The cryptocrystalliiie variety of quartz comprises a considerable 
list of minerals: Opal, agate, chalcedonj^, flint, chert, hornstone, begin- 
ning with the finest and purest and graduating down according to the 
relative impurities and differences in mode of combination. Changes 
in color run through the entire spectrum, and are due princii)ally to 
the presence of metallic oxides. Iron is chargeable with most of them, 
but green is credited by Dana to nickel, and purple to manganese. If 
there were no impurities or foreign matter in it, the flint would be 
nearly clear- white. 

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF FLINT. 

The author has shown that the rock called flint is found alike in 
America and Europe; that it occurs in the two countries in both 
nodules and strata, and in both is found in limestone as well as in 
chalk. He proposes to continue the examination by comparing the 
structure of the rock in the two countries, and to that end has caused 
to be made thin sections of the flint fiom several of the mines and 
quarries mentioned, and these subjected to microscopic inspection and 
description by Dr. G. P. Merrill, head curator of the department of 
geology in the U. S. National Museum. These sections have been 
enlarged by the aid of the microscoi)e, and are shown in the pho- 
tographic plates (16 to 22) duly identified, with the name, number, and 
locality. Accompanying them are Dr. Merrill's descriptions, Avhile 
Plates 23 and 24 show the original specimens from which the thin sections 
were taken, appropriately marked for identification and comparison. 

We have now shown that the chemical constituents, the kind of 
deposit, nodules and strata, in limestone and chalk, general appearance, 
mode of mining and of use were practically the same during prehistoric 
times in America and in Europe. If the microscopic examinations 
show the rock from both countries to be of the same cryptocrys 
talline structure, the ijrincipal, if not the sole difference being in the 
degree of purity (or, rather, impurity), the author ventures to suggest 
that there is nothing gained by making a distinction of names between 
the flint of Europe and that of the United States, and that the distinc- 
tion, if made, is so finely drawn p'^ to be impracticable for use by the 
archieologists who deal with the material. 

These microscopic sections have been i^resented so that their struc- 
ture can be compared and their similarity demonstrated: 

Plate 16, fig. 1, represents a specimen of flint from Brandon,^ fig. 2 
is from Grimes Graves, and fig. 3 from Dorchester, all from England. 

Plate 17, tig. 1, is from Havelse, Denmark; fig. 2 is from Mouy, 
Meudon, France, while fig. 3 is from Spiennes, Belgium. 

Plate 18, fig. 1, is from Grand Pressigny, France; figs. 2 and 3 are 
from Flint Ridge, Licking County, Ohio. 

' Specimen fig. 1, on Plate 16 (flint from Brandon), is modern. All others are pre- 
historic, at least ancient, specimens. 



EXPLANATION OF PLATE 16. 
Microscopic thin Sections of Flint. 

Fig. 1. Flint.' An extremely i5ne-grained aggregate of clialcedonic ])article8. The 
structure is cryptocrystalline, so fiuc that the optical properties of the 
individual particles can not be determined. Tliroughout this crypto- 
crystalline base or groundmass are scattered numerous small colorless 
polarizing particles and occasional segregation areas of the chalcedonic 
material in a coarser or more granular condition. Beyond this, the 
microscope sliovvs only minute amorphous yellowish and black particles 
which are presumably ferruginous and carbonaceous matter. Organic 
remains (spouge, spicula, and diatoms) were not specially sought for, but 
we find an occasional form in outline suggestive of a chalcedonic cast of 
the shell of a foraminifera. Section nearly colorless.

Fig. 2. Flint. Substantially the same as Cat. No. 139130, with the exception that 
the section shows a greater number of the spherical areas of radiating 
particles of chalcedonic quartz. No forms observed that can be identified 
with certainty as foraminifera.

the author in a prehistoric workshop at Dorchester, Dorsetshire, England, 
and came from one of the neighboring Hint mines.

EXPLANATION OF PLATE 17. 
Microscopic Thin Sections of Flint. 

Fig. 1. Flint.' Iu every way essentially similar to Cat. No. 139130. The segrega- 
tion areas sliow the chalcedonic particles more distinctly in the . fan- 
shaped or radiating forms characteristic of the mineral. 
(Cat. No. 101U57, U.S.N.M. Havelse, Denmark. Plate 24, fig. 9.) 

Fig. 2. Flixt. Slightly less uniform in structure than Cat. No. 99866, but other- 
wise essentially the same. These gregations of coarser particles are in 
the form of irregular strings and' spots, rather than iu oval areas as in the 
other specimens.

Fig. 3. Scrapers. Grouudmass of this rock is essentially similar to that of speci- 
mens Cat. Nos. 139130, 101057, from Brandon, England, and Havelse, Den- 
mark, respectively. An occasional grain of quartz may be distinguishable, 
but the only difference of note is a large amount of black amorphous 
impurities with which the rock is injected. The chalcedonic forms noted 
in Cat. No. 139130 as suggestive of foramiuifera are more abundant and so 
plainly defined as to leave no doubt regarding their nature.

EXPLANATION OF PLATE 18. 

Microscopic Thin Sections of Flint. 

Fig. 1. Flint.' This specimen difters from Cat. No. 100259, or Plate 17, fig. 3, first, in 
coarseness of texture, and second, in showing an abundant sprinkling of 
crystalline granules of ([uartz. The slide is made up of irregularly oval 
areas of chalcedonic particles, sometimes rendered almost opaque by fer- 
ruginous and carbonaceous impurities, the interstices being occupied by 
the material dift'ering only in degree of purity, the carbonaceous matter 
being confined mainly to the oval areas, the appearance being as though 
the interstitial deposit was made subse(iuently and under more favorable 
conditions (as regards purity). 
(Cat. Xo. 99008, U .S.X.M. Grand Tres.signy (Indre-et-Loire), France. Plate 24, fig. 8.) 

Fig. .2. PiXK ILIXT. This, like those from Europe, is mainly a compact crypto- 
crystalline mass of chalcedonic silica, with segregation areas of the same 
material showing the characteristic spherulitic and fan-shaped arrange- 
ment of the particles. In a few instances the slide shows small areas of 
granular crystalline quartz. The rock is injected with iron oxide sufficient 
to give it a reddish or yellowish tinge, and the foraminifera remains noted 
in the European specimens are quite lacking. 
(Cat. Xo. 98344, U.S.N.M. Flint Ridge, Licking County, Ohio. Plate 24, tig. G.) 

Fig. 3. Black flint. This slide differs from the last (Cat. No. 98344) mainly in being 
of finer texture and in carrying au abundance of muddy and opaque car- 
bonaceous matter which is not distributed uniformly through the mass of 
the rock, but occurs rather in blotches and streaks. The slide shows 
further numerous irregular sharply angular areas with curvilinear out- 
lines so filled with impurities as to be of a dirty-brown color, and which 
are wholly without action on polarized light, indicative of silica in an 
opalescent form. There are numerous elongated cylindrical bodies which 
are without action on polarized light, which are suggestive of something 
of an organic nature.

while it is composed mainly of chalcedonic silica, it has, under the micro- 
scope, an almost granular aspect, and carries, moreover, a large amount of 
calcite. There is very little true quartz, the larger granules and crypto- 
crystalline portions showing the optical properties of chalcedony. The 
most marked characteristics of the rock is the abundauce of calcite as 
above noted, and which occurs in the form of aggregate and minute irregu- 
lar particles as tine as dust, distributed throughout the entire mass of the 
rock, and also in well-defined rhomboidal crystals. Nothing of organic 
forms is recognizable. Qualitative test shows the presence of lime, 
alumina, and iron, as well as silica. /

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 



At tlie Paris Exposition of 18S() Dr. Ca])itan (lis])laye(l a series of 
stone inii)lementsin all stages of pi'ogress and approaching completion, 
together with the tools used in their manufacture. The possible method 
of making stone implements was discussed at the tenth session of the 
International Congress of Prehistoric Archu'ology of Paris in 1889. 
M. A. de Mortillet showed, with illustrations, the cracking and chipping 
of flint by the heat of the sun, exposure to the air, by fire, by i)ercus- 
sion, and i)ressare. Dr. Oapitan gave a practical demonstration of the 
methods emi)loyed. He used the hammer, with and without the inter- 
vention of a punch, by stroke, free hand, and on the anvil. The nucleus 
was the dc'bris, while the flake was the desired i)roduct. The flake, 
larger or smaller, once obtained, was subjected to secondary chipi)ing, 

by which it was made into 
the arrowpoiut, spearhead, 
or knife, according to the 
intention of the maker and 
the ])ossibilities of the mate- 
rial. This was done bj^ per- 
cussion or striking with a 
hammer either with or with- 
out the intervention of a 
punch, while the object is 
held in the hand or on the 
knee; by pressure with a 
flaker, and (for other imple- 
ments than arrow or spear 
heads) by hammering or 
l^ecking, and by grinding 
or polishing.^ 

Sir John Evans interested 
the International Congress 
of Prehistoric Archteology, 
held in Norwich, England, 
in 18G8, by nniking in its 
presence flint im})lements, both by pressure and percussion. At the 
meeting of the British Association in Aberdeen he showed specimens of 
the flint knai)per's work obtained by his son, Mr. Arthur J. Evans, in 
the town of Joannina, in the province of Epirus, stmthern Albania. 
Mr. Arthur J. Evans had met the old workman in the streets engaged in 
making the strike-alights for market, and after seeing him work, get- 
ting samples of his wares and njaterials, being shown the limestone 
plateau from which he obtained the flint nodules, Mr. Evans purchased 
the entire outfit, flint, tools, and all, and they were exhibited before the 
association. Afterwards the paper was read before the Anthroi)olog-

ing between a crossed nicol. No distinct crystalline forms, but breaking up 
as the stages revolve into irregular areas polarizing faintly in light and t 
dark colors. The properties are too obscure to be of determinative value. . 
Throughout this groundmass are scattered numerous irregular areas of I 
quartz, of feldspars which have crystallized in situ, and small shredaof I 
greenish mica. I am unable to satisfy myself regarding the petrographio 
nature of the rock, and can only suggest that it may be an argillaceous 
sedimentary which has undergone a certain amount of dynamic meta- 
morphism.

The methods of treating the nodule or block of flint by the use of the 

hammer (1) in preparing the nucleus, and (2) in striking ott' the flakes, 

have been shown in Plates S-10 and figs. 62-65, and described iu the 

making of gunflints at Prandon mine aiid the nuclei at Grand Pressiguy 

(Plate 7, tig. 1). By these de- 
scriptions, combined with the 
figure of a nucleus or core with 
the flakes «nce struck oft' and 
then replaced, the operation will 
be understood and the descrip- 
tions need not be repeated. Fig. 
64 shows one of these nodules 
from the Brandon quarry which 
has been chii)))ed into flakes, 
ready to be cut up into gunflints 
or arrow points. These tiakes, having been struck oft", are, in the 
engraving, replaced so as to show the process. Fig. 65 is a section 
of a flint nucleus, with several flakes in pro(!ess of being struck off. 

Plate 25 shows the cores. Hakes, and the finished arrowheads of 
obsidian as they are found in America. This nuiterial is of vol- 
canic origin and it is usually attributed to the liocky Mountain

ranges, thougli by commerce specimens have traveled great distances. 
Prof. W. K. Moorehead found about a thousand hirge and well- 
wrought obsidian spearheads and arrowpoints in the great mound on 
Hopewell farm,' Ross County, Ohio, which he has cited in The Anti- 
(juarian.^ 

The specimens shown in Plate 25, figs. 1 to 4, are cores of great size 
and beauty. The tlakes have never been replaced as in the case of the 
Brandon core just shown, but one can easily see that the mode of manu- 
facture was the same. They were struck off by a blow, and the con- 
choid of percussion is always to be seen on both the flake and the core. 
The arrowpoints and spearheads, leaf-shaped and stemmed, are samples 
of those of obsidian from the Pacific coast. Their chipping shows 
delicate workmanship.

The principal tool used by preliistoric man was the stone hammer 
(tig. 6G-7). Thousands of these have beeu found, and their distribu- 
tion extends over nearly the entire prehistoric world. They were hard, 
so as to stand the blows without breaking. Any sort of stone which 
l)08sessed the requisite condition of hardness and was of suitable size 
would serve the purpose. Bowlders of quartzite were not infrequently 
used and the periphery or prominent ends or corners frequently show 
the battered or pecked surface, the evidence of use. Many of these 
quartzite bowlders have a cup marking on the one or the other of the 
flattened sides, the precise purposes of which have never been sat- 
isfactorily determined. It lias been contended by some that they were 
indentations for the thumb and fingers, to assist in holding the hammer 
in the hand, but this theory has not been a(;cepted.

Mr. J. D. McGuire has i)iiblished the result of some experiments on 
the hammerstone.' 

In the inventory of tools the tiaker must not be overlooked. Many 
of these have been found. The Eskimos use those of ivory fastened 
to a handle (ligs. <»8-71). These were used for chipi)ing by pressure. 
The real prehistoric tlakers have been found. They were simply pieces 
of bone or horn, usually the i)oint of a deer horn, with sufficient length 
to insure a firm grii). The workman, having chipped his piece to proper 
form by percussion, desiring to bring it to an edge, took it iu one hand,

The art of the i^rehistoric flint chipper requires a high order of 
mechanical dexterity. Some of the specimens show marvelonsly line 
work — Ihikes so thin, wide, long, and regular as to extort our wonder 
and admiration. (Figs. 92, 151, from a mound near Naples, Illinois.) 

The flaking tools of Europe have never been satisfactorily determined. 
In the present condition the number of finely flaked objects is enor- 
mously out of proportion with the number of flakers found. Of those

implements found wliicli might have seiNccl lor this purpose, the num- 
ber recogni/ed and admitted as such is comparatively few. Some are 
of bone, some of horn, and others (strange to America) are of Hint. 
Dr. Capitan, in the display of the Ecole d' Anthropologic at the Paris 
Exposition in 1889, showed a bone flaker, and he described and figured 
it in the rei)ort of that display made to the minister of public instruc- 
tion. In the author's European collection are several implements of 
horn which probably served the same purpose. They are doubtless 
to be found in every collection. They 
are short, round, with a blunt point like 
one's little finger. This tool is usually 
of deer horn in its natural condition, 
long- enough to have been held in the 
hand, but is sometimes cut short, with a 
possible tang- as for insertion in a handle. 
Bone points are in every collection and 
are well known to every prehistoric ar- 
cha'ologist ; but they are sharply pointed 
as if for awls or perforators of skin or tex- 
tile fabrics. The foregoing is a different 
implement and could never have served 
as an awl. One could no more jjunch a 
hole through a i)iece of skin with one of 
these than he could with the point of his 
finger, which it so much resembles. The 
author is of the o[)inion that they may 
have served as tlakers. Tools similar in 
form are found of tiint. Sir John Evans 
calls them fabricators or flaking tools' 
(figs. 75, 7G). In France they have been 
called ecrasoirs, but M. de Mortillet pre- 
fers the name retouchoir, and says'^ that 
their extremities are smoothed by use. 
They served to flake by pressure (re- 
touch) the flint implements. This opera- 
tion had the effect of smoothing the ends 
of the involved implement. In Le Musce 
Prehistoriqtie (Plate XLV, figs. 411-418) are several of these imple- 
ments, chiefly from the interior of France. Sir John Evans' discusses 
these implements, but confesses his suggestions are by no means con- 
clusive, and closes with the hope that future discoveries may throw 
more light on the subject. He figures and describes several from 
England, and says they are well known, and in Yorkshire are called

"finger flints." His fig. .34(3 (p. 307) is from Yorkshire, and is liere 
reproduced a^s figs. 75, 7(). His description of it is that it is solid, syiu- 
nietrically chipped, of gray flint, and is curved at one extremity, with 
a view of adapting it for being better held in the hand. The edges, 
originally chii)ped sharp, have been slightly rounded by grinding, 
apparently with the same motive. The angles at the curved end have 
been smoothed, l)ut the other end is completely rounded and i>re- 
sents the worn, half-polished appearance characteristic of these tools. 
They vary much in the amount of workmanship tiiey display, some 
being mere flakes with the edges rounded by chii)ping, and others as 
carefully wrought into form as any hatchet or chisel. They vary in 
length from 2 to 4 inches. The rougher kinds are usually clumsy in 
their i>roportions, as if strength was an object, and they not infre- 
quently show a certain amount of abrasion at each end. 

Many earlj^ explorers have witnessed the operation of arrowi)oiut 
making among the North American Indians and have described 
it in greater or less detail. These reports have been collected for 
the convenience of the student and teacher and are published as 
Appendix D (p. 985). 

VII. SCRAPEPiS, GRINDERS, AND STRAIGHTENERS USED IN 
MAKING ARROW AND SPEAR SHAFTS. 

These implements play a part in the science of prehistoric arclne- 
ology of an importance quite out of i)roportioii with their appear- 
ance. 

Spear and lance shafts, to be effective as weapons, must be straight 
and smooth. If rough or crooked, their effectiveness is much reduced. 
True, the most i)rimitive spear made of a sapling, the point hard- 
ened by fire and left rough with knots and branches, might be a 
dangerous weapon in a hand to hand contest ;, but it would be more 
easily handled and more effective if made straight and smooth. For 
a javelin or arrow intended to be cast or thrown, either ])y the hand 
or with a bow, it is imperative that the shaft should be straight and 
smooth. 

Many of the arrow shafts of antiquity were of reed or cane, perhaps 
because reed and cane were more ijlenteous and more easily adapted. 
They were the right size, could be made the right length, were light, 
straight, smooth, and required but slight preparation for use. Still, 
these Avould ret^uire some straightening and smoothing, and to that 
end tools were required. 

In Europe the arrow-shaft scraper was used more than the arrow- 
shaft polisher or grinder; in America it seems to have been the 
reverse. In Europe, while polishers were used for many purposes, 
they seem not to have been much used on arrow shafts. 

The arrow-shaft scraper (Plate 20) is a tool for that special purpose. 
It is of flint chipped to a concave edge. The sijecimen from England

(fig. 1) comes from Yorkshire Wolds, and is taken from Sir John 
Evaus's Ancient Stone Implements, ' where it says: 

Tools of this kind are well adapted for scrapinj; into regiihir shape the stems of 
arrows or the shafts of spears, or for fashioning bono pins. 

The round-ended scraper, supposed to have served for s(;raping- 
skins, had a common form in Europe (Plate 12) and America. They 
may have been used for scrapino- arroAV shafts in either or both coun- 
tries, but of this we have no evidence save their plenteousness and the 
possibility of such use. Eskimos continueil the use of the round- 
ended scraper, inserted in either wooden or ivory handles, until mod- 
ern if not until present times. 
They have been figured and 
described by Sir John Lub- 
bock,- Sir John Evans, ^ and 
Dr. O. T. Mason. * 

But the scrapers with aeon- 
cave edge, for scraping ar- 
rows, are rarely found in pre- 
historic collections, nor are 
they reported among the In- 
dians of Xorth America. The 
U. S. National Museum pos- 
sesses some, but not many. 
They seem not to have been 
recognized or cared for and 
were not gathered by collec- 
tors. Eigs. 1-8 in Plate 2G 
are seven specimens inserted 
Ohio and Mississippi valleys.'' 

Dr. Charles Eau, in an unpublished manuscript, divided some arrow- 
making implements into arrow-shaft grinders and straighteners, though 
he admits that both might have been used for smoothing the shafts. 

Fig. 77 represents an arrow-shaft grinder, with a straight groove of 
suitable size, of compact chlorite slate from Cape Cod, INIassachusetts 
(Cat. No. 178G8, U.S.N.M.). As the stone is not at all gritty, the proc- 
ess must have been performed with the assistance of sand and water. 

Plate 27 contains specimens of what are supposed to have been arrow- 
shaft grinders. They are coarse sandstone, exceedingly gritty, and 
would serve the purpose well. The top is rounding or oval, the sides 
parallel, while the bottom is flat, with a groove in il, as shown in the 
specimen. The size is indicated by the scale. They are from ('herokee, 
Iowa. Similar ones have been found in other localities. 

Somewhat allied to the arrow-shaft grinders are the arrow-shaft 
straighteners — more or less carefully prepared stones, generally of

obloiiji' form ami exhibitiiii? on the upper face a groove, or sonietiraes 
two or three parallel grooves, for receiving the arrow shafts (tig. 78). 
The grooves are mostly smooth and shining from long usage. Mr. 
Paul Schumacher found a number of these implements in southern Cali- 
fornia graves, and he describes 
their application.' The stones 
were heated and the crooked 
shafts rubbed back and forth in 
the grooves under pressure until 
they became straight. As the 
stones had to withstand a consid- 
erable degree of heat, serpen- 
tine, a material possessing tliat 
quality, was generally chosen. 
Straighten ers of the ruder kind 
were made in California of frag- 
ments of soapstone vessels. The Apaches and other western tribes used 
until lately very neat straighteners of serpentine, often iirovided with 
two grooves. The author, however, was informed that they did not heat 
the stone, but heated the shafts, and then i^ressed them back and forth 
in the grooves. Some of the California specimens have been cractkled by 
the heat to which they were exposed. From the uniform jxdish of the 
grooves, it maybe inferred that such stones were also used for smooth- 
ing the shafts. Similar utensils, apparently for the same use, are in the 
Museum collection, 
ranging in locality 
from Massachusetts 
to California. 

The Eskimos used 
a different tool for 
straightening their 
arrow shafts. It was 
a piece of 
bone, or ^ 
frequent- 
ly ivory, 
heavy 
and solid, 
wnth an 

enlargement at the upper end through which was a perforation usually 
of lozenge shai)e. The arrow shaft was put through this hole, and 
the instrument, used as a wrench, bent the shaft as was required to 
make it straight. Dr. Boas figures one of them '^ (fig. 79), and European 
prehistoric archa'ologists have frequently done the same. '

ARROWPOINTS, SPEARHEADS, AND KNIVES. 887 

Dr. HoU'mau, in his article entitled "The Graphic Art of the 
Eskimo,'" figures a half dozen of these similar in some regards to those 
already shown. They are from Cape Nome, Sledge Island, Diomede, 
and Cape Darby, all on the Alaskan coast. He introduces these in the 
attempt to correlate them and similar specimens of Eskimoan art with 
that of the Paleolithic period as manifested in the specimens from the 
caverns of Dordogne, France, a proposition to which the author does 
not agree. 

Fig. 80 is an arrow-shaft straighteiier used by the Hupa Indians of 
California. It is a piece of yew, 10 inches long, spindle-shaped, and 
having an oblong hole through the middle. The arrow shaft is drawn 
through the hole and straightened by pressure on the ends of the tool.^ 

VIII. CLASSIFICATION OF ARROWPOINTS AND SPEARHEADS. 

f, leaf -shaped ; IT, triangular ; III, stemmed; IV, peculiar forms. 

Dr. Ran had ]n'e])ared a paper entitled "The Typical Forms of North 
American Prehistoric Relics of Stone and Copper in the United States 
National Mnseum," but he died before it was completed. It has always 
been the author's intention to complete and publish this i^aper. That 
portion of the text relating to arrowpoints and spearheads is as follows: 

ARROW AND SPEARHEAD SHAPED OIUECTS. 

They coustitiite the most numerous class of chipped-stoue articles in the Uuited 
States. Collectors are very apt to desiguate iudiscriniiuately all objects of dart- 
head-like form, as arrow or spear points, without considering that many of these 
specimens may have been quite differently employed by the aborigines. Thus several 
Western tribes used, within recent times, chipped-dint blades identical in shape witb 
those that are usually called ai'row and spear heads, as knives, fastening them in 
short wooden handles by means of a black resinous substance or asphaltum. 

The stone-tipped arrows quite recently made by various Indian tribes are mostly 
provided with slender points, often less than an inch in length, and seldom exceed- 
ing an inch and three-(|uarter8, as exemplified by many specimens of modern arrows 
in the National Museum. If this fact be deemed conclusive, it would follow that 
the real Indian arrowhead was comparatively small, and that the larger specimens 
classed as arrowpoints, and not a few of the so-called spearheads, were originally 
set in handles and were used as knives and daggers. However, it is not improbable 
that in formcn- times larger arrowheads were in use among the natives. 

In many cases, further, it is impossible to determine the real character of leaf- 
shaped or triangular objects of chipped stone, as they may have served as arrow- 
heads, or either as scrapers or cutting tools in which the convex or straight Itase 
formed the working edge. Certain chipped spearhead shaped specimens with a 
sharp straight or convex base may have been cutting implements or chisels. Arrow- 
heads of a slender form pass over almost imperceptibly into perforators, insomuch 
that it is often impossible to make a distinction between them. 

In view of these uncertainties, the writer has brought the arrow and spear point 
shaped objects under one head, which is the more excusable as, generally speaking, 
size is the only distinguishing feature.

888 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

The attempt is here made to segregate and classify arrowpoints, 
spearheads, and knives. In Europe they have always been denomi- 
nated arrowpoints or spearheads, determinable only by their size; in the 
United States, by comparison with those of the Indian of historic time, 
we have been able to draw the line of demarcation possibly with greater 
accuracy. We have also discovered, through the prehistoric as well as 
the historic Indians, that these implements may have been used as 
knives; therefore, in the headings, they have been denominated by all 
three names — arrowpoints, spearheads, and knives. 

No racial or tribal classification is here attempted from these imple- 
ments. If classified according to material, and afterwards divided 
geographically, they ought to tell of the difference in the various 
peoples using them, if any such existed. This work the author has yet 
before him. 

We have already seen that the material employed would be that 
which would serve the purpose best and was nearest ami most easily 
obtained. The elements of commerce and ease of transportation must 
be regarded in ascertaining the locality of the material. To correctly 
determine this, we mnst consider the known facts as to distance, qual- 
ity, weight, and value of material transported. 

The present classification is based on the form and size of the imple- 
ment. In order that the series contemplated by the present classification 
shall be as complete as possible, those from Europe which belong to the 
earlier epochs are included. The weapons of the Paleolithic period — 
the Ohelleen im])lements, tlie Mousterien spear points, the Solutreen 
leaf-shaped and one-shouldered i^oints, and the Madelainien points and 
harpoons — have been already described, and we have concluded that they 
may have served as spears, lances, javelins, or harpoons, but not arrow- 
points or knives. The leaf shaped implements used as spear and har- 
poon heads in the Paleolithic i)eriod continued into the succeeding 
prehistoric periods, and were then used as arrowpoints as well as for 
spears or harpoons. This does not clash with the theory that arrows 
were not used during the Paleolithic period. 

A classification of arrowpoints and spearheads has been attempted 
by but few archiieologists. Sir John Evans,' General Pitt-Eivers,'' Sir 
W. R. Wilde,^ and Dr. Charles Ran are the principal ones who have 
essayed a classification, but in their descriptions they scarcely employed 
their own. The first two gentlemen made four classes. Some of the 
classifications were arranged according to probable successive develop- 
ment, thus: leaf-shaped, lozenge-shaped, tanged or steinined, and tri- 
angular. Sir W. R. Wilde (and Sir John Lubbock follows him) arranged 
them thus: triangular, indented base, stemmed, barbed, and leaf- 
shaped. Dr. Edwin A. Barber* as follows: leaf-shaped, triangular,

indented at the base, stemmed, barbed, beveled, diamond-shaped, awl- 
shaped, and those having the sha])e of a serpent's head. Dr. Abbott' 
does not make any formal classification, but uses as descriptive terms: 
barbed, triangular, ]eaf-shai)ed, l()zongeshai)ed, notched base, serrated, 
stemmed, barbed triangular, trii)le notched-based, unsymmetrical. Dr. 
Eau originally made a classification of 22 subdivisions, but in the paper 
prepared just before his death, he made another, as follows: 

Convex or straight-sided (r.irely concave-sided) with convex, straight, or concave 
base. 

Notched at tlie sides near the base, whicli is convex, straight, or concave, rarely 
pointed. 

Stennnod ; expanding stem with convex, straight, or concave base. 

Stemmed; parallel-sided stem with convex, straight, or concave base. 

Stemmed ; contracting straight-sided stem with convex, straight, or concave base. 

Stemmed; contracting bioad stem with rounded or pointed termination. 

Stemmed; tapering stem. 

Barbed and stemmed. 

Leaf-shaped implements; rounded at one end, pointed at the other; pointed at 
both ends; rounde<l at both ends. 

The making in my department during the year 1801-92, of the 100 
series of 100 casts each of typical implements of the United States, for 
educational purposes, afforded the opportunity, if it did not create the 
necessity, for a comi^rehensive classification. To send out a series of 
arrowpoints or spearheads without classification or name would be a 
waste of time and labor; while, if made of plaster, they would be so 
fragile as to be a waste of money as well. Therefore I prepared series 
of these implements, classified them by type, arranged them by size, 
and had them i^hotographed and engraved, each class by itself so they 
might be understood almost as well as from an inspection of the 
originals. It was found necessary to employ many specimens to make 
a proper display. Many of these objects in the same division are 
similar in form, appearance, and material, the main ditl'erence being in 
their size. But this ditference of size may change the character, use, 
and name of the weapon, and it may, according to size, become an 
agricultural implement used for digging in the earth . a spear, dagger, 
poniard, scalping or fish knife, or an arrowpoint or lancet. All these 
sizes of implements with uses and names are known to students 
of prehistoric archteology and collectors of anti(iuities. This differ- 
ence in size is a reason for giving many cuts of the same form of imple- 
ments but of different sizes. A large imj)lemeut, if reduced in size, 
represents to the eye of the beholder a small one. He has seen both 
the large and the small one, is acquainted with both, and when he sees 
a cut of given size which is a correct representation of a. small iniple 
ment, he will involuntarily associate it with the real imi)lement of small 
size. The author has seen an engraving of one of these large digging 
implements, the original of which was 16^ inches long and 5 inches

wide. The drawiiij>- was reduced to one-third, and the engraving one- 
half from tlie drawing. Thus this large and formidable implement was 
represented by a figure 2f inches by five sixths of an inch, which is but 
the size of a common arrow or spear head. No rule or scale can give 
it its true appearance in the eyes of the majority of readers. These 
engravings are intended to serve as a classification of these implements 
by which their names, and ])0ssibly their functions, may be known, and 
by which archu'ologists throughout the country, and i)erhaps tlie world, 
may be better enabled to understand and describe them. When we 
consider that it is beyond tlie power of mere words to describe a form, 
and that a figure, cut, or representation of it must be or must have been 
made at some time in order to comiiuiuicate knowledge of a form to any 
person who has not previously seen it, the author trusts he will be 
iustified in the classification and the engravings by which it is sought 
to be represented. 

The names of the different parts of stone arrowpoints and spear- 
heads or knives are: blade, point, stem, base, edge, shoulder, barb, 
notch. 

The failure of niany archaeologists (and it is not confined entirely to 
them) to make a distinction between the words "side" and "edge" has 
led to a confusion in description. " Border," " rim," " margin " are, or may 
be, synonymous with "edge," but "side," although much used in this 
sense, is almost always erroneously used. We say the " side" of a table 
when we mean the edge, the border, the margin, that part farthest from 
the center or middle. Applying it to a plank or sword or arrowpoint or 
si^earhead, we should say "edge." "Edge'' is particularly appropriate 
for swords and arrowpoints and spearheads, as it applies specially to 
the " sharp and thin cutting border or extremity of an instrument." 

The author has sought to make his classification as simple as possible. 
Minute or complex divisions will never be adopted in popular usage. 
They will be difficult to understand and are impracticable in that they 
can not be easily remembered or readily a]:)plied. 

In the author's classification the primary divisions of arrowpoints, 
spearheads, or knives are as follows : 

Division f, Icaf-sliaped. — In this clussificntioii the h^af-shaped is phiced at the, head 
as heiug the oldest implenieut of its kind. This division includes all kinds: ellipti- 
cal, oval, oblong, or lanceolate forms bearing any relation to the shape of a leaf, 
and without stem, shoulder, or barb. 

Class A is pointed at both ends, the widest place one-third or one-fourth from the 
base. 

Class His more oval, less pointed, with base concave, straight, or convex. 

Class C is long and narrow, sharp points, parallel edges, and bases concave, straight, 
or convex. These belong to the Pacilic coast, 

Division J I, triamjnlar. — This division includes all specimens which, according to 
geometrical nomenclature, are in the form of a triangle, whether the bases or edges 
be convex, straight, or concave. They are without stems and consequently with- 
out shoulders, though in soml^ specimens the extreme concavity of the base produces 
barbs when the arrow shaft is attached. 



ARR0WP0INT8, SPEARHEADS, AND KNIVES (SOI 

Diriaion III, stemmed. — This divisioTi includes all vjirieties of stems, -whether 
straijiht, pointed, or expanding, round or Hat, exccjit those with certain peculiari- 
ties and included in Division IV; and whether the bases or edges are convex, 
straight, or concave. 

Class A is lo/enge-shaped, not shouldered nor barbed. 

Class 15 is shouldered, but not barlted. 

Class C is shouldered and barbed. 

These cover the commoner forms of arrowpoints and si^earheads 
throughout the workl. But there aie certain otliei forms which may 
be few in number or restricted in locality and scarcely entitled to divi- 
sions by themselves, yet are found in sufficient numbers and have such 
definite characteristics that they cau not be ignored. These the author 
has assigned to a general class under the head of "peculiar forms/' 

Division IV, pccuVmr forms. — This division includes all forms not belonging to the 
other divisions, and provides for those having peculiarities, or the specimens of 
which are restricted in number and locality. 

Class A, beveled edges. 

Class r>, serrated edges. 

Class C, bifurcated stems. 

Class D, long barbs, sc^uare at ends. Peculiar to England, Ireland, and (reorgia. 
United States. 

Class E, triangular in section. Peculiar to the province of Chiriqui, Panama. 

Class F, broadest at cutting end, tranchant transversal. Peculiar to western 
Europe. 

Class G, polished slate. Peculiar in North .\nierica tu the Eskimo country and 
to New England and New York. 

Class H, asymmetric. 

Class I, curious forms. 

Class K, iierforators. 

DIVISK )N I— LEAF-SHAPED. 

The author essayed botanical and geometrical terms iu this descrip- 
tion, but found them unsatisfactory. The imidements have such vari- 
ety of form, each slightly different from the other, that specific terms 
were scarcely ever applicable. They are lanceolate, as already men- 
tioned ; leaf-shaped, but as leaves have many different forms, so have 
these implements, and "leaf-shaped'' is rather generic than specific. 
He essayed the geometrical terms of ovate, oblong, truncated, elliptical, 
lenticular, but found he could only use them in descrii)tions of indi- 
vidual specimens. 

Dr. Eau, in his unpublished paper, speaking of leaf-shaped imple- 
ments, said: 

These are numerous and of great variety in form and size, insomuch that a minute 
classilication would bo difficult. However, thej' can be divided in a general way 
into three classes, in accordance with their being rounded at one end and pointed at 
the other, or pointed at both ends, or rounded at both ends. They vary in length 
from less than an inch to more than 13 inches, and there is in the National Museum 
a cast of a sword-like flint blade measuring more than 21 inches iu length, which 
by its form pertains to the class here treated. The oiiginal, from a mound in Ten- 
nessee, is in the possession of Dr. Joseph Jones, of New Orleans.

Dr. Eau says of this class : 

Some are broad iu iiroportiou to tlitir length, others are very slender. The mode 

of appliration of these variously shaped iniplenieuts is doubtful in 

most cases, but some aid iu judging of the use of certain leaf-shaped 

blades is afibrded by the fact that similar ones have been seen shafted 

or handled in actual emphiyment among modern 

Indian tribes. It is difficult to draw a line ol 

drniarcation l;etween rude and leaf-shaped im- 

l)lenients, considering that the foruusr very often 

approach thclcaf form, not only in North America, 

but also in other quarters of the globe where 

man had to employ stone in I'ashiijuing his tools 

au<l weapons. 

This last remark of Dr. liaii is certainly "^^ 

true as regards the leaf-shaped implement 
of the Solutreen or Cavern jjeriod of the 
Paleolithic age, but lias slight application 
to those of the Chelh-en epoch or Allu- 
vial period. The ditierence is quite ap- 
parent to any person who has any ac- 
quaintance with the latter imi^lements. 
The confusion between the two kinds of 
implements arises, usually or frequently, 
among those who depend upon cuts and 
illustrations for theii- knowledge rather 
than on an acquaintance with the real 
objects. Their error is caused by the 
illustration usually being of only the flat 
side without any edge view. The two 
classes of implements may have a resem- 
blance of outline and of chipped work 
when looked at from the flat side, but an 
edge view would reveal the difference at 
once. The leaf-shaped implement is 
chipped down thin, frequently to one- 
fourth of an inch, while the Chelleen im- 
plement is more likely to be from 1 to If 
inches iu thickness. A glance at the folded 
plate at the end of Sir John Evans's An- 
cient Stone Implements will show this 
peculiarity. Reference is made to figs. 1,2. 
Fig. 84 presents the same appearance 
from a side view as the leaf-shaped. This 
impression is erroneous. The imi)lement is not one 
properly called leaf-shaped, and the dittereuce is re- 
cognizable by a glance at the specimen. The leaf-shaped implements 
proper are thin; their thickness is from one-fourth to one-fifth of their 
width; only one of these here shown is more than one-half inch in thick-

iiess. The thickness of the iini)lemeiit represented by this figure is froaft 
one-third to one-lialf of its width. Its thickness makes the difference. 
The iiuthor would not iiflirni tliat objects of this chiss belong to a diflereut 
epoch or Avere made by different prehistoric people, nor the difference 

in the use for which they were intended. 
The leaf-shaped implements are themselves 
quite too doubtful on these (juestions to 
justify dogmatism on the part of any per- 
son, and the latter implements with their 
differences serve to increase rather than 
diminish the difficulties of a satisfactory 
decision. The two figures (85 and 86) pre- 
sent the same idea. From the side view 
alone one would not know the difference

between these implements and those following. But with the thickness 
remarked one recognizes at a glance that these are not in any sense 
the leaf-shaped implements we have been considering. They are not 
made by the same lu'imitive man, nor do they belong to the same epoch

of the Paleolithic period, and the thiu one, pointed at both ends, to a 
much later epoch. The first belongs to the Chelh'cn, Mammoth, C)ave- 
bear, or Alluvium epoch; the second to 
the Solutreen, lieindeer, or Cavern epoch. 

The distinctions between these epochs 
have not been made in the United States, 
and possibly do not exist. But the author 
has ventured to investigate whether the 
Paleolithic period had not possibly an ex- 
istence in the United States, and to sug- 
gest that these rude and thick implements, 
acknowledged by all to be so characteristic 
of the Paleolithic i)eri()d in Europe, and 
so unknown to the Xeolithic period in both 
Europe and America, may not have been 
its representatives. 

Of the thiu, true leaf-shaped implements 
in some of their forms, the author has said 
they seem to have belonged to both periods, 
and so their discovery, unsupported by as- 
sociated objects, is not evidence as to either 
period. He trusts he has explained the dif- 
ferences between these implements, the 

thick and the thin — that though from the side view they have great 
resemblance, yet are really widely separated in culture, time, and 
art — and he hopes the reader will not confound them.

This class corresponds to the Solutreen type of the Paleolithic period 
in France. It is i)ointed at both ends; it approaches the elliptical 
and the oval, but is not regular in either form, for its greatest width 
is about one-fourth to one-third the distance from the base to the 
point. In France this is called " feuille de laurier" (laurel leaf). It 
is symmetrical, quite thin, the edges and sides having been chipped 
with great delicacy and fineness. According to botanical nomenclature 
it approaches the lanceolate. The appearan(;e of this imj^leuient in 
Europe during the Paleolithic period and its continuance into and 
through the Neolithic ])eriod have been described on p. 828, and need 
not be repeated. This implement and the convex scraper are common 
to both periods, and are the two implements which belong equallj^ to the 
Paleolithic and Neolithic periods.

The following illustrations give a fair idea of these implements in 
North America. They run the entire range of size, from the very large 

to the very small. Plate 25 has a fragment of 
a large one of obsidian from Cordova, Mexico. 
Fig. 87 is a leaf-shaped implement from Fol- 
som, California, of symmetrical form, though 
chipped in rough and rather large flakes. It 
bears the evidence of use. It may have 
been handled and used as a spear, or it may 
have had a skin or other wrapping and been 
used as a knife 
or dagger. 
Fig. 88 is from

of flinty chert, 
and is a won- 
derful piece of

chipping. The 
flakes run to 
the center, and 
so have r e -

which is one- 
eighth of an

pieces, one of 
which is lost. 
Fig. 89 is a very thin specimen of fine-

prevalent along the Atlantic seaboard 
from the Potomac to the James rivers. It 
is found in abundance in the neighbor- 
hood of Washington City (Plate 28, fig. 3). 
Fig. 91 is of chalcedony, delicately 
chipped, pointed at both ends, and is symmetrically lenticular (Plate

A cbaracteristic of the Mousterien (Paleolithic) point is that it 
was made from a Hake struck from the nucleus with a single blow, and 
the under or tlat side was left unobipped and untouched, 
while the top or outside was wrought by chipping to a 
fine edge and i)oint. Fig. 93 is almost uni(jue among 
American specimens in the U. S. National Museum 
in the possession of this characteristic. The illustra- 
tion is of the top side, and it shows the chipping; 
the other side is a clean fracture with no chipping. 
The specimen is pale-bluish chalcedony, translucent, 
and comes from Mexico. It is pointed at both ends and 
belongs to Class A, leaf-shaped. Fig. 94 is leaf-shaped, 
elliptical, pointed at both ends, and belongs to Class A. 
It comes from Georgia. The material is the gray pyro- 
machic chert similar to the large disks (Plates 62-03) 
found in caches in Ohio and Illinois. The tipend of the 
base shows the crust of the pebble from which the im- 
plement was made. In general appearance it resembles 
the others of Class A, but has a distinguishing differ- 
ence which may assist in determining the method of use of this style 
of implement. It has two notches opposite each 
other in the edges near the base, evidently inten- 
tional, and which we may assume were for attach- 
ment of a handle by ligature. The implement is

It may be useless to speculate on these different uses, but tbe circum- 
stances seem to point toward its use as a knife or dagger. 
Tbe danger of fracture of sucb long, thin flint implements, so easily 
broken by tbe shock which would be inevitable in 
their employment as spears, appears so much against 
that employment that the author prefers to believe 
them to have been knives or daggers. Held in the 
hand, they would give the maximum of service with 
the minimum of danger from breakage. 

Fig. 95 is another of the same type as fig. 04, in that 
it is a leaf-shaped, Class A, spear point and has the 
two notches near the base as if for ligatures, which is 
equally pronounced evidence of it having been in- 
tended for a knife or dagger. It is 2 inches wide 
and but five- sixteenths of an inch thick, so that it 
would be too fragile for a spearhead. Its edges are 
convex for the principal portion of the blade, but 
near the point they become concave, making the edge 
for the entire length a combination of concave and 
convex — an ogee. This has the effect of sharpening 
the point and giving it a needle form. This needle 
form is extremely rare, this being tlie only specimen 
remarked in the U. S. National Museum. The notch 
ill the edges of a leaf-shaped implement pointed at 
both ends (Glass A) is almost equally rare, as the 
two specimens here shown are the only ones we 
have. They are introduced not so much because 
of the rarity of their form as that it may assist in 
deciding the ultimate destination of the class of leaf-shaped imple- 
ments to which they belong and which has never been satisfiictorily 
determined. These specimens are from the eastern or middle United 
States and so have no relation with the long, thin blades from the 
Pacific coast.

in the Uuited States. The large aigillite specimens from Trenton, 

New Jersey, fomul by Dr. C. C. Abbott, belong to this class. These 

are exceedingly interesting and deserve profound study, as they may 

prove the connecting link between the Paleo- 
lithic and Neolithic periods in the United 
States. It will be remembered how the leaf- 
shaped implements were common to both 
periods. These are of argillite, tlie material 
used exclusively for the Trenton implements 
in the glacial gravels of 1he Delaware. 

Fig, 102 is one of these argillite leaf-shaped 
implements found by Dr. Abbott at Trenton. 
Its shape is shown in the illustration. One 
of these specimens is photographed in the 
classification, leaf-shaped, Class B (Plate 29, 
fig. 3). The material seems to have been 
easily chipped; it could be struck off in 
broad, thin Hakes, shell-shaped, and not long, 
straight, and narrow as with flint, obsidian, 
and other chippable materials. Therefore, 
the chipping appears 
gross, yet the desid- 
eratum of a thin, sharp 
Fig. 102. implement is obtained. 

Fig. 103 is another of 
the same material and 
from the same locality. 
The same remark is to 
be made as to its flakes. 

Fig. 104 is from Paxton, Sullivan County, Indi- 
ana. Comparison of these three objects will 

manifest the difference in the chipping of the 

material. Although the surface of the latter 

(fig. 101) is much smaller than that of the former, 

yet the number of flakes struck from it is three 

times greater. The argillite specimens (figs. 102, 

103) have, resi)ectively, but 12 and 13 flakes 

struck from the broad side; the jaspery flint (fig. 

101) has no less than 40. Tlie argillite, contrary 

to its appearance, is quite hard, and takes and 

holds a fairly sharp edge; altogetlier, it was a 

good material and recommended itself for stone 

implements. 

Figs. 105 and 106 represent specimens of leaf-shaped implements 

from Ohio. They are of flint, and, while sharp at the point, are so 

convex at the base as to pass gradually into the disk form so plentiful

ill their locality. These formed part of a cache of 201 specimens found 
in 1872 by S. W. IJriggs in Sullivan Township, Ashland County, about 
18 inches beneath the surface, deposited in a kej?-like vessel of the 
bark of the red elm, 10 or 12 inches in diameter and 13 inches in lieio-ht. 
The speciaiens average in size from 4 inches long, 2 to 2f inches Mude, 
and three-eighths of an inch thick. 

Fig-. 107 is a beautiful specimen, as delicate as though it had been 
intended for use in a lady's dressing case. It is but one-eighth of an 
inch thick. It is of dark-gray lustrous flint, with a patina similar to 

that on the Ohelh-en implements from the gravels of the 

rivers Somme and Onse in Europe.

armatures of arrows. He saw, moreover, among the Indians of Oregon, arrows 
tipped with leaf-shaped flint points. (Ran.) 

Fig. 108, from Santa Barbara County, California, is a peculiar, 
long, thin, narrow blade, with a sharp point, and, interesting to 
remark, its base shows traces of asphaltum or bitumen, by which 
its shaft or handle was attached. This demonstrates the mode of 
attachment, bnt does not aid in the solution whether it was intended 
for use as a knife or an arrow ; that, the shaft or handle alone could 
determine. 

Fig. 100, knife or arrowpoint, is even longer and thinner than the 
former (fig. 108).

Fig'. 112 is a be:mtiftil specimen of trauslucoiit chalcedony, and is 
wrought to a true and even edge by almost iutiiiitesimal tiakiug. The 
point and edges one-third way up are smoothed as if 
by use, not polished, but as though the sharpness of 
the edge had been worn off. It is a 
fine specimen. 

Fig. 113 is of pori)hyritic felsite, 
which forms so large a portion of the 
material for i)rehistoric implements 
from eastern Massachusetts. Fig. 
114 is of reddish quartzite, fine- 
grained and hard. It is from Kliode 
Island, and has convex edges and a 
straight base. Fig. 115 was found at 
Chattanooga in Tennessee by Messrs. 
Eead and Dayton, but is of the white 
flint which belongs to Illinois and 
Missouri, and is a form common to 
those Western States. It is widest near the base, 
and from the jilace of its greatest expansion to the 
point the edges are straight, and 
not convex as usual. Fig. 110, from 
Knox County, Illinois, is of the pale-gray flint with 
the lustrous chalcedonic appearance common to that 
State. It is deeply weathered, espe- 
cially at the two ends, where it is 
thin. Fig. 117 is elliptical and sym- 
metrical. The edges are smooth and 
sharp, with fine chipping of long and 
regular shell-like flakes reaching 
from the edge to the center ridge. 
It is a specimen of the most dif- 
ficult flint chipping in the Museum. 
There are 48 flakes shown on the 
two sides. Tliey are one-half to live-

one-half an inch. There is no evidence of use. Fig. 

119 is leaf-shaped, convex 
but not rounded base, broad 
in i)roportion, with convex

Fig. 120 is pale blue, 
almost white, chalcedonic 
flint, from Flint Kidge, 
Licking County, Ohio. The 
characteristic small (juartz 
crystals are to be seen on 
its surface. Its base and 
edges are both convex, as 
shown in the illustration. 
The edges all around have been chipped so 
thin that the light will show through. Dr. 
Eau has said this was 
probably a knife, and it 
may have been, but there 
is nothing except its com- 
parative width to indicate 
anything different from 
any other implement of 
the same class, and what 
it might have been is de- 
terminable only by the 
shaft or handle. If it had 
a long shaft, then this was 
an arrow or spear; if a 
short handle, then it was 
a knife; and as to which 
it had we know nothing, 
either by direct or cir- 
cumstantial evidence.

This class accommodates the long, narrow blades 
from the Pacific coast. This va- 
riety can be studied in Plate 31, 
leaf-shaped, Class C. Their sides 
and edges are straight, and par- 
allel with each other, or nearly 
so. The convex deflection from a 
straight line by which the j)oiut 
is formed, may be abrupt or gen- 
tle according as the point is 
madebluntor tapering. The base 
may be either concave, straight, 
or convex; there seems to have 
been no regularity concerning it. 
In every case it is made by the 
regular chipping. The speci- 
mens vary greatly in length and 
width, but all are extremely 
thin, being from one-eighth to 
three- eighths, never more than 
one-half inch. The difference 
between width and length is 
greater than in any other class. 
The specimens on the plate show 
the following extremes: No. 1,8^ 
by l|byi\ inches; No. 7,3by§by

inches ; No. 13, 1 J by ^ by ^ inches. 
The materials of the imple- 
ments of this class are agate, 
chalcedony, iiint in its purer 
condition, obsidian, and similar 
fine material. These materials 
are susceptible of delicate chip- 
ping, and the prehistoric work- 
men have emiiloyed their oppor- 
tunity with the result of elegant 
and beautiful specimens. The usual remark is to be made as to their

Fig-. 124. a specimen of modern spear of obsidian flakes from New 
Caledonia, attached to a tliin handle or shaft by means of gum, bitumen, 
or asphalt, and, taken from Sir John Lubbock's 
Prehistoric Times, is inserted for comparison. 

Fig. 125 is an extremely thin, 
lincly chipped object, from Santa .m. 

liarbara County, California, and /^^ 

is a sample of those from the 
Pacific coast. We are to remark 
the long, narrow blade, the ])ar- 
allel edges, the fine material, the 
delicate chipping, and the ex- 
treme thinness as peculiarities of 
these implements from this lo- 
cality. The specimens on Plate 
31 will serve as further illustra- 
tions. 

Fig. 120 is another of the 
long, narrow, and thin flint or 
jasper implements from the Pa- 
cific coast. Although it is 7f 
inches long and 2 inches wide, 
it is but one-eighth of an inch 
thick. It, with two or three 
other specimens, is peculiar in 
that, though thin, they have 
not been reduced by chipping. 
They are quite flat in section, 
reduced in thickness only to form the edge. This i)ecu- 
liarity is caused by the layer of flint being of natural 
formation in its j) resent thickness. The deposit of flint, 
however made, has been intercalated witli a layer on 
each side of what has the appearance of lime or chalk, 
the surface being broken by right lines into parallelo- 
gramic figures, as shown in the illustration. Only 
slight chipping was necessary to reduce the imple- 
ment to a sharp edge. For the better understanding 
of this, reference is made to Plate 31, fig. 2. 

Fig. 127 is the longest, thinnest, and narrowest of 
these leaf-shai^ed objects from the Pacific coast. Its 
edges are parallel for nearly the entire length. It is 
slightly thicker nearer the base, which is strongly con- 
cave. It is of gray flint or jasi)er, and has been de- 
posited in the strata mentioned in the description of 
fig. 12G, of which traces are shown in the illustration, 
been wrought by chipping, and they, with the point and barbs, are fine 
and sharp.

Figs. 128 and 129 (see Plate 31, fig. 2) belong to tlie same class. They 
are from the same locality, Santa Barbara County, California, and 
evidently the same material, which is stratified Hint 
or chalcedony, lustrous, having the appearance of a 
brilliant patina. The edges are parallel and the bases 
slightly concave. 

VVe now pass to an implement having sutlicient re- 
semblance to re(]uire its placement in Class C, and 
although from the same locality as the foregoing im- 
plement, it has such a difference of material, work- 
manship, and apparently of service, tbat its manufac- 
ture and use may have been separated from them by 
long time or distance or perhaps both. Two speci- 
mens of this kind are here shown (tigs. 130, 131). They 
are from Dos Pueblos, Santa Barbara Countj' , Califor- 
nia, are of black flint, and bear traces (especially the 
larger, fig. 130) of bitumen having served as an attach- 
ment for a handle. (See p. 900 and fig. 124.) 

Fig. 130 represents an implement, 10 inches long 
and 1^ inches wide, its edges being perfectly straight 
and parallel for 7i inches of the length, and of ex- 
quisite workmanship. Fig. 131, though not so large 
is equally as fine (Plate 31, fig. 4). The edges and 
points are smooth and sharp. The chipping by which 
they have been reduced has been fine, with small and 
delicate flakes running from the edge to the center 
ridge. An inspection of the illustrations will show 
the beauty of the work. Both specimens bear traces 
of the bitumen by which the shalt or handle was 
fastened.

DIVISION II— TRIANGULAR. (Plate 32.) 




This division includes all arrowpoints or spearheads in the form of a 
triangle, whether the bases or edges be straight, convex, or concave. 
It might be that the concavity or convexity of the lines of the edges 
would, in strict geometrical nomenclature, exclude this from being 
called a triangle, but the author ignores this criticism and has kept 
the name given by many others and understood by all. 

This class includes all kinds of triangles, whether equilateral or 
isosceles, and whatever may be the relation of length between the 



910 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

Hues of base and edjie. The etlj^es may be convex or concave and 
the base with an exaggerated concavity, the two corners forming barbs, 
the arrow shaft the stem (Plate 32, figs. 3, 8, 20, 23, 2G). Some of these 
ini[)lenients are extremely rude, especially those of quartz and of jas- 
per, which are refractory material, but many of these have been deli 
cately and finely chipped. 

Triangular arrowpoints, while found in great profusion in some local- 
ities, are not nearly so numerous throughout the country as other divi- 
sions. They ai^pear in greater numbers on the Atlantic coast than in 
the interior. Dr. Abbott says that in a series of 3,300 arrowpoints from 
Mercer County, New Jersey, 1,428 were triangular. Although this 
may be the simplest form of arrowpoint, yet the author doubts if that 
be evidence of its having had any precedence in manufacture, or that 
there was any evolution from it to other forms. That there may 
have been relationship is granted. The arrow maker may have made 
indifferently the triangular and leaf-shaped, and he may have changed 
from one to the other, dependent upon the peculiarities of the material 
and the success with which he was able to work it, and the question of 
fashion and custom can not be ignored. It is thought these reasons 
are sufficient to account for the infinite variety of shape in arrowpoints. 

The author has laid down no hard and fast lines of division in this 
classification. Some of the leaf-shaped may have had their bases and 
edges straightened (Plate 30, fig. 8), and the triangular had their 
corners rounded until the two divisions came together (Plate 32, figs. 1, 
6); so also with the leaf-shaped and the stemmed. Some of the former 
have been notched near the base and thus been changed to stemmed, 
and so on through the entire system. This classification is made for 
the student and for convenience of description; therefore there will be 
overlapping of the dividing lines between the classes, as will be read- 
ily seen by referring to Plate 32. This must be accepted unless we 
would make infinitesimal divisions and every slight difference in form 
make a separate class. So each division includes all forms wliich 
approach nearest to it, even if they have peculiarities which make it 
difficult to harmonize. Some of the peculiarities in the triangular 
division are to be noted. One is where the convexity of the edges 
continued to the base brings a close resemblance to Division I, leaf- 
shaped. Class B, (Plate 30, figs. 1, 6). Another is the widening just at 
the base, by which the implement takes on a slight bell shape (Plate 
31, fig. 10) ; another is where the edges of the triangle do not come in a 
straight line nor yet in a curved line from the point to the base, but 
make an angle midway between the two and give the imj^lement a pen 
tagonal form rather than strictly triangular (fig. 178). A few of the 
triangular forms have serrated or beveled edges, though this is rare. 
Occasionally the barbs on one side are longer than the other. There is 
no rule for the concavity of the l)ase: it varies from almost a straight 
line to a depth equal to one-third of the length of the implement.

Dr. Rail, iu tlie paper already mentioned, gave expression to the pos- 
sibility of the trianguhir implement not having been an arrowpoint, 
but that the point may have been intended for insei- 
tion in a handle, and the base, being sharp, intended 
for a cutting implement and to be used for a chisel. 
(See p. 887.) 

However, the author does not 
subscribe to this opinion nor 
adopt the theory. He believes 
these were, of all others, plain," 
simple arrowpoints and never 
intended for anything else, ex- 
cept, possibly, that the heavier 
ones might have been attached 
to longer shafts and used as 
javelins. This would be practi- 
cally the same use as an arrowpoint, and no one, 
not linding the shaft or knowing its size or length, 
could know from any inspection of the implement 
this difference in its use. He does not think it 
could have been used as a 
chisel, for none of them that 
he has ever seen show any marks of use at the 
base. The greater pioportion of them, as has 
been said, have concave bases, and especially is 
this true of those with sharp edges. A chisel 
with a concave base is unknown iu our study 
of prehistoric man, and one can scarcely sug- 
gest the necessity for an implement i)ossessing 
this peculiarity, whether its use be by the Indian 
or the white man, historic or pre- 
historic. If thus used as a chisel, 
that which is now regarded as 
the point becomes the stem and 
is to be inserted into its handle; 
this would make a broad-ended 
chisel with a concave edge. A 
cutting edge of such width would 

give great purchase as against the handle, and if one 
should attempt to use these outside edges or corners 
after the manner of a chisel, the implement would be 
in danger of breaking out of its handle, or, if this was 
avoided, would require a stronger fastening than we 
could imagine that it ever received at the hands of the 
Indian. No handle fastened with a thong, sinew, cord, or even bitumen 
would ever be able to hold this implement handled in this way when used

as a chisel. One lias but to look at the modern chisel with its long 
steel tang well fitted and driven hard into a solid oak handle with a 
collar to receive the bottom of tbe handle, making the entire implement 
as firm in its handle as though it was all one piece. Watch the 
mechanic as he uses his chisel, strong and well-handled 
as it is, and see the purchase it has when used on the 
corners, and anyone will shortly understand the impos- 
sibility of the ancient handling being strong enough 
to stand this use. The same objection applies with 
equal force against the use of the implement as a knife, 
even when handled at the base as is the arrow. It 
would inevitably twist and slip and become loose in 
its handle, and so worthless. The author has, through- 
out this paper, contented himself with stating facts 
and has not advanced theories of his own nor argued 
those of others ; but in the pres- 
ent case he thinks a considera- 
tion of the situation and an in- 
vestigation of the surroundings will show that 
these implements were not used on their edges as 
cutting or sawing implements, 
either as chisels or knives, but 
solely for thrusting or striking 
with the point as arrows; but 
whether as arrows they were 
weapons of war or javelins for 
game he has no opinion, and 
no amount of examination of 
the object itself serves to eluci- 
date the theory. 

Fig. 132 is almost an ecpii- 
lateral triangle. It is of the porphyritic felsite 
common to eastern Massachusetts, and is thick, 
heavy, and rudely made. Its point is sharp, but not 
the barbs. It is a good representation of the aver- 
age and usual size and appearance of the triangular 
arrowpoint. 

Fig. 133 is one of the larger triangular arrowpoints 
or spearheads. It is of dark-gray Hint, almost black. 
Its edges are straight and its base concave, symmet- 
rical from every view, delicately chipped to regular 
and smooth point, edges, barbs, and base. 
Fig. 134 is quite thin, delicately chipped, showing 
very small serrations. The edges and base are concave. The points 
and barbs are fine and sharp. Fig. 135 is of white quartz, and for 
this material well and regularly chipped. It is (juite symmetrical,

with sliarp, isniooth point and edges. These appear mostly on the 
Athmtic coast. 

Fig-. 130 is one of those elegant and niinnte arrowpoints which have 
made Oregon renowned in the world of archa-ology. It is dark-brown 
jasper, is triangnlar in form, with long, tapering point. Its edges are 
very slightly concave, but the base is so deeply concave that the 
corners form long, slender barbs. Other specimens from the same 
locality have notches on the edges near the base, by meansof wdiicli the 
sinew or cord fastens the head to its shaft, but this, and indeed none of 
the triaugulars, have any such contrivance. 

Fig. 137 is one of the triangular forms from Massachusetts. It is 
rude and irregular on edges and base. 

Fig. 138, although with an elongated point, yet is to be classed as tri- 
angular. It is a marvel of tiint chipping. Four and a quarter inches 
long and 1^ inches wide, it is nowhere more than one-eighth of an inch 
in thickness. This is as thin as any si)ecimen can be expected. The 
base of this si)ecimen is slightly convex; the edges are nearly straight. 
They and the point are fine and sharp. 

Some of the specimens from the Pacific coast, tigured in leaf-shaped. 
Class C, are as thin as this, but, as described, this was their natural 
thickness. They were separated from each other by a deposit of extra- 
neous matter. This specimen is not of such formation. It has been 
wrought out of a solid block of flint, and was effected by those broad 
and thin flakes so often found, running from the edge, the point of pres- 
sure, to the center, widening into the form of a shell, and reducing the 
thickness of the imidement almost as much at the center as at the edge. 
This system is the perfection of flint chipping. It shows a high degree 
of manual dexterity, and is one of the lost arts, for no workman 
known in historic times has been able to reproduce it. 

DIVISION III— STEMMED. 

The author has not made this class dependent upon the lines of 
the edges or bases of these implements; thoy may be either convex, 
straight, or concave, and neither of these will have any eflect as to 
which class the implement is to be assigned. He has considered that 
it made but slight difference to the prinutive hunter or w^arrior when 
about to use one of these implements, either as an arrowi)oint, spear- 
head, or as a knife, whether it should be convex, straight, or con- 
cave, provided the point was sharp and the cutting edge keen and 
smooth. If to be used for piercing, the desideratum was a sharp point, 
the shape of the edge had no effect and was of no interest, and if 
as a knife and the edges to be used saw fashion, back and forth, it 
made little difference whether that edge should be concave, straight, 
or convex. xVs all stemmed implements presuppose a handle or shaft 
which incloses the stem, it makes e([ually slight difference whetiier 
the base of that stem should be concave, straight, or convex; there-

fore the author has uot allowed any of these distinctious to iufluence 
his classification. 

That these diflerent classes and the forms on which they depend 
should overlap and run into one another would seem inevitable, thus 
makiuji;- it sometimes doubtful to which class the implement should 
belong, and even difficult to decide correctly. The classification which 
is proposed, and indeed any classification which can be made is, as 
before stated, rather for the convenience of the modern student than 
from any intention of the primitive maker or user of these implements. 
While there may have been workshops which turned out certain forms of 
implements more than others, and while certain forms are found in 
given localities in greater numbers than in others, yet does not think 
that this was always the result of a well-defined intention on the part 
of the maker. If an arrowpoint, intended to have a convex edge, should 
by an unlucky stroke or an unintentional break be spoilt for that shape, 
it could still be remodeled and the edge made straight instead of con- 
vex, or concave instead of straight. So, also, that which was intended 
as a barbed arrowpoint, if one of the barbs should be broken, the barb 
on the other side could also be chipped off and the implement be made 
shouldered, but not barbed; and so on in other instances. 

The author has bethought of what he considers a good illustration of 
the differences in these implements. In the show window of a modern 
shoe store will be seen shoes of every imaginable shape, size, kind, and 
variety; no two pairs of them are alike, running the entire range from 
large to small, from coarse to fine, from high to low, from thick to thin, 
from costly to cheap; yet they are all shoes, and all intended for the 
same object of foot wear. The workmen may all make the same kind 
of shoes or make different kinds at different times, yet they surely 
are all shoemakers. So it was with the arrow makers and the arrow- 
points which they made; the difference in the arrowpoints may have 
been produced partly by the fashion of the locality, by the taste and 
ability of the workmen, or by the possibilities of the material; what 
may have been intended for one kind of arrowpoint may, by reason of 
the refractory material, have been changed to another, and the same 
workmen in the same workshop may, without having seriously intended, 
and perhaps without giving a good reason in every case, have produced 
nearly every kind of arrowpoint. 

If the author made a separate class for every change in detail, he 
would have an infinite number of classes with infinitesimal differences. 
He has preferred to ignore these, make his divisions broad and plain, 
and temporize with the overlapping forms.

These iuipleineuts are n.siially siiuill. I'liey are the simplest in form 
and, for tlie most part, rudest in exeeiitioii; yet this is no signification 
that they were the begiiiuin<;s or that there was an evolution from tliis 
to the more ehiborate forms. This simplicity and rude- 
ness may be accounted for in divers ways. The re- 
fiactory material may have had something to do with 
it, also the rapidity with which they were reiiuired to 
be made and the unskillfnlness of the airow maker. 
They may have been made during his apprenticeship; 
he, who in his beginning made these sitni)lest and 
rudest implements may have so acquired the ait as 
afterwards to make the finest and most delicate. 

These form Class A, the first of the 
division of stemmed arrowpoints. 
The existence of a stem implies its 
insertion in a shaft or handle; there 
fore there can be little or no doubt 
that these were intended to be thus 
used. 

Fig. 130 is one of the largest, as it 
is one of the best in workmanship, of its class in the 
U. S. National Museum. It is of porphyritic material, 
and comes from Lower California, therefore it aUbrds 
no standard of comparison; for the 
types of im])!ements in that country 
ii re different from those in other parts 
of the United States. It is lozenge- 
shaped, is so regularly pointed at both 
ends that it is uncertain which end 
was point and which was base. 

Fig. 140 comes from Massachusetts, 
is similar in form, with its sharp point 
and base, and, curiously enougli, is also of porphyritic 
material. These shari)-pointed bases of the class are 
unusual, if not rare, in any part of the United States. 
The more usual form of lozenge shape is shown in fig. 
141, which is of quartz, and comes from Charles County, Maryland. 
The refractory character of this nuitcrial may account largely for the 
predominance of this simple form and rndo style of arrowpoint. It is

inordinately thick coin])ared witli its width. It is three-fourths of an 
inch wide and five-sixteenths thick, nearly one-half. The leaf-shaped 
inii)lenients which have been described were five or six times greater 
in width than tliickness. 

The lozenge -shaped arrowhead with a rude but 
pointed stem without shoulders would appear impossi- 
ble to fasten firmly in an arrow shaft by means of 
ligatures, which suggests that some kind of gum or 
adhesive substance was used to make it fast, though 
the author does not know that any such specimen has 
been found showing traces of gum. Because of the 
great size and rudeness of the base 
of some of these implements, they 
may have been too large to receive 
the small arrow shaft and so may 
have required comparatively large 
and heavy handles. Thus, despite 
their small size as a class, they may 
have served as spears or possibly 
knives — who knows ? This is purely conjecture, based 
upon the appearance of the implement itself, and is 
liable to be overturned by the discovery of any new 
fact concerning it. 

Fig. 142, still lozenge-shaped, has 
no shoulder, but has a rudimentary 
base. The arrow maker has not, as 
in the former instance, worked the 
base to a point, but has left it one- 
fourth of an inch in width. This speci- 
men is from Connecticut, is of the 
dark-gray flint common to that State, 
and is a fair sample of the average size of this class 
of arrowpoint. 

Fig. 143 is of black flint from New York, of larger 
size than usual, but carries with it the simplicity of 
form and rudeness of manufacture mentioned of the 
others. The stem is still lozenge-shaped, no shoulder, 
and again the rudimentary base which here is about 
one half an inch thick. 

Fig. 144 is a specimen from Tennessee which merely repeats the 
peculiarities of the former si^ecimens.

Implements of this class are more numerous tliun tliose of any 
other division. There is this pronounced diflereiu e between them and 
iuiy others we have described. The implements have two parts with 
ditierent functions: (1) the blade which com- 
l)rises the point and edges, and is for piercing or 
cutting, and (2) the stem, for insertion in a 
shaft or handle. 
% We can not imagine the 

*^^ use of the stem to an ar- 

rowpoint or spearhead 
which would not be in- 
tended for insertion in a 
shaft or handle. The leaf- 
shaped ni;iy or may not 
have been inserted in a 
handle; many of them we 
know were not. It was the 
opinion of Dr. Rau that in 
certain specimens the base 
had served as a chisel or 

scrai)er. But the stem had no other function 
than for insertion in a shaft or handle. This 
iunctiou was subject to great variations, and, as 
we shall see, there were many kinds of stems 
and great variability in the mode of attachment. 
Fig. 145 is one of the few specimens of ancient 
arrowheads found attached to its shaft or handle. 
It comes fioni the j)eat moss of Giessboden, Switz- 
erland, and isligured in Keller's Lake Dwellings.' 
The handle is broken so that it is uncertain 
whether the implement was arrow or knife, but 
the bast (tr hber with which it was lashed is still 
discernible. Similar specimens have been found 
occasionally in Ireland and in Germany. 

Figs. 146 and 147 are the simi)lest and most pronounced of Class 
B, stemmed and shouldered, but not barbed. The stem is straight, 
with parallel edges and straight base; the shoulders are square and at

ance. The edges are convex and symmetrical, and the i)oint on the 

median line. They are from 3 to 
5 inches long, and inserted in 
a propel- si i aft would make a good

of the implements, all tliose of 
Class 0, seem to have been shoul- 
dered with the idea of making a 
barbed Aveapon, but the first in- 
tention was to make a stemmed 
weapon.

straight, the shoulders are slight niid unsymnietrical, while the edges 
are straight and come to a point. The implement is exceedingly thick, 
the base being more than luilf as thick as it is wide. 
The workmanshi]> is rude; one can scarcely see where 
any tlakes have been strnck ott", and it would seem to 
have been broken to its present shape by blows given 
at random. We must remodel our 
ideas in regard to arrow shafts if we 
would have this implement inserted 
therein, whether to be fastened by 
ligatures or gum. It is probably 
unfinished. 

Fig. ir>l is somewhat the same form 
as those just described, but its work- 
manshi}) is better. It has been fairly 
well chipped, the tlakes taken off are 
easily recognizable, and the edges all 
around are fairly smooth and sharp. 
It is of reddish jasper. The stem is straight and paral- 
lel, the base is straight, the edges from the base to the 
blade are slightly concave, forming the shoulders; 
while those from the shoulder to the point are convex. 
Fig. 152 is of whitish flint from Texas. It is rude in 
its manufacture, quite thick com- 
pared with the width, the stem is 
straight, the base slightly con- 
cave, the shoulders but little more 
than rudimentary, and altogether 
it serves to emphasize the difti- 
culty of inserting these imple- 
ments in a shaft in such manner 
as to serve as arrows. 

Fig. 153 is of bluish chalcedony 
from Louisiana. It is much finer 
and better made, thinner compared 
with the width, and would bc^ 
much easier inserted in an arrow 
shaft or handle. Its stem is taper- 
ing, the base straight, the shoulders indefinite, the 
edges convex and coming together form a point. 

Fig. 154 has the edges of its blade straight and 
not convex. The point and corners are somewhat 
rounded ; it is shouldered but not barbed, the stem 
is expanding, and the base is slightly (loncave. 
Its size, length, and width, compared with thickness, place it on the 
border between an arrowpoint and a spearhead.

Fig. IT),") is similar to fig. 151, Just described. Tliongli widely sep 
arated by distance, the former coming from Tennessee, the latter from 
Pennsy]vania,tlieyliave great resemblance. Both are 
of jasi)er, with api)arently the same style of workmau- 
sbip. The base, stem, and shoulders 
of the latter are iiiiich the same as 
the former, excei)t that they are ac- 
centuated. The stem is narrower, 
its lines more concave or slightly 
more expanding toward the base, 
where they form corners of an acule 
angle. The base is slightly concave 
where the other is straigjit. The 
implement is the same length as fig. 
lal, though narrower ami thinner. 
Fig. 3 50 is from Ohio. It, like 
the former specimen, is fairly well 
chi])ped, flakes i>lainly to be seen, 
and the edges and i)oint compara- 
tively smooth and sharp. The stem 
is straight, its edges parallel, and the 
base straight and square. The shoulders are formed 
after the same manner as fig. 151, preceding, and simply swell out so as 
to make a more pronounced shoulder than in that specimen. The edges 
are convex and coming together form the i)oint. 

Figs. 157 and 158, the former from Tennessee, the 
latter from Massachusetts, are almost identical in form. 
The former is of gray, the latter of black flint. With 
exceptions of material, color, and size, they are the 
same. If they were to be compared 
by form only, scarcely anyone would 
be able to detect a difference between 
them. Their edges are straight and 
come directly to a point. Their shoul- 
ders are horizoiial, not barbed; the 
notch Avhich forms the stem is con- 
cave and carried to the base of the 
stem; the base is square and dressed 
to a smooth edge so that it can be 
inserted in a si)lit arrow shaft, while 
the notches on either side aflord excellent supports 
for attachment by ligatures. 

Fig. 159 has a stem similar to figs. 157 and 158. The 
notch which forms it is concave, extending from shoul- 
der to base and making an expanding stem with convex base. The edges 
are convex and, converging symmetrically, ibrm a medium sharp point.

The next two specimens (figs. KJO, 101), wliile liaving stems sluuil- 
deied and not barbed, belong to ( 'lass I>, but represent a marked ditler- 
ence froai the former specimens. Wiiile the edges of 
the stem are straight and i»arallel. the base is convex. 
No reason has ever been given for this peculiarity, but 
it is a noticeable one and involves 
another even less explainable. Why 
the stem of an arr<)wi)oint intemled 
Ibr insertion in a shaft should be 
made convex instea<l of straight or 
concave, is a matter ofbut slight im 
])ortan<'e and need in itself excite no 
cnriosity; bnt all bases of stems 
which are convex have been worn or 
rubbed, or in some way made smooth. 
They have not been polished or ground 
upon the sides, but liave been o[)er 
aled in a reverse manner against the 
edge of the base, and have made it 
blunt and smooth and not sharp. It would be beyond 
the author's ])rovince to say that this is universal, for 
no man could have had suth(ientexi)eiience to justify such astatement, 
but in the l'. S. National JMuseum thousands of such arrowpoinls have 
been tested and 90 per cent or more of them have been 
found to be in this condition. IS"© 
explanation has ever been given, nor 
has any been suggested. It is more 
marked in the cases of leaf-shaped 
ill l»lements which liave been trans- 
formed into stemmed arrowi)oints, 
leaving the convexity of the base un- 
changed. The points and edges seem 
to have had no share in the operation 
and they continue rough and sharp.

edges and points are tlie same as in other specimens. They are shoul- 
dered, but not barbed, and the stem at its base is the same as other 
stems; but instead of its edges being parallel and 
making a straight or square stem, they are convex 
and bring the base of the stem to a point. Fig. lOli is 
a good representfitive of this type. 
It is symmetrical ; the chipping is not 
fine, but fairly well done; the base 
and shoulders are square, the stem 
contracting by convex edges, and the 
base pointed. Fig. 1G3 is from Ten- 
nessee, while the former is from Ken- 
tucky; but the material of both is 
the same quality of gray flint, and as 
the two States are contiguous, we 
may easily suppose that the American 
Indian who made these implements 
was not governed by State lines, and 
both points may have come from the 
same quarry. The base is pointed, made so by convex 
edges. Fig. 1G4 has the same contracted stem, but its 
edges are straight and not convex 
and its base is pointed. It comes 
from a locality far distant from the 
others, namely, California, showing 
that these forms were not confined 
to a given locality. It is well chipped, symmetrically 
formed, but has the projecting horizontal barb, as was 
described in fig. 149. It is long and slender, and 
could have penetrated the flesh of 
the game or enemy a distance of 2^ 
inches without interference from 
these horizontal projections. 

Tlie type of which the author is 
now to speak has given him more 
trouble in its classification than any 
other, and yet he has concluded to 
classify it as a stemmed arrowpoint, shouldered but 
not barbed, and has put it in Class B. The blades 
may be thick or thin, wide or narrow, edges concave, 
straight, or convex, points sharp or blunt, and so 
through all the variations. The stem is formed by 
notches nuido in the edges near the lower end which, 
with the notch, forms the base of the arrowpoint. 

Fig. 165 is a representative of the type. It is of black flint ; its edges 
are convex, drawing gradually to a point; the base is straight and

as wide as the broadest part of the blade. Its base is fi)rmed by two 
notches made in each edge opposite each other and fonniug, .so far as 
concerns tlie edge.s, a groove around the implement which may have been 
utilized for fastening the arrow shaft by a ligature. These notches are 
about one-fourth of an inch wide and as much deep, and 
are distant from the base about one fourth ofan inch, so 
that they have been denominated in some other classi- 
fication as "notched on the edge near the base." This 
notching has loft the base its original width and 
unchanged, as though the notches had not been made 
nor the implement transformed from a leaf-shaped or 
possibly triangular arrowpoint into a stemmed one. 

Fig. 1C(J is much smaller than the former, but size 
does not seem to have aifected this type of arrowpoint 
more than it has the others. The implement is sym- 
metrical, edges are convex, and the outline can be 
traced past the notches to the base, and, l)ut for the notches, it would 
have been a leaf-shaped implement of Class 1>, pointed at one end and 
concave at the base. The notches are about one-fourth ofan inch wide 
and deep, and the distance from the base is about three-eighths of an 
inch. We will see in the next class how, evidently, some of these 
stemmed arrowpoints were made from leaf-shaped implements, by the 
introduction of these notches. In the present case 
the notches are horizontal and form shoulders but not 
barbs. In the next class (C) they will be at an up- 
ward angle toward the center, their shoulders form 
barbs, and they pass into that class and are not further 
noticed in this. 

Fig. 1(!7 is of gray Hint from Ohio. It is rather 
small and has the same horizontal notches, smaller 
than those noticed before, but the outline of the leaf- 
shaped implement is more apparent in it than in the 
oiliers. That it was originally a leaf-shaped imple- 
ment, transformed by the notches into a stemmed and 
shouldered arrowpoint, is satisfactorily shown from 
an inspection of the implement. It has the convex 
base which was referred to and described under lig. 
160 as polished or rubbed smooth on its edge. This 
peculiarity is wonderfully well represented in tlie 
specimen now under consideration. The edge of the 
base is blunt and smooth, while the edges and point 
of the blade are rough and sharp as any ever were. 
There are some peculiarities appertaining to the implements and objects 
of prehistoric man which, by reason of their repetition, have become 
accepted facts, the explanation of which has as yet defied all theories 
of the most inventive imagination. This is one.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 




Fig. 168, instead of beiiii? leaf-shaped as have been some of the fore- 
going:, was a triaiifiular anow-poiut. Its edges are straight, and, ap- 
])roa('liing each otlier, form the i)oint at an acute angle. The base is 
straight and square, but one-fourth of an inch above it toward the 
l)oint are two notches, one on each side, about one-fourth of an inch 
each way, which transform it from a triangular into 
a stemmed arrowpoint. 

Fig. 109, while belonging to the same class, has the 
peculiarity of three notches on the edges instead of 
one, as in all former illustrations. It is much larger 
than any of the others, its edges are straight, or 
nearly so, and, but for the notches whicli transform 
it into a stemmed implement, it would be nearly a 
triangnlar one. The base is straight and at right 
angles with the median line, the notches are about 
one fourth of an inch each way and separated from 
each other about one fourth of an inch. It would 
appear as though they might have been employed 
for three ligatures, or lor ligature in three jjlaces, 
the farthest of which would be about 1 J inches from 
the base, tlioreby giving the handle that much more 
firmness and solidity in its attachment. 

A type of arrowpoint belonging to this class has 
been found and identified by Dr. Abbott, with such 
l)eculiarities as demanded at his hands a separate 
and extended notice, which he gave in Primitive In- 
dustry.' An illustration of this implement is shown 
in Plate 34, fig. 7. Dr. Abbott believes in the exis- 
tence in America, and especially on the Delaware 
Eiver (the valley of the Delaware), of a Paleolithic 
civilization which, of course, antedated that of the 
Neolithic or American Indian civilization. All, or 
nearly all, the Paleolithic implements found in the 
glacial gravel Of tlie Delaware River at Trenton, New 
Jersey, have been of argillite. It is his belief that this 
material was used principally by Paleolithic man. The specimens un- 
der consideration are of argillite and much weathered, showing a high 
antiquity. They are now a light gray color, but originally and on the 
inside are coal-black. The stone of which they are made is hard, and 
they could be chipped to a sharp i)oint and edge. Their chipping has 
been rude and the flakes comparatively large. They are long ami 
narrow, their edges nearly straight, approaching until they form a 
point. The shoulders were nearly square, not barbed, the stem short, 
edges parallel, and base straight and square. Altogether it is rude 
and unattractive, but in its original condition of sharp point and

t'(li;cs it iiiigiit lijive been a very elTecti\e w Ciipon. Dr. Abbott asserts 
that the large pr<)i)orti()ii of these implements are foiiiid in the alluvial 
soil in proximity to the glacial gravel at a depth that proves their 
antiquity. Their number increases in proportion to the depth of the 
excavation for a certain distance, when they stoi), while the raleolithic 
imi)lements proper continue to a greater dei)th. Dr. Abbott believes 
these imi)lements to have been used as harpoons for the capturing of 
fish, and he cites, as evidence sui)porting his theory, the fact tliat tliey 
are nearly all found along the borders of the streams. He remarks 
the great sijnilarity of tin sc implements with those used for a similar 
purpose by the Eskimos, and cites corresjionding implements and lig- 
ures des(;ribed by Sir John Lubbock.' He propounds the theory 
whether the Eskimos may not have been driven down by the glaciers 
and occupied the territory of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, etc., 
or whether driven down or not, they may not, with their present love of 
cold or tor other reasons unknown, have dwelt near the foot of the 
glacier in these States and followed it up in its retreat north, until 
they came to occupy the present boreal region. It would seem to be 
indisputable that the territory around the feet of these glaciers was 
occupied by man, if it had not been prior to their descent. Tlie imi)le- 
ments found in the Trenton gravels would seem to show this. If this be 
accepted, the (question may be fairly asked, What became of this i)eople; 
who are their descendants; and, after the retreat of the glacier and the 
exposure of the country north, what course of departure, extension, 
or migration did their descendants take? Tliese theories are not yet 
demonstrated and may never be, but they are worthy of })r()f()UHd 
investigation and study.

The prehistoric man did not, in his manufacture of these imple- 
ments, divide them into classes. The diflerent forms were made 
according to the possibilities of tlie material, the dexterity .of the 
workman, and the exigencies of the situation. The classilication is 
now made solely for the i)urpose of enabling us in modern times to 
describe and understand them. Class C comprises those which have 
stems, shoulders, and barbs. The ditference between the present class, 
C, and the preceding, B, is that the shoulders in the former were hori 
zontal, at a right angle or more than a right angle to the inedinn line 

Preliiatorifi 'I'jiiics, p. 50;5, lij;. lilS. 




926 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

from the base upward. In the present class the point forming the shoul- 
der is brought downward toward the base, so that it forms less than a 
right angle to the median line; this has the effect of making the shoul- 
der au acute angle, and this angle forms the barb. The implements of 
this class, taken in their entirety, may be of different forms; sometimes 
they may be leaf shaped, sometimes triangular; they may have either 
convex, straight, or concave edges; the point may be sharp or blunt; 

the base may be concave, straight, 
or convex. All these may exist in 
this subdivision, provided they 
are stemmed, shouldered, and 
/5." ^4 barbed. Ko argument is neces- 

m sary to lustify a class which in- 

''"^ eludes so many forms as those 

\ just mentioned. If a separate 

division should be given to each 
of these different forms when ac- 
companied by barbs, the same 
should be done when Avithout 
barbs. This would create so many 
divisions as to become unrecog- 
nizable and itractically useless. 
This classification is based on the 
' salient points of difference. 

The first illustration (fig. 170) 
presents a type of barbs by which 
they can bo known and recognized 
throughout the description. It is 
a magnificent implement, translu- 
cent dark -brown chalcedony, and

J. L. DeWitt.) have been practically a leaf-shaped 

imjdement of Class B, one end 
pointed and the other convex. Whether it Avas originally thus, and 
afterwards transformed into a stemmed one, is unimportant and only a 
matter for conjecture. The notches have been made near the base, are 
V-shaped, and necessarily deep and wide; theyfornithe edges of the stem 
nearly parallel and make it straight, neither expanding nor contracting. 
The V-shai)ed notch causes the shoulder to descend so that its junction 
with the outer edge forms an acute angle, and this acute angle forms the 
barb of the implement. The benefit of the barb in an arrowpoiut or 
spearhead is that, having entered the tlesli of the game or enemy, 
the barb prevents its withdrawal, as with the barb of the fishhook.

That this form was somewhat a matter of taste, and uot always for the 
utilitarian ])arpose mentioned, is apparent upon a yhnice at this illus- 
tration and the two following. In these tliree speeiniens the size of 
the implement is so great and, eompared therewith, the barbs so smaH 
that they are insigniticaut in actual utility. The thrusting of either 
one of these large specimens into any 
known ganu' or enemy would be suf- 
ficient to kill the animal independent 
of the use of the barbs or the with- 
drawal of the weapon. It goes without 
saying that these, and possibly one 
other in this class, were too large for 
any possible use as arrows, and per- 
haps as knives, and if they had any 
utilitarian purpose it could only have 
been as a spearhead. It is a matter 
for conjecture and investigation 
whether they might not have served 
for ceremonial purposes, or as some 
insignia of authority or command, as 
the stafl^'of a marshal, the scepter of a 
monarch, or the mace in the House of 
Representatives of Congress. 

Fig. 171 is one of these remarkable 
implements. It is white or whitish 
translucent chalcedony, impure to be 
sure, but still fine enough with its 
extraordinary size to make it a mag- 
nificent implement. But for the barbs 
it would be assigned to the leaf-shaped 
Class B. Its edges are symmetrically 
convex and, converging, form the 
point. The notches forming the barbs 
ha\e been made perpendicularly up- 
ward from the base, and not, as usual, 
horizontally from the edge. The 
notches are half an inch wide and 
three fourths of an inch deep; they 
leave the barbs to be three-fourths of 
an inch long, descending perpendicu- 
larly almost even with the base. The 
base is straight and square; the stem has parallel edges, is straight 
and not pointed. The whitish chalcedony, the material of this si)eci- 
men, is not rare in the locality in which this was found (Shreveport, 
Louisiana), although the mine or (piarry from which the material comes 
has, it is believed, never yet been found. The author is the owner of

tlie point. Tlie twist is about equal to the thickness of the implement, 

and arises, not from the natural shape of the flake, but by chipping the 

edges all from one side. Whether this twist would give the missile a 

lotary motion as it was discharged from the bow, is a 

question examined in the division of peculiar forms, 

Class A, beveled edges, p. 931. 

Fig. 174 appears to have been one of the leaf-shaped 
implements of Class B. It has a long, fine ])oint, edges 
convex, base the same, with narrow notches in the edge 
near the base. The edge of the convex base has been 
ground down or worn smooth as de- 
scribed ill figs. 160 and 161 of Class 
B, stemmed, Divi.sion III, p. 921. 

Fig. 175 has con vex edges converg- 
ing symmetrically to the point, the 
base is slightly convex, while the 
notches which have made it into a 
stemmed and barbed implement are 
at the corners formed by the Junction 
of the edges with the base. The V-shaped notches 
make the expanding base, and change the shoulders 
into barbs. This specimen is from a mound near 
Naples, Illinois, excavated by Mr. J. G. Henderson. 
The mound and the associated objects 
^ are described in the Smithsonian Re- 

port of 1882, where this is fig. l-'i a (p. 
696). The material is translucent pale brown chalce- 
dony. This is the finest specimen of flint chipping in 
the U. S. National Museum. Tliere may have been 
others exceedingly fine and highly interesting, and it 
may be difficult to draw lines of com- 
parison between the various degrees 
of fineness, but the author has never 
seen anything showing a higher de- 
gree of mechanical art and manual 
dexterity in flint chipping. 

Fig. 176, though reduced in size, is 
of sufficient weight to give momen- 
tum to the arrow, and will probably secure greatest 
flight. Its edges are symmetrically convex and, con- 
verging, form the point. The base is slightly convex, 
while the notches which form the barbs are in the edge 
near the base. 

Fig. 177 has edges slightly convex, which come together at the point 
with a wide angle, making the implement of considerable breadth 
in proportion to its length. The stem is contracting and the base

pointed. The iiotclies which have formed the barbs have been made in 
theLase and not in the edge. They are V-shaped and are ])eri)endicu- 
lar to the i)Uine of the implement. The barbs continue on the line ot 
the outside edges, and the widest i)lace is across their extreme points. 
The material is reported as pale-brown flint, bnt it has the peculiarity 
of a brilliant shining luster resembling the brightest ])atina. Whether 
it is reallj' patina, or only vitreous material, the author has not been 
able to determine. The specimen is too precious to be broken in order 
to show its interior. 

Fig. 178 is barbed and, therefore, belongs to this class. It is broad- 
est near the point. Its edges are of irregular convexity; there have 
been some others of much the same form as this, but their edges have 
been straight where this is convex, aiul instead of a curve there was 
a distinct angle, but these are considered only the peculiarities of the 
workman and to have served no particular end, while their rarity will 
not permit their being assigned a division by themselves. 

Fig. 179 is one of the beautiful jiale-greeu jasper specimens ot 
diminutive size, delicate stem, and long, projecting, finely pointed 
barbs, peculiar to the Pacific coast, coming mostly Irom Oregon. It 
appears much smaller than its dimensions given in the legend would 
indicate. This is caused by its delicacy and fineness. Italy produces 
the only arrowpoints which compare with those of the Pacific coast 
in these fine qualities. The reader is referred to Plate 36 for other 
specimens. 

DIVISION IV— PECULIAR FORMS. 

This division includes those specimens which have such peculiarities 
as distinguish and separate them from the standard tvpes. If the 
distribution of these specimens was general, or if they were found in 
numbers approximately equal with the others, they would themselves 
become standard types and each require a division of its own. It is 
because they do not belong to standard types, pnd are restricted in 
number or locality, that they are assigned to this division. 

CLASS A. — BEVELED EDGES. (Plate 37.) 




The blades of the ordinary arrowpoint are usually chipped from both 
sides so that the edges are formed on the central line, and a cross sec- 
tion is elliptical. This Class A is peculiar in that the chipping by 
which the edge is formed is all done from one side, and the edge is 
thrown or beveled to the plane of the other side. A cross section will

be rhomboidal, the two loiiij sides being the width, and tlie two short 

sides or edges beinj^: the thickness of the bhule. 

It was for a long time believed that these 
bevel-edged arrowheads were simply freaks 
of the workmen, aud were without sigiiitica- 
tion or intention for particular purpose. In- 
deed that belief has not entirely i)assed away. 
Since beginning this paper the author, in order 
to demonstrate the truth of the matter, 
inaugurated a series of experiments. Select- 
ing from the I\Iuseum collection a dozen or 
more representative specimens, he attached 
to each an arrow shaft, smooth, straight, with- 
out feathering, and the same size throughout. 
Eepairing with these to the top of the tower 
of the Smithsonian building, he began by 
letting them drop straight to the ground, 
carried only with their own gravity, and next 
launching them in the air in every direction. 
He found a universal rotation. He pushed 
his experiments further by arranging these 
specin)ens in a sort of clamp of wire, the 
ends of which embraced the ends of the arrow- 
points, care being taken to put the point of 
contact as near the center of gravity as i)os- 
sible. Thus held, the suspended or clamped 
implement was free to rotate longitudinally in 
either direction on the application of the 
slightest force. This machine was then used 
by j)ushing it with its clamped arrowpoint 
rapidly through the water in a large tub, and 
it was discovered that the resistance of the 
water produced a rotary motion of the imple- 
ment. A more conclusive test was made at a 
machine shop where the arrowpoint, hung as 
aforesaid, was presented point foremost to the 
pipe of air from the driving fan, when the 
current immediately set it revolving. When 
the force of the current was increased, it in- 
creased the rapidity of the rotary movement. 
When the arrowpoint was turned about so 
as to present its base to the current of air, no 

rotary motion was produced. 
These experiments were extended and continued to include any and 

every kind of bevel-edged arrow])oint and spearhead, always with the 

same result. It was obvious that the arrowpoint at rest ijreseuted to

a rapidly inoviiin cuirent of air would have the same effect as an 

ariowpoiiit shot tVoni the bow. ]\Iost of the speciiiiens of bevel-ed<4ed 

arrowpoints and si)earheads are chamfered one way, so that the 

movement usually Avas from right to left, contrary to 

the motion of the sun. All specimens of this kind 

employed in onr e.xperiments had that rotary moticm 

from right to leit A few specimens, however, aie 

made with the bevel the other way, and when they 

were i)resented to the current of air their rotary 

motion was in the opposite direction. 

It is proper to add that these experiments were 
l)ushed to such extent and in such number, with 
such repetition of the same result, as to be conclusive 
that, whatever may have been the intention of the 
maker of the ariowi)oints, the fact was that in their 
tlight through the air the beveled 
A edges i)roduced the rotary motion. 

.: '^ While it would appear that this 

■\ rotary motion must have been in- 

i^^M tended bv the arroM' maker when he 

' •<- ' ' • made the beveled edge, yet the diffi- 

culty of solution of tlie problem why he made it thus 
is iiinch increased when we consider the greater ease, 
the less labor, and the increased facility with which 
he might have accomplished the same rotary motion 
by twisting the feathers on the arrow shaft. Yet we 
find t his exceeding rare ; out of a thou- 
sand arrow shafts in the U.S. i^atioual ^ 
iMnseum not more than a dozen have /"^v 
been found with twisted feathering. 
The bevel-edge^l arrowi)oint is i)e- 
culiar in its distribution. It is con 
fined to the interior and southern United States. 

Fig. 180 (Cat. No. ISSOO, U.S.X.M.) is one of these 
bevel-edged arrowpoints, vrhich, on account of its size, 
form, and definitely beveled edges, has been chosen 
and is here rei)resented full size as a (diaracteristic 
bevel-edged weapon. It is of light-brown flint and 
comes from Elkton, Giles County, Tennessee. Its base 
is convex and smoothed, as usual. It is notched, 
shouldered, and l)arbed and, but for the i)eculiarity 
of its beveled edges, would be i)la('ed in Class C, 
Division III. 

Fig. 181 is the size of the average arrowpoint. It is 3^^ inches long, 
1^ inches wide, and from this size they descend to the smallest. The 
edges of this specimen are nearly straight, the base is concave, and the

notches which fonii it are iiuide in the edges near the base. The angle 
of the slionldeis Ibi lu tiie usual barb ; the iirojecting- corners of the base 
may also form anotlier pair of barbs. If the arrow shaft used on this 
si)ecinien should be small in diameter, the points of the base would 
project beyond it, and thus form a double set of barbs. 

Fig. 182 has the appearance of gray tlint, but it is of translucent 
crystalline structure, and an inspection identifies it as chalcedony or 
chalcedcMiic'tlint. Its edges are curved, a union of concave and con- 
vex, making them slightly ogee. The base is straight, the barbs are 
long and thin, and, what is rare, are nearly the same size their entire 
length. The notch which forms them begins at the corners of the base 
and edge and, ascending at an angle of about 45 degrees toward the 
center of the implement, is one-half an inch long and only one eighth 
of an inch thick or wide. 

Fig. 183 is from Kentucky, gray flint, stemmed, shouldered, and 
barbed, and twisted to the left. The specimens of this class average 
from one-fourth to three-eighths of an inch in thickness, and are of 
all sizes and lengths. Reference is made to Plate 37 for other specimens. 

Rev, J, G. Wood,' author of The Natural History of ]Man, describes 
arrows with a rotary motion, which he says are used with theblowgun: 

Rotary luotiou waa commiiuicated to tlie arrows iu their flijjlit by attaching to 
their lower ends two feathers — one from the right wing, the other from the left wing 
of a liird — which acted obliqnely against the air and thus imparted the rotary motion 
required,

These may be ol the usual types as 
to form, stem, barb, etc., but the ser- 
rated edge is a peculiarity sufficiently 
marked to prevent their being as- 
signed to their respective types. The 
edges are jagged like sawteeth, and 
the serrations about the same size 
and frequency as a moderately fine 
handsaw. They are not the result of 
hazard in chipping, but are made by 
pressure with a pointed flaker exerted 
on the edges from alternate sides and 
at intervals, and are done with a 
purpose.

ARROWPOINTS, SPEARHEADS, AND KNIVES.

Figs. 184 and 185 are specimens of this class. Both are from the 
Pacific coast. The former is stemmed and shouldered, witli pointed 
base, and would belong to CUiss B, stemmed; while the latter is leaf- 
shiiped, with convex base, and would belong to (Jlass B, leaf-shaped, 
but for its serrated edges. The edges of the former are serrated 
from the shoulder to the poiut; those of the latter have but three ser- 
rations near the base, but the implement is so small that slight entry 
into the flesh brings the serrations into use. A series of this class is 
represented on Plate 38, figs. 1-9. 

CLASS C. — BIFIRCATED STEMS. (Plate 38, figs. 10-19.) 




These may be of standard types of any class of the stemmed division, 
either shouldered or barhed, with edges concave, straight, or convex; 
but, as in the class with serrated edges, here the bifurcated stem is a 
peculiarity so marked as to transfer it to this division (fig. 186). 

Usually the bifurcated stem is neither expanding nor contracting, 
but is straight, with i)arallel edges. What would otherwise be the base 
is here occupied by a V-shaped notch. It is made by 
the same method as is the notch forming the shoulder, 
namely, chipping the flakes always in the same place 
by pressure exerted alternately from each side. 

The flakes may have converted the former straight 
base into a V-shaped notch, which must have served 
for the insertion of the split shaft or handle. When 
shafted or handled the bifurcation would be hid, but 
it would seem to have afforded a firmer fastening. 

From observations of specimens, it appears that ar- 
rowpoints of this size need not have been fastened firml}', 
but were as frequently lashed so as to wobble and pos- 
sibly be detached from the shaft and left in the wound.' 
As the only attainment of the bifurcated stem ap- 
pears to have afforded a firmer fastening (which was 
not needed for arrows, but was for knives), it is suggested that these 
may have been intended for knives and not for arrows. The well defined 
difference between the two classes and their existence and employment

'Cases are cited in the works on arrow wounds where the arrowpoiiit, having 
entered the body, the foroible withdrawal of the shaft has left the head or pile in 
the body. Many such cases have been observed by the surgeons of the Army and 
reported to the Surgeon-General's Office, while the remains themselves have been 
sent to and are now to be seen in the Army Medical Museum.

in tlie same loccility, with a i)repoiiderance in number of tliose not 
bifurcated, points to the same conclusion. If the shaft or handle was 
cut out so as to leceive the stem and also to lit the bifurcation, and 
then pressed in hard and lashed with sinews after the manner of 
arrowpoints, one can easily see that the bifurcation would increase the 
tirinness of tlie blade in its handle. Reference is made to Plate .'i8, 
Nos. 10-19, for other si)eciniens.

These are peculiar in that they are restricted to certain localities. 
Sir John Evans says they are found in some parts of England and 
Ireland. A beautiful specimen is figured by him/ found by Canon W. 
Green well at Eudstone, near Bridlington, which is here reproduced as 
fig. 187. They much resemble the Queen's "broad arrow." 

Our interest in this class arises from the 
fact that, while they are confined to-restricted 
localities in Europe as mentioned, they 
should have appeared in America in an 
equally circumscribed area, namely, the State 
of Georgia. Figs. 20 to 23 on Plate 38 are of 
this class and form part of the McGlashan 
and Steiner collections from that State. 

De Mortillet mentions them and calls them 
"pointes de fleche a barbelures Equarries," 
and assigns them to the first epoch of bronze, 
the Morgieu. He figures one ^ in the Musee 
St. Germain as from the north of Ireland 
and collected by Sir John Evans. It has no 
stem, its base is concave, and the barbs are 
long, with parallel edges and square ends. 
Others, from Loir-et-Cher, have stems. The edges of the barbs are 
parallel and the ends are straight, but instead of being square — that 
is, at right angles — one is oblique inward and the other outward. 
Kemark this difterence in Figs. 20-23 of Plate 38.

Mr. J. A. Mc^Jiel for its specimens, which have been 
described aiul tigured by Dr. W. H. Holmes.' 

The larger ones were of fine-grained, slaty-looking 
tufa, while the smaller were of flinty jasper of reddish 
and yellowish hues. 

Fig. 188 is one of these small Jasper specimens from 
Chiriqui. They are made entirely by chipping, and as 
the material is hard and refractory, the workmanshii) 
is rude. This form is shown in Plate 39, figs. 1 to 4.

Fig. 180 (a, h) rei)re3ents two specimens of this chiss, and figs. 5 to 8 
on Plate 39 represent others. They are thin, almost flake-like in 
appearance, no', made pointed, nor are the edges worked down by sec- 
ondary chipping. The cutting edge is at the front, at the broadest 
end, chisel-shaped — tranchant transversal — and, thus propelled, will 
make a wound large enough for the arrow shaft to follow. Whether 
these were really arrowpoints, or were used as knives, is a disputed 
question. De Mortillet devotes Plate XXXIX of the Musee Prchis- 
torique to them, showing fifteen illustrations (figs. 319-334). One of 
them, from Denmark, is still lashed to its shaft or handle by threads 
or fibers of bark. The instrument (fig. 190a) is smal> enough for an

was broken before being phieed in its grave can not be known. 

Fig. 190 (b) represents another specimen of the same class, from a 
neolithic grave at Montiguy TEngrain (Aisne) France. It is inserted 
in a horn handle and shows this particular specimen to have served as 
a knife, possibly for trepanation, and not as an arrow. 

Similar specimens have been found throughout western Europe. 
A cache of some thousand was opened and is now displayed in the 
museum at Copenhagen. Another was described by M. Edmond Vielle.' 

There is an implement peculiar to Scandinavia of the same form as the 
tranchant transversal. They have been called in French " tranchet." 
From their resemblance to the tranchant transversal they are sup- 
posed to have been the same implement and intended for the same use, 
but this conclusion has not been accepted. The principal difterence 
between those of Scandinavia and of other countries is their respective 
sizes. Those of Scandinavia are larger, so much so as to interdict all 
possible use as arrowpoints or spearheads. Many of them are large 
enough to have required to be held in the hand for use. It is the 
accepted belief that they served rather as hatchets, and that their 
cutting was done by strokes as in cliopping. It is also charged that 

they belonged to au earlier epoch than their 

f smaller partners, this having been deter- 
mined by the conditions and stratum of their 
\-2-j-".'--^/ deposit and the objects with which they 
^^^^1 were found associated. No opinion is ex- 
^^^ pressed as to the correctness of this belief 
^"""""^ of the use of the tranchet. As much as can 
be said at the present is a warning that an

use of the small tranchant transversal as an 
arrowpoint or spearhead, it must be admitted that they have been found 
in such numbers in numerous and widely separated localities, and 
extending over such an area of Europe as to make it difficult to deter- 
mine for what purpose they were intended, if not for that. 

The greatest contention as to its possible use grows out of its shaft 
or handle and the mode of attachment, by which it is sought to be 
determined whether it was used as an arrowpoint or spearhead, or as a 
knife; but all this di.scussiou is of slight value viewed from the stand- 
I)oint of this paper, for it must be admitted that these implements 
were prehistoric and intended for a use involving cutting, scraping, or 
piercing. The piercing use would decide it to be an arrowpoint or 
spearhead, which would naturally require an attachment to an arrow 
or spear shaft. But suppose that they would be found attached to a

shorter shaft or liaiidle, then they might serve as knives and as such 
wouhl he entitled to consideration here. This sa[)poseil difference iu 
the shaft or handle applies equally to otlier implements whicli have 
passed throushout all time as arrowpoints or spearheads. For, as has 
been sliown in its appiopriate phice, the particular use of the ordinary 
arrowpoint or spearhead is to be determined by the kind of shaft or 
handle to which it was attached. The size of the implement made no 
difference; if it was attached to a long and stout shaft it was a spear, 
if to a shorter one, it was a javelin, if still shorter and smaller, an arrow, 
while a still shorter one became a handle and 
determined the implement to be a knife. 

As the tranchant transversal must have had 
some one of these kinds of handles or shafts, 
the shaft or handle, and not the head, deter- 
mined its use. It is therefore repeated that, 
in an 3^ event and without deciding the varions 
contentions whether the tranchant transversal 
was nsed as an arrow|)oint, a spearhead, or a 
knife, it is still ap])ropriate to be noticed in this 
paper. It may have been a combination imple- 
ment and served in many capacities. One sug- 
gested by the author as extremely j^robable is 
that of a surgical instrument and specially 
used in trepanation, of which we liave seen so 
many instances in the prehistoric epoch to 
which these implements belong. 

The U. S. j^ational Museum possesses (Wil- 
son collection) a series of these imijlements 
from the station of Teil (Loir et-Cher, France), 
collected by M. A. C. Bonnet, of Paris. He 
has a large collection, having excavate<l the 
station and secured its entire contents. He 
says the station at Teil was evidently inhabi- 
ted by i)rehistoric man for a long time. It 
was on the side of a hill looking toward the 
south, with a stream of water at the foot, and 
had everything to recommend it as a pUice of habitation. There are 
many localities in western Europe wherein these imphiuients have been 
found, but they do not require notice or description. 

A vertebra, from a grotto near Courjeonnet, in the valley of the Petit 
Morin (Marne), France, was pierced by a dint arrowpoint of the type 
tranchant transversal. Tiie grotto in which it was found was sepul- 
chral. All the bones were human, regularly disposed, and their ana- 
tomical relations respectively preserved. There would seem to be no 
doubt that this was used as a projectile. Dr. Hamy, describing the 
excavations at Les Kyzies in his " Palcontologie Humaine," says: 

There are very small arrowpoints, triangular or flattened, filed at their extremitios, 
which form a sharp edge. In figs. 63, 64 one of these points is shown still inserted 
in the lumbar vertebra of a young reindeer.

This means arrowi)oints tranchant transversal, altlumgh tli<» name had 
nut tlien been given to them. 

The specimens from Petit Morin confirm Hamy's opinion and the 
tlieory that tliey wore used as arrowpoints or projectiles, A skull was 
found in one of the grottoes of \'illev('nard, where it, with the other 
portions of tlu' skeleton, were in tlieir normal position, apparently 
unchanged in position since the day of burial. A i)ortion of the skull 
was decayed so tliat possible wounds were destroyed, but inside of the 
skull, so placed as to be impossible of entry except through the bone, 
were found three arrowpoints tranchant transversal. Another of these 
arrowjjoints was found, still at Villevenard, inserted between two dorsal 
vertebra'. In a burial cave containing thirty subjects, all regularly 
dis])0sed and the whole grave filled solid, were found no less than 
seventy-three arrowpoints tranchant transversal. They were disposed 
in the head and trunk and bore such relation to the skeletons as to show 
that they had been intimately associated with the body, if not inserted 
in it, at the time of burial. Baron de Baye found nearly two thousand 
of these si)ecimens, tranchant transversal, in the grottoes explored by 
him, and it is impossible to believe, after the evidences found, tliat they 
had not been used as projectiles, whether as arrowpoints or spearheads 
may be left undetermined. 

Those who are desirous of contiiuiing the investigations into this 
subject are referred to the authorities:

A communication by M. Dumont ' argues the affirmative of the propo-

continued use among thesivages. The same idea is elaborated by 
Dr. Cai)itan in the study mentioned.

Salmon, and "Chisel-shaped," bj' Sir Johu Evans, Ancient Stone 
Implements, etc., p. 329, fig. 272 from Egypt, and p. 352, tig. 342, from 
Scotland. 

Two ancient specimens of this type, undonbtedly used as arrows, and 
coming from France, are shown (tigs. 19<), 197) in the chapter on 
'Arrow wounds,' as having been tired, the first into a liuman vertebra 
and the second into a human tibia. While the drawing of these illus- 
tiations may not represent the tranchant transversal \\ itli exactness, 
there is no doubt, both from description and examination, that they are 
of this type. 

CLASS C — PDLISHKU SLATK. (l'late3'J, lig.S. il-13.) 




Specimens of this type are shown on a portion of Plate 39 (figs. 9-13). 
They are peculiar in that they are found and appear to have been made 
and used in a restricted locality on the northern Atlantic coast. They 
are of slate, have been ground or polished on both sides, and made to 
a smooth edge. 

Knives of slate, with a circular cutting edge, fashioned like a sad- 
dler's knife, have been found in the same region, where they are said to 
have been used as fish knives. Both spearheads and knives are iden- 
tical with Eskimo forms and would suggest possible contact; but it is 
remarkable, and as yet unexplained, why this material should hav'e 
been preferred for arrowpoiuts or spearheads. There is no lack of the 
usual material in this portion of the country. Mount Kineo furnishes 
a porphyritic felsite (Mount Kineo fiint), which was manufactured into 
arrowpoints that have been distributed up and down the coast for a 
long distance. 

CLASS H. — ASYMMETUIC. ( I'kltO 39, ligS. 15-19. ) 




A series of asymmetric arrowpoints is represented in a portion of 
Plate 39 (figs. 15-19). Their lopsided form shows their i)eculiarity. 
It is curious that they should have beeu made in a. way which appar- 



942 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

eiitly destroys their effectiveness as a itrojectile. It is suggested that 
they may have beeu fastened to a short handle after the fashion of a 
knife and then used as concave scrapers; tliat is to say, for the same 
])urpose as the inii)lements in Plate 26. The convex edge may have 
been used as a knife. 

The long, straight implement (Plate 39, fig. 15) is quite different from 
these, and yet is asymmetric and to l)e placed in this class. It belongs 
to the Solutrt'cn epoch of the Paleolitliic pt^riod and represents the 
earliest examples of supposed arrowpoints or spearheads, although 
they may have been, and probably were, used as harpoons; they como 
from the well-known (tavern district on the Vczcre (Dordognei, France. 
The U. S. National Museum (Wilson collection) possesses two speci- 
mens of the same style, but smaller. The Solutreen epoch was prover- 
bial ibr the excellence of its Hint chipping, and these are representative 
examples. 

The Steiner colle(;tion from Burke County, Georgia, contains a num- 
ber of asymmetric arrowpoints or spearheads. Figs. IG and 17, Plate 
39, and fig. 195 belong to that collection. They are of the gray flint 
with yellow patina so common in that country, of which we have so 
many representatives in the Steiner and McGlashan collections. The 
remark above made as to the impossibility of their use as projectiles 
and the probability of their employment as scrai»ers or knives with 
short handles, api)lies to these specimens. Others shown in the plate 
as belonging to this class have great similarity with the implements to 
be described in the succeeding chapter on knives. Their asymmetric 
and lopsided form, the characteristics of their point, and the sharpened 
edge upon the one side only, the stem suitable for handling, are all 
evidence of the non-employment of these implements as arrows or 
spears, or as projectiles. 

CLASS I. — cnuous I'ORMS. (Plate 39, fig. II; Pbiti' 40.) 





There have been discovered in different (;ountries, implements which 
have resemblance to arrowpoints and spearheads in material, method 
and style of manufacture, and general appearance, though by reason of 
the peculiarity of their form are totally unfitted for any projectile pur- 
pose and, indeed, it is impossible tliat they should have served as such. 
Plate 39, fig. 14, shows one of this class, and Plate 40 represents a

series of these curious forms. The latter is takeu from the author's 
paper on Prehistoric Art/ where it is thus introduced: 

It has bceu remarked many times tlironghout this paper that tlie prehistoric 
artist possessed sufticieut confidence in his ability, and disi)hiyed such control 
over his tools and materials as enabled him to make any- 
thing out of Hint that his fancy might dictate; he did not 
confine himself to utilitarian objects, but was an artist in 
the true sense of the word; that is to say, he dealt with 
art for arfs sake, for the sake of making something which 
should be beautiful and whoso only ])urpose, according to 
the canon of art laid down by Sir John Collier, would be 
to please his eye and to gratify his taste. The prehistoric 
artist in tlint obtained, in some way, we know not how, 
possibly by stxidy and contemplation, possibly by education, 
possibly by accident, an ideal which he re])roduced in flint. 
Plate 29 [Plate 40] represents twenty objects taken at hazard 
from the interior of the I'nited States, principally from the 
Ohio and Mississippi valleys, all of flint, in curious and rare 
forms, believed to be entirely without utility and solely to 
gratify an artistic desire. None of them are arrow or spear 
heads, and none of them appear to have been made for any 
service. They are the work of a master who, conscious of his 
ability, is playing with his art. One rejiresents a bird, one a 
snake, one an outstretched beaver-skin, two of them, by stretch 
of the imagination, might represent four-footed animals; the 
rest have no likeness to any known object. All of them are 
worked from flint or some similar stone; one is of obsidian; 
they are represented abont natural size. This series shows 
what the prehistoric artist in flint was able to do in the 
management and control of his tools and materials in making 
fanciful objects.

These curious forms are not peculiar to the United 
States. They are found in England,^ and have also 
been found scattered through France, Switzerland, and 
Italy, though rarely. 

Fig. 191 is one of the peculiar forms restricted in 
number and locality. Its restri(;tions in botli these 
regards are so close that the author has not deemed 
it necessary to assign it a class or give it a name. 
These forms are confined to Scandinavia, and are 
extremely rare even in that country. The specimen 
figured is from Sweden, was procured by the author, 
and forms part of the collection in the U. S. National 
iNInseum. It is an arrowpoint of bone, sharpened 
to a fine point, is extremely hard and stiff, and 
could pierce equal to any flint weapon. Either 
side is opened with a deep and narrow groove into wh.ich have 
been inserted tiny bits of flint flakes, with sharp cutting edges, fas-

teiied with hitiuiien or jxuni. 8oiiic of tliese bits of flint have been lost 
out of the original specimen, but cnougii remain to show its chaiacter 
and effectiveness as a weapon.' Some of the bits of flint suitable for 
such use have been found and are displayed in the Museum of the 
Ko^al Irish Academy.- 

M. de Mortillet presents, i:i " Musce Prehistorique,"' eight illustra- 
tions of spear and lance heads with two poniards, varying in length. 
Six are from France, of which three are the Hint of Grand Pressigny. 
He makes the following remarks as to their differentiation: 

Lanceheads aud iioiiiards of tliut iu Fraucc arc sinootli on one side, the thipping 
beiug always done on the other. In Scaudiuavia they are chipped on both sides. 
In France the objects intended for knives have no secondary chipping .it all. The 
cutting edge is left smooth as it was struck from the core; in other words, it is 
8im])ly a sharjj-edged Hake. 

In his estimation an object from I-'rance like the Mousterien ])oint 
(tigs. 3, 4), untouched on one side but wrought to an edge on tl>e other, 
would l)e a spear or lance head, while a flake like that from Grand 
Pressigny (Plate 7, tig. 4), sharp but untouched on the edge, would be 
a knife. His Plate XLII contains illustrations of javelin points, large 
arrowpoints, of which five are from Francje (four of flint and one of 
bone), three are from the United States, the others from Kussia and 
Scandinavia. His Plates XLIII and XLIV contain 41 illustrations of 
arrowpoints, of nearly every form and style (figs. 365-405). France 
has 21 representatives, Italy 4, Switzerland and Denmark each 3, 
Ireland, Portugal, and America each 2, Prussia, Sweden, and Algeria 
each 1. These are of the usual tyi)es, though some may have ])artic- 
ular forms peculiar to certain countries. His Plate XLY contains 
four illustrations of the mode of fastening the arrowpoints to the shaft, 
three from the lake dwellings of Switzerland, aud one from California; 
two are of stone and one of bone.

An anomaly iu arrowj^oints should not be overlooked. One of the 
prehistoric implements of America is that which usually has been 
called the perforator or drill, though sometimes, jocularly, ''hairpin.'' 
It consists of the bore or pile, which is round or nearly so, pointed as 
though suitable for drilling or boring, with a stem or base after the fash-

ion of arrowpohits. It has Uvsually been supposed that this spreading 
base was to be hehl between the tliumb and 
tingers, gindet fasliion, and used as a drill. 
Sojue of these implements appear to have 
been made primarily for this purpose, while 
others have the full and complete base, stem, 
shoulders, and sometimes barbs, of the stem 
end of an arrowpoint, and of these it has 
always been said or supposed, that the per- 
forator or drill had a secondary use, and was 
possibly a broken arrowpoint. The blade is 
chipped away on either edge until the pile or 
bore is very nearly round and quite pointed. 
Tliese have never been classed as arrowpoints 
or spearheads, but it is curious to remark that 
the only wounds shown in the two human 
skulls in the U. S. National ^Museum should 
have been nuide by stone implements or arrow- 
points of this peculiar kind. Reference is 
made to tigs. 198 and -00, where the skulls 
are represented with the wound and weapon 
as originally found, but the latter are also 
withdrawn and shown in their entirety. 
\A"itli this apparently conclusive evidence of 
their use as arrowpoints, they can not be 
omitted from this classitication. 

The bow and arrow as a projectile engine 
comprises several parts. This paper has 
treated only one, the arrowpoint or j^ile, as it 
is called in archery, for the reason that the 
investigation has been confined in point of 
time to the prehistoric, and all or nearly all 
parts of the engine, except the stone arrow- 
point, have decayed or been destroyed by 
lapse of time. Bows with their strings, arrow 
shafts with their feathering, spear shafts, and, 
with a few excepted illustrations to be given, 
knife handles, have all perished. Dr. Otis T. 
Mason says:' 

Of the ancient inhabitants of this continent the 
perishable material of arrows constituting the shaft 
and other parts has rotted and left ns naught but the 
stone heads. Even those of bone and wood and other 
material have passed away, so as to leave the im- 
pression that the Indians of this eastern region used 
only stone; but all authorities agree that other sub- 
stances were employed fjuite as fre(iu('ntly as the last 
named.

946 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

A single specimen of a bow was preserved in tlie bog peat of the 
lake dwellers and lias been found and exhibited to the eye of man — 
"only this, and nothing more." Fig. 192 represents the original of 
this specimen, now in the museum in Zurich, Switzerland, and found 
by Jacob Messikomnier in the peat bog which was originally the lake 
dwelling of Uobenhausen. The author has visited this station more 
than once and has found many pieces of wood well preserved. The 
piles themselves in this, as in all other pile dwellings, are of wood, and 
almost every museum possesses specimens in certain stages of preser- 
vation. The work on this specimen identifies it specifically as a 
bow. The end "horns" show the notch for the retention of the bow 
string, while the center has a certain style of decoration. 

Those interested in ancient bows, or bows of primitive, not i»re- 
historic, peoples are referred to Doctor Mason's paper. 

IX. KNIVES. 



Mention has i)reviously been made of the possibility of the use by 
prehistoric man of the implements described in this paper for other 
puri)oses than as arrowpoints or spearheads (pp. <S23, 935, 938, 977). 
The importance of the subject requires further investigation. 

Reference to the classification of these implements will show many 
varieties, such as leaf shaped, triangular, stemmed, notched, shoul- 
dered, and barbed, yet all these are variations only in details, the gen- 
eral form, the material, and the processes of manufacture being the 
same. Theprincii)al differences between the various kinds, those most 
affecting their use and purpose, are in size and weight. It seems 
strange that implements of such similarity in all functional character- 
istics should differ so much in size and weight, and it is unreasonable to 
believe that imidements of such extremes — (me very light and small, the 
other large and heavy — could have been employed in the same manner 
or have served the same purpose. It would indeed be strange if imple- 
ments 15 or more inches long, as the Arvedsen specimen (Plate 65), or 
those in Plates 01 and 04 in this paper and Plate 27 in "Prehistoric 
Art," over 12 inches in length, should have been employed in the same 
manner and for the same purpose as the small obsidian or jasper 
"jewel points" from California and Oregon. Yet these are of the same 
material, have the same style and mode of manufacture, their principal, 
if not their only, difference being in size and weight. 

These implements, with their extreme variations, are not confined to 
any particular locality or country. The large, finely wrought, leaf- 
shaped blades have been found in Mexico as well as in central France,

ami the small "•Jewel points'' are found in California and Orejion as 
well as in Italy, with a spriukling of each scattered over western 
Europe. 

The handle or shaft to which these implements were fastened and 
with which they were used may assist us in their classilication. Imajiine 
a hickory sapling 10 or 12 feet long, which can best be understood by 
the average American boy when described as a "hoop-pole," cut, 
smoothed, seasoned, toughened, or hardened by tire, li inches in diam- 
eter at the butt and tapering to a half or three quarters of an inch at 
the top, into whi(;h one of the small Jewel })oints had been inserted. 
This implement, held in the hands and used for thrusting, would 
undoubtedly be called a spear or lance. If the length of the handle 
was reduced to i or 6 feet, it would be a javelin suitable for throwing; 
with a light reed or cane shaft 2 or 3 feet in length it would be an 
arrow; and with a handle, however large, if but 3 or 4 inches in length, 
the implement would become a knife (Plates 41-43). The same (^assi- 
fication ai)plies to a larger implement attached to a larger or longer 
shaft equally well as to the smaller implement with the shorter shaft. 

The foregoing in its application to i)rehistoric implements is, to a 
certain extent, theoretical, for their shalts or handles were of wood 
and by lapse of time have decayed and are lost. We know this as 
a matter of fact. Among the hundreds of collectors throughout the 
United States, where tens of thousands of ancient arrowpoints and 
spearheads have been collected, we have no record of any of them hav- 
ing beeu found with handle or shaft attached. This is not strange nor 
is it peculiar to these implements. The polished stone hatchets doubt- 
less had wooden handles, yet of all of the thousands found, there have 
been less than a dozen reported in tlie United States with their wooden 
handles.' Like the arrowpoint or spearhead, it is usual to find them 
without any trace of a handle. Objects of wood used in i)rehistoric 
times have rarely beeu found, and the instances tliereof are usually con- 
fined to those either protected by water ^ or those in the sandy desert, 
where there was no moisture to cause decay.^ 

There are some of these implements with their luuKHes which, being 
fonnd under these favorable conditions, or belonging to modern sav- 
ages, have been preserved for inspection. Col. P. 11. Kay, in his 
investigations and collections among the Hupa Indians,^ reported a 
number of leaf-shaped implements, which, if found alone, would have 
passed for spearheads, as have thonsands of others of similar form 
collected throughout all that portion of the world occupied by pre- 
historic man. The implements fonml by Colonel Kay are now in the 
U. S. National Museum under Professor Mason's (duirge (Plate 41).

948 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

The first series consists of eijiiit specimens. The material is obsi<lian 
or clialcedony viirying- from dark-brown to a dull blue, with veins of 
blue throughout the brown. The blades vary from 4 to 5| inches 
in length, from 1| to 2'| inches in width, and are from t to ^ inch 
thick. Handles of pine, from 4i to 6J inches, were attached to all of 
them. Five of these were glued or gummed, three were lashed. 
Another of these blades, similar in all respects to the former, was 
obtained by Colonel Ray, but the wooden handle was replaced by a 
wrapping of otter skin. The blade is 7^ by 1§ by ^ inches. Speci- 
mens of the foregoing are set forth in Plate 41, a reference to which will 
make the description clear. The smaller specimen in this i)late repre- 
sents a series of knives obtained by MaJ. J. W. Powell from the Pai 
Utes. The latter is described and figured by Dr. Charles Ran,' who says : 

Collectors are ready to class chippe<l-stone. articles of certain forms occurring 
throughout the United States as arrow and lance heads, without thinking that 
many of these specimens may have been quite diffei-ently euiployed by the aborigi- 
nes. Thus the Pai Utes of Southern Utah use to this day chipped-tlint blades, 
identical in shajjc with those that are usually called arrow and spear points, as 
knives, fasten iug them in short wooden handles by means of a black substance. 
Quite a nnmber of these hafted Hint knives (fig. 1 ) have been deposited in the col- 
lection of the National Museum by Maj. .1. W. Powell, Avho obtained them during 
his sojourn among the Pai Utes. The writer was informed by Major Powell that 
these people use their stone knives Avitli great effect, especially in cutting leather. 
On the other hand, the stone-tipped arrows still made by various Indian tribes are 
mostly provided with small, slender points, generally less than an inch in length, 
and seldom exceeding an inch and a half, as exemplified by many specimens of modern 
arrows in the Smithsonian collection. If these facts be deemed conclusive, it would 
follow that the real Indian arrowhead was comparatively small, and that the 
larger specimens classed as arrowheads, aud not a few of the so-called spear points, 
were originally set in handles ajjd were used as knives and daggers. In many cases 
it is impossible to determine the real character of small leaf shajied or triangular 
objects of chipi)ed Hint, which may have served as arrowheads or either as scrapers 
or cutting tools, in which the convex or straight base formed the working edge. 
Certain chipped spearhead-shaped specimens with a sharp, straight, or slightly 
convex base may have been cutting implements or chisels. Arrowheads of a slender 
elongated form pass over almost iraj)erceptibly into perforators, insomuch that it is 
often impossible to make a distinction between them. 

Another series of similar implements (Plate 42) with handle attached 
are in the U. S. National Museum. They are from southern California, 
and are reported in Wheeler's Geographical Survey.-^ These specimens 
were collected by Mr. Slmmacher from Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz 
islands. The material, while difli'ering much, was uniformly of liard 
stone, such as flint, chalcedony, or jasper. The blades are inserted in 
redwood handles, fastened with gum or bitumen, and bear the evidence 
of long exi)osure. The dryness of the country whence they came was 
l)robably the cause of their i)reservation. 

These wooden-handled knives were not confined to the coast nor,

indeed, to Calitbruia, but were found tar in the interior. The llaz- 
zard colleetion from the cliff ruins of Arizona and New Mexico, now in 
the Archieological iMuseuni of the University of Pennsylvania, which 
made such a memorable display at the World's Columbian Exposition 
in ( 'hicago, contains a series of similar knives of tiint inserted in wooden 
liandles from 4 to inches in length, of the same style and kind as the 
California specimens in Plate 42. 

Forming part of the same series are eleven other specimens without 
handles, but with the traces of bitumen on the base showing where a 
handle had been attached. It should not be forgotten in considering 
these implements that they come from a country which abounds in the 
ordinary arrowpoints and spearheads of all kinds and sizes, some of 
which show extremely fine chipping. 

There is still another series' (Plate 43) (juite different in form and 
make, but to which the same remark applies. Some of them represent 
the highest order of Hint chipping. They form Class C of the division 
of leaf-shaped implements of the author's classification. They are long, 
thin, and narrow, with a well-wrought base which may be square, con- 
vex, or concave, while the point is sharp and symmetrical. The pecul- 
iarity which determined their classification was the parallelism of their 
edges throughout their length. An inspection of the specimens renders 
it evident that they were never intended as arrowpoints or spearheads. 
Their extreme thinness, together with the breakable character of the 
flint of which they are made, would cause them to break in any shock 
that might be given by throwing, lancing, or shooting. Those of the 
series with convex bases are covered with asphaltnm or bitumen for 1 
or 1.^ inches of the base. This is evidence of their insertion in a handle, 
which, in view of the circumstances, and their association with the former 
specimens, we can only conclude was short, and that the implement was 
intended to be held in the hand and used as a knife or dagger. 

Flint or chert points similar in every way to arrowpoints, and inserted 
in short antler handles, were found by Prof. F. W. Putnam and Dr. 
C. L. Metz, in their excavations of the Mariott mound in the Little 
Miami Valley, Ohio.- Ten or a dozen of these knife handles were 
found, in one of which was inserted a bone instead of a stone blade. 

In the Swiss lake dwellings small polished stone hatchets or chisels 
are frecjuently found inserted in short antler handles. Many of these 
antlers were tenoned for insertion in a heavy wooden handle, evidently 
for use in chopping, as an ax,' but many of the antler handles were 
without tenons, and were evidently intended to be held in the hand 
and used as knives or chisels and not as axes.^ 

Flint or chert arrowpoints, inserted in short wooden handles for use as 
knives, are found in the ancient tombs of Peru. Sharpened and barbed

points of bone and of ivory, inserted in short handles of wood, bone, 
and ivory, the lower end pointed for insertion in a lance shaft for use 
as harpoons, are in coniinon use anion^' the modern Eskimos. This 

short handle can be detached, 
thus making, if need be, a knife 
of the implement. 

An illustration of large blades, 
more or less leaf-shaped, and 
which, if alone, would be taken 
for si)earheads, is shown in fig. 
103, where such an implement of 
nephrite, beautifully wrought and 
finely polished, is inserted in a 
short handle, evidently for use 
as a knife. The illustrations, 
shown in Plate 44, of Eskimo 
specimens from Hotham Inlet, 
Alaska, collected by Lieut. Com- 
mander G. M. Stouey, U. S. N., are 
still more pertinent. Figs. I and 
2 have blades of chert or horn- 
stone of the usual leaf shape. 
Fig. 2 is handled for use as a knife 
by being inserted edgewise in a 
handle of wood. Fig. 1 is inter- 
esting, for its leaf- shaped char- 
acteristics are more easily iden- 
tified, while its handle, instead of 
being of wood or fastened with 
bitumen or asphaltum, as have 
been nearly all others, is made of 
osier wrapped back and forth 
over a part of the upper edge of 
the blade, catching upon the 
irregularities of the fiint edge and drawn tight so as to be held firmly 
In place. This was used as a fish knife, its interstices being yet filled 
with fish scales. J)r. Mason,' describing this instrument, says: 

There are thousands of pieces of shale, slate, quartzit<', ami other stones in the 
National Mnseum, which correspond exactly with the blades of the Eskimo woman's 
knife. These have been fjjathered from village sites, shell heaps, the surface of the 
soil, from graves, mounds, and Indian camps in countless numbers. * » * jn 
the matter of attaching the blade to the handle or grip the Eskimo's mother-wit has 
not deserted her. Manj'^ of the blades are tightly fitted into a socket or groove of 
the handle. Boas, who lived among the Cumberland (Julf Eskimos, tells us that 
glue is made of a mixture of seal's blood, a kind of clay, and dog's hair. (Report 
of the Bureau of Ethnology, VI, p. 526.)

Fi^'. 3 ill this plate represents a liandk' for a similar blade, wbieli is, 
however, missing. It is made of walrus ivory, the groove in which the 
blade has been inserted being plainly seen. 

Fig. 194 represents one of the thin leaf-shaped blades from Wyoming. 
It is of agatized wood, is very thin, and lias been linely chipped. One 
edge is more convex than the other and is much the sharper. Com- 
pared with the Ulu knife (Plate 44, fig. 1), no reason appears why a 
similar handle would not make it the same knife. 

Plate 45 shows a series of common arrow or spear heads w hi<;li have 
been inserted and wired in handles 
by the author. The handles vary 
from G inches in length down. They 
are intended to illustrate the propo- 
sition wliich has been herein pre- 
sented — that with long handles 
they are arrows, with longer han- 
dles they become spears, while with 
short handles they become knives, 
and tlie distinction is only recog- 
nizable by the handle. 

No attempt has been made in the 
foregoing arguments to show a dif- 
ference, except in the handle, of the 
implement used as a spear or arrow 
and its use as a knife. The an- 
nouncement is made as a working 
hyi)othesis that the average stone 
arrowpoint or spearhead collected 
throughout the country as an In- 
dian implementorweapon mayliave 
been either spear, javelin, arrow, or 
knife, dependent upon the kind of 
handle employed. 

There are other imi»lements of the 
same material and manufacture, but 
with variations of form, which are 
not, and were never intended to be, an(»w or spear ]iea<ls. These, when 
viewed in profile from either the side or edge, show that they could not 
have served as piercing implements or weai)ons. Their edges are on the 
sides and not at the points, and tliey could only have been used for cut- 
ting and not for piercing, and were, therefore, knives. Plates 4G and 47 
present specimens of this class. They are here presented in side and 
edge views to show this peculiarity, for viewed from the side only they 
appear as ordinary leaf shaped implements worked all round to an edge. 
The points are not sharp, and it is doubtful if they could ever pierce any 
resisting substance, projected with whatever fince. The impossibility

of their use in this iiiauner becomes more apparent when the edge view 
is considered. This shows the want of symmetry in the imjjlement and 
completely changes the idea presented by the side view. There is on 
the top, if one may so call it, a decided hump, and, for want of a better 
name, these implements have been called " humpbacked." One of them 
is the chalcedonic flint, while the other three are quartzite. They are 
rude and have all been made by chipping. Each implement lias only 
one rounded edge sharp enough for use, and could be used when held 
in the hand after the manner of the fish knife (Plate 44, fig. 1). 

The manner of holding these humpbacked implements for use is 
shown in Plate 48, where two of them are held in the hand so as to pre- 
sent the cutting edge. This (in Plate 48) leads to another hy])othesis, 
that is, that these implements were used ambidextrously, and furnish 
evidence of right- and left-handedness on the part of prehistoric man. 
It is certain that the shaj^e of an occasional implement fits the left hand 
better than it does the right. Certain specimens show this more or 
less plainly. Their humi)S are not in the center but off to one side, 
sometimes to the right, other times to the left, while the experiment of 
grasping them in the hand (as shown in Plate 48) demonstrates that 
they are more easily manipulated and more effective when used right 
and left handed respectively, than when used indifferently. 

It has been suggested that these implements were only accidents or 
failures made by the aboriginal workmen when endeavoring to make 
the usual leaf shaped imjdement, but such is not regarded as a correct 
deduction. 

It would be foolish to assert that there were no accidents or failures 
in the prehistoric i^uarry or workshop. The author has shown in Plate 
03, the chips and debris which he personally took from Flint Ridge, 
Ohio. Anyone having the slightest familiarity with such work has 
seen and will recognize thousands of such specimens. At Piney 
Branch, District of Columbia, they were to be numbered by the hun- 
dreds of thousands and to be measured by the ton. But it is equally 
daring to assert that everything found was an accident or failure, and 
that implements with the specialization of these now under discussion 
were but waste, the debris and rejects of the workshops and the acci- 
dents or failures of the workmen. Their number is too large, their 
dissemination too general, their distribution too extensive, and their 
specialization and adaptability too evident to permit such a conclusion 
to pass unchallenged. The evident existence of an intentional cutting 
edge around one side of the oval can not be ignored, while their fitness 
to either hand, as shown in Plate 48, and their adaptability for use as 
knives or for cutting purposes, are evidences against the reject or waste 
theory that can not be set aside by mere declarations, however persist- 
ently or pertinaciously made. No reason is, or, I take it, can be given 
why the workman, having gotten his implement into its present hump- 
backed condition, should not have continued his work by striking off'

the bump if he desired it to be stricken off, either with a direct stroke 
of the hummer or by the mediatiou of a punch, thus reduciug its thick- 
ness and makiug it the usual leaf-shaped implement. The conclusion 
seems inevitable that his failure to do this is evidence of the want of 
his desire to do so, and that he left it thus — si)ecimens being found 
throughout the country — is evidence that he desired to make a differ- 
ent implement from the leaf-shaped. This different implement was for 
cutting and not for piercing, was to be held in the hand and not used as 
a projectile, and finally is a knife and not an arrowpoint or spearhead. 

Detailed examination confirms the view that these implements were 
intentionally manufactured and were not mere accidents or failures. 
Plate ¥J represents two of these humpbacked implements, side and 
edge views. From these it is evident that the making of the hump 
is intentional. Not only is the hump recognized aud permitted, but 
it has been adopted and treated accordingly. It has not here been 
left rude or unseemly, but has been carefully smoothed by chi])ping 
over its entire surface, the hump being as well preserved as in the 
rudest specimens. The specimens in fhis plate are both of flint, one 
from Wisconsin, the other from Georgia; both are flat on the bottom, 
rounded on top, aud brought by chipping to a sharp cutting edge and 
without point. If these two specimens were the only ones thus treated, 
their evidence would be insufticient, but the Museum possesses numer- 
ous examples of the same kind which tend to prove the same fact. 
Plates 50 to 52 ])resent some of these specimens, and a comparison will 
show the similarity. Their number shows that those in Plate 41) are 
not isolated specimens, while their number and extensive distribution 
throughout the country" demonstrates their common use as one of tlie 
tools or implements belonging to the prehistoric culture of the country. 
These plates are intended also as evidence of the major proposition — 
that is, that many of the flint and other objects heretofore classed as 
arrowpoints or spearheads were really knives. These implements have 
no sharp i)oint8 and couhl never have served for any piercing or thrust- 
ing purpose, but, on the other hand, have been made sharp on one, 
rarely on both edges, and could have been used only for cutting. The 
cutting edge is usually convex; the outer edge or back is thick and 
heavy. It has not been worked, and must be held in the hand to be 
used saw or knife fashion. It is submitted that they show themselves 
to have been cutting implements used after the manner of knives, and 
not to have been either arrowpoints or spearheads. 

The major proposition of this chajiter is that many aboriginal imple- 
ments having the api^earance of arrowpoints or spearheads, and here- 
tofore generally so classed, were not such, but were in reality knives 
intended for cutting or sawing purposes. The specimens on Plate 53 
are evidence in favor of this. The lower or butt end of these speci- 
mens has a stem, with base, notches, shoulders, barbs, sharp edges, 
etc, and in all these regards they resemble the ordinary arrowpoint

or spearhead. The point, liowever, while tsyminetrieally formed and 
thoroughly worked, i« not sharp, but is a well-rounded oval, inijjossible 
for thrusting or piercing. 

On page 941 of the classification of arrowpoints and spearheads, 
among peculiar forms, a certain series is shown as Class II, asymmet- 
ric. These are there mentioned as being possible knives, and were 
inserted to complete the classification, ^o opportunity then ottered 
to investigate their true character or to bring out their peculiarities. 
Plates 54 and 55 and fig. 195 are here introduced in continuation of 
that investigation. The original of fig. 195 belongs to the collection 
of Dr. Eoland Steiner. There are 122 specimens of this series which 
arc represented by fig. 195 and certain si)ecimeus on Plate 55. They 
resemble arrowpoints and spearheads, having the same stem, base, 
shoulders, and barbs. So far as relates to the stem end, their resem- 
blance is i)erfect, and they might belong to any class of stemmed 
arrowpoints or spearheads. Some are rather thick and rude, but many 
are thin and finely chipped. Their peculiarity is 
their asymmetric form. They are lopsided, or one- 
sided. The shoulder or barb is on only one edge. 
The other has been chipped ofi' in the ruder speci- 
mens from one side only, making a concave scraping 
edge, i)0ssibly for arrow shafts, while the finer ones 
are chipi)ed from both sides and are not concave; 
but in both kinds of specimens the shoulder or barb 
is on one side only, and that has been brought to 
Fig. 105. ^^ smooth, sharp edge. An examination of these 

specimens, a number of which are shown in Plates 
Georgia. 54 and 55, shows clearly their asymmetric character

appearance. A short handle attached with smew, 
as in the case of ordinary arrowpoints or spear heads (Plate 45), or 
with gum or bitumen, as in the California specimens (Plates 41-43), 
will make a knife suitable for all known savage needs. 

All differentiation rendering them suitable for knives renders them 
unsuitable for arrowpoints or spearlieads. They are heavier on one 
side than on the other, which renders them lopsided and would throw 
them out of the line of flight and destroy their efficacy as projectiles. 
It is believed that even a slight examination demonstrates the correct- 
ness of the conclusion that they were knives, rather than arrowpoints 
or spearheads. 

Concluding the chapter on knives, it is deemed wise to introduce for 
comparison a series of those which heretofore passed for and have been 
recognized as knives. The author does not remember any specimens 
of the asymmetric or unilateral form in Europe, except those liom 
Solutre which do not belong to the Neolithic i>eriod. Knives were, 
however, by no means rare among the prehistoric implements of that

country. One of those knives is represeuted in Plate ")(), fig. 1. It is 
notbiug more than a sinootli tlake struck from a nucleus of Hint in such 
\vay as to make or leave a natural edge sharp for use. ^^pecimens 
similar to this in appearance and manufacture, and supposed to have 
been made and used as knives, are found in great i)rofusion throughout 
western iMirope, almost every excavation in a i)rehist()ric occupation 
bringing these Hakes to light in greater or less number. The same 
statement can be made in respect to America. Plate 57, figs. 1, 2, are 
specimens of similar Hint tlakes from America, sup[)osed to have been 
used as knives. Flakes of the same general character, but chipped 
to a shaip edge, are found in both Europe and America and are also 
supposed to have been used as knives, ^^'hethe^ they have been dulled 
by use and the edge then restored by clii[)ping is unknown. It is known, 
however, that the woiked tlakes, either primarily or secondarily chipped 
to an edge, have been found in many of these places and that they are 
generally accredited as knives. The other specimens on Plates 5*) and 
57 are representatives of these worked tlakes. 

The subject of knives is not exhausted. It has not even l)een con- 
sidered exce[)t as it involves arrowpoints or spearheads. 

X. WOUNDS BY ARROWPOINTS OR SPEARHEADS. 

J The author of the flannel du Chirurgien d'Armce declared that mili- 
' tary surgery had its origin in the treatment of wounds iutiicted by 
arrows and spears, and in proof thereof he quoted from ancient classics ' 
and cited Chiron and Machaon's ])atieiits, Menelaus and Philoctetes, 
and Eurypyles treated by Patroclus, He believed the name "medicus'' 
' in the Greek anciently' signified " sagitta,'' an arrow,^ and declared that 
I Hii)pocrates used a particular forceps, "beluhium," for extracting arrows, 
t which his successor. Diodes, improved and called '' graphiscos."' ' lieras 
of Cappadocia, in the wars of Augustus, invented the duck-bill forceps. 
Celsus' taught the necessity of dilating the wound in. order to extract 
the arrowhead, and Paulus -.^gineta-' treated arrow wounds in a pecul- 
iarly successful manner. 

The author. Baron Percy, who thus showed his knowledge of classic 
medical literature, supposed he had discovered the origin of surgery 
and was dealing with the earliest wounds made by man with the 
mwchinery of war. 

The discovery in the present century, of prehistoric man, and the 
re])eated findings of his graves and cemeteries belonging to the Neo- 
lithic and Bronze ages, and the thousands of skeletons tlierein, many 
of them witli wounds and fractures — these things have <'omi)letely over-

turned the ideas of Baron Percy as to the eax^liest liumau wounds and 
the orij^iu of surgery. 

lu an earlier chapter we have seen how the ages of stoue and brouze 
had i)ractically passed away without any historical mention of their 
existence. The begiuuing of history is subsequent to them, Nowhere 
in the Eastern Hemisphere, nor elsewhere except among modern sava- 
ges, have stone arrowheads been known in historic times. Arrowpoints 
may have been used by the million in times of antiquity, but those 
known to history, noted by historians, were all of iron or bronze; none 
were of stone. In the army of Xerxes only one tribe, blacks from the 
interior of Africa, had arrows tipped with stone. All others used ii-on 
or bronze. The age of stone arrowpoints or spearheads had i)assed 
away before the time of Xerxes. All of which only shows how sadly 
mistaken was the author of the Manuel du Chirurgien d'Armee in his 
opinion as to the origin of surgery and the dates of the earliest wounds 
made by man's weapons. 

It has been thought by many persons, among them a number highly 1 
qualified to judge, that there were no burials made during the Paleo- 
lithic period in western Europe. Whether tliis be true or not, it must 
be admitted that, either because of the rarity of the burials or the 
immensity of time which has elapsed, or possibly the failure to discover 
the graves, or for these reasons either singly or collectively, there have 
been comparatively few of the skeletal debris of Paleolithic man found, i 
And this would satisfactorily account for the few examples of wounds '■ 
found. The skeletons from the cave at Cro-Magnon show evidence 
of wounds. The femur of the man has been broken, while the forehead 
of the woman that lay beside him bears a large gash, made apparently 
with a flint hatchet. 

Broca, who examined these specimens, is of the opinion that the latter 
bore traces of suppuration and evidences of healing.' 

Dr. Haray reports many of the bones in the cavern at Sordes as hav- 1 
ing curious wounds, one a gaping wound in the right parietal of a 
woman who, like that of Oro Magnon, must have survived the injury 
for some time. Pieces of bone had been removed and there was evi- 
dence of healing.^ 

There has been some question as to whether these caves belonged to 
the Paleolithic period. It makes but little difference to the present 
argument, for we will soon see that in the Neolithic period such wounds, 
made sometimes by hatchets or by blows of other weapons, and some- 
times by thrusts received by arrows or spears, were found in consider- 
able number. 

Dr. Prunieres, of Marvajols (Lozere), France, a surgeon, anatomist, 
and an early student of prehistoric anthropology, conducted many 
original excavations into the dolmens, tumuli, and burial i)laces of his

neighborhood, and had the good fortune to make a large collection of 
objects pertaining to prehistoric man in that country. lie took special 
care to search for and preserve all those relating to physical anthro- 
pology, especially those showing skeletal peculiarities. The following 
is a partial list of objects in liis collection relating to arrow wounds: 

The superior portion of ;i tibia, with a deep and suppurated wound, in which is 
still eiiihedded a flint arrowpoiiit. 

Fragment of the iliac bone, in the internal part of which is <nibcdded an ariow- 
point in a wound which showed signs of suppuration. 

Another fragment of iliac bone, in the external part of which was embedded an 
arrowjioint of tlint in a suppurated wound. 

A dorsal vertebra with Hint arrowjioint in a wound in the body of the vertebra — 
no suppuration.

The caverns of Baumes-Chaudes and L'FTomme Mort were the most 
complete charnel housesof Neolithic times, each containing about three 
hundred skeletons capable of identification. It was out of this wealth 
of uuiterial that Dr. Prunicres was able to obtain such nuiubers of 
peculiar specimens. 

The prehistoric anthropologists of France have always realized the 
importance of examining and jireserving the jiathologic or traumatic 
specimens, and so De ^lortillet, Cartailhac, Nadaillac, De Baye, and 
others have reported many specimens bearing evidence of arrow 
wounds.

de Baye has been, after Dr. Prunieres, one of the 
most saccessful seekers lor these specimens. In 
the cavern of Villevenard he found one skull con- 
taining three tranchaut-transversal arrowheads, 
while another was lodged between the dorsal verte- 
bne. Other human vertebra' pierced with flint ar- 
rowpoints were found in the caves of Petit-Morin. 
In one sei)ulchral cavern the Baron found 73 flint 
arrowpoints, and, as in the case of Villevenard, 
tbeir position was such as to lead to the supposi- 
tion that they had been sticking in the flesh of the 
body at tlic time of interment and had fallen down 
as decomposition progressed. A human vertebra 
was found by M. Cartailhac in the covered Avays 
of Castellet, near Aries, Avith a stone arrowpoint 
incrusted therein. The absence of any exostosis 
shows that death quickly followed. The list of 
examples or specimens showing arrow wounds 
might be augmented considerably, but enough in- 
stances have been given to sliow that the use of 
arrows and other weapons was habitual, and no 

reason is known why an investigation, if carried to any considerable 

extent and in any great detail, might not make a large addition to the 

data already obtained.^

the wound and its jienetration one can only conclude it was made by 
an arrow])oint.

heads found inserted in human bones. These specimens were sent to 
the IT. S. Kational Museum by Dr. John E. Younglove, of Bowling 
(xreeu, Kentucky. Fig. 1 represents an implement 3i inches long, 1| 
inches wide, and one-fourth of an inch thick. The stem is broken, which 
shortens it considerably. It had pierced entirely through the human 
pelvic bone in which it was found. Fig. 2 is 4 inches long, Iji inches 
wide, and one-fourth of an inch thick. It is inserted in the head of a 
human femur( ?). Fig. 1 is loose so that it may be taken out of its present 
socket, while fig. 2 is firmly embedded and can not be removed. The 
material of both is the black or brown lusterless pyromachic tiint con ij 
mon to the country in which it was found. The specimens came fro 
a cavern about 4 miles northeast of Bowling Green, and an equal d. 
tance from Old Station. The opening at the surface was about 3 feei 
in diameter and the hole about 40 feet in depth. At its bottom tin 
cave extended horizontally several hundred feet through solid rockl 
There is no way of telling whether these implements were used ai 
arrows or spears; the shafts which would alone determine that havti 
entirely disappeared, or at least no fragments of either wood or sinew 
were reported. If arrows, they must have been used with an enormom 
bow; it is more likely that they were mounted upon a larger and heavie* 
shaft and used as spears or javelins. 

Looking at these heavy projectiles, considering the conditions of thi 
hand to hand tight wherein they were used, and the force with whic 
they were hurled, it is astonishing that at least one of the fighters, : 
the specimens belong to different individuals, not only survived tli 
shock, but the patient recovered with the weapon embedded in ttl 
wound, for its cicatrization is fouud to be complete. .

These exist not only along the line of the Savannah River, but frequently occur 
on the banks of the Oconee, Ocmulgee, the Flint, the Chattahoochee, and other

formed arrow and spearpoints have been collected on both banks of the Savannah

County iu South Carolina. Even now the supply is by no means exhausted. The 
annual jilowings and constantly recurring freshets reveal each season new examples 
of the taste and skill of these ancient workmen. In the enumeration of the imple- 
ments taken from this locality we do not include multitudes partially formed and 
broken, which, with quantities of chips, still mark the spots set apart for the manu- 
facture. Sometimes we encounter a locality, many yards long and several wide, the 
surface of which is covered to the depth of several inches with fragments struck off 
during the process of manufacture, and with cores and wasters abandoned from 
some inherent defect in the material or broken by the workman. Some idea may 
thus be formed of the extent and duration of the labors of theoe primitive workers

Waynesboro, iu Burke County, and from that neighborhood he obtained many 
implements and made many important discoveries. He reports that there are out- 
crops of jasper on Rocky Creek, at the crossing of the Waynesboro road. Other 
quarries were found in the neighborliood; one of white flint at Erin, and one of yel- 
low flint at OUltown, 10 or 12 miles west in Jeflerson County. There were work- 
shops on what he calls the Davis plantation or the Old Evans place, at the crossing 
of Little Buckhead Creek by the Waynesboro road; one of these was 2 miles up the 
stream at Captain Ridgely's. Dr. Steiner exhausted this neighborhood iu his search. 
He found on the Old Evans place, in the valley of the Little Buckhead, within an area 
of 40 acres, no less than 1(5,000 prehistoric implements, most of Avhich were of the 
same material as the neighboring ([uarries and had probably come from them, but 
many of them were of difterent material and had come from diflereut and perhaps 
distant quarries.' 

There is in the U. S. National Museum a collection of arrow and 
spearheads called, after its finder, the McGlashan collection, from Geor 
gia. It comprises about 20,000 specimens. They are of divers forms 
and sizes, are all of cherty flint, and apparently from one quarry. 
They are much weathered and their color ranges from yellow and rose 
to white. Plate 38, figs. 20-23 are photographs of specimens from the 
collection and show the appearance of the material. 

FLORIDA. 

Hernando County. — Arrowpoint factory on the banks of Trouble Creek, 2 miles 
north of the mouth of the Anclote River, and 5 miles south of Kootie River. 

"About 5 miles sonth of the Kootie River, and some 2 miles north of the mouth 
of Anclote River, is a small stream called Trouble Creek. A considerable body of 
blue flint rock occurs here, cropping out along the shores of the creek, with scat- 
tering nodules lying in all directions. This point was evidently used for a long 
time by the aborigines as a factory for arrow and spear heads. Bushels of chips and 
fragments strew the ground, and large quantities have been washed from the banks 
of the creek and cover its bottom. A long search revealed nothing except a few 
arrowpoints and spearheads spoiled in making, and a lot of broken pottery." -

OHIO. 

Licking and Muskingum counties. — Throughout eastern Ohio there are numerous 
deposits of Hint of various descriptions, and in several counties ])laces are to be 
found in which the ''ancient arrow maker" practiced his calling with the material 
so abundantly supplied. - 

Flint quarry on Williams Hill, Licking Connty, 3 miles west of Brownsville. 
Rei)ortcd by Gerard Fowke. 

Chandlersville, Salt Creek, Muskingum County, Ohio, was the scene of the opera- 
tions of the Muskingum Mining Company iu 1820 for mining silver. It was on the 
National road, 10 miles east of Zanesville. A writer, evidently well-known, though 
his name is not given, tells ' of a trip he took through this country, and describes 
the wells and pits sunk here by the company in which ho was a subscriber, part 
owner, and heavy loser. He says, in his report of excavations and drillings, that 
at a depth of 120 feet they struck a bed of gray Hint rock, 6 or 8 feet in thickness. 
He continues the record of his journey : 

" One mile east of Somerset the National road commences crossing at Flint Ridge. 
[Plates 13-15.] Its general course is from northeast to southwest, passing through 
the counties of Coshocton, Licking, Muskingum, Perry, Hocking, and Jackson, and 
probably into Kentucky. In Hocking County it seems to have been deposited in a 
fine siliceous paste of various colors, from pure white to yellow, clouded, and black, 
and is used for whetstones. In Jackson and Muskingum counties it is extensively 
manufactured into bulir millstones. The whole deposit abounds in casts of fossil 
shells beautifully replaced in many cases by pure quartz. Some are studded over 
with drusy crystals, others filled with chalcedony and quite translucent. The 
various families of Product!, Ammonites, Nautili, Encrine, etc., with many unde- 
scribed species, are found here. » * * In many places it abounds in jasper, horn- 
stone, Hint, quartz, chalcedony, etc., of various and intermingled colors" (p. 233). 

Washington County. — A "magazine" of arrowpoints and spearheads at Waterford, 
near the banks of the Muskingum. ^ 

Perry County. — Flint diggings at New Lexington. 

"At New Lexington, Perry Connty, Ohio, on a knoll near the railroad station, are 
many ancient flint diggings. The flint hero constitutes a regular layer or stratum 
in the coal measures and is about 4 feet thick. It is well exposed in the railroad cut 
on the side of the knoll. Geologically speaking, the flint is a local modification of 
the Putnam Hill limestone, a well-defined stratum of wide extent in southeastern 
Ohio. Many of the pits must have been from 6 to 8 feet deep. The flint is fossilif- 
erous, and much of it is not compact enough for arrowheads, and around the old 
excavations are heaps of the rejected material. These excavations are now largely 
refilled with earth and debris. I had no time to reopen any of them in search of the 
tools by which the flint was quarried. I have little doubt that these pits were snnk 
by the mound builders.''"'

INDIANA. 

Crawford ('oitnli/. — ^Ir. H. C. Hovey gives an accouut of a Hint mine and workshop 
in Wyandotte Cave.' He says that tliero arc what had been called ''bear wallows" 
not far from the Tillard Palace. " These are circnlar depressions, twenty or more in 
number, each a yard wide and a foot deep, and their appearance agrees well with 
their name. About two years ago, however, I had the satisfaction of proving them 
to be the remains of ancient dint works. Happening to remove the clay crust from 
a bear wallow, I found a pile of ashes and cinders on one side. and a ([uantity of dint 
chijis on the other. On examination this proved true of each wallow. Further 
removal of the crust brought to light hundreds of flinty prisms with parallel faces 
and averaging 4 inches in length by 1^ in width and half an inch in thickness. 

"The mine is near by, abounding in flint nodules lying in rows in the cave walls, 
and occasionally in bands or belts. Each nodule has a coating of some grayish 
mineral, perhaps discolored flint, and between them is usually a soft, chalky sub- 
stance, easily cut by a knife. Freshly fractured, a bright black surface appears, in 
contrast with the dingy, faded blocks by the wallows. This change of hue is due 
to the gradual removal of the traces of iron found with the silex. Many of the 
blocks were rejected on account of flaws or imperfections. The nodules are easily 
split into this form, Avhich is convenient fur transportation. Arrow making, how- 
ever, was carried on here to a consideralde extent, as appears from the chips. 
Pounders like those in the alaljaster quarries were foiind along with the flints, show- 
ing the means of breaking the nodules. 

"The only manufactured article dug up in this spot was a little stone saucer con- 
taining a soft, black substance. This may have been a rude lamp. 

"Search at the mouth of the cave unearthed quantities of flint chips, and also 
linished arrowheads. The (luestion has been raised why the Indians should delve 
for flint balls amid subterranean darkness when quantities of such spheres are found 
along the beds of streams and elsewhere in the open air. The reason is that the 
latter, having been exposed to the elements, have deteriorated in quality; they also 
break with irregular cleavage. Hence the Indians sought to get flints fresh from 
the strata where they were originally deposited, and which, because of their mois- 
ture, readily part into triangular prisms under the hammer. 

"Since finding the existence of this flint mine in Wyandotte Cave, I have learned 
of the flint pits dug along Indian Creek and elsewhere in Harrison County, Indiana."

Exteusive flint quarry near the town of Mill Creek. This ((uarry is of the white 
chert peculiar to Illinois, and furnished the huge oval chipped iuiplements supposed 
to have been used as digging tools or for agricultural purposes. The (|uarry was 
discovered in May, 1899, by Dr. AV. A. Thillips and Edward E. Wyman, and opened 
by Drs. I'hillips and Dorsey, of the Eieltl Columbian Museum. '

"About two years ago I discovered on the farm of .1. L. Stockton, 1 mile northwest 
of this city, remains of an aboriginal workshop or village. It is located on a small 
stream called Jersey Creek, and near a large spring. It covers an area of about 
2 acres. The soil is saudy, and to the depth of 2 feet is a complete mixture of flakes 
of flint, ashes, bones — both animal aud human — fragments of ornamented pottery, 
broken and unfinished stone implements of nearly every description. * * * There 
are no deposits of flint or other stone valuable for arrow making, etc., in this vicinity. 
The axes, celts, skin dressers, and balls are all made of porphyry, and the arrow- 
heads of flint." -

ARROWPOINTS, SPEARHEADS, AND KNIVES. 9fi7 

gatioii by INIr. Fi;uik Rutley on "The oiij^iu of cevtaiu novaculites and 
quartzites." 

Clark County. — Aboiiginal workshop in section 17, townsliip ."> south, range 2:5 west, 
from which arrowpoints and cutting iniplemonts, the latter hatchet-shaped and made 
of a species of iron ore, have been taken. 

"On section 9, township 3 south, range 24 west, is an outcrop of novacnlite or 
Hint of tough (|Uality and of various colors. From this material large quantities of 
iirrowheads, etc., have been made. The ancient artisans went down on the south 
side of the outcrop, which is a ledge 700 or 800 feet above the adjacent valley, and 
carried away immense quantities. The material i.s the same as that of arrowheads 
from Tennessee, Mississippi, and westward. 

"There is on C'apt. R. S. Burk's farm, section 17, township .5 south, range 23 west, 
evidence of an extensive workshop in arrowpoiuts and cutting implements. The 
arrow material was taken from theiiuarry above described, although 10 miles away. 
The cutting instruments w^ere of the hatchet kind and made from a sjiecies of iron ore. 
There is another workshop near my home, section 7, township 4 south, range 24 west, 
Montgomery County, Arkansas."' 

WISCONSIN. 

Kenosha Counly. — Lapham - says : "At the city of Kenosha we found, on the ancient 
sandy beach upon which the city is partly built, abundant evidence of a former manu- 
factory of arrowpoints and other articles of tlint. Several entire specimens were 
collected in a little search, besides numerous fragments that appear to have been 
spoiled in chipping them into form. * * * Many different kinds of flint, or chert, 
were wrought at the place, as shown by the fragments. It is probable that the peb- 
les and bowlders along the Lake shore furnished the material. * * * These pebbles 
are the corniferous rock of Eaton and here constitute a portion of the drift, being 
a.ssociated with the tough blue clay that underlies the sand and is the basis of the 
country around. The clay is carried away by the dashing waves, leaving a beach 
of clean pebbles. Numerous fragments of pottery of the usual form and composition 
were also found in the same saudy places." 

INDIAN TERRITORY. 

An extensive novacnlite quarry was discovered and reported to the U. S. Geolog- 
ical Survey by Mr. Walter P. Jenney, which he says was known as the "Old Spanish 
mines." This report, made in 1891, resulted in the visit of Dr. W. H. Holmes 
to the locality for the purpose of investigation and study. " The quarry is situated 
on the Peoria Reservation, about 7 miles northwest of Seneca, ^[issouri, and some 
10 miles southeast of Bdxter Springs, Kansas. From Seneca the spot is reached 
by driving northward along the Missouri border for 5 miles and then crossing the 
line and proceeding 2 miles in a westerly course through the forest. The country is 
a gently rolling plateau, with a gradual descent westward into the valley of Spring 
River, a branch of the Neosho or Orand River, which falls into the Arkansas at Fort 
Gibson, Indian Territory." 

Dr. Holmes's investigations were published in a bulletin of the Bureau of I'th- 
uology, entitled "An ancient quarry in Indian Territory," 1894. Dr. George A. 
Dorsey visited this quarry in 1899.'

tigated. The work was various, sniKilicial, and of jjjroal extent. Quarries, shal- 
low, 2 and .3 feot deep, others 1.5 to 20 feet deep; tnnnids and shafts not very deeii. 
Spearpoints, serapers, axes, and anvils were found ; qiiarry tools, hammers, and maiiis 
were made of bowlders of granite and quartzite, "brought from the neighboring 
mountains, some 20 miles away." The quarry ground was strewn Avith chijis and 
fragments of (juartzite, but not in heaps as where implements have been made. 
"The striking points arc the vast amount of work done, the absence of chip heaps, 
the rude nature of the implements, and their great size. The tonnage of rock moved 
is estimated by hundreds of thousands, if not by millions of tons. *■ * * Imple- 
ments made from (juartzite resembling that quarried are common on the plains and 
in the mountains, * * * 'phe quarrymen must have been aborigines, but unlike 
the Indians of modern times they must have been laborers and to liave worked 
centuries in order to have accomplished so much with the crude tools used. Who 
they Avere will never be known. * * * Central -eastern Wyoming is noted for 
prehistoric quarries, but as a rule they are small and shallow and in no way com- 
parable to the recent discovery. Usually the Indians worked for jasper and agate, 
and dug irregular openings that do not represent the present systematic development. 
Quartzite cjuarries are extremely rare and thesp are by far the largest reported in 
"\^'yoming."' 

Haw Hide ]!an()e. — Dr. A. J. Woodcock reports his A'isit, in company with and under 
the guidance of Mr. W. F. Hamilton, of Douglass, Wyoming, to certain Hint (?) 
mines and aboriginal workshops on the Raw Hide Range, southwest from the Black 
Hills and near Muddy Creek, a bi'auch of the Platte River. About 4 acres had been 
dug over, and rude pits made from 6 to 12 feet dee]), in excavating the desired flinty 
rock, which lay at that distance below the surface. The stone gave a metallic ring 
when struck, and broke with a conchoidal fracture. It had "a wealth of color, the 
basic tints of which were pink, purple, gray, and white, with their intermediate 
shades, * * * in the shape of chipped tools and weapons * * * so scattered 
for hundreds of miles throughout the west, * * * through the Powder River 
country, the Black Hills, the Bad Lauds of South Dakota, the Big Horn Mountains, 
and the great basin of the same name." Mr. Hamilton said he had never seen this 
material in the ledge elsewhere than in this locality. 

The dirt'erent forms ranged from the quarry spall to "a barbed harpoon head of 
chipped and polished stone." They picked up a stone hammer weighing 5 J pounds. 
The disks were plenteous, some of them 20 inches in circumference and 2 inches in 
thickness, chipped to a cutting edge. "A thousand trainloads of chips and s])alls 
were beneath our feet on this one butte alone, and Mr. Hamilton said that several 
others had been worked.'' 

COLORADO. 

Jefferson and Clear Creek counties. — " In a small grove of cottonwood trees near Apex, 
Colorado, the Indians appear to have made, in former times, great quantities of 
tools and arrowheads, for the ground all around is strewn with tools, chippings, and 
arrowpoints, some of the latter made of beautiful stone and of the most exquisite 
workmanshij). Within the space of an acre or two we have found about a hundred 
arrowpoints and ten axes and hammers. The Indians seem to have carried on quite 
a trade among themselves, in order to procure the materials for arrowpoiut-making, 
as some of the chippings found in their encampments are from stones which cannot 
be found within several miles of this place, and some, I think, have been brought 
from distant localities. Although the Indians used several kinds of stone in the 
manufacture of arrowpoints, yet they seem to have had a preference for (|uartzite, 
chalcedony, and jasperized wood, probably on account of their superior hardness, 
and may havenuide others from handsomer but less durable stones only for purposes 
of barter, as the Indians of California exchanged arrowheads made of bottle glass.

APPENDIX B.' 

CACHES. 

Ill cacbing or secreting his imiileinents, prehistoric man followed no 
uniform method of placement, but the deposits are shown to have been 
intentional. The implements were laid in a circle or rectangle and were 
placed flat, on edge, or sometimes on end. Leaf-shaped implements 
have been frequently found en cache, and have been called by some 
"cache implements," but arrowpoints and spearheads, grooved axes, 
polished stone hatchets, large chipped flints, spades, and other imple- 
ments have also been found en cache. It will be seen at once that the 
term "cache implements" can not with propriety be applied to any 
particular one. 

Reports of caches have been made by their discoverers, and these 

have been here brought together and published for the convenience of 

the student.

dark-blue and gray Hint, leaf-shaped. Mr. A'an Epps adds: "Such hoards of arrow- 
points are fre([uent in this vicinity. I know of four instances in a radius of as many 
miles." 

Cache of 120 triangular implements (Dixisiou II), straight base, concave edges, of 
black Hint, from Amsterdam, Montgomery County, found by Mr. Percy Van Epps. 
(Cat. No. 169621, U.S.N.]M.) 

Saratoga County. — Cache of 90 leaf-shaped imi)lement8 (Division I, Class 1?) of 
hornstone, from Saratoga County, New York, found by II. B. McWilliamson (Cat. 
Nos. 170333, 170573, U.S.N.M.), represented by 16 and 62 implements, respectively. 

(Jbwego County. — On the line dividing the towns of Volney and Schroeppel was an 
earthwork on a hill. A long wall, separating the hill from a marsh on the east, still 
remains. Arrowpoints of flint, en caclie, have been plowed up.' 

NEW JERSEY, 

Burlington County. — Cache of 300 triangular arrowpoints (Division II), straight 
base, convex edges, of gray flint. Found on the south bank of Rancoeas Creek, near 
Lumbertou, Burlington County, New Jer.sey, by W; H. Chambers. (Cat. No. 98740, 
U.S.N.M.) Average size, 3f by 1^ by -^\, inches. 

Mercer County. — In IS61 a farmer near Trenton, New Jersey, while plowing, dis- 
covered a cache of stone implements about 15 inches below the surface. Dr. Abbott 
was notified and repaired to the }ilace, secured the collection, and made a full 
description of the deposit. ^ The collection numbered about 150 specimens. They 
were of jasi^er, finely chiiiped, leaf-shaped, with a square base (Division I, Class B), 
and varied in size from 5^ to 7 inches in length, 21 to 3 iuchea in width. Two- 
thirds of the number were arranged in a series of concentric circles, eachi circle 
fitting within the other, and they stood upright on their bases. The other third lay 
flat on their sides and were so placed as to form a wall on the outside. 

Trenton. — Mr. Ernest Yolk excavated an extensive village site in the neighborhood 
of Trenton, between that and Dr. Abbott's house and between the road and the bluff. 
Mr. \'olk cites as evidence against the theory of rejects that ho found in a single 
cache, 2h feet below the surface, where it had evidently been placed for safety, a 
l)ile of 15 pieces of chipped argillite, l)ut one of which couldhave been a completed 
implement. It was somewhat leaf-shaped. All the rest would have passed, accord- 
ing to the theory, for rejects, but were reallj^ selected and secreted, intended, doubt- 
less, to be used at a future time for making implements.

972 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

PENNSYLVANIA. 

Chester County. — Edward T, Ingram, of Marslialltou, discovered a cache of 95 leaf- 
shaped iniitlciuents (Division I, Class 15), square at the base, ai to 7 inches long, 2i 
to ;5 inches wide, and about three-eighths of an inch thick. Thoy are the counter- 
part of ligs. 102 and 103, and also of No. 3 on Plato 29, Class B, the Abbott speci- 
mens heretofore dcscrilted, in this classilication. Mr. Ingram made a division of 
the implements and sent (il of them to the U. S. National Museum, where the 
author has set them up in the form of a cache, as they were found. It is represented 
in section, as though it had been cut in the center jjerpendicnlarly from toj) to bot- 
tom and one-half the earth taken out, leaving the implements projecting as in their 
original location. The cast is of plaster, reproducing the earth. The original 
implements are used to represent the exposed half of the cache, leaving the imagina- 
tion to supply the rest, which are supposed to l)e within the bank of earth and not to 
lie seen. They were laid Hat on their sides, their points to the center, overlapping 
each other where they came in contact. The entire cache is about 15 or 16 inches in 
width — a little more than twice the length of the implements. They were laid in a 
circle, nine or ten of them. This made nine or ten layers and was eijual to a height 
of 11 inches. Tlie top layer was a])Out the depth of a furrow beneath the surface. 
All former plowing had escaped them, but on the present occasion a deeper furrow 
had turned them up, and so they were discovered. Plate 59 represents the plan of 
the cache and shows one layer of the implemcmts. 

Cache of 14 or more leaf-shaped (Division I, Class B) argillite implements, found 
near Brandywine Ci'eek, in Chester County, about 2 miles irom ^^'est Chester, 
Pennsylvania. A. Sharpless. (Cat. No. 62374, U.S.N.M.) 

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 

Cache of 7 stemmed, shouldered, but not barbed (Division III, Class B), imple- 
ments of (juartzite. Found in a bank 2 feet below the surface opposite the navy-yard, 
District of Columbia. (W. llallett Phillips collection, Cat. No. 195926, U.S.N.M.) 

MARYLAND. 

Howard County. — Fifty-two specimens. 

Anne Arundel County. — Five caches containing, respectively, 26, 25, 27, 11, and 4 
specimens. The foregoing caches are reported by Mr. J. D. Mc(iuire, of Ellicott 
City, Maryland, and the implements are in his collection. 

WEST VIRGINIA. 

A cache of 400 leaf-shaped implements (Class B) is reported by Dr. J. F. Snyder, 
of Virginia, Cass County, Illinois, as having been found in West Virginia, locality 
not given.' 

NORTH CAROLINA. 

Caldwell and Alexander County line. — Dr. .1. M. Spainhour, of Lenoir, North Caro- 
lina, found a cache of 597 leaf-shaped arrowpoints near the Caldwell and Alexander 
County line, North Carolina, 16 miles east of Lenoir, in a circular hole in the ground 
9 inches in diameter, 25 inches deep. They occui)ied 13 inches of the excavation, 
which was lilled Avith earth to the surface. These implements vary in length from 
21 to 4 inches, in width from 1^: to l.V inches, and are i to | inch thick. The material 
is porphyritic felsite (called rhyolite when it shows the How structure), used so 
much by the aborigines from Maine to Georgia. (Cat. No. 149662, U.S.N.M.) 

Fifteen leaf-shaped (Division I, Class B) rhyolite implements, found en cache sur- 
rounding a spring, as lepresented in Plate 60, at the head of a rivulet near the foot

no locality nearer than 70 miles from which the material of which they are made can 
be obtained.'" 

SOUTH CAROLINA. 

Aiken Counti/. — Dr. Roland Steiner, of Grovetown, Georgia, reports, April 27, 1895, 
that " I send a cache of rhyolite or schist arrowpoints, 65 in number, triangular and 
rudely stemmed, found iu North Augusta on the South Carolina side of the Savannah 
River, opposite Augusta, Georgia." These were received in due course by the U. S. 
National Museum, and are catalogued as No. 170768. 

GEORGIA. 

Col. Charles C. Jones, jr., makes a somewhat elaborate description of the jjrimi- 
tive manufactures of spear and arrow heads. He (juotes at length from Catlin the 
methods observed by him and reported in his "Last Rambles amongst the Indians." - 

The McGlashan collection (Cat. Nos. 131966-132250, l\S.N.M.) contains 20,000 
specimens of arrowpoints or spearheads, all gathered by a single person from a single 
locality, and largely of one material. They belong to Division III, stemmed, some- 
times shouldered and barbed. These were not reported as en cache, but it is probable 
many of them were. 

FLORIDA. 

Brevard County. — Cache of 12 or 13 pendant ornaments, or "plummets, pendants,

974 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

TENNESSEE. 

Carter Coitnty. — .Tohn W. Emmert, ol" Jhistol, Teunessoo, reported May 4, 1892, 
a cache of leaf-shaped iinpleuients of (luartzite from the bank of the Watauga 
River, Carter County, northwestern Tennessee, consisted of 18 pieces 6| to 9 inches in 
length, 3 to 3i inches in width, and | to | of an inch in thickness. They were buried 
2 feet below the surface, laid on the Hat side, and arranged in a circle with the points 
to the center, the cache being about 2 feet in diameter. The hole in which they 
were deposited was dug through the soil and into the hard yellow clay. Nothing 
was found associated with them, although there was an aboriginal cemetery in 
the neighborhood. (Deposited by T. W., Cat. No. 150195, U. S. N. M.) 

ARKANSAS. 

I Mate ()1 represents 5 specimens out of a cache of 14, found on the banks of the 
Little Missouri River, Arkansas. They were deposited together, the edges over- 
lapping, in a layer of hard yellow clay, on the terrace hillside back from the river 
bank, and were uuassociated with other objects. They are of milk-white chalce- 
d(my, and are from 11 inches in length down. They are classified as Division III, 
Class C, stemmed, shouldered, and barbed. (Deposited by T. W., Cat. No. 150196, 
U.S.N.M.) 

MISSOURI. 

Near St. Louis. — "There are also a few cache finds, notably those large spades from 
12 to 18 inches in length. We have a number of other cache finds, not so large in 
size, but equally fine in wiukmanship. * * * 'j'lj^ spades and hoes come from 
near St. Louis, and are usually found in the vicinity of mounds. They comprise all 
the known forms, and many are polished on one end, which is probably caused by 
digging in the earth.'' (The Missouri Historical Society exhibit of St. Louis at the 
World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, Illinois, under the direction of William J. 
Seever.) 

Chariton County. — "Mr. .John P. Jones, of Keytesville, Chariton County, Missouri, 
communicated to me some particulars of three deposits of flint implements brought 
to light in the neighborhood of his home. The first was a store of spearheads and 
arrowpoiuts, several hundreds in number, which he was too late to secure or satis- 
factorily examine. The weapons were all new, a fact conclusive that here had been 
the arsenal of a tribe or the secreted stock in trade of another primitive American 
merchant." 

Better fortune attended Mr. .Jones in the discovery of a second deposit, consisting 
of 17 new flint knives, as the greater number of them fell into his possession. 

A third deposit described by Mr. Jones was discovered in the valley or "second 
bottom" of Chariton River, and contained about 50 small, flat, ovoid, pointed flints. 
"They had been stuck into the ground, point down, in concentric circles, aud were 
then covered with earth, forming over them a low, flat mound 12 or 18 inches in 
height by 5 or 6 feet in diameter. * * • Some were gapped on the edges, aud all 
were to a certain extent polished."' 

OHIO. 

Hoss County. — Messrs. Squier and Davis,- during their survey of the earthworks 
of Ohio, o])ened a broad but low mound of "Clark's Works," in Ross County, of 
that State. They made an excavation 6 feet long and 4 feet wide, from which 
they took about GOO specimens of flint disks, en cache, placed in two layers edge- 
wise. The deposit extended beyond the limits of their excavation on every side, 
and hence the actual number of specimens was not ascertained by them. The imple- 
ments are described as ovoid or roundish, or terminating in a blunt point at one

end. They were of various sizes, but on au average 6 inches long, 4 inches wide, 
and an inch thick in the center (Plate 62, tig. 1). Some -were rudely blockod out; in 
others the circnniferenco was chipped to a more or less defined edge. The material 
is flint or hornstouo of fine texture, generally of a gray color, and showing some- 
times concentric Lands, in the center of which is a nucleus of blue chalcedony, 
thus demonstrating that the flint was formed in nodules and not in strata or layers. 

In October, 1801, Prof. Warren K. Jloorehead, while working for the Department 
(M) of Ethnology, World's Columbian Exposition, Cliicago, continued tiie sus- 
pended excavations of Scinier and Davis, and opened what he has described as 
Mound No. 2, on Hopewell farm, Anderson Township, Ross County, near Chilli- 
cothe. In three days' work Professor Moorehead took out 7382 of these Hint disks. 
Others found in the immediate neighborhood increased tliis number to 818.").' 
Plate 63 is from a photograph of the tent, and in front of it are the flint disks as 
they were piled after being taken from the mound. 

Summit Coiinii/. — A cache of 197 leaf-shaped implements was found under the 
stump of a tamarack tree 3 miles west of Akron. Mr. Thomas Rhodes sent 5 
of them to the U. S. National Museum, December, 1878 (Cat. Nos. 34584-31588, 
U.S.N.M.). They were from 5 to 7 inches long, 2^ to 3 inches wide, and ^to f inch 
thick. Cat. No. 34584, No. 2, Plate 29, Class B, with rounded base, represents one 
of these specimens. Their fini^ chipping and exceeding thinness are to be remarked. 

Buchtel College, Akron, exhibited at the Cincinnati Exposition of 1887 a, cache of 
leaf-shaped implements similar in appearance to those found by Mr. Rhodes, wliether 
l)art of the same is not known. 

Scioto County. — Mr. Thomas Kinney, of Portsmouth, had 125 leaf-shaped imple- 
ments belonging to a cache discovered in his neighborhood, which he exhibited at 
the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. - 

Lake County. — Colonel Whittlesey reported a cache of leaf-shaped implements 
found by Mr. .J. C. Huntingdon near Painesville.^ 

Jshlaud County, Sullivan roiniship. — In 1872 Mr. S. W. Briggs discovered, while 
plowing, a cache of 201 implements about 18 inches beneath the surface. They 
were leaf-shaped, about 4 inches long, 2 to 2f inches wide and # inch thick. They 
were dei)osited in a keg-like vessel of the bark of the red elm, 10 or 12 inches in 
diameter and 13 inches in height. No signs of use. ' Figs. 105 and 106 are specimens 
from this cache. As will be seen, both are thin, finely chipped, with rounded base 
and of the form of Class B. 

Clarke County. — Cache of flint implements, number not given. ^ 

Holmes County, Washinyton Townsliip. — On the farm of Mr. Daniel Kick, 96 leaf- 
shaped implements of Class B. They were found in the alluvial deposit at the 
bottom of a pond, 3 feet beneath the surface. The U. S. National Museum possesses 
2 of these specimens (Cat. Nos. 28345-46, U.S.N. M.) sent by Mr. H. B. Case. The 
average sizes were 2| to 5i inches long, IJ to 2^ inches wide, and i to | inch thick, 
very thin and finely chipped and of chalcedonic flint of the color of dirty beeswax.'' 

Butler County. — Prof. .1. S. McFetridge, of College Corner, rejjorts August 7, 1895, 
a cache of 7 beautiful white flint arrowi>oint8, mon; chalcedony than flint. They 
were all stemmed and shouldered, but not barbed (Division III, Class B), about 3^

all cousisted of a reddish material, although some were a light gray. I sent by 
mail to-day some samples of them."

cache was 49 pounds. - 

Columbiana County. — Mr. I. L. Kite, in a letter of February 25, 1878, published in the 
Cleveland Herald, describes a find near Damascus. "The deposit would fill a 
bushel basket. They were all jilaced on the broad end, enough set up to fill a cer- 
tain circle, then another on top, and then another until a perfect cone was formed." 

INDIANA. 

Tliirty miles south of Chicago. — Cache of 96 leaf-shaped implements pointed at both 
ends (Division I, Class A), from Si to 4 inches long, of dark grayi8h-l)rown jaspery 
flint, buried under a stump. Discovered and reported August 2, 1895, by Dr. Daniel 
B. Freeman, 4080 Drexel Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois. 

Cache of 82 specimens found near Blue River by Mr. Ira Williams of Borden, 
Indiana. These are similar to the flints found by Dr. Snyder in Illinois and Professor 
Moorehend in Ohio, slightly pointed at both ends, made from similar nodules of black 
flint. The largest is about 6 inches long and 5 inches wide, while the smallest is 
about 3 inches long and 2 inches wide.

Schuyler County. — A few years ago, at Bluff" City, Illinois, some hogs confined in a 
pen at the foot of the bluff's rooted out of the ground a deposit of 16 polished-stone 
axes, all of which bore marks of use. They were of hard, compact diorite, and 
varied in size from 6 to 16 inches in length, and from 2 to 7 incites in width. Con- 
sidering the probable nses to which these tools had been applied, and the location 
of the deposit, in a spur of the bluff near tbe (Illinois) river, it was plain that here, 
ill ages past, a canoe had been constructed. The work completed, the tools were 
cached at the foot of the bluff", until they should again be needed for similar work.''

ARROWPOINTS, SPEARHEADS, AND KNIVES. 1)77 

In the yciir 18fi0 a similar deposit of hornstoiie was discovert-d in this vicinity, in 
the town of Frederickville, Schuyler County, on the west side of the Illinois Kiver. 
This locality was a favorite abiding place of the Iiulians and the center of a dense 
l>opulation. Relics of their work are still found in abundance throughout this 
region. A small ravine near the foot of a blurt", one day after a heavy rain, caved 
in on one side, and the displacement of a large quantity of earth in conse(|uence 
exposed to view a few strange-looking tlints. They had been l>urie<l about 5 feet 
below the surface of the hillside, laid together on edge, side by side in long rows, 
forming a single layer of unknown extent. The discovery of such novel objects 
attracted some of the villagers to the place, who dug out a1)0ut 3,500 of the nui(|Uo 
implements, and, their cnriosity satisfied, abandoned the work withoiit reaching the 
limits of the deposit. » * » Xhe stone of which these disks are made is a dark, 
glossy hornstone, uudistingnishable from the disks of the sacrilicial mound in 
Ohio.' 

Carroll Counti/. — In the town of York, on section 7, is iv deposit of flint chippings. 
On the top of a high sand ridge, for a space of a mile long and half a mile wide, llint 
chippings are exposed. In some jilaces they occur in masses of a peck or half a 
bushel; in other places they whiten the ground for yards. The material is a cream- 
colored chert, breaking with a smooth conchoidal fracture. It was all brought there, 
as no stone is found in situ in the whole ridge. Here was a great manufactory of 
arrowpoints and other Hint implements. Pieces of arrowpoints and fragments of the 
tlint in all stages of manufacture strew the ground. Perfect arrowpoints are some- 
times found in clusters. Twenty-six were recently picked up in one nest — rough, 
but well-nigh finished. - 

Cass Conntij. — "In the spring of 1880, Mr. George W. Davis, farmer in Monroe pre- 
cinct, Cass County, Illinois, 10 miles east of the Illinois River, while plowing, 
observed a few sharp-pointed tlints, and found that they formed part of a deposit 
of 32 small implements which had been carefully placed in the ground on edge, 
side by side, with their points toward the north. They seem to have been buried. 
With one exception they are of a cherty, muddy-looking siliceous stone, of a 
grayish color streaked with white; a flinty formation occurring in all lead-bearing 
strata of Illinois, and identical with the cherty nodules and seams in the subcarbon- 
iferons outcrops of the upper Mississippi and southwestern Missouri. They had been 
buried new, showing no marks of use, and their jiecnliar style of workmanshi]) and 
similarity of design leave little doubt that they are the j^roduct of the same artisan. 
The exceiitional one in the dejiosit is a well-proportioned and perfect spearhead 
nearly 3 inches in length, neatly chipped, of opaque milk-white flint, strongly con- 
trasting in material, shape, and tinish with the others, and evidently manufnctured 
by some other hand, perhaps in a difl'erent and remote workshop. Fourteen of the 
lot are laurel-leaf or lanceolate ]»attern, pointed at one end and rounded at th(> other, 
with edges equally curved from base to point, averaging three-eighths of an inch in 
thickness in the middle and evenly chipped to a cutting edge all around. They are 
nniforni in shape, but difler in size; the smallest measuring 2J inches in length by 
1^ inches in width at the centcjr; and the largest one H inches long and nearly 2 
inches wide. They are of a type common in all parts of the Mississippi Valley, and 
are supposed to have l)een used as knives or ordinary cutting tools. The remaining 
18 are shaped alike, difler in size, but are of the same average thickness. They, 
too, are sharp-pointed at one end, but in outline from base to point their sides are 
unequally convex, one being slightly curved and the other curved but little from a 
straight line, giving them an iinga.inly and lopsidetl form. Their broad ends, origi- 
nally rounded, probably like the first 14, have been chipped away on each side for a 
half or three-fourths of an inch from the extremity, forming a broad, rudimentary 
shank. (See Chap. IX, p. 948:)

978 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

A <lr-i»(»sit o[" Hints Avas turned up hy tlu^ plow, ou March I'S, 1882, on tlu; southern 
boriha- of Cass Uouuty, 26 milrs east of the Illinois River. Its location was ou the 
brow of the hills overlooking Indian Creek to the south. In this caclie were 35 
elegant Hint implements entirely diH'erent in form, material, and linish, from those 
before described. Their iiositiou in the ground was A^ertical and closely packed 
together, but otherwise without any peculiar arrangeuu'ut. The 35 beautiful flints 
of this Indian Creek deposit are the perfection of ancient stone-chipping art. In 
form they are of the broad or lilac-leaf pattern, jioiuted more or less obtusely at one 
end and regularly semicircular at the other; the length but little exceeding the 
width ; scarcely more than three-eighths of an incli thick, they are smoothly chipped 
to an even, sharp edge all around. They vary a little in size and somewhat in pro- 
portions ; the smallest of them is 3^ inches long by 2f inches broad at the base, and 
the largest one measures 5 inches in length and 3J inches across the widest iiart. Six 
of them are made of mottled red and l)rowu glossy jasper, and the remaining 29 of 
oriliuary white flint shading in texture from the compact translucent glassy to the 
opaciue milk-white varieties. The rounded edge of eacli is smooth and worn, and 
the sides of some are gapped, testifying to long and hard usages l)efore their inter- 
ment, and indicating conclusively that the broad circular edge of the tool was the 
one chiefly used.' 

In the summer of 1872 I received intelligence that a deposit of the same sort of 
flints had been found at Beardstowu (Cass County). In excavating a cellar for a 
new building on Main street, the laborers had reached the depth of 4 feet when 
they struck the flints, and soou threw them all out (about a thousand in number), a 
large portion of which I secured. The disposition of the flints in this deposit was 
different from that in the Ohio mound, and that of the Frederickville deposit also. 
These were embedded in the bank of the river, above the reach of highest water, 
and about 300 yards up the bank of the stream from the large mound. An excava- 
tion about 5 feet deep had been made through the sand to the drift clay, and, 
instead of being placed on edge, as in the two other deposits, a layer of the disks 
had been placed flat ou the clay, with points upstream, and overlajiping each other 
as shingles are arranged on a roof. Over the first layer of flints was a stratum of 
clay 2 inches in thickness; then another layer of flints was arranged as the first, 
over which was spread another 2-inch stratum of clay, and so on, until the deposit 
comi»rised five series or layers of flints, when the whole Avas covered Avith sand. 
The area occupied by these buried flints measured in length about 6 feet, and in 
width 1 feet. * * * j^q traces of fire Avere visible, nor had there been Avithin the 
recollection of the oldest settler of the i)lace anj' mound or other external object to 
mark the place of deposit. The flints of this lot are identical in material, color, 
stylo of execution, and general outline and dimensions with those I have seen from 
deposits at Frederickville and Clark's Works in Ohio. A fcAv of them are almost 
circular in shape. Some are rough, but the majority are very accurately propor- 
tione<l and neatlj' finished, Avhich Ave may accept as proof that the implements were 
manufactured by seA^eral artisans who possessed unequal degrees of skill. Their 
average length is 6 inches, their Avidth 4 inches, and they are three-fourths of an 
inch thick in the middle. Their average Aveight is 11 pounds. * * * They were 
all made from globular or oA'al nodules of black or dark-gray hornstone, Avliich 
Avere iirst split open and each part again split or Avorked down by chipping to the 
shape and size required. In seAcral of the specimens the first fracture of the nodule 
forms the side of the Implement, Avith but slight modification beyond a little trim- 
ming of the edges. Many of them retain in the center the nucleus around Avhich 
the siliceous atoms agglomerated to form the nodule. In a few the nucleus is a 
rough i)iece of limestone; in others it consists of fragments of beautifully crystal- 
lized chalcedony, surrounded by regular light and dark circles of eccentric accretion

[see Plate 62], and the exterior of the rock was iiu-rusted with a coinjiact, drab- 
colored calcareo-.siliceons coatiug of half an inch iu thickness, which in some of 
the specimens has not V)eeu entirely removed. Nearly all tin- Beardstowu disks 
were roughened and discolored with patches of calcareous concretion almost as 
hard and solid as the llint it^jself, indicative of undisturbed repose in their clay

Peoria County, Millhrook Townskip. — Cache, number unknown.^ 

St. Clair County. — "The finest Indian mound in the State of Illinois is situated 3 
miles northeast of the town of Lebanon, in St. Clair County, not far from the west 
ern Ixirdcr of Looking-glass Prairie. In shape it is a truncated pyramid, or rathei a 
l)aralleli)gram, measuring at its l)ase 400 feet in length and 2o0 feet in width, and 
rising in perfect x>roporti(ms tothe height of 50 feet. The angles are still sharp and 
well delined and the top level, comprising (approximately) an area of 80 by 150 feet, 
which doubtless served as the base of some elaborate wooden structure. In the 
summer of 1843 the proprietor of the land, Mr. Baldwin, in sinking a well near one 
coiner of the mound, found, a few feet below the surface, packed closely together, 
18 large Hint spades. These implements Avere broad, flat pieces of white or grayish 
white llint, measuring, the smallest 9 inches in length by 5 inches in width, the 
largest 15 by 7 inches. Thej' are nearly an inch in thickness in the middle, neatly 
chipped to an edge all around, flat on one side and slightly convex on the other 
One end of each flint is broader than the other, and the broad end is symmetrically 
rounded, and polisheil as smooth as glass by loug-contmued use in sandy soil. The 
luirrow end is rough and not so neatly flnished, showing no marks of wear, and was, 
in all proV)ability, when the implement was in use, fastened in some sort of 
handle. It can not be doubted that these flints were in part the tools used in mak- 
ing the mound, and when the great work was tinished they were stored away in the 
ground until again needed.'' " 

"In the early part of December, 1868, some laborers, while engaged in grading an 
extension of Sixth street, in East St. Louis, came upon a deposit of Indian relics, 

* ' * flint tools, all of the hoe and shovel type, and " * * close by were 
found several bowlders of flint and greenstone, weighing from 15 to 30 pounds each, 
and many fragments of flint. The deposit was covered with from 18 to 24 inches of 
black earth. * * * The implements formed a "nest" by themselves, and instead 
of being packed close together were arranged with some regularity, overlapping 
each other or standing edgewise and covering a circular space. The whole dejiosit 
did not extend more than 7 or 8 feet on either side. The contractor neglected to 
count the implements, but he thinks there were from 70 to 75 in all — some 50 hoes 
and about 20 shovels. No other stone articles, such as arrow and spear heads, toma- 
hawks, etc., had been deposited with the agricultural implements.' " 

"In the summer of 1869 some children amusing themselves near the barn on the 
farm of Mr. Oliver II. Mullen, in the ueighl)orhood of Fayetteville, St. Clair County, 
dug into the ground and discovered a deposit of 52 disk-shaped flint implements, 
which lay closely heaped together.'"

980 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

MICHIGAN. 

Saffinatc Jaileij. — Nine caches of arrow aud spearheads were reported by Mr. Har- 
lan I. Sniitb, of .Saginaw East Side, before Section H of ihe American As.sociatiou.' 
They were all chipped blades of chert, believed to luu'e been made from nodules of 
the 8nbcarl>oniferou8 period, which outcrops in a circular line in Saginaw Bay near 
Bayport. They are as follows: 

No. 3. Frazier cache No. 1, 300 pieces. (1) Large black leaf-shaped implements 8 
inches long with delicate stem at tip of base (turkey tail); (2) similar implements 
about 3 inches long; (3) small, yellow chert, leaf-shaped; (4) a few of the same, 
notched. Six miles from Saginaw, on the Tittabawasfsee River. 

No. 4. Frazier cache No. 2, one large black leaf-shaped imi)lemeut similar to tho.se 
in cache No. 1, surrounded by 13 rubbed stones. A few feet from Frazier cache No. 
1, about 1 foot deep. 

No. a. Merrill cache, 100 pieces, 1 foot depth. 

No. 6. Cass cache No. 1, 70 pieces; leaf-shaped, 2 inches long, of dark-ltlue color, 
and different from the chert found in the other caches. Eight inches in depth, soutli 
bank of Cass River aud 3 miles above Bridgeport. 

Cass cache No. 2, 22 pieces and 12 nodules, with abundance of chips and flakes. 
South side of Cass River, 4 miles below Saginaw. 

No. 8. Willie cache; 175 chipped blades, triangular, H inches long. North bank 
of Cass River, 3 miles above Saginaw. 

No. 9. Bayport cache ; 47 pieces, rude leaf-shaped, laid in a roll overlapping each 
other, reminding one of shingles on a roof. Two feet depth. 

By letter of August 10, 1894, Mr. Smith reports the extension of his discoveries to 
include 14 caches. 

South Safjinaw. — Mr. E. S. Golson, in letters of February 16 and May 9, 1892, 
describes two caches he found at or near his home at Green Point. One was found 
April 26, 1890, and consisted of 83 rude and thick leaf-shaped implements of " Bay- 
port'' stone on the " west bank of the Tittahawassee River at its mouth, about one- 
half mile from the mounds at Green Point." They were buried about 4^^ feet under 
the surface and were placed together in a hole a foot or more in depth and width. 
These were sent by him to Peabody Museum. He found his second cache on the 
day he wrote his last letter. The specimens, .58 in number, were smaller than those 
in the former. They were of three sizes; all were leaf-shaped except one stemmed. 
None were deeper than 18 inches, and they had probably been disturbed by the plow, 
as they were not arranged with any system, but were scattered over a space of 6 feet 
square. They were all of the same size. 

WISCONSIN. 

llacine Coiinti/. — " Some workmen, in digging a ditch through a peat swamp near 
Racine, found a deposit of disks of hornstone, about 30 in number. They lay on 
the clay at the bottom of the peat about 2| feet below the surface. Some of the 
disks were quite regular; they vary from half a pound to a pound in weight." - 

Dane County. — Cache of 300 leaf-shaped (Division I, Class A) implements of por- 
phyritic felsite, found in Madison, Dane County, Wisconsin, by Mr. A. R. Crittenden. 
(Cat. No. 342.55, U.S.N.M.) 

Kewanee district trail. — Cache of 42 copper implements. Twenty-five of these 
were found at one time and described by the x)erson who discovered them (a squaw) 
iis a large green stone which she kicked and it fell apart, and upon picking it up 
she found about 25 ditterent specimens. In going over the ground at the same spot

a yoar or two later 17 more implements were foiiu<l, ami near at hand were a group 
of polished-stone hatchets, one very largo maul with center grooved, and a half 
dozen Hint arrowpoints, the whole having been looked upon since as a cache, and are 
considered by the present owner, Mr. Wyman, as a kit of ancient mining tools left 
on the trail from the Kewaueo district. Silver is plainly discernible in many of the 
objects of the native copper. 

Calumet County — A cache of 22 leaf-shaped flint implements averaging from 2 to 
25 inches in width and t inches in length and standing on edge was found under a 
stump in Calumet County. A cache of 5 leaf-shaped implements was found near 
Kachena. Another caclio of 7 arrowpoints from near New Holsteiu. Nearly all of 
the arrowpoints and spearheads are of (j^uartzite, varying from the light-colored 
material to that of a dark maple-sugar color, and in size from 1^ to 9A inches. Mr. 
Hayssen has found a ledge of this (juartzite near Black River Falls, where a large 
workshop is plainly indicated. (Hayssen Collection, NewHolstein, Wisconsin.) 

MINNESOTA. 

Mower County — Mr. Thomas B. Smith, of Rose Creek, October X, 1895, reports that 
he has found in a cache on his farm 4lS arrowjjoints. 

OREGON. 

Rev. M. Eells, a veteran archieologist of Oregon,' speaking of stone spearheads 
and arrowpoints in that country, says "they wer6 scarce, never having been made 
in modern times, but belonging only to ancient times. At Oregon City, about half 
a mile below the falls, is a perfect mine of them which had been unearthed by high 
water. A workshoi) was at the Umatilla landing, where Mrs. Kunzie h:is obtained 
many, some as beautiful as can bo made. The chips are now seen all around, though 
the stone of which they were made — much the same as that used at Oregon City — 
must have been brought long distances."

APPENDIX 0.1 

LARGE IMPLEMENTS OF ARROWPOINT OR SPEARHEAD FORM. 

There are certain implements found throughout the United States, 
more especially the western and southwestern, which, except for 
their immense size, are identical in form with certain spear and arrow 
heads. An implement 2 or 3 inches in length will be recognized as an 
arrowpoint; if 5 or 6 inches in length it might be a javelin, lance, or 
spear; but when we encounter one, however correct it may be as to 
form, or fine as to workmanship, which is 10 inches or a foot in length, 
then what shall we call it and how shall we define its use? The U. S. 
National Museum possesses many of these specimens. Some of them 
have been found in cache, some in mounds and burial places, others 
sporadically, on the surface. Their great size and weight, while it does 
not absolutely interdict their attachment to a shaft or handle, nor their 
use as a weapon, render both extremely unlikely, or they might have 
been used ceremonially. But we are absolutely without other knowl- 
edge as to their use or purposes than that furnished by the implements 
themselves and their associations. 

George F. Arvedson, of Carpentersville, Illinois, reported the finding of an imple- 
ment of white flint or chalcedony of the form of a spearhead, stemmed and shouldered, 
not bai-bed (Division III, Class B) 15 inches long, 2| inches wide and § inch thick. 

C. D. Williams, of Gainesville, Florida, reports having found in southwestern 
Georgia an implement of spearhead form (Division III, Class C) stemmed, shouldered, 
and l)arbed, of gray flint, 14^ by U inches by 1 inch. 

Messrs. M. H. Spillmanand E. B. Sumner, of Fainesville, Lake County, Ohio, report 
the discovery, while digging in a mound near that town, of an implement of white 
flint or chalcedony, shouldered, stemmed, and barbed (Division III, Class C) ]2J 
inches long, 3.V inches wide, and f inch thick.

Reference is made to the 95 implements in the cache reported by Mr. Edward 
Ingram from Chester County, I'eunsylvania, and tigured in Plate 59; also to sundry 
large specimens described and figured in other parts of this paper. 

Dr. Abbott,' speaking of these large spearheads and referring to 
Schoolcraft, makes mention of an Indian chief presenting to him one 7 
inches long and declaring it to be an implement belonging to his ances- 
stors, and says : 

It is not a little strange that the early writers, who refer to the Indians before 
they had wholly discarded stone implements, or very soon alterwards, s'hould so 
generally have overlooked this form, while they frequently mention their axes and 
arrowpomts. Neither Holm nor Kaliu refer to tln^ large spearheads as weapons of 
the Delaware Indians, or refer to the use of the spear or lance, in describing their 
methods of warfare; yet the number of these objects found is of itself sufficient to 
indicate that at one time they w^ere in very common use. Is it probable that they 
had been discarded in great measure at some remote period"and were veritable relics 
of a distant past when the European settlers first reached our shores? The absence 
of direct reference to these characteristic implements seems indicative of this. 

This raises an exceedingly interesting qnestion. Whatever may have 
been the purpose, and when or by whomsoever made, may they not 
have been themselves prehistoric to the aborigines at the time of the 
discovery of the continent? Are they to be classed with the so-called 
ceremonial objects, banner-stones, l)ird and boat shaped articles, and 
with tubes, plummets, sinkers, or charms, not only the uses or purposes

ofAvliieb are uiikuown to our modern Iudiaii,but even the races or peo- 
ples by whom they Avere made; all of which gives rise to numberless 
speculations? 

There are certain other large stone implements of leaf-shaped ibrm 
resembling Class B, and from description and drawing might be assigned 
to it. These are the so called hoes or agricultural implements. Their 
locality is extensive, but nevertheless, is limited to the interior, say 
from Ohio to Georgia, and from the Virginia mountains to the western 
Mississippi Valley. The im])lemeuts are large, being from 6 to IG inches 
in length, with corresponding width and thickness. They are of 
quartzite, novaculite, chert, and similar material, and are always 
chipped. Although resembling in form the ordinary leaf-shaped imjde- 
ment, they have no other or further relation to it. While they are more 
or less jjoiuted at both ends, yet they are not sufficiently so for thrust- 
ing or piercing, and were evidently never intended for such purposes. 
They may have been inserted in a handle, though no traces of it have 
ever been found, or they may have been held in the hands. An inspec- 
tion shows them to have been used as an implement for digging in the 
earth. The point is frequently worn smooth and dull for several inches 
jip the blade, showing stria; and even notches, the result of friction in 
the earth by digging. 

These implements are sometimes found en cache. The collection of 
the Missouri Historical Society displayed at the World's Fair held in 
Chicago, in 1893, under the direction of Mr. William J. Seever, contained 
many of these implements, chiefly from the neighborhood of St. Louis, 
some of which were from caches. See Appendix A (quarries), Illinois, 
p. 966, and Appendix B (caches), p. 974. 



APPENDIX n.i 

MAKING OF ARROWPOINTS DESCRIBED BY EXPLORERS AND 

TRAVELERS. 

Cutliii- thus describes the Apache mode of making flint arrow- 
l)oints: 

Like most of the tribes west of and iu the Rocky Mountains they manufacture 
the lihules of their spears and points for their arrows of tiints, and also of obsidian, 
whi»h is scattered over those volcauic regions west of the mountains; and, like 
other tribes, they guard as a profound secret the mode by which the tiints and 
obsidiau are broken into the shapes they require. * * ^ 

Every tribe has its factory in which these arrowheads are made, and in those 
only certain adepts are able or allowed to make them for the use of the tribe. 
Erratic bowlders of flint are collected (and sometimes brought an immense 
distance) and broken with a sort of sledge hammer made of a roniuled pebble of 
hornstoue set in a twisted withe, holding the stone and forming a handle. * * * 
The nuister workman, seated on the ground, lays one of these flakes on the palm of 
his left hand, holding it firmly down with two or more fingers of the same hand, 
and with his right hand, between the thumb and two forefingers, places his chisel 
(or punch) on the point that is to be broken ofi:'; and a cooperator (a striker) 
sitting in front of him, with a mallet of very hard Avood, strikes the chisel (or 
punch) on the upper end, flaking the flint oft' on the under side, below each pro- 
jecting point that is struck. The flint is then turned and chipped in the same 
manner from the opposite side; and so turned and chipped until the required shape 
and dimensions are obtained, all fractures being made on the palm of the hand. 

In selecting a flake for the arrowhead a nice judgment must be used, or the 
attempt will fail. A flake with two opposite parallel, or nearly parallel, planes is 
found, and of the thickness required for the center of the arrowpoint. The first 
chipping reaches near to the center of these planes, but without quite breaking it 
away, and each chipping is shorter and shorter, until the shape and the edge of the 
arrowpoint are formed. 

The yielding elasticity of the paim of the hand enables the chip to come off 
without breaking the body of the flint, which would be the case if they were 
broken on a hard substance. These i)eople have no metallic instruments to work 
with, and the instrument (punch) which they use I was told was a piece of bone; 
but on examining it I found it to be a substance much harder, made of the tooth 
(incisor) of the sperm whale or sea lion, which are often stranded on the coast of 
the Pacific. This punch is about 6 or 7 inches iu length and 1 inch in diameter, 
with one rounded side and two ])lane sides, therefore presenting one acute and two 
obtuse angles to suit the points to be broken. 

This operation is very curious, both the holder and the striker singing, and the 
strokes of the mallet given exactly in time with the music, and with a sharp and 
rebounding blow, iu which, the Indians tell us, is the great medicine (or mystery) 
of the operation. 

I See p. 884.

986 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1^97. 

To Catlin's description Mr. Stevens' makes the following approving 

criticism : 

What Catlin has said witli regard to a rebounding blow is perfectly true; it is 
impossible to flake Hint with a dull, heavy, smashing blow; it is the measured and 
rebounding blow— a shock rather than a blow— which, given witli Judgment, 
enables the material to take its own line of cleavage, and produces what is so well 
known as the conclioidal fracture, resulting from human skill, that distinguishes 
the mere splinter of Hint from the Hint Hake; and it is the repetition of this opera- 
tion twenty or thirty times around the edges of those flint implements found in the 
di-ift that stamps them as proofs of hnman handiwork. 

Admiral Sir E. Belcher ' gives an account of the manufacture of flint 
arrowpoints by the western Eskimo tribes at and north of Icy Cape, 
as follows: 

But to the process which they pursue in eflccting the line, regular, serrated edges 
of their flint arrowheads. 

Possibly, had I not witnessed the operation and had been at the time one of the 
first Europeans with whom they ever had communication, the idea would have 
remained undisputed that they owed their formation to the stroke of the hammer, 
r.eing a Avorking amateur mechanic myself, and having practiced in a very similar 
manner on glass with a penny piece in 1815, I was not at all surprised at witnessing 
the modus operandi. .Selecting a log of wood iii which a spoon-shaped cavity was 
cut, they placed the splinter to be worked over it, and by pressing gently along the 
margin vertically, first on one side an;l then on the other, as one would set a saw, 
they splintered olf alternate fragments until the object thus properly outlined pre- 
sented the spear or arrowhead form, with two cutting serrated edges. 

But let us revert to this instrument for the use of which the untaught would never 
imagine a purpose, and which, I suspect, was not witnessed or deemed worthy of 
notice by any other individual of the exj)edition. 

First, this instrument has a graceful outline. The handle is of fine fossil ivory. 
That would be too soft to deal with the flint or chert in the manner required. But 
they discovered that the point of the deer horn is harder and also more stubborn; 
therefore, in a slit, like lead in our pencils, they introduced a slip of this sub- 
stance and secured it by a strong thong, put on wet, but which on drying became 
very rigid. Here we can not fail to trace ingenuity, ability, and a view to orna- 
ment. It is the jioint of the deer horn which, refusing to yield, drives olf the fine 
conclioidal splinters from the chert. [See figs. 68-74]. 

I can not here omit remarking that the very same ])rocess is pursued by the Indians 
of Mexican origin in California with the obsidian points for their arrows; and also 
in the North and South Pacific— at Sandwich Islands (21^ north), and Tahiti (18^ 
south) — 39 degrees or 2,340 miles asunder— similar indentations or chippings are 
carried out in forming their axes from basaltic lava, but probably performed in the 
latter instances with stone hammers. I myself Avitnessed at the convent of Monterey 
the captured Indians forming their arrowheads out of obsidian similarly to the 
mode practiced by the Eskimos. 

Schoolcraft ■* thus describes the mode of making Hint arrowpoints by 
the North American Indians: 

The skill displayed in this art, as it is by the tribes of the entire continent, has 
excited admiration. The material employed is generally some form of hornstone,

sometimes passiug into flint. This mineral is often called chert by the English 
mineralogists. No specimens have, however, been observed where the substance 
is gnnflint. This hornstone is less hard than common quartz, and can readily be 
broken by contact with the latter. Experience has taught the Indian that some 
varieties of hornstone are less easily and regularly fractured than others, and that 
the tendency to a conchoidal fracture is to be relied on in the softer varieties. It 
has also shown him that the weathered or surface fragments are harder and less 
manageable than those quarried from the rocks and mountains. 

To break them, he seats himself on the ground, and holds the lump on one <>f his 
thighs, interposing some hard substance below it. When the blow is given, there is 
a sulticient yielding in the piece to be fractured not to endanger its being siiivered 
into fragments. Many are, however, lost. After the lump has been broken trans- 
versely it re(iuires great skill and i)atience to chip the edges. Such is the art required 
in this business, both in selecting and fracturing the stones, that it is found to be 
the employment of particular men, generally old men, who are laid aside from hunt- 
ing, to make arrow and spear heads. 

The iiuHleni inanufacture of obsidian arrowpoints by the Indians of 
California is thus described by an eyewitness: ' 

The Indian seated himself on the floor and. laying the stone anvil upon his knee, 
with one blow of his agate chisel ho separated iho obsidian ])ebl)le into two parts; 
then giving a blow to the fractured side he split off a slab a ijuarter of an inch in 
thickness. Holding the piece against his anvil with the thumb and finger of his left 
hand, he connnenced a series of continuous blows, every one of which chipped ofl' 
fragments of the l)rittle substance. It gradually seemed to ac(|uire shape. After 
finishing the base of the arrowhead (the whole being little over an inch in length; 
he began by striking gentle blows, everyone of which I expected would lireak it 
into pieces. Yet such was his adroit application, his skill, and dexterity, that in 
little over an hour he produced a perfect obsidian arrowhead. 

I then requested him to carve one from the remains of a broken botth^, which, 
after two failures, he succeeded in df)ing. He gave as a reason for his ill success 
that he did not understand the grain of the glass. No sculptor ever handled a chisel 
with greater precision, or more carefully measured the weight and effect of every 
blow, than did this ingenious Indian ; for even among them arrow making is a dis- 
tinct i>rofession, in which lew attain excellence. In a moment all I had read of the 
hardening of cojiper for the working of flint axes, etc., vanished before the simplest 
mechanical process. 

]\Ir. T. 11. Peale of the scientific corps of the United States Exploring? 
Expedition, witnessed the makinfj of arrowpoints among the Shasta and 
northern California Indians. He says that the Hakes were struck oft' 
from the mass of jas])er, agate, or chalcedony, by a Wow with a round- 
faced stone, and that the edges were chipped by the application of a 
notch in a piece of horn, as a glazier chips glass. The notches in the 
horn tool were of different size and depths, in order to suit the Avork to 
be done.'^ 

Every American collector, as well as archfeologist, has read -lohn 
Smith's description of the making of arrowpoints l)y the \"irginia Indians.' 

His arrowhead he quickly maketh witli a little bone, which he ever weareth at his 
bracer, of a splint of a stone or glasse in tlie form of a heart, and these they glew to 
the end of their arrowes.

988 REPORT OP NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1897. 

Torquemada* says: 

They had, aud still liave, workmeu who make knives of a certain hlack stone or 
flint, which it is a most wonderful aud admirable thing to see them make out of the 
stone; and the ingenuity which invented this art is much to he praised. They are 
made and got out of the stone (if one can exi)lain it) in this manner: One of these 
Indian workmen sits down upon the ground and takes a piece of this black stone, 
which is like Jet, and hard as flint, and is a stone which might be called ])re(ious, 
more beautilul aud brilliant than alabaster or jasper, so much so that of it are made 
tablets aud mirrors. The ])iece they take is about 8 inches long, or rather more, 
and as thick as one's leg or rather less, and cylindrical. They have a stick as large 
as the shaft of a lauce, and 3 cubits, or rather more, iu length, aud at the end of it 
they fasten firmly anothtu" piece of wood 8 inches long, to give more weight to this 
part, then pressing their naked feet together, they hold the stones as with a pair of 
pincers or the vise of a carpenter's bench. They take the stick (which is cut oft' 
smooth at the end) with both hands, and set it well home against the edge of the 
front of the stone, which also is cut smooth in that part; and then they press it 
against their breast, aud with the force of the pressure there flies oft' a knife, with 
its point and edge on each side, as neatly as if one were to make them of a turnip 
with a sharp knife, or of iron in the fire. Then they sharpen it on a stone, using a 
hone to give it a very fine edge; aud in a very short time these workmen will make 
more than 20 knives in the aforesaid manner. They come out of the same shape as 
our barbers' lancets, except that they have a rib up the middle, aud have a slight 
graceful curve toward the point. They will cut aud shave the hair the first time 
they are used, at the first cut nearly as well as a steel razor, but they lose their edge 
at the second cut; aud so to finish shaving one's beard or hair, one after another has 
to be used; though indeed they are cheap, aud spoiling them is of no consequence. 
Many Spaniards, both regular and seculai clergy, have been shaved with them, 
especially at the beginning of the colonization of these realms, when there was no 
such abuudauce as now of the necessary instruments and i)eople who gain their 
livelihood by practicing this occupation. But I conclude by saying that it is an 
admirable thing to see them made, and no small argument for the capacity of the 
men Avho found out such an invention. 

Tylor^ says: 

Hernandez gives a similar account of the process. He compares the wooden instru- 
ment used to a crossbow. It was evidently a T-shaped implement, and the work- 
man held the crosspiece with his two hands agaiust his breast, while the end of the 
straight stick rested on the stone. He furthermore gives a description of the mak- 
ing of the well known maquahuitl, or Aztec war club, Avhich was armed on both 
sides with a row of obsidian knives, or teeth, stuck into holes with a kind of gum. 
With this instrument, he says, a man could be cut iu half at a blow — an absurd 
statement which has l)een repeated by more modern writers.
