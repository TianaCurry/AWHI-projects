JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF 
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 



Annual Meeting op the Board of Eegents. 

January 24, 180 

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted 
January 8, 1890, by which its stated annual meeting occurs on the fourth 
Wednesday of January, the Board met to-day at 10 o'clock a. m. 

Present: The Chancellor (the Hon. M. W. Fuller), in the chair; the 
Vice-President (the Hon. A. E. Stevenson), the Hon. J. S. Morrill, the 
Hon. S. M. Cullom, the Hon. George Gray, the Hon. Joseph Wheeler, 
the Hon. W. C. P. Breckinridge, the Hon. E. K. Hitt, Dr. James C. 
Welling, Dr. James B. Angell, and the Secretary, Mr. S. P. Langley. 

Excuses for nonattendance were read from Dr. William Preston 
Johnston and the Hon. J. B. Henderson, on account of illness, and from 
Dr. Henry Copp^e, on account of pressing business engagements. 

At the Chancellor's suggestion, the Secretary read in abstract the 
minutes of the last meeting, which were approved. 

The Secretary then announced the following changes in the Board 
of Kegents since the last meeting: 

The term of Senator George Gray having expired, he was on March 
20, 1893, reappointed Regent by the Vice-President. 

Representative R. R. Hitt, who was on August 11, 1893, appointed 
by the Speaker of the House of Representatives to fill the vacancy 
occasioned by the resignation of Mr. Lodge, was on January 4, 1894, 
reappointed. The terms of Representative Breckinridge, of Kentucky, 
and Wheeler, of Alabama, having expired, they also were reappointed 
Regents by the Speaker on January 4, 1894. 

The Secretary presented his annual report to the Board of Regents 
for the year ending June 30, 1893, with a few remarks concerning the 
increase in the activities of the Institution, during which he called 
attention to its recent contributions to science, made in its Astro- 
physical Observatory; and also to the iiresent large number of cor- 
respondents, of which there were nearly 24,000, scattered throughout 
the whole globe. 

On motion the report was accepted. 

Dr. Welling, on behalf of his colleagues, presented the report of the 
executive committee for the year ending June 30, 1893, explaining that 



XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 

the committee had examined every account and found them in each 
instance correct. 

On motion the report was adopted. 

Dr. Welling, in behalf of his colleagues, submitted a resolution rela- 
tive to income and expenditures, placing the income of the Institution 
in the hands of the Secretary for his administration. Dr. Welling 
called the attention of the Eegents to a change in the usual wording 
of the resolution, by the omission of some words liable to an inter- 
pretation which might tend to prejudicially limit the activities of the 
Institution. 

The i-esolution (which had been passed in nearly the form now 
recommended during earlier years) had since 1888 been framed in the 
following words: 

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending .Tune 

30, , be aijpropriated for the service of the Institution, to he expended hy the 

Secretary with the advice of the executive committee upon the basis of the opera- 
tions described in the last annual report of said committee, with full discretion on 
the part of the Secretary as to items of expenditures properly falling under each of 
the heads embraced in the established conduct of the Institution. 

This language was a departure from the form previously in use, and 
for the reasons stated (among which were that the words ^'upon the 
basis of the operations described in the last annual report of said com- 
mittee" might seem to restrict the Secretary in the discharge of his 
scientific trusts) the committee offered the following resolution, the 
propriety of which must be apparent: 

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895, 
be aiiproiiriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the Secretary, 
with the advice of the executive committee, with lull discretion on the part of the 
Secretary as to items. 

On motion the resolution was unanimously adopted. 

A modiflcati(m of the act of Congress organizing the Institution, with 
special reference to the constitution of the Establishment, was discussed 
at some length in connection with bills introduced in the Senate bear- 
ing upon the subject by Senators Morrill and Cullom. 

The Secretary stated that his attention had been called to the fact 
tliat a gentleman, a resident of Washington, Mr. Kobert Stanton Avery, 
intended to make the Smithsonian Institution his residuary legatee, 
and had prepared the form of a will, which was submitted. 

The Secretary had satisfied himself that Mr. Avery had had this 
purpose before him for years, and that the will of which he had just 
spoken was not an embodiment of any lately entertained or suddenly 
conceived idea, but the expression of a long-matured purpose. He 
fnrther stated that Mr. Avery was desirous of knowing whether the 
liegents were likely to accept his bequest. 

After some discussion the matter was, on motion of Mr. Breckinridge, 
referred to tlie executive committee with instructions to write to Mr. 
Avery acknowledging the receipt of the proposed will, thanking him 



JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIII 

for it, declaring tluit tlie Board will accept, and expressing its appreci- 
ation. 

The Secretary recalled the attention of the Board to the fact that at 
the last meeting he had stated that he had been informally advised by 
Dr. Chambers, the executor of Mr. Hodgkins's estate, that the latter 
had placed in the hands of a Kew York trust company certain bonds to 
be contributed after Mr. Hodgkins's death to the unrestricted portion 
of his donation to the institution; and that the Eegents, with this 
understanding, had authorized the Secretary to add to this certain 
accrued interest and to deposit the same with the other funds of the 
institution in the Treasury, making the Hodgkins donation thus placed 
in the Treasury $250,000, of which the income of $100,000 was for the 
special purpose of the increase and diffusion of knowledge respecting 
the properties of atmospheric air as beneficial to man, and $150,000 
without restriction. 

The Secretary had to state that, while he had received the bonds, he 
had not thought himself justified in making this deiwsit in the Treas- 
ury without further instructions from the Eegents; and for this reason, 
that it apiieared that the executor had been misinformed as to the con- 
ditions under which they were left, for when the Secretary was called 
upon by the trust company to actually receipt for the bonds it was 
found that Mr. Hodgkins had given them to form a portion not of the 
unrestricted, but of the restricted part of his gift. 

The Secretary read a communication from the surrogate of the court 
of Suffolk County, N. Y., giving a statement of the condition of the 
Hodgkins property, and he read also a statement submitted by the 
executor concerning the residuary estate, and he asked instructions of 
the Eegents as to whether, under existing circumstances, he shovild 
deposit the amounts referred to in the Treasury, or should continue to 
hold the bonds, or whether he should take other action. 

After some further discussion, Dr. Angell read the following resolu- 
tions : 

Resolved, That the executive committee and the Secretary are hereby constituted 
a permanent committee, with authority to accept for the Institution any property, 
real, personal, or mixed, that may be given to it for its purposes, "the increase and 
diffusion of knowledge among men," with power to sell or to convert such property, 
and to invest the proceeds in such manner as may appear to them for the interests 
of the Institution : Provided, That no deposit be made of such proceeds with the per- 
manent fund in the United States Treasury other than by special resolution of the 
Regents. 

Resolved, That the income derived from the property administered by the com- 
mittee constituted by the preceding resolution be a^ipropriated for the service of 
the Institution, to be expended by the Secretary under the conditions of the resolu- 
tion relative to income and expenditures adopted by the Board of Regents. 

Resolved, That the Secretary is authorized to deposit in the United States Treas- 
ury, at 6 per cent interest, under the terms of section 5591 of Title i.xxiii of the 
Revised Statutes of the United States, such sums of money as may be placed unre- 
strictedly at the disposition of the Institution not exceeding $97,000. 

On motion of Senator Gray the resolutions were adopted. 



XIV JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 

The Secretary said that lie had hoped that Congress wouhl pass an 
act providing- for the erection of a statne of his eminent predecessor, 
Secretary 1 >aird, as it had done in the case ol" Secretary Ilenry. Ettbrts 
iu this direction in the past had, however, failed, but though he had 
foregone neither the hope nor the intention, the present time was evi- 
dently not opportune to secure such legislation. There was now no 
altogether satisfactory likeness of Secretary Baird. The Secretary 
desired to submit to the Board of Regents the propriety of authorizing 
the execution of an oil portrait of the late Secretary, which, as in the 
case of the one of Secretary Ilenry, might be placed in the Eegeuts' 
Room in perpetual remembrance of him. 

Senator Morrill then read the following resolution, which was adopted : 

Resolved, That tLe Secretary be requested to have a life-size portrait of tlie late 
Secretary of the Institution (Spencer F. Baird) painted by some comjietent artist, 
which, when finished, may be preserved iu the room occupied by the Regents for 
their meetings. 

The Secretary then stated to the Board that, under its resolution to 
provide a new seal for the Institution, he had consulted Mr. Augustus 
St. Gaudens, the eminent sculptor, who had taken interest in the mat- 
ter, giving his personal suiiervision to the preparation and arrangement 
of the lettering. [The Secretary here exhibited an imx)ression of a 
seal executed from Mr. St. Gaudens's design.] Mr, St. Gaudens had, 
when asked to render a bill, replied that he did not desire to submit an 
account. The Secretary therefore thought that some action of the 
Regents would be appropriate. 

Senator Gray submitted the following resolution: 

Besolved, That the Secretary be requested to convey, in fitting terms, tlie thanks of 
the Board of Regents to Mr. Augustus St. Gaudens for his design for a new seal for 
the Institution. 

On motion the resolution was adopted. 

The Secretary brought to the attention of the Board of Regents the 
fact that the late Chinese minister had presented to it an ancient and 
specially rare bronze vase, the receipt of which had been noted only by 
the ordinary form of acknowledgment at the time, and he therefore 
thought that the Regents might like to authorize him to give, even at 
this late day, some more formal expression of their thanks. 

Thereupon Mr. Gray submitted the following resolution : 

liesoliivd, That the Secretary is requested to convey, in fitting terms, the thanks of 
the Board of Regents to his excellency Chang Yen Hoon, member of the ministry of 
the Tsung Li Yaincn, for the gift of a valuable ancient vase, presented by him to the 
Smithsonian Institution (in June, 1889). 

On motion the resolution was unanimously adopted. 
There beinpf no further business to come before the Board, on motion 
it adjourned.

expend, or create any liability of any kind for, any sum in excess of the 
appropriations herein made, or create any dehciency. (Sundry civil

2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Reoents adopted 
January 8, 1890, by which its annual meeting occurs on the fourth 
Wednesday of each year, the Board met on January 24, 1894, at 10 
o'clock a, in. The journal of its proceedings willbe found, as hitherto, 
in- the annual report of the Boa^'d to Congress, though reference is 
made later on in tliis report to several matters npon which action was 
taken at that meetiug. 

There has been no change in the personnel of the Board during the 
year, the Regents whose terms have expired having been reappointed, 
as follows : 

Dr. Andrew D. White, reappointed by joint resolution of Congress 
approved by the President, March 10, 1894. 

The Honorabfe Joseph Wheeler, the Honorable W. C. P. Breckin- 
ridge, and the Honorable Robert R. Hitt, reappointed by the Speaker 
of the House of Representatives on January 4, 1894. 

ADMINISTRATION. 

I desire to repeat the recommendation contained in my Last report 
that Congress be asked to make an appropriation to cover the expenses 
incurred by the Institution incident to the administration of its Gov- 
ernment trusts. These expenses are not specifically provided for by 
any of the present appropriations, since they belong not singly to tbe 
National Museum, or to the Bureau of Ethnology, or to the Inter- 
national Exchange Service, or the like, but to expenditures common to 
all of them, and which are not arranged for by the terms of the appro- 
priations for any one. I repeat that, in the words of a previous report, 
it is in the interests of economy that this expenditure should be met 
from some common source, owing to the limited size of the establish- 
ments in question, some of which are rather assimilable to divisions 
than to bureaus. It is evident, for instance, that an appropriation of 
$17,000 for international exchanges, or an appropriation of $10,000 for 
an observatory, can not each so well bear the separate provision of a 
disbursing officer, a stenographer, and the other like employees, as in 
the case of larger bureaus, but that their limited needs can be better and 
more economically managed by not dupbcating such offices. There is, 
however, no practicable way of arranging this in compliance with the 
present terms of the appropriations, which may be said to tacitly assume 
that each of these bureaus or divisions is thus completely provided for. 
It is in some cases impossible that it should be so without the expend- 
iture of greatly more than the appropriated sum, and the terms of the 
appropriations should, in the interest of economy, either recognize the 
propriety of meetiug each bureau's share of these common expenses out 
of each one's appropriation or else out of a special appropriation made 
in their common interest. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3 

FINANCES. 

The permanent funds of the Institution are as follows: 

Bequest of Smithsou, 184G $515, 169. 00 

Residuary legacy of Suiithson, 1867 26, 210. 63 

Deposits from saviugs of iucoiue, 1867 108, 620. 37 

Bequest of James Hamilton, 1875 1^ 000. 00 

Bequest of Simeon Habel, 1880 500. 00 

Deposits from proceeds of sale of bonds, 1881 51, 500. 00 

Gift of Thomas G. Hodgkins, 1891 200, 000. 00 

Portion of residuary legacy, Thomas G. Hodgkins, 1894 8, 000. 00 

Total permanent fund 911, 000. 00 

By act of Congress approved by the President March 12, 1894, an 
anieudnient was made to section ooUl of the Eevised Statutes, as 
follows : 

The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive 
into the Treasury, on the same terms as the original bequest of James 
Smithson, such sums as the Kegents may, from time to time, see tit to 
deposit, not exceeding, with the original bequest, the sum of $1,000,000, 

rroridedj That this shall not operate as a limitation on the power of 
the Smithsonian Institution to receive money or other property by gift, 
bequest, or devise, and to hold and dispose of the same in promotion of 
the i^urposes thexeof. 

The above specified permanent fuml is dejiosited, under section 5591, 
of the Revised Statutes, modified as above noted, in the Treasury of the 
United States, bearing interest at per cent. per annum, the interest 
alone being used in carrying out the aims of the Institution. 

At the beginning of the fiscal year, July 1, 1S93, the uuexpended 
balance from the income and from other sources, as stated in my report 
for last year, was $57,092.82. Interest on the permanent fund, amount- 
ing to $54,180, was received during the year, which, together with a 
sum of $7,787.06, received from the sale t»f publications and from mis- 
cellaneous sources, and $8,000 received as a portion of the residuary 
legacy from the estate of Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins, made the total 
receipts $09,967.06. 

The entire expenditures during the year, including the $8,000 men- 
tioned above, which was added to the permanent fund, amounted to 
$67,161.38, for the details of which reference is made to the report of 
the executive committee. On June 30, 1891, the balance in the Treas- 
ury of the United States to the credit of the Secretary for the expenses 
of the Institution was $59,598.50, which includes the sum of $10,000 
referred to in previous reports, $5,000 received from the estate of Dr. J. 
H. Kidder, and a like sum from Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, the latter 
a gift made persoimlly to the Secretary to promote certain jdiysical 
researches. This latter sum was, with the donor's consent, deposited 
by the Secretary to the credit of the current funds of the Institution. 

The Eegents also hold the sum of $42,000, received upon the death 



4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

of Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins, in approved railroad bonds, and forming 
a part of the fund established by him for investigations, etc., of the 
properties of atmospheric air. 

This balance also inclndes the interest accnmmnlated on the Hodg- 
kins donation, which is held against certain contingent obligations, 
and interest on the Hamilton fnnd, besides relatively considerable snms 
held to meet obligations which may be expected to mature as the result 
of different scientific investigations or publications in progress. 

The Institution has been charged with the disbursement, during the 
fiscal year 1803-94, of the following appropriations: 

For international exchanges $14, 500 

For North American Ethnology '10, 000 

For United States National Mnscum: 

Preservation of collections 132, 500 

Fnrnitnro and fixtures 10, 000 

Heating and lighting 11, 000 

Postage 500 

For National Zoological Park 50, 000 

For Astro-physical Observatory 9, 000 

All vouchers and checks for the disbursements have been examined 
by the executive committee, and the expenditures will be found reported 
in accordance with the i:»rovisions of thf sundry civil acts of October 
2, 1888, and August 5, 1892, in a letter addressed to the Speaker of the 
House of Eepreseutatives. 

The vouchers for all the expenditures from the Smithsonian fund 
proper have been likewise examined and their correctness certified to 
by the executive committee, whose statement will be published, together 
with the accounts of the funds appropriated by Congress, in that com- 
mittee's report. 

The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895, for carrying- 
on the Government interests under the charge of the Smithsonian 
Institution, and forwarded as usual to the Secretary of the Treasury, 
were as follows : 

International exchange $23, 000 

North American Ethnology 50, 000 

National Mnseum : 

Preservation of collections 180, 000 

Heating and lighting 15, 000 

Fnrnitnre and fixtures 20, 000 

Postage 500 

G all eries 8, 000 

Steam boilers 4, 000 

National Zoological Park 75, 000 

Astro-physical Observatory 10, 000 

BUILDINGS. 

The crowding of objects, belonging to the nation, in the halls of the 
Institution and the Museum building, and in their workrooms, which 
should be devoted to other purposes, has already been spoken of by me in 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5 

previous reports. This condition, which seems to have almost reached 
a limit of evil from the impossibility of further storage of such objects, 
was brought to the esi^ecial attention of the last Congress, when it 
became necessary to vacate the storage rooms occupied by the National 
Museum in the old Armory building on account of intended changes 
authorized by Congress for the benefit of the Fish Commission. 

At this time a small building in the city several squares distant was 
rented, under authority from Congress, for the storage of the materials, 
and for the workshops removed from the Armory building, but this made 
no provision for the articles returned from the Chicago Exposition. 

At the request of the Secretary of Agriculture, the Institution, 
which has been made by Congress the depository of all such objects, 
felt obliged to resume the care of an immense collection of plants, con- 
stituting the National Herbarium, which had previously been placed by 
the Institution in the charge of that Department, and which it had now, 
in fact, no room for. The collection was stored, under the charge of 
the Dei)artment of Agriculture, in a building which was not fireproof, 
and this fact was stated by the Department as influencing it in its 
request that the Institution should resume charge of them, but the Insti- 
tution itself has no place to put them, except in sheds more insecure than 
those from which they came. It is true that room has been made for 
them witliin the fireproof portion of the building, but only by the 
transfer of a large mass of other objects to the wooden sheds, which 
are in a condition of extreme danger. I can give a no more definite 
idea of the alarming condition here than by saying that it is such that 
no insurance company would place risks on the sheds except at very 
high rates. 

The congestion in question has compelled the use not only of rooms 
belonging to the Museum building proper, for the accommodation of 
objects like those which came from the Chicago Exposition, but of 
those of the Institution intended for other purposes, such as the 
"Chapel," whose lofty vaulted roof was made flrepoof by Congress 
three years ago with quite another destination than the actual use 
which necessity has imposed for the time. 

It seems almost superfluous, after Avhat has just been said, for me to 
recalkin other terms the need of more adequate accommodations for the 
national collections, but I may again refer to what has been set forth 
at length on this subject in my previous reports, more especially in 
that for 1892. 

REPAIRS TO THE SMITHSONIAN BUILDING. 

In the contemplation of the first architect, the Smithsonian building 
was intended to produce the effect of a Norman castle, and its tall 
towers, narrow embrasures, and like features do attain, if not archaj- 
ological correctness, at any rate a certain admitted attractiveness of 
exterior. This has been reached, however, as is well known, not only 



6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

at a disproportionate outlay of money from the limited Smithsonian 
fund (which was here, in fact, expended largely for the benefit of the 
city in furnishing' it with such a picturesque building), but at a cost of 
an amount of perm;iuent discomfort to the inmates which those who 
are not there employed can liardly appreciate. 

In particular, the narroAV windows and the small diamond panes of 
glass admit so little light that in winter days some of the rooms where 
clerical work is carried on, need to be artificially lighted, and in all 
cases the occupants lose the advantage of what ought to be abundant 
light, considering tlieir open surroundings in the middle of a park. I 
think it well to state that while I should have made many more changes 
in the interest of the comfort and health of the clerical occupants of the 
building if I had had the means to do so, I have never felt at liberty 
to alter the external appearance of the building when alteration 
could possibly be avoided, and I have therefore never authorized the 
enlargement of any of the apertures in the stone work, or made any 
changes of this kind which could be understood as modifying the 
structural features (except in improving tlie sanitary conditions of the 
basement), and when any change is mentioned here it will always be 
understood that it is essentially the work of the carpenter iu providing 
for larger inside frames and larger lights in the sashes, and in like 
alterations. 

Thus in the east wing of the building, iu the fourth story, a room 
for containing the archives of the Institution has been provided, which 
is well lighted by one of the few large windows the building possesses, 
and which has been fitted for more convenient reference to the records 
of the Institution. The second floor has been made brighter by 
repainting and by some additional floor lights in the third floor, and 
the windows in the room especially set apart for the safe-keeping of 
the engravings and books of art belonging to the Institution have been 
thus enlarged, while some of the rooms on the second floor have been 
imjiroved by slight alterations in the Avindow frames. On the first 
floor additional quarters were iirovided for the library in the rooms 
which were vacated by the transfer of the exchange department to the 
lower fio(n-. 

I have been enabled to make the above small changes at the expense 
of the Smithsonian fund, but a restrictiAe clause contained in the 
appropriation act of August 30, 1890, for repairs to the Smithsonian 
Institution, having been removed by a clause in the sundry civil act 
for the year ending June 30, 1894, I have, with a portion of the unex- 
pended amount of this appropriation, been also able to transform a suite 
of dark ami damp rooms in the basement on the south side into well- 
lighted and comfortable, though too limited offices, in which every 
attention has been ])aid to sanitation. The exchange bureau continues 
to occuj^y these, but they were barely sufficient at first, and, through 
the constant increase of the demand of the Government service, addi- 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7 

tional ixiom for these exchanges will soon be called for, while the stor- 
age facilities of the Institution are now otherwise severely taxed. 

RESEARCH. 

As I have elsewhere remarked, it appears to be an essential portion 
of the original scheme of the government of the Institution that its 
Secretary should be expected to advance knowledge, whether in letters 
or in science, by personal research; and resolutions of the Regents 
formally request the Secretary to continue his investigations in physi- 
cal science, and to present their results for publication in the Smith- 
sonian " Contributions." 

The advancement of science through original research at the hands 
of those eminent men, Henry and Baird, the former Secretaries of this 
Institution, is known to all, but though the Secretary may be still 
exi)ected to personally contribute to the advancement of science, or art, 
or letters, by his individual efibrts, it is certain that the increasing 
demands of time for labors of administration had graatly limited the 
possibility of this, even in the time of Henry, and that at the present 
day administrative duties, and especially those connected with the care 
of Government interests, constitute a barrier to such investigations, 
which is all but impassable. 

I have, however, given such limited time as could be spared from 
administrative duties largely to the continuation of the researches 
upon the solar spectrum mentioned in my last rei)ort. This work, car- 
ried on in the Astro-physical Observatory, is believed to be of more than 
common importance, and is referred to at more length in connection with 
the observatory report of this year. 

The investigations, referred to in previous reports, upon aerody- 
namics have been continued intermittently. They are not complete, 
but they appear to point to conclusions of general and unusual interest. 

Mention may also be made here of a grant of $50 in December, 1893, 
to the director of the Lick Observatory, Prof. E. S. Holdeu, for experi- 
ments in solar photography, and of a grant of a like amount in May, 
1891, to Dr. A. Ct. Webster, of Clark University, for certain researches 
in the velocity of electrodynamic disturbances in wires. 

Mr. W. A. Eddy was likewise aided to the amount of $50 in certain 
exi)eriments in the study of the electrical and other conditions of the 
upper atmosphere by means of kites. 

Investigations aided by the Hodgkins fund, and special researches 
carried on in the Astro-physical Observatory are mentioned on another 
page. 

The researches referred to above are connected altogether with the 
physical sciences, since aid to original research in the biological sciences 
has been largely, though indirectly, provided through the Institution's 
connection with the National Museum and otherwise. 

The subscription has been continued for twenty copies of the Astro- 



8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

nomical Journal as a slight aid to its publication, the separate numbers 
of the journal being sent regularly to foreign libraries and observatories 
as exchanges of the Institution. 

EXPLORATIONS. 

The explorations of the Institution during the year have beeu car- 
ried on chiefly through the National Museum and the Bureau of Eth- 
nology. Natural history and ethnological explorations and studies were 
made in Kashmir, India, the Seychelles and adjacent islands, by Dr. 
William L. Abbott; by Professor Cook, in Liberia; by Consul-General 
Crawford, in Finland, and by other collaborators of the Institution in 
Central and South America and the West Indies, resulting in very 
valuable additions to the Museum collection. In New Mexico and Ari- 
zona, as also in several localities in the Eastern States, arch;eological 
explorations by the Bureau of Ethnology have added much to our 
knowledge of the habits and customs of tlie aborigines. The San Juan 
Yalley and the Canyon de Chelly were fonnd to be rich in remains of 
ancient American structures, indicating a numerous population. Some 
of the aboriginal songs of the Kiowa, Arapahoe, and Cheyenne Indians 
were preserved with the aid of the graphophone. I have on other 
pages reviewed some of these explorations more in detail. 

A brief abstract of Mr. Ilockhill's explorations in Mongolia and 
Tibet, in 1891 and 1892, made partly under the auspices of the Insti- 
tution, was published in the Annual Eeport for 1892. The detailed 
diary of his journey is now in the hands of the printer, and will form 
an octavo volume of about 400 pages, with numerous illustrations. 
This book is believed to be of particular interest at the present time. 

PUBLICATIONS. 

One of the most important functions of the Institution is the diffu- 
sion of knowledge by means of i)ublications, and in this branch of 
work the past year has been an active one. Since my last report there 
have been i)ublished by the Smithsonian and its bureaus twelve vol- 
umes and eighty-two pamphlets or parts of volumes, aggregating 
5,854 printed pages, covering practically every branch of natural and 
physical science. 

The publications of the Institution itself include three principal 
series — Contributions to Knowledge, the Miscellaneous Collections, 
and the Annual Reports. The first two are printed at the exi^ense of 
the Smithsonian fund, while the reports are Government documents. 

Contributions to KnowJeilge. — The Contributions to Knowledge are in 
quarto form, and are the most important of the series. They include 
only memoirs of extended original investigations and researches, 
advancing what are believed to be new truths, and constituting, there- 
fore, positive additions to human knowledge. Twenty-seven volumes 
of these have been comijleted since the Institution was founded, 
including 125 memoirs pertaining to all branches of knowledge. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9 

It is the present practice to publish occasionally memoirs from the 
Contributions in separate form, to be afterwards combined in a volume 
when enough have been completed. Only one such memoir of Contri- 
butions has been prepared during the year, which is a communication 
by the Secretary under the title of The Internal Work of the Wind. 

A volume of the Contributions is now passing through the press, and, 
though its full description belongs more properly to a later report, it 
may be stated here that its subject is oceanic ichthyology, that it is 
prepared by Dr. G. Brown Goode and Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, and that 
the work, which will be a joint publication of the Institution and the 
National Museum, is an exhaustive dissertation on the fishes of the 
ocean depths and particularly those of the North Atlantic Basin. 

As another memoir of Contributions, I had hoped to complete the 
publication of the photographic volume on the moon, to which I have 
called attention in j)revious reports, but the science of photograjihy 
has not yet progressed sufiBciently to meet the requirements of the 
work. 

Other memoirs are in preparation, to which attention will be called 
in my next report. 

Miscellaneons Collections,— The Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collec- 
tions is an octavo series intended to include works of scientific value, 
but of less original importance than the Contributions to Knowledge. 

Thirty-five complete volumes of Collections have been issued since 
the Institution was founded, and four additional volumes are now in 
preparation, parts of volumes 35 to 38 having already been published. 

Volume XXXV of the Collections will include the Smithsonian Mete- 
orological, Geograjihical, and Physical Tables. These tables are 
intended to replace in modernized form and with newer knowledge the 
Guyot Meteorological and Physical Tables, first published in 1852, and 
which has since been a standard work of reference for investigators. 
The first part of the volume, the Meteorological Tables, was published 
last year. The Geographical Tables, prepared by Professor Woodward , 
have been put in type during this year, but not yet issued ; these tables 
make a volume of 288 pages. The Physical Tables are now being pre- 
pared by Prof. Thomas Gray, and may be expected to be completed in 
1895. 

Volume XXXVI is a single work, a very comprehensive Select Bibli- 
ography of Chemistry, covering the four hundred years from 1492 
to 1892, prepared by Dr. H, Carrington Bolton. This volume was pub- 
lished in 1893, but the first edition was soon exhausted, and it became 
necessary to issue a second edition during the present year. 

There is now in progress the preparation of a supplement to this 
Bibliography of Chemistry, to include titles of works down to 1895, as 
well as some additions to the first volume. It is expected that the 
supplement will number about 5,000 titles. 

This bibliography actually aims to include everything that is of 



10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

importance in the literature of cbeniistry, tiie word "Select" being 
only added as an indication that the work does not profess absolute 
completeness. It represents the labors of a lifetime on the part of a 
most industrious student of the bibliography of chemistry, and is a 
work of reference of such value tbat is is believed it will be a necessity 
to every chemical investigator. 

Volume xxxvii of the Collections is a very complete Index to the 
genera and species of the Foraminifera, by Prof. C. Davies Sherborn,of 
London. The technical character of this work has rendered prompt 
publication impracticable. The first part of the volume, "A to non," 
was issued during the year, and the second part is in progress. 

Volume XXXVIII of the Collections is also in progress and consists 
of several short papers, including "Principles and method of classifi- 
cation of varieties of tlie human species;" "Bibliography of Aceto- Acetic; 
Ester ;" "Indexes to literatures of Cerium and Lanthanum,"' and " Index 
to literature of Didymium." These indexes to chemical literature are 
published in continuation of the series begun some years ago under the 
recommendation of the American Association for the Advancement of 
Science. 

A special octavo volume, now in press, consists of the Diary of a 
Journey through Mongolia and Tibet, by Mr. W. W. Eockhill. This 
expedition was carried on in part under the auspices of the Institu- 
tion, and the diary is, in the main, a description of the cliaracteristic 
geographical and ethnological features of those countries, so seldom 
visited by Europeans. A large map, on a scale of 32 miles to the inch, 
shows the route traversed by Mr. Rockhilj, and is in itself a valuable 
contribution to our knowledge of the region. 

Following the usual custom, the several papers comprised in the 
general appendix of the annual report have been issued separately 
in pamphlet form ; about sixty of these pamphlets were issued dur- 
ing this year, as enumerated in the editor's report. 

SmitJtsonian annual reports. — The delayed annual reports of the 
Institution for the years 1891 and 18915 have been received and distrib- 
uted, as also the annual reports of the United States National Museum 
for those years. 

The Secretary's report for 1893 was issued in January in pamphlet 
form. The manuscript of the general appendix to the report of the 
Institution for 189;5 was sent to the printer on March 31, and the entire 
volume was stereotyped and press work in i)rogress early in elune, 
thus bringing the work np to date, and avoiding the tedious delays 
of previous years. 

Reports of the Bureau of Ethnology. — Tlie ninth and the tenth annual 
reports of the Bureau of Ethnology to the Secretary of the Institution 
have both been received during the year. These volumes fully main- 
tain the character established for the series, and are gradually bringing 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 11 

up tbe arrearage of the work. The eleventh and twelfth annual reports 
are in the hands of the i)rinter and will soon be completed. Several 
lini)ers in the Bulletin series were issued during the year. 

Proceedings and Bulletins of the Wat Ion al Museum. — The publications 
of the Museum are mentioned on another page under the general head 
of "The National Museum." 

LIBRARY. 

In my report for 1S87-88 I detaile<l a plan for increasing the library 
by exchanges. Lists of periodicals were secured from the British 
Museum, several universities, and a great number of leading special- 
ists, and these lists were carefully revised in the former year and corre- 
spondence then entered upon with each society and journal represented 
on them. This Work has now been completed, after nearly seven years 
of labor. Since 1887, 5,831 letters have been written, resulting in the 
addition of 1,853 i\q,\\ periodicals to the list of those received, and entire 
or partial completion of 1,042 defective series. It is already time to 
recommence this labor, vfhich ougnt to be never ending if the i)eriodi- 
cal collections of the Institution are to continue to be wliat they are 
believed to be to-day — the completest in the Avorld. Accordingly it is 
my intention to have new lists i^repared and to continue this special 
feature of the work of adding to the lil)rary by exchange during the 
coming year. 

Through the provision of new quarters for the Bureau of Interna- 
tional Exchanges I have been enabled to assign two additional rooms 
for the use of the library, the one for a collection of books required for 
reference, and the other as an office for the librarian, to the very great 
advantage of the service. A room has also been set apart for the 
collection of prints belonging to the Institution. 

The reading room of tlie Institution is no longer adequate for the 
large collection of scientific periodicals received and for the persons 
desiring to consult them. As it is not possible to assign any additional 
room for the library at present, I am considering a plan for some modi- 
fications in the present reading room which will render it more suitable 
to its purpose. 

The total number of imblications of every kind received during the 
past pear reached 39,82(3, an increase of nearly 9,000 over the previous 
year. 

THE HODGKINS FUND. 

The many responses to the large number of circulars announcing 
the terms of the Hodgkins competition, and the numerous rec^uests 
for further information, have sliown that a widespread interest in the 
subject has been awakened. In February, 1894, a second edition of the 
circulars announcing the jirizes became necessary, which was issued

in English, French, and German, and widely distributed. In answer 
to numerous inquiries the followin^c: supplementary circular, descriptive 
of the general character and work of tlie Institution, aiul makiug 
mention of the Hodgkins fund, was also prepared and translated into 
French and German, and through the courtesy of the Department of 
State a number of copies were sent to several of the American 
embassies in Europe for their general use, in answering questions 
concerning the Smithsonian Institution: 

Smi nisoNiAN Institution, 

Washington, , 189 . 

Sir: In answer to your inquiry I am authorized to furnish the fol- 
lowing information: 

The Smithsonian Institution was originally constituted by an Act 
of the National Legislature, to administer a bequest made to the Gov- 
ernment of the United States in the eaily years of the present century. 
The purpose of the bequest was declared to be "The increase and dif 
fusion of knowledge among men," and its acceptance by tlie nation is 
the only instance of such an action in its history. The Institution, 
then, occupies a peculiar relation to the Government. It is composed 
as follows: 

MEMBERS OF THE INSTITUTION. 

Presiding Officer {ex-officio) : The President of the United 
States. 

Chancellor: The Chief Justice of the United States. 

The Vice-President of the United States. 

The Secretary of Stale. 

The Secretary ot the Treasury. 

The Secretary ot War. 

The Secretary of the Navy. 

The Postmaster-General. 

The Attorney-General. 

The Secretary of the Interior. 

The Secretary of Agriculture. 

The high functionaries above mentioned are its members ex officio, 
with tlte excei)ti(>n of the chancellor, who is elected. The law also cre- 
ates a secretary of the above body, whom it calls "the Secretary of the 
Institution." 

administration. 

The law further directs that the business of the Institntion shall be 
managed by a Board of Regents, composed of the Vice-President and 
the Chief Justice of the United States, three Senators, three members of 
the House of Kepresentatives, and six other eminent persons nominated 
by a joint resolutnm of the Senate and the House of Representatives. 

The Secretary of the Institution is also the Secretary of the lioard of 
Regents and their principal executive officer. His duties in this regard 
are analogous to those of a Director. All correspondence should be 
addressed to him. 

It will be observed that the immediate and primary object of the 
Smithsonian Institution, as above constituted, is to administer a 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13 

certain fund, of which the United States has accepted the custody, for 
the especial purpose of " the increase and diffusion of knowledge 
among men," so that its purpose in its most general sense is not limited 
to the people of the United States of America, but extends to all man- 
kind. This has been interpreted as indicating such a direction of the 
activities of the Institution as shall result — 

(1) In the increase of knowledge by original investigation and 
study, either in science or literature. 

(2) In the diffusion of tliis knowledge by publication, not only 
through the United States, but everywhere, and especially by promot- 
ing an interchange of thought among those prominent in learning 
among all nations, through its correspondents. These eml)race insti- 
tutions or societies conspicuous in art, science, or literature throughout 
the world. 

Its publications are in three principal issues, namely: The "Contribu- 
tions to Knowledge," the "Miscellaneous Collections," and the "Annual 
Eeport." jSTumerous works are published annually by it, under one of 
these forms, and distributed to its principal correspondents, while 
there is also published, at the expense of the Government, an edition 
of the Report of the Board of liegents, containing an account of the 
operations of the Institution during each year, which is distributed 
throughout the country by the Congress. 

The Institution has been autliorized by Taw to deposit its original 
fund in the Treasury of the United States, and it has further been 
authorized to accept certain special bequests made by individuals, 
where these have been such as to promote its general purpose, "The 
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men." Thus, for example, 
the Institution has accepted and administered a fund which, under the 
name of the donor, is called "The Ilodgkins fund," and which is given 
for the especial purpose of " The increase and diffusion of more exact 
knowdedge in regard to the nature and properties of atmospheric air 
in connection with the welfare of man;" this fund is also deposited in 
the Treasury of the United States. Other donations have been 
received and are administered for other specific purposes. 

The seat of the Institution is at Washington, but its activities reach 
throughout the world in various ways, and principally through the 
system of correspondence already referred to. The present number 
of correspondents is about 24,000, and by means of this system the 
Institution not only gives, but receives, communications from men of 
learning in all countries. 

In this and other ways it has gathered at Washington a special 
library of books bearing'upon the history of arts, sciences, discoveries, 
and inventions. The library now includes 300,000 titles, the greater 
pro])ortion of which is by permission of Congress deposited in the same 
building and accessible with the National Library. 

Besides the above activities, which are carried on with the special 
fund already referred to, of which the nation has consented to act as 
the guardian, there are certain bureaus or divisions of the Government 
which the legislature has placed in its especial charge, and for the cost 
of which Congress has, at different times, made special appropriations. 
In this way it has placed under the charge of the Institution the 
United States National Museum, the Bureau of International Exchanges, 
the Bureau of Ethnology, the National Zoological Park, and the Astro- 
physical Observatory. These also are administered by the Secretary,

Assistant in Charge of Office. 

In spite of the persistent effort to reach all who might be interested, 
or who might wish to contribute to the competition, it was found that 
in so wide a distribution the circilars had, in various instances, failed 
to reach those for whom they were intended. This fact led to the 
extension of the competition from July 1 to December 31, 1894. A 
circular letter announcing this change of date, and offering to return, 
at the expense of the Institution, papers which had been already sub- 
mitted, was issued in June, 1894, and mailed to all comj)etitors, besides

hodgkins prizes. 

Washington, , 1894. 

Dear Sir: I beg leave to iuform you that the time within which papers may be 
siibuiitted in competition for the Hodgliius fnncl prizes of tlie Smitlisouian Institu- 
tion, for essays in regard to the nature or properties of atmospheric air, has been 
extended from July 1 to December 31, 1894. This action has been taken for the 
reason that many of the circulars seem to have failed to reacli the persons for whom 
they were intended. 

In order that all competitors may have the advantage of this extension of time, 
the Institution will, upon request, take pleasure in returning papers already sub- 
mitted; all papers being subject to the general condition requiring delivery in 
Washington City before January 1, 1895. 

It is preferred that the name and address of each competitor be attached to the 
manuscript ; it is permitted, however, that anyone who desires it may send his name 
and address in such a form that they cau be detached from the mannscript, which 
he may identify by means of a motto. 

The manuscripts of unsuccessful candidates will be returned, if desired; but the 
proprietorship of papers to which one of the prizes has been award'^d will rest with 
the Institution, Avhich only desires to give them a Avido i)ublicity ; and no copyright 
privileges are in this case to be expected by the author. 

Papers which have been already published will not be accepted in competition 
for the prizes, but may be eligible for the medal. This medal will be awarded in 
the same way that medals are usually awarded by the principal scientific societies, 
the medalists being chosen from all investigators known to the committee of award 
and not necessarily from those alone who have submitted paiiers. 

It is requested that all packages, manuscript or printed, intended for competition 
be marked "Hodgkins competition" upon the outside of the wrapper, and be 
addressed to Mr. S. P. Langley, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Washing- 
ton City, U. S. A. 

Very respectfully, S. P. Langley, 

Secretary. 



16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

The work of the advisory committee has been going- on systematically 
daring the year; papers have been read and passed upon, and many 
applications for grants considered. 

Prof. E. W. Morley's work on the determinations of tlie density of 
oxygen and hydrogen, referred to in previous reports as aided by spe- 
cial api)aratu8 provided by the Institution, is approaching completion. 

The investigations undertaken by Dr. J. S. Billings and Br. S. Weir 
Mitchell into the nature of the peculiar substances of organic origin 
contained in the air expired by human beings, to which reference was 
made in my last report, is still continued under a grant from the Hodg- 
kins fund, as also are the researches by Dr. O. Lummer and Dr. E. 
Pringsheim, of Berlin University, on the determination of an exact 
measure of the cooling of gases while expanding, witli a view to revis- 
ing the value of that most important constant which is technically 
termed the "gamma" function. 

The limitations of the fund have, however, rendered it necessary, 
with sliglit exceptions, to postpone further action in this direction for 
the present, although it is hoped that it will i)rove practicable at a later 
date to aid certain important lesearches to which attention has been 
invited. 

CORRESPONDENCE. 

It is difficult to convey an adequate idea of the diversity of tlie nature 
of the correspondence carried on immediately in the Secretary's office. 
Without reference to the voluminous correspondence of the ]S!"ational 
Museum, or the special correspondence of the Bureau of Ethnology, the 
Zoological Park, and the Bureau of Exchanges, constant inquiries are 
received from all parts of the country for information on almost every 
conceivable topic, and requests for statistics and for information on the 
most varying scientific subjects. This correspondence all receives care- 
ful attention, and, as a part of the aim of the Institution in the "diffu- 
sion of knowledge," an effort is made to give a full reply to all such in- 
quiries, often involving an amount of labor on the part of the curators, 
as well as of those more immediately occupied with the correspondence 
of the Institution, out of proportion to the merits of the case. 

I desire to remark that this increase of correspondence, even if that 
upon the business of subordinate Government bureaus alone is consid- 
ered, calls constantly for more clerical aid and other expenses which 
there is no appropriation for, and which practically form an added 
burden on the limited Smithsouian fund, which it ought not to bear, and 
to refer in this connection to what is said uiuler "Administration." 

The entries in the registry book of letters received during the year 
number 3,6oli, but these are only the relatively important letters. 

The general card index to all the correspondence in the Secretary's 
office, which was begun on January 1, 1893, is kept up constantly to date, 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17 

and has been extended back to include all letters written or received 
since January 1, 1892. 

All corresjwndence prior to tliis current correspondence file has been 
placed in the archives, and the letters that have been received between 
1882 and 1890 have recently been bound and indexed, comjjleting the 
series of indexes to correspondence. 

Reports, memoranda, and data collected on various subjects not prop- 
erly belonging to the correspondence are preserved in a miscellaneous 
file and properly indexed. 

MISCELLANEOUS. 

The Naples table. — The anticipations in regard to t\\Q Naples table, 
which, as I have stated in the report for 1893, has been leased for a 
period of three years upon the petition of the biologists and universi- 
ties of the United States, have been apparently justified. 

Numerous apiilications for the occupancy of the table have been 
received and considered. The following, being favorably reported by 
the advisory committee, were approved by me for the present year: 

Mr. D. G. Fairchild, United States Department of Agriculture, 
received the appointment for October, November, and December, 1893. 

Dr. W. M. Wheeler, University of Chicago, was appointed for Jan- 
uary, February, and March, 1891. 

Dr. H. 0. Bumpus, Brown University, apj)ointed for February, 
March, and April, 1894. 

Prof. Lewis Murbach received an assignment of three mouths, 
beginning June 20, 1894. 

Desiring to give to all investigators an equal opportunity to avail 
themselves of the advantage of a seat at the Smithsonian table, it has 
been decided that final action upon an application may not be taken 
more than six months in advance of the date for which the table is 
desired, and that should more than one application be filed for the 
same period, in cases of presumably equal merit, the assignment shall 
be made according to priority of application. It has also been deter- 
mined that no appointment shall be made for a period of more than 
six months, although an occupant may apply for extension of time or 
for reappointment at some future date. 

Students who are appointed to the table for the full term of six 
months are desired to report to me at the close of each three months of 
their occupancy; those appointed for a shorter period are expected to 
make such report at the close of their assignment. 

In several instances the time desired by an applicant overlaps that 
of another, as is the case in February and March of 1894, but through 
the ready courtesy of Dr. Dohrn, director of the station, who kindly 
ofi^ered to arrange for the accommodation of more than one occupant of 
the table at the same time, it has thus far been found possible to make 
the appointments without disappointing a student on this account.

18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

With a view to profiting by tLe judgment of our representative biolo- 
gists in administering the affairs of the Naples table, I requested, at au 
early date, tlie president of the National Academy of Sciences, the 
president of the Society of American Naturalists, the president of the 
American Morphological Society, and the president of the Association 
of American Anatomists to nominate each one member of. an advisory 
committee, the personnel of which is as follows, I having designated 
Doctor Billings, as chairman, and Doctor Stiles, as secretary of the 
committee : 

Advisory committee, Naples table. — Dr. J. S. Billings, U. S. A., 
director of the United States Army Medical Museum, chairman; Dr. E. 
B. Wilson, j)rofessor of zoology, Columbia University; Dr. J. A. Ryder, 
professor of embryology, University of Pennsylvania; Dr.C.W. Stiles, 
zoologist, United States Department of Agriculture, secretary, 

1 am indebted to this committee for valuable aid in examining the 
testimonials accompanying applications for the occuftancy of the table 
and for recommendations with regard to appointments, as well as for 
the consideration of the various questions in connection with the assign- 
ment of the table, to which I have asked attention. The contract 
giving to the Institution the tenure of the Naples table for the term 
of three years was given in full in my last year's report. 

Seal of the Institution. — A suitable steel die has been prepared for 
the new seal of the Institution, designed by Augnstus St. Gaudens, and 
formally adopted by the Board of Regents at their meeting of January 
25, 1893, and the new seal has been affixed, when required, to formal 
j)apers since February, 1894, though the first use of the design was 
upon the circulars concerning the Hodgkins prizes, issued under date 
of March 31, 1893. 

The World's Columbian Exposition. — The display made by the Smith- 
sonian Institution, including the National Museum and the Bureau of 
Ethnology, embraced collections prepared by the following departments 
of the Museum : Ethnology, i)hysical geoh)gy, mammals, birds, reptiles, 
fishes, insects, marine invertebrates, comparative anatomy, minerals, 
prehistoric anthropology, historical collections, a collection of objects 
illustrating religious ceremonial, graphic arts, nuisical instruments, 
animal jn^oducts, and a special exhibit of domesticated animals. In 
addition, an exhibit illustrating methods of aboriginal quarrying was 
prepared by Mr. William H. Holmes, a display of Japanese potteries 
was installed by Mr. Hieromich Shugio, and an exhibit of early elec- 
trical apparatus, employed by Prof. Joseph Henry in his experiments 
which led to the discovery of the electric telegraph, was also prepared. 
Complete sets of the publications of the Smithsonian Institution and 
of the National Museum were exhibited, together with those of the 
American Historical Association. 
. These collections are fully described in the report for 1893 of the 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19 

Assistant Secretary, who acted as the representative of the Institution 
upon that occasion. It is only necessary to add here that the exhibit 
proved exceedingly attractive to the visitors, as evidenced by the 
crowding of the space from the opening to the closing day, and by the 
numerous favorable notices published in the newspapers and periodi- 
cals of the country. 

A considerable number of the staff of the Institution served as 
judges of award in connection with the several scientific juries of the 
Exposition. 

The Exposition closed on October 31, and the reshipment of the 
exhibits to Washington was immediately commenced. 

At the close of the Exposition several interesting- collections were 
presented to the Institution by foreign Goverumeuts and by individuals 
which it has been difficult to provide room for. 

In this connection I desire to call especial attention to the regret- 
table fact that many exhibits that might have been secured f(n' the 
National Museuu), without expense to the Government, went elsewhere, 
as no provision could be made here for their exhibition in the already 
overcrowded condition of the Museum building. 

Beh'fjates to universities and learned .societies. — The Smithsonian Insti- 
tution is not infrequently invited to send representatives to special 
celebrations instituted by learned societies or universities witli which 
it is in correspondence, both in this country and abroad. Whenever 
practicable, special delegates have been designated by the Secretary to 
represent the Institution on such occasions. 

Dr. Paul Ilaupt, of Johns Hopkins University and curator of oriental 
antiquities in the National Museum, was ap[)ointed as Smithsonian 
representative at the Tenth International Congress of Orientalists to 
be held in Geneva, September 3 to 12, 1894. 

Woodcuts, etc. — A room on the third floor of the Smithsonian build- 
ing has been set ai^art for the storage of several thousand original 
woodcuts, copperplates, and photo engraved blocks used in illustration 
of the publications of the Institution and National Museum. These 
blocks, which have now been marked and catalogued and arranged for 
ready reference, are frequently asked for by publishers, and it has been 
the policy of the Institution to allow their use for reproduction and 
publication at the mere cost of electrotyping. 

The expense of handling and storage of the collection of stereotype 
plates of the different series of publications has become so great, and 
tlie plates are so rarely called for, that it has been determined to dis- 
continue the j)rej)aration of the plates except when their future use can 
be distinctly foreseen. From past experience it is thought that the 
saving of the original cost of electrotyping will more than meet the 
expense of reproducing any papers for which the future may bring 
special demands. 



20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

Archives. — A room on the fourth floor, about 20 by 22 feet, iii the 
east win^ of the Smithsonian building, has been specially fitted up for 
the arrangement of the valuable and somewhat voluminous archives of 
the Institution, in a form where they can be most readily consulted. 
Twenty-nine cases of shelves and sets of drawers are already largely 
tilled with volumes of letters received and press copies of letters sent, 
with indexes, drawings, diagrams, photographs, and plans of the build- 
ings and grounds, original records of proceediugs of the Board of 
Kegents, a full set of the publications of the Institution, copies of 
original papers by the Secretaries of the Institution, etc., and space 
has been provided for the anticipated wants of several years to come. 

Considerable progress has been made in the classification and index- 
ing of these papers under the new arrangement. 

Assignment of rooms. — A room in the basement of the east wing, 
which has been specially fitted up with piers for pendulum experi- 
ments, and connected by telegraph, through the Western Union Tele- 
graph Company's oflice, with the United States IsTaval Observatory, is 
still reserved for the occasional use of the officers of the United States 
Coast and Geodetic Survey. 

Toner lecture fund. — In 1872 Dr. J. M. Toner, of Washington, con- 
veyed about $3,000 in real and personal proi)erty to five trustees, con- 
sisting of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the Surgeon- 
General of the United States Army, the Surgeon-General of the Navy, 
the president of the Medical Society of the District of Columbia, insti- 
tuting thereby "The Toner lecture fund." Ninety per cent of the inter- 
est of the fund is to be applied for at least two annual memoirs or essays 
by different individuals relative to some branch of medical science, to 
be read in the city of W^ashington, under the name of "The Toner lec- 
tures, each of these memoirs or lectures to contain some new truth fully 
established by experiment or observation." 

As these lectures are intended to increase and diffuse knowledge, 
several of them have been accepted for publication in the Smithsonian 
Miscellaneous Collections. The first of the course was by Dr. J. J. 
Woodward, "On the structure of cancerous tumors," and was printed 
in 1873. Nine other lectures, by Dr. C. E. Brown-Sequard, Dr. J. M.

The Hamilton fund. — In 1874 the Institution received $1,000 from the 
estate of James Hamilton, esq., of Carlisle, Pa., bequeathed in the fol- 
lowing clause of his will : 

I give $1,000 to the Board of Eegents ot the Smithsonian Institution, 
located at Washington, D. C, to be invested by said Kegents in some 
safe fund, and the interest to be appropriated biennially by the secre- 
taries, either in money or a medal, for such contribution, paper, or lec- 
ture on any scientific or useful subject, as said secretaries may approve, 



Report op the secretary. 21 

Under resolution of the Regents the bequest was deposited in the 
Treasury on the same terms as the original Smithsonian bequest. In 
administering the trust the income has thus far been only partially used, 
but alh»wed to accumulate, the annual interest not being yet sufficient 
to bear the expense attendant on the designing and striking of a proper 
medal. 

Statue of Secretary Baird. — In my report for 1893 I called attention 
to a bill introduced in the Senate by Mr. Morrill to provide for the 
erection of a bionze statue of Professor Baird in the grounds of the 
Institution. The failure of the passage of this bill was a disappoint- 
ment to the friends of the Institution, and I sincerely hope that Con- 
gress may consent to make an appropriation suitable for such a 
memorial. 

American Historical Association. — The manuscrii)t of the annual 
report of the American Historical Association for the year 1893 was 
transmitted to Congress on March 3, 1894. This is the fifth annual 
report and consistschiefly of papers read at the Historical Congress at 
Chicago in July, 1893. The association has no official relation to the 
Institution further than that its annual reports are transmitted to Con- 
gress through the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, as required 
by its incor])oration act. The reports are Congressional documents, and 
the Institution has no control of their distribution. The association 
prints a special edition of the reports at its own expense and distributes 
them to the State historical societies and to a number of foreign insti- 
tutions and libraries. Under authority granted by Congress in the act 
approved January 4, 1889, a storage room has been assigned in the 
National Museum for the publications of the association, and in the fire- 
proof vaults of the Institution the association has temporarily deposited 
a valuable collection of manuscript records pertaining to the early 
history of the telegraph. 

THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

In previous reports I have felt called upon to insist upon three things 
in regard to the Museum: First, that the collections are increasing so 
rapidly that unless additional space is provided for their proper admin- 
istration and exhibition its efficiency will be greatly impaired ; secondly, 
that the collections, although growing rapidly in certain directions, 
are not increasing as symmetrically and consistently as is manifestly 
desirable. 

The third point which I desire to emphasize, and to introduce before 
the others, has reference to the most undesirable and dangerous neces- 
sity of storing collections, which can not, for lack of space, be placed 
on exhibition, in the wooden sheds south of the Smithsonian building 
and in the basement of the building itself. The storage sheds them- 



22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

selves are merely temporary structures, neither fireproof nor entirely 
safe in other particulars, and tliese are not only so crowded that they 
can hold no more, but their use has thus been perverted from tlie pur- 
poses for which they were built, i. e., for temporary workshops, and as 
packing- and unpacking rooms. So great, liov>^ever, has been the neces- 
sity of economizing all available space, and of finding some x>lace for 
the storage of specimens preserved in dilute alcohol, that the ^Museum 
has been comx)elled to use the sheds for intlaminable material for which 
there is no room elsewhere. In the basement of the building itself 
are large alcoholic collections in bottles containing, in the bulk, many 
thousands of gallons of alcohol. These last specimens are not on exhi- 
bition, but for want of space are stored immediately under the large 
exhibition halls of the Smithsonian building. 

I have the assurance of experts that a fire communicated to these 
rooms would sweep through the entire length of the building, and 
although the buihling itself is fireproof as against any ordinary dan- 
ger, it may well be doubted whether any of the collections therein 
exhibited can be regarded as safe, if the rooms immediately below 
should be exposed to so peculiarly severe a confiagration as would be 
caused by the ignition of these large quantities of iufiammable material. 
Besides this, these wooden slieds, which (as I have already intimated) 
are used not only for storerooms, but for workshops, for the preserva- 
tion of specimens, and also as sheds for the carpenters, are likewise 
liable to cause serious losses, should a tire be kindled in any of them, 
and all of tliese, I repeat, are immediately under the windows of the 
Smithsonian building. 

In a report recently submitted by one of the ins])ectors of the Asso- 
ciation of Fire Underwriters, in response to a request from me for a 
statement as to what insurance rates would be fixed upon the sheds in 
question, the Smithsonian building is referred to as an undesirable 
risk, owing solely to the presence of all this inflammable material 
underneath and in the adjoining sheds, on which latter insurance can 
not be placed for less than $40 per $1,000. This is, I am informed, 
nearly ten times the rate which would be charged on an ordinary ware- 
house. The chief danger, however, is not to the sheds themselves or 
their contents, but to the adjoining collections which, without refer- 
ence to their scientific interest but merely to their intrinsic value, repre- 
sent a very large sum of money. 

I repeat that this condition of affairs is one which urgently demands 
immediate relief, and with this unreserved expression of luy opinion it 
seems to me that I have said all that I can. 

Apart from the dangers incurred by the storage of inflammable 
material in and adjoining the Smithsonian building, the Museum is 
still confronted with the problem of caring for the numerous collections 
which can not be now exhibited, and which, as I have shown, are at 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23 

the present time massed together iu sheds and basements. During 
the past year the disadvantages to the Museum, which have grown 
out of this state of affairs, have beeu esi^ecially apparent. Very many 
valuable collections which were brought to Chicago by foreign govern- 
meuts for exhibition at the Woild's Fair would have been offered to 
the ISTational Museum had not the fact been so generally known that 
they could not be properly accommodated in Washington. The few 
collections which were aciquired by the Museum at the close of the 
Exposition, though not of very great bulk, were exceedingly valu- 
able, but it must be said that the care of even these has largely 
increased the congestion and has been the cause of considerable 
additional embarrassment. I may add that everything that it is pos- 
sible to do has already been done in the way of rearranging the collec- 
tions, with a view to economizing space, and of withdrawing from the 
exhibition series objects which could best be spared from the halls. 

I now recur to the other topics of importance connected with the 
Museum. 

The Museum in its present condition is by no means advantageously 
arranged, with regard either to the general interests of the Institution 
or to its own importance, owing in part to the fact that some of the col- 
lections, under theiiressure of overcrowded conditions, now occupy halls 
which were intended for quite other jiurposes, such as the so called 
"Chapel" in the Smithsonian building, or which are unsuitable for the 
exhibition of specimens, as is indeed the whole of the lower hall in the 
Smithsonian building. Still more unfortunate is it that it is impossi- 
ble to install different departments iu halls by themselves. In the 
Museum building, in many instances, widely distinct collections are of 
necessity exhibited in the same hall, and an appearance of confusion 
and lack of system, which is much to be deprecated, results. 

There is i)robably no museum iu the world iu which so small a pro- 
portion of the objects worthy of exhibition are visible to the public, 
and in which the objects exhibited are crowded together so closely. 
This crowding, indeed, has of necessity been carried to such an extent 
in many of the halls that there is no space to pass between the cases, 
except along a few principal aisles, and the storage rooms already 
contain, mounted and labeled for exhibition, enough material to fill 
several halls niore. It is no exaggeration to say that if there were 
another building as large as the present one it could within a very 
slKU^t time be filled with specimens already here, and that the two 
buildings together would seem as fully occupied as do now the buildings 
of most other museums, 

I earnestly call attention to the proper inference from these state- 
ments, which is, not that one ])uilding can be made, or is being made, 
to do the work of two, but that the one building in questiou is almost 
ceasing to fulfill its proper function, and tends more and more to the 
ponditiou of a warehouse, to the detriment of its proper museum uses, 



24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

In order to relieve in some slight degree this increasing crowding of 
of the halls, I have for some years asked for an appropriation for the 
erection of galleries in two or more of the halls in the Museum build- 
ing. Such galleries were provided for in the original plan of the 
building, and they may be supported in such a manner as not to detract 
from the appearance of the halls or to interfere with tlie installation of 
the collections. They would afford very material relief in the matter of 
exhibition and indirectly in that of storage. 

There has been but little effort to increase the bulk of the collections 
although, as in previous years, no opportunity has been spared to 
increase the completeness and scientific value of the series in several 
departments by the addition of special desiderata. Notwithstanding 
this fact, the increment from legitimate sources, especially from the 
various Departments of the Government, which are required by law to 
deposit their accumulations here, has been more than 171,000 specimens. 
This total, although double that of the previous year, was far below 
that for 1892, when 200,000 specimens were added to the collections, 
and not very much greater than that for 1891. The falling off in 1893 
was due to the fact that the entire activities of the Museum stafl" were 
devoted to preparations for the World's Fair, and that a large number 
of the correspondents of the lustitution, as well as other persons to 
whom the annual increase is ordinarily due, were also occupied in the 
same way. A certain proportion of the accessions in 1891 were acquired 
at the close of the World's Fair iu Chicago. These were almost with- 
out excei)tion collections which had been prepared by foreign exhib- 
itors with the Smithsonian Institution in mind as the ultimate place of 
deposit, and which were sent here at the close of the exposition. 

It would have been possible to have obtained an immense number 
of specimens on this occasion, but it was deemed i)roper to refrain from 
efforts in this direction, not only because of the considerations just 
referred to, but also on account of the desire of the people of Chicago 
to retain such objects in their own city as a beginning toward a great 
civic museum which might serve as a permanent memorial of the 
World's Columbian Exposition. It has always been the policy of the 
Smithsonian lustitution to encourage the development of such institu- 
tions throughout the United States, and to assist in developing them, 
and on this account many proffers of specimens were declined, with the 
recommendation that they be offered to the Chicago Museum, and so 
far as it was possible to do so, the attention of exhibitors who had col- 
lections to dispose of, was directed toward that institution. 

A careful approximation of the number of specimens now contained 
in the various departments of the Museum shows that the total is about 
three and one-quarter millions, almost all of which have been acquired 
by gift, in exchange for other specimens, or as an equivalent for i)ubli- 
cations. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25 

Notwithstanding the unsymraetrical growth of the Museum, to whicli 
I Lave ah^eady alhided, there are some very encouraging features in 
connection with the increase of the collections. Every day numerous 
specimens are contributed by persons who have either visited the 
Museum and wish to testify their sympathy with its work, or have 
become interested through its publications or by correspondence. 

Not a few collections of great value have been given at various times, 
such as the George Oatlin Indian Gallery, the Lea Collection of Min- 
erals and Shells, the Bendire and Ralph Colle(!tions of Birds' Eggs, 
the Lacoe Collection of Fossil Plants, and the Collection of the Ameri- 
can Institute of Miinng Engineers, which latter was transferred at the 
close of the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition. 

Since the accessions are almost entirely gifts, it is manifestly impos- 
sible that the Museum collections should grow symmetrically. A large 
proportion of the annual accessions are not sufficiently valuable to be 
added to either the study or exhibition series. They are all useful, 
however, in connection with the preparation of duplicate sets for dis- 
tribution to educational institutions. The distribution of duplicate 
material has been continued, and more than twenty- seven thousand 
si)ecimens, consisting principally of marine invertebrates, rocks, 
minerals, fishes, and casts of prehistoric implements, have been trans- 
mitted during the year to other museums, colleges, and normal schools. 

The report of the Assistant Secretary, in charge of the National 
Museum, contains a list by groups of the material distributed, as well 
as a geographical statement of the institutions supplied. The same 
report also includes a list of the distributions of material made during 
the last thirty-five years. 

I have found it quite impossible to comply with all the applications 
for specimens from universities, colleges, and other museums; nor can 
tbis be done until Congress shall appropriate a sum of money sufficient 
to render ])ossible the employment of comi)etent persons M^ho, under 
the supervision of the curators, can devote their time to separating 
the duplicates in the various collections, and arranging them into sets 
for distribution. 

I may assume that it is the intention of Congress that the National 
Museum of the United States shall be', so far as a museum can be, a 
worthy exponent of the natural resources and scientific achievements 
of the nation; that it shall be worthy the attention of visitors to the 
capital; that it shall perform its proper functions as one of the scien- 
tific departments of the Government, and shall also promote the 
scientific and educational interests of the country at large. 

It seems worthy of note, then, that while in almost all the largest 
cities of Europe, including London, Paris, Berlin, St. Petersburg, 
Vienna, and Florence, the national collections are exhibited in groups 
of buildings, here m Washington all similar collections are brought 
tog^ether under the roofs of the Smithsonian aud. National Museum 



26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

buildings and the Army Medical Museum building. The practice 
whicli has so largely obtained abroad in this respect is for many rea- 
sons unfortunate, since much labor is duplicated and collections of 
similar character are fouud growing up in different parts of the same 
city. It has, however, its advantages, for where the national collec 
tions are exhibited in a group of museums, each would have its own 
space, and there would be employed in each building a staff as large 
as that which is here concerned in the administration of the whole. 

The National IMuseuni will surely in time at least equal in size and 
importauce the museums of similar character in any of the national 
capitals in Europe. Now is the time for obtaining many kinds of 
objects such as it will be impossible to obtain after the country has 
become more thoroughly settled, when its natural features and its large 
animals will have been destroyed, and its aboriginal inhabitants 
deprived of their race characteristics. The time is rapidly approach- 
ing when many desirable objects can no longer be obtained, audit is a 
matter of deep regret that valuable collections are being constantly 
exported to the Old World museums, which are able to pay for them 
prices absolutely beyond the reach of any American institution, and I 
repeat my statement of the regrettable fact that not oidy the American 
student must leave America to study some important branches of the 
history of native American races, but that the national collections are 
relatively falling still further backward in this regard, as compared with 
those of many other nations. 

It is not advisable, therefore, to check the current of accessions, for 
each year a very Lirge number of objects are procured without cost, 
which in a few years can not be secured at any price. 

The fact that the Museum is embarrassed for lack of space and for 
lack of means to secure a more symmetrical development of the collec- 
tions, renders it all the more necessary thai an efticieut staff of curators 
should be constantly at work, in order to preserve tiie material already 
here and that which is constantly coming in — this, indeed, being their 
first duty. It is also desirable that they should continue, by scientific 
study and by publication, to develop the facts which are essential to 
the correct iiuderstanding of the material, and that the collections 
should be arranged and classified in snch a manner as to be immedi- 
ately accessible to the students of science from all parts of the country 
and from abroad, who are constantly visiting Washington for the 
purpose of consulting these collections iti connection with their own 
scientific studies. 

The scientific staff is, in my judgment, as effective a one as can possi- 
bly be exi^ected under its present condition. It is unfortunate, how- 
ever, that so many of the men in charge of the de])artments should 
be volunteers, without comix'usation, a system whicli is found advan- 
tageous to a limited extent only. With only this aid from specialists, 
not even connected with the Museum, it is imposible for the curators 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 27 

and tbeir assistants to i)erform the urgent work of tlieir departments. 
In a degree, this is attributable to the growing frequency of the demand 
of educational institutions and the outside public upon the staff" for 
iniorination and aid. For tlie safe-keeping of the collections, whose 
increase in value hasrenderedtheresponsibility of custody much greater, 
the force of watchmen should also be increased, while to insure proper 
cleanliness of the floors and cases, a larger number of laborers and clean- 
ers should be employed thau is possible with the appropriation of the pres- 
ent year. It is hoped, then, that the appropriation for the preservation- 
of collections may be restored to at least the amount at which it stood 
when the reduction was made in 1893; though even this sum, as I 
have attempted to show in my letters year by year accompanying the 
estimates, is far below what is needed for efficient work. 

It is also hoped that the appropriation for furniture and fixtures, 
which has been considerably decreased of late years, may be made 
larger, since the crowding of the exhibition halls renders it necessary 
to reconstruct many old cases and to build new ones in places hitherto 
unoccupied, because they have been thought hardly suitable for exhi- 
bition, but to the use of which the administration is now driven. 

It should be borne in mind also that there is constant expense for the 
repair and renovation of the cases already on hand, which yearly suf- 
fer considerable damage from the throngs of visitors. The necessity 
for repair and renovation of the building is yearly becoming greater 
as it grows older, and there being no special provision to meet such 
expense, its cost is of necessity, and by direction of the Treasury author- 
ities, paid from the appropriation for " cases, furniture, fixtures, and 
appliances required for the exhibition and safe-keeping of the collec- 
tions." 

The necessity of a more liberal allowance by Congress for printing the 
publications of the Museum still increases. The editions are far too 
small to admit of placing complete sets in the libraries of each college, 
university, scientific school, normal school, and scientific society in the 
United States — which I deem of the highest importance — as well as 
in every State library, and every local library of importance, as indi- 
cated upon the i^rovisional list which was published as Appendix D in 
the report of the assistant secretary for 1880. In addition to these 
institutions it is desired to send our publications to every national 
library abroad, as well as to every great library, university, or academy 
of sciences which has a center of scientific activity. In return for 
the publications distributed to foreign libraries there is obtained in 
exchange for the Museum library a large number of scientific publica- 
tions of the greatest value, many of which it is impossible to buy, and 
which, if purchasable, would require annually a large expenditure of 
money. On account of the present small editions, the Museum is 
nnfortunately unable to send sets to many scientific institutions from 
which it might otherwise obtain many valuable publications for its 
library. 



28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

Notwithstanding tliese serious drawbacks, the publications of tlie 
Museum (Proceedings and Bulletin) are distributed to about 2,200 
libraries at home and abroad, and more than twice this uumber receive 
the annual report. Specialists are previously supplied with the papers 
emanating from the Museum in the form of extras whi(;h pertain to 
their special studies; and on the mailing lists of the Museum are 
probably not less than 3,000 names of persons thus supplied. It is 
believed, however, that in order to comply with all applications, editions 
twice as large as at present would be necessary. 

The reprinting of some of the earlier volumes of the proceedings 
and bulletins is also much to be desired. This would enable the 
Museum to complete the sets of its publications in libraries which have 
been only partially supplied. The first four volumes of the proceed- 
ings and the first sixteen bulletins were reprinted by the Smithsonian 
Institution iu the Miscellaneous Collections, and in this form only 
libraries were supplied. But it eventually became necessary to cease 
this method of enlargnig the editions, owing to the drain which it 
made on the fund of the Smithsonian Institution. 

Many libraries, therefore, which were supplied with the volumes thus 
reprinted have received none subsequently, and their desiderata are 
being carefully noted with a view to supplying them from new editions, 
if Congress will appropriate the money necessary to defray the cost of 
reprinting. It is also to be hoped that Congress will see fit to restore 
the former extent of the edition of the annual report. The Museum, 
having no fund for the purchase of specimens, relies upon its reports iu 
a large measure for securing accessions to the collections, and already, 
on account of the decrease iu the edition, it has become necessary to 
restrict the mailing list of individuals to those who have done the 
Museum some actual service. This restrictive policy will undoubtedly 
result in an increased demand for these volumes on members of the 
Congressional bodies, for whose personal use a large proportion of the 
edition is reserved. 

During the past year the Museum has received much valuable assist- 
ance and many courtesies at the hands of the Executive Departments 
and Bureaus of the Government, for which acknowledgments are hereby 
tendered. Several officers of the United States Geological Survey, the 
Department of Agriculture, and the Fish Commission have served, as 
in previous years, in the capacity of honorary curators of the collections. 

BUREAU* OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY. 

The work of investigating the languages, habits, customs, and classi- 
fication of the North American Indians was commenced in 1872 at the 
request of Gen. F. A. Walker, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, who 
had called upon the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution for advice 
as to some scientific method of grouping the Indians on their reserva- 
tions. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29 

The Institution was at that time in iiossession of a large collection of 
vocabularies and manuscripts, as yet unpublished, which were placed 
in the hands of Maj. J. W, Powell, who had been previously studying 
the tribes of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and jSTew Mexico, and who had 
himself collected many vocabularies, and he was requested to report 
upon their availability for the purpose in question. Major Powell made 
a report upon these, showing to what extent they would bear upon the 
subject and what was necessary to complete the work. Soon after, the 
task was put in his charge, and it has been in progress since that time. 

In carrying on this work it was essential that all the languages of the 
United States should be studied. It was not known at that time how 
numerous these langnages were, but since then a large number of vocab- 
ularies have been collected in addition to those previously obtained. It 
has been found by Major Powell that these vocabularies may be 
grouped into about sixty classes, each representing a distinct family of 
languages. 

The linguistic investigation has always had for its object to group 
the Indians by their aflinities or their languages, and to determine what 
tribes may be thrown together oji reservations. This linguistic study 
has been continued to the present time, and constantly, mouth by 
month, and year by year. Major Powell has been in communication with 
the Indian OflQce, furnishing the facts necessary to group Indian tribes 
upon reservations. 

At the request of Major Powell an appropriation of $20,000 was made 
for this work in 1870. The work previously done, including the collec- 
tion of vocabidaries, was without expense, by missionaries, teachers, 
and Army officers, and various students of American ethnology have 
been employed without remuneration. 

When this new ap;- opriation was made, it was further asked that the 
scope of the research be enlarged so as to embrace the habits and cus- 
toms of the Indians, and especially their methods of tribal organiza- 
tion and government, and the system of tribal laws in vogue among 
the tribes. With that understanding the appropriation was made, 
and it was soon afterwards somewhat increased, and has remained the 
same amount, about $40,000, except that one year $50,000 was given, 
so that Major Powell might retire from the Geological Survey and 
devote himself exclusively to the Bureau of Ethnology. Circum- 
stances prevented this at the time, but recently he has severed all con- 
nection with the Geological Survey, and is devoting himself" entirely to 
the ethnological work of the Institution. 

The prosecution of investigations relating to the ethnology of'the 
American Indians has been carried forward during the year in accord- 
ance with law under the effieient control of Maj. J. W. Powell, the 
director, aided by Mr. W J McGee, ethnologist m charge, as executive 
officers. These researches of the Bureau of American Ethnology 
embrace the subjects of ^rchaiology, descriptive ethuologyj sociology, 



30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

pictography aud sigu language, liuguistics, mythology, psychology, 
and bibliography, and the results obtained during the year have 
never been exceeded in value. 

Exploratory work has been carried on in the western part of the 
continent by several parties. The most extended exploration was made 
in connection with an archaiologic survey of portions of New Mexico 
and Arizona, where a i)arty examined the valleys of the Little Colorado 
aud San Juan rivers, as well as Canyon de Chelly and the vicinity of 
San Francisco "wash." In the first-named valley but few relics of 
the aborigines were found, and reason was disclosed for believing that 
this poverty in relics was due to the high velocity of the stream and 
the rnggeduess of its channel and valley bottom, by which irrigation 
was rendered impracticable. Certain ruins of considerable interest 
were, however, located and surveyed. In Canyon de Chelly more than 
60 ruins were examined and ground plans of many of them were made, 
while a large series of photographs were taken. TLe San Juan Valley 
also was found rich in remains of structures of the general type found 
in Canyon de Chelly and elsewhere in the arid southwestern region. 
The relative abundance of ruins, indicating a numerous ancient i)opu- 
lation in Canyon de Chelly and San Juan Valley, is ascribed by 
the arclui'ologist to the facility witli which the respective rivers may 
be controlled for irrigation purposes, and abundant remains of the 
irrigation works were found. 

Another party spent several months in Indian Territory and Okla- 
homa collecting information concerning the habits and customs of the 
Kiowa, Arapahoe, and Cheyenne Indians, as well as material objects 
illustrating their arts and modes of life. This i)arty was provided 
with a graphophone, by means of which a number of aboriginal songs, 
both with and without instrumental accompaniment, were recorded. 
Other collaborators of the Bureau visited the Indians of northern 
Wisconsin and northeastern Minnesota and the Kwapa lieservation in 
Indian Territory, where they were able to collect valuable material 
relating to the habits, customs, social organization, myths, traditions, 
and languages of the aborigines. 

The arclueologic investigations already begun in eastern United 
States were contiiuied in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, Maryland, 
Virginia, central Ohio, and Tennessee. The researches in Delaware 
Valley, in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, are considered by the officers 
of the Bureau as of special interest in tlieir bearing on <iuestions con- 
cerning the arts of the prehistoric peoples of eastern North America, 
while the investigations in Virginia are regarded as throwing useful 
light on the arts of the aborigines at a time more iuuncdiately anterior 
to the white invasion. Several reports on different archwologic sub- 
jects were i)repared for publication during the year. The director 
notes with regret that Prof. W. H. Holmes, who has for some years 
been in charge of this archteologic work, has severed his connection 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31 

Kvith the Bureau iu order to accept an important position in the Field 
Columbian Museum, at Chicago. 

The study of Maya and other Mexican codices and inscriptions has 
been continued during- the year. Some of the ancient inscriptions 
have been deciphered and appear to indicate that the calendar systems 
of the prehistoric people of the Western Hemisphere were elaborate and 
of considerable accuracy. 

One of the lines of work in the Bureau since its institution is the 
systematic arrangement of scattered information relating to the tribal 
names and characteristics of the Indians found on this continent by 
early explorers and travelers, Tliis work, which involves extended 
literary research, together with correspondence and conference with 
travelers, missionaries, and others, has been carried forward during the 
year, and the data collected are arranged on cards, forming' a tribal 
dictionary, which is now quite voluminous. The information relating 
to several tribes is now considered sufticiently complete to warrant 
])ublication, and plans have been formulated in the Bureau for printing 
the work in a series of bulletins. 

Several years ago the Bureau began the task of collecting the rude 
rock inscriptions made by the Indians on bowlders, cliffs, canyon walls, 
and the sides or roofs of caves in many parts of the country. As shown 
iu the earlier published reports, these inscriptions are in some cases 
connected with symbolic or heraldic paintings on skins or other sub- 
stances, and in some degree with the gesture speech or sign language 
so commonly employed among certain Indian tribes. The researches 
have been continued, chiefly by Colonel Mallery, and are now substan- 
tially completed. A monograph on pictography was published during 
the year in the tenth annual report of the Director, while an accom- 
oanying monograph on gesture speech is nearly ready for publication. 
Although the work in sign language is not unique, the information 
brought together is voluminous and exact, and the work is regarded 
as especially interesting and useful to students of primitive modes of 
expression in this and other countries. 

One of the chief lines of research in the Bureau relates to the lan- 
guages of the aborigines. The collection of texts, vocabularies, and 
grammatic material has been continued, and reports on the subject 
have been i^ublished. It is thought that the primitive languages of 
this continent, which are remarkable for number and diversity, give 
unexcelled opi)ortunities for the study of linguistic development, and 
with this view a large body of more or less complete manuscript material 
has been brought together for purposes of comparative study, as well 
as for immediate publication. The linguistic manuscripts are stored in 
fireproof vaults, where they are kept accessible to philologists and 
other students. It is believed that the manuscript and other linguistic 
material in the possession of the Bureau is richer than any other body 
of linguistic records of primitive men. 



32 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

Tlie Aiiierican Indiaus, like other primitive peoples, were largely 
influenced in their modes of life and relations among each other and 
with the white pioneers by their myths and beliefs. During the past 
year, as during preceding years, the collection of typical myths has 
hpen continued, and progress has been made in the discussion and 
arrangement of this material in such manner as to indicate Indian 
modes of thought and the motives by which primitive men are actu- 
ated. Progress has been made in preparing material relating to this 
subject for publication, and several of the reports issued during the 
year relate in greater or less measure to Indian mythology. 

The publication, in the form of a series of bulletins, of a bibliography 
of Indian languages has been continued. This work is made as nearly 
as possible exhaustive, and the basis of classitication is such that 
nearly all the more important literature relating to the American 
Indians is included. Two bulletins on the subject were published dur- 
ing the year, covering respectively the literature peitaining to the 
Indians of the Salishan and Wakashan stocks. 

During the past year publication has kept pace with research in 
the Bureau, and a larger number of pages of ethnologic material have 
been put in type than during any previous year in the history of the 
organization. Two annual reports and four bulletins were distributed, 
while several other reports, monographs, and bulletins were also com 
pleted at the close of the year. Partly by reason of the distribution of 
publications, the accessions of the library through gift or exchange 
have been unusually rich. 

A detailed statement by the director of the Bureau of the work 
accomplished under his direction accompanies this report as Appen- 
dix II. 

THE SMITHSONIAN INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE. 

The Smithsonian Exchange Service was inaugurated nearly half a 
century ago, with the object of carrying out one of the purposes ot the 
founder of the Institution in the diffusion of that knowledge which the 
Institution itself helped to create. 

t?or this ])urpose it established correspondence with learned men all 
over the world, until there is no civilized country or people, however 
remote, ui)on the surface of the planet, so far as is known, where the 
Institution is not thus represented. These correspondents have grown 
in numbers until at the present time those external to tbe country alone 
number nearly 17,000. 

An attempt is made to convey, though imperfectly, in the accompa- 
nying map, an idea of the wide distribution of the Institution's corre- 
spondents. In Western Europe and in the eastern part of the United 
States but a small j)ercentage of the actual numbers can be separately 
shown upon this small scale, and it must therefore be understood the 
map is not to be regarded as strictly statistical. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33 

I (lesiic here, however, to call atteution not so much to the exteusiou 
ot this system of correspondeuce as to the existing relations of the 
Smithsonian Institution and of the I^ational Government to this 
Exchange Service. 

The service was, as I have stated, inaugurated nearly a half century 
since, and at that time, in the absence of pecuniary means other than 
its own little fund, the Institution appealed to the generosity of the 
ocean and other large transportation companies to aid it in its unselfish 
work of diffusing knowledge by carrying, free, cases containing the 
communications between learne dsocieties and others in their respec- 
tive countries. Foreign governments have always recognized the 
peculiar service of the Institution by allowing its exchange cases free 
l)assage through their customs services, and in our own country past 
Secretaries of the Treasury have given special instructions to like effect. 

In later years a most important change in this respect, and one 
whose importance is still increasing, comes from the fact that the facili- 
ties of the Exchange Service of the Institution are now made use of 
by all branches of the Government service, and the cases carried by 
these comi^anies contain chiefly Government publications, such, for 
instance, as the Congressional Ilecord and others. 

I again call attention to the fact that, though transportation charges 
are now paid over many lines, it is only through the continuance of this 
peculiar privilege of free freight over other lines, granted originally in 
view of quite other conditions ^ that it is possible for the Institution to 
continue the transportation of these documents under the present 
appropriations, and efficiency and promptness can not be demanded of 
the unpaid service upon which the Institution relies. It has happened, 
for instance, that exchange boxes have been delayed seven months at 
the seaport awaiting a convenient opportunity of shipment. 

Congress has never made appropriations sufficient to meet the entire 
expense of the exchange as conducted under the above partly gratuitous 
ocean service, even in taking into account the repayment to the Insti- 
tution of money advanced to certain Government bureaus for the dis- 
tribution of their exchanges and the amounts received from other 
bureaus under the ruling of the Kegents referred to. An examination 
of the records shows that the Institution has in past years expended 
of its own fund over $38,000 in the transportation of Congressional 
documents alone.^ 

The ofiQce has been laboring under the disadvantage of reduced appro- 
priations, and it has been necessary to curtail expenses in every direc- 
tion. Toward the close of the year, a deficiency estimate having failed 
to receive favorable action, it became necessary to restrict greatly the 
shipments and to notify many correspondents that transmissions would 

'Tbe exchange of Government documents is about 70 per cent of the entire 
exchange work.

34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

be delayed. A great number of packages for shipment have therefore 
accumuhxted at the end of June, including about 7,000 copies of Con- 
gressional documents, and the work has fallen in arrears in other 
respects in spite of the special exertions of an insufficient clerical force 
to keep it up to date. The funds available for the exchange service 
have been also reduced througli the inability of some of the Govern- 
ment bureaus to meet their proportionate share of the expenses involved 
in the transmission of their documents abroad. 

Referring to the report of the curator in charge of the exchange 
office, it will be seen that over 100 tons of books passed through the 
exchange oflice daring the fiscal year 1893-94. 

The disbursements for the year were $17,584.89, of which $14,474.58 
were paid from the appropriation of $14,500 by Congress; $1,729.22 
were paid by Government bureaus, and $4:30.73 by institutions, socie- 
ties, and others, leaving a deficiency of 8944.36. 

The amount which was estimated as necessary for the expense of 
the service for the fiscal year 1894-95 was $23,000, a sum which it was 
hoped would render it unnecessary to call upon the different Govern- 
ment bureaus to reimburse the Institution for a part of the expense 
accompanying the transmission of their publications abroad, and would 
also give effect to a second treaty entered into at Brussels, and pro- 
claimed in 1889, for the immediate exchange of parliamentary docu- 
ments between the contracting countries, a treaty which has been 
inoperative on the part of the United States on account of the lack of 
appropriations for the purpose. Congress having appropriated only 
$17,000 as explained elsewhere. 

The Smithsonian Institution, through the International Exchange 
Service, is brought into close contact with all of the most important 
libraries, scientific societies, and institutions of learning in the United 
States, and the valuable services it has rendered to them in procuring 
foreign publications has always been cordially recognized, but to con- 
tinue the service in the condition of efficiency it reached a few years 
ago, and to keep pace with the ever-increasing demands upon it, for 
the transportation of Government documents, a larger appropriation 
is indispensably necessary. 

Many and just complaints of delays in the transmission of exchanges 
have recently been received, and without adequate means for the suj)- 
portof the service, these Government documents as well as others, which 
are reaching the Institution in increasing numbers, must be allowed to 
accumulateuntilevenroomfor their reception and storage will be lacking. 

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PAEK. 

It is now five years since Congress made an appropriation for the 
purchase of land for a national zoological park. In this time the land 
then purchased has greatly increased in value. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35 

Wbeu Congress was asked to appropriate funds for this park it was 
for a simi^ler and larger purpose than that of the present establisliment, 
since it was meant to found it rather in national than in local interests 
and largely in view of the fact that many Korth American animals, 
constituting a part of the national wealth and formerly occupying a 
large portion of its domain, were threatened with speedy extinction. 

The actual extinction of the buffalo, of which herds consisting of 
literally millions of individuals roamed the i^rairies less than a genera- 
tion ago, is a subject of knowledge and comment throughout the world. 
The beaver, the wapiti, the moose, and many other species useful to 
man, which within the memory of those now living had their haunts 
and were found in abundance east of the Mississippi, are each year 
becoming more and more rare. It was urged upon Congress that 
unless steps were speedily taken to preserve the remaining few, and 
to bring them under observation, these races must perish, as other 
extinct species have done, and that with the disappearance of the last 
individual all hoi^e of their renewal would be lost. 

The reservation of the Yellowstone National Park as a great game 
preserve had been a first and very imi^ortant movement toward their 
I)reservatiou, but the very immensity of the reservation threatened to 
defeat the plan, for as regards the rarer animals, these naturally kept 
to the wilder and more remote regions of the park, where they could 
not be i^rotected from the marauding hunter, nor (what is not unimport- 
ant) be observed by the naturalist. To retard their extinction (since 
so long as a single pair exists and bears offspring the. renewal of the 
race in countless individuals is at least possible), and to provide oppor- 
tunity for their careful stndy, was the intention of those who first advo- 
vocated the establishment of a preserve near Washington large enough 
to keep the animals as close to natural conditions as is possible, and 
yet not so large but that they could always be protected and under 
observation. 

The Smithsonian Institution had for some years received frequent 
gifts of animals, bat no suitable accommodations existed, and it seemed 
desirable that some provision should be made for the numerous speci- 
mens which came by donations or from Government reservations, and 
which were of necessity killed for scientific study or given away to 
zoological gardens in other cities. 

Tlie act of Congress making provision for a park, entailed responsi- 
bilities of a different character from those first contemplated, for instead 
of creating a purely national institution for a national ])urpose, one-half 
of the cost of purchase and maintenance was placed upon the tax- 
payers of the District. The indirect but quite evident tendency of 
this local taxation was to divert a large share of the appropriation to 
meet the demands of the local taxpayer, and the Eegents of the Smith- 
sonian, under whom the park was placed, were directed to " administer 
the park for the advancement of science and the insti'uction and 
recreation of the people." 



36 REPORT CF THE SECRETARY. 

When the land was bought it was thought desirable to include as 
great a length of Eock Creek as possible with sufficient width of 
ground to attord large, retired paddocks. 

The park has an area of nearly 107 acres, with an ample supply of 
water for lakes, i^onds, and inclosures, while the varied and picturesque 
character of tlie banks of the cieek attbrds a variety of exposure and 
of ett'ect delightful to all lovers of* natural landscape. 

There are as yet but four perinaneut buildings and the animals num- 
ber 510, of which 200 are of the larger size. 

Comparing this with similar establishments at other capitals, it may 
be noted that the Gardens of the Zoological Society, in Regent's 
Park, London, established about 68 years ago, cover about 36 acres of 
mere open common, crowded with buildings, and that the magnificent 
collection of animals, some 2,300 in number, is housed in a fairly com- 
fortable manner. 

In Paris the portion of the Jardin des Plantes assigned to animals 
is a plat of ground some 17 acres in extent, laid out tastefully, with 
all the resources of the landscape gardener, but necessarily crowded 
with its 900 animals. 

In Berlin the portion of the Thiergarten appropriated for animals 
occupies about 60 acres. The buildings are ornamental and substantial. 
Fifteen hundred animals are accommodated and, necessarily, much 
overcrowded. The landscai^e features are almost wholly subordinated. 

In the United States the pinncipal collections are in Philadelphia, 
where the grounds occupy about 40 acres and the collection comprises 
881 animals; in Cincinnati, where 36 acres are occupied with about 800 
animals ; and in ISTew York, where the city maintains about 700 animals 
in Central Park, occupying an area of approximately 10 acres. In none 
of these collections are the grounds of sufficient size to give any exten- 
sive range for the animals. 

The accompanying diagram shows the size of the ^National Zoological 
Park compared with those of London, Paris, and Berlin. 

I ought not to close these remarks Avithout calling attention to the 
evidence of the use of these gardens by the public. Even in their 
present inchoate condition they have received as many as 30,000 visit- 
itors in a single day. The ground constitutes a park so adjacent to 
the city as to be accessible on foot to all, and an expression which has 
been used elsewhere may be applied with no less justness here in 
describing this park as the lungs of the city. 

The natural advantages possessed by the IS'ational Zoological Park 
are unrivaled. I am not aware that any city has a zoological park of 
such extent, so picturesquely situated, and so easily accessible. It 
is possible here to provide almost any exposure which animals may 
require, to give them large paddocks with abundant sliade and seclu- 
sion, or to furnish for waterfowl and other aquatic animals lakes, ponds, 
and long reaches of water, where they can live in almost perfect natu- 




AREAS OF ZOOLOGICAL PARKS. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 37 

ral conditions. These desiderata for the animals may be combined with 
landscape eti'ects; with stretches of meadow and wooded hillsides, 
with overhaugiug- cliits and running- water, with dense shade and sunny 
slopes; such as can not fail to prove a lasting advantage and pleasure 
to the public. 

It is obvious that care should be taken to develop this park along 
the lines which the natural conditions so clearly indicate, and that it 
would be a mistake to nuir its beauty by huddling the buildings together, 
and by crowding the animals into small and uncomfortable quarters. 

Having always in mind that the original object of the park was the 
preservation of American animals, it is intended to make that a princi- 
pal matter of consideration ; yet it must be remembered that even in 
the interest of North American zoology, comparative studies can not 
be properly carried on without a certain proportion of animals belong- 
ing to the Old World. It is to be exjiected, therefore, that a certain 
number of foreign animals will be included in the collection when they 
can be advantageously obtained. 

The Yellowstone National Park has always been regarded as an 
important x>reserve, from which supplies could be drawn for the 
National Zoological Park. Its distance and the cost of transportation 
have prevented its use to so great an extent as could be wished; 
yet there have been received from it during the year a total of 28 
animals, among which were a flue herd of young elk. In order to 
properly utilize the resources of the Yellowstone Park, it will probably 
be necessary to construct there a corral of considerable extent, into 
which wild animals can be driven, inclosed, fed, and, at the proper 
time, secured for shipment. Projects for a structure of this kind have 
been considered, but the lack of funds has thus fVir prevented their 
accomplishment. 

It seems necessary to again refer to the desirability of changing the 
appropriation act so as to permit the occasional purchase of animals. 
Several times during the past year rare native animals have been offered 
for sale at extremely low prices— indeed, for less than the cost of trans- 
portation from the regions where they were obtained. Among such 
are the Eocky Mountain Goat and the Mountain Sheep. This goat has 
never before been seen in captivity, as far as I am aware, and the 
sheep is extremely rare. 

In October, 1893, the proprietor of the large menagerie which in 1890 
presented the park with an elephant, offered to make a temporary deposit 
of a number of animals without charge. In consideration of the words 
of the fundamental act, "For the instruction and recreation of the 
people," it was decided to accept the offer, such arrangements being 
customary in zoological gardens. It was stipulated that any animals 
born should become the property of the United States. The experiment 
was satisfactory, affording to the public an opportunity of seeing and 
studying at leisure, a number of interesting specimens, such as the park 
could not hope to possess for many years to come. 



38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

The appropriation made for tlie park for the fiscal year ending June 
30, 1894, was in the following terms: 

For continniiig- the construction of roads, walks, bridges, water sup- 
ply, sewerage and drainage, and for grading, i)lanting, and otherwise 
improving the grouuds, erecting and rejiairiug buildings and inclosures 
for the animals, and for administrative purposes, care, subsistence, and 
transportation of animals, including salaries and compensation of all 
necessary employees, and general incidental expenses not otherwise 
provided for, fifty thousaud dollars, one-half of which sum shall be ])aid 
from the revenues of the District of Columbia and the other half from 
theTrea.sury of the United States; and a report in detail of the expenses 
of the National Zoological Park shall be made to Congress at the begin- 
ning of each regular session. 

By fjxr the greater portion of this appropriation was expended for 
food for the maintenance of the animals, and for keeping in proper care 
and condition the buildings and accessories. The sum remaining, 
being insufficient for new work of any great extent, has been expended 
in necessary improvements, and in building roads and x^aths to the 
different buildings and shelters. 

The bridge near the Quarry-Road entrance has been somewhat 
improved by the addition of footways and copings. This structui-e is, 
however, far from satisfactory, liaving been built from a limited appro- 
priation at a time when it was absolutely necessary to cross the stream 
to reach the central portion of the park. 

Certain questions involving the access of the public to the park, are 
still pending and are connected with the plan of the suburban roads 
now under consideration by the Commissioners of the District of 
Columbia. The street railways are by no means convenient, as the 
Fourteenth street line is over half a mile distant from the park, and the 
Rock Creek Railway, although passing by the western gate of the jiark, 
delivers its passengers at a distance almost as great from the buildings 
where the animals are kept. The plan for the extension of the streets 
of the n)istrict, includes a carriage road outside the park from the 
point where the Adams Mill Road leaves it to Kennesaw Avenue. 
When this is once established the strip of ground between it and 
the park boundary should be purchased and added to the park. 
This will be of advantage in many ways, first, for seclusion by pre- 
venting private property from abutting upon the park and second, as 
making more secure the cliff" in the vicinity of the bear pits, which has 
always been a menace and a serious disadvantage because of its prox- 
imity to the park line, and the impossibility of properly treating it. 

Further steps will probably be soon taken toward establishing 
entrances at the southern end of the park. If this be done it will prob- 
ably be necessary to improve the old Adams Mill Road, and to build 
a second bridge crossing from the promontory where the office now 
stands to the meadow near the animal house. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39 

ASTRO-PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY. 

I am gratified to state that tlie researches conducted here have cou- 
tinued to fulfill the expectations held out iu previous reports. I believe 
that the results attained may be stated to be the most important which 
have ever been reached iu regard to that region of the spectrum of 
which so little is known, and which includes the greater portion of all 
those energies of the sun which, through its heat, affect climate and 
the crops, and are thus related not only to questions of abstract interest 
but to utilities of national importance. The interest aroused by these 
researches among men of science has been very gratifying, and it is 
hoped that it may be found that no money granted by the Government 
for scientific investigation has been more profitably employed than this, 
even iu the restricted j)oint of view of the merely utilitarian advantages 
which may be hoped from it. 

For a more ijarticular account of these recent results I refer to the 
report of the Observatory. 

Mr. R. C. Child was appointed aid in the Observatory on September 
1, 1893, and Mr. F. E. Fowle, jr., as photographer, on June 1, 1894. 
Mr. F. L. O. Wadsworth resigned the position of senior assistant :n 
the Observatory on June 1, 1894. 

Respectfully submitted. 

S. P. Langley, 
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. 



APPENDIX TO THE SECRETARY'S REPORT. 



Appendix I. 
THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Sir: In accortlance with the provision of Congress, the Report of the National 
Miisenm is published as the second voluiue of the Smithsonian Report. I shall here 
refer briefly to only a few of the most important features of the operations of the 
Museum during the j^ear. 

Accessions. — More than 171,000 specimens have been added to the collections. This 
is more than double the total for last year, a gratifying result, m view of the fact 
that very little direct eft'ort was made to increase the collections. 

Important collections have been received, as in past years, from the Geological 
Survey, the Fish Commission, the Bureau of Ethnology, and other Bureaus of the 
Government. Several valuable collections have been received from private sources, 
and some very interesting material was presented by representatives of foreign 
Governments to the National Museum at the close of the World's Columbian 
Exposition. 

The detailed report for the year will contain a statistical statement showing the 
number of specimens added during the year to each department, and for each year 
since the opening of the Museum building. 

The scienUJjc staff. — The scientific staff is substantially the same as last year. A 
few changes and additions have occurred in the cnratovships. Having, as Assistant 
Secretary, resumed the active direction of the afiairs of the Museum, the designation 
of Mr. True was on May 9 changed from Curator-in-charge to Executive Curator, 
with special duties of administration. The Executive Curator may at times be called 
upon to take general charge in my absence. On July 15, Dr. C. H. White, U- S. N., was 
recalled from his custodianship of the materia medica collections by the Secretary of 
the Navy. Dr. C. U. Gravatt was detailed in his place, and served until January 22, 
when he was relieved by Dr. R. A. Marmion, who was succeeded on June 1.5 by Medical 
Inspector Daniel McMurtrie, the present incumbent. Mr. Charles Schuchert, of the 
United States Geological Survey, was on May 7 appointed honorary aid in the Depart- 
ment of Paleozoic Fosils. Dr. C. W. Stiles, of the Department of Agriculture, was 
on March 17 appointed honorary curator of the heliuinthological collections. 

Dr. Frank Baker resigned his position as honorary curator of the Department of 
Comparative Anatomy in order to devote his entire time to his duties as Superin- 
tendent of the National Zoological Park, and Mr. Frederick A. Lucas, assistant 
curator of that department, was on November 21 appointed curator. Dr. Baker is 
now recognized as associate curator. On January 1 Mr. Wirt Tassin was appointed 
assistant curator in the Department of Minerals, filling the vacancy caused by the 
resignation of Mr. William S. Yeates. 

Distribution of specimens. — Following the custom of previous years, the transmission 
of duplicate specimens to educational establishments has been continued, and it is 

41 



42 REPORT OP THE SECRETARY. 

gratifying to note that, in comparison with last year, more than double the number 
of specimens has been thus clistributetl. Of the 27,168 specimens thus disposed of, a 
large proportion represent invertebrate forms of marine life. Several sets of rocks 
and ores, minerals, and casts of prehistoric objects, as well as a few special collec- 
tions of insects, fishes, birds, mollusks, and other material, were included. In addi- 
tion, 1,448 specimens were lent to investigators for special study. 

It has for many years been the intention of the Museum to make up a niiml)cr of 
duplicate sets in all the departments of the Museum, to be used in supplying educa- 
tional institutions. Ai^plications for specimens are received almost every day. 
That valuable service could be rendered to colleges and schools in this way does not 
admit of doubt, but it is impossible to carry out such a plan until the curators can 
be supplied with the services of competent assistants to relieve them of the work of 
sorting out the duiilicates and arranging them into sets for distribution. And this 
can not be arranged until Congress sees fit to make a large increase in the Museum 
appropriation. 

In order to give an idea of the extent to which this branch of the Museum work 
has been carried on, even with the very limited facilities now at hand, it may be 
stated that since 1871 about 370,000 specimens have thus been distributed. 

Visitors. — The total number of visitors to the Smithsonian building during the 
year was 103,910, and to the Museum building 195,748. 

riiblications. — The report of the Museum for 1891 was published during the year, 
and also, in the form of separates, a limited edition of each paper in the appendix. 
The report for 1892 is nearly ready for delivery, and the sei)arate editions of the 
jiapers in the appendix have already been issued. Volumes 15 and 16 of the Pro- 
ceedings have appeared in bound form, and a few papers included in volume 17 have 
been published as separates. Of the Bulletin, the following numbers have been 
published: No. 43, A Monograph of the Bats of North America, by Harrison Allen, 
M. I).; No. 44, Catalogue of the Lepidopterous Superfamily Noctuid;o found in 
Boreal America, by John B. Smith ; No. 45, The Myriapoda of North America, by 
Charles Harvey Bollman; No. 46, Monograjih of the North American Proctotryjiida;, 
by William H. Ashmead. 

Special Bulletin No. 2, Oceanic Ichthyology, by the writer and Tarleton H. Bean, 
is in type. This work constitutes a monograph of the deep-sea and pelagic fishes 
of the world. The material for No. 3 of this series is in course of iire])aration by 
Maj. Charles Bendire. It will be a continuation of the subject of No. 1, Life 
Histories of North American Birds, and will treat of the cuckoos, woodpeckers, 
goat suckers, swifts, humming birds, fiycatchers, horned larks, crows, jays, mag- 
pies, blackbirds, orioles, and grackles. 

I have elsewhere referred to the pressing necessity of an increase in the ai)propria- 
tion for printing. 

Specimens transmitted to the Museum for identification. — During the year 478 lots of 
specimens were received fordetermination. Very little of this material can be advan- 
tageously incorporated with the collections, and therefore the Museum receives but 
little actual gain from this work, which occupies a large proportion of the time of 
several of the curators, notably in the Department of Geology. Requests for exami- 
nation and report are, however, invariably complied with. Quantitative analyses, 
however, can not be undertaken. 

Foreign exchanges. — A number of exchanges have been aff'ected with museums and 
individuals in dilfei'ent parts of the world, and the National Museum has in this 
manner acquired much valuable material. Among the institutions with which 
these transactions have proved most advantageous to the Museum are the Australian 
Museum, Sydney ; Queensland Museum ; Technological Museum of New South Wales ; 
Natioual Museum of Costa Rica; Museumof Natural History, Paris j Imperial Royal 
M^seuiH of Vienna, 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43 

Explorations. — The farther explorations of Dr. William L. Abbott, in Kashmir, 
India, the Seychelles and adjacent islands in tlie Indian Ocean, have resulted in addi- 
tional important collections for the Museum. Several papers describing his collec- 
tions have been published in the Proceedings of the National Museum. 

Prof. O. F. Cook, of Huntington, N. Y., who is now traveling in Liberia, has 
transmitted a large collection of ethnological objects and natural liistorj^ specimens 
from that country. 

The researches in Finland of Hon. John M. Crawford, United States consul-general 
at St. Petersburg, Russia, have resulted in the transmission of a most valuable col- 
lection of ethnological objects. The collection was accompanied by a descriptive 
list, minutely setting forth their nses. 

Mr. J. B. Henderson, jr., of Washington City, and Mr. Charles T. Simpson, of the 
National Museum, during an exploring trijj in the West Indies obtained for the 
Museum a collection of Miocene marl and land shells. 

The Intercontinental Railway Commission has presented to the Museum a large 
collection of natural history specimens, obtained in Central America by Dr. W. C. 
Shannon, IT. S. A. 

Mr. Mark I). Kerr, of New York City, has, in connection with his explorations in 
Ecuador, forwarded an interesting collection of natural history specimens from that 
country. 

A collection of reptiles and fishes, olttained by Dr. Einar Lonnberg, of Upsala.

Appendix II. 

EEPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY 
FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1894. 

Sir: Ethnologic researches have been carried fo^^Yard duriug the year in accord- 
ance with act of Congress making provision "for continuing researches relating to 
the Aniericau Indians, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution.'' 

The i)rimary chisaificatiou of the work is to]iical, and the researches pertaining 
to each subject are divided between field studies and office work as circumstances 
require. The chief lines of activity relate to (1) archaeology, (2) descriptive eth- 
nology, (3) sociology, (4) pictography and sign language, (5) linguistics, (6) myth- 
ology, (7) psychology, and (8) bibliography, together with (9) publication, and the 
ancillary exploratory and miscellaneous work. 

The classification of the work is more definite than the assignment of the person- 
nel, since circumstances from time to time require the concentration of a large part 
of the energies of the Bureau on one or a few subjects, and thus sjjecial assignm(>nts 
are made with advantage to the work and, it is believed, without injury, and indeed 
commonly with benefit, to the workers. 

EXPLORATION. 

The most extended exploratory work of the year was that of Mr. Cosmos Mindelefif 
in connection with archaeologic surveys in the Pueblo country of New Mexico and 
Arizona. He left Washington early in July, 1893, and, outfitting at Holbrook, Ariz., 
proceeded to the Hopi villages of Tusayan, and toward the end of August to the 
valley of the Little Colorado, which he explored in some detail. Contrary to 
expectations this region was found to be poor in relics of the aborigines; only a few 
small and unimportant ruins are scattered over the valley, and the sites were appar- 
ently occupied for short periods only. It is noteworthy, that according to Hopi 
tradition, it was along a valley tributary to the Little Colorado that the large tim- 
bers used in the construction of the Spanish churches and mission buildings prior to 
1680 were transported on the backs of Indians from San Francisco Mountains, nearly 
100 miles away, and that this tradition appears to find corroboration in Mr. Minde- 
]eft''s observation of a party of Tusayan Indians transporting poles from the foot- 
hills of the same mountains over the same route by the use of burros. The reason 
for the dearth of ruins gradually became apparent as the explorations were con- 
tinued; the topography about the Little Colorado and the character of the stream 
itself are such that its waters could not be controlled for purposes of irrigation by 
any means at the command of ancient pueblo builders; even modern engineering 
skill has thus far failed to control the stream, although many eff'orts in this direction 
have been made. 

Only at intervals are there flood plain lands suitable for primitive cultivation 
and within easy reacli of irrigation devices, and in such places ruins are usually found. 
This is notably the case near the old Sunset crossing, where, perched on the hills 
overlooking the flood plain, can be seen the ruius often or more villages, the largest 
of which would have accommodated a population of 200. The ground plan of this 
village shows a number of rectangular rooms, the whole bearing a strong resera- 
blauce to the plan of ruins found near the Tusayan villages. Tradition recites that 
44 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45 

this village (or possibly a ueigliboring one) was called Homalobi, aud was occupied 
by the Water gens, the last to reach Tusayan. The indications are that the period 
of occupancy was short. 

Mr. Mindeletf found the river at Mormon crossing or " the Crossing of the Fathers" 
too high for fording, and his party proceeded with difficulty along the northern 
bank to the old Sunset crossing near Winslow. After fording at this point, the 
party proceeded to Camp Verde, crossing the Mogollon Mountains by way of Sunset 
and Chavez passes. At Camp Verde an old field outfit was taken up and the party 
returned by way of Flagstaff, reaching Little Colorado River at the mouth of San 
Francisco Avash. This region was formerly a favorite hunting ground of the 
Tusayan, large parties leaving the villages to hunt antelope and other game so 
recently as ten years ago; but the game has nearly disappeared, and the annual 
hunting parties of the Tusayan Indians are now but a memory. From San Francisco 
wash the party followed the southern branch of the river to Winslow, and the 
northern side thence to Holbrook. 

LeaA'ing Holbrook early in October, Mr. Mindeleff proceeded northward toward 
Canyon de Clielly. Advantage was taken of the opportunity to examine the local- 
ity of a supposed ruin some 35 miles north of Holbrook, concerning which rumors 
have been current for several years, and the supposed ruin was found to be a nat- 
ural dike rising from the summit of a low hill as a wall of black basalt over 100 
feet long, generally less than 2 feet thick, aud sometimes 18 feet high. Near its 
western end the remains of a habitation consisting of one or two rooms was found, 
the ground being strewn with potsherds. So striking is this dike that the Navajo 
guide in.sisted, even when standing before it, that it is artificial; yet examination 
leaves no doubt as to its real character. C'anyon de Chelly was reached about the 
middle of October, and detailed examination of its cliff" ruins was begun at once and 
continued nearly to the end of December. More than sixty ruins were examined, and 
ground plans of many of them were made and a large series of photographs were 
taken. The results of this survey, which is summarized elsewhere, are of great 
interest. 

Leaving Canyon .de Chelly in December, the j)arty proceeded by way of Pueblo 
Colorado and Fort Defiance, to San Juan River, where it was planned to winter. In 
crossing Tunicha Mountains a. snowstorm of uuiirecedented severity for the season 
was encountered, and the party missed the trail and for a time were lost ; among other 
accidents a wagon was overturned in such manner that Mr. Mindeleff was caught 
beneath it and his slioulder dislocated, whereby he was disabled for some months. 
Fortunately the expedition was rescued by a party of ranchmen from Fort Defi- 
ance, organized for the purpose when the severity of the storm was realized. The 
success of the expedition and even the preservation of the lives of its members must 
be ascribed largely to the humanity which inspired the rescue party and the energy 
with which they pushed into the mountains, rendered almost impassable by the 
snow aud wind. The expedition reached San Juan River a few days later, and soon 
after disbanded. 

When able to resume work Mr. Mindeleff' began a reconnoissance of San Juan 
Valley, not completed at the end of the fiscal year. This district was found rich in 
ruins, mainly of a type resembling the oldest ruins in Canyon de Chelly. San Juan 
Valley is terraced, nnd the river itself is a swift mountain stream, and conditions 
are thus favorable for irrigation by jirimitive as well as civilized men. The detailed 
surveys here were accordingly extended and resulted in substantial contributions to 
the archaeology of southwestern United States. 

Mr. James Mooney spent some months, beginning with July, on the Kiowa Reser- 
vation in Indian Territory, and subsequently visited the Arapahoe and Cheyenne 
Indians for the purpose of collecting information concerning habits and customs as 
well as beliefs and languages. He was provided with a graphophone, by means of 
which he was able to record a number of aboriginal songs, both with and without 



46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

instrumeutal aucoiupauiments, and in single voice effects as well as iu chorus. Alto- 
gether he spent five mouths in field work, of which part was exploratory. 

Col. Garrick Mallery spent the greater part of the mouth of September among the 
Indians of northern Wisconsin and northeastern Minnesota for the purpose of .veri- 
fying and correcting notes obtained through correspondence. 

Dr. W. J. Hoffman spent July and August and a portion of September among the 
Ottawa Indians near Petoskey, Mich., the Ojibwa Indians at La Pointe Reservation, 
Wis., and the Meuomoni Indians at Keshena iu the same State, and among the several 
tribes information pertaining to their customs aud beliefs was obtained. 

Mr. J. Oweu Dorsey spent the mouth of January, 1894, on the Kwapa Reservation 
iu Indian Territory, investigating the social organization of the tribe and recording 
their myths and traditions. 

During the earlier part of the j'ear the Director took advantage of opportunities 
growing out of work in connection with the Geological Survey on the Pacific Coast to 
A'isit several Indian tribes and to continue his researches relating to their habits, 
myths, and languages. 

ARCHEOLOGY. 

Mr. W. H. Holmes was occupied throughout the year in archa'ologic researches, 
chiefly iu eastern United States. The first half of July was spent iu organizing the 
work of the year, aud later he proceeded to ditterent jjoiuts iu Delaware Valley for 
the purpose of continuing studies of ancient quarries and quarry shops. A new 
quarry shop was discovered on Delaware River, 15 miles above Trenton, yielding 
rejects corresponding precisely with the objects so abundantly found iu the gravels 
on which the city of Trenton is built, and which were formerly classed as paleoliths. 
Subsequently he visited a number of interesting localities in Ohio, giving especial 
attention to the gravels at Newcomerstown, in or apparently iu which an artificially 
shaped stone has been found, this being the only case now strougly held to indicate 
the existence of man during the Glacial period in this country. 

In October he visited an island in Potomac River, near Point of Rocks, flooded by 
a recent freshet in such manner as to lay bare an ancient village and aboriginal 
workshop. This workshop proved of considerable interest in that here unmistak- 
able indication was found, for the first time that blocks of stone were used as anvils 
in the production of certain classes of stone implements and weapons. 

During February he directed the exploitation, by Mr. William Dinwiddie, of an 
aboriginal steatite quarry near Clifton, Va. This quarry was found especially 
instructive by reason of its large size, the great number of partly com2)leted uteusils 
found within the opening aud iu the neighboring dump heap, and in the excellence 
of its preservation. 

In April Mr. Holmes, accompanied by Mr. McGee, repaired to an interesting site 
near the mouth of Pass Creek, not far from Luray, Va., for the jiurpose of collect- 
ing additional data relating to a noteworthy series of stone art i)roducts, to which 
attention was called during the preceding fiscal year by Mr. Gerard Fowke. 

A considerable) additional collection Avas made and an aboriginal cemetery was 
discovered iu a neighboring field, aud from it a typical collection of mortuary pot- 
tery was taken. The stone art jiroducts in this locality are of excejitional interest, 
as the "turtleback" forms are rejects from the manufacture of celts. The rejects 
hitherto studied by Mr. Holmes represent, exclusively or iiredominantly, narrow- 
pointed instruments such as spear points or arrow heads, while those found at the 
mouth of Pass Creek represent predominantly the manufacture of broad and thin 
pointed objects. A sufiiciently complete series of rejects aud nearly comjdeted 
forms to illustrate all stages in manufacturing was brought together. 

Mr. McGee extended the observatious from this locality up Pass Creek with the 
purpose of discovering the original source of the stream pebbles aud cobbles used by 
the primitive artisans, aud was rewarded by finding, well toward the head waters 
of the stream, a large mass of intrusive rock, from which the pebbles were originally 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 47 

derived. This part of tlie study also pi'oved of exceptional interest, as it indicated 
the delicacy with which the Indian mantifacturer adjusted himself to his environ- 
ment; in situ the rock is too massive and obdurate for working by primitive meth- 
ods; in the upper reaches of the stream the bowlders derived from parent ledges are 
too large for reduction Avithout the use of metal; below the conilueuce of Pass 
Creek with the Hawksbill the pebbles are too small and too scant for profitable 
working; while just above the confluence, at the site discovered by Mr. Fowke, the 
l)ebbles are at the same time of suitable size and snliticiently abundant for easy 
working by i)rimitive methods — in short, the best and, indeed, the only feasible site 
for the aboriginal factory was that selected for the purpose. The material is a 
peculiarly tough and strong crystalline rock, which flakes fairly well and is at the 
same time adapted to battering and grinding. 

During the flrst three months of the year Mr. Gerard Fowke was occupied, under 
Mr. Holmes'd general instructions but under the immediate direction of the ethnolo- 
gist in charge, in making collections from the little known but highly interesting 
interior shell mounds in the valley of Teimessee River. This work yielded excellent 
results, particularly in the form of material collected for the enrichment of the National 
Museum. The collections were duly cleaned, prepared, and tabulated, and trans- 
ferred to the Museum by Mr. Henry Walther. 

Mr. William Dinwiddle, nnder Mr. Holmes's immediate direction, spent the greater 
part of the months of July, August, and September in archii^ologic reconnoissance 
along the shores and tributaries of Chesapeake Bay with the object of demarking 
more exactly by art products the territory belonging respectively to the diflerent 
peoples. His work also yielded abundant collections for the enrichment of the 
National Museum for the benefit of contemporary and future students. 

During February and March, as already noted, Mr. Dinwiddle was occupied in 
investigating the aboriginal steatite quarry at Clifton, Va. The quarry was 
cleared and its walls and floors were found to yield numerous and characteristic 
traces of primitive workmanship: a rich collection of broken and partially finished 
utensils was made ; a good series of photographs, showing with unprecedented accu- 
racy the details of the quarrying and manufacturing operations, was taken ; a num- 
ber of the tools used in the work were founil, while the entire collection has been 
brought together for study and preservation in the National Museum. The more 
general results of the investigation of this quarry have been incorporated in 
reports by Mr. Holmes, while a detailed paper on the subject is in preparation by Mr. 
Dinwiddle. 

The results of the work by Mr. Cosmos Mindeleft' in New Mexico and Arizona are 
of much importance. The examination of over sixty ruins in Canyon de Chelly veri- 
fies the conclusion previously reached by the same investigator that the clifii" dwell- 
ings here were primarily farming outlooks, and that the home villages were commonly 
located on Avholly indefensible sites on the canyon bottom. It was found that the ruins 
are divisible into several groups, apparently representing a chronologic sequence. In 
the later ruins highly suggestive details are found illustrating the gradual assimila- 
tion of introduced or accultural ideas. Among other results there was obtained a 
series of drawings and photographs showing the development of chimney structure 
from the first crude attempts to imitate a form known only from casual observation 
and description to a more finished structure, though the most finished product was 
far from perfect, while the first attem])ts were exceedingly crude. Mr. Mindeleff 
was led to conclude that the foreign ideas exemplified in the chimneys and otiier 
structures were introduced in the architecture of Canyon de Chelly at a late period 
of the occujiancy of the territory, probably only a few decades before its abandon- 
ment. Other details, such as the constructive use of adobe, were traced through the 
various stages of development in the same way ; and some ruins were found in which 
the old and the new ideas find expression side by side in such manner as to indicate 
that the village was occupied before the introduction of the foreign ideas, and that 
the occupancy continued until after the ideas were definitely crystallized. 



48 REPOET OF THE SECRETARY. 

One interesting group or series of ancient ruins was found, which had apparently 
been oveTlooked by previous visitors. They occur in the upper ])art of the canyon 
and -ire nearly obliterated. The structures were always located on sites deter- 
mined Avholly by agricultural necessity and methods without reference to defensive 
ends. Mr. Mindeleff is of opinion tliat these are the oldest ruins in the canyon 
belonging to the initial period of occupancy, which extended over many decades. 
Close attention was given also to a number of large ruins situated in the canyon 
bottom without reference to defense, also overlooked bj' previous explorers. These 
differ Ironi the preceding type and are in some respects the most important ruins ot 
the canyon. They apparently represent the home pueblos occupied coutemporane- 
ously with the clift" dwellings, and bore the same relation to the latter that Zuni 
bears to Nutria, Pescado, and Ojo Caliente, or that Oraibi bears to Moeu Kopi. The 
clilf dwellings were apparently occupied as a rule only during the summer mouths, 
the occupants resorting to the pueblos during the winter. Thus the cliff dwellings 
appear to reiireseut a phase rather than a chronologic epoch in the history of the 
pueblo builders. 

Although the researches are not yet completed, Mr. Mindelefif is of opinion tbat 
while some of tbe ruins may be precolumbian others were undoubtedly occupied in 
the seventeenth century, and that the occupancy was probal^ly continuous as regards 
the district, though ])robably not continuous as regards particular tribes or sub- 
tribes. A general result of the study was the classilication of the various types of 
ruins, in a chronologic order, in such manner that the history of the canyon from 
the earliest occupancy up to the recent advent of English-speaking settlers is 
clearly indicated. In combining the data acquired in Canyon De Chelly with those 
obtained from Rio Verde during previous years, Mr. Mindeleff finds reason for the 
conclusion that the ruins of the former district represent the first settlements in the 
San Juan country, and that further developments will be found in the tributary 
valleys, and also that the large communal buildings on the tributaries of the San 
Juan, rejiresentiug the highest architectural art attained by the pueblo bmilders, 
will prove to be the ultimate form of the jirimitive village of this district. 

During the year Dr. Cj^rus Thomas completed the revision of proofs of text and 
illustrations of his report on mound explorations, and the work was put through tlie 
press as the body of the twelfth annual report. The document comprises much 
information relating to the Indian mounds of the Mississipjii Valley and eastern 
United States, and it seems reasonable to hope that the monograph may come to be 
regarded as a standard source of information on the subject. Subsequently Dr. 
Thomas gave special attention to the hieroglyphs and codices of the Maya — the 
ancient inhabitants of Yucatan. One of the results of the work is the demonstration 
that the time system recorded in the Dresden codex is precisely the same as that men- 
tioned by the early Spanish authors, except that the years begin with what are con- 
sidered the last instead of the first of the four-year series. It is also shown that this 
brings the calendar of the Dresden codex into harmony with the calendars recorded 
at Palenque, Lorillard City, and Tikal. A portion of the results of Dr. Thomas's 
work on this subject is published in one of the bulletins of the Bureau, a brochure 
of 64 pages, entitled ''The Maya Year." Other results are iucoriiorated in a bulletin 
on the origin and significance of the calendric terms, which is not yet completed. 

During the year Mr. Hilborue T. Cresson, of Philadelphia, was occupied in archa?- 
ologic researches, chiefly in Guatemala and eastern Mexico, under the provision of 
the De Laincel fund and under the general supervision of the Director of the Bureau. 
Some of the results of his interesting researches have been made public through 
various scientific journals. 

Specially noteworthy among the results of the archasologic work in the Bureau 
during the current year are the monographs by Mr. Holmes on ancient pottery of 
eastern United States and stone art of eastern United States. Both embrace the 
results of researches extending over many years; both are elaborately illustrated 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49 

from material preserved iu the National Museum; both represent the mature conclu- 
sious of an able aud carefully trained arch;i'ologist. The classification and interjjre- 
tation adopted by Mr. Holmes are primarily indigenous, though his comparative 
studies have extended over the archieologic literature of the world, and it is believed 
that his conclusions will form a lirm basis for those branches of arch;eology to which 
liis work relates. To him science is indebted for a consistent method of interpret- 
ing primitive art products through study of the arts of primitive [teoples cognate 
to those whose relics have come down to us from prehistoric times. It was with 
great regret that the Director accepted his resignation from the Bureau toward the 
end of the fiscal year, in order tliat he might transfer his labors to the Field Colum- 
bian Museum. 

DESCRIPTIVK ETHNOLOGY. 

An important line of work iu the Bureau for some years past has been the collec- 
tion aud systematic arrangement of tribal names and characteristics, with brief 
description of the habits, customs, arts, beliefs, and institutions of the aborigines. 
The information thus collected has been recorded on cards under the head of Tribal 
Synonymy. 

During the last year Mr. F. "W. Hodge devoted several months to the descriptive 
ethnology of several southwestern families, the Piman, Tanoan, Keresan, and Zunian 
stocks receiving chief attention. Advantage was taken of the presence in Wash- 
ington of Mr. Carl Lumholtz, who has spent several seasons among the tribes of 
Chihuahua, to oljtain valuable information relating to the Tarahumar, Tepehuan, 
and Tubar Indians for use in the synongmy of the Piman stock. Mr. Hodge's lit- 
erary research during the year has enabled him satisfactorily to identify the 
obscurely recorded Jumauo of the early Spanish explorers with the Comanche of 
more recent date. In connection with the condensed descriptions contained in the 
systematic work, Mr. Hodge has made progress in the preparation of a bibliography 
of the Pueblo Indians, designed to serve as a basis for further research concerning 
this interesting portion of our aboriginal population. 

Mr. J. Owen Dorsey made a number of important additions to the portion of the 
tribal synonymy relating to the Siouan tribes, and Mr. James Mooney devoted some 
time to classifying and extending the material already obtained relating to the 
Cherokee Indians. Mr. Albert S. C4atschet also made contributions to this work. 

Although the collection of material for the general descriptive ethnology of the 
tribal synonymy of the American Indians was commenced some years since, and 
although a large body of information has been collected and arranged on cards for 
office use, publication has not yet been undertaken, partly by reason of the great 
volume of the material, partly because the work is of such character as not soon to be 
completed, since each new investigation yields additional information ; but within 
the past five years the records have been found so useful, and the demand for 
information contained therein so extensive, that a plan for publication has been 
formulated. 

In accordance with this plan the material will be arranged by linguistic stocks and 
published in bulletin form in the order of completion, each bulletin comprising a 
stock. In addition to the usual pagination the bulletins devoted to the subject will 
be consecutively paged (at bottom) for the series, and it is proposed to complete the 
series by a bulletin so arranged as to form at the same time an index to the whole 
aud an abbreviated dictionary of the tribal and other names used by the American 
Indians. In accordance with this plan the materials pertaining to a number of the 
stocks have been made ready for the press, with the exception of brief introductions 
which remain to be written. 

During the first half of the fiscal year Dr. W. J. Hofiman continued the investi- 
gation of the Menomoni and related Indians in field and office and prepared an 
elaborate memoir, entitled "The Menomoni Indians,'' which has been submitted for 
publication in the fourteenth annual report. This tribe, located in northeastern 

SM 94 4 



60 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

Wisconsin, has long been known in a general way, but has received little scientific 
stndy. Dr. Hoffman's memoir embraces a history of the tri))e from their discovery 
by ISicollet in 1634 to the ])resent day, including the several treaties made with the 
Federal Government; it includes also the genealogies of the two rival lines of hered- 
itary chiefs, together with an exposition of the ceremonials (jf the several cult soci- 
eties, and of the mythology, industries, arts, and manufactures of the tribe. 

SOCIOLOGY. 

From time to time during the year the Director found opportunity for collecting 
additional information relating to the institutions of the American Indians and for 
the elaboration of material collected during j)revious years. Mr. McGee also made 
progress in the arrangement of material pertaining to this subject gathered by 
various collaborators. Mr. James Mooney spent several months in the held collect- 
ing information relating to the Kiowa, Caddo, Arapahoe, and Cheyenne Indians, of 
which a large part is sociologic. In addition he prepared during the year a memoir 
ontheSiouan Tribes of the East, -which has been sent to press as one of the series of 
bulletins of the Bureau. In this paper the relations and movements of the tribes 
recorded by early explorers and settlers of eastern United States are analyzed and, 
after comiiarative study for the purpose of combining the various consistent records 
and eliminating the uncertainties due to vague geographic and ethnographic records, 
grouped as a consistent body of information relating to the aboriginal laud-holders 
of cisappalachian United States. The memoir represents much patient research 
among early maps and throughout the earliest literature of the United States. It 
is enriched by synonymy of the various tribes of the district, and incidentally con- 
siderable information relating to the organization and social institutions of these 
tribes is incorporated. 

PICTOGRAPHY AND SIGN LANGUAGE. 

The earlier part of the year was spent by Col. Garrick Mallery in revising the 
proofs of his monograph on Picture Writing of the American Indians, Avhich has 
since been published in the tenth annual report of the Bureau. Some years were 
devoted by Colonel Mallery to the collection of information on this subject and the 
subject of sign language and gesture speech among the aborigines, and this mono- 
graph represents the product of labors in the interesting line of research to which it 
appertains. Bj' reason of the invasion of white men, many of the primitive customs 
of the Indians have been modified and some have been lost; and in few directions 
is the modification more complete than in that of inscribing records on rocks and 
other surfaces; and it has been the purpose to render this work as complete an expo- 
sition of the crude graphic art of the American Indian as it is jiossible to make at 
this time. It is believed that the work will be found practically exhaustive and a 
standard source of information. During the reuuiiuing portion of the year Colonel 
Mallery has been engaged in the pre])aratiou of acomi)anion monograph on the sign- 
language of tlie American Indians. The material for this work is eveumore evanes- 
cent tlian that drawn on in the preparation of the preceding work; but the author's 
studies have extended over many years and a large part of western America, and he 
has been favored by rich contributions from correspondents of the office. The work 
is fully illustrated, as is necessary, since it is ouly by graphic presentation that 
definite ideas concerning the multiform gestures and motions used in primitive inter- 
change of thought can be clearly expressed. The monograph is approaching com- 
pletion 

LINGUISTICS. 

The languages of the American Indians have received a large share of the atten- 
tion of the Bureau ever since its institution. It has been the i)olicy to collect texts 
and vocabularies and material for grammars as rapidly and extensively as possible 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 51 

before tbe disappearance of the primitive languages. Only a sin:ill part of the 
material so collected has been published; but the vaults of the Bureau are ricb in 
data pertaining to the languages of many tribes representing most of tbe linguistic 
stocks of the American Indians. Perhaps on no other continent has tbe linguistic 
diversification of primitive peoples been wider than in northern America, aud the 
dialectic variations are hardly less striking. The aboriginal languages of this con- 
tinent accordingly give an admirable opportunity for the study of the facts and 
causes of linguistic development; and from the beginning it was deemed important 
to collect the largest possible body of material for examination and discussion in its 
bearing on the general subject. Carrying out the general policy, only subordinate 
attention has been given to publication, and publication has been made only in 
cases in which the material seemed especially typical or exceptionally complete. 
Tbus, while the amount of linguistic material iiublished is not voluminous, the 
manuscripts constantly accessible I'or purposes of study are abundant — richer, it is 
believed, than any other body of linguistic records of a primitive people. 

Mr. A. S. Gatschet devoted the entire year to linguistic work. Early in the year 
he Avas employed in translating texts and in extracting lexic aud grammatic ele- 
ments of the Peoria and .Shawano languages, recorded by hiiu during the preceding 
two years. This work gave abundant opportunities for comparing the two tongues 
with the forty or fifty other dialects of the Algouquian stock, and the interesting 
results of the comparison were embodied in a comparative vocabulary of the Algon- 
(^uian languages. By this comparison the intimate relations between the dialects is 
strikingly shown and at the same time the multiplicity of forms into which the 
original tongues has been diversified has been brought out. Morphologically the 
Algonquian tongue is built on a purely nominal basis, yet in the various dialects a 
wide variety of ideas are expressed with surprising perfection. In all the Algon- 
quian dialects verbal roots combine with other verbal roots in a single word giving 
a peculiar and forcible expression to the verbal form. The compounding of words is 
further extended by numerous adjectival suffixes descriptive of quality, these suffixes 
indicating whether the noun qualified by such an adjective is an animate or inani- 
mate subject, and showing whether comjilexion, size, age, or other qualities are to 
be determined. This method of adjectival suffixes extends also to the numerals, and 
in some dialects there are special suffixes to qualify numeral cardinals as determin- 
ing aninuite or inanimate objects in the plural. Mr. Gatschet's recent studies have 
brought out the fact that the Algonquian languages of the western group (Arapahoe, 
Cheyenne, and Siksika) differ considerably in their jihonetics from the eastern dia- 
lects, these differences being-- especially shown in the nasalization found among the 
western representatives of the stock. 

Mr. J. Owen Dorsey spent the earlier part of the year in office work on the Biloxi 
language, completing its systematic arrangement for preservation and reference. 
He also revised the proofs of Contributions to North American Ethnology, Volume IX 
(Riggs's " Dakota Grammar, Texts, and Ethnography"), as well as his own memoir, 
entitled "A Study of Siouan Cults," in the eleventh annual report of the Bureau. 
Both of these documents have now been published. The month of January was 
spent on the Kwapa Reservation in Indian Territory in investigating the social organ- 
ization of the tribes and recording their myths and traditions in the form of texts. 
Alter his return from the field these texts were translated literally, but the prepara- 
tion of explanatory notes and free translations was deferred. Some time was spent 
in the elaboration of a list of the characters required for recording the various sounds 
in the Siouan, Athapascan, and other linguistic families; in this work he had for a 
time the assistance of a skilled oriental linguist, Dr. J. J. Nouri, from whom he 
obtained for comparative purposes many of the peculiar sounds of tbe Semitic and 
other Eastern languages. Some time was spent also in the examination of supposed 
linguistic aflinities between the Maya and Malay languages, and during the year bo 
recorded in final form eight Winnebago texts, dictate^ hy Philip Longtail. Suh§§. 



52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

quently literal translations of these texts were made, and the preparation of exjilaua- 
tory notes and free English translations was begun and the lexic eltuiients were 
extracted. 

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was occupied during the earlier part of the year in researches 
concerning the social relations recorded in the Iroquois language and the literature 
relating to the people. In the course of this work it was shown that the Independ- 
ence of the tribe in local affairs was little if at all curtailed by the confederation of 
the Five Nations, certain gentes being privileged from the beginning of the histori- 
cal leagues (for there were undoubtedly several) to nominate lord-chiefs and vice- 
chiefs to the league councils. Subsequently Mr. Hewitt made examination of the 
data for the classihcation of the Waiilatpuan and Shaliaptian groups of languages. 
Despite the paucity of the linguistic material, he found that the groups display 
peculiarities apparently due rather to divergent growth than to original diversity, 
this being exceptionally true of the position of the attributing or predicating word 
in the word-sentences or compound stems. In the lexicon the >Shahaptian dialects 
show apecitic superhcial differences from the Waiilatpuan group, but nevertheless a 
large and im2)ortant number of stems pertaining to the former, which have the same 
or cognate significance, accord substantially in sound or form with terms in the lat- 
ter; there are, moreover, in many of the dialects striking proofs of the effects of dis- 
cordant linguistic growth. The general result of the study was to prove that the 
two groups of languages have had a common history in part; and this conclusion 
has been provisionally accepted in the classihcation of linguistic material in the 
Bureau vaults. Other important studies relating to the atlinities of the aboriginal 
languages of northwestern America were successfully carried forward. Mr. Hewitt 
also aided in the linguistic comparison of the Maya and Malayan terms collected by 
Dr. Thomas. Some time was given also to the arrangement and transliteration of 
the Tubar material collected by Dr. Carl Lumholtz in Mexico, with a view to publi- 
cation. This collection, although not large, is of a special interest, since it was 
obtained from the last three surviving representatives of the tribe who alone survive. 
During the last months of the year Mr. Hewitt made a fruitful study of the so-called 
irregular or anomalous verb in the Tuskarora or Mohawk dialects. 

lu connection with memoirs on the Menomoni Indians, already noted. Dr. Hoff- 
man compiled a consideral)le vocabulary representing the language of this tribe. 

In addition to the Tubar material in part transliterated by ISIr. Hewitt, Dr. Carl 
Lumholtz turned over to the Bureau the vocabularies collected from the 'rarahumar 
and Tepehuan tribes occupying the mountainous portions of the state of Chihuahua, 
in the Republic of Mexico. Several other valuable contributions to the linguistic 
material of tlie Bureau were made during the year. Among these may be mentioned 
a manuscript of more than a thousand pages representing the vocabulary and gram- 
mar of the Nez Perce Indians of Idaho, collected by the late Miss S. L. McBeth and 
kindly transmitted to the Bureau by her sister, Miss Kate C. McBeth. 

AIYTHOLOCiY. 

The myths and cognate beliefs of the American aborigines are of exceptional inter- 
est, since they exemplify m many cases the intluence of environment on the minds 
of the devotees, and in some cases, moreover, the myths indicate the migrations of 
the peoples among Avhom they are found. Accordingly, the studies by Mrs. Steven- 
son and Mr. dishing of the mythology of the Pueblo tribes, particularlj^ that of the 
Zuni, are of utmost importance in American anthropology. 

Having completed his work in aiTanging the exhibits of the Bureau of American 
Ethnology at the World's Fair, Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing returned to Washing- 
ton and resumed researches in mythology about the middle of September. Almost 
continuously since that time he has, in conjunction with Mr. Stewart Culin, of the 
University of Pennsylvania, whose attention has long been devoted to the games of 
the Orient, carried forward a study of the origin of aboriginal games,, based on his 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53 

iutimiite acciuaiiitance with the j^ames of the Zimi and a kuowledge gained by his 
investigations at the World's Fair. 

A study of these primitive games reveals the fact that they were not jilayed for 
amusement, as among civilized people, 1)ut chiefly for divination, which was prac- 
ticed in connection with industries and enterprises of all sorts; so that divinatory 
games occupied a prominent place in the thoughts and exercised an important 
influence on tlie daily life of these people. It was also found that in the Orient the 
games were actually played with arrows and were still recognized as arrow games 
hy the players themselves as late as the eleventh or twelfth centuries B.C., thus 
giving historic evidence of the arrow origin of lot and dice games in the Orient, and 
confirming', in Mr. Culin's estimation, Mr. Cushing's hypothesis as to the identical 
origin of such games in America. These researches have also brought to light many 
signiticant facts bearing on the usages, beliefs, and ethnic relations of early peoples, 
and the material result of the investigation is an elaborate })aper on "Arrrow games 
and their variants in America and the (Orient," under the joint authorship of Messrs. 
Cushiug and Cnlin, now well advanced in preparation. Mr. Cushiug was greatly 
aided in this work by Mr. Louis C. Moctezuma, an educated young Mexican, from 
whom he obtained much information regarding the Indian games of his country. 

Mr. Cushiug has not allowed his researches relating to divinatory games com- 
pletely to interrupt his more general studies relating to Zuni mythology, and during 
the year has given special attention to the origin and primitive use of tire. Fire 
myths are nearly universal and Are worship common among primitive peoples; and 
it is the possession of fire making which perhaps more than any other characteristic 
distinguishes mankind from the lower animals. The conquest of fire has not yet 
been clearly traced, but Mr. Cushing's researches are contributing materially to 
knowledge of the subject. 

The manuscript of Mr. Cushing's paper bearing the title "Outlines of Zuni 
creation myths" was brought to completion and at the close of the year was par- 
tially in type as one of the accompanying pai)ers of the Thirteenth Annual Report. 

Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson, although partially disabled by overwork and 
exposure during her last field season among the Sia Indians of New Mexico, began 
in July the revision of the proofs of her article on that tribe which covered pages 
3-157 of the eleventh annual report. On the completion of the proof reading, early 
in September, Mrs. Stevenson continued the preparation of a report on certain myths 
and ceremonials of the Zuni tribe, among whom she has spent a number of seasons. 
Notwithstanding her ill health she succeeded in completing the preparation of most 
of the illustrative material of the monograph and well advanced the final revision 
of the text. 

PSYCHOLOGY. 

The Director has found opportunity for continuing his investigations in primitive 
modes of thought, carried on during previous years. The result of these studies 
was imparted to the members of the Bureau in a series of informal lectures for the 
purpose of establishing a firmer and more definite basis for their researches in Indian 
mythology and sociology. 

BIBLIOGRAPHY. 

The work on the bibliography of native American languages was continued by 
Mr. James C. Pilling. As in previous years much time was consumed in procuring 
new material for the mam catalogue, from which are prepared the bibliographies of 
the various linguistic stocks. This work necessitates a careful review of all the 
catalogue material relating to Americana generally — those of auction sales, of book- 
sellers' catalogues, of the reviews, etc.,— and these furnish brief titles, which are 
used as memoranda for further research. In this manner several hundred new 
titles have been added to the main catalogue during the year. For his painstaking 
and untiring patience in this tedious task Mr. Pilling is receiving high praise. The 



54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 

press reviews of the stoelc l)ihliograpliies already issued indicate the regard in which 
they are Iiekl, for their incomparable coini^leteuess, by students in all parts of the 
world. 

During the last year there was issued a liibliografiaEspauola de Lenguas iudigena 
de America, by the Comte de Vinaza, bearing the imprint Madrid, 1892. Although 
issued years after the appearance of Mr. Pilliug's " proof sheets," and although the 
compiler of the Bil)liografia had nnusual facilities, among them access to the archives 
of Spain — an advantage enjoyed by few if any foreigners, — bi^t seventy-five titles not 
already con tained in Mr . Filling's catalogue were found in the Comte de Vinaza's work. 

The month of August was taken up by Mr. Pilling with an examination of the 
plate proofs of the bibliography of the Salishan language, then ready for iiress, but 
little correction worthy of notice was necessary. The bulletin, which comprises 
86 pages and 1 facsimiles, was delivered by the Public Printer in the middle of 
November. 

During November work was renewed on the Wakashan bibliography. A trip 
ext(iudiugover a few days was made to Lenox and Astor libraries, New York City^ 
some new material being obtained and defective titles corrected. The work was 
forwarded to the Public Printer in .January, and by the close of March the proof 
reading was finished. This bibliography, which was ready for distribution early in 
May, comprises 70 pages and 2 facsimiles. During the proof reading of the Waka- 
shau bibliography the preparation of the bibliograjjhy of the Shahaptian languages 
was begun, and at the close of the fiscal year was in au advanced stage of progress. 

PUBLICATION. 

During no similar period of the Bureau's history have so many pages of ethno- 
logic material been put in tyjie. Since the close of the last fiscal year (1892-93) most 
of the proof reading of the Tenth Annual Report was completed. The volume was 
received from the printer iu .June, 1894. The monograph accompaujang this report, 
"Picture Writing of the American Indians," by Garrick Mallery, covers 807 ])ages 
and is illustrated by 54 plates and 1,290 figures. On July 27, 1893, the P^leventh 
Annual Report was seut to the Public Printer, and before the close of October all the 
proofs had Ijeeu read. Proof reading of the Twelfth Annual Report was in progress 
at the close of the year 1892-93, and continued until April, 1894. This report, which, 
iu addition to the administrative report of the Director, contains a paper by Mr. 
Cyrus Thomas, entitled "Report on the mound exploration of the Bureau of Eth- 
nology," was in the bindery at the close of the year. In February, 1894, the manu- 
script of the Thirteentji Annual Report was sent to the Public Printer, and in June 
the first proofs were received. With the close of the fiscal year all the illustrations 
for this annual had been engraved, and jtroof reading was well advanced. 

At the close of the year 1892-93 the proof reading of the "Bibliography of the 
Salishan Languages," by Jamea Constantine Pilling, was almost completed. This 
bulletin was delivered by the printer in November, 1893. The Bibliography of the 
Wakashan Languages, }ty the same author, was seut to the printer in December, 
1893; the first proofs were received in January, 1894; the proof reading was finished 
in April, and the edition was delivered a month later. 

Early in January of the iiresent year the manuscript of a bulletin by Mr. .John 
Garland Pollard, on thv, Pamuukey Indians of Virginia, was sent to the Public 
Printer, and by February the final proofs had beeu revised. This bulletin was 
delivered in April, 1894. 

At the close of the last fiscal year proof reading of Riggs' "Dakota Grammar, 
Texts, and Ethnograi)hj'," which forms Contributions to North American Ethnology, 
Volume IX, had beeu in progress about a month, and by the end of July the volume 
was in iiage form. 

The first proof of a bulletin entitled "The Maya Year," by Dr. Cyrus Thomas, was 
received early in February, 1894, the manuscript having been transmitted January 
19. This brochure passed through the press and was delivered in May. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 55 

In January, 1894, there was also sent to the Public Printer the manuscript of the 
first of a i)roposecI series of bulletins, entitled ''Chinook Texts," by Dr. Franz Boas. 
The first proofs were received in March, and by July 1 176 pages and a number of 
galleys were in type. 

Another bulletin, "An Ancient Quarry in Indian Territory,'' l)y Williaiii H. Holmes, 
was sent to the Public Printer on February 17, and by the close of June the paper 
was in type. 

The following publications were received from press during the fiscal year: 

Ninth Annual Report, for 1887-88, containing, in addition to the Director's report 
of 46 pages, the fidlowiug papers : ( 1) " Ethnological results of the Point Barrow expe- 
dition," by John Murdoch. Pages 3 to 441, Pis. I-II, figs. 1-428. (2) " The medicine 
men of the Apaches," by .John G. Bourke. Pages 443 to 603, Pis. III-VIII, figs.

MI.SCELLANEOUS. 

Classification of manuscripts. — In the current appropriation for American Ethnology, 
provision was made for rental of quarters for the use of the Bureau, and in accord- 
ance therewith the sixth floor of the Adams Building on F street was leased. In addi- 
tion to increased floor space for the use of its collaborators when not engaged in 
field work, the Bureau now has two large fireproof vaults, in which has been safely 
deposited the large body of valual)le manuscript material in its possession. This 
material, couiprising over 1,400 specific linguistic papers, 60 miscellaneous linguistic 
papers, and 236 manuscripts on miscellaneous ethnologic subjects, has been tenta- 
tively catalogued by subject, linguistic family, and author, and another catalogue 
alphabetically arranged by catalogue and unit is now being x»repared. 

World's Colnmbian Exposition.—Thehihorot' preparing the exhibit of the Bureau of 
American Ethnology at the World's Columbian Exposition was assigned to Mr. Wil- 
liam H. Ilohues, whowas assisted by Mr. Frank Hauiiltou Gushing. After directing 
the installation of the collectionsMr. Holmes returned to Washington, leaving to Mr. 
Gushing the final arrangement of a number of lay figures which had been prepared 
by Messrs. Holmes, Mooney, and Gushing. Mr. Gushing remained at the Exposition 
in charge of the Bureau exhibit until the middle of September, meanwhile conduct- 
ing the study of primitive American games noted above. 

It is gratifying to be able to state that the figures and other collections 
exhibited by the Bureau at the Chicago Exposition met with high praise from 
every quarter. A report on these collections is in course of preparation by Mr. 
Gushing with a view to publication. 

Lihran/. — From the time of the establishment of the Bureau until the autumn of 
1893 the books received through gift, exchauge, or purchase, were temporarily 
deposited in the library of the Geological Survey. Wheu the Bureau moved into 
independent quarters Mr. Hodge, iu connection with his work on synonymy, was 
placed in charge of the library, which then numbered about 2,600 volumes. At the 
close of the year the library had increased to 4,350 volumes, chiefly through exchange

Appendix III. 

REPORT OF THE CURATOR OF EXCHANGES FOR THE YEAR ENDING 

JUNE 30, 1894. 

Sir: I have the honor to present the following report upon the operations of the 
Bureau of International Exchanges for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894. 

It is confined, for the sake of convenient comparison, almost entirely to the pre- 
sentation of statistics, compiled upon the plan established in 1888. 

The Exchange Service has been conducted during the year under exceptionally dis- 
advantageous conditions, owing to tlio decrease in the appropriation made by 
Congress to the Institution for tlie conduct of the exchange operations, and also 
owing to the fact that some of the Government bureaus transmitting large uumliers 
of documents were unable at the end of the year to reimburse the Institution, as 
hitherto, for the expense incurred. 

The actual number of packages received during the year was somewhat less than 
during the year xirecediug, though the weight was considerably greater. This 
decrease in the number of packages was due in part to the fiict that toward the 
close of the fiscal year, no deficiency appropriation having been passed by Congress, 
it became necessary to restrict the operations of the Exchange Service, and to notify 
a number of correspondents that it would be impracticable to transmit their 
exchanges abroad until a further appropriation from Congress became available. A 
further cause of the decrease was the discontinuance of the transmission in the 
special Congressional Library exchange of a large number of small pamphlets or 
orders from the "War Deiiartment, occupying but a page or two each. 

Notwithstanding this fact, it will be seen that 27 more cases wore shipped abroad 
than during any previous year. 

TABULAR STATEMENT OF THE WORK OF THE BUREAU. 

The work of the Bureau is succinctly given in the annexed table, i>rei)ai*ed in a

Etei^ORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The apparent decrease in the number of correspondents shown in the following 
table is to be explained from the fact that the present figures represent the actual 
count of the ledger cards under the system adopted in 1892. The corresponding 
figures in the table of last year represent the total number of correspondents on 
both the new and old system of ledger cards. 

For comparison with previous years, I add a statement from 1888 to 1894, which 
will make apparent the growth in the service :

EXPENSES. 

The expense of the exchange system is met in j^art by direct appropriation by 
Congress to the Smithsonian Institution for the purpose and in part by appropria- 
tions made to different Government departments or bureaus, either in their contin- 
gent funds or in specific terms for repayment to the Institution for a portion of the 
cost of transportation. 

In addition to the transmission of its own documents the Government has under- 
taken, through a treaty which was concluded at Brussels in 1886, and formally 
ratified and proclaimed by the President of the United States in 1889, the exchange 
of the publications of learned societies in this and other countries and the Smith 
sonian Institution has been recognized as the medium in the United States through 
which this exchange is to be effected, other governments having established special 
exchange bureaus for the purpose. 

In 1878 the Board of Regents established a charge of 5 cents per pound weight for 
the publicationssent out or received by the various Government bureaus, this charge 
being necessary to prevent an undue tax upon the resources of the Institution. 
For similar reasons it has been found necessary to make a charge of like amount 
to State institutions, from which a further small revenue has been derived. 

As the same reasons for the continuance of this charge have existed to the present 
time, the appropriations by Congress never having been sufficient to meet the entire 
expense of the service, recommendation has frequently been made that tlie entire 
appropriation allowed by the Government should be contained in a single item to the 
Smithsonian Institution. 

The appropriation made by Congress to the Institution for the Exchange Service 
for the fiscal year 1893-94 was in the following terms: 

"For expenses of the system of international exchanges between the United 
States and foreign countries, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, 
including salaries or compensation of all necessary employes, fourteen thousand 
five hundred dollars." 

The receipts and disbursements by the accounting officer of the Smithsonian lusti-

The foregoing table shows that the entire amount received from Government

the specific jturpose of exchanges $16,665.95, while the expenses amounted to 
$17,610.31, leaving a deficiency of $944.36. 

An estimate for the entire expense of the service of $23,000 was submitted in 
October, 1892, this sum being intended to include in a single appropriation various 
small items in different appropriation bills, and also an item of $2,000 to cover the 
expense of an immediate exchange of parliamentary documents with the countries 
entering into the treaty at Brussels in 1886. 

I would again call attention to the fact that no appropriation has been made for 
this latter purpose. 

CORUESPO.NDENTS. 

As mentioned in previous reports, it became necessary in the latter part of 1891 to 
provide for an addition to the series of " ledger" cards upon which were entered all 
packages sent or received from a given society or individual. A plan was approved 
by which the cards were much reduced in size, the bulk of the older cards having 
already become a matter of serious consideration. 

The new and smaller ledger cards were begun on January 1, 1892, and since that 
date all the transactions have been entered upon them. The abbreviation of the 
records and their greater convenience in handling proved to be of the utmost service 
when it became necessary to reduce the clerical force in the office, and it is only by 
such abbreviation of the records and by the introduction of several minor labor- 
saving devices that it has been at all possible to prevent the Avork from falling 
irretrievably behind. 

The number of new ledger cards on June 30, 1893, was 16,340, and on June 30, 1894, 
20,223. This difterence of 3,883 represents the increase in the number of new socie- 
ties or individuals during the year making use of the service, while the entire num- 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61 

her of cards, 20,223, is the number of societies and individuals, botli domestic and 
foreign, with which the lixchange Office has had rehations since January 1, 1«92. 
The new list of correspondents is classified as follows:

uary 1,1892.

Individuals

6,991 
8,619 



1,620 
2,993 



15,610 



4,613 



The actual count of the list of correspondents printed in 1886, together with all 
the additions made since, gives 9,212 foreign societies; of which, however, 2,221 are 
not as yet represented upon the new ledger cards. The accompanying map will 
convey most clearly an idea of the wide distribution of these correspondents. 

The entire record tile of the Exchange Office contains the names of approximately 
13,500 individuals and 11, .500 institutions; and, although a considerable number of 
these represent defunct institutions or individuals, their registry with a statement 
of this fact is often of very great value in the Exchange Service. 

Attention has been directed for sometime past to the fact that the list of corre- 
spondents in the p]xchauge Office requires revision and recopying upon caids, the 
original office list prepared and printed in 1886 having become so worn and so over- 
ciowded by frequent interlineations as to be almost illegible. 

The special exchange list for the distribution of Smithsonian documents is also in 
need of revision and correction. It was prepared many years ago, and not a few of the 
libraries to which it was deemed proper at the time to send these publications have 
sunk into obscurity, while many new libraries have been established to which it 
seems desirable that Smithsonian documents should be sent. A considerable number 
of requests are received each year inviting an exchange of publications, or requests 
for the completion of the Smithsonian series of docuiuents, with which it is rarely 
practicable to comply. It is earnestly hoped, therefore, that means will be found 
for revising this list and the general exchange list of correspondents. Either of 
these lists present a task of considerable magnitude, and it is manifestly impossible 
with the present force of employees — which is hardly able to keep up with the cur- 
rent work of the Bureau — to enter upon such an undertaking at the present time. 

The last list of Smithsonian correspondents, that published in 1886, is the only 
one to which applicants can now be referred. That a printed list of the addresses 
of the principal learned societies and libraries of the world woiild be thoroughly 
appreciated, the frequent inquiries made to the Exchange Office abundantly testify. 

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS. 

Under the treaty of Brussels of 1886, the text of which was given in full in the 
report of the Curator of Exchanges for 1887-88, the exchange of the official publi- 
cations of the United States Government with other countries has been continued 
by the Institution, and it now forms a very large proportion of the Bureau's work. 

The entire number of publications sent abroad during the year under the provision 
of the act of Congress of March 2, 1867, and of the treaty above referred to, was 
15,000, and there have been received in return 8,812 packages. The United States 
Oovernmeut departments have forwarded to their correspondents abroad 28,285 
packages, and have received in return 14,555 packages. The total number of 
exchanges for government libraries has therefore been 23,367 packages received and 
43,285 packages sent abroad, a total of 66,652 packages, or about 67 per cent of the 
entire number handled. 



62 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 



The very inadequate return for the great number of documents sent out is in part 
undoubtedly due to the fact that uo other country publishes on such a lavish scale 
as our own. Direct solicitation made by a special representative to the governments 
with Avhich the Institution are in correspondence would also probably result in a 
considerable increase to the library of Congress. 

The exchange on account of Government bureaus is shown in detail in the follow- 
ing table :

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63 

EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE. 

I ngret to report that, througli circumstances over which the personnel of the 
Exchange Office could have no control, it was found impracticable to pi"event the 
work of the year from falling in arrears. 

The appropriation for the fiscal year was $2,500 less than for the j^ears immediately 
preceding, and during the latter half of the year, no deficiency appropriation hav- 
ing been passed by Congress it became necessary to curtail the expenses in every 
possible way by reducing the number of employees and otherwise in order that the 
regular appropriation might not be exceeded. 

A further embarrassment arose from the fact already stated that some of the Gov- 
ernment bureaus, ordinarily sending a very considerable number of documents 
abroad through the Smithsonian Institution, were unable to reimburse the Institu- 
tion, as in previous years, for the cost of transportation advanced to meet the 
expense involved. 

In several instances, therefore, it became necessary to advise con-espondeuts that 
it would be impossible to receive and transmit their publications until after the 
close of the fiscal year, and, as freight charges could not be met, a very large number 
of documents, constituting the miscellaneous exchanges, as well as some 7,000 Con- 
gressional documents to be transmitted to parliamentary libraries with which the 
exchange for the Library of Congress is conducted, had to be held over until after 
the new appropriation became available. 

The exchange relations with Greece are in the same condition as a year ago, when, 
on account of the expenses attending the distril)utiou of packages, the transmission 
of miscellaneous exchanges was discontinued by request of the librarian of the 
United National and University Libraries, formerly acting as the medium for dis- 
tributing publications. 

The transmissions to Brazil and Chile, which were for a time suspended, were 
renewed, but the exchange with Mexico is still in an extremely unsatisfactory con- 
dition, and the transmission of the parliamentary documents to the Mexican Gov- 
ernment has been suspended awaiting some action by the Mexican authorities, to 
whose attention the matter was brought through the Mexican minister. 

The difficulties attending the transmission of documents to India has been finally 
met by the action of the Secretary to the Government of India, at Calcutta, in 
obtaining the consent of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India to continue the 
former arrangement under which publications intended by the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion for private institutions and individuals, as well as for Government depart- 
ments and individuals in their official capacity, were forwarded to India from 
Loudon by the director-general of stores, at the cost of the civil department. 

I take much pleasure in bearing witness to the efficiency of the employees in the 
Exchange Office and in expressing api)reciation of their efi'orts to keep up with the 
added volume of work in spite of the unavoidable reduction in the force, and I beg 
leave to call to your notice the careful attention to the interests of the Insitntion on 
the part of its special agents abroad. Dr. Felix Fliigel, in Leipsic, and Messrs. 
William Wesley & Son, in London. 

The Smithsonian Institution is also under special obligation to the Secretary of 
the Treasury who has designated an officer of the United States Custom-House in 
New York, to receive and despatch to Washington cases containing international 
exchanges, all of these cases being passed both in this country and abroad free of 
custom duties. 

Grateful acknowledgments are also <lue to the following transportation companies 
and others for their liberality in granting the privilege of free freight or in other- 
wise assisting in the transmission of exchange parcels and boxes, while to other 
firms thanks are due for reduced rates of transportation in consideration of the 
disinterested services of the Institution in the diffusion of knowledge:

Appendix IV, 

KEPORT OF THE HUl'EKlNTENDENT OF THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL 

PARK. 

Siu: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the 
National Zoolofjical Park for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894: 

The progress of the park has been along the lines already indicated in former 
reports. The appropriation granted by Congress being insutficient to permit the 
construction of any important new structures, attention has mainly been given to 
perfecting the accommodations already established and to improving the means of 
access enjoyed by the public. 

The location of the deer paddocks, on the eastern bank of the little stream that 
flows through the park, was found unfavorable, they being situated there against 
the boundary fence, and the deer being consequently endangered by the presence of 
dogs roving in the vicinity of the park. The sight of a dog frightened them to such 
an extent as to cause them to injure themselves in their efforts to escape. Several 
of them were killed, breaking their necks by running violently against the fence, 
others broke their legs by becoming entangled, and still others, after leaj)ing a fence 
eight feet high were recaptured with much difficulty. The force of watchmen at the 
park being insufficieni; to fully guard against such accidents, it was thought best to 
remove the paddocks to a protected situation within the park, at a suificient dis- 
tance from the boundary fence to prevent disturbance of the animals. A site 
was ■ selected a short distance below the llama house, and a suitable barn or 
shelter was constructed of rough beams and thatch, as shown in the accompanying 
illustration. The paddocks were inclosed by light wire fencing 8 feet in height. 
No further trouble has arisen with the deer since this change was made. The 
approximate cost of the house and paddocks was $600. 

It being desirable to place the beavers in a locality suitable for their habits, 
a retired valley was selected from which the public could be excluded, and the 
animals were allowed to build undisturbed. These results were even more satis- 
factory than were expected, as the animals at once commenced to cut down trees of 
considerable size, and to construct a dam and a lodge. It is hoped that others may 
be secured, and that they may be partially domesticated so as to carry on their 
interesting operations under the observations of the public. 

The large pond for waterfowl and other aquatic animals, situated south of the 
meadow near the bridge, has finally been completed, but is not yet fenced in so as to 
retain the animals. A smaller pond on the left bank of Rock Creek, near the Quarry 
road entrance, has been prepared for swans. This will prove a picturesque feature 
at this point, as water can be led into and out of it by a series of small cascades, 
which will aff"ord a pleasing variety. 

The site of the prairie-dog town, among trees upon the top of a gravelly knoll, is 
found to be unsatisfactory. It seems probable that when a large number are 
confined in a limited space for a considerable length of time, the ground becomes 
impregnated with injurious matters. It has been noted that the number of these 
animals has been gradually decreasing, and it is estimated that the total has fallen 
off by as many as 75 during the year. As soon as funds are available for the purpose, 
it is intended to remove them to a healthier situation, and to arrange so that they

may be shifted from time to time. The present site will be an admirable situation 
for a public comfort room and refectory, which is greatly neeiled for the accommo- 
dation of the i)nblic. 

A considerable sum has been spent in preparing a driveway from the animal house 
to the west gate, through one of the most beautiful regions of the park. Consid- 
erable excavations and fills were necessary at various points, and the sum at the dis- 
posal of the administration was insufficient to properly surface and finish the road. 
A substantial gutter was, however, laid upon the side of tiie roadway. During dry 
summer weather this road is satisfactory, but the frosts of winter make it so soft as 
to be almost impassable. 

Seventy-three animals were lent the park during the winter by the proprietor of 
the Forepaugh show. This proved a great attraction to the public, obtained at very 
slight expense, the only increased charge being the food consumed. It is believed 
that it would be advantageous to continue the practice of taking suitable and inter- 
esting animals for the expense of their maintenance, as by this means some specimens 
are almost certain to be added permanently to the collection, one of the stipulations 
made in such cases being that all animals born in the park shall become the property 
of the Government. A kangaroo and a monkey were in this way obtained. 

The collection has thriven fairly well during the year, considering the fact that 
no purchases can be made and that it is so much dependent on gifts— a list of the 
donors of which is appended. The number of animals on hand at the close of the 
fiscal year was 510, being a slight increase on the number at the beginning of the 
year. The number of deaths was 251, chiefly among the smaller species, a consid- 
erable number occurring among animals that were in bad condition when they were 
lent to the park. 

Among the interesting accessions was a young black bear, born on February 5, 
1894. There are but few opportunities for observing the growth of these animals, 
as they are rarely born in captivity. The little creature was very small at birth, 
not larger than a good-sized rat, weighing but nine ounces, and it was thirty-nine 
days before it opened its eyes. It has been very vigorous and healthy from the 
first, and its development was evidently normal. A fine young African lion, from 
IMashonaland, was presented by Mr. H. C. Moore, and promises to become a very 
large animal when full grown.

Appendix V. 



REPORT ON THE ASTRO-PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY. 

As iudicated in my last report, tlie general work of the Observatory for the fiscal 
year has continued to be the investigation of the infra-red solar spectrum described 
in the general body of the report for 1893. This work may conveniently be divided 
into three parts : 

A. General spectrobolographic work, 

B. Special spectrobolographic work. 

C. Instrumental work^ including manufacture of new apparatus and the perfec- 
tion of old. 

A. The general spectrobolographic work of the year may be summed up as follows : 
(A "holograph" is an automatic reproduction of the curve representing the distribu- 
tion of the energy in the infra-red spectrum.)

A complete record of these holographic curves, automatically registered by the 
apparatus upon glass plates, has been filed for future investigation, the work in its 
present stage being confined, as has already been stated, to the exploration of this 
hitherto unexplored region and the identification of its landmarks. 

The result of the Avork has been extremely satisfactory, so far as regards the niimber 
and importance of the lines found. The accompanying illustration (see plate) show- 
ing a portion of the infra-red spectrum from the region l.ijii to 2.2/ii, beyond what a 
few years ago was considered the limit of the infra-red spectrum, will show the 
detail and clearness with which the present apparatus is capable of rendering what 
can, only in the absence of a better word, be called the "appearance" of this region, 
since, it must be borne m mind, no human being has senses capable of directly 
discriminating between these interruptions, or of directly perceiving the form of 
this display of energy.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 



The portion of the infra-re,l spectrum shown, which is that at present furthest 
advanced, has been gone over several times, and each of the mor^e than 200 hnes 
which occupy this p ate has been verified by many observations. The plate shows 
but asmalpart of the region which is now being mapped, in all of which it is 
leZJrT ''' '^^ ^'^"""^ encouraging. Although no investigation has 

been made of the mean.ng of the many significant lines in this great and now first 




exhibited region, it is reasonable to think that their study may lead to conclusions 
ot only less importance than those resulting from the similar Frauenhofer lines in the 
visible spectrum. It is especially believed that the science of meteorolo-y mav 
become indebted to a study of this region for many indications of phenomena 
which can not now be foretold with any degree of accuracy. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 77 

Three of these holographs, taken from a large numher covering the same region, 
are shown in the illustration (Fig. 1), in order that the manner of recording the 
variations in the distribution of the energy in this j)ortion of the spectrum may be 
shown, as well as the agreement of distinct observations made of the same region 
at different times. 

In order to accomplish this agreement and accuracy in the curves, many changes 
suggested by experience have had to be made in the apparatus and equipment. 
The temporary and overcrowded quarters in which this apparatus is stored have 
been more and more occupied as the mechanical difficulties in the work increased, 
until now the space is totally inadequate to the needs of sucli an investigation, 
while an even more serious difficulty is that the locality is in the neighborhood of 
street traffic, and disturbed by continual tremors. 

B. The special holographic work which is carried on during days unfavorable for 
taking observations iucludes the classification, detailed examination, and finally, 
the reduction of the holographs taken into linear translations of the curves, in 
which the final result is similar, so far as the automatic reduction processes will 
admit, to the photograjihs of the visible part of the spectrum. 

Much attention has been given to the photographic work, which has presented 
problems somewhat difficult of solution. Much of the photographic apparatus has 
had to be specially designed and constructed to fit the peculiar conditions governing 
its use, but the present process, it is believed, will meet any exigencies of the work. 

The work in this direction has kept pace with the original holographs and I hope 
soon to be able to issue the preliminary charts covering at least a portion of the 
region under investigation. 

C. What may be called the principal work of the Observatory of this kind during 
the year has been the improvement of the apparatus and the instrumental conditions, 
the lines of development being — 

(1) Toward an increase of delicacy. 

(2) Toward increased stability and accuracy. 

The galvanometer, whose relative importance in the train of apparatus may almost 
be compared to that of the brain in the nervous system, has been perfected still 
further than was noted in my last report. 

The utility of these improvements, however, has been, as I have already said, 
greatly impaired by the situation of the Observatory, close to traveled streets, 
where it is subject to disturbances of the most annoying kind. This will be better 
understood when it is considered that the galvanometer never moves very sensibly 
under a change of temperature on the holograph of less than a millionth of a degree ; 
that it is on the registry of these minute changes that the whole system of discov- 
ery rests, and that false changes can be introduced by the magnetism or the tremor 
from passing traffic, which so embarrass the observer and enhance his labor 
that it may be said to be almost hopeless to introduce any great further improve- 
ment in this direction till the Observatory occupies a site free from such disturb- 
ances, in place of its present temporary and most unsuitable quarters. These inter- 
ruptions and disturbances, whether magnetic or seismic, have prevented, except at 
rare and short intervals, the full use of the apparatus in its more delicate capacities. 

Apjiaratus. — The clockwork, upon which depends much of the accuracy and con- 
sequently the final efficiency of the observations, has been continually studied and 
improved. 

The siderostat has been under continued improvements suggested by experience, 
but these will be better described when complete. 

The Observatory, during the year, has received from the commissioners of the Rus- 
sian Government to the World's Fair a very large block of optically fine rock salt 
from the mines, from which a collimatiug lens over 7 inches in diameter aud a prism 
7 inches in height has been wrought (by Brashear), which, it is believed, are the 
largest of their material in the world. To this prism and lens is due much of the 
increased efficiency of the whole train of apparatus. 



78 REPORT OP THE SECRETARY. 

MINOR WORK OF THE YEAR. 

A number of direct photographs of a portiou of the visible spectrum and as much 
of the lufra-red as could be readily photographed were made by Mr. L. E. Jewell, 
with the object of comparing direct photographs with holographs of the same 
region made under similar conditious. 

A number of enlargements of the spectro-bolographic charts already finished have 
been made with a view to their early publication. '

Appendix VI. 
REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1894. 

Sir: I have the houor to submit herewith a report upon the operations of the 
Library of the Smithsonian Inst'tution during the fiscal j'ear ending June 30, 1894. 

The work of recording accessions has been conducted as heretofore, each publica- 
tion being entered as received and given a special number. While this plan causes 
the exhibit of numbers iu excess of volumes received, there is to set oft' against it 
the fact that an entire series received at one time is given but a single number. 

The numbers in the accession book of the Smithsonian deposit at the Library of 
Congress extend from 268387 to 292425; in all, 24,038 entries, an increase iu numbers 
over the year 1892-93 of 1,762. 

The following tables show the number of volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets, 
and charts received during the year: 

Publications received hefween July 1, 189S, and June 30, 1894.

This table shows an increase in publications over the year 1892-93 of 8,464. 

Of these publications 587 volumes, 10,2.56 parts of volumes, and 1,575 pamphlets, 
12,418 in all, were retained for use in the United States National Museum. 

One thousand three hundred and forty-six medical dissertations were deposited in 
the library of the Surgeon General, United States Army. The remaining publications 
were sent to the Library of Congress on the Monday after their receipt. 

Besides these publications entered in the accession book of the Smithsonian 
deposit of the Library of Congress there have been entered in the "office book" 
1,580 numbers (extending from No. 4089 to No. 5669), representing 1,874 volumes and 
parts of volumes received, and making a grand total of accessions for the year of 
39,826 publications. 

This does not include a small number of books and journals purchased for the use 
of the Astrophysical Observatory and of the Zoological Park. 

The following universities have sent academic publications and inaugural disser- 
tations : 



Basel, 

Berlin,

80 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

In 1887 you organized a plan for increasing the library by excbauges. Lists of 
periodicals were secured from the British Museum, several universities, and a great 
number of leading specialists. These lists were carefully revised and correspond- 
ence entered upon with each society and journal there represented. During the 
year this work was completed. Immediately upon its completion a new list of all 
scientific publicatioi\s issued in France was secured, and, after revision, correspond- 
ence was entered upon; 1,191 letters asking for publications not on our list, or for 
numbers to complete the series already in the library, have been written. As a 
result, 503 new exchanges were acquired by the Institution, while 133 defective 
series were either completed or added to as far as the publishers were able to supply 
missing parts. This result is very nearly double that attained last year. 

Since 1887, 5,831 letters have been written for the purpose of increasing the num- 
ber of periodicals and transactions of learned societies in the library; 1,853 new 
periodicals have been added to the list of those received, and 1, 042 defective series 
have been either wholly or partially completed. 

Four thousand -two hundred and thirty-six acknowledgments of publications 
received were made by the post card and other printed forms, while many gifts were 
acknowledged by special letter. 

Three sectional libraries are now established in the Institution — the editor's, the 
astronomical, and one for works on aerodromics. 

In the last report attention was called to the crowded condition of the library 
offices. Since that time two additional rooms have been assigned, one for a collection 
of books required for reference, and the other as an office for the librarian. In tliis 
reference room, besides cyclopedias and dictionaries, are placed the publications of 
six of the great scientific societies of the world. 

A room has also been set apart for the collections of prints belonging to the Institu- 
tion. A few of these have been framed and hung upon the walls, the remainder 
being retained in bound volumes and portfolios. 

The card-catalogue record of periodicals received has oeeu transferred from the 
largo cards formerly employed to the smaller card, known as the postal size; a new 
card catalogue of periodicals in the Institution has also been prepared for the read- 
ing room. 

The library is governed by the following regulations, which with slight additions 
were drawn up by the present Secretary some years ago : 

CONSTITUTION OF THE CENTRAL LIBRARY. 

1. By act of Congress of April 5, 1866, the library of the Smithsonian lustitntion 
is to be kept with the Library of Congress, but with the provision that the Institu- 
tion shall continue to enjoj' its customary use of it. The following regulations refer 
only to those books which under the above proviso are retained at the Smithsonian 
Institution proper, or in its Museum library. 

2. By order of the Secretary, after April 1, 1887, these are placed in the immediate 
charge of a librarian, whose title shall be "libiarian of the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion," and whose duty it shall be to decide what books shall be retained from the 
Library of Congress in a central library under his charge. The following regulations 
are intended for the better execution of the aforesaid order : 

SECTIONAL LIBRARIES. 

3. Sectional libraries may be formed by the Assistant Secretary, the Chief Cleik, 
or assistant in charge, and also by the curators and acting curators, and the editor. 
Curators and acting curators are permitted, subject to the approval of the Assistant 
Secretary in charge of the Museum, to form sectional libraries to be kept in their 
respective offices; but this shall only be done by withdrawing from the general col- 
lection such books as relate exclusively to the objects under their care. Dictionaries, 
cyclopedias, journals, or any works other than such as relate exclusively to the 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 81 

special department, cau not form a part of such a sectional library, except upon the 
recommendation of the librarian, approved by the Assistant Secretary. 

4. The official in charge of each sectional library shall be responsible for its safe- 
keeping and shall on no account lend the books. 

5. Books in the sectional library must be returned to the central library before 
they can be issued for use outside of the office or room to which they are accredited. 

6. The books of each sectional library shall be kept separate from all other books 
in the rooms of the official or curator, in distinct cases, the locks of which shall be 
controlled by a master key in the hands of the librarian, who may, at stated times, 
examine them and call the attention of the curators to any deficiencies. 

7. No person who is not a member of the scientific staff of the Institution or 
Museum shall withdraw books or other matter without written permission from the 
Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the assistant in charge, the 
curator in charge of the Museum, or the librarian. Persons taking books from the 
central library shall be responsible for the safe-keeping of the same, and shall make 
good any losses. They shall not be allowed to withdraw other books until those 
which are lost have been restored. 

8. The librarian shall have authority to decide what books are suitable for any 
curator's sectional library, and to recall any book not in a sectional library within 
two weeks. Permanent recalls of books from sectional libraries may be made, as 
well as temporary calls. In case of certain rare, or costly, or encyclopedic works, 
or in other special instances, the librarian- shall be authorized to designate books 
which shall in no case be taken from the library. These regulations shall not 
apply to any books now actually in the office of the editor. All books and other 
matter not in the sectional library shall be at all times subject to recall by the 
librarian. 

9. The librarian will be expected to exercise his discretion as to the books to be 
withdrawn from the Congressional Library, but will (in the absence of special cause 
to the contrary) recall anj^ book upon receiving a written request for the same. 

10. The librarian shall annually, or oftener, report to the Secretary any defective 
series, any missing books, or any new serials or books which are specially desirable. 

REGULATIONS CONCERNING ENTRY AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF BOOKS. 

11. All books, pamphlets, maps, and other publications acquired by the Smith- 
sonian Institution through exchange, or donation, or purchase shall be separately 
entered by the librariau, who shall prepare reference lists, with the aid of which he 
shall, immediately upon their receipt from the assistant in charge of office, divide 
them into two classes ; one of which is to be fully entered within a day of its receipt, 
the otlier to be fully entered in any case at some time within the current week. 

12. It shall be an invariable rule that such a full entry, to consist of both a day- 
book and a ledger-account entry, shall be made within the above-specified time, for 
every separate book, or pamphlet, or map, without exception; but it is understood 
that this ledger account may be in the form of a card catalogue. 

13. Against every title there shall be entered in the daybook the letter "C" 
(Smithsonian Library deposited in Library of Congress), or "G" (Smithsonian 
Library deposited with Surgeon-General), or "1" (Smithsonian Library deposited 
at the Institution). Books purchased at the Institution's cost and intended for the 
Secretary's library, or the office library, shall be entered in a separate book, and it 
shall be the duty of the librarian to see that all books of the first class are prepared 
for delivery to the Librarian of Congress within the current week. 

14. The librarian shall notifj' the exchange department within the current week of 
any new correspondent on his books, and shall also acknowledge receipt to the 
senders or donors of every article, at stated times, at intervals of not more than a 
year, and shall make a record of such entry with the date of acknowledgment oppo- 
site to the entry of the work in question. 

SM 94 6 



82 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

15. It shall be the duty of the librarian at all times to hold these books, in classes 
'' C '" and " G," open to the inspection of the Librarian of Congress, and to report 
to him the place and condition of any work under his charge in answer to any specific 
inquiry. 

16. In addition to the books wliich are included in the Smithsonian deposit in the 
Library of Congress, and so stamped, there are certain books procured by the 
Smithsonian Institution for use in the National Museum. These shall be distinct- 
ively marked, and it is understood that, while they form no part of the above- 
described books of the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress, they are iu 
other respects to be treated iu accordance with the above regulations. No book or 
chart belonging to the Smithsonian Institution is exempt from them unless procured 
for the specific use of the Secretary, Assistant Secretary, or assistant in charge of 
the Smithsonian, as above designated, and distinctly stamped as belonging to his 
oiiice. Under this clause come books ptirchased especially for the office of' the 
Secretary, Assistant Secretary, or assistant in charge, forming ''ofiSce libraries." 
Indispensable books of reference in exchange departments, etc., form jiart of the 
Chief Clerk's oflicc library. 

This is to be understood as including the books purchased at the expense of the 
Museum appropriation, but not necessarily the books obtained by exchange for 
Museum publications, as it would be difficult, if not impossible, always to discrimi- 
nate these under our present system. This point is reserved for future consideration, 
but provisionally it is understood that the librarian is to send books to the Library 
of Congress, if not evidently meant for the Museum. 

The books ^n-ovided for the. office of the Secretary, and stamped " Secretary's 
library," are a distinct class, having no relation to the Library of Congress or to the 
sectional libraries. They may be lent on application iu special cases by the Assist- 
ant Secretary or assistant in charge through the librarian. All other books (not 
forming a portion of the Smithsonian deposit with the Library of Congress, but 
belonging to the Institution) are stamped "Office library," which includes editor's 
library. Chief Clerk's office library, and others, and these, as well as those of the 
Secretary's library, are in the charge of the librarian. 

Respectfully submitted. 

Cyrus Adler, Lihrarian. 

Mr. S. P. Langley, 

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENERAL APPENDIX 



TO THE 



SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1894. 



ADVERTISEMENT. 



The object of the General Appendix to the Aiinnal Report of the 
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discov- 
ery in particuhir directions; reports of investigations made by collab- 
orators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character or on 
special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous correspond- 
ents of the Institution. 

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report 
required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more remarka- 
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery, 
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti- 
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history, 
been carried out largely by the publication of such i^apers as would 
possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress. 

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of 
an annual summary of j)rogress which for thirty years previous had 
been issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by 
competent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the 
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology, 
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and 
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether 
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888. 

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of 
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original) 
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus- 
sion. This method has been continued in the present report, for 1894.

O^ THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 



By William Haekness. 



Nature may be studied in two widely different Avays. On the one 
hand we may employ a powerful microscope which will render visible 
the minutest forms and limit our field of view to an infinitesimal frac- 
tion of an inch situated within a foot of our own noses ; or, on the other 
hand, we may occupy some commanding position, and from thence, 
aided j)erhaj)s by a telescope, we may obtain a comprehensive view of 
an extensive region. The first method is that of the specialist, the 
second is that of the i^hilosopher, but both are necessary for an ade- 
quate understanding of nature. The one has brought us knowledge 
wherewith to defend ourselves against bacteria and microbes, which 
are among the most deadly enemies of mankind, and the other has made 
us acquainted with the great laws of matter and force uijou which rests 
the whole fabric of science. All nature is one, but for convenience of 
classification we have divided our knowledge into a number of sciences 
which we usually regard as quite distinct from each other. Along cer- 
tain lines, or, more properly, in certain regions, these sciences neces- 
sarily abut on each other, and just there lies the weakness of the 
specialist. He is like a wayfarer who always finds obstacles in cross- 
ing the boundaries between two countries, while to the traveler who 
gazes over them from a commanding eminence the case is quite differ- 
ent. If the boundary is an ocean shore, there is no mistaking it; if a 
broad river or a chain of mountains, it is still distinct; but if only a 
line of posts traced over hill and dale, then it becomes lost in the 
natural features of the landscape, and the essential unity of the whole 
region is apparent. In that case the border land is wholly a human 
conception of which nature takes no cognizance, and so it is with the 
scientific border land to which I x>ropose to invite your attention this 
evening. 

To the popular mind there are no two sciences farther apart than 
astronomy and geology. The one treats of the structure and mineral

constitution of our earth, tlie causes of its physical features and its 
history, while the other treats of the celestial bodies, their magnitudes, 
motions, distauces, jieriods of revolution, eclipses, order, and of the 
causes of their various phenomena. And yet, many, perhaps I may 
even say most, of the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies are 
merely retlectious of the motions of the earth, and in studying them 
we are really studying it. Furthermore, precession, nutation, and the 
phenomena of the tides depend largely upon the internal structure of 
the earth, and there astronomy and geology merge into each otlier. 
Nevertheless, the meth'ods of the two sciences are widely diftei-ent, 
most astronomical problems being discussed quantitatively by means 
of rigid mathematical formuhe, while in the vast majority of cases the 
geological ones are discussed only qiuilitatively, each author contenting 
himself with a mere statement of what he thinks. With precise data 
the methods of astronomy lead to very exact results, for mathematics 
is a mill which grinds exceeding tine; but, after all, what comes out of 
a mill depends wholly upon what is put into it, and if the data are 
uncertain, as is the case in most cosmological problems, there is little 
to choose between the mathematics of the astronomer and the guesses 
of the geologist. 

If we examine the addresses delivered by former j)residents of this 
association, and of the sister — perhaps it would be nearer the truth to 
say the inir^nt — association on the other side of the Atlantic, avc shall 
Hud that they have generally dealt either with the recent advances 
in some broad field of science, or else Avith the development of some 
special subject. This evening 1 propose to adopt the latter course, and 
I shall invite your attention to the present condition of our knowledge 
respecting the nuignitude of the solar system; but in so doing it will be 
necessary to introduce some considerations derived from laboratory 
experiments upon the luminiferous ether, others derived from exi)eri- 
ments upon ponderable matter, and still others relating both to the 
surface i^henomena and to the internal structure of the earth, and thus 
we shall deal largely with the border land where astronomy, i)hysics, 
and geijlogy merge into each other. 

The relative distauces of the various bodies which compose the solar 
system can be determined to a considerable degree of approximation 
with very crude instruments as soon as the true plan of the system 
becomes known, and that plan was taught by Pythagoras more than 
five hundred years before Christ. It must have been known to the 
Egyptians and Chaldeans still earlier, if Pythagoras really acquired 
his knowledge of astronomy from them, as is- affirmed by some of the 
ancient writers, but on that point there is no certainty. In public 
Pythagoras seemingly accepted the current belief of his time, which 
made the earth the center of the universe, but to his own chosen disci- 
ples he communicated the true doctrine that the sun occupies the center 
of the solar system and that the earth is only one of the planets revoly-

ing around it. Like all the world's greatest sages, lie seems to have 
taught ouly orally. A century elapsed before his doctrines were reduced 
to writing by Philolaus of Crotona, and it was still later before they 
were taught in public for the first time by Ilicetas, or as he is sometimes 
called Nicetas, of Syracuse. Then the familiar cry of impiety was 
raised, and the Pythagorean system was eventually suppressed by that 
now called the Ptolemaic, which held the field until it was overthrown 
by Copernicus almost two thousand years later. Pliny tells us that 
Pythagoras believed the distances to the sun and moon to be, res])ec- 
tively, 252,000 and 12,600 stadia, or, taking the stadium at 025 feet, 
29,837 and 1,492 English miles; but there is no record of the method 
by which these numbers were ascertained. 

After the relative distances of the various planets are known, it only 
remains to determine the scale of the system, for which purpose the 
distance between any two planets sufiQces. We know little about the 
early history of the subject, but it is clear that the primitive astrono- 
mers must have found the quantities to be measured too small for 
detection with their instruments, and even in modern times the prob- 
lem has proved to be an extremely difticult one. Aristarchus, of 
Samos, who flourished about 270 B. C, seems to have been the first to 
attack it in a scientific manner. Stated in modem language, his rea- 
soning was that when the moon is exa(;tly half full the earth and 
sun, as seen from its center, must make a right angle with each other, 
and by measuring the angle between the sun and moon, as seen from 
the earth at that instant, all the angles of the triangle joining the 
earth, sun, and moon would become known, and thus the ratio of the 
distance of the sun to the distance of the moon would be determined. 
Although perfectly correct in theory, the difticulty of deciding visually 
upon the exact instance when the moon is half full is so great that it 
can not be accurately done, even with the most powerful telescoijes. 
Of course Aristarchus had no telescope, and he does not explain how 
he ett'ected the observation, but his conclusion was that at the instant 
in question the distance between the centers of the sun and moon as 
seen from the earth is less than a right angle by one-thirtieth irM't 
of the same. We should now express this by saying that the angle is 
87°, but Aristarchus knew nothing of trigonometry, and in order to 
solve his triangle he had recourse to an ingenious, but long and cum- 
bersome, geometrical process, which has come down to us, and afibrds 
conclusive proof of the condition of Greek mathematics at that time. 
His conclusion was that the sun is nineteen times farther fr<mi the earth 
than the moon, and if we combine that result with the modern value of 
the moon's parallax, viz, 3,122.38", we obtain for the solar parallax 
180", which is more than twenty times too great. 

The only other method of determining the solar parallax known to 
the ancients was that devised by Hipparchus about 150 B. C. It was 
based on measuring the rate of decrease of the diameter of the earth's 



96 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 

shadow cone by noting the duration of lunar eclipses, and as the result 
deduced from it happened to be nearly the same as that found by Aris- 
tarchus, substantially his value of the parallax remained in vogue for 
nearly two thousand years, and the discovery of the telescope was 
required to reveal its erroneous character. Doubtless this persistency 
was due to the extreme minuteness of the true parallax, which we now 
know is far too small to have been visible upou the ancient instru- 
ments, and thus the supposed measures of it were really nothing but 
measures of their inaccuracy. 

The telescope was first jioiuted to the heavens by Galileo in 1009, but 
it needed a micrometer to convert it into an accurate measuring instru- 
ment, and tliat did not come into being until 1639, when it was invented 
by William Gascoigue. After his death, in 1644, his original instru- 
ment passed to Kichard Townley, who attached it to a 14-foot telescope 
at his residence in Townley, Lancashire, England, where it was used 
by Flamsteed in observing the diurnal parallax of Mars during its 
opposition in 1672. A description of Gascoigne's micrometer was pub- 
lished in the Philosophical Transactions in 1667, and a little before 
that a similar instrument had been invented by Auzout, in France, but 
observatories were fewer then than now, and, so far as 1 know, J. D. 
Cassini was the only person beside Flamsteed who attempted to deter- 
mine the solar parallax from that opposition of Mars. Foreseeing the 
importance of the opportunity, he had llicher dispatched to Cayenne 
some months i)reviously, and when the opposition came he effected two 
determinations of the parallax 5 one being by the diurnal method, from 
his own observ^atious in Paris, and the other by the meridian method, 
from observations in France by himself, Komer, and Picard, combined 
with those of llicher at Cayenne. This was the transition from the 
ancient instruments with open sights to telescopes armed with microm- 
eters, and the result must have been little short of stunning to the 
seventeenth century astronomers, tor it caused the hoary and gigantic 
parallax of about 180" to shrink incontinently to 10", and thus ex- 
panded their conception of the solar system to something like its true 
dimensions. More than fifty years previously Kepler had argued from 
his ideas of the celestial harmonies that the solar parallax could not 
exceed 60", and a little later Horrocks had shown on more scientific 
grounds that it was probably as small as 14"; but the final death blow 
to the ancient values — ranging as high as 2' or 3' — came from these 
observations of Mars by Flamsteed, Cassini, and Richer. 

Of course the results obtained in 1672 produced a keen desire on the 
part of astronomers for further evidence respecting the true value of 
the parallax, and as Mars comes into a favorable position for such 
investigations only at intervals of about sixteen years, they had recourse 
to observations of Mercuiy and Venus. In 1677 Halley observed the 
diurnal parallax of Mercury, and also a transit of that planet across 



ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 97 

the sun's disk, at St. Helena, aud in 1681 J. D. Cassini and Picard 
observed Venus when she was on the same parallel with the sun, but 
although the observations of Venus gave better results than those of 
Mercury, neither of them was conclusive, and we now know that such 
methods are inaccurate even with the powerful instruments of the pres- 
ent day. Nevertheless Halley's attempt by means of the transit of 
Mercury ultimately bore fruit in the shape of his celebrated paper of 
1710, wherein he showed the peculiar advantages of transits of Venus 
for determining the solar parallax. The idea of utilizing such tran- 
sits for this purpose seems to have been vaguely conceived by James 
Gregory, or perhaps even by Horrocks, but Halley was the first to 
work it out completely, and long after his death his paper was mainly 
instrumental in inducing the Governments of Europe to undertake the 
observations of the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769, from which our 
first accurate knowledge of the sun's distance was obtained. 

Those who are not familiar with practical astronomy may wonder 
why the solar parallax can be got from Mars and Venus, but not from 
]\Iercury or the sun itself. The explanation depends upon two facts. 
Firstly, the nearest approach of these bodies to the earth is for Mars 
33,874,000 miles, for Venus 23,654,000 miles, for Mercury 47,935,000 
miles, and for the sun 91,239,000 miles. Consequently, for us Mars and 
Venus have very nuich larger jjarallaxes than Mercury or the sun, and 
of course the larger the parallax the easier it is to measure. Secondly, 
even the largest of these parallaxes must be determined within far less 
than one-tenth of a second of the truth, and while that degree of accu- 
racy is possible in measuring short arcs, it is quite unattainable in long 
ones. Hence, one of the most essential conditions for the successful 
measurement of parallaxes is that we shall be able to comj^are the 
place of the near body with that of a more distant one situated in the 
same region of the sky. In the case of Mars that can always be done 
by making use of a neighboring star, but when Venus is near the earth 
slie is also so close to the sun that stars are not available, and conse- 
quently her parallax can be satisfactorily measured only when her 
position can be accurately referred to that of the sun, or, in other words, 
only during her transits across the sun's disk. But even when the two 
bodies to be comi>ared are sufficiently near each other, we are still 
embarrassed by the fact that it is more difficult to measure the dis- 
tance between the limb of a planet and a star or the limb of the sun 
than it is to measure the distance between two stars, and since the dis- 
covery of so many asteroids that circumstance has led to their use 
for the determination of the solar parallax. Some of these bodies 
approach within 75,230,000 miles of the earth's orbit, and as they look 
precisely like stars, the increased accuracy of pointing on them fully 
makes uj) for their greater distance as compared with Mars or Venus. 

After the Oopernican system of the world and the Newtonian theory 
of gravitation were accepted it soon became evident that trigouomet- 
SM94 7

rical measurements of the solar parallax might be supplemented by 
deteruiiaations based on the theory of gravitation, and the tirst attempts 
ill that direction were made by Machin in 1729 and T. Mayer in 1753. 
The measurement of the velocity of lightbetween points on the earth's 
surface, first effected by Fizeau in 1849, opened up still other possibili- 
ties, and thus for determining the solar parallax we have at our com- 
mand no less than three entirely distinct classes of methods, which are 
known resi>ectively as the trigonometrical, the gravitational, and the 
photo-tachymetrical. We have already given a summary sketch of 
the trigonometrical methods as applied by the ancient astronomers 
to the dichotomy and shadow cone of the moon, and by the moderns to 
Venus, Mars, and the asteroids, and we shall next glance briefly at the 
giavitational and i)hoto-tachymetrical methods. 

The gravitational results which enter directly or indirectly into the 
solar parallax are six in number, to wit: First, the relation of the moon's 
mass to the tides; second, the relation of the moon's mass and parallax 
to the force of gravity at the earth's surface; third, the relation of the 
solar parallax to the masses of the earth and moon; fourth, the rela- 
tion of the solar and lunar parallaxes to the moon's mass and parallac- 
tic inequality; fifth, the relation of the solar and lunar parallaxes to 
the moon's mass and the earth's lunar inequality; sixth, the relation of 
the constants of nutation and precession to the moon's parallax. 

Respecting the first of these relations it is to be remarked that the 
tide-producing forces are the attractions of the sun and moon upon the 
w^aters of the ocean, and from the ratio of these attractions the moon's 
mass can readily be determined. But unfortunately the ratio of the 
solar tides to the lunar tides is affected both by the dei)th of the sea 
and by the character of the channels through which the water flows, 
and for that reason the observed ratio of these tides requires multipli- 
cation by a correcting factor in order to convert it into the ratio of the 
forces. The matter is further complicated by this correcting factor 
varying from port to port, and in order to get satisfactory results long- 
series of observations are necessary. The labor of deriving the moon's 
mass in this way was formerly so great that for more than half a cen 
tury Laplace's determination from the tides at Brest remained unique; 
but the recent a]»plication of harmonic analysis to tlie data sup]dicd 
by self-registering tide gauges is likely to yield abundant results in 
the near future. 

Our second gravitational relation, viz, that connecting the moon's 
mass and parallax with the force of gravity at the earth's surface, 
aftbrds an indirect method of determining the moon's parallax witli 
very great accuracy if the computation is carefully made, and with a 
fair approximation to the truth even when the data are exceedingly 
crude. To illustrate this, let us see what could be done with a railroad 
transit such as is commonly used by surveyors, a steel tape, and a fairly 
good watch. Neglecting small corrections due to the flattening of the

earth, tlie oeutrit'iigal force at its surface, the eccentricity of its orbit 
and the mass of the moon, the hiw of gravitation sliows that if we 
nuiltiply together the lengtli of the seconds pendulum, the square of 
the radius of the earth, and tlie square of the length of the sidereal 
month, divide the product by four, and take the cube root of the quo- 
tient, the result will be the distance from the earth to the moon. To 
tiiid the length of the seconds pendulum we would rate the watch by 
means of the railroad transit, and then making a pendulum out of a 
spherical leaden bullet suspended by a fine thread, we would adjust tiie 
length of the thread until the pendulum made exactly three hundred 
vibrations in tive minutes by the watch. Then, supposing the experi- 
ment to be made here or in ISTew York City, we would find that the 
distance from the point of suspension of the thread to the center of the 
bullet was about 39 J inches, and dividing that by the number of inches 
in a mile, viz, G3,3G0, we would have for the length of the seconds pen- 
dulum one sixteen hundred and twentieth of a mile. The next step 
would be to ascertain the radius of the earth, and the quickest way 
of doing so would probably be, first, to deternune the latitude of some 
point in New York City by means of the railroad transit; next to run 
a traverse survey along the old x>ost-road from New York to Albany, 
and finally to determine the latitude of some point in Albany. The 
traverse survey should surely be correct to one part in three hundred, 
and as the distance between the two cities is about 2° the diflerenee 
of latitude might be determined to about the same percentage of 
accuracy. In that way Ave would find the length of 2° of latitude to 
be about 138 miles, whence the earth's radius would be 3,953 miles. It 
would then only remain to observe the time occupied by the moon in 
making a sideieal revolution around the earth, or, in other words, the 
time which she occupies in moving from any given star back to the same 
star again. By noting that to within one-quarter of her own diameter 
we would soon find that the tune of revolution is about 27.32 days, and 
multii)lying that by the number of seconds in a day, viz, 86,400, we 
would have for the length of the sidereal month 2,3(50,000 seconds. 
With these data the computation would stand as follows: The radius 
of the earth, 3,953 miles, multiplied by the length of a sidereal month, 
2,300,000 seconds, and the i)roduct squared gives 87,000,000,000,000,- 
000,000. IMultiplyiug that by one-fourth of the length of the seconds 
pendulum, viz, one sixty-four hundred and eightieth of a mile, and 
extracting the cube root of the product, we would get 237,700 miles 
for the distance from the earth to the moon, which is only about 850 
miles less than the truth, and certainly a remarkable result consider- 
ing the crudeness of the instruments by which it might be obtained. 
Nevertheless, when all the conditions are rigorously taken into account 
these data are to be regarded as determining the relation between the 
moon's mass and parallax, rather than the parallax itself. . 



100 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 

Our third gravitational relation, to wit, that existing between the 
solar parallax, the solar attractive force, and the masses of the earth 
and moon, is analogous to the relation existing between the moon's 
mass and parallax and the force of gravity at the earth's surface, but 
it can not be applied in exactly the same way on account of our inability 
to swing a pendulum on the sun. We are therefore compelled toado])t 
some other method of determining the sun's attractive force, and the 
most available is that which consists in observing the perturbative 
action of the earth and moon upon our nearest planetary neighbors — 
Venus and Mars. From this action the law of gravitation enables us 
to determine the ratio of the sun's mass to the combined masses of the 
earth and moon, and then the relation in question furnishes a means of 
comparing the masses so found with trigonometrical determinations of 
the solar parallax. Thus it appears that notwithstanding necessary 
ditferences in the methods of i^rocedure, the analogy between the sec- 
ond and third gravitational relations holds not only with respect to 
their theoretical basis, but also in their practical application, the one 
being used to determine the relation between the mass of the moon and 
its distance from the earth, and the other to determine the relation 
between the combined masses of the earth and moon and their distance 
from the sun. 

Our fourth gravitational relation deals with the connection between 
the solar i^arallax, the lunar parallax, tlie moon's mass, and the moon's 
parallactic inequality. The important quantities are here the solar 
parallax and the moon's parallactic inequality, and although the deriva- 
tion of the conqdete expression for the connection between them is a 
little complicated, there is no dititiculty in getting a general notion of 
the forces involved. As the moon moves around the earth she is alter- 
nately without and within the earth's orbit. When she is without, the 
sun's attraction on her acts with that of the earth; when she is within, 
the two attractions act in opposite directions. Thus in effect the cen- 
tripetal force holding the moon to the earth is alternately increased and 
diminished, with the result of elongating the moon's orbit toward the 
sun and conq)ressing it on the opposite side. As the variation of the 
centripetal force is not great, the change of form of the orbit is small; 
nevertheless, the summation of the minute alterations thereby produced 
in the moon's orbital velocity suffices to put her sometimes ahead and 
sometimes behind her mean i)lace to an extent which oscillates from a 
maximum to a minimum, as the earth passes from perihelion to aphelion, 
and averages about 125" of arc. This perturbation of the moon is 
known as the parallactic inequality, because it dejiends on the earth's 
distance from the sun, and can therefore be expressed in terms of the 
solar parallax. Conversely, the solar parallax can be deduced from the 
observed value of the jjarallactic inequality, but unfortunately there 
are great practical difficulties in making the requisite observations with 
a suliicieut degree of accuracy. Notwithstanding the ever-recurring

talk about the advantages to be obtained by observing a small, well- 
defined crater instead of the moon's limb, astronomers have hitherto 
found it impracticable to use anything but the limb, and the disadvan- 
tage of doing so, as compared with observing a star, is still further 
increased by the circumstance that in general only one limb can be seen 
at a time, the other being shrouded in darkness. If both limbs could 
always be observed we should then have a uniform system of data for 
determining the ])lace of the center, but under existing circumstances 
we are compelled to make our observations half upon <>ne limb and half 
upon the other, and thus they involve all the systematic errors which 
may arise from the conditions under which these limbs are observed, and 
all the uncertainty which attaches to irradiation, personal eipiatiou, 
and our defective knowledge of the moon's semidiameter. 

Our fifth gravitational relation is that which exists between the solar 
parallax, the lunar parallax, the moon's mass, and the earth's lunar ine- 
quality. Strictly speaking the moon does not revolve around the earth's 
center, but both bodies revolve around the common center of gravity 
of the two. In consequence of that an irregularity arises in the earth's 
orbital velocity around the sun, the common center of gravity moving 
in accordance with the laws of elliptic motion, while the earth, on 
account of its revolution around that center, undergoes an alternate 
acceleration and retardation which has for its period a lunar month, 
and is called the lunar inequality of the earth's motion. We perceive 
this inequality as an oscillation superposed on the elliptic motion of 
the sun, and its semiamplitude is the measure of tlie angle subtended 
at the sun by the interval between the center of the earth and the 
common center of gravity of the earth and moon. Just as an astron- 
omer on the moon might use the radius of her orbit around the earth 
as a base for measuring her distance from the sun, so we may use this 
interval for the same purjiose. We find its length in miles from the 
equatorial semidiameter of the earth, the moon's parallax, and the 
moon's mass, and thus we have all the data for determining the solar 
parallax from the inequality in question. In view of the great diffi- 
culty which has been experienced in measuring the solar parallax itself, 
it may be asked, W^hy we should attempt to deal with the parallactic 
inequality, which is about 26 per cent smaller "? The answer is, liecause 
the latter is derived from differences of the sun's right ascension, 
which are furnished by the principal observatories in vast numbers, 
and should give very accurate results on account of their being made 
by methods which insure freedom from constant errors. Fevertlieless, 
the sun is not so well adapted for precise observations as the stars, 
and Dr. Gill has recently found that heliometer measurements upon 
asteroids which approach very near to the earth yield values of the 
parallactic inequality superior to those obtained from right ascensions 
of the sun. 

Our sixth gravitational relation is that which exists between the 
moon's parallax and the constants of precession and nutation. Every 



102 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 

particle of tlie earth is attracted both by the sun and by the moon, bnt 
in conseqnence of the poUir flattening- the resultant of these attractions 
passes a little to one side of the earth's center of gravity. Thus a 
couple is set up, which, by its action upon the rotating earth, causes 
the axis thereof to describe a surface which may be called a fluted cone, 
with its apex at the earth's center. A top spinning with its axis 
inclined describes a similar cone, except that the flutings are absent 
and the apex is at the point upon which the spinning occurs. For con- 
venience of computation we resolve this action into two components, 
and we name that which produces the cone the luni-solar precession, 
and that which produces the flutings the nutation. In this i>lienomenon 
the i)art played by the sun is comparatively small, and by eliminating 
it we obtain a relation between the luni solar precession, the nutation, 
and the moon's parallax which can be used to verify and correct the 
observed values of these quantities. 

In the preceding paragraph we have seen that the relation between 
the quantities there considered depends largely ui>oii tlie flattening of 
tlie earth, and thus we are led to inquire how and with wliat degree 
of accuracy that is determined. There are five methods — viz, one geo- 
detic, one gravitational, and three astronomical. The geodetic method 
depends upon measurements of the length of a degree on various parts 
of the earth's surface; and with the data hitherto accumulated it lias 
proved quite unsatisfactory. The gravitational method consists in 
determining the length of the seconds pendulum over as great a range 
of latitude as possible, and deducing therefrom the ratio of the earth's 
polar and equatorial semidiameters by means of Clairaut's theorem. 
The pendulum experiments show that the earth's crust is less dense on 
mountain plateaus than at the seacoast, and thus for the first time we 
are brought into contact with geological considerations. The first 
astronomical nu'thod consists in observing tlie moon's i)arallax from 
various points on the earth's surface; and as these parallaxes are noth- 
ing else than the angular semidiameter of the eartli at tlie respective 
points, as seen from the moon, they afford a direct measure of the flat- 
tening. The second and third astronomical methods are based upon 
certain perturbatn^ns of the moon which depend upon the figure of the 
earth, and should give extremely accurate results; but unfortunately 
very great difliculties oppose themselves to the exact measurenuMit of 
the i^erturbations. There is also an astronomico-geological method 
which can not yet be regarded as conclusive on account of our lack of 
knowledge respecting the law of density which prevails in the interior 
of the earth. It is based upon the fact that a certain function of the 
earth's moments of inertia can be determined from the observed values 
of the coetticients of precession and nutation, and could also be deter- 
mined from the figure and dimensions of the earth if we knew the exact 
distribution of matter in its interior. Our present knowledge on that 
subject is limited to a superficial layer not more than 10 miles thick. 



ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 103 

but it is usual to assume that the deeper matter is distributed, accord- 
ing to Lagrange's law, and then by writing the function in question in a 
form which leaves the flattening indeterminate, and equating the expres- 
sion so found to the value given by the precession and nutation, we 
readily obtain the flattening. As yet these methods do not give con- 
sistent results, and so long as serious discrepancies remain between 
them there can be no security that we have arrived at the truth. 

It should be remarked that in order to comi^ute the function of the 
earth's moments of inertia which we have just been considering, we 
require not only the figure and dimensions of the earth and the law of 
distribution of density in its interior, but also its mean and surface 
densities. The experiments for determining the mean density have 
consisted in comi)aring the earth's attraction with the attraction either 
of a mountain or of a known thickness of the earth's crust or of a 
known mass of metal. In the case of mountains the comparisons have 
been made with plumb lines and pendulums; in the case of known 
layers of the earth's crust they have been made by swinging pendu- 
lums at the surface and down in mines; and in the (;ase of known 
masses of metal they have been made with torsion balances, fine chem- 
ical balances, and pendulums. The surface density results from a study 
of the materials composing the earth's crust, but notwithstanding the 
api)arent simplicity of that process it is doubtful if we have yet 
attained as accurate a result as in the case of the mean density. 

Before quitting this part of our subject it is important to i)oint out 
that the luni-solar i^recession can not be directly observed, but must be 
derived from the general precession. The former of these qualities 
depends only upon the action of the sun and moon, while the latter is 
affected in addition by the action of all the planets, and to ascertain 
what that is we must determine their masses. The methods of doing 
so fall into two great classes, according as the planets dealt with have 
or have not satellites. The most favorable case is that in which one or 
more satellites are present, because the mass of the primary follows 
immediately from their distances and revolution times; but even then 
there is a difiticulty in the way of obtaining very exact results. By 
extending the observations over sufficiently long periods the revolution 
times may be ascertained with any desired degree of accuracy; but all 
measurements of the distance of a satellite from its primarj- are 
affected by personal equation, which we can not be sure of completely 
eliminating, and thus a considerable margin of uncertainty is brought 
into the masses. In the cases of Mercury and Venus, which have no 
satellites, and to a certain extent in the case of the earth also, the only 
available way of ascertaining the masses is from the perturbations 
produced by the action of the various planets on each other. These 
l^erturbations are of two kinds, j)eriodic and secular. When sufficient 
data have been accumulated for the exact determination of the secular 
pertnrbatioriS they will give the best results, but as yet it remains 
advantageous to employ the periodic perturbations also. 



104 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 

Passing now to tlie plioto-tacliymetrical methods, we bave first to 
glance briefly at the mechanical appliances by which the tremendous 
velocity of light has been successfully measured. They are of the sim- 
plest possible character, and are based either upon a toothed wheel or 
upon a revolving mirror. 

The toothed-wheel method was first used by Fizeau, in 1849. To 
understand its operation, imagine a gun barrel with a toothed wheel 
revolving at right angles to its muzzle in such a way that the barrel is 
alternately closed and opened as the teeth and the spaces between them 
pass before it. Then, with the wheel in rapid motion, at the instant 
when a sjiace is opposite the uuizzle let a ball be fired. It will pass out 
freely, and after traversing a certain distance let it strike an elastic 
cushion and be reflected back upon its own path. When it reaches the 
wheel, if it hits a space it will return into the gun barrel, but if it hits 
a tooth it will be stopped. Examining the matter a little more closely 
we see that, as the ball requires a certain time to go and return, if 
during tliat time the wheel moves through an odd multiple of the angle 
between a space and a tooth the ball will be stopped, while if it moves 
through an even multiple of that angle the ball will return into the 
barrel. !Now imagine the gun barrel, the ball, and the elastic cushion to 
be replaced, respectively, by a telescope, a light wave, and a mirror. 
Then if the wheel moved at such a speed that the returning light wave 
struck against the tooth following the space through which it issued, to 
an eye looking into the telescope all would be darkness. If the wheel 
moved a little faster and the returning light wave passed through the 
space succeeding that through which it issued, the eye at the telescope 
would perceive a flash of light, and if the speed was continuously 
increased a continual succession of eclii)ses and illuminations would 
follow each other according as the returning light was stopped against 
a tooth or passed through a space farther and farther behind that 
through which it issued. Under these conditions the time occupied by 
the light in traversing the space from the wheel to the mirror and back 
again would evidently be the same as the time required by the wheel 
to revolve through the angle between the space through which the light 
issued and that through which it returned, and thus the velocity of 
light would become known from the distance between the telescope and 
the mirror, together with the speed of the wheel. Of course the longer 
the distance traversed and the greater the velocity of the wheel the 
more accurate Avould be the result. 

The revolving-mirror method was first used by Foucault in 1862. 
Conceive the toothed wheel of Fizeau's apparatus to be replaced by a 
mirror attached to a vertical axis and capable of being put into rapid 
rotation. Then it will be possible so to arrange the apparatus that 
light issuing from the telescope shall strike the movable mirror and be 
reflected to the distant jnirror, whence it will be returned to the mov- 
able mirror again, and being thrown back into the telescope will appear 



ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 105 

as a star in the center of the flekl of view. That adjustment being 
made, if the mirror were caused to revolve at a speed of some hundred 
turns per second it would move through an appreciable angle while the 
light was passing from it to the distant mirror and back again, and in 
accordance with the laws of reflection, the star in the field of the tele- 
scope would move from the center by twice the angle through which 
the mirror had turned. Thus the deviation of the star from the center 
of the field would measure the angle through which the mirror turned 
during the time occupied by light in passing twice over the interval 
between the fixed and revolving mirrors, and from the magnitude of 
that angle, together with the known speed of the mirror, the velocity 
of the light could be calculated. 

In applying either of these methods the resulting velocity is that of 
light when traversing the earth's atmosi)here, but what we want is its 
velocity in space, which we suppose to be destitute of ponderable 
material, and in order to obtain that the velocity in the atmosphere 
must be multiplied by the refractive index of air. The correct velocity 
so obtained can then be used to find the solar parallax, either from the 
time required by light to traverse the semidiameter of the earth's orbit, 
or from the ratio of the velocity of light to the orbital velocity of the 
earth. 

Any periodic correction which occurs in computing the place of a 
heavenly body or the time of a celestial phenomenon is called by 
astronomers an equation, and as the time required by light to traverse 
the semidiameter of the earth's orbit first i^resented itself in the guise of 
a correction to the computed times of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, 
it has received the name of the light equation. The earth's orbit being 
interior to that of Jupiter, and both having the sun for their center, it 
is evident that the distances between the two planets must vary from 
the sum to the diflerence of the radii of their respective orbits, and the 
time required by light to travel from one planet to the other must vary 
proportionately. Consequently, if the observed times of the eclipses 
of Jupiter's satellites are compared with the times computed upon the 
assumption that the two planets are always separated by their mean 
distance, it will be found that the eclipses occur too early when the 
earth is at less than its niean distance from Jupiter, and too late when 
it is farther oft", and from large numbers of such observations the value 
of the light equation has been deduced. 

The combination of the motion of light through our atmosphere with 
the orbital motion of the earth gives rise to the annual aberration, all 
the jihases of which are comj^uted from its maximum value, commonly 
called the constant of aberration. There is also a diurnal aberration 
due to the rotation of the earth on its axis, but that is quite small and 
does not concern us this evening. When aberration was discovered 
the corpuscular theory of light was in vogue, and it ottered a charm- 
ingly simxile explanation of the whole phenomenon. The hypothetical 



106 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 

light corpuscles impinging upon the earth were thought to behave pre- 
cisely like tlie drops in a shower of rain, and you all know that their 
apparent direction is affected by any motion on the part of the observer. 
In a calm day, when the drops are falling perpendicularly, a man stand- 
ing still holds his umbrella directly over his head, but as soon as he 
begins to move forward he inclines his umbrella in the same direction, 
and the more rapidly he moves the greater must be its inclination in 
order to meet tlie descending shower. Similarly, the apparent direc- 
tion of oncoming light corpuscles would be affected by the orbital 
motion of the earth, so that in effect it would always be the resultant 
arising from combining the motion of the light with a motion equal and 
opposite to that of the earth. But since the falsity of the corpuscular 
theory has been proved that explanation is no longer tenable, and as 
yet we have not been able to replace it with anything equally satis- 
factory based on the now universally accepted undulatory theory. In 
accordance with the latter theory we must conceive the eartli as plow- 
ing its way through the ether, and the point which has hitherto baffled 
us is whether or not in so doing it produces any disturbance of the ether 
which affects the aberration. In our present ignorance on that point 
we can only say that the aberration constant is certainly very nearly 
equal to the ratio of the earth's orbital velocity to the velocity of light, 
but we can not affirm that it is rigorously so. 

The luminiferous ether was invented to account for the phenomena 
of light, and for two hundred years it was not suspected of having any 
other function. The emission theory postulated only the corpuscles 
which constitute light itself, but the undulatory theory tills all space 
with an imponderable substance jjossessing properties even more 
remarkable than those of ordinary matter, and to some of the acutest 
intellects the magnitude of this idea has proved an almost insuperable 
objection against the whole theory, So late as 1862 Sir David Brews- 
ter, who had gained a world-wide reputation by his optical researches, 
expressed himself as staggered by the notion of filling all space with 
some substance merely to enable a little twinkling star to send its 
light to us; but not long after Clerk Maxwell removed that difficulty 
by a discovery coextensive with the undulatory theory itself. Since 
18-t5, when Faraday first performed his celebrated experiment of mag- 
netizing a ray of light, the idea that electricity is a phenomenon of the 
ether had been steadily growing, until at last Maxwell perceived that 
if such were the fact the rate of proi)agation of an electro-magnetic 
wave must be the same as the velocity of light. At that time no one 
knew how to generate such waves, but Maxwell's theory showed him 
that their velocity must be equal to the number of electric units of 
quantity in the electro-magnet unit, and careful experiments soon proved 
that that is the velocity of light. Thus it was put almost beyond the 
I^ossibility of doubt that the ether gives rise to the phenomena of elec- 
tricity and magnetism as well as to those of light, and perhaps it may 



ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 107 

even be concerned in the prodnction of gravitation itself. What could 
be apparently more remote than these electric quantities and the solar 
parallax? And yet we have here a relation between them, but we 
make no use of it because as yet the same relation can be far more 
accurately determined from experiments upou the velocity of light. 

]^ow, let us recall the quantities and methods of observation which 
we have found to be involved, either directly or indirectly, with the 
solar parallax. They are, the solar i>arallax, obtained from transits of 
Venus, oppositions of Mars, and oppositions of certain asteroids; the 
lunar parallax, found both directly and from measurements of the force 
of gravity at the earth's surface; the constants of preceSvSion, nutation, 
and aberration, obtained from observations of the stars; the parallac- 
tic inequality of the moon; the lunar inequality of the earth, usually 
obtained from observations of tlie sun, but recently found from heli- 
ometer observations of certain asteroids; the mass of the earth, found 
from the solar iiarallax and also from the periodic and secular pertur- 
bations of Venus and Mars; the mass of the moon, found from the 
lunar inequality of the earth and also from the ratio of the solar and 
lunar components of tbe ocean tides; the masses of all the planets, 
obtained from observations of their satellites whenever possible, and 
when no satellites exist, then from observations of their mutual pertur- 
bations, both i^eriodic and secular; the velocity of light, obtained from 
experiments with revolving mirrors and toothed wiieels, together with 
laboratory determinations of the index of refraction of atmospheric 
air; the light equation, obtained from observations of the eclipses of 
Jupiter's satellites; the figure of the earth, obtained from geodetic 
tri angulations, measurements of the length of the seconds pendulum 
in various latitudes, and observations of certain perturbations of the 
moon; the mean density of the earth, obtained from measurements of 
the attractions of mountains, from pendulum experiments in mines, 
and from experiments on the attraction of known masses of matter 
made either with torsion balances or with the most delicate chemical 
balances; the surface density of the earth, obtained from geological 
examinations of the surface strata; and, lastly, the law of distribution 
of density in the interior of the earth, which in the present state of 
geological knowledge we can do little more tlian guess at. 

Here, then, we have a large group of astronomical, geodetic, geological 
and physical quantities which must all be considered in finding- the 
solar parallax, and which are all so entangled with each other that no 
one of them can be varied without aft'ecting all the rest. It is there- 
fore impossible to make an accurate determination of any one of tbem 
apart from the remainder of the group, and thus we are driven to the 
conclusion that they must all be determined simultaneously. Such has 
not been the practice of astronomers in the past, but it is the method 
to which they must inevitably resort in the future. A cursory glance 
at an analogous problem occurring in geodesy may be instructive. 



108 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 

When a country is covered with a net of triangles it is always found 
that the observed angles are subject to a certain amount of error, aud 
a century ago it was the habit to correct the angles in each triangle 
without much regard to the effect upon adjacent triangles. Conse- 
quently the adjustment of the errors was imperfect, and in computing 
the interval between any two distant points the result would vary some- 
what with the triangles used in tlie computation — that is, if one compu- 
tation was made through a chain of triangles running around on the 
right-hand side, another through a chain of triangles running straight 
between the two points, and a third through a chain of triangles run- 
ning around on the left-hand side, the results were usually all different. 
At that time things were less highly specialized than now, and all geo- 
detic operations were yet in the hands of first-rate astronomers, who 
soon devised processes for overcoming the difiBculty. They imagined 
every observed angle to be subject to a small correction, and as these 
corrections were all entangled with each other through the geometrical 
conditions of the net, by a most ingenious application of the method of 
least squares they determined them all simultaneously in such a way as 
to satisfy the whole of the geometrical conditions. Thus the best possi- 
ble adjustment was obtained, and no matter what triangles were used 
in passing from one point to another, the result was always the same. 
That method is now applied to every important triangulation, and its 
omission would be regarded as proof of incompetency on the iiart of 
those in charge of the work. 

Now let us compare the conditions existing respectively in a trian- 
gulation net and in the group of quantities for the determination of the 
solar parallax. In the net every angle is subject to a small correction, 
and the whole system of corrections must be so determined as to make 
the sum of their weighted squares a minimum and at the same time 
satisfy all the geometrical conditions of the net. Like the triangles, 
the quantities composing the group from which the solar parallax must 
be determined are all subject to error, and therefore we must regard 
each of them as requiring a small correction, and all these corrections 
must be so determaied as to make the sum of their weighted squares a 
minimum, and at the same time satisfy every one of the equations 
expressing the relations between tlie various (•om])onents of the group. 

Thus it appears that the method required for adjusting the solar par- 
allax and its related constants is in all respects the same as that which 
has so long been used for adjusting systems of triangulation, and as 
the latter method was invented by astronomers, it is natural to incjuire 
Why have they not applied it to the fundamental problem of their own 
science? The reasons are various, but they may all be classed under 
two heads: First, an inveterate habit of overestimating the accuracy 
of our own work as comx^ared with that of others; and second, the 
unfortunate effect of too much specialization. 



ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 109 

The prevailiug opinion certainly is tliat great advances have recently 
been made in astronomy, and so they have in the fields of spectral 
analj^sis and in the measnreraent of minute quantities of radiant heat; 
but the solution of the vast majority of astronomical problems depends 
upou the exact measurement of angles, and in that little or no progress 
has been made. Bradley, Avith his zenith sector a hundred and fifty 
years ago, and Bessel and Struve, with their circles and transit instru- 
ments seventy years ago, made observations not sensibly inferior to 
those of the present day, and indeed it would have been surprising if 
they had not done so. The essentials for accurately determining star 
places are a skilled observer, a clock, and a transit circle, the latter 
consisting of a telescope, a divided circle, and four micrometer micro- 
scopes. Surely no one will claim that we have to-day any more skillful 
observers than were Bessel, Bradley, and Struve, and the only way in 
which we have improved upon the telescopes made by Dolloud one 
hundred and thirty years ago is by increasing their aperture and rela- 
tively diminishing their focal distance. The most famous dividing 
engine now in existence was made by the elder Repsold seventy-five 
years ago; but as the errors of divided circles and their micrometer 
microscopes are always carefully determined, the accuracy of the meas- 
ured angles is quite independent of any small improvement in the 
accuracy of the divisions or of the micrometer screws. Only in the 
matter of clocks has there been some advance, and even that is not 
very great. On the whole, the star places of to-day are a little better 
than those of seventy-five years ago, but even yet there is great room 
for improvement. One of the commonest api:)lications of these star 
places is to the determination of latitude, but it is very doubtful if 
there is any point on the face of the earth whose latitude is known 
certainly within one-tentb of a second. 

Looking at the question from another point of view, it is notorious 
that the contact observations of the transits of Venus in 17(51 and 1769 
were so discordant that from the same observations Encke and B. J. 
Stone got respectively for the solar parallax 8.59" and 8.91". In 1870 
no one thought it possible that there could be any difficulty with the 
contact observations of the then approaching transits of 1874: and 1882, 
but we have found from sad experience that our vaunted modern instru- 
ments gave very little better results for the last pair of transits than 
our predecessors obtained with much cruder appliances in 1761 and 1769. 

The theory of probability and uniform experience alike show that the 
limit of accuracy attainable with any instrument is soon rea(;hed; and 
yet we all know the fascination which continually lures us on in our 
efforts to get better results out of the familiar telescopes and circles 
which have constituted the standard equipment of observatories for 
nearly a century. Possibly these instruments may be capable of indi- 
cating somewhat smaller quantities than we have hitherto succeeded 



110 ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 

in measuring with them, but their limit can not be far oft', because they 
already show the disturbing ettects of slight inequalities of temperature 
and other uncontrollable causes. So far as these effects are accidental 
they eliminate themselves from every long series of observations, but 
there always remains a residuum of constant error, perhaps quite 
unsuspected, which gives us no end of trouble. Encke's value of the 
solar parallax aftbrds a fine illustration .of this. From the transits of 
Venus in 1701 and 1769 he found 8.58" in 1821, which he subsequently 
corrected to 8.57", and for thirty years that value was universally 
accepted. The first objection to it came from Hansen in 1854, a second 
followed from Leverrier in 1858, both based ui)on facts connected with 
the lunar theory, and eventually it became evident that Encke's parallax 
was about one-fourth of a second too small. 

Now please observe that Encke's value was obtained trigonometric- 
ally, and its inaccuracy was never suspected until it was revealed by 
gravitational methods, which were themselves in error about one-tenth 
of a second and required subsequent correction in other ways. Here, 
then, was a lesson to astronomers, who are all more or less specialists, 
but it merely enforced the perfectly well-known principle. that the con- 
stant errors of any one method are accidental errors w^ith respect to all 
other methods, and therefore the readiest way of eliminating them is 
by combining the results from as many different methods as possible. 
However, the abler the specialist the more certain he is to be blind to 
all methods but his own, and astronomers have profited so little by the 
Encke-Hansen-Leverrier incident of thirty-five years ago that to-day 
they are mostly divided into two great parties, one of whom holds that 
the parallax can be best determined from a combination of the constant 
of aberration with the velocity of light and the other believes only in 
the results of heliometer measurements upon asteroids. By all means 
continue the heliometer measurements and do everything possible to 
clear up the mystery which now surrounds the constant of aberration, 
but why ignore the work of predecessors who were quite as able as 
ourselves? If it were desired to determine some one angle of a triangu- 
lation net with special exactness, what would be thought of a man who 
attempted to do so by repeated measurements of the angle in question 
while he persistently neglected to adjust the net? And yet until 
very recently astronomers have been doing precisely that kind of 
thing with the solar parallax. I do not think there is any exaggeration 
in saying that the trustworthy observations now on record for the 
determination of the numerous quantities which are functions of the 
parallax could not be duplicated by the most industrious astronomer 
working continuously for a thousand years. How, then, can we suppose 
that the result properly deducible from them can be materially affected 
by anything that any of us can do in a lifetime unless we are fortunate 
enough to invent methods of measurement vastly superior to any 



ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. Ill 

hitherto imagined? Probably the existing observations for the deter- 
mination of most of these quantities are as exact as any that can ever 
be made with our present instruments, and if they were freed from 
constant errors they woukl certainly give results very near the truth. 
To that end we have only to form a system of simultaneous equations 
between all the observed (j[uantities and then deduce the most probable 
values of these quantities by the method of least squares. Perhaps 
some of you may think that the value so obtained for the solar parallax 
would depend largely upon the relative weights assigned to the various 
quantities, but such is not the case. With almost any possible system 
of weights the solar parallax will come out very nearly 8.809" ± 0.0057", 
whence we have for the mean distance between the earth and the sun 
92,797,000 miles, with a probable error of only 59,700 miles; and for 
the diameter of the solar system, measured to its outermost member, 
the planet Neptune, 5,578,400,000 miles. 



SCHIAPARELLI'S LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS.' 



By William II. riCKERiNG. 



It is ])robable that the astronomer whose name is most closely linked 
witli the planet Mars at the present time is Giovanni Schiaparelli ; 
and yet, although nearly everybody has heard of Schiaparelli's canals, 
very few astronomers even, outside of France and Italy, had until 
recently more than a very vague notion what were really his ideas in 
regard to them. This is due probably to the fact that he has written 
exclusively in Italian, a language which very few American astrono- 
mers, and I believe very few English ones, understand. To this fact 
chiefly, I think, is due the great incredulity with which his observa- 
tions have been treated, at leavSt until recently, in both of these coun- 
tries. Astronomers could understand his maps; they knew, therefore, 
wliat he had done, but they could not understand his descriptions of 
his observations, and so were incredulous regarding their accuracy. 
Moreover, such a mass of detail appeared upon his maps, which had 
not before been seen by others, that it comi)letely masked the more 
striking features of the planet, thus rendering its appearance entirely 
ditferent from that which it presented in the telescope under ordinary 
atmospheric conditions. 

But within the last few years a change has occurred. Flammarion 
has translated a large part of Schiaparelli's writings into French, a 
language with which most English speaking astronomers are familiar, 
and moreover the canals have been seen by a number of astronomers 
whose descriptions of them in English and French could be under- 
stood and were found to agree with those of Schiaparelli. 

But errors are still frequently made by people who might be expected 
to know better. Thus, many people suppose that Schiaparelli was the 
original discoverer of the canals, a claim which he never made for him- 
self. In point of fact, some of them appear upon maps of the planet 
published more than fifty years ago. The former English incredulity 
in the matter seems the more strange, since many of the canals were 
seen by Dawes in 1864 and by Burton and Dreyer in 1879. Schia- 
parelli, however, has discovered far more canals than anyone else, and 
he is also the discoverer of their gemination.

114 SCHIAPARELLI'S LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. 

In this connection it may be that a brief chronological statement of 
the more important facts and discoveries relating to Mars will not be 
without interest. In compiling it I have been chiefly indebted to Flam- 
marion's classic work, La Planete Mars, although other sources have 
also been consulted. 

272 B. C. The first known observation of Mars is recorded in Ptol- 
emy's Almagest. 

1010 A. D. The phases of Mars were discovered by Galileo. 

1059, The first sketch showing surface detail was made by Huy- 
gens. He also suggested a rotation in twenty-four hours. 

1000. Cassini determined the rotation of Mars to take place in 
twenty-tour hours and forty minutes. He also observed the polar caps, 
and "he distinguished on the disk of Mars, near the terminator, a 
white spot advancing into the dark portion, and representing, without 
doubt, like those of the moon, a roughness or irregularity of the sur- 
face." This latter statement is curious, but the effect was undoubtedly 
due to irradiation, since his telescope was entirely inadequate to enable 
him to observe such a delicate phenomenon. 

1777. With the exception of Huygens, Hooke, and possibly Maraldi, 
no one succeeded in making recognizable sketches of the surface detail 
upon Mars for over a century, until Sir William Ilerschel took the mat- 
ter up in this year. 

1783. Sir William Ilerschel detected the variation of the size of the 
polar snowcai)S with the seasons, measured the polar compression, and 
determined the inclination of the axis of the planet to its orbit. 

1785-1802. Schroeter made an extended study of the planet. His 
drawings are upon the whole rather better than those of Herschel. He 
discovered, among other things, the very dark spots to which I have 
referred in my publications as the Northern and Equatorial Seas. He, 
however, supposed them to be clouds. 

1810. Beer and Maedler publislied the first map of the planet, assign- 
ing latitudes and longitudes to the various markings. On this map are 
indicated the first canals and the first of the small lakes, so many of 
which have been discovered during the last few years. The canals are 
Nectar and Agathoda^mon and portions of Hades and Tartarus. The 
lake is Lacus Phcenicis. Their map is the first- satisfactory represen- 
tation of the entire surface of the i>lanet. The only region which pre- 
.vious observers had clearly distinguished was that in the vicinity of 
tlie Syrtis Major. 

1858. Secchi made a careful study of the colors exhibited by the 
planet. 

1802. Lockyer made the first series of really good sketches of the 
planet, showing all the characteristic forms with which we are now so 
familiar. His drawings, and also those of some of the other observers, 
give the first indications of the appearance of the central branch in 
the Y, so called by Secchi.

1864. Dawes detected eight or ten of the canals. 

1867. Hiiggins detected lines due to the presence of water vapor in 
the spectrum of Mars. 

1867. Proctor determined the period of rotation of Mars within 0.1 
second. 

1877. Hall discovered the two satellites of Mars. 

1877. Green made a very excellent series of drawings of the planet, 
superior to anything which had preceded them. 

1877. Schiaparelli made the first extensive triangulation of the sur- 
face of the planet, and added very largely to the number of known 
canals. 

1879. Schiaparelli detected the gemination of Nilus, the first known 
double canal. 

1882. Schiaparelli discovered numerous double canals, and announced 
that the appearance formed one of the characteristic phenomena of the 
planet. 

The most reliable confirmation of this phenomenon hitherto reported 
has come from Perrotin, of Nice, and A. Stanley Williams, in England. 
If Schiaparelli's theory is correct, that the duplication occurs only 
between the spring and autumn equinoxes of the Northern Hemisphere, 
the last opportunity to witness it was in 1890, and the next will be iu 
January and February of 1895, unless the planet proves to be too 
remote at that period. 

Very few of Schiaparelli's writings have ever been translated into 
English, and none so far as I know, hitherto, without the intervention 
of some other language, such as German or French. The following 
translation is from Natura ed Arte for February 15, 1893. It gives 
the latest expression of his views upon the periodical inundations expe- 
rienced by the planet, upon the nature of the seas, the canals, and the 
gemination of the latter.

THE planet mars. 



By Giovanni Schiaparelli. 



Many of the first astronomers who studied Mars with the telescope 
had noted on the outline of its disk two brilliant white spots of rounded 
form and of variable size. In process of time it was observed that 
while the ordinary spots upon Mars were displaced rapidly in conse- 
quence of its daily rotation, changing in a few hours both their posi- 
tion and their perspective^ the two white spots remained sensibly 
motionless at their posts. It was concluded rightly from this that 



116 SCHIAPARELLl's LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. 

they must occupy the poles of rotation of the phiuet, or at least must 
be fouud very uear to them. Consequently they were given the name 
of polar caps or spots. And not without reason is it conjectured that 
these represent upon Mars that immense mass of snow and ice which 
still to-day prevents mivigators from reaching the poles of the earth. 
We are led to this conclusion not only by the analogy of aspect and of 
place, but also by another important observation. - - - 

As things stand, it is manifest that if the above mentioned white 
polar spots of Mars represent snow and ice they should continue to 
decrease in size with the approach of summer in those places and 
increase during the winter. Now this very fact is observed in the 
most evident manner. In the second half of the year 181»2 the south- 
ern polar cap was in full view; during that interval, and especially in 
the months of July and August, its rapid dimimition fiom week to week 
was very evident even to those observing with common telescopes. 
This snow (for we may well call it so), which in the beginning reached 
as fiir as latitude 70^ and formed a cap of over 2,000 kilometers (1,L*00 
miles) in diameter, progressively diminished, so that two or three months 
later little more of it remained than an area of perhaps 300 kilometers 
(180 miles) at the most, and still less was seen in the last days of 1802. 
In these months the southern hemisphere of Mars had its summer, 
the summer solstice occurring upon October 13. Correspondingly the 
mass of snow surrounding the northern pole should have increased; 
but this fact was not observable, since that pole was situated in the 
hemisphere of Mars which was opposite to that facing the earth. The 
melting of the northern snow was seen in its turn in the years 1882, 
1884, and 1886. 

Theseobservationsof the alternate increase and decreaseof the i)olar 
snows are easily made even with telescopes of moderate power, but 
they become much more interesting and instructive when we can follow 
assiduously the changes in their more minute particulars, using larger 
instruments. The snowy regions are then seen to be successively 
notched at their edges; black holes and huge fissures are formed in 
their interiors; great isolated pieces many miles in extent stand out 
from the i)rincipal mass and, dissolving, disappear a little later. In 
short, the same divisions and movements of these icy fields present 
themselves to us at a glance that occur during the summer of our own 
arctic regions, according to the descriptions of explorers. 

The southern snow, however, presents this peculiarity: The center 
of its irregularly rounded figure does not coincide exactly with the pole, 
but is situated at another point, which is nearly always the same, and 
is distant from the pole about 300 kilometers (180 miles) in the direc- 
tion of the Mare Erythricum. From this Ave conclude that when the 
area of the snow is reduced to its smallest extent the south pole of 
Mars is uncovered, and therefore, ])erhaps, the problem of reaching 
it upon this planet is easier than upon the earth. The southern snow 



SCHIAPARELLl's LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. 117 

is in the midst of a hu.iie dark sj)ot, wbicli with its branches occupies 
nearly onethird of the whole surface of Mars, and is sn])posed to repre- 
sent its principal ocean. Hence the analogy with our arctic and 
antarctic snows may be said to be complete, and especially so with the 
antarctic one. 

The mass of the northern snow cap of Mars is, on the other hand, 
centered almost exactly upon its pole. It is located in a region of 
yellow color, which we are accustomed to consider as representing the 
continent of the planet. From this arises a singular phenomenon which 
has no analogy upon the earth. At the melting of the snows accumu- 
lated at that pole during the long night of ten months and more the 
liquid mass produced in that operation is diffused around the circum- 
ference of the snowy region, converting a large zone of surrounding 
land into a temporary sea and filling all the lower regions. This pro- 
duces a gigantic inundation, which has led some observers to suppose 
the existence of another ocean in those parts, but which does not really 
exist in that place, at least as a permanent sea. We see then (the last 
opportunity was in 1884) the white spot of the snow surrounded by a 
dark zone, which follows its perimeter in its progressive diminution, 
upon a circumference ever more and more narrow. The outer part of 
this zone branches out into dark lines, which occupy all the surround- 
ing region, and seem to be distributary canals by which the liquid 
mass may return to its natural position. This produces in these regions 
very extensive lakes, such as that designated upon the map by the name 
of Lacus Hyperboreus ; the neighboring interior sea called Mare Acida- 
liuin becomes more black and more conspicuous. And it is to be 
remembered as a very probable thing that the flowing of this melted 
snow is the cause which determines principally the hydrographic state 
of the planet and the variations that are periodically observed in its 
aspect. Something similar would be seen upon the earth if one of our 
poles came to be located suddenly in the center of Asia or of Africa. 
As things stand at present, we may find a miniature image of these 
conditions in the flooding that is observed in our streams at the melt- 
ing of the Alpine snows. 

Travelers in the arctic regions have frequent occasion to observe how 
the state of the polar ice at the beginning of the summer, and even at 
the beginning of July, is always very unfavorable to their progress. 
The best season for exploration is in the month of August, and Sep- 
tember is the month in which the trouble from the ice is the least. 
Thus in September our Alps are usually more practicable than at any 
other season. And the reason for it is clear — the melting of the snow 
reffuires time; a high temperature is not sufficient; it is necessary that 
it should continue, and its efl'ecr, will be so much the greater, as it is 
the more prolonged. Thus, if we could slow down the course of our 
season so that each month should last sixty days instead of thirty, in 
the summer, in such a lengthened condition, the melting of the ice 



118 SCHIAPARELLl's LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. 

would progress luiicli further, and perhaps it would not be an exagger- 
ation to say that the polar cap at the end of the warm season would 
be entirely destroyed. But one can not doubt, in any case, that the 
fixed i^ortiou of such a cap would be reduced to much smaller size, than 
we see it to-day. Now, this is exactly what happens on Mars. The 
long year, nearly double our own, permits the ice to accumulate during 
the polar night of ten or twelve months, so as to descend in the form of 
a continuous layer as far as parallel 70°, or even farther. But in the 
day which follows, of twelve or ten months, the sun has time to melt 
all, or nearly all, of the snow of recent formation, reducing it to such a 
small area that it seems to us no more than a very white point. And 
perhaps this snow is entirely destroyed; but of this there is at present 
no satisfactory observation. 

Other white spots of a transitory character and of a less regular 
arrangement are formed in the southern hemisphere upon the islands 
near the pole, and also in the opposite hemisphere whitish regions 
aj^pear at times surrounding the north pole and reaching to 50° and 
55° of latitude. They are, perhaps, transitory snows, similar to those 
which are observed in our latitudes. But also in the torrid zone of 
Mars are seen some very small white spots more or less j)ersistent; 
among others one was seen by me in three consecutive oppositions 
(1877-1882) at the point indicated upon our chart by longitude 2G8° 
and latitude ir>° north. Perhaps we may be permitted to imagine in 
this place the existence of a mountain capalde of supporting extensive 
ice fields. The existence of such a mountain has also been suggested 
by some recent observers upon other grounds. 

As has been stated, the polar snows of Mars i^rove in an incontro- 
vertible manner that this planet, like the earth, is surrounded by an 
atmosphere capable of transporting vapor from one place to anotlier. 
Tliese snows are in fact precipitations of vapor, condensed by the cold, 
and carried with it successively. How carried with it if not by atmos- 
pheric movement? The existence of an atmosphere charged with 
vapor has been confirmed also by spectroscopic observations, princi- 
pally those of Vogel, according to which this atmosphere must be of a 
composition differing little from our own, and, above all, very rich in 
aqueous vapor. This is a fact of the highest importance, because from 
it we can rightly affirm with much probability that to water and to no 
other liquid is due the seas of Mars and its polar snows. When this 
conclusion is assured beyond all doubt, another one may be derived 
from it of not less importance — that the temperature of the Arean cli- 
mate, notwithstanding the greater distance of that planet from the 
sun, is of the same order as the temperature of the terrestrial one. 
Because, if it were true, as has been supposed by some investigators, 
that the temj)erature of Mars was on the average very low (from 50° 
to G0° below zero), it would not be possible for water vapor to be an 
important element in the atmosphere of that planet, nor could water 



SCHIAPARELLl'S LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. 119 

be an importaut factor iu its physical changes, but would give place 
to carbonic acid, or to some other liquid whose freezing point was 
much lower. 

The elements of the meteorology of Mars seem, then, to have a close 
analogy to those of the earth. But there are not lacking, as might be 
expected, causes of dissimilarity. From circumstances of the smallest 
moment nature brings forth an infinite variety in its oj)erations. Of 
the greatest influence must be different arrangement of the seas and 
the continents upon Mars and upon the earth, regarding which a 
glance at the map will say more than would be possible in many words. 
We have already emphasized the fact of the extraordinary jjeriodical 
flood, which at every revolution of Mars inundates the northern polar 
region at the melting of the snow. Let us now add that this inun- 
dation is spread out to a great distance by means of a network of 
canals, i^erhaps constituting the principal mechanism (if not the only 
one) by which water (and with it organic life) may be diffused over 
the arid surface of the planet. Because on Mars it rains very rarely, 
or perhaps even it does not rain at all. And this is the proof. 

Let us carry ourselves in imagination into celestial space, to a point 
so distant from the earth that we may embrace it all at a single glance. 
He would be greatly in error who had exx^ected to see reproduced there 
upon a great scale the image of our continents with their gulfs and 
islands and with the seas that surround them which are seen upon our 
artiticial globes. Then without doubt the known forms or part of them 
would be seen to appear under a vaporous veil, but a great part (per- 
haps one-half) of the surface would be rendered invisible by the 
immense fields of cloud, continually varying in density, in form, and 
in extent. Such a hindrance, most frequent and continuous in the 
polar regions, would still impede nearly half the time the view of the 
tenij)erate zones, distributing itself in capricious and ever varying con- 
figurations. The seas of the torrid zone would be seen to be arranged 
in long parallel layers, corresj)Ouding to the zone of equatorial and 
tropical calms. For an- observer placed upon the moon the study of 
our geography would not be so simple an undertaking as one might at 
first imagine. 

There is nothing of this sort in Mars. In every climate and under 
every zone its atmosj)here is nearly perpetually clear and sufficiently 
transparent to permit one to recognize at any moment whatever the 
contours of the seas and continents and, more than that, even the minor 
configurations. Not indeed that vapors of a certain degree of opacity 
are lacking, but they offer very little impediment to the study of the 
topograx^hy of the x^lauet. Here and there we see ai^x^ear from time to 
time a few whitish spots, changing their x^osition and their form, rarely 
extending over a very wide area. Tliey frequent by x>reference a few 
regions, such as the islands of the Mare Australe, and on the conti- 
nents the regions designated on the max) with the names of Elysium 



120 SCHIAPARELLI'S LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. 

and Tempe. Their brilliaucy generally diminishes and disappears at 
the meridian hour of the i)lace, and is reenforced in the morning and 
evening with very marked variations. It is possible tliat they may be 
layers of cloud, because the upper portions of terrestrial clouds where 
they are illuminated by the sun appear white. But various observa- 
tions lead us to think that we are dealing rather with a thin veil of fog 
instead of a true nimbus cloud, carrying storms and rain. Indeed, it 
may be merely a temporary condensation of vapor under the form of 
dew or hoar frost. 

Accordingly, as ftir as we may be permitted to argue from the 
observed facts, the climate of Mars must resemble that of a clear day 
upon a high mountain. By day a very strong solar radiation, hardly 
mitigated at all by mist or vapor; by night a copious radiation from the 
soil toward celestial space, and because of that a very marked refriger- 
ation. Hence a climate of extremes, and great changes of temperature 
from day to night, and from one season to another. And as ou the 
earth at altitudes of 5,000 and 0,000 meters (17,000 to L'0,000 feet) the 
vapor of the atmosphere is condensed only into the solid form, produc- 
ing those whitish masses of suspended crystals which we call cirrus 
clouds, so in the atmosphere of Mars it would be rarely possible (or 
would even be impossible) to find collections of cloud capable of pro- 
ducing rain of any consequence. The variation of the temperature 
from one season to another would be notably increased by their long 
duration, and thus we can understand the great freezing and melting 
of the snow, which is renewed in turn at the poles at each complete 
revolution of the planet around the sun. 

As our chart demonstrates, in its general topograpliy Mars does not 
present any analogy with the earth. A third of its surface is occupied 
by the great Mare Australe, which is strewn with many islands, and 
the continents are cut up by gulfs and ramifications of various forms. 
To the general water system belongs an entire series of small internal 
seas, of which the Iladriacum and the Tyrrhenum communicate with it 
by wide mouths, whilst the Cimmerium, tlie Sirenum, and the Solis 
Lacus are connected with it only by means of narrow canals. We shall 
notice in the first four a parallel arrangement, which certainly is not 
accidental, as also not without reason is the corresponding position of 
the peninsulas of Ausonia, Ilesperia, and Atlantis. The color of the 
seas of Mars is generally brown, mixed with gray, but not always of 
equal intensity in all places, nor is it the same in the same place at all 
times. From an absolute black it may descend to a light- gray or to an 
ash color. Such a diversity of colors may have its origin in various 
causes, and is not without analogy also upon the earth, where it is noted 
that the seas of the warm zone are usually much darker than those 
nearer the pole. The water of the Baltic, for example, has a light, 
muddy color that is not observed in the Mediterranean. And thus in 



SCHIAPARELLIS LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. 121 

the seas of Mars we see the color become darker when tlie sun approaches 
their zeuith, and summer begins to rule in tbat region. 

All of the remainder of the planet, as far as the north pole, is occu- 
pied bj' the mass of the continents, in which, save in a few areas of rel- 
atively small extent, an orange color predominates, which sometimes 
reaches a dark red tint, and in others descends to yellow and white. 
The variety in this coloring is in part of meteorological origin, in part 
it may depend on the diverse nature of the soil, but upon its real cause 
it is not as yet possible to frame any very well grounded hypothesis. 
Nevertheless, the cause of this predominance of the red and yellow 
tuits upon the surface of ancient Pyrois is well known. ^ Some have 
thought to attribute this coloring to the atmosphere of Mars, through 
which the surface of the planet might be seen colored, as any terres- 
trial object becomes red when seen through red glass. But many facts 
are o.pposed to this idea, among others that the polar snows appear 
always of the purest white, although the rays of light derived from 
them traverse twice the atmosphere of Mars under great obliquity. 
We must then conclude that the Arean continents appear red and 
yellow because they are so in fact. 

Besides these dark and light regions, which we have described as 
seas and continents, and of whose nature there is at present scarcely 
left any room for doubt, some others exist, truly of small extent, of an 
amphibious nature, which sometimes appear yellowish like the con- 
tinents, and are sometimes clothed in brown (even black in certain 
cases), and assume the appearance of seas, whilst in other cases their 
color is intermediate in tint, and leaves us in doubt to which class of 
regions they may belong. Thus all the islands scattered through the 
Mare Australe and the Mare Erythrteum belong to this category 5 so 
too the long peninsula called Deucalionis Kegio and Pyrrhfe Kegio, 
and in the vicinity of the Mare Acidalium the regions designated by 
the names of Baltia and Nerigos. The most natural idea, and the one 
to which we should be led by analogy, is to suppose these regions to 
represent huge swamjis, in which the variation in depth of the water 
produces the diversity of colors. Yellow Avould predominate in those 
parts where the depth of the liquid layer was reduced to little or 
nothing, and brown, more or less dark, in those places where the water 
was sufficiently deep to absorb more light and to render the bottom 
more or less invisible. That the water of the sea, or any other deep 
and transparent water, seen from above, api)ears more dark the greater 
the depth of the liquid stratum, and that the land in comparison with 
it appears bright under the solar illumination, is known and continued 
by certain iihysical reasons. The traveler in the Alps often has occa- 
sion to convince himself of it, seeing from the summits the deep lakes

with wliich the region is strewn extending under his feet as black as 
ink, whilst in contrast with them even the blackest rocks illuuiined by 
the sunlight appeared brilliant. ' 

Not without reason, then, have we hitherto attributed to the dark 
spots of Mars the part of seas, and that of continents to the reddish 
areas which occupy nearly two-thirds of all the planet, and we shall 
find later other reasons which confirm this method of reasoning. The 
continents form in the northern hemisphere a nearly continuous mass, 
the only important exception being the great lake called the Mare 
Acidalium, of which the extent may vary according to the time, and 
which is connected in some way with the inundations which we have 
said were produced by the melting of the snow surrounding the north 
pole. To the system of the Mare Acidalium undoubtedly belong the 
temporary lake called Lacus Hyperboreus and the Lacus i^iliacus. 
This last is ordinarily separated from the Mare Acidalium by means of 
an isthmus or regular dam, of which the continuity was only seen to 
be broken once for a short time in 1888. Other smaller dark spots are 
found here and there in the continental area which we may designate 
as lakes, but they are certainly not permanent lakes like ours, but are 
variable in appearance and size according to the seasons, to the point 
of wholly disappearing under certain circumstances. Ismenius Lacus, 
Lunic Lacus, Trivium Charoiitis, and Propontis are the most conspicu- 
ous and durable ones. There are also smaller ones, such as Lacus 
Moeris and Fons Juventoe, which at their maximum size do not exceed 
100 to 150 kilometers (GO to 90 miles) in diameter, and are among the 
most difficult objects upon tbe planet. 

All the vast extent of the continents is furrowed upon every side by 
a network of numerous lines or fine stripes of a more or less pro- 
nounced dark color, whose aspect is very variable. These traverse the 
planet for long distances in regular lines that do not at all resemble 
the winding courses of our streams. Some of the shorter ones do not 
reach 500 kilometers (300 miles), others, on the other hand, extend for 
many thousands, occupying a quarter or sometimes even a third of a 
circumference of the planet. Some of these are very easy to see, 
especially that one which is near the extreme left-hand limit of our 
map, and is designated by the name of Kilosyrtis. Others in turn are 
extremely difficult, and resemble the finest thread of spider's web 
drawn across the disk. They are subject also to great variations in 
their breadth, which may reach 200 or even 300 kilometers (120 to 
180 miles) for the Nilosyrtis, whilst some are scarcely 30 kilometers (18 
miles) broad. 

'This observation of the dark color which deep water exhibits when scon from 
above is fonnd already noted by the first author of antique memory, for in the 
Iliad (verses 770-771 of Book V) it is described how "the sentinel from the hiffh 
sentry box extends his glance over the wine-colored sea, olvoTra n6vTov." In the 
version of Monti the adjective indicating the color is lost. 



SCHIAPARELLl's LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. 123 

These lines or strijies are the famous canals of Mars, of wliicli so 
much has been said. As far as we have been able to observe them 
hitherto, they are certainly fixed configurations upon the planet. The 
Nilosyrtis has been seen in that place for nearly one hundred years, and 
some of the others for at least thirty years. Their length and arrange- 
ment are constant, or vary only between very narrow limits. Each of 
them always begins and ends between the same regions, lint their 
appearance and their degree of visibility vary greatly, for all of them, 
from one opposition to another, and even from one week to another, 
and these variations do not take place simultaneously and according to 
the same laws for all, but in most cases happen apparently capriciously, 
or at least according to laws not sufticiently simple for us to be able to 
unravel. Often one or more become indistinct, or ev^en wholly invisi- 
ble, whilst others in their vicinity increase to the point of becoming 
conspicuous even in telescopes of moderate power. The first of our 
maps shows all those that have been seen in a long series of observa 
tions. This does not at all corresiiond to the appearance of JNIars at any 
given period, because generally only a few are visible at once.' 

Every canal (for now we shall so call them) opens at its ends either 
into a sea, or into a lake, or into another canal, or else into the inter- 
section of several other canals. None of them have yet been seen cut 
off in the middle of the continent, remaining without beginning or 
without end. This fact is of the highest importance. The canals may 
intersect among themselves at all possible angles, but by preference 
they converge toward the small spots to which we have given the name 
of lakes. For example, seven are seen to converge in Lacus Phceuicis, 
eight in Trivium Charontis, six in Lume Lacus, and six in Ismenius 
Lacus. 

The normal appearance of a canal is that of a nearly uniform stripe, 
black, or at least of a dark color, similar to that of the seas, in which 
the regularity of its general course does not exclude small variations in 
its breadth and small sinuosities in its two sides. Often it happens 
that such a dark line opening out upon the sea is enlarged into the form 
of a trumpet, forming a huge bay, similar to the estuaries of certain 
terrestrial streams. The Margaritifer Sinus, the Aonius Sinus, the 

'Jn a footuote the author refers to a drawing of Mars made by himself, September 
15, 1892, and says, - - - " At tlio top of the disk the Mare Erythra-um aud the 
Mare Australe appear divided by a great curved peuiusiihi, shaped like a sickle, 
producing an unusual appearance in the area called Deucalionis Kegio, which was 
prolonged that year so as to reach the islands of Noachis and Argyre. This region 
forms with them a continuous whole, but with faint traces of separation occurring 
here and there in a length of nearly 6,000 kilometers (4,000 miles). Its color, much 
less brilliant than that of the continents, was a mixture of their yellow with the 
brownish gray of the neighboring seas." The interesting feature of this note is 
the remark that it was an unusual appearance, the region referred to being that in 
which the central branch of the fork of the Y appeared. Since no such branch was 
conspicuously visible this year, it would therefore seem from the above that it was 
the opposition of 1892 that was peculiar, and not the present one. — Translator. 



124 SCHIAPARELLI'S LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. 

Aurone Sinus, and tlietwo liorus of tlic Sabieus Sinus are tbus formed, 
at the mouths of one or more canals, opening' into tlie Mare Erythra-um 
or into the Mare Australe. The largest example of such a gulf is the 
Syrtis Major, formed by the vast mouth of the Nilosyrtis, so called. 
This gulf is not less than 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) iu breadth, and 
attains nearly the same dejith in a longitudinal direction. Its surftice 
is little less than that of the Bay of Bengal. In this case we see clearly 
the dark surface of the sea continued without apparent interruption 
into that of the canal. Inasmuch as the surfaces called seas are truly a 
liquid expanse, we can not doubt that the canals are a simple prolonga- 
tion of tliem, crossing the yellow areas or continents. 

Of the remainder, that the lines called canals are truly great furrows 
or depressions iu the surface of the planet, destined for the passage of 
the liquid mass and constituting for it a true hydrographic system, is 
demonstrated by the phenomena which are observed during the melt- 
ing of the northern snows. We have already remarked that at the 
time of melting they appeared surrounded by a dark zone, forming a 
species of temporary sea. At that time the canals of the surrounding 
region become blacker and wider, increasing to the point of convert- 
ing at a certain time all of the yellow region comprised between the 
edge of the snow and the i>arallel of (iO"^ north latitude into numerous 
islands of small extent. Such a state of things does not cease until the 
snow, reduced to its minimum area, ceases to melt. Then the breadth 
of the canals diminishes, the temporary sea disappears, and the yellow 
region again returns to its former area. The different i)hases of these 
vast phenomena are renewed at each return of the seasons, and we 
were able to observe them in all their particulars very easily during 
the oppositions of 1882, 1884, and 1880, when the planet presented its 
northern pole to terrestrial spectators. The most natural and the 
most simple interpretation is that to which we have referred, of a 
great inundation produced by the melting of the snows; it is entirely 
logical and is sustained by evident analogy with terrestrial phenomena. 
We conclude, therefore, that the canals are such in fact and not only 
in name. Tlie network formed by these was probably determined in 
its origin in the geological state of the planet, and has come to be 
slowly elaborated in the course of centuries. It is not necessary to 
suppose them the work of intelligent beings, and, notwithstanding tlie 
almost geometrical appearance of all of their system, we are now 
inclined to believe them to be produced by the evolution of the planet, 
just as on the earth we have the English Channel and the channel of 
Mozambique. 

It would be a problem not less curious than complicated and difficult 
to study the system of this immense stream of water, upou which per- 
haps depends principally the organic life upon the planet, if organic 
life is found there. The variations of their appearance demonstrated 
that this system is not constant. VVlieii they become displaced or 



SCniAPARELLl's LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. 125 

tbeir outlines become doubtful and ill defined, it is fair to suppose that 
the water is getting low or is even entirely dried up. Then, in place 
of the canals there remains either nothing or at most stripes of yellowish 
color differing little from the surrounding background. Sometimes 
they take on a nebulous ai)pearance, for which at i)resent it is not pos- 
sible to assign a reason. At other times true enlargements are produced, 
expanding to 100, 200 or more kilometers (60 to 120 miles) m breadth, 
and this sometimes happens for canals very far from the north pole, 
according to laws which are unknown. This occurred in Hydaspes 
in 1864, in Simois in 1879, in Ackeron in 1884, and in Triton in 1888. 
The diligent and minute study of the transformations of each canal 
may lead later to a knowledge of the causes of these efifcts. 

But the most surprising phenomenon pertaining to the canals of Mars 
is their gemination, which seems to occur principally in the months 
which prece<le and in those which follow the great northern inunda- 
tion — at about the times of the equinoxes. In consequence of a rapid 
process, which certainly lasts at most a few days, or even perhaps, 
only a few hours, and of which it has not yet been possible to determine 
the particulars with certainty, a given canal changes its appearance 
and is found transformed through all its length into two lines or uni- 
form stripes more or less parallel to one another, and which run straight 
and equal with the exact geometrical precision of the two rails of a rail- 
road. But this exact course is the only point of resemblance with the 
rails, because in dimensions there is no comparison possible, as it is 
easy to imagine. The two lines follow very nearly the direction of the 
original canal and end in the place where it ended. One of these is 
often superposed as exactly as possible upon the former line, the other 
being drawn anew; but in this case the original line loses all the small 
irregularities and curvature that it may have originally possessed. 
But it also happens that both the lines may occupy opposite sides of 
the former canal and be located upon entirely new ground. The dis- 
tance between the two lines differs in different geminations and varies 
from 600 kih)meters (360 miles) and more down to the smallest limit at 
which two lines may api)ear separated in large visual telescopes — less 
than an interval of 50 kilometers (30 miles). The breadth of the stripes 
themselves may range from the limit of visibility, which we may sup- 
pose to be 30 kilometers (18 miles), up to more than 100 kilometers (60 
miles). The color of the two lines varies from black to a light red, 
which can hardly be distinguished from the general yellow background 
of the continental surface. The space between is for the most part 
yellow, but in many cases appears whitish. The gemination is not nec- 
essarily confined only to the canals, but tends to be produced also in 
the lakes. Often one of these is seen transformed into two short, broad, 
dark lines parallel to one another and traversed by a yellow line. In 
these cases the gemination is naturally short and does not exceed the 
limits of the original lake. 



126 SCIIIAPARELLl's LATEST VIEWS REGARDING MARS. 

The gemination is not sliowu by all at the same time, but when the 
season is at hand it begins to be produeed here and there, in an isolated, 
irregular manner, or at least without any easily recognizable order. In 
many canals (such as the i^ilosyrtis, for example) the gemination is 
lacking entirely, or is scarcely visible. After having lasted for some 
months, the markings fade out gradually and disappear until another 
season equally favorable for their formation. Thus it happens that in 
certain other seasons (especially near the southern solstice of the 
planet) few are seen, or even none at all. In different oppositions the 
gemination of the same canal may present different appearances as to 
width, intensity, and arrangement of the two stripes; also in some 
cases the direction of the lines may vary, although by the smallest 
quantity, but vstill deviating by a small amount from the canal with 
which they are directly associated. From this important fact it is 
immediately understood that the gemination can not be a fixed forma- 
tion upon the surface of Mars and of a geographical eharacter like 
the canals. The second of our maps will give an approximate idea of 
the appearance which these singular formations present. It contains 
all the geminations observed since 1882 up to the present time. In 
examining it it is necessary to bear in mind that not all of these 
appearances were simultaneous, and consequently that the map does 
not represent the condition of Mars at any given period; it is only a 
sort of topographical register of the observations made of this phe- 
nomenon at different times.' 

The observation of the geminations is one of the greatest difficulty, 
and can only be made by an eye well practiced in such work, added to 
a telescoiDC of accurate construction and of great power. This explains 
why it is that it was not seen before 1882. In the ten years that have 
transpired since that time, it has been seen and described at eiglit or 
ten observatories. Nevertheless, some still deny tluit these i)henomena 
are real, and tax with illusion (or even imposture) those who declare 
that they have observed it. 

Their singular aspect, and their being drawn with absolute geomet- 
rical precision, as if they were the work of rule or compass, has led 
some to see in them the work of intelligent beings, inhabitants of the 
planet. I am very careful not to combat this supposition, which includes 
nothing impossible. (lo mi guardero bene dal combattere questa sup- 
posizione, la quale nulla include d' impossibile.) But it will be noticed 
that in any case the gemination can not be a work of i)ermanent charac- 
ter, it being certain that in a given instance it may change its ai)pearance 
and dimensions from one season to another. If we should assume such 
a work, a certain variability would not be excluded from it; for exam- 
ple, extensive agricultural labor and irrigation upon a large scale. Let 
us add, further, that the intervention of intelligent beings might ex]>lain

the geometrical appearance of tlie gemination, but it is not at all neces- 
sary for sucli a purpose. The geometry of nature is manifested in many 
other facts from wliicb are excluded tlie idea of any artificial labor 
whatever. The perfect spheroids of the heavenly bodies and the ring 
of Saturn were not constructed in a turning lathe, and not with com- 
passes has Iris described within the clouds her beautiful and regular 
arch. And what shall we say of the infinite variety of those exquisite 
and regular polyhedrons in which the world of crystals is so rich? In 
the organic world, also, is not that geometry most wonderful which 
presides over the distribution of the foliage upon certain j^lauts, which 
orders the nearly symmetrical, star-like figures of the flowers of the 
field, as well as of the animals of the sea, and which produces in the 
shell such an exquisits conical spiral that excels the most beautiful 
masterpieces of Gothic architecture? In all these objects the geomet- 
rical form is the simple and necessary consequence of the principles 
and laws which govern the physical and physiological world. That 
these principles and these laws are but an indication of a higher intel- 
ligent Power we may admit, but this has nothing to d© with the present 
argument. 

Having regard, then, for the principle that in the explanation of 
natural phenomena it is universally agreed to begin with the simplest 
suppositious, the first hypotheses of the nature and cause of the gemina- 
tions have for the most part put in operation only the laws of inorganic 
nature. Thus, the gemination is supposed to be due either to the eflects 
of light in the atmosphere of Mars, or to optical illusions produced by 
vapors in various manners, orto glacial phenomena of aperpetual winter, 
to which it is known all the planets will be condemned, or to double 
cracks in its surface, or to single cracks of which the images are doubled 
by the eflect of smoke issuing in long lines and blown laterally by the 
wind. The examination of these ingenious suppositions leads us to 
conclude that none of them seem to correspond entirely with the 
observed facts, either in whole or in pafrt. Some of these hypotheses 
would not have been proposed had their authors been able to examine 
the geminations with their own eyes. Since some of these may ask me 
directly. Can you suggest anything better? I must reply candidly, No. 

It would be far more easy if we were willing to introduce the forces 
pertaining to organic nature. Here the field of plausible supposition 
is immense, being capable of making an infinite number of combina- 
tions capable of satisfying the appearances even with the smallest and 
simplest means. Changes of vegetation over a vast area, and the pro- 
duction of animals, also very small, but in enormous multitudes, may 
well be rendered visible at suoh a distance. An observer placed in the 
moon would be able to see such an appearance at the times in which 
agricultural o])erations are carried out upon one vast plain — the seed- 
time and the gathering of the harvest. In such a manner also would 
the flowers of the plants of the great steppes of Europe and Asia be

rendered visible at the distance of Mars— by a variety of coloring. A 
similar system of operations produced in that planet may tlius certainly 
be rendered visible to ns. But liow difBcult for tlie Lunarians and tlie 
Areaus to be able to imagine tbe true causes of such changes of appear- 
ance without having first at least some superficial knowledge of terres- 
trial nature! So also for us, who know so little of the physical state 
of Mars, and nothing of its organic world, the great liberty of possible 
supposition renders arbitrary all explanations of this sort and consti- 
tutes the gravest obstacle to the acquisition of well-founded notions. 
All that we may hope is that with time the uncertainty of the problem 
will gradually diminish, demonstrating if not what the geminations 
are, at least what they can not be. We may also confide a little in 
what Galileo called "the courtesy of nature," thanks to which a ray 
of light from an unexpected source will sometimes illuminate an inves- 
tigation at first believed inaccessible to our speculations, and of which 
we have a beautiful example in celestial chemistry. Let us therefore 
hope and study. 



LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY, ACCORDING TO MAXWELL 

AND HERTZ.i 



By M. POINCARE.2 



It was at the moment when the experiments of Fresnel were lorcing 
the scientific workl to admit that hght consists of the vibrations of a 
highly attennated liuid filling interplanetary spaces that the researches 
of Ampere were making known the laws of the mntual action of cur- 
rents and were so enunciating the fundamental x)rinciples of electro- 
dynamics. 

It needed but one step to the supposition that that same fluid, the 
ether, which is the medium of luminous i)henomena, is at the same time 
the vehicle of electrical action. In imagination Ampere made this 
stride; but the illustrious i)hysicist could not foresee that the seducing 
hypothesis with which he was toying, a mere dream for him, was ere 
long to take a precise form and become one of the vital concerns of 
exact science. 

A dream it remained for many years, till one day, after electrical 
measurements had become extremely exact, some physicist, turning 
over the numerical data, much as a resting pedestrian might idly turn 
over a stone, brought to light an odd coincidence. It was that the 
factor of transformation between the system of electro statical units 
and the system of electro dynamical units was equal to the velocity 
of light. Soon the observations directed to this strange coincidence 
became so exact that no sane head could longer hold it a mere coinci- 
dence. No longer could it be doubted that some occult affinity existed 
between optical and electrical phenomena. Perhaps, however, we 
might be wondering to this day what this affinity could be were it not 
for the genius of Clerk Maxwell.

130 LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY. 



DISPLACEMENT CURRENTS. 

The reader is aware that solid bodies are divided into two classes, 
conductors tbrongli which electricity can move in the form of a galvanic 
current, and nonconductors, or dielectrics. The electricians of former 
days regarded dielectrics as quite inert, having no part to play but that 
of obstinately refusing passage to electricity. Had that been so, any 
one nonconductor might be replaced by any other without making any 
ditlerence in the phenomena; but Faraday found that that was not the 
case. Two condensers of the same form and dimensions put into con- 
nection with the same source of electricity do not take the same charge, 
though the thickness of the isolating plate be the same, unless the mat- 
ter of tliat plate be chemically the same. Now Clerk Maxwell had too 
deeply studied the researches of Faraday not to comi)rehend the import 
ance of dielectrics and the imjierati ve obligation to recognize their active 
l)art. 

r>esides, if light is but an electric phenomenon, when it traverses a 
thickness of glass electrical events must take place in tluit glass. And 
what can be the nature of those events? Maxwell boldly answers, 
they are, and must be, currents. 

All the experience of his day seemed to contradict this. Never had 
currents been observed except in conductors. How Avas Maxwell to 
reconcile his audacious hypothesis Avith a fact so well established as 
that? Why is it that under certain circumstances those supposed cur- 
rents produce manifest effects, Avhile under ordinary conditions they can 
not be observed at all. 

The answer was that dielectrics resist the passage of electricity not 
so much more than conductors do, but in a different manner. Maxwell's 
idea Avill best bo understood by a comi)arison. 

If we bend a spring, we meet a resistance which increases the more 
the spring is bendeil. So, if avc can only dispose of a finite force, a 
moment will come when the motion will cease, eciuilibrium being 
reached. Finally, when the force ceases the spring Avill in Hying back 
restore the whole of the energy which has been expended in bending it. 

Suppose, ou the other hand, that we wish to disjdace a body plunged 
into water. Here again a resistance Avill be experienced, but it Avill not 
go on increasing in proportion as the body advances, sui)X)Osing it to be 
maintained at a constant velocity. So long as the motive force acts, 
equilibrium will never, then, be attained ; nor when the force is removed 
Avill the body in the least tend to return, nor can any portion of the 
energy expended be restored. It will, in fact, have been converted into 
heat by the viscosity of the water. 

The contrast is plain; and we ought to distinguish elastic resistance 
from viscous resistance. Using these terms, we may express Maxwell's 
idea by saying that dielectrics otter an elastic resistance, conductors a 



LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY. 131 

viscous resistance, to the movements of electricity. Hence, there are two 
kinds of currents; currents of displacement Avhicli traverse dielectrics 
and ordinary currents of conduction which circulate in conductors. 

Currents of the first kind, having to overcome an elastic resistance 
which continually increases, naturally can last but a very short time, 
since a state of equilibrium will (juickly be reached. 

Currents of conduction, on the other hand, having only a viscous 
resistance to overcome, must continue so long so there is any electro- 
motive force. 

Let us return to the simile used by M. Coruu in his notice in the 
Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes for 1893. Suppose we have iu a 
reservoir water under pressure. Lead a tube plumb downward into the 
reservoir. The water will rise in the tube, but the rise will stop when 
hydrostatic equilibrium is attained — that is, when the downward pres- 
sure of the water in tlie tube above the i^oint of application of the first 
pressure on the reservoir, and due to the weight of the water, balances 
that first pressure. If the pipe is large, there will be no friction or 
loss of head, and the water so raised can be used to do work. That 
represents a current of displacement. 

If, on the other hand, the water flows out of the reservoir by a hori- 
zontal pipe, the motion will go on till the reservoir is emptied; but if 
the tube is small and long there will be a great loss of energy and con- 
siderable production of heat by friction. That represents a current of 
conduction. 

Though it would be vain, not to say idle, to attempt to represent all 
details, it may be said that everything happens just as if the currents 
of displacement were acting to beml a multitude of little springs. 
When the currents cease, electrostatic equilibrium is established, and 
the springs are bent the more, the more intense is the electric field. 
The accumulated work of the springs — that is, the electrostatic energy — 
can be entirely restored as soon as they can unbend, and so it is that 
we obtain mechanical work wlien we leave the conductors to obey the 
electrostatic attractions. Those attractions must be due to the pressure 
exercised on the conductors by the bent springs. Finally, to pursue 
the image to the death, the disruptive discharge may be compared to 
the breaking of the springs when they are bent too much. 

On the other hand, the energy employed to produce conduction cur- 
rents is lost, being wholly converted into heat, like that spent in over- 
coming the viscosity of fiuids. Hence it is that the conducting wires 
become heated. 

From Maxwell's point of view it seems that all currents are in closed 
circuits. The older electricians did not so opine. They regarded the 
current circulating in a wire joining the two poles of a pile as closed; 
but if ill place of directly uniting the two poles we place them in com- 
munication with the two armatures of a condenser, the momentary 
current which lasts while the condenser is getting charged was not

considered as a eiirreiit round a closed circuit. It went, tliey tliouglit, 
from one armature tlirougii tlie wire, the battery, the other wire, to the 
other armature, and there it stopped. Maxwell, on the contrary, sup- 
posed that in the form of a current of disi)lacement it ])asses through 
the nonconducting plate of the condenser, and that i)recisely what 
brings it to cessation is the opposite electrojuotive force set up by the 
displacement of electricity in this dielectric. 

Currents become sensible in three ways — by their heating effects, l)y 
their actions on other currents and on magnets, and by the induced 
currents to which they give rise. We have seen why currents of con- 
duction develop heat and why currents of displa<;ement do not. But 
Maxwell's hypothetical currents ought at any rate to ])roduce electro- 
magnetic and inductive effects. Why do these effects not appear? 
The answer is, that it is because a current of displacement can not last 
long enough. That is to say, they can not last long in one direction. 
Consequently in a dielectric no current can long exist without alterna- 
tion. But the effects ought to and will become observable if the current 
is continually reversed at sutticiently short intervals. 

THE NATURE OE LItlHT. 

Such, according to Maxwell, is the origin of light. A luminiferous 
wave is a series of alternating currents produced in dielectrics, in air, 
or even in the interi)]anetary void, and reversed in direction a million 
of millions of times per second. The enormous induction due to these 
frequent alternations sets up other currents in tiie neighboring i)arts 
of the dielectric, and so the waves are propagated. 

Calculation shows that the velocity of propagation would be equal 
to t.lie ratio of the units, which we know is the velocity of ligiit. 

Those alternative currents are a sort of electrical oscillation. Are 
they longitudinal, like those of sound, or are they transversal, like those 
of Fresnel's ether? In the (-ase of sound the air undergoes alteina- 
tive condensations and rarefactions. The ether of Fresnel, on the other 
hand, behaves as if it were composed of incompressible layers capable 
only of sli])piiig over one another. AVeie these currents in open patlis, 
the electricity carried from one eud to the other would become accu- 
mulated at one extremity. It would thus be condensed and rarefied 
like air, and its vibrations would be longitudinal. But Maxwell only 
admits currents in closed circuits; accumulation is im|»ossible, and 
electricity behaves like the incompressible ether of Fresnel, with its 
transversal vibrations. 

EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION. 

We thus obtain all the results of the theory of waves. Yet this 
was not enough to decide the i)hysicists to adopt the ideas of Max- 
well. It was a seductive hypothesis; but physicists consider hyjiotlie 
Bes which lead to no distinct observational conse(]ueuces as beyond 



LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY. 133 

the borders of their province. That province, so defined, no experi- 
mental confirmation of Maxwell's theory invaded for twenty-five years. 

What was wanted was some issue between the two theories not too 
delicate for our coarse methods of observation to decide. There was 
but one line of research along- which any experimentum crucis was to 
1)(^ met with. 

The old electro-dynamics makes electro-magnetic induction take 
place instantaneously; but according to Maxwell's doctrine it propa- 
gates itself with the velocity of light. 

The point was then to measure, or at least to make certain, a velocity 
of propagation of inductive effects. This is what the illustrious Ger- 
man iihysicist Hertz has done by the method of interferences. 

The method is well known in its application to optical i>henomena. 
Two luminous rays from one identical center interfere when they reach 
the same point after pursuing paths of different lengths. If the differ- 
ence is one, two, or any whole number of wave lengths, the two lights 
reenforce one another so that if their intensities are equal, that of their 
combination is four times as great. But if the difference is an odd 
number of half wave lengths, the two lights extinguish one another. 

Luminiferoiis waves are not peculiar in showing this phenomenon; it 
belongs to every periodic change which is propagated with definite 
velocity. Sound interferes just as light does, and so must electro- 
dynamic induction if it is strictly periodic and has a definite velocity 
of propagation. But if the proi)agation is instantaneous there can be 
no interference, since in that case there is no finite wave length. 

The phenomenon, however, qould not be observed were the wave 
length greater than the distance within which induction is sensible. 
It is therefore requisite to make the period of alternation as short as 
possible. 

ELECTRICAL EXCITERS. 

We can obtain such currents by means of an apparatus which con- 
stitutes a veritable electrical pendulum. Let two conductors be united 
by a wire. If they have not the same electric potential the electrical 
equilibrium is disturbed and tends to restore itself, just as the molar 
equilibrium is disturbed Avhen a pendulum is carried away from the 
position of repose. 

A current is set up in the wire, tending to equalize the potential, just 
as the pendulum begins to move so as to be carried back to the position 
of repose. But the pendulum does not stop when it reaches that posi- 
tion. Its inertia carries it farther. Nor, when the two electrical con- 
ductors reach the same potential, does the current in the wire cease. 
The equilibrium instantaneously existing is at. once destroyed by a 
cause analogous to inertia, namely self-induction. We know that when 
a current is interrupted it gives rise in parallel wires to an induced cur- 
rent in the same direction. The same effect is produced in the circuit 



134 LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY. 

itself, if that is not broken. In other words, a cnrrent will persist after 
the cessation of its causes, just as a moving body does not stop the 
instant it is no longer driven forward. 

When, then, the two potentials become e(j[ual, the current will go on 
and give the two conductors relative charges opposite to those they had 
at first. In this case, as in that of the pendulum, the position of equi- 
librium is i^assed, and a return motion is inevitable. Equilibrium, 
agjiin instantaneously attnined, is at once again broken for the same 
reason; and so the oscillations pursue one another unceasingly. 

Calculation shows that the period depends on the cajiacity of the con- 
ductors in such a way that it is only necessary to diminish that capacity 
sufnciently (which is easily done) to have an electric pendulum capable 
of producing an alternating current of extremely short period. 

All that was well enough known by the theoretical researches of 
Lord Kelvin and by the experimentation of Federsen on the oscillatory 
discharge of the Leyden jar. It was not that which constituted the 
originality of Hertz. 




Fk;. 1.— The liertz cxoitor. 

But it is not enough to construct a i^endulum; it is further requisite 
to set it into oscillation. For that, it is necessary to carry it off from 
equilibrium and to let it go suddenly, that is to say, to release it in a 
time short as compared to the i)eriod of its oscillation. 

For if, having pulled a pendulum to one side by a string, we were to 
let go of the string more slowly than the pendulum would have 
descended of itself, it would reach the vertical without momentum, and 
no oscillation would be set up. 

In like manner, with an electric i)endulum whose natural period is, 
say, a liundred-millionth of a second, no mechanical mode of release 
would answer the purpose at all, sudden as it might seem to us with 
our more than sluggish conceptions of promptitude. How, then, did 
Hertz solve the problem*? 

To return to our electric pendulum, a gap of a few millimeters is 
made in the wire which joins the two conductors. This gap divides our 
ai^paratus into two symmetrical parts, which are connected to the two 
poles of a Kuhmkorft" coil. The induced current begins to charge the 
two conductors, and the difference of their potential increases with 
relative slowness. 



LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY. 135 

At flrst the gap prevents a discharge from the conductors; the air in 
it phiys the role of insuhitor and maintains our penduhim in a position 
diverted from tluit of e([nilibrinm. 

But when the difference of potential becomes great enough, a si)ark 
will jump across. If the self-induction is great enough and the capacity 
and resistance small enough, there will be an oscillatory discharge 
whose period can be brought down to a hundred millionth of a second. 
The oscillatory discharge would not, it is true, last long by itself; but 
it is kept up by the Ruhmkorff' coil, whose current is itself oscillatory 
with a period of about a hundred thousandth of a second, and thus 
the pendulum gets a new imi)ulse as often as that. 

The instrument just described is called a resonance exciter. It pro- 
duces oscillations which are reversed from a hundred million to a thou- 
sand million times per second. Thanks to this extreme frequencj^, they 
can produce inductive effects at great distances. To make these effects 
sensible another electric pendulum is used, called a resonator. In this 
the coil is suppressed. It consists simply of two little metallic spheres 
very near to one another, with a long wire connecting them in a round- 
about way. 

The induction due to the exciter will set the resonator in vibration 
the more intensely the more nearly the natural periods of vibration are 
the same. At certain i)hases of the vibration the difference of poten- 
tial of the two spheres will be just great enough to cause the spai'ks to 
leap across. 

PRODUCTION OF THE INTERFERENCES. 

Thus we have an instrument which reveals the inductive waves which 
radiate from the exciter. We can study them in two ways. We may 
either expose the resonator to the direct induction of the exciter at a 
great distance, or else make this induction act at a small distance on a 
long conducting wire which the electric wave will follow and which in 
its turn will act at a small distance on the resonator. 

Whether the wave is propagated along a wire or across the air, inter- 
ferences can be iiroduced by redection. In the first case it will be 
reflected at the extremity of the wire, which it will again pass through 
in the opi^osite direction. In the second case it can be reflected on a 
metallic leaf which will act as a mirror. In either case the reflected 
ray will interfere with the direct ray, and positions will be found iu 
which the spark of the resonator will be extinguished. 

Experiments with a long wire are the easier and furnish much valu- 
able information, but they can not furnish an experimentum crucis, 
since in the old theory, as in the new, the velocity of the electric wave 
in a wire should be equal to that of light. But experiments on direct 
induction at great distances are decisive. They not only show tlmt 
the velocity of propagation of induction across air is finite, but also 
that it is equal to the velocity of the wave propagated along a wire, 
conformably to the ideas of Maxwell. 



136 LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY 



SYNTHESIS OP LIGHT. 



T shall insist less on other experiments of Hertz, more brilliant bnt 
less instructive. Concentrating with a parabolic mirror the wave of in- 
duction that emanates from the exciter, the (lerman physicist obtained 
a true pencil oj" rays of electric force, susceptible of regular reflection 
and refraction. These rays, were the ])eriod but one-milliontli of what 
it is, would not differ from raj'S of light. We know that the sun sends 
us several vai'ieties of ladiations, some luminiferons, since they act on 
tlie retina, others dark, infra-red, or ultra-violet, which reveal themselves 
in chemical andcaloritic effects. The lirst owe the qualities which ren- 
der them sensible to us to a physiological chance. For tlie physicist, 
the infra-red differs from red only as red differs from green; it simply 
has a greater wave length. Tliat of the Hertzian radiations is far greater 
still, but they are mere differences of degree, and if the ideas of Clerk 
Maxwell are true, the illustrious professor of Bonn has effected a 
genuine synthesis of light. 

CONCLUSION. 

Nevertheless, our admiration for such unhoi)ed-for successes must 
not let us forget Nvhat remains to l)e accomi)lislied. Let us endeavor to 
take exact account of tlie results definitely acijuired. 

In the first place, the velocity of direct induction through air is finite; 
for otherwise interferences could not exist. Tlius the old electrody- 
namics is condemned. But what is to be set up in its place? Is it to 
be the doctrine of Maxwell, or rather some approximation to that, for 
it w^ould be too much to sui)poso that he had ibreseeu the truth in all 
its details'? Though the iirobabilities are accumulating, no comiilete 
demonstration of that doctrine has ever attained. 

We can measure the wave length of the Hertzian oscillations. That 
length is the i)roduct of the period into the velocity of propagation. 
We should know the velocity if we knew the period; but this last is so 
minute that we can not measure it; we can only calculate it by a for- 
mula due to Lord Kelvin. That calculation leads to figures agreeable 
to the theory of Maxwell; but the last doubts will onl}' be dissipated 
when the velocity of propagation has been directly measured. (See 
Note T.) 

But this is not all. Matters are far from being as simple as this 
brief account of the matter would lead one to think. There are vari- 
ous complications. 

In the lirst place, there is around the exciter a true radiation of 
induction. The energy of the apparatus radiates abroad, and if no 
source feeds it, it quickly dissipates itself and the oscillations are rap- 
idly extinguished. Hence arises the phenomenon of multijde reso- 
nance, discovered by Messrs, Sarasin and l>e la Eive. which at lirst 
seemed irreconcilable with the theorv. 



LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY. 137 

On tlie other liaiid, we know that liglit does not exactly follow the 
laws of geonietrieal optics, and the discrepancy, due to diffraction, 
increases proportionately to the wave length. With the great waves 
of the Hertzian undulations these phenomena must assume enormous 
importance and derange everything. It is doubtless fortunate, for the 
moment at least, that our means of observation are as coarse as they 
are, for otherwise the simplicity which struck us would give place 
to a dedalian complexity in which we should lose our way. No doubt, 
a good many jyerplexing anomalies have been due to this. For the 
same reason the experimeuts to prove a refraction of the electrical 
waves can hardly be considered as demonstrative. 

It remains to speak of a difficulty still more grave, though doubtless 
not insurmountable. According to ^laxwell, the coefticient of electro- 
static induction of a transparent body ought to be equal to the square 
of its index of refraction. Now this is not so.' The few bodies which 
follow IMaxwelFs law are exceptions. The phenomena are plaiidy far 
raoie complex than was at first thought. But we have not yet been 
able to make out how matters stand, and the experiments conflict with 
one another. 

Much, then, remains to bo done. The identity of light with a vibra- 
tory motion in electricity is hencefcn-th something more than a seductive 
hy])othesis; it is a probable truth. lUit it is not yet quite proved. 

Note 1. — Since the above was written another great step has been 
taken. M. Blondlot has virtually succeeded, by ingenious experimental 
contrivances, in directly measuring the velocity of a disturbance along 
a wire. The number found differs little from the ratio of the units; 
that is, from the velocity of light, which is ;>00,000 kilometers per sec- 
ond. Since the interference experiments made at Geneva by Messrs. 
Sarasin and Be la Kive have shown, as I said above, that induction is 
proi)agated in air with the same velocity as an electric disturbance 
which follows a conducting wire, we must conclude that the velocity of 
the induction is the same as that of light, which is a contirmation of 
the ideas of Maxwell. 

M. Fizeau had formerly found for the velocity of electricity a number 
far smaller, about 180,000 kilometers. But there is no contradiction. 
The currents used by ]\I. Fizeau, though intermittent, were of small 
frequency and penetrated to the axis of the Avire, while the currents of 
M. Blondlot, oscillatory and of very short period, remained superficial 
and were confined to a layer of less than a hundredth of a millimeter 
in thickness. ( )ne may readily suppose the laws of i)ropagation are not 
t'le same in the two cases. 

Note II. — I have endeavored above to render the explanation of the 
electrostatic attractions and of the phenomena of induction comprehen- 
sible by means of a simile. Now let us see what Maxwell's idea is of 
the cause which produces the mutual attractions of currents. 

' Tliat is, it fs not so when we inalve tlie calculation with the indexes of refraction 
of tlie waves of visible lijiht. — Translator. 



138 LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY. 

Wliile the electrostatic attractions are taken to be due to a multitude 
of little springs — that is to say, to the elasticity of the ether — it is sup- 
posed to be the living- force and inertia of the same lluid which produce 
the phenomena of induction and electrodynamical effects. 

The complete calculation is far too extended for these images, and I 
shall again content myself with a simile. I shall borrow it from a well- 
known instrument — the centrifugal governor. 

The living force of this apparatus is i)roportional to the square of the 
angular velocity and to the square of the distance of the balls. 

According to the hypothesis of Maxwell, the ether is in motion in 
galvanic currents, and its living force is proportional to the stpiare of 
the intensity of the current, which thus correspond, in the parallel I 
am endeavoring to establish, to the angular velocity of rotation. 

If we consider two currents in the same direction, the living force, 
with equal intensity, will be greater the nearer the currents are to one 
another. If the currents have opi^osite directions, the living force will 
be greater the farther they are apart. 

In order to increase the anguljfr velocity of the regulator and con- 
sequently its living force, it is necessary to supply it with energy and 
consequently to overcome a resistance which we call its inertia. 

In the same way, in order to increase the intensity of a current, we 
must augment the living foice of the ether, and it will be necessary to 
sup[)ly it with energy and to overcome a resistance which is nothing 
but the inertia of the ether and which we call the induction. 

The living force will be gieater if the currents are in the same direc- 
tion and near together. The energy to be furnished the counter electro- 
motive force of induction will be greater. This is what we express when 
we say that the mutual action of two currents is to be added to their 
self induction. The contrary is the case when their directions are 
o]tposite. 

If we separate the balls of the regulator, it will be necessary, in 
order to maintain the angular velocity, to furnish energy, because with 
equal angular velocity the living force is greater the more the balls are 
separated. 

In the same way, if two currcMits have the same direction and 
brought toward one another, it will be necessary, in order to maintain 
the intensity to supply energy, because the living force will be aug- 
mented. We shall, therefore, have to overcome an electromotive force 
of induction which will tend to diminish the intensity of the currents. 
It Avould tend on the contrary to augment it, if the currents had the 
same direction and were carried apart, or if they had opposite direc- 
tions and Avere brought together. 

Finally, the centrifugal force tends to increase the distance between 
the balls which would augment the living force were the angular veloc- 
ity to be maintained. 



LIGHT AND ELECTRICITY. 139 

In like manner, wlien the currents have the same direction, they 
attract each other — that is to say, they tend to approach each other, 
which woukl increase the living- force if the intensity were maintained. 
If their directions are opposed they repel one another and tend to 
sepai\ate, which would again tend to increase the living force were the 
intensity kept constant. 

Thus, the electrostatic effects would be due to the elasticity of the 
ether and the electrodynamical phenomena to the living force. Now, 
ought this elasticity itself to be explained, as Lord Kelvin thinks, by 
rotations of small parts of the fluid? Different reasons may render 
this hypothesis attractive; but it plays no essential part in the theory 
of Maxwell, which is quite independent of it. 

In the same wpy, I have made comparisons with divers mechanisms. 
But they are only similes, and pretty rough ones. A complete mechan- 
ical explanation of electrical phenomena is not to be sought in the 
volumes of Maxwell, but only a statement of the conditions which any 
such explanation has to satisfy. Precisely what will coufer long life 
on the work of Maxwell is its being uneutangled with any special 
mechanical hypothesis. 



THE HENRY.i 



By T. (J. jMendenhall. 



Oil the 21st of August, 1893, there assembled iu Chicago an Interna- 
tional Congress of Electricians, the transactions of Avhich. while largely 
technical and scientific in their character, were in all respects impor- 
tant, and in some respects of great interest to the intelligent American 
public. 

Tlie organization of the congress and preparations for holding it in 
connection with the World's Columbian Exposition were well under way 
before the conception, or at least the publication, of the scheme for 
a series of so-called '' World's Congresses," the proceedings of which 
were brought prominently to the attention of the reading public during 
the past summer. The xVmerican Institute of Electrical Engineers was 
l)r()bably the lirst body to take action in reference to an Electrical Con- 
gress. Cordial cooperation existed between it and the Exposition 
authorities, and a large and representative advisory committee, embrac- 
ing nearly all of the leading American electricians, together with many 
of the iirst rank from foreign countries, was organized, with Dr. Elisha 
Gray, of Chicago, as chairman. 

It is not intended, in this article, to give an account of the congress 
and its doings, but to refer to its organization and personnel only so 
far as is necessary to throw liglit upon the full intent and meaning of a 
single sentence in its proceedings. 

The number of representatives of foreign governments ]>resent was 
unexpectedly large, and the delegates were of the highest character. 
To one who has some familiarity with tlie literature of electricity it will 
suftice to mention the names of Von Ilelmholtz, Mascart, Preece, Row- 
land, kSilvanus Thompson, Ferraris, Ayrton, and Hospitaller, among 
the many who took part in the deliberations of the congress. The 
honorary president was Dr. II. von Ilelmholtz, whose splendid contri- 
butions to science cover so wide a tield that he would have been easily 
tirst in congresses devoted to the consideration of several departments 
of human knowledge quite distinct and apart from that of electricity. 

In its internal constitution the congress differed in some particulars 
from all others held in Chicago, and a part of its work had more of an

142 THE HENRY. 

official iiiul iuteiiiatioiial character than that ot* any other. This was 
the consideration and official ^auction of names and values of units of 
electrical measure. 

Notwithstanding the fact that more than a hundred million dollars 
are invested in machines and instruments for the production and con- 
sumption of electricity and in their manufacture, little legislation has 
been had looking to the protection of i)roducer and consumer through 
accurate measurement, as has long been recognized to be imperatively 
necessary in other commercial transactions. It is true that the science 
of electrical measurement has been thoroughly explored; excellent 
methods and instruments have been devised and constructed, and the 
most perfect system of units of measure ever conceived has been devel- 
oped during the past quarter of a century. These units, being contin- 
ually in use anu)ng scientific men, had come to be recognized as in some 
degree authoritative among those engaged in commercial applications 
of electricity, but in general no legal values were attached to these 
units, and in reference to two or three of them scientific men were not 
yet in entire accord in their nomenclature and definition. One or two 
electrical congresses, notably that at Paris in 1881, had previously con- 
sidered these questions, and a tentative agreement upon some of the 
points at issue had been reached, but not much was accomplished that 
was satisfactory and lasting, except that an incentive was created for 
further and more accurate investigation of the values of certain jHiysical 
constants m doubt. The results of these investigations and the general 
l>rogress of the science of electricity during the past decade were such 
as to justify the bc^lief that the time had now arrived when an interna- 
tional agreement could be reached upon definitive values of the units 
desirable and necessary in electrical measurement, as well as upon the 
names they should bear. To this end it Avas desirable that the consid- 
eration of such important questions should be restricted to a smaller, 
more deliberative body than the general congress of electricians, the 
membership of which reached several hundred. It was therefore agreed 
to create what was technically known as the chamber of delegates, 
which, as its name implies, consisted of specially commissioned dele- 
gates from the several countries represented. 

In this chamber the United States, Great Britain, France, and Ger- 
many were allowed five delegates each. Some other nations were 
allowed three, others two, and some only one. 

The members bore commissions from their respective Governments, 
and twenty-six were actually in attendance, representing nine different 
nations. The four great naticuis named above had full delegations, 
some others were only partly rei)resented, and two or three nations had 
ai)pointed delegates who failed to reach Chicago in time for the meet- 
ing of the congress. The chamber met in regular session every day 
during the week of the International Congress, with Professor Eow- 
laud, of Johns Hopkins University, as its presiding officer. At the end 



V THE HENRY. 143 

it had unanimously agreed upon names and definitions for eiglit units 
of ele(;trical measure, all that are thought to be necessary or desirable 
at the present time, and no more arc likely to receive consideration for 
some years to come. The chamber passed a resolution recommending 
the otiticial and authoritative adoption of these units by the several 
nations represented in the congress. They are all primarily derived 
from the fundamental units of length, mass, and time of the metric 
system, and are thus inter-related in the simplest possible manner. 

As already stated, it is not the i)urpose of this article to discuss the 
conclusions reached by the chamber of delegates from a scientific stand- 
point, but it will be desirable to name the units selected, and explain 
in a general way their technical significance. In the order of their 
adoption by the chamber they are as follows : The ohm, the ampere, the 
volt, the coulomb, the farad, the joule, the watt, the henry. 

These names are derived from those of distinguished scientific men, 
all worthy of a place in the front rank of modern ])hysicists, and many 
of whom have made signal contributions to the advancement of the 
science of electricity and electrical measurement. 

The ohm is the unit of resistance. It has been applied by common 
consent for many years to one of the three most important characteris- 
tics of a circuit conveying a current of electricity. Its use perpetuates 
the fame of the author of a simple and beautiful law by which these 
three fundamental elements are bound together. 

G. S. Olim was born in Bavaria in 17<S1, and educated at the Univer- 
sity of Erlangen. In 181^7 he published a pami^hlet. The Galvanic 
Circuit Investigated Mathematically, containing what has since been 
universally known as ''Ohm's law," and which has had a most impor 
taut and far-reaching influence on the development of the theory and 
applications of r'lectricity. Guided by Fourier's classic investigation 
of the How of heat in conductors, Ohm, from purely theoretical consid- 
erations, arrived at the conclusion that in any circuit through which 
an electric current was made to pass the strength of the current — that 
is, the quantity of electricity passing a given section of a conductor in 
one second of time — was directly ])roportional to the elec^tro-motive 
force (often called the "electrical pressure"), and inversely proportional 
to its resistance. The imi)ortance of Ohm's investigations was not 
recognized at the time of their publication. Had the full meaning of his 
conclusions been understood by those who shortly afterwards engaged 
in the develoi^ment of the electro-magnetic telegraph, they would have 
been guided to results which were reached oidy after nuich loss of time 
and money and many vexatious and discouraging disappointments. 
In ISliS Barlow, in England, had declared the imi)ossibility of the 
telegraph, owing to the difticulty of sending electric currents through 
long wires. It was noted that the strength of the current diminished 
greatly when the length of the conductor was increased, and this was 
properly assumed to be due to the greater resistance offered to the 



144 THE HENRY. , 

passajie of the current by the increased length. Biulow suggested 
that this couhl be overcome only by enlarging the dimensions of the 
conductor, and that when a current was transmitted through any con- 
siderable distance the diameter of the wire must be enormous. For this 
reason the electro-magnetic telegraph was an impracticable scheme. 
This apparently conclusive argument undoubtedly seriously delayed 
the progress of invention along that line. 

But, curiously enough, about the time Ohm in Europe was publish- 
ing a theoretical investigation which might have furnisluHl the key to 
the solution of the problem, in Anu-rica a young man, not yet 30 years 
of age, named Joseph Henry, had begun a series of experimental 
researches at Albany, N. Y., which did make the way entirely clear a 
few years later. Henry attacked the dilticulty both as to cause and 
effect. The effect was that when the conductor through which- the 
current Avas passing was increased greatly in length, the strength of 
the current was so reduced that it was insufficient to operate the appa- 
ratus necessary for the reproduction of the signal at the receiving end. 
To nu-et this difficulty he investigated electro-magnets, and so improved 
upon the original device of Sturgeon that comparatively feeble cur- 
rents were capable of ])roducing mechanical efi^cts through long Avires. 
He also originated the ingenious device known as a "relay," by means 
of which a h)cal battery is put in operation by a main current of little 
strength, thus making local effects independent of the strength of the 
main-line currents. By his invention of the "intensity magnet" and 
use of the "intensity battery" he nuide the electro-magnetic telegraph 
possible, and in 1831 he transmitted signals through a mile of wire, 
causing a bell to ring by the action of an electro-magnet. Out of this 
has grown the astounding network of wires— overhead, underground, 
and across the seas— by which the earth is girdled and the existence 
of which has wrought more change in the treatment of social, political, 
and commercial problems than any other single fact of tlie present 
century. While many of the conclusions which Henry had experi- 
mentally reached were in harmony with and might have been deduced 
from Ohm's law, to Ohm belongs the credit of having first clearly 
pointed out the real and exact meaning of "resistance" and its relation 
to the other conditions of the circuit. The bestowal of his name upon 
the unit by wiiich it is measured is a litting recognition of the lasting 
value of his discovery. 

The ampere is the unit of current. Andre Marie Ampere, born at 
Lyons, France, in 1775, must be regarded as the creator of the science 
of electro-dynamics. In 1820 Oersted, the Dane, publislied his mag- 
niticent discovery of the effect of an electric- current upon a freely sus- 
pended magnet, thus establishing the relation between magnetism and 
electricity which many of the ablest philosophers had sought in vain 
for years. Ampere first heard of what was culled the "Copenhagen 
experiment" on September 11, 1820. On the 18th of the same month 



THE HENRY. 145 

he presented to the French Academy a paper in which he announced 
the fundamental principle of the science of electro-dynamics, together 
with a number of capital exi)erimeuts iu extension of Oersted's princi- 
ple, lu the incredibly short time of a single week he had gone all over 
Oersted's work, experimentally and theoretically; he had devised a 
new and ingenious hypothesis, for the examination of which he had 
invented novel forms of apparatus and by means of which he had 
brought the whole subject within the domain of mathematical treat- 
ment. The history of the science of electricity shows nothing more 
brilliant than the work of that inemorable week. To him who was first 
to show the action and reaction of currents upon each other, and at 
the same time furnish a rational and most useful hypothesis u})on which 
the now rapidly growiug theory of electro-magnetism might be con- 
structed, has long been freely accorded the high jnaise which is imi^lied 
in calling the unit of current measure an ampere. 

The beautifully simple law of Ohm, to which reference has already 
been made, and which is as omnipresent and omnipotent in electricity 
as is N^ewton's law of gravitation in astronomy and mechanics, is 
administered by and through a triumvirate. Two of the triad, immely, 
resistance and. current, are presented above. The third, which is 
mathematically the product of these two, is the electro-motive force 
iu the circuit, and its unit of measure is the volt. The appropriatenes-s 
of this luime will be at once recogui/.ed when the services of the dis- 
tinguished Italian philosopher, Volta, the contemporary of Galvani, 
are remembered. In his early youth Yolta was considered dull, and 
he showed little promise of future distinction. His first awakening 
to intellectual activity manifested itself in a tendency to compose 
l)oetry, but from this he turned to exi)erimental science; and when 
Galvani, in 1780, saw in the twitchings of the legs of a frog the begin- 
ning of a series of marvelous discoveries which have nuide the nine- 
teenth century greater than any that have gone before, Yolta was in 
the prime of life, thoroughly equipped by taste and experience to take 
up the subject at a point where his countryman seemed likely to leave 
it, and so enlarge and enrich it as almost to make it entirely his own. 

Differing from Galvani as to the cause of what was long called 
"galvanism,'' he originated what is known as the "contact tlieory," 
and was the first to have clear ideas of what is now termed "electro- 
motive force." His theory led him to the construction of the voltaic 
])ile or battery, which has been of incalculable value in the develop- 
ment of the science of electricity and its applications. It happens 
that the unit of measure, one volt, is very nearly the electro motive 
force of one cell of Yolta's battery, being a little less than that of an 
ordinary sulphate of copper ("bluestone") cell. 

These, the ohm, the ami)ere, and the volt, are the three fundamental 
units of electrical measurement. They are related to one another 
through Ohm's law, and, as other units are largely derived from them 
SM 91 10 



146 THE HENRY. 

it will be useful to illustrate this relatiou before proceeding further. For 
this purpose i)erhaps nothing is better than the well-known and oft- 
repeated comparison of the How of a current of electricity in a conductor 
to the flow of a stream of water through a. pipe. When water flows 
from a reservoir through a pipe the quantity which passes any point in 
the pipe in one second (current strength) depends on tlie height of the res- 
ervoir above the outlet — that is, on the ''head" or pressure under which 
it flows — and also ou the resistance which the pipe otters to its motion. 
The greater the pressure the greater the flow, and the greater the 
resistance the less the flow. The strength of the current is therefore 
directly i)roportional to the pressure, and inversely proportional to the 
resistance. If in this statement "electro-motive" force be substituted 
for "pressure," it becomes Ohm's law. When these elements are 
measured in the units given above, the electro motive force in volts, 
the resistance in ohms, and the current in amperes, the law is expressed 
very simply by saying that the "current is equal to the electro-motive 
force divided by the resistance." 

Thus, if the electro-motive force be 1 volt and the resistance of the 
circuit be 1 ohm the current will be 1 ampere. In an ordinary incan- 
descent electric lamp the electro-motive force may be about 110 volts, 
the resistance of the carbon filament when hot about 175 ohms, and the 
current must therefore be about six-tenths of an ampere. 

The unit of quantity is the coulomb. Charles Augustus Coulomb 
was a French engineer who made important contributions to science 
during the latter half of the last century. His character is well shown 
by the fact that he submitted to imprisonment rather than make a 
liivorable report upon a i>rop()sed system of canals which he examined 
as a royal commissioner and which he could not approve. His ingen- 
ious invention, the torsion balance, enabled him to measure exceedingly 
small forces with an ac(;uracy hitherto unknown in science; and by its 
use he made many brilliant researches in electricity, the first in which 
exact measurement played an important part. A coulomb is the quan- 
tity of electricity transferred by a current of 1 ampere in one second. 

The unit of capacity is the furaiJ. The name of Faraday might with 
propriety have attached to more than one unit of electrical measure. 
His remarkable career — as a newsboy, a bookbinder's ai)prentice, an 
intensely interested listener to the lectures of Sir Humphry Davy, 
Davy's helper, later his assistant, and finally his successor at the head 
of the Eoyal Institution in London — is so generally known that refer- 
ence to it is hardly necessary. In the history of electricity three 
splendid discoveries stand incomparably above all others. With the 
first the names of Galvani and Yolta are associated in the discovery 
of the new electricity and the means of generating it. In the second. 
Oersted and Ampere united in laying the foundation of the science of 
electro magnetism. The third was the discovery of "induction," in 
which Faraday and Joseph Henry made possible the marvelous develop- 
ment of the last two decades. 



THE HENRY. 147 

But every branch of the subject was euriclied by Faraday, and 
among his most brilliant investigations are those relating to the 
" capacity of condensers," and especially the influence of the dielectric. 

If an insulated, conductor is charged with electricity, the quantity 
which exists upon it will depend on the potential and the capacity of 
the conductor. It is exactly as if one spoke of the quantity of water 
in a lake or pond as depending on the depth (pressure, or ''poten- 
tial") and tlie area of the bottom (capacity). If two conductors are 
near each other, but sei)arated by a comparatively thin layer of air, 
glass, sliellac, or other dielectric, the "capacity" of the combination is 
much greater than that of either of the conductors, and it is known as 
a "condenser." The well-known Ley den jar is a common type. In 
speaking of the "potential" to which a condenser is charged, the word 
is used very much in the same sense as "electro-motive force" in what 
has gone before. Potential, therefore, may be, and constantly is, 
expressed in volts. The unit of capacity, the farad, is the capacity of 
a condenser which is charged to a potential of 1 volt by 1 coulomb of 
electricity. 

To continue the analogy already used, the unit of capacity (area of 
bottom) for vessels holding water might be defined as that which would 
require unit depth to hold unit quantity. 

The joule is the unit of work. The name of James Prescott Joule 
will forever be associated with the most splendid generalization of the 
present age, namely, the principle of the conservation of energy. 
Through his interest in electro-magnetism, and especially by his inves- 
tigation of the efficiency of electric motors, he was led to the consider- 
ation of the correlation of the various forces of nature, and associated 
with Prof. William Thomson, now Lord Kelvin, he executed a remark- 
able series of exi^eriments aftbrding cumulative proof of the indestruc- 
tibility of energy. With great appropriateness his name has been 
given to the unit of work. It is related directly and simply to the 
"erg," wiiich is the unit of work of the centimeter gram-second sys- 
tem. Ileference has already been made to the fact that when a current 
of electricity is passed through a conductor heat is generated, the 
amount depending on the resistance of the conductor and the strength 
of the current. This heat is the equivalent of the energy electrically 
expended. The joule is the energy expended in one second by a cur- 
rent of 1 ampere passing through a resistance of 1 ohm. In the com- 
mon incandescent or glow lamp the energy ex})ended as heat in the 
carbon filament is about 63 joules in every second. 

In addition to the unit of work, it is also extremely desirable to have 
a unit of rate of work, or, as it has been called by many writers, 
"activity," but whicliis more commonly expressed by the word "power." 
It is only natural that the name of one who was the first to recognize 
the necessity for a quantitative evaluation of the rate at which energy 
was absorbed, and to give numerical expression to it in the definition 



148 THE HENRY, 

of the horsepower, shoiihl be given to the new unit. The iratt is also 
simply rehited to the ceutiuieter-grani-second unit of power, and is 
defined as work done at the rate of 1 joule per second. The rate of 
expenditure of energy in the glow lamp already quoted would be 03 
watts. One horsepower is equal to about 74(5 watts. When Watt came 
to (Jlasgow he was i)revented from securing work as a mathematical- 
iustrumeut maker by the action of the trades unions of that time. For- 
tunately, the door of the great university was opened to him, and there, 
in the capacity of maker and repairer of instruments and apparatus, his 
genius received its first encouragement and development. Altliough 
by education and training rather a i)ractical than a scientific man, he 
possessed the true scientific insight to an unusual degree, and is emi- 
nently worthy of the associates among whom he is here placed. 

The foregoing somewhat lengthy and detailed account of the history 
and origin of seven of the eight units of electrical measure recently 
adopted by the international congress has been thought desirable, if 
not necessary, to a full understanding of their relation, historically and 
otherwise, to the eighth and last, the name of which is the title of this 
article. 

Most Americans are more or less familiar with the name and fame of 
Joseph Henry. To many he is known, however, only as the first Secre- 
tary of the Smithsonian Institution. Giving a broad and liberal inter- 
pretation to the somewhat vague language of the will of its fi)un(l(n', 
Henry molded the institutioii, while it was yet plastic and without 
traditions, into the form in which it has since essentially existed. He 
directed its energies into channels very different Irom those that would 
have been selected by one whose horizon was narrower than his, and, 
by steadfastly adhering to his own splendid conception of its functions 
as an instrument "for the increase and diffusion of knowledgeamong 
men," he made of it an organization which is, and nuist i)erpetually be, a 
benefit and a blessing to all mankind. Others, a smaller number, think 
of him as the youthful professor of mathematics and natural philos- 
opliy in tlie Albany Academy, where, in si)ite of the seven solid hours 
of teaching each day required of him, he found time to begin the series 
of researches in electro-magnetism winch in later years were to make 
him famous. Here, and at the College of New Jersey, at I'rinceton, to 
which he was shortly transferred, he is seen pursuing these researches 
with that clearness of* vision which characterized his work along all 
lines, and with an extraordinary fruitfulness which goes only with great 
intellectual activity accompanied by unfiiuching honesty of purpose. 
For fourteen years at Princeton, where he discharged the duties of 
professor of natural philosophy with signal success, he continued his 
original investigations, which, while touching many of the more impor- 
tant branches of i)hysical science, were in general related to his favorite 
subjects, electricity and magnetism. At the end of this period, when 
at the very highest development of his powers, he was transferred to 



THE HENRY. 149 

that larger field of activity aud usefulness wliicli was offered by the 
new institution at Washington, to enter which he knowingly, and 
against the wishes of many of his friends, ahandoned the practically 
assured prospe<;t of lasting fame as one of the three or four most dis- 
tinguished physicists of the present century. During these years the 
work was done which justifies and demands the recognition accorded 
to it in bestowing upon Henry the high honor of a place in the galaxy 
of famous physicists whose names will be perpetuated in the metro- 
logical nomenclature of all modern languages. In nnich of this work 
he was running on lines parallel to those followed by an English ])hi- 
losoi)her who is doubtless justly entitled to be considered as the first 
experimental physicist of the present age. 

Although older by several years than Henry, Faraday began his series 
of memorable investigations in electricity about the time Henry pre- 
sented his first papers on the same subject before the Albany Institute, 
a local scientific society of which he was a member. From this time 
forward they were often "treading upon each other's heels." In the 
early thirties great scientific discoveries were not announced in all parts 
of the world within twenty-four hours of their making, as is done to-day, 
thanks to tlie labor of these same two i)hilosophers who sixty years ago, 
owing to infrequent communication across the sea and scanty means of 
publication on either side, were often ignorant of an im[)ortant advance 
for some years after it had been made. Henry's innate modesty made 
him slow to recognize, at least to acknowledge, the value of what he did, 
and there is no doubt that he lost much in the way of general recogni- 
tion by his failure to bring the results of his investigations promptly 
to the attention of the scientific public. Indeed, it was sometimes the 
urgency of his friends, more jealous than himself of his scientific rei>u- 
tation, that secured the tardy publication of important papers. At that 
date, far removed both in space and time from the center of scientific 
activity, he often contended with the discouraging yet natural and 
almost necessary fact that some of his finest work had been anticipated 
by those who had the start of him in time and the advantage in facilities 
and resources. 

On August 30, 1831, Faraday made his splendid discovery of electro- 
magnetic induction. Before this time Henry had investigated the con- 
ditions necessary to the production of a strong magnetic field, and had 
constructed by far the most iiowerful magnet known u]) to that day. 
Ignorant of Faraday's work, he planned and began in August, 1831, 
a series of experiments with a still more powerful magnet, having in 
view the discovery of a method of producing electricity from magnetivsm 
which Faraday was then on the eve of making. But, as already stated, 
his duties in the academy were exacting, and, being interrupted, he 
was prevented from returning to the subject for nearly a year. In the 
meantime news of Faraday's discovery had crossed the ocean, a meager 
account of his results having reached Henr^^ sometime early in the 



150 THE HENRY. 

suininer of ^SlV2. Ho at once took up the subject, and by the aid of his 
powerful apparatus was enabled to ])roduce striking verifications and 
extensions of Faraday's conclusions. A description of tliese experi- 
ments was published in Silliman's American Journal of Science for 
July, 1832, and the article contains the first announcement of a most 
important discovery, in whicli he anticipated Faraday by several years- 
"Ik Marvel" wrote a sentence in Dream Life, wliich has been an 
inspiration to many a young man, "There is no genius in life like the 
genius of energy and industry;" and if the genius is to develop in the 
direction of experimental science he might well have added, "and the 
genius of attention to apparently unimportant, accidental phenomena." 
It was this trait that was so highly developed in his character, this 
anxi(ms solicitude that nothing, however trivial it might at the time 
seem, should escape without note, that brought to Henry the honor of 
the discovery of self-induction. 

Faraday had found that when a current of electricity through one cir- 
cuit was started, or stopped, or altered in strength, a current would be 
induced in a neighboring circuit; but the induction of apart of the cir- 
cuit upon another part, or self-induction, ha<l escaped him. Henry saw 
it in the interesting and previously unobserved fact that if the poles of 
a l)attery of no very great i)ower be connected by a long wire, and the 
circuit be suddenly broken, a spark will be produced at the point of 
interruption, while if the connecting wire be short a spark will not be 
])roduc'ed. He also noted that the eftect was increased by coiling the 
^vire into a helix, and he remarked, at the close of the article describ- 
ing these experiments, "lean account for these phenomena only by 
supposing the long wnre to become charged with electricity, which, by 
its reaction on itself, projects a spark when the connection is broken."' 
This was a capital observation; but, although published in 1832, it 
Avas apparently unknown to Faraday, who rediscovered the fact a lew 
years later and announced it as new. As a matter of fact, it appears 
that Faraday did not himself observe the fundanu^ntal phenomenon, 
but that his attention was called to it by a friend. His announcement 
was made in the Philosophical Magazine in 1834, and in a communi- 
cation to the Iloyal Society in 1835 he extended and enlarged upon the 
observation. 

In much that he had done, however, he had been anticipated by 
Henry, who, although greatly interrupted in his original investigations 
by his removal from Albany to Princeton, had himself taken up the 
phenomenon of self-induction and made an interesting research. 

As time and opportunity allowed, Henry continued his electrical inves- 
tigations during the years that followed. He was the first to obtain 
induction from induced currents, and he made a classic investigation of 

' There is good reason for believiiis tliat Heury had observed tliis pheuoiiienoii at. a 
much earlier date than that of publication, and that the observation was really 
made before the discovery of induction by Faraday. 



THE HENRY. 15 1 

mutual inductiou aud of curreuts of the secoud, third, fourth, and 
higher orders. lu addition to Ids discovery of self-induction, his 
researches on the inductive ettects of transient currents, on magnetic 
screening', and especially on the oscillations ot the electric discharge 
were on new lines and of the highest order. The investigation of the 
oscdlations of an electric discharge, one of the most important of all, 
was almost unrecognized until nearly a half century had elapsed. It 
was published in the Proceedings of the American Philosophical Soci- 
ety in 1842. In it he says: "The phenomena require us to admit the 
existence of a principal discharge in one direction, and then several 
reflex actions, backward and forward, each more feeble than the pre- 
ceding, until the equilibrium is obtained." 

Two years later ITelmholtz wrote: "We assume that the discharge is 
not a simple motion of the electricity in one direction, but a backward 
and forward motion between the coatings, in oscillation, which become 
continually smaller, until the entire vis viva is destroyed by the sum 
of the resistances;" and in 1853 Prof. W.Thompson published in the 
Philosophical Magazine a mathemati(!al investigation of Transient 
Electric Currents, developing an equation in which " the whole theory 
is packed up." 

Concerning the influence of Henry's discoveries on the marvelous 
Ijrogress of electricity during the past five or ten years, it may be well 
to rest upon the opinion of one of England's leading electricians, who, 
in the preface to a recent volume on one of the latest i)hases of electri- 
cal development, writes as follows: 

"At the head of this long line of illustrious investigators stand pre- 
eminent the names of Faraday and Henry. On the foundation stones 
of truth laid down by them all subse(|uent builders have been content 
to rest. The experimental researches of the one have been the guide 
of the experimentalist no less than the instructor of the student, since 
their orderly and detailed statements, alike of triumphant discovery 
and of suggestive failure, make them independent of any commentator. 
The scientific writings of Henry deserve hardly less careful study, for 
in them we have not only the lucid explanations of the discoverer, but 
the suggestions and ideas of a most profouiul aud inventive mind, and 
which indicate that Henry had early touched levels of discovery oidy 
just recently becoming fully worked." ' 

That one whose work is so highly esteemed should have been selected 
for honor in the international chamber of delegates is not surprising. 
It was also eminently fitting that his name should be given to the unit 
of induction. 

As already intimated, the strength of the induced current depends 
on the rapidity with which that of the inducing current is altered. 
The sudden stopj)ing of a current must be regarded as decrease at a 
very rapid rate, and the starting of a current as increase at a rapid

London, 1889. 



152 THE HENRY. 

rate. It is during- tlio most rapid changes in tlie strength of tlie iiiduc- 
iDg current that the strength of the induced current is greatest, and 
when a current is once established and flowing at a uniform rate no 
induction takes place. The unit of induction, the lioiri/, is the induc- 
tion in a circuit when the electromotive force induced is 1 volt, while 
the inducing current varies at the rate of 1 ami)ere per second. 

It was gratifying to the American delegates in the chamber at Chi. 
cagotliat the motion to adopt "henry" as the name of this unit came 
from Professor Mascart, the distinguished leader of the French delega- 
tion, for among the French, some years ago, another name, the " quad- 
rant" or " quad," had been proi)osed and since that time much used; 
that it was seconded by one of the leading delegates from England, 
Professor Ayrton, who had himself a few years ago proposed the word 
"sec-ohm" as being a proper name for the nnit of induction, a proposi- 
tion which for a time found nmch favor; and, linally, that it received 
the unanimous approval of the entire chamber, thus furnishing a testi- 
monial of the highest order of the estimation in which the work of 
Joseph Henry is held, and a recognition of his rank as a natural phi- 
losopher, which some of his own countrymen had been somewhat tardy 
to appreciate and acknowledge.

I. 

The city of Caen, whicli so cordially greets us this day, was the 
cai)itnl of Normandy, and some of the greatest events of our national 
history are recorded in its aniuils. 

Here was formed the little army tliat achieved the conquests of 
England, a glorious campaign indeed, but one from which, by a cruel 
tnrn of events, sprung a long period of struggle and misery when the 
heirs of the conquerors, merged in the great nation they had invaded, 
returned to enforce ever increasing claims upon the Kingdom of 
France. 

Few provinces have been the birthplace of so many illustrious sons — 
soldiers, sailors, politicians, magistrates, historians, orators, jurists, 
l)oets, artists, men of letters and of science. Your city has long been 
a center of learning and it still maintains its intellectual predominance 
over the neighboring departments which in former years were part of 
its territory. Your literary and scientific societies have been famous 
lor centuries. Y^ou are even now one of the principal headquarters of 
the university, and the Palace of the Faculties which you inaugurated 
a few days ago shows that your hearts are set uj)on maintaining that 
noble tradition. 

The sojourn of the French Association might afford an opportunity 
ibr paying homage to the celebrities of your place, but I am too obvi- 
ously unfit to do so. I shall confine myself to recalling; the names of 
some of the scientists of whom you may justly be proud. 

Unless we go as far back as the celebrated Graindorge family 
we mnst first mention the name of Pierre Varignon, born at Caen in 
1(354, a geometrician and mechanist, a member of the Academy of 
Sciences, whom students still hear mentioned at lectures when care is 
taken to acquaint them with the founders of science. The chemists

154 THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 

Rouelle and Vauqueliii were both born in the subnrbs of Caen of the 
most lowly families, who, by stubborn labor and struggle with the 
difticnlties of life, reached the highest station in science. Earnest- 
ness in teaching and uncommon skill in experimenting made Rouelle 
famous. It is said of him that when before an audience he was not 
quite himself until he had doffed his coat and wig, Yauqueliu had 
received but indiflerent instruction in his native village. On the advice 
of an intelligent mother he left his home at the age of 14 to make a 
living as a laboratory boy in apothecary shojis, where he stealthily 
learned the chemistry of the times. 

On being introduced to Fourcroy he had at last some leisure in which 
to perfect his knowledge, adding thereto the ancient languages; became 
the collaborator of his master; and occupied in turn the chairs of the 
ficole Polyteclinique, the l^>ole des Mines, the College de France, 
the I*]cole de Pharmacie, the Faculte de Medecine, and the Museum 
d'Histoire Naturelle. 

"After living," says Cuvier, " in circumstances closely resembling 
destitution, and being pushed by others into the possession of quite a 
considerable fortune, which increased all the more rapidly, as he never 
had any ])ersonal cravings, he always held to the habits of liis youth. 
He would return to his village every year and there meet his old 
mother without whom lie would accept no invitation, whatever might 
be the station and wealth of those who asked his company." 

Dumont-Durville, born in 1700 at Condi'sur-Noireau (Calvados), has 
carried the flag of his country over every sea on the surface of the 
globe, striking the seafaring world with amazement at the boldness of 
his uiulertakings and bringing from his travels scientitic treasures of 
every description, until the end came, after going through the most 
daring ventures in safety, by his being burned to death in a railroad 
accident. It was no vanity for him to say: "An iron will never per- 
mitted any obstacle to stand in my way. When I had once made up 
my mind to perish or succeed, I was proof against any wavering, 
against any uncertainty." 

There is at Beaumont-en- Auge a house which bears on its front an 
inscription that begins thus: 

"lu this humble dwelling Laplace was born." 

I curtail the citation so as not to lay the inspiration of this homely 
poetry open to criticism, but it is pleasant to ftnd in it the homage of 
his countrymen to one of the greatest minds of the century. In his 
oration, delivered before the Academy of Sciences, Fourier said : 

"The M'onders of heaven, the high questions of philosophy, the 
ingenious and profound combinations of mathematical analysis, all the 
laws of tlie universe, have for over sixty years occupied his mind, and 
his efforts have been crowned with immortal discoveries. - - - 

"It can not be asserted that he would have been cjualitied to create 
some entirely new science, as was done by Archimedes and Galileo; 



THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 155 

to infuse, like Descartes, Newton, and Leibnitz, original principles into 
mathematical doctrines, or, like jSTewton, to be the first in applying- to 
the sky and extending to the whole universe tlie terrestrial dynamics of 
Galileo; but Laplace was born to perfect, to search into everything, to 
remove all bounds, to solve that which may have seemed insolvable. 
He would have completed the science of the heavens if it were possible 
to complete it. - - - Science was the object of his life; science has 
made his memory imperishable." 

You also may claim as your own one of the founders of geology in 
France. Like the author of the Mecanique Celeste, filie de Beau- 
mont was a scion of a great tiimily, whose name was already prominent 
in the history of parliaments, lie had no sooner graduated from the 
I^^cole des Mines than he was, jointly with Dufreuoy, commissioned 
to make a geological map of France. After preparing for their work 
by travels abroad, especially to England, the two engineers spent many 
years in laboriously exploring every part of the country. The result 
of their gigantic work was the publication of a celebrated map which 
has served as a model, of which the geologists of to-day can only com- 
plete the details. At the same time, V'Aie de Beaumont soared to the 
loftiest conceptions in regard to the structure of the terrestrial strata, 
and recognizing no other criterion than that afforded by demonstrated 
facts, he did not hesitate to criticise the doctrines of his tutors. In 
spite of the dryness of his subjects, he knew liow to arrest attention by 
his style, from which elegance was not exclnded by accuracy, a praise 
that can seldom be made in our days. Some of his pages on the physi- 
ography of the Vosges have often been cited as bearing the marks of 
the sweetest poetry. Allow me to again borrow from it: 

"The systems of mountains are at one and the same time the most 
dehcate and the most general features of the projections on the surface 
of the globe. They are at one and the same time the quintessence of 
topography, and the most characteristic marks of the upheavals which 
the surface of the globe has exi)erienced. They are the mutnal bond 
that unites the daily operation of the elements as deternuned by the 
present relief of the earth with the events that gave this relief its shape 
in the past. When it was sought to coordinate the component parts 
of the vast cond)ination of signs with which the hand of time has 
engraved the history of the globe on its surface, it was found that the 
mountains are the capital letters of the immense manuscript, and that 
each system of mountains contains a chapter of it." 

It alfords me special pleasure to now recall the name of a modest 
savant who might, ])erhaps, experience the greatest surprise at the 
tribute which I desire to pay to his memory. Gaugain, at one time a 
student of the ficole Polytechnique, soon gave up industrial pursuits, 
in which he had met with but little success, for there was nothing he was 
less fitted for than trade, and devoted himself to scientific researches. 
There was no luxury in his laboratory; his fond daughter was his 
preparator; a bottle and a gold leaf constituted one of the most ingeni- 
ous electrometers; a few spools of sewing thread were enough to rep- 
resent electric cables. With such a crude outfit he succeeded in giving 



156 THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 

an experimeutal demonstration of the laws of the propagation of elec- 
tricity through slightly conductive bodies and to verify the correctness 
of the formulae that Ohm had merely indicated as being mathemat- 
ically analogous to Fourier's theory on the propagation of heat. With 
similar means he disclosed the relations existing between the theorems 
of static electricity and the propagation of currents. His investiga- 
tions of thermoelectric i)henomena and the properties of crystals are 
stamped with the same mark of perfection ; the methf»ds adopted by 
him still stand among the most elegant and correct. The one fault with 
his investigations was perhaps that they were too early and could not 
be well understood; they were subsequently thrown in the shade by 
more brilliant discovery, and it was only when nearing the close of his 
career that Gaugain enjoyed the well-deserved satisfaction of being 
api)reciated according to his merits. 

Augustin Fresnel was born at Brogiie. He is not therefore a citizen 
of the Department of Calvados, but he is one of yours as a Low Nor- 
man, and a memorable circumstance of his life binds him to you by 
even closer ties. At the beginning of the "Hundred days" he was 
suspended from his office of engineer for expressing too openly his 
partiality to the restoration, and came to enjoy his enforced leisure in 
the small village of Mathieu, the elder Ivouelle's home. He undertook 
at that place his labors on optics which were to make him famous. 
l>ut for that fortunate disgrace, Fresnel would, we fear, never have 
found time to give himself up to scientific investigation, by reason of 
his extremely delicate health, and to give full scope to his genius. 
From that time, and during a period of twelve years, his papers follow 
one another with prodigious fecuiulity, as though he had a presentiment 
that his days were numbered. He shattered forever the hypothesis of 
emission by showing that all the phenomena of interference and diffrac- 
tion are the necessary consequence of the doctrine of undulations; and 
he followed up the expansion of that theory in all its details by setting 
down tiie rules of reilection, refraction, double refraction, etc. 

Whenever he found that mathematical analysis or the accepted 
notions on the mechanical structure of the mediums did notattbrd him 
adequate resources, he boldly skii)ped the arduous passages over which 
he had no time to tarry and guessiBd the rest. After eighty years his 
work remains intact, confirmed more and more by subsequent investiga- 
tions. His i)apers still constitute the most fruitful reading for physi- 
cists. They afford a better comprehension of his mind, and offer a vast 
number of disseminated prolific notions which had at first escaped 
notice, and which others after him tiiought they had discovered. New- 
ton alone, according to an English savant, is greater than he. 

A bust of Fresnel stands on his grave at the Pere-Lachaise ceme- 
tery. Some years ago the Societe de Physique set about to search 
for any memento of this national celebrity. An abandoned grave, hid- 
den from view by wild vegetation, was discovered with great difficulty. 



THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 157 

No near or distant relative authorized to maiutaiu its sanctity was in 
existence. Being unable to do more for the i)resent, the society had 
the unpretending" monument repaired and keeps it reverently adorned 
with tlowers, Lavoisier has been waiting a century for the memorial 
he is entitled to, but the oversight will soon be repaired. At a time 
like this when the taleut of our artists is a suflicient justiti(;ation for 
the number of statues, Fresnel should wait no longer. 

You also hold title to another celebrity in astronomy and celestial 
mechanics, Leverrier born at St. Malo de la Cande (Manche), in the 
heart of Normandy, and whom it was the pride of the College of Caen 
to number a.mong its stiulents. Leverrier is chiefly known for his 
discovery of Neptune. The learned astronomer, while yet almost a 
beginner, succeeded by a formidable amount of clever and sedulous 
calculations in determining its existence and its position in the heavens. 
Tlie planet Uranus appears every day in the telescope which is set for 
it at the meridian, now ahead, and then aback of tlie anticipated time, 
but never by more than a second. These slight differences were, how- 
ever, the starting point for which the disturbing celestial body was 
looked for and found on the very day when the announcement Avas made 
within a degree of the position given by the reckonings. The expanse 
open to observations, within which the planets gravitate around the 
sun, has been doubled by the discovery of Neptune. Although the gen- 
eral public is less familiar with the works of Leverrier on the stability 
of the solar system and on the theory of the several planets, these are, 
nevertheless, imperishable monuments. 

In a different field Leverrier proved to be a veritable originator. 
The hurricane which fell upon the allied fleets in the Black Sea in 1854: 
and caused the loss of the French ship Henri ZFis still remembered. 
Gales had been signaled at the same time over the whole* of Europe 
with differences of from one to two days. Leverrier instituted an 
inquiry among the observatories of the several countries. It was found, 
upon a retrospective examination of the perturbation, that it had pro- 
gressed from the west to the east, and that through telegraphic warn- 
ing our fleets and armies might have been saved from the disaster. 
Grasping at once the imi)ort of an international service of weather 
forecast, he applied his whole diligence to the purpose. As early as 
1857 the observatory at Paris was in daily receipt of telegrams from 
all parts of Europe and inaugurated the service of notices which has 
since been imitated the world over: "To signal a hurricane," thought 
he, ''as soon as it may make its appearance in any part of Europe, to 
follow it in its advance by means of the telegraph and to give previous 
notice to such coasts as it may visit, such is the ultimate end of the 
organization we are aiming at." 

Moreover he was looking upon that science from a higher standpoint. 
The laws of the atmospheric movements can not be known unless all 
the phenomena produced are examined upon a large area, if not over 



158 THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY, 

the wLole surface of tlie eartli. "Better," said he, "ascertain focts iu 
all ])arts at one time during the year tlian to keep up for a whole cen- 
tury a few scattered observations." Besides, these movements undergo 
changes in each region according to local conditions, so that the gen- 
eral manifestations of the climate, the course of rainfall and of tem- 
perature recjuire a system of interde[)endeut observations. Leverrier 
leaves nothing undone. He bespeaks the cooperation of foreign observ- 
atories for the forecast service, that of seafaring men for the meteoro- 
logical observations on the ocean, that of all willing contributors for a 
knowledge of all the i)articulars of climate in France. We have inher- 
ited the responsible duty of continuing this part of his work, and have 
hardly anything better to do than to follow up his X)rogramme. Would 
that we could fultill it. 

In one respect Leverrier is specially entitled to our gratitude. He 
f<»unde<l, in 18(!4, the Association Scientifi(|ue, an efflcient organiza- 
tion which, after long prosperity, finally consolidated with ours, a new- 
comer, so as to constitute a compact union of scientists and of friends 
of science from all parts. 

I again tind here occasion to speak of one of your fellow-townsmen. 
In ISoU an association of men, moved by the spirit of j^rogress, and of 
which de Caumont was the most active member, wished to place on the 
footing of i)ermanent organization certain scientific congresses that 
had already met regularly for a number of years, and drafted the con- 
stitution of an institute of the provinces whose object was to include 
all men of letters and of science whose long labors had won for them 
a well-deserved renown. In the minds of its founders, that society 
Avas to be the soul of the acadennc movement in France and the depart- 
ments. They expected to fulfill tliat part by multiplying calls for con- 
gresses, by establishing closer relations between local societies and 
academies, thus leading them to greater uniformity in their work and 
publications so as to unite for the same ends the large amount of power 
scattered all over the soil of France. 

De (laumont was indefatigable. He recklessly spent his time and 
his own fortune. The very plan of the undertaking did perhaps con- 
tain germs of weakness for the future, but the scheme Mas a generous 
one, and although they never met with any of the encouragement they 
might have anticipated, the founders were largely instrumental in 
arousing scientific activity in the tlepartments. Their efforts have 
been successful, for it cannot be denied that the committee of scientific 
societies, now a dependency of the ministry of public instruction, the 
annual meetings of the Sorbonne, the congresses of the late scientific 
association and the sittings of the French Association are carrying 
out under various forms the several parts of the vast programme that 
the Institute of the Provinces had set up for itself. After holding its 
own for thirty-four years, the Institute of the Provinces made way for 
the I'rench Association, which aimed at the same ends with better 
means of action and better security for the future. 



THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 159 

De Caunioiit was above- all an arcluvolugist, and lie has liis place 
inaiked among the leading fouudeis of the science, but the part he 
took in developing scientific activity in the provinces is liable to sooner 
pass from memory. Tbis is a tit occasion on which to pay tribute to 
his achievements in intellectual propagation. 

It is not only in the scieutitic domain that you have an abundance of 
local celebrities. You have already done justice to the most famous, 
but there is still ample material from which to designate your streets and 
public squares with names that redound to the glory of your country. 

II. 

You will not be surprised if a president who has crossed the Atlantic 
and thereby been kept from discharging the duties that fell to him last 
year at the Besan^'on congress, now feels desirous of explaining his 
absence and of laying before you some reiuiniscences of the American 
continent. The United States have come to be a fashionable topic. 
They have been much talked of in newspapers and publications of all 
kinds, in a rather unkind vein at first, we must confess, but public 
opinion has since undergone a perceptible change. 

The visitors brought to that country by the Chicago Exposition 
are unanimous in confessing their opinion that while the manners 
there widely differ from ours, the Americans in the- North constitute a 
great nation, whose influence will be more and more felt on the ancient 
continent. 

Upon first landing in the United States one is not very favorably 
impressed, possibly from the effects of prejudice. One sees tiiere rest- 
less people who rush through the streets as through the halls of a bank, 
with no other care than business; who do away with idle talk and 
forms of politeness to save time, and whose only concern seems to be 
about the number of dollars that the day will bring m. In that land 
of freedom a high price appears to be set on everything, public office, 
access to the bench, and the stewardship of city funds. The young go 
into early training at snuill trades which enable them to '' make money" 
whatever may be the circumstances of their fathers, and launch into 
greater undertakings before their minds have gone through sufficient 
intellectual preparation. The girls, who generally have better instruc- 
tion, direct their own course iu the world, receive friends of either 
sex, and being without the attraction of a dowry, depend upon their 
personal gifts and charms to find husbands who have already been suc- 
cessful in business, and whom they are to win for themselves. Outside 
of cities, and not remote from the Eastern coast, where civilization has 
longer existed, forests have been burned, either for the purpose of 
leaching the ashes or simply for making a clearing at small expense, 
thus absolutely spurning the wealth wasted in that manner. In 
meadows or cultivated fields charred trunks or huge stumps stand here 
and there as witnesses of wanton destruction, and have beeu left on 



160 THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 

the spot because tbey would not yield enough to pay for more com- 
lilete removal. In the far West settlers are seldom seen witlunit their 
revolvers, with which they are armed not only for defense against and, 
if need be, the merciless extermination of the aborigines, but also to 
light against newcomers, and thus maintain ^lossession of their fields 
or mines. 

The multitude of emigrants, who are .prone to blend their various 
origins and to constitute a peculiar race, comes in like an armj^ of 
invaders gifted with unwonted pluck, and bent on making the most of 
the country without many scruples or nmch regard for the future. 

I need not say that such a picture, in spite of its foundation of 
truth, is no more accurate than a cartoon is like a, i>ortrait, but "Paris 
en Amerique" is also a legend that jiuist be taken with consi<lerable 
allowance. 

And yet a longer intercourse with the Americans, a more thorough 
insight into their private lives and i)ublic institutions, a ]>artial dei)ar- 
ture from the European standpoint and our historical traditiims, will 
very soon create in us a genuine sense of admiration for the pro- 
digious results they have achieved in a few centuries. The country 
has received its true characteristics from its people of Anglo-iSaxon 
descent; they have imbued it with a spirit of adventure, of profitable 
enterprise, of independence and liberty. Those who go there with any 
ambition for success must i)erforce conform by degrees to the same 
ideas. In most cases the process of assimilation is evidenced by their 
rapidly forgetting their mother tongue. Free will is impeded by no 
trammels; everyone works for himself and his own, and makes as few 
calls as possible on the lesources of the community. 

Without saying anything of the general departments of the Union 
and of the several States which might profitably be considered, I only 
wish to call your aftention for an instant to the part taken by private 
initiative in scientific matters. We all have within us, at different 
degrees of development, the notion of a State — Providence — but the 
State is not ecjual to this universal function, and the support that is 
too often demanded as of right from it is detrimental to the share that 
each individual might take in matters of public interest. 

To be sure there are benefactors left in our country. Several names 
are upon your li})s, and they would be the first to admit that examples 
from the ISTew World are likely to enhance their merits in your opinion. 

The foundations of scientific institutions or establishments in the 
United States are of two kinds. Some are progress! v^e; others are, so 
to speak, extemporaneous. 

In the year KJUO a colony of Puritans, persecuted in England on 
account of their religious tenets, came to America and founded the 
town of Plymouth, on the coast of Massachusetts. In WoO others of 
their faith from Boston and other parts of J^higland settled Boston, 
Massachusetts, near Plymouth; their new city has eclipsed the mother 



THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 161 

town in a sing-ular manner. In 1636 the general court appropriated a 
sum of 12,000 for the foundation of a college, especially denominational 
in its character, in a neighboring- place, which soon assumed the name 
of Cambridge in remembrance of the celebrated university at which 
most of the colonists had received their education. Two years there- 
after Eev. John Harvard bequeathed one-half of his property and the 
whole of his library to the new college. Such was the origin of Har- 
vard College, which later became the Harvard University. 

That example of private donations has been uninterruptedly followed 
ever since. The institution, which had very hard beginnings, refused 
no offerings, however modest. The list includes a lot of sheep, 9 shil- 
lings' worth of cotton, a pewter i)ot, a fruit dish, a sugar spoon, a pitcher 
inlaid with silver, etc. The college subsequently received the income 
of the ferry which crossed the river. 

During many years the history of the college is but a narrative of a 
succession of financial difficulties; of strife with the city council, that 
sought to maintain its control over the institution; with the govern- 
ment of the metropolis, with which the sentiments of the founders 
found little favor; and, lastly, with the clergy, to the end that teachers 
and students might preserve their religious independence and that the 
scope of teaching- be enlarged. Some of the buildings were destroyed 
by several fires, but in these instances, barring- the regret felt for the 
loss of the articles destroyed — as, for instance, the library of Harvard, 
the founder, wliich had theretofore been preserved as a relic — the evil 
proved a blessing- in the end, for private contribution, under the emo- 
tion caused by the calamity, supj)Iied means far in excess of the losses 
sustained by the disaster. 

Even in the midst of the ordeals caused by the Eevolutionary and 
civil wars, the institution constantly added to its wealth and continued 
its onward march. It shakes off at last every outside influence and 
acquires absolute autonomy. Harvard University at the present day 
constitutes a powerful corporation, which includes faculties of arts, 
sciences, theology, law, medicine, dental and veterinary surgery, and 
agriculture. In 1891-92 there were 253 teachers of various grades and 
2,700 students, who were the recipients of subsidies in various shapes, 
prizes, or cost of tuition amounting to $85,000. 

In 1891 the aggregate of ordinary receipts, income from various 
sources, and money paid for instruction, was $966,000. Over and 
above these sums, there was received during the year $100,000 to add 
to the capital and $65,000 for immediate use, without taking into ac- 
count the donations in kind such as scientific collections or implements. 
The greater portion of the capital comes from gifts without any special 
application and remains at the disposal of the directors; about one- 
fifth consists of special funds destined for the erection of buildings, the 
maintenance of certain chairs, laboratories, gymnasiums, lecture halls, 
or for special investigations. It is proper to mention at this i^lace the 
SM 94 11 



162 THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 

admirable Museum of Comparative Zoology founded by Louis Agassiz, 
as well as the observatory established by Bond iu 1840, which com- 
mands a revenue of its own such as to enable it to maintain, besides 
the mother institution and transient missions, three meteorolgical sta- 
tions in the United States, a permanent astronomical observatory at 
Arequipa, Peru, 2,600 meters above the level of the sea, and a meteo- 
rological station on Mount Chachani, Peru, at an altitude of 5,460 
meters. 

The university spends its income, but when confronted by some new 
reauirement it need not be embarrassed. Such is the popularity it 
enjoys that all it needs to do is to publish a notice in the daily press 
that a sum of $50,000 is deemed necessary for the establishment of a 
chair of histology or of the Peruvian language, and in a fortnight the 
sum will be subscribed. 

It happens that some of the donations cause the directors considera- 
ble embarrassment; such, for instance, as the pension applicable to the 
maintenance of a pastor of Indian extraction. Xot only are the origi- 
nal races indifferently adapted to the duties of a Christian pastor, but 
the incumbents themselves will fail on the day, that may be near at 
hand, when they shall have disappeared before the advance of a civili- 
zation they can not withstand. 

A number of institutions of learning, charity, or public utility have 
had a similar origin in the several States, and have in time grown 
always in proportion to the good they have done. But the pace must 
be quicker in these days of ours. Cities thrive at a more rapid rate, 
and each State strives to do as well as the neighboring States or better. 

Chicago was last year the focus of public attention, and our country- 
men have had some share in founding that great city. For these two 
reasons we shall refer to it for some examples. The Institute of Fine 
Arts of Chicago, incorporated under legal authority in 1879, erected in 
1892, after occupying several temporary homes, a palace that cost 
$600,000. I give the figures, because everything is measured by them 
in America. This institute is nothing more than an association organ- 
ized for the public good, and all its revenues are applied to the advance- 
ment of art. It receives no subsidy from the State or the city; it has 
no other source of income than the tuition fees and private contri- 
butions. It has barely made a start and it already owns valuable col- 
lections, donated by private citizens, some of which are entitled to the 
much coveted name of being the greatest in the United States, pending 
the time when they will be the greatest iu the world. 

The first university of Chicago, begun in 1858, was not a success. 
It closed its doors iu 1886. In 1889, Mr. John D. Eockefeller, after 
taking reliable advice, undertook to resurrect it and began ^ith a dona- 
tion of $600,000, subject to that noteworthy condition that $400,000 
more be collected by subscription before a certain date, for he wanted 
to make sure that the public would approve his undertaking. Encour- 



THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 163 

aged by the success then achieved, he added, in 1S90, $1,000,000 to his 
original contribution; then, in 1802, one thousand 5 per cent bonds, 
representing another million. In the same year Mr. Marshall Field 
donated $100,000 for a special purpose, on condition that a million 
dollars be secured by subscriptions within ninety days, and all was 
subscribed before the appointed day. In the month of December Mr. 
Kockefeller again contributed bonds for $1,000,000. The same influx 
of liberality occurred in 1893, when again donations are made condition- 
ally, and the required complement never fails to realize at a stated 
time. 

This infant university, which has kept the name of its founder, Mr. 
Eockefeller, is almost as wealthy already as its elder, Harvard. It has 
teachers in every branch of learning, and its material equipment is 
such as to excite much envy. It is not my object to go into an exami- 
nation of the courses, but one may rest assured that, with the command 
of such resources, a supply which is never exhausted, and the facility 
thus afforded of calling men of the highest merit to its chairs, the 
University of Chicago has a great future in store, and it will make its 
mark in scientific advancement. 

1 have no desire to continue dazzling you with figures; all I should 
have to do woukl be to quote freely from the documents distributed with 
readiness by the Americans. 

The Armour Institute bears a name which the trade in food products 
has made known over the whole world. This tells for itself where the 
dollars come from. This institution now comprises nine dei)artmeuts 
for the simultaneous teaching of letters, fine arts, sciences and their 
applications, household arts, education, and commerce. "The Armour 
Institute," says the programme, ''aims to help those who are willing to 
hell) themselves and to educate the head, hand, and heart" — the three 
"hs", as they stylo it over there. 

The same methods obtain in all the States, whether young or old. It 
would require a volume to convey an idea of the liberality with which 
the citizens act toward the institutions of learning, whatever be their 
degree. 

Astronomy enjoys especial favor. Observatories with greater or less 
endowments are erected in all parts; but, save that at Washington, 
which is Federal property, nearly all the others are private foundations 
with resources which to us are not usual. The largest telescope yet 
known, built for the Chicago Observatory, was at the Exposition. 

The founder of the Pulkowa Observatory expressed the desire that 
it might possess a telescope as powerful as any that was to be found 
in the world; the Americans are bent on having the largest. It is the 
ancient fable: Bacchus created a wonderful fox that could not be out- 
run; Yulcan, on the other hand, gave to a dog of his own making the 
faculty of overtaking any animal that it might chase. "Then it came 
to pass that both beasts met." In the present case all the appear- 
ances are in favor of the Yankee god coming out best. 



164 THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 

And yet America occupies eA^eu now a place of honor in astronomical 
discoveries, and her share grows greater every day. Besides, every 
science is rapidly progressing there, and her scientists of the first rank 
are multiplying. There will soon be nothing except history for which 
the United States can envy the nations of the old continents. 

You will no doubt hold that it is a grand sight to behold a people 
against whom the charge of avarice and of immoderate lust of gain is 
readily brought, show themselves so universally considerate of the 
public weal and achieve such results either through the continuous 
action of the citizens or through princely foundations, whether it be a 
question of charitable institutions, model hospitals, fine arts, juimary 
or trade schools, institutions for the training of engineers or machinists, 
or of institutions of learning for the intellectual elevation of the mind, 
and all without any design for commercial gain. Men of pluck and 
daring make fortunes in a short time. They are not to the same extent 
as we are intent on letting their heirs i)rofit by the whole of their 
wealth. In the same manner as titles of nobility are sought after else- 
where, they have at heart to perpetuate their names by enduring deeds 
that will do good to the community or honor to the country. 

Are our efforts in that direction to be comj)ared with those, even 
though we may take into consideration all the liberal gifts it would be 
unfair to ignore? Do not those w^ho are among the foremost favorites 
of fortune, either by grace of their ancestors or through personal indus- 
try, experience greater difficulty, as I look upon it from some distance, 
in putting their wealth to good use than they ever had in coming by it? 

I am well aware of the fact that the greater number of institutions 
in our country are under State control and that no one thinks much of 
giving to the State, because such donations are merged in the ocean 
of appropriations. The French Association is free from such objec- 
tions. It is a private institution, founded by men of honest purpose 
whose object was the advancement of science for the good name of the 
country. It promotes that purpose by calling these meetings, so fraught 
with good results, that bring us together at various parts of our terri- 
tory. It strives to assist single-handed investigators and applies the 
best part of its resourses to such assistance. It lacks none of the requi- 
sites that should receive the attention of donors and it deserves to 
attract it. We already find great encouragement in our circumstances. 
The total receipts from donations, bequests, and founders' shares exceed 
1,000,000 francs at the present time. It is propei' to separate therefrom 
the legacies of Messrs. Brunet, Legroux, Fontarive, and Girard (this 
latter being set apart for the section of anthropology), which aggregate 
over 400,000 francs. 

If I may be allowed to throw out a hint for those who may be 
encouraged by these examples, I would suggest that the nature of the 
investigations they intend to further be not defined with too narrow 
preciseness. We need not fear that we might be required to maintain

an Indiau pastor, but science is making unceasing strides forward; 
questions present themselves under altered forms, new ones come up, 
and others again unexpectedly command more interest than could have 
been anticipated. The board of directors of the association is com- 
posed of recognized savants who will manage such funds as may be 
intrusted to their care to the best advantage of science and country. 

III. 

Tradition requires that the president of your academy should im. 
part to you his comments on the advance made in such branch of the 
sciences as may have received his greatest attention. My duties might 
perhaps lead me to speak of the weather. It is a toj^ic that is always 
in order. But electricity has reached so prominent a i^lace in industrial 
and social matters that you will readily pardon me for endeavoring to 
retrace some of the features of its history. 

The science of electricity dates from at least as remote a period as 
classic antiquity, but it did not really come into favor until the course 
of the eighteenth century. Experiments then began to multiply, in 
some confusion at first, for most of the important facts were made 
known at the same time. Order was gradually established. The con- 
ductibility of various mediums, the two kinds of electricity, and con- 
densation, were discovered in turn. The transmission of signals to long 
distances was even conceived, while De Eomas and Franklin ascertained 
the identity of lightning and electrical sparks. There seemed to be 
nothing left undone after Coulomb had demonstrated that the reciprocal 
action of electrified bodies and magnets was the same as that of uni- 
versal gravitation. The mathematical methods, as i^eTfected by the 
astronomers, were applied to the new science, and the phenomena, or at 
least most of them, were to be deduced by mere calculation. 

To be sure Volta made thereupon an unexpected discovery, the voltaic 
pile, at the effects of which his contemporaries marveled ; but there will 
always be shortsighted minds entertaining the notion that human 
progress is drawing near the bounds of its course. 

In a History of Galvanism, published in 1805 and not extensively 
read in our days (who among us can cherish the hope of being read a 
century hence?), the author returns a very fit answer to the objection 
of those who believe that history should not be published until it is 
absolutely complete; but he i)roceeds thus: 

"Moreover, if fresh material compels us to publish a third part, as 
it will consist of new matter distinct from that of the first two, it will 
answer as a sequel to those two, and will perhaps make up the conclu- 
sion of the History of Galvanism, which may be nearer its end than is 
generally believed." 

It was an unfortunate prediction, for he was forthwith compelled to 
add a third and even a fourth part; he would have many more addi- 
tions to make. The First Consul had better judgment. Four years 



166 THE AGE OP ELECTRICITY. 

before, on the IGtli Brumaire of the year 10, after atteiidiug the sitting 
of tlie institute at wliicli Volta's jiaper on the pile was read, he was 
struck with the idea that it woukl be a credit to France to open a con- 
test to which all the scientists from all countries should be invited, and 
to award an extraordinary prize " to the most valuable writing on this 
branch of physics which seemed to open the way for great discoveries." 

Progress in science is made by starts, when a felicitous experiment 
or a stroke of genius brings a change in its confines. It took over 
twenty years after Volta to find whether any perceptible phenomenon 
takes place in the copper conductor which connects the two poles in 
the pile. The discovery of Oersted and the immortal investigations of 
Ampere established a relation between electricity and magnetism ; iron 
was magnetized by means of currents and electrical telegraphy was the 
result. 

But what a number of questions then confronted our minds. As long 
as the i)henomena remained independent of one another, they could be 
explained by special theories applying to each one of them. It was the 
day of fluids. After the caloric fluid, it cost no greater ettort to imagine 
the two electric fluids and the two magnetic fluids, to say nothing of 
the neutral fluids required to connect them, and the ether with which 
the universe was filled to serve as a medium of transmission of light. 
No true philosophy can be based on such a multiplicity of independent 
entities, for phenomena are not confined in distinct provinces with their 
immediate causes. Ampere had already pointed out that it would 
undoubtedly be necessary to turn to the intervention of the fluid that 
pervades all si)ace in order to explain the forces that operate between 
conductors carrying electric currents. 

The agent itself remains a mystery, a title that electricity enjoys by 
privilege, as it were. Yet we must admit without looking back to the 
origin of all things, that science is everywhere face to face with myste- 
ries — universal gravitation, heat, constitution of bodies, light, electric- 
ity, magmetism, life, — 

While habit impels us to accept such of these as come under the 
more direct observation of our senses, they remain none the less inex- 
plicable, and we must confine ourselves to a study of experimental laws, 
more or less connected by other laws of a more general character, with- 
out any possibility of penetrating the intimate structure of the universe. 
One of the great minds of our age, in whose presence wonder was 
expressed at the inexplicability of certain phenomena, remarked with 
profound neaning: "Tell me what electricity is and I will tell you all 
the rest." 

After Oersted and Ampere, a great step remained to be made. 
"When it is seen," said Fresnel in 1820, "that an electric current 
running through a metallic helix wound around a steel cylinder mag- 
netizes the latter, it seems natural to try whether a magnetized bar 
is not capable of producing a voltaic current in the surrounding 



THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 167 

helix; not that this be at first sight a natural consequence of the facts 
- - - yet I thought it would not be an idle experiment to attempt." 
The result was disappointing, and Fresnel concludes that curious 
paper with the following words: 

"I must add, in behalf of M. Ampere, that the slight movements 
that he had noticed in a magnetic needle when he brought near to it a 
circuit of brass wire, a part of which was spirally wound, around a 
magnet, were not repeated in a constant manner, and besides that 
tbey were so slight that he would not have made that experiment 
public had he not felt certain from the success of my own experiment, 
of which he entertained no doubt, that these slight motions were also 
caused by an electric current produced by the magnet acting upon tbe 
helix wound around it.'' 

We may rely on the notorious awkwardness of Ampere for an assur- 
ance that his helix was not attached to the magnet, that it was thrown 
out of shape while a portion of the wire was brought near the needle, 
and that he had actually discovered the induction currents; it wall 
sufiice to repeat his exj)eriment without any modification. 

Shortly thereafter Daniel Colladon, in whom the last figure of an 
illustrious generation has just disappeared, also investigated, by a 
more delicate process, whether a very powerful magnet will produce 
an electric current in a helix by being brought near it. The helix was 
connected with a galvanometer and the latter was kept in a separate 
room so as to preclude any direct action of the magnet. After making 
all preparations for the exj)eriment and j)utting the magnet in posi- 
tion, Colladon would go and inspect his galvanometer. He probably 
did so without great haste, for the index was motionless and at the 
same point where it stood before. 

"I had not suspected," said he, "that induction could only be 
instantaneous. If I had had an assistant he would have seen for me 
the displacement of the magnetic needle occurring at the instant when 
I brought the magnet near the helix." 

It has sometimes been said that the induction currents are the sen- 
tries charged with the protection of the principle of the conservation 
of energy. Nothing is produced without an expense of labor, and the 
failure of the preceding experiments was due to a singular oversight 
of that i)rinciple. 

The discovery by Arago of the effect of copper plates in abating the 
oscillations of magnetic bars, and of the attraction of these bars by 
conductive mediums in motion was giving there and then the clew 
to inductive currents and the energy necessary for their maintenance. 
Again they were at hand when Ampere and Colladon went over the 
same experiments by substituting helices conducting a current for the 
bars, and when Fresnel, in an experiment that remained unpublished 
for a long while, demonstrated that by increasing the weight of the 
magnetic bar with a copper bar, the oscillations were modified with 
greater rapidity than the increased mass of the whole would lead to 
suppose. 



168 THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 

Finally, 1 have it as a tradition that once Pouillet, showing in a 
lecture the properties of an unusually powerful electro-magnet, was so 
rash as to break Avith both his hands the exciting current so as to 
show that the magnetic force had instantly, almost wholly, disappeared. 
He received a shock which came near striking him down. We now 
know that the extra-current of rupture had run through his body. 

The experiments made before the days of Faraday show how obscure 
is the path that leads to the unknown and how hard it is to put to a 
practical use the precepts of philosophers, although their principle may 
be excellent. The induction currents hud been sought after without 
being found; they were found without being seen. The best minds had 
a preconceived notion of them which no doubt would have soon taken 
the shape of demonstrated facts, but so many failures only enhance the 
feme of the true originator of modern electricity. We can thus realize 
how bitter were the feelings of Ampere, who had had this signal dis- 
covery within his grasp; and after all he left in the history of sciences 
a good enough record to preclude envy of his successors. 

As to Faraday, he lived in a world of notions that were peculiarly his 
own. He had but little regard for old paths and followed the lead of 
his genius. He was a skillful expei'imenter and knew how to interpret 
phenomena in accordance with what seemed to him to most closely 
conform to nature, heedless of accepted theories and current ideas. To 
indiscreet questions on the subject of his present experiments he would 
answer with the most sincere modesty: "Do not ask me; I am seeking 
for absurdities." 

It has subsequently been found that the induction currents are a 
necessary consequence of the general laws and that they might have 
been foreseen; foresight is easy as an afterthought. 

It would be superfluous to dwell on the universal applicability of the 
inductive currents. They are found in telegraphs, in our house bells, 
in that recent wonder the telephone; they are the key to the present 
condition of industrial electricity; they are displayed in the indirect 
effects of lightning, in those produced ujion telegraphic circuits by 
the variations of terrestrial magnetism, in the grand apparitions of the 
polar auroras; they even seem to respond on our globe to the physical 
disturbances which incessantly affect the solar mass, and thus enable 
us to perceive through the vacuum of space, if not the celestial har- 
mony, at least the echo of the terrific commotions of which the center of 
our planetary system is the seat. 

At the same time Faraday resumed the study of electrical influence, 
a question that was thought to have been solved long ago, and pre- 
sented a new interpretation. The conception of the force lines, which 
was the fruit of that study, has made it possible to i)ut into physical 
shape, so to speak, the most abstract results of analysis. Faraday 
gave prominence to this fruitful conception by a succession of skillfully 
conducted experiments and intuitive deductions. It could properly be 



THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 169 

said of him that, without figuring out any computation and without 
writing down an equation, he had proved himself a great geometrician. 

Faraday's mind carried him further. He imagined that the very 
notion of action from a distance could not stand, and that in every 
instance the intervening medium plays the leading part. To electrify 
a body, to produce a magnet, is but to modify the conditions of the 
medium by which they are surrounded, and the forces that may be 
brought out in the field of action are but a manifestation of the elastic 
properties of the intervening medium. 

The condition of the fluid theory, then, appears considerably dam- 
aged; it was even worse when Faraday discovered after numerous 
attempts — the secret of which he kept— that a ray of light is altered 
in passing through a magnetic field produced by magnets or currents; 
so that there is a connection among them all — electricity, magnetism, 
light, and consequently heat. We have no longer before us isolated per- 
sonages acting independently of one another, but the several actors in 
the great drama of nature which each one renders under a particular 
form; whose passions come in conflict and undergo transformations as 
the plot i^rogresses; the spectator, human intellect, at first listened to 
the several i>arts in turn ; he is aware to-day of a commou action and 
of a general bond which will probably remain the great mystery. 

Universal gravitation itself, which was held to be the type of action 
from a distance, must be subject to the common rule and find its true 
exi)lanation in the structure of the medium which fills the celestial 
space. 

One of our best-beloved masters, before whom the examjile of the sun, 
which attracts the earth, was given as an objection to these ideas, said : 
" Have you seen his hands ? If the sun attracts the earth, he must have 
hands and a string." 

The adoption of a system of interdependent measures for electric and 
magnetic phenomena which worked invaluable good in industrial appli- 
cations had previously been the starting point of immense progress 
in the province of pure science. It has been ascertained that if the 
same (quantity of electricity is measured by Coulomb's law on recipro- 
cal actions or by the magnetic properties of currents the ratio of the 
two values is a physical velocity, and it was found by experiment 
to be virtually at the same rate as the velocity of the propagation of 
light. Such a coincidence could not be the effect of mere accident; it 
bespoke a close connection between electricity and light. 

Clerk Maxwell, who had made a profound study of Faraday's works 
on the action of the mediums, thought that they were the actual seat 
of electrical phenomena. In a learned mathematical analysis he proved 
that luminous undulations maybe explained by means of currents whose 
frequent alternations excite other currents in the adjacent parts and 
propagate from place to i^lace, in which case the velocity of propaga- 
tion would be nothing else than the celebrated ratio of units of measure- 



170 THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 

inent. Light, then, would be a combination of electric currents, char- 
acterized by the prodigious frequency of alternations, a billion during 
a millionth of a second. Amj^ere could not foresee that the S])eculatious 
of his imagination Avould so soon be put in so precise a form. 

Maxwell's theory, however, was not accepted without manj' reserva- 
tions; it still lacked the confirmation of experiment, for the properties 
of the dielectrics obey but in an imi^erfect manner the laws as indi- 
cated. Hertz's experiments afforded a memorable confirmation. Thanks 
to the discoveries of the inventor and the investigations of the physi- 
cists who followed in his footsteps, the demonstration is now made that 
the electric oscillations travel with the same velocity as light, that they 
produce the same phenomena of interference, that they are subject to 
the same laws of reflection and refraction; they could be iierceived by 
the eye if it were possible to give them the same frequency. That 
extreme limit is still far from being reached, since the shortest electric 
undulations that have been observed are not less than several centi- 
meters, that is, one hundred thousand times longer than those of light. 

So that all the phenomena which were at first ascribed to various 
independent causes nuist now be explained by means of the mechanical 
properties of a single medium Avhich exists in the vacuum of space, 
and is more or less modified by ponderable bodies. We have here 
a philosophical conception which is not lacking in grandeur, but which 
makes the task of the mathematicians a peculiarly hard one, and, may- 
be, extends beyond the range of the human mind. As long as it was 
only a question of imagining the structure of the medium capable of 
transmitting light the problem was comparatively easy, and yet it has 
exercised the sagacity of the most eminent men without our being yet 
able to affirm that it has been solved. What is it now, when we must 
turn for everything to a veritable Proteus"? Our successors will not 
be idle. 

While the alternate currents have taken such a prominent part in the 
development of theoretical notions, their importance in practice has 
been just as great. All the methods of producing inductive currents 
without interruption naturally supply them in the alternating form, 
because the organs that are brought into operation must revert to tlie 
same conditions, and that the two halves of each period produce effects 
in opposite directions. This alternation of the currents makes them 
for the most part unfit for use. 

At the beginning an effort was made to utilize them by means of cor- 
rectors, whose object was to drive them upon a neighboring circuit in a 
constant direction, like a torrent consisting of successive waves. These 
commutators, however, were so inconvenient that investigations con- 
tinued for forty years after Faraday's discovery without reaching any 
practical solution. 

M. Pacinotti had solved the problem in 1864 without imagining that 
his laboratory apparatus could be applied to industrial purposes. A 



THE AGE OF ELECTRICITY. 171 

haud-rail maker, M. Gramme, who was working as a joiner in electric 
works, made himself acquainted, by uncommon perseverance, with the 
machines that came under his observation. In 18G9 he devised the ad- 
mirable contrivance which justly bears the name of gramme ring, and 
accomplished actual industrial machines. 

The gramme ring is in the nature of an artifice which makes it pos- 
sible to extract from the inductive alternating effects a manner of 
rippling stream. Save a few direct applications of the alternating 
currents, as to light-houses, for instance, this may be said to have been 
the origin of industrial electricity^ A few years later, 200-horsepower 
dynamos were built. There was a 2,000-horsepower dynamo on exhi-' 
bition at Chicago. The power of these machines is boundless. Elec 
tricity receives the energy of steam engines or waterfalls, transforms 
it, utilizes it, distributes it, transmits it to long distances, again receives 
it, and returns it in the most varied forms. 

A new revolution is at hand. By a strange vicissitude of human 
afltairs we are now retracing our steps. Those alternating currents that 
seemed so fractious are now tractable. Of easier production, since they 
require no correcting device, they are transformed by raising their level, 
so that they may cover long distances at small cost, then by bringing 
the sluices down for direct api)lication. 

These are strange rivers, witli no tangible flow, whose waters move 
only by oscillation, whose alternating flow and height of fall may be 
modified at will, and that are capable of supplying at all times the 
same amount of effective power, leaving out leakage on the way and 
invisible friction. 

It was not easy to imagine that a sort of tide, the ebb and flow of 
which follow each other in less than a twenty-fifth of a second of time 
could be made available to operate hydraulic wheels and turbines. We 
now know how to do this. 

If the receiver moves in the same period as the alternating current, 
the eftects of the impulsion produced by the successive shocks are 
cumulative; the api^aratus is a synchronous motor. 

If the conductive wires bring several alternating currents, these are 
regulated so as to operate at stated intervals during a period, in the 
same manner as the two rods of a locomotive; these are the revolving 
motors. 

Other contrivances occur to our mind, but to dwell upon them would 
take up too much time. 

The Niagara Falls will, in the near future, furnish a striking illustra- 
tion of the application of electricity; 5,000- horsepower turbines, the 
most powerful ever built, will produce formidable alternating currents 
which will be easily regulated, transformed, transmitted, and availed of 
for all purposes. 

At this day electricity transmits instantaneously the human thought 
through oceans and over continents; it enables us to hear the voice

aud sentiments of our loved oues, though we maybe separated hy hun- 
dreds of miles; it finds its use in the details of our household life; it 
wins favor for a method of lighting with which oxygen is no longer 
consumed, and our dwellings are free from ofi'ensive smell; it has made 
such inroads into industrial works that it is looked ui)on as a necessity 
wherever the wise step was taken of calling upon its aid. At the same 
time it has thrown tlie notions of natural philosophy into confusion and 
put to a severe ordeal the conceptions of the human mind. 

All of this progress is of yesterday's date, and no one can tell what 
the future has in store; but whatever wonders may be witnessed by 
our successors, it could ])roperly be said that tlie nineteenth century, 
now drawing to its close, will, with good reason, be called the age of 
electricitv. 



TEKKESTEIAL MAG^^ETISM.i 



By Prof. A. W. Eucker, M.A.,F.E.S. 



. It is impossible for a body of English scientific men to meet in one 
of our ancient university towns without contrasting the old ideal of 
the pursuit of learning for its own sake with the modern conception 
of the organization of science as part of a pushing business concern. 

We are, as a nation, convinced that education is essential to national 
success. Our modern universities are within earshot of the whirr of 
the cotton mill or the roar of Piccadill}^ Oxford and Cambridge them- 
selves are not content to be centers of attraction to which scholars 
gravitate, Tliey have devised schemes by which their influence is 
directly exerted on every market town and almost on every village in 
the country. University extension is but a part of the extraordinary 
multiplication of the machinery of education which is going on all 
around us. The British Association, which was once regarded as 
bringing light into dark places, is now welcomed in every large provin- 
cial town by a group of well-known men of science; and w^e find ready 
for the meetings of our sections, not onlj' the chapels and concert rooms 
which have so often and so kindly been placed at our disposal, but all 
the appliances of well-designed lecture rooms and laboratories. 

I do not propose, however, to detain you this morning with a dis- 
course on the spread of scientific education, but you will forgive me if 
I illustrate its i^rogress by two facts, not perhaps the most striking 
which could be selected, but especially appropriate to our j)lace of 
meeting. It is little more than thirty years since the two branches of 
science with which our section deals, mathematics and physics, have 
been generally recognized as wide enough to require more than one 
teacher to cope with them in an educational institution of high preten- 
sions and achievement. In 18(50 the authorities of the Owens College, 
Manchester, debated whether it was desirable to create a professorship 
of natural philosophy in addition to, and independent of, the chair of

174 TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 

mathematics. It was tliought necessary to obtain external support for 
the opinions of those who advocated this step. An appeal was made 
to Professors De Morgan and Stokes. The former reported that a 
"course of experimental physics is in itself desirable;" the latter, that 
"there would be work enough in a large institution for a mathemati- 
cian and a physicist." 

In the end the chair of natural philosoj^hy was established, and the 
fact that our host of to-day, Professor Clifton, was its first occupant 
reminds us how little we have advanced in time and how far in educa- 
tional development from the days when propositions such as those I 
have cited were only accepted on the authority of the names of Stokes 
and De Morgan. 

The other fact to which I would refer is that the Clarendon Labora- 
tory, in which the meetings of Section A are to be held, though erected 
barely a quarter of a century ago, was the first laboratory in this coun- 
try which was specially built and designed for the study of experimen- 
tal physics. It has served as a type. Clerk Maxwell visited it while 
planning the Cavendish Laboratory, and traces of Professor Clifton's 
designs can be detected in several of our university colleges. 

But though our surroundings remind us of the improvement which 
has been effected in the equipment of our science, it would not be diffi- 
cult to indicate weak j^oints which should forthwith be strengthened. 
On these, in so far as they affect education, I will not dwell — and that 
for two reasons. In the first place, we meet to-day not as teachers, 
but as students; and, secondly, I think that whereas we have as a 
nation awoke — though late in the day — to the importance of education, 
we are not yet fully awake to the importance of learning. Our attitude 
in such matters was exactly expressed by one of the most eminent of 
the witnesses who gave evidence before the "Gresham Commission." 
In his opinion the advancement of knowledge must in a university in 
London be secondary to the higher instruction of the youth of London. 
If this be so — and I will not now dispute it — we shall surely all agree 
that somewhere or other, in London or out of it, included in our univer- 
sities or separate from them, there ought to be institutions in which the 
advancement of knowledge is regarded as of primary and fundamental 
interest, and not as a mere secondary by-product thrown off in the 
course of more imjiortant operations. 

It is not essential that in such an institution research should be the 
only task. Investigation may be combined with the routine work of 
an observatory, with teaching, with the care of standards, or with 
other similar duties. It is however essential that, if the advancement 
of knowledge is seriously regarded as an end worth attaining, it should 
not be relegated to a secondary place. 

Time and opportunity must be found for investigation, as time and 
opportunity are found for other tasks. It is not enough to refer to 
research in a prospectus and then to leave it to be accomplished at odd 



TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 175 

times and in spare moments not claimed by more urgent demands. 
Those to whom the future of the higher learning in England is dear 
must plan and scheme to promote the life-long studies of men, as in the 
last quarter of a century they have struggled, with marked success, to 
promote the preparatory studies of boys and girls. That the assign- 
ment of a secondary position to research is the more popular view, and 
that the necessity for encouraging it has as yet hardly been grasped by 
many of those who control our modern educational movements is, I fear, 
too true. It is therefore a matter for congratulation that within the 
last year Oxford has established a research degree, and has thus taken 
an important step toward gathering within her fold workers of mature 
years who are able and willing, not merely to gain knowledge, but to 
add to it. 

We may also note, with pleasure and gratitude, that the stream of 
private munificence has recently been in part directed to the advance- 
ment of learning. Sir Henry Thompson has generously ottered a sum 
of £5,000 to provide a large photographic telescope for the iS^ational 
Observatory at Greenwich. The new instrument is to be of 26 inches 
aperture and 22 feet G inches focal length, or exactly double the linear 
dimensions of that which has been previously employed. Mr. Ludwig 
Mond, too, has added to his noble gifts to science by the new research 
laboratories which he is about to establish in connection with the Royal 
Institution. Albemarle street is thronged with memories of great dis- 
coveries. The researches of Lord Rayleigh and the remarkable results 
of Professor Dewar's studies of matter at low temperatures are main- 
taining the great reputation which the Royal Institution lias gained in 
the past, and all English physicists will rejoice that prospects of new 
and extended usefulness are opeuing before it. 

Another hopeful though very embarrassing fact is that the growth 
in the number of scientific workers makes it increasingly difficult to 
find the funds which are necessary for the publication of their work. 
Up to tlie present the author of a pajier has had to submit it to criti- 
cism, but when it has been approved by competent judges it has been 
published without ado and without exj)ense to himself. This is as it 
should be. It is right that due care should be exercised to prune away 
all unnecessary matter, to reduce as far as may be the necessary cost. 
It will, however, be a great misfortune if judgment as to what curtail- 
ment is necessary is in future passed, not with the object of removing 
what is really superfluous but in obedience to the iron rule of poverty. 
Apart from all other disadvantages, such a course would add to the 
barriers which are dividing the students of different sciences. A few 
lines and a rough diagram may suffice to show to experts what has 
been attempted and what achieved ; but there is no paper so difficult 
to master as that which assumes that the reader starts from the point 
of vantage which months or years of study have enabled the author to 
attain. Undue pruning w.ill not make the tree of knowledge more 
fruitful, land will certainly make it harder to climb. 



176 TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 

Couuected also with the vast increase of scientific literatnre is a 
growing necessity for the publication of volumes of abstracts, in which 
the main results of recent investigations are presented in a concen- 
trated form, English chemists have long been supplied with these by 
the Chemical Society. The Physical Society, thougii far less wealthy 
than its elder sister, has determined to undertake a similar task. We 
are compelled to begin cautiously, but in January next the first number 
of a monthly pamphlet will be issued containing abstracts of all the 
papers which appear in the principal foreign journals of physics. In 
this venture the society will incur grave responsibilities, and I avail 
myself of this opportunity to appeal to all British physicists to sup- 
port us in a work the scope of which will be rapidly extended if our 
first efforts succeed. 

From this brief glance at what has been or is about to be done to 
promote the study of physics I must now turn to the discussion of nar- 
rower but more definite problems, and I j)resume that I shall be most 
likely to deserve your attention if I select a subject in which I am 
myself especially interested. 

During the last ten years my friend Dr. Thorp and I have been 
eu^gaged upon a minute magnetic survey of the United Kingdom. The 
main conclusions at which we have arrived are about to be published, 
and I do not proi)ose to recount them now. It is, however, impossible 
to give so long a time to a single research without having one's atten- 
tion drawn to a number of points which require further investigation, 
and I shall perhaps be making the best use of this opportunity if I 
bring to your notice some matters in the practical and theoretical study 
of terrestrial magnetism which deserve a fuller consideration than has 
yet been given to them. 

In the first place, then, there is little doubt that the instruments at 
I)resent used for measuring declination and horizontal force are affected 
with errors far greater than the error of observation. 

We employed four magnetometers by Elliott Brothers, which were 
frequently compared with the standard instrument at Kew. These 
measurements proved that the instrumental differences which affect the 
accuracy of the declination and horizontal force measurements are from 
five to ten times as great as the error of a single field observation. The 
dip circle which two generations ago was so untrustworthy, is, in our 
experience, the most satisfactory of the absolute instruments. 

In most cases these comparisons extended over several days, but the 
astronomer royal has described in his recent report observations made 
at Greenwich for two years and a half with two horizontal force instru- 
ments. These differ between themselves, and the discrepancy is of the 
same order of magnitude as those we have detected. 

If such diflerences exist between instruments of the Kew pattern, it 
is probable that they will be still greater when the magnetometers 
under investi^-atioij ar§ of different types. 



TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 177 

This point has been investigated by Dr. Van Eijckevorsel, who five 
yeai\s ago visited Kew, Pare St. Maur, Wilhelmshaven, and Utrecht, 
and, using his own instruments at each place, compared the values of 
the magnetic elements determined by himself with those deduced from 
the self registering apparatus of the observatory. 

The discrepancies between the so called standards which were thus 
brought to light were quite startling and j^rove the necessity for an 
investigation as to their causes. 

Magneticians had long been aware that the instruments used by 
travelers should be compared at the beginning and end of a journey 
with those at some fixed observatory to make sure that the compara- 
tively rough usage to which they are subjected has not affected their 
indications. But Dr. Van Eijckevorsel's expedition first drew general 
attention to the fact that there are serious dififereuces between the 
standard observatory instruments themselves. 

The importance of a careful comparison between them was at once 
recognized. The magnetic subcommittee of the International Meteor- 
ological Conferen(;e held at Munich in the autumn of 1891 resolved 
that it is " necessary that the instruments employed for absolute meas- 
urements at the difl'erent observatories should be compared with each 
other and the results published." As far as I am aware nothing has 
been done to 'give effect to this resolution, but the necessity for such 
an international comparison is urgent. The last few years have been 
a period of unexampled activity in the conduct of local magnetic sur- 
veys. To cite instances from the northwest of Europe only, observa- 
tions have recently been made on a more or less extended scale in the 
United Kingdom, France, Holland, North Germany, and Denmark. 

It will be absurd if these surveys can not be collated and welded into 
a homogeneous whole, because we are in doubt whether the indications 
of our standard instruments for the measurement of declination and 
dip differ by five or six minutes of arc. 

If, however, an official international comparison of the magnetic 
standards in use in different countries is instituted it is probable that 
only one observatory in each country Avill take part in it. 

It may fairly be left to each nation to determine for itself the rela- 
tions between the results of measurements made in its own institutions* 
Apart, therefore, from all other reasons, we in England would only be 
able to make the best use of an international comparison if we had 
beforehand set our own house in order and were able at once to extend 
the results of experiments made at Kew or Greenwich to Stonyhurst, 
Valentia, and Falmouth. 

This we are not at the jiresent moment in a position to do. As far 
as I know nobody has ever carried a magnetometer backward and 
forward between Kew and Greenwich to test the concordance of the 
published results. During the recent survey single or double sets of 
observations have been made at Stonyhurst, Falmouth, and Valentia,

witli instruments wliiclihave been compared witli Kew, but these meas- 
urements, tliongb amply sufficient for the purposes of our research, were 
not numerous enough to serve as a firm basis for determining the dis- 
crepancies between the various standards, so tliat the exact rehitions 
between these important sets of apparatus are still unknown. 

The first point, therefore, to which I wish to draw the attention of 
the section is the necessity for a full primary comparison between the 
standard magnetic instruments in use at our different observatories. 

But if this were satisfiictorily accomplished the question would arise 
as to whether it should be repeated at regular intervals. We have at 
jireseut only a presumption in favor of the view that the standards 
which W'e know are discordant are nevertheless constant. A single 
instance may suffice to show how necessary it may be — at all events in 
the case of outlying and isolated observatories — to put this belief to the 
test. 

In the most recent account of the work of the observatory of the 
Bombay government at Colaba, the dips are discussed for the period 
of twenty years between 1872 and 1892. During this interval the 
adjustment of the agate i^lates upon which the dip needle rolls has 
thrice been modified. In 1877 the plates were renewed. In 1881 and 
1887 the dip circle was taken to pieces and rebuilt. In the intervals 
the dip as determined by several needles, but always with this circle, 
remained approximately constant, but after each overhauling it sud- 
denly altered, increasing by 12 minutes on the first occasion, by 23 min- 
utes on the second, and by 20 minutes on the third. Mr. Chambers 
states that he "can give no satisfactory account of this behavior of 
the instrument," but suggests that "the needle gradually hollows out 
a depression in the agate i^lates on which it rolls, and that this charac- 
teristic of the dip circle" has not before been discovered owing to the 
reluctance of magnetic observers to interfere with the. adjustment of 
instruments which are apparently working well. 

I do not think that this explanation will suffice. Dr. Thorpe and I 
employed a new dip circle in the earliest part of our survey work, which 
has remained in accord with Kew for ten years. During that time the 
dip has been measured some seven hundred times with it. This cor- 
responds, I believe, to more than the amount of work done with the 
circle at Colaba in six years, which in turn is longer than some of the 
intervals in which the Colaba instruments gave results erroneous to the 
extent of 20 minutes. I feel, therefore, quite sure that the difficulties 
which have been experienced at Bombay are not due to any "charac- 
teristic defect of the dip circle." But whatever the cause may have 
been, surely the lesson is that, if such things can happen in so well- 
known an institution, it is desirabh^ that we should take the moderate 
pains required to assure ourselves whether smaller — but, possibly, not 
unimportant — errors are gradually aflecting the results at any of our 
observatories. 



TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 179 

This brings me to my next point, namely, that if we are to draw con- 
chisions from the minor differences between measnrements of secular 
or diurnal change made in the observatories, it is not only necessary 
that we should know whether the instruments are strictly comparable 
and constant, but the observations must be reduced by precisely the 
same methods. 

In 1886 the late Mr. Whipple drew the attention of the British Asso- 
ciation to the fact that there was a systematic difference between the 
diurnal ranges of declination at Greenwich and Kew. His results were 
based on the three years 1870-1872. In 1890 two of my students, Messrs. 
Eobson. and S. W. J. Smith, extended the comparison to three more 
recent years (1883, 1886, 1887), and obtained results in complete accord 
with those of Mr. Whipple. 

It is well known that the average daily oscillation of the magnet is 
affected by the magnetic weather. Sabine showed that magnetic 
storms do not merely buffet the needle now in this direction and now 
in that — they affect its average behavior, so that the mean swing east 
and west is different according as we deduce it only from days of mag- 
netic calm or include those of storm. 

Mr. Whipple reduced the Kew observations by two methods,' one of 
which depended on the calmest days only, while the other included 
those which were moderately disturbed. Neither agreed exactly with 
the method in use at Greenwich, but the difference between the 
results deduced from them was so small when compared with the differ- 
ence between either and that obtained at Greenwich, that it seemed 
possible that the diurnal variations, even at these closely neighboring 
places, might differ appreciably. The question whether this is so has 
now been answered. In 1890, at the request of the Kew committee, 
the astronomer royal undertook to select early in each year five quiet 
days in each of the preceding twelve months. It was also agreed that, 
whether they adopted other methods or not, the chief English magnetic 
observatories should determine the diurnal variations from these days 
alone. The Greenwich ^ and Kew observations for 1890 have therefore 
been worked up in exactly the same way, with the result that the dis- 
crepancy, which had persisted for twenty years, has entirely disap- 
peared, and that the two diurnal ranges at the two observatories are 
in as close accord as could be expected. 

If, therefore, we may judge from a single year, the cause of the dif- 
ference lay in the choice of days. Greenwich will in future give us two 
diurnal variations, one obtained from the most quiet days only, the 
other from all days except those of violent storm, and in these we shall 
have most valuable data for studying the mean effect of disturbances 
on the diurnal variation. 

To this satisfactory conclusion I have only one suggestion to add. 
The astronomer royal and M. Mascart now publish for the same stormy

days tbe ])hotograpliic traces by which tlie history of a niajjnetic storm 
is mapped. Is it possible for Greenwich and Paris also to agree in 
their choice of calm days for the calculation of the diurnal variation 
so that a precise similarity of method may obtain not only between 
the English observatories but between England and France? 

The importance of cooperation between institutions engaged on the 
same tasks having been illustrated, I am glad to be able to announce 
that another step is about to be taken in the same direction. For some 
years, in spite, I believe, of great linancial difficulties, the Cornwall 
Royal Polytechnic Society has maintained a magnetic observatory at 
Falmouth. The results of the observations have hitherto been printed 
in the journal of the society only, but the Royal Society has now con- 
sented to iHiblish them in the Proceedings. Before long, therefore, the 
Kew and Falmouth records, which are already worked up in the same 
way, will be given to the world side by side. Is it too much to hope 
that this may be the first step toward the production of a British 
Magnetic Year Book, in Avhich observations whose chief interest lies in 
their comparison may be so published as to be easily compared? 

We owe to private enterprise another advance of the same kind. 
The managers of the new journal Science Progress have made arrange- 
ments with the Kew committee for the yearly publication of a table 
showing the mean annual values of the magnetic elements as deter- 
mined at the various magnetic observatories of the world. It will 
therefore in future be possible to get a general idea of the rate of 
secular change in different localities without searching through a 
number of reports in ditferent languages, which can only be consulted 
in the rooms of the few societies or institutions to which they are 
annually sent. The present state of our knowledge of the secular 
change in the magnetic elements afibrds, indeed, very strong support 
to the arguments I have already adduced in favor of a comparison 
between the instruments of our magnetic observatories. 

The whole question of the cause of this phenomenon has entered on 
a new stage. It has long been recognized that the earth is not a simple 
magnet, but that there are in each hemisphere one pole or point at which 
the dip needle is vertical and two foci of maximum intensity. A com- 
parison of earlier with later magnetic observations led to the conclusion 
that one or both of the foci in each hemisphere is in motion, and that to 
this motion, however caused, the secular change in the values of the 
magnetic element is due. Thus the late Prof. Balfour Stewart, writing 
in 1883, says: "While there is no well-established evidence to show that 
either the pole of verticity or the center of force to the north of Amer- 
ica has perceptibly changed its place, there is on the other hand very 
strong evidence to show that we have a change of iilace on the part of 
the Siberian focus." ^ The facts in favor of this conclusion are there dis- 
cussed. The arguments are based, not on the results of any actual 

' Encyclopajtlia Brit., 9tli ed., art. "Meteorology — Terrestrial magnetism." 



TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 181 

observations near to the focus iu question, but on the behavior of the 
magnet at points far distant from it in Europe and Asia. The westerly 
march of tlie decIina;tion needle, which lasted in England up to 1818, 
and the easterly movement which has since replaced it, are connected 
with a supposed easterly motion of the Siberian focus, which, it is 
added, "there is some reason to believe - - - has recently been 
reversed." In opposition, therefore, to the idea of the rotation of a 
magnetic focus round the geographical poles which the earlier magne- 
ticians adopted, Stewart seems to have regarded the motion of the 
Siberian focus as oscillatory. 

A very different aspect is put upon the matter by a comparison of 
the magnetic maps of the world prepared by Sabine and Creak for the 
epochs 1840 and 1880, resi)ectively. Captain Creak, having undertaken 
to report on the magnetic observations made during the voyage of the 
Challenger, supplemented them with the unrivaled wealth of recorded 
facts at the disposal of the hydrographic department of the Admiralty. 
He was thus able, by a comparison with Sabine's map, to trace the gen- 
eral course of the secular changes all over the world for forty years. 
The negative results may be shortly stated. There is no evidence of 
any motion either of magnetic pole or focus. The positive conchisions 
are still more curious. There are certain lines on the surface of the 
earth toward which in the interval under consideration the north pole 
of the needle was attracted. From each side the compass veered or 
backed toward them. Above them the north pole of dip needle moved 
steadily down. 

There are other lines frqm which, as tested by compass and dip circle, 
a north pole was in like manner repelled. The two principal points 
of increasing attraction are in China and near Cape Horn; the chief 
points of growing repulsion are in the north of Canada and the Gulf of 
Guinea. 

I am sure that my friend Captain Creak would be the first to urge 
that we should not generalize too hastily from this mode of present- 
ing the facts, but there can be no doubt that they can not be explained. 
by any simple theory of a rotating or oscillating pair of poles. Prima 
facie they suggest that the secular change is due not so much to changes 
at the principal magnetic points as to the waxing and waning of the 
forces apparently exerted by secondary lines or points of attraction or 
repulsion. 

All down the west coast of America, close, be it noted, to one of the 
great lines of volcanic activity, north hemisphere magnetism has since 
1840 been growing in relative imi^ortance. Near Cape Horn a weak 
embryonic pole is developing of the same kind as the well-known i^ole 
at the other end of the continent near Hudson Bay. Along a line which 
joins Newfoundland to the Cape of Good Hope precisely the reverse 
effects have been experienced; while in the Gulf of Guinea a south 
hemisj)here pole is growing within the Tropics. Of course I do not 



182 TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 

suggest that these secondary systems can ever determine the principal 
phenomena of terrestrial magnetism, or reverse the magnetic states of 
the hemispheres in which they occur. These are no doubt fixed by the 
rotation of the earth. I do, however, wish to emphasize the fact that 
they show that either secular change is due to the conjoint action of 
local causes, or that if some single agent such as a current system within 
the earth, or a change of magnetic conditions outside it, be the primary 
cause, the effects of this cause are modified and complicated by local 
peculiarities. 

Mr. Henry Wilde has succeeded in rei)resenting with approximate 
accuracy the secular change at many points on the surface of the earth 
by placing two systems of currents within a globe, and imparting to 
the axis of one of them a motion of rotation about the polar axis of the 
earth. But he has had to supplement this compariti vely simple arrange- 
ment by local features. He has coated the seas with thin sheet iron. 
The ratio between the two currents which serves to depict the secular 
change near the meridian of Greenwich fails in the West Indies. Ihus 
this ingenious attempt to imitate the secular change by a simple rota- 
tion of the magnetic pole sup})orts the view that local peculiarities 
play a powerful irdvt in modifying the action of a simple first cause, if 
such exist. I need hardly say that I think the proper attitude of mind 
on this difficult subject is that of suspended judgment, but there is no 
doubt that recent investigation has, at all events, definitely raised the 
question how far secular change is either due to, or modified by, special 
magneto features of different parts of the earth. 

It is possible that light may be thrown ui)on this point by observa- 
tions on a smaller scale. Assuming for the moment that the difference 
in the secular changes on opposite sides of the Atlantic is due to a dif- 
ference of local causes, it is conceivable that similar causes, though 
less powerful and acting through smaller ranges, might produce similar 
though less obvious differences between places only a few miles apart. 
For testing this Greenwich and Kew are in many respects most favora- 
bly situated. JSTo where else are two first-class observatories so near 
together. Differences in the methods of publishing the results have 
made it somewhat difficult to compare them, but the late Mr. Whipple 
furnished me with figures for several years, which made comparison 
easy. Without entering into details it may be sufficient to say that 
the declination needles at the two i)laces do not from year to year run 
parallel courses. Between 1880 and 1882 Kew outstripped its rival; 
between 1885 and 1889 it lost, so that the gain was rather more than 
compensated. The difference of the declination of the two places 
appears to increase and diminish through a range of 5 minutes of arc. 

This evidence can be supplemented by other equally significant 
examples. Ko fact connected with terrestrial magnetism is more cer- 
tain than that at present the rate of secular change of declination in 
this part of Europe increases as we go north. This is shown by a com- 



TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 183 

parisou of our survey with those of our predecessors fifty and thirty 
years ago, by M. Moureaux's results in France, and by Captain Creak's 
collation of previous observations. Yet, in spite of this, Stonyhurst, 
which is some 200 miles north of Greenwich and Kew, and should there- 
fore outrun them, sometimes lags behind and then makes up for lost 
time by prodigious bounds. Between 1882 and 1886 the total secular 
change of declination at Stonyhurst was about 3.5 minutes less than 
that at Greenwich and Kew, whereas in the two years, 1890-92, it 
reached at Stonyhurst the enormous amount of 28 minutes, just doub- 
ling the corresj)ondiug alteration registered in the same time at Kew. 
If these fluctuations are caused by the instruments or methods of re- 
duction, my argument in favor of frequent comparisons and uniform 
treatment would be much strengthened, but, apart from the inherent 
improbability of such large differences being due to the methods of 
observation, the i^robability of their physical reality is increased by 
the work of the magnetic survey. 

The large number of observations at our disposal has enabled us to 
calculate the secular change in a new way, by taking the means of 
observations made about five years apart at numerous though not iden- 
tical stations scattered over districts about 150 miles square. The 
result thus obtained should be free from mere local variations, but as 
calculated for the southeast of England for the five years 1886-91, it 
diff"ers by nearly 5 minutes from the change actually observed at Kew. 

We have also determined the secular change at twenty-five stations 
by double sets of observations made as nearly as possible on the same 
spot at intervals of several years. The results must be interpreted 
with caution. In districts such as Scotland, where strong local dis- 
turbances are frequent, a change of a few yards in the position of the 
observer might introduce errors far larger than the fluctuations of 
secular change. But when all such changes are eliminated, when all 
allowance is made for the possible inaccuracy of field observations, 
there are outstanding variations which can hardly be due to anything 
but a real difference in the rate of change of the magnetic elements. 

A single example will suffice. St. Leonards and Tunbridge Wells 
are about 30 miles apart. Both are situated on the Hastings Sand for- 
mation, and on good nonmagnetic observing ground. At them, as at 
the stations immediately around them — Lewes, Eastbourne, Appledore, 
Etchingham, Heathfield, and Maidstone — the local disturbing forces 
are very small. All these places lie within a district about 40 miles 
square, at no point of which has the magnet been found to deviate by 
5 minutes from the true magnetic meridian. ISTo region could be more 
favorably situated for the determination of the secular change, yet 
according to our observations the alteration in the declination at St. 
Leonards in six years was practically equal to that at Tunbridge Wells 
in five. It is difficult to assign so great a variation to an accumulation 
of errors, and this is only one among several instances of the same 
kind which might be quoted. 



l84 TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 

We find, then, when we consider the earth as a whole, grave reason 
to question the ohl idea of a secular change caused by a magnetic pole 
or focus pursuing an orderly orbit around the geographical axis of the 
earth, or oscillating in some regalar period in its neighborhood. It 
would of course be absurd to admit the possibility of change in the 
Tropics and to deny that possibility in the Arctic circle, but the new 
facts lead us to look upon the earth not as magnetically inert, but as 
itself — at the equator as well as at the pole — producing or profoundly 
modifying the influences which give rise to secular change. And 
then, when we push our inquiry further, accumulating experience tells 
the same tale. The earth seems, as it were, alive with magnetic forces, 
be they due to electric currents or to variations in the state of magnet- 
ized matter. We need not now consider the sudden jerks which dis- 
turb the diurnal sweep of the magnet, which are simultaneous at 
places far apart, and i^robably originate in causes outside our globe. 
But the slower secular change, of which the small part that has been 
observed has taken centuries to accomplish, is apparently also inter- 
fered with by some slower agency the action of which is confined 
within narrow limits of space. Between Kew, Greenwich, and Stony- 
hurst, between St. Leonards and Tunbridge Wells, ami I may add, 
between Mablethorpe and Lincoln, Enniskillen and Sligo, Charleville 
and Bantry, the measured diftercnces of secular variation are so large 
as to suggest that we are dealing not with an nnrulfled tide of change, 
which, unaltered by its passage over continent or ocean, sweeps slowly 
round the earth, but with a current fed by local springs or impeded by 
local obstacles, furrowed on the surface by billows and eddies, from 
which the magnetician, if he will but study them, may learn much as 
to the position and meaning of the deeps and the shallows below. 
But if this is the view which the facts I have quoted suggest, much 
remains to be done before it can be finally accepted; and in the first 
place — to come back to the j^oint from which I started — we want, for 
some years at all events, a systematic and repeated comparison of the 
standard instruments in use at the different observatories. That they 
are not in accord is certain; whether the relations between them are 
constant or variable is doubtful. If constant, the suggestions I have 
outlined are probably correct; if variable, then the whole or part of 
the apparent fluctuations of secular change may be nothing more than 
the irregular shiftings of inconstant standards. 

I can not myself believe that this is the true explanation, but in any 
case it is important that the doubt should be set at rest, and that if 
the apparent fluctuations of secular change are not merely instru- 
mental, the iuc^uiry as to their cause should be undertaken in good 
earnest. 

The question is interesting from another point of view. It is now 
fully established that even where the surface soil is nonmagnetic, and 
even where geologists have every reason to believe that it lies upon 



Terrestrial magketism. 185 

nonmagnetic strata of great thickness, there are clearly defined lines 
and centers toward wliich the north-seeking pole of a magnet is 
attracted, or from which it is repelled. To the magnetic surveyor tlnc- 
tuations in secular change would ai)pear as variations in the positions 
of these lines, or as changes in the forces in play in their neighborhood. 

Greenwich and Kew are both under the influence of a widespread 
local disturbance which culminates near Eeading. At both pLices the 
needle is deviated to the west of the normal magnetic meridian, and if 
the westerly declination diminishes sometimes faster and sometimes 
more slowly at one observatory than at the other, this must be, or, at 
all events, would in the first instance apjjear to be, due to local changes 
in the regional disturbing forces. The questions of the nature of the 
irregularities of secular change and of the causes of local disturbances 
are therefore intermingled, and information gained on these points may 
in turn be useful in solving the more difficult problem of world-wide 
secular variations. 

Two causes of regional and local disturbances have been suggested, 
viz, earth currents and the presence of visible or concealed magnetic 
rocks. The two theories are not mutually exclusive. Both causes of 
the observed effects may, and probably do, coexist. I have, however, 
elsewhere explained my reasons for believing that the presence of 
magnetic matter, magnetized by induction in the earth's held, is the 
principal cause of the existence of the magnetic ridge-lines and foci 
of attraction which for so many years we have been carefully tracing. 
I will only now mention what appears to me to be the final and conclu- 
sive argument, which, since it was first enunciated, lias been strength- 
ened by the results of our more recent work. We find that every great 
mass of basic rock, by which the needle is affected at considerable dis- 
tances, attracts the north-seeking i)ole. Captain Creak some years ago 
showed that the same statement is true of those islands in the ]Srorthern 
Hemisphere which disturb the lines of equal declination, while islands 
in the Southern Hemisphere rei)el the north pole and attract the south. 
In other words, these disturbances are inmiediately explained if we 
suppose that they are dim to magnetic matter magnetized by induction. 
The theory of earth currents would, on the other hand, require that 
round the masses of visible basalt, and round the island investigated 
by Captain Creak, currents, or eddies in currents, should circulate in 
directions which ai"e always the same in the same hemisphere, and 
always opposed on opposite sides of the equator. For this supposition 
no satisfactory explanation is forthcoming, and, therefore, with all 
reserve and a full consciousness that in such matters hypothesis differs 
but little from speculation, it appears to me that the theory that 
induced magnetism is the main cause of the dfsturbance has the greater 
weight of evidence in its favor. 

If this be granted, it is evident that the positions of the main lines 
and centers of attraction would be approximately constant, and, so far 



186 TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 

as it is possible to form an opinion, tliese conditions seem to be satisfied. 
There lias certainly been no noticeable change in the chief loci of attrac- 
tion in the five years which have elapsed bet^yeen the epochs of our two 
surveys. Mr. Welsh's observations made in Scotland in 1857-58 fit in 
well with our own. Such evidence is not, however, inconsistent with 
minor changes, and it is certain that as the directions and magnitude of 
the inducing forces alter, the disturbing induced orces must alter also. 
But this change would be slow, and as the horizontal force is in these 
latitudes comparatively weak, the change in the disturbing forces 
would also be small, unless the vertical force altered greatly. It is at 
all events impossible to attribute to this cause oscillations which occupy 
at most eight or ten years. It is possible to suggest other changes 
in the state of the concealed magnetic matter, alterations of pressure, 
temperature, and the like, to which the oscillations of secular change 
might be due, but i:»robably there will be a general consensus of opinion 
that if the slowly changing terms in the disturbance function are due 
to magnetic matter, the more rapid fluctuations of a few years' i^eriod 
are more likely to be connected with earth currents. It becomes there- 
fore a matter of interest to disentangle the two constituents of local 
disturbances; and there is one (juestion to which I think an answer 
might be obtained without a greater expenditure than the importance 
of the investigation warrants. Are the local variations in secular 
change waves which move from place to place, or are they stationary 
fluctuations, each of which is confined to a limited area beyond which 
it never travels? Thus if the annual decrease in the declination is at 
one time more rapid at Greenwich than at Kew, and five years after- 
wards more rapid at Kew than at Greenwich, has the maximum of 
rapidity passed in the interval through all intervening places, or has 
there been a dividing line of no change which has separated two dis- 
tricts which have i^erhaps been the scenes of independent variations? 
The answer to this question is, I take it, outside the range of our 
knowledge now, but if the declination could be determined several 
times annually at each of a limited number of stations in the neighbor- 
hood of London, to this inquiry, at all events, a definite answer would 
soon be furnished. 

There are two other lines of investigation which I hope will be taken 
up sooner or later, for one of which it is doubtful whether the United 
Kingdom is the best site, while the other is of uncertain issue. 

If, however, it be granted that the principal cause of local and regional 
magnetic disturbances is the magnetization by the earth's field of mag- 
netic matter concealed below its surface, the question as to the nature 
of this material still remains to be solved. Is it virgin iron or pure 
magnetite, or is it merely a magnetic rock of the same nature and prop- 
erties as the basalts which are found in Skye and Mull? There is of 
course no a priori reason why all these difterent materials should not 
be active, some in one place and some in another. 



TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 187 

As regards the United Kingdom 1 liave, both in a i>ai)er on the 
"Permeability of magnetic rocks" and in the description of the recent 
survey, made cak'ulations which tend to prove that if we suppose that 
the temperature of the interior of the earth is, at a depth of 12 miles, 
such as to deprive matter of its magnetic properties, and if we further 
make the unfavorable assumption that down to that limit the suscepti- 
bility is constant, the forces which are observed on the surface are of 
the same order of magnitude as those which could be produced by 
large masses of ordinary basalt or gabbro. It would not, however, be 
wise to generalize this result and to assume that in all places regional 
disturbances are due to basic rocks alone. 

We know that local effects are produced by iron ore, for the Swedish 
miners seek for iron with the aid of the magnet, and in some other 
cases magnetic disturbances of considerable range are so intense as to 
suggest that material of very high magnetic permeability must be 
present. 

If the concealed magnetic matter were iron, and if it were present in 
large quantity, it is evident that the results of experiments with the 
magnetometer and dip circle might be supplemented by observations 
made with the i)lumb line or pendulum. In such a case the region of 
magnetic disturbance would also be a region of abnormal gravitational 
attraction. An account of a suggested connection between anomalies 
of these two kinds occurring in the same district has lately been pub- 
lished by Dr. Fritsche.^ 

Observations made about thirty years ago by a former director of 
the Astronomical Observatory in Moscow led to the conclusion that 
throughout two large districts to the north and south of that city the 
plumb line is deviated in opposite directions. The deflections from 
the vertical are very considerable, and indicate a relative defect in the 
attraction exerted by the rocks in the neighborhood of Moscow itself, 
and the suggestion has been made that there is either a huge cavity — 
a bubble in the earth crust — under the town, or that the matter beneath 
it is less dense than that which underlies the surface strata on either 
side at a distance of 10 or 12 miles. 

As long ago as 1853 Captain Meyen made magnetic observations in 
order to determine whether the same district is also the seat of any 
magnetic irregularity. His stations were hardly sufficiently numerous 
to lead to decisive results, but the magnetic elements have recently 
been measured by Dr. Fritsche at thirty -one places within 50 miles of 
Moscow. The exi>eriments were all made witliin eleven days, so that 
no correction for secular change is required. They indicate a locus of 
magnetic attraction running through Moscow itself. South of the 
town the disturbance again changes in direction so as to show either

that rejiulsive forces are in play, or that there is another magnetic 
ridge line still farther to the south. Dr. Fritsche thinks that these 
observations explain the gravitational anomalies without recourse to 
the somewhat forced hypothesis of a vast subterranean cave. He 
assumes that there is a concealed mass of iron which approaches near to 
the surface at Moscow and also along two loci to the south and north of 
the city. He attributes the magnetic irregularities to the attraction 
of the central iron hill, the detlections of the plumb line to the flanking 
masses. It is perhaps not inconceivable that such results might follow 
in a special case, but without the support of calculation it certainly 
appears that the magnetic experiments point to the existence of the 
principal attracting mass under the town. This is in fact the arrange- 
ment shown in the figure with which Dr. Fritsche illustrates his 
hypothesis. If this is so, the theory would prima facie seem to require 
that the bob of a plumb line should be attracted toward and not, as 
is actually the case, away from the center of the magnetic disturbance. 
On the whole, then, though the coexistence of large magnetic and 
gravitational disturbances in the same place is suggestive, I do not 
think that they have as yet been proved to be different eifects of the 
same hidden mass of magnetic matter. 

In a few weeks an international geodetic conference will meet at 
lunspruck, at which the Royal Society will be represented. It is, I 
believe, intended to extend the detailed investigation of the relations 
between the nature of the earth's crust and the gravitational and 
magnetic forces to which it gives rise. We may therefore hope that 
special attention will before long be given to localities where both 
may combine to give information as to facts outside the range of the 
ordinary methods of geology. 

The second phenomenon on which more light is desirable is the per- 
manent magnetization of magnetic rocks. It is known that fragments 
of these are strongly but irregularly magnetized, but that the effect of 
very large masses at a distance appears to be due to induced rather 
than to permanent magnetism. There are three questions to which I 
should like an answer: Are underground masses of magnetite ever 
permanently magnetized ? Are large areas of surface masses — say a few 
hundred square yards in extent — ever permanently and approximately 
uniformly magnetized in the same sense? Is there any relation between 
the geological age and the direction of the permanent magnetism of 
magnetic rocks'? 

Inquiries such as these can only be taken up by individual workers, 
but I venture to think that the comparison of the observatory instru- 
ments and the fluctuations of secular change outside the observato- 
ries could best be investigated under the auspices of a great scientific 
society. The cooperation of the authorities of the observatories will 
no doubt be secured, but it is most important that the comparison 



TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 189 

should in all cases be made with one set of instruments and by the 
same methods. Whether the British Association, which for so long 
managed a magnetic observatory, may think that it could usefully inau- 
gurate the work it would be improper for me in a presidential address to 
forecast. Who does it is of less importance than that it should be done, 
and 1 can not but hope that the arguments and instances which 1 have 
to-day adduced may help to bring about not only the doing of the work, 
but the doing of it quickly. 






PHOTOGRAPHIC PHOTOMETRY. ^ 



By M. J. Janssen. 



A dozen years ago I undertook to lay the foundations of a science 
of photographic photometry, with special reference to its application 
to astronomical physics. I applied the fundamental principle of my 
researches — a principle to be restated below — to the measurement of 
the comparative intensities of solar and lunar light, to that of the earth 
light on the moon, to the radiating activity of the sun as compared 
with several stars, notably Sirius, and finally to the law of decrement 
of the light in passing away from the head along the tail of the comet 
C of 1881, which had been photographed at Meudon, the first among 
such bodies. 

Perhaps these researches were not as energetically followed up by 
me as they ought to have been, for their astronomical importance is 
great, and they might have furnished valuable terms of comparison for 
the future. But I have had the satisfaction of seeing the princiijle 
adopted by the International Congress of Photometry for the measures 
of photometric order for which they laid down the rules. In order 
to renew attention to the subject, I here reproduce a resume of my 
researches, wishing that it may become the starting point of new inves- 
tigations. 

Photometry has to determine the ratio of intensities of two lights. 
For example, to determine the ratio of luminosity of a candle and a 
Carcel lamp is one jiroblem of photometry, and to evaluate in Carcel 
lamps the power of an electric source of luminous radiation is another. 

We often have to make comparisons of this sort in the heavens. They 
are always highly interesting and sometimes lead to beautiful discov- 
eries. Thus, we know that the moon is an opaque ball not self-luminous, 
but shining because lit up by the sun's rays. Now, we may ask what 
proportion of the incident light it remits, in what measure the surface 
shows specular reflection, and what is the relative amount of light of 
the full moon as compared with that of the luminary from which its 
rays are borrowed. Independent of the curiosity of such data in them- 
selves, it is clear that if the study of them is carried deep enough it 
may lead to important conclusions relative to the nature of materials at 
the surface of the moon.

So, also, tbe study of the planets would be advanced by photometric 
observations which should afford a knowledge of the relations of their 
surfjices and atmospheres to light. 

A special importance attaches to photographic photometry in its 
ai)plication to the tixed stars. The quantity of light a star sends us 
depends chiefly on its distance and its radiating power, so that either 
of these two factors being known the apparent light will determine the 
other. Thus, if the parallax of a star and the amount of light which it 
sends to us are known, we can deduce the intrinsic amount of its radia- 
tion—that is to say, its rank among the hosts of suns with which the 
spaces of heaven are sown. Add to this knowledge that of the qualities 
of its light, and you will have a total from which the magnitude, the 
constitution, and the activity of the luminary in question may be almost 
completely defined. 

Similar remarks apply to comets and uebuhe. Thus, celestial pho- 
tometry constitutes one of the most important methods of astronomy; 
and it is very interesting to see what aid it can derive from photog- 
raphy. For this purpose I have employed a method which I proceed 
to describe.' We know that in the common photometric method the 
ratio of emission of the two sources of light is obtained by removing 
the brighter of them until they each illuminate the shadow due to the 
other equally. This is one of numerous methods not hitherto used in 
photographic photometry. In a photograph, in order to judge of the 
brightness of a luminous or illuminated body, we have nothing but 
its i)hotographic action, or the greater or less oi^acity of the metallic 
deposit which it occasions on the sensitive film. Now, the blackness 
of this deposit is very far from being proportional to the time of action 
of the light. Could we see the deposit increase, and could we measure 
its amount while the action of a steady light was going on, we should 
find that it increased rapidly at first, and afterwards slower and slower, 
until it became practically stationary. Thus, we can not take as meas- 
ure of the intensity of a source of light the degree of opacity of the 
metallic deposit which it occasions, since that opacity is not propor- 
tional to its action during a determinate time. But if, in place of con- 
sidering the different degrees of opacity in relation to equalitj^ of the 
time of action, we consider on the contrary the variable time necessary 
to obtain a deposit of one fixed oi^acity, we shall have a sure basis for 
the comparisons, and this, in fact, api)ears from experiment. 

The fact is, that to produce in a sensitive film a metallic deposit of 
given blackness a certain sum of radiant action is needed, and whether 
this sum is brought into existence in a longer or shorter time makes no 
difference. Hence it follows that the energy of a source is increased 
by the time necessary to effect the given degree of blackness — that is to 
say, according to this principle, two sources are to one another inversely

as the times they occupy in producing n given shade upon tlie same 
sensitive film, or in other words, to produce equal photographic effects. 

This is the principle I have adopted in my investigations into photo- 
graphic photometry. I have assured myself experimentally of the 
legitimacy of this principle by ascertaining the relative amounts of 
tune necessary to obtain tints of the same opacity on one sensitive film 
placed at increasing distances of the source of liglit. It is found that 
these times increase as the squares of the distances. Thus, for dis- 
tances 1, 2, 3, 4 - - - 8, etc., the times are in the ratio of 1, 4, 9, 
16 - - - 64, etc. It is necessary to Avork with one and the same 
film, to avoid all stray light, to develop the plates in one bath, and, 
in a word, to use all precautions possible in order to establish this law. 
We may also mention that to obtain the best results possible it is need- 
ful to take care to choose the opacity which corresponds to the most 
rapid variation which happens toward the beginning of the action. 

Let us see how this method can be applied to the photometric study 
of the heavenly bodies. 

For a long time astronomers and physicists have sought to determine 
the luminous intensity of the moon relatively to that of the sun. 
Bonguer appears to be the one who came nearest to the truth. Employ- 
ing a candle as middle term of the comparison, he found the light of 
the full moon at its mean distance to be about aoirooo of that of the 
sun. The employment of a candle is open to criticism, because its light 
is of a hue much warmer than that of the sun and still more so than 
that of the moon — a circumstance which must have introduced peculiar 
difficulties in making the i)hotometric matchings of shades. Bonguer 
would have much improved his method had he subjected the caudle- 
light to the sifting action of a suitable l)lue glass, so as to brings its 
color nearer to that of the lunar rays. 

However that may be, it is remarkable that that old determination 
agrees closely with the photographic measures which I obtained in 
taking series of solar and lunar images and comparing the times of 
exposure to which correspond photographs of the same intensity.' It 
is to be farther noticed that Bouguer's determination refers to the 
integral of visible rays, while the photographs are caused by more 
refrangible rays. 

One could only infer that the lunar rays are highly photographic and 
have great intensity in the blue and violet. The hue of moonlight 
might have enabled us to foresee that result. 

The comparison of the light of the sun and moon speaks volumes in 
regard to the admirable elasticity of our visual organ. When a country 
is lit up by the full moon it only receives gooVoo of the light of noon- 

' Instead of taking photographs of the luminaries themselves, we can also, as I 
did at the time, avail ourselves of bands of successive intensity obtained by sun. 
light and moonlight. Thus, for the moon, we exposed to its light a holder whose 
curtain uncovered successively and at etjual intervals of time the different parts of 
a sensitive plate, giving, after (levelopuicnt, a series of bauds of increasing opacity, 
■which were compared with a plate exposed to sunlight for ^i/utr second.

day. One might siip[)Ose that such a prodij^ious loweriiii;' of the illumi- 
nation Avould i)roduce apparently total darkness. Yet our organ takes 
on such increased sensibility nnder those circumstances that we can 
not only lind our way about, but distinguish objects, make out details, 
and even enjoy the landscape. Nay, in some tine tropical regions bright 
nights seem almost like day. 

Before quitting the subject of the moon let us say a word about tlie 
earth light. Everybody knows the appearance of "the new moon m 
the old moon's arms." It is a faint light on the darker side of the moon 
showing the main features, i. e., the great " seas" or dark patches, to the 
naked eye, and m a large telescoj^e showing almost everything that can 
be seen at full moon, though not so well as at other phases. 

The genius of Lionardo (less correctly Leonardo) da Vinci divined 
that the cause of this was the light reflected from the earth. Photo- 
grapliic photometry can give us the relative brightness of this light. 
In an experiment made with a telescoi)e of 0.50 meter a|)erture and 1.00 
meters focal length I obtained an image of the lunar ball, rendered 
visible by earth light in sixty seconds, showing the great accidents of 
its surface. On the other hand, from a series of photographs of the full 
moon it was found that one obtained by an exposure of one-eightieth 
of a second had the same intensity. We infer that the ratio of intensity 
of full earth light to sunlight at the moon's surfjice is 50-00- ^I'fiS*^ I'^^d 
found jo-oi, in one observation, i^oVo in a subsequent one. The value 
501)0 seeins probably nearer the truth. These determinations are to be 
regarded as merely preliminary to a thorough study in which the situa- 
tions of the three luminaries are to be taken account of and the specular 
distinguished from irregular reflection from the earth. 

Fixed stars in the focus of a telescope appear nearly like points, not 
lending themselves advantageously to photometric comparisons, least 
of all by the photographic method. Accordingly I have ])ropose(l, 
instead of putting tlie sensitive i)late in the focal plane of the instru- 
ment to place it a little forward of that plane. In this way, instead of 
a point each star nnikes a little disk bounded T)y the section of the 
cone of rays from the objective by tlie ]>linie of the fllni. With a well- 
corrected lens this disk will be uniformly illuminated. 1 term this disk 
the "stellar circle." With ftrst-magnitude stars and a telescope of mod- 
erate size a few secoiuls suffice for obtaining such a photograjjli as is 
most suitable. We can obtain on one and the same i^late a series of 
such circles of graduated exposures. 

Forming a similar series with a second comparison star, the differ- 
ences in the times ot*exi)OSure being constiint in each series, though 
not quite equal in the t-wo, it will only remain, after the development, to 
pick out two circles, one from each series of equal intensities, just as 
in reading a vernier we find two coincident lines. The photographic 
luminosities of the two stars will be inversely as the times of exposure. 

When the problem is to compare a star with the sun a special device 
is required on account of the euormous light of tlie letter. We cap 



PHOTOGRAPHIC PHOTOMETRY. 195 

then make use of the pliotographio photometer. Suppose we have a 
holder fittiug a sensitive i)hite, and over the l-ntter a metallic shutter 
pierced with holes of the size of the "stellar circles." Before this plate 
let a second plate move by virtue of a spring, this second plate having 
a triangular window. When the window, in consequence of the action 
of the spring, passes before the holes of the shutter it will determine 
for each of them a photographic action, which will be measured by the 
width of the triangular window at that point and by the velocity of 
the slide, which can be evaluated by a tuning fork. Thus a series of 
circles of graduated intensity will be obtained comparable with the 
"stellar circles." These circles are due to direct sunlight. But to ren- 
der the results more strictly comparable it will be proper to lay the tele 
scope objective down on the plate, so that the effects of absorption and 
reflection may be the same as when the stars were photographed. 

By this method, the results of which were duly reported to the 
Academy of Sciences,^ the radiating powers of several stars were inves- 
tigated. In particular it was used to compare the light of our sun 
with that of the brightest star in the heavens, the Dog Star, or Sirius. 
It showed that that colossal orb had an intrinsic radiation in the i)ho- 
tographic spectrum ten times that of the center of our planetary 
system. 

But it is especially when we wish to measure the luminosity of special 
parts of an object, and are not content with knowing the total radia 
tion, that the advantages of the photographic method are manifested. 
We have, for example, been able to evaluate the light of different j)arts 
of the tail of comet 1881 b, and to give quite closely the law of the 
decrease of that light as the distance from the nucleus increases. 

The arrangement employed was as follows: On tlie photograi)hic 
plate, fitted into a holder, was placed a screen with an opening represent- 
ing the comet's tail. Before the apparatus was a shutter in which a trian- 
gle had been cut out, having its base rectilinear, but its sides curved. 
When this triangular window moved in the direction of the line of its 
base the times of exposure of the different parts depended on the forms 
of the curved sides. The whole base moved along that point of the 
opening in the screen that represented the nucleus, while the vertex of 
the triangle passed over the i)art of the opening representing the 
extreme and evanescent portions of the tail. Here the time of exposure 
vanished. In intermediate parts, say, at distance x from the base, the 
time of exposure was proportional to the distance, 2;/, from one side of 
the triangle to the other along a line parallel to the base and to the motion. 
A number of such shutters were constructed, the curves of the sides 
being determined by one of the equations Ay = x"\ m having a constant 
value for each shutter, but different values for different shutters. The 
whole being exposed to uniform illumination and the shutter moved by 
a spring an artificial figure of a comet was obtained with each shutter —

196 PHOTOGRAPHIC PHOTOMETRY. 

that is, with each vahie of m. When m='2 the photographic action 
would be inversely as the second power of tlie distance from the nucleus. 
With m = 3, it would be inversely as the third power, etc. 

Now, the different pictures so obtained being compared with the 
photograph of the real comet, it was found that the intensities could 
best be matched in all parts by taking m between 4 and 0, so that the 
result was that the intensity of the light in the comet's tail, in the 
photographic part of the spectrum, varied inversely as the fourth to 
sixth power of the distance from the nucleus.^ At such enormous rate 
does the light diminish as we pass away from the nucleus. 

The method of "stellar circles" comes into play again when we wish 
to reproduce the conditions under which any celestial photograph has 
been taken, especially in the study of nebula?. A nebula is not an 
object having a definite outline, like the sun, the moon, etc. Its image 
is rather like a nimbus cloiul, its different parts differing greatly in 
brightness. The consequence is that differences in the power of the 
telescope, the time of exposure, the sensitiveness of the film, the trans- 
parency of the atmosphere, etc., result in i)ictures so different that they 
sometimes would not be supposed to possibly represent the same thing. 
If, for instance, a nebula has brilliant parts scattered in it, a photo- 
graph with short exposure will show these parts only as isolated from 
one another, while with a long exposure the intervening ])laces will be 
all filled up with little variation of intensity. In 1881 we obtained at 
Meudon a series of photographs of the great nebula in Orion, which 
show how surprisingly the aspect of that object may change with 
greater or less exposure. 

Nevertheless, if we wish to hand down to posterity monuments which 
shall allow changes in the nebula to be i)ut out of doubt, we must 
contrive some way in which the photographs of future ages shall be 
rendered comparable with those of today. Here the "stellar circles" 
afiord valuable assistance. Suppose that on the plate which has just 
received the photographic impression of the nebula we form stellar 
circles of some five stars, well chosen, not variable, and situated in the 
neighborhood. Then we shall obtain, after the development, along 
with the inuige of the nebula those of the stellar circles of comparison. 
The ratios of the times of exposure of the nebula and the circles will 
be carefully noted. Later, then, w^hen the time comes to make a com- 
l^arable photograph, we have only to ascertain the time of exposure 
which, with a new telescope and a new photographic pre]>aration, is 
required to produce stellar circles of the same diameter from the same 
stars of equal intensity, and we find by the rule of three the time of 
exj)osure requisite to obtain an equivalent photograph of the nebula. 

It is remarkable that we can, by such device, obtain, after any lapse 
of time, no matter how different all the conditions may have become, a 
photographic image altogether comparable with that of times gone by.

THE SPLASH OF A DROP AND ALLIED PHENOMENA.' 



By Prof. A. M. WoRTiiiNfrTON, M. A., F. R, S. 



The splash of a drop is a transaction which is accomplished in the 
twinkling' of an eye, and it may seem to some that a man who proposes 
to disconrse on the matter for an hour must have lost all sense of i)ro- 
portion. It' tliat oi)inion exists, I hope this evening to be able to 
remove it and to convince you that we have to deal with an exquisitely 
regulated phenomenon, and one which very happily illustrates some 
of the fundamental in'operties of fluids. It may be mentioned also 
that the recent researches of Lenard, in Germany, and J. J. Thomson, 
at Cambridge, on the curious development of electrical charges that 
accompanies certain kinds of sj)lashes have invested with a new 
interest any examination of the mechanics of the phenomenon. It is 
to the mechanical and not to the electrical side of the question that I 
shall call your attention this evening". 

The first well-directed and deliberate observations on the subject 
that I am acquainted with were made by a schoolboy at Rugby some 
twenty years ago, and were reported by him to the Rugby Natural 
History Society. He had observed that the marks of accidental 
splashes of ink drops that had fallen on some smoked glasses with 
which he was experimenting, presented an appearance not easy to 
account for. Drops of the same size falling from the same height had 
made always the same kind of mark, which when carefully examined 
with a lens showed that the smoke had been swept away in a system 
of minute concentric rings and fine stria'. Specimens of such j)at- 
terns, obtained by letting drops of mercury, alcohol, and water fall onto 
smoked glass, are thrown on the screen, and the main characteristics 
are easily recognized. Such a i)attern corresponds to the footprints of 
the dance that has been performed on the surface, and though the 
drop may be lying unbroken on the plate, it has evidently been taking 
violent exercise, and were our vision acute enough we might observe 
that it was still palpitating after its exertions. 

A careful examination of a large number of such footprints showed 
that any opinion that could be formed therefrom of the nature of the

motion of tlie drop must be largely conjectural, and it occurred to me 
about eiglitecn years ago to endeavor by means of the illumination of 
a suitably timed electric spark to watch a drop through its various 
changes on impact. 

The reason that with ordinary continuous light nothing can be satis- 
factorily seen of the splash is not that the phenomenon is of such short 
duration, but because the changes are so rapid that before the image of 
one stage has faded from the eye the image of a later and quite differ- 
ent stage is superposed upon it. Thus the resulting impression is a con- 
fused assemblage of all the stages, as in the photograph of a person 
who has not sat still while the camera was looking at him. The prob- 
lem to be solved experimentally was therefore this: To let a drop of 
definite size fall from a definite height in comparative darkness onto a 
surface, and to illuminate it by a flash of exceedingly short duration at 
any desired stage, so as to exclude all the stages previous and sub- 
sequent to the one thus picked out. The fiash nuist be bright enough 
for the image of what is seen to remain long enough on the eye for 
the observer to be able to attend to it, even to shift his attention from 
one part to another, and thus to make a dra\Ying of what is seen. If 
necessary the experiment must be cai)al)le of repetition, with an 
exactly similar drop Mling from exactly the same height, and illumi- 
nated at exactly the same stage. Then, when this stage has been 
sulhciently studied, we must be able to arrange with another similar 
drop to iliuminate it at a rather later stage, say one one-thousandth 
second later, and in this way to follow step by step the course of the 
whole phenomenon. 

The apparatus by which- this has been accomplished is on the table 
before you. Time will not suffice to explain how it grew out of earlier 
arrangements very different in appearance, but its action is very simple 
and easy to follow by reference to the diagram (fig. 1). 

A A' is a light wooden rod rather longer and thicker than an ordi- 
nary lead pencil, and pivoted on a horizontal axle, O. Tlie rod bears 
at the end A a small deep watch glass, or segment of a watch glass, 
whose surf\ice has been smoked, so that a drop even of water will lie 
on it without adhesion. The end A' carries a small strip of tinned iron, 
which can be pressed against and held down by an electro-magnet, C C. 
When the current of the electro-nuignet is cut off the iron is released, 
and the end A' of the rod is tossed up by the action of apiece of india 
rubber stretched catapult-wise across two pegs at E, and by this means 
the drop resting on the watch glass is left in mid-air free to fall from 

rest. 

B B' is a precisely similar rod worked in just the same way, but car- 
rying at B a small horizontal metal ring, on which an ivory timing 
sphere of the size of a child's marble can be supported. On cutting off 
the current of the electro-magnet the ends A' and B' of the two levers 
are simultaneously tossed up by the catapults, and thus drop and sphere

begiu to fall at the same inonieiit. Before, however, the drop reaches 
the surface ou which it is to iinpiiigfe, the timing sphere strikes a plate, 
D, attached to one end of a third lever pivoted at Q, and thus breaks 
the contact between a platinum wire bound to the underside of this 
lever and another wire crossing- the first at right angles. This action 
breaks an electric current which has traversed a second electro-magnet,

F (fig. 2), and releases the iron armature jST of the lever N P, pivoted 
at P, thus enabling a strong spiral spring, G, to lift a stout brass wire, 
L, out of mercury, and to break at the surface of the mercury a strong 
current that has circulated round the primary circuit of a IJuhmkorft's 
induction coil; this produces at the surface of the mercury a bright 
self-induction spark in the neighborhood of the splash, and it is by this

flash tliat tlie splasli is viewed. The illumi nation is greatly helped by 
surrounding- the i)lace where the splash and flash are produced by a 
white cardboard inclosure, seen in fig. 2, from whose walls the light is 
diflused. 

It will be observed that the time at which the spark is made will 
depend on the distance that the sphere has to fall before striking the 
plate D, for the subsequent action of demagnetizing F and pulling the 
wire L out of the mercury in the cup H is the same on each occasion. 
The modus operandi is consequently as follows: The observer, sitting 
in comparative but by no means complete darkness, faces the appa- 
ratus as it appears in fig. 2, presses down the ends A' B' of the levers 
first described, so that they are held by the electro-magnet O (fig. 1).

Then he ijresses the lever IST P down on the electro-magnet F, sets the 
timing sphere and drop in place, and then, by means of a bridge 
between two mercury cups, short-circuits and thus cuts off the current 
of the electro-magnet C This lets ofi' drop and sphere, and produces 
the flash. The stage of the phenomenon that is thus revealed having 
been sufficiently studied by repetition of the experiment as often as 
may be necessary, he lowers the plate D a fraction of an inch, and 
thus obtains a later stage. Not only is any desired stage of the phe-

nomeuon thus easily brought under examination, but the apparatus 
also affords the means of measuring the time interval between any two 
stages. All that is necessary is to know the distance that the timing 
sphere falls in the two cases. Elementary dynamics then give us the 
interval required. Thus, if the sphere falls 1 foot and we then lower D 
one-fourth of an inch, the interval between the corresponding stages 
will be about 0.0026 second. 

Having thus described the apparatus, which I hope shortly to show 
you in action, I pass to the information that has been obtained by it. 

This is contained in a long series of drawings, of which a selection will 
be i)resented on the screen. The first series that I have to show repre- 
sents the splash of a drop of mercury 0.15 inch in diameter that has 
fallen o inches onto a smooth glass plate. (Plates II, III.) It will be 
noticed that very soon after the first moment of impact minute rays are 
shot out in all directions on the surface. These are afterwards over- 
flowed or united, until, as in fig. 8, the outline is only slightly rippled. 
Then (fig. 9) main rays shoot out, from the ends of which in some cases 
minute droplets of liquid would split off", to be left lying in a circle on 
the ])late, and visible in all subsequent stages. By counting these drop- 
lets when they were thus left, the number of rays was ascertained to 
have been generally about twenty-four. This exquisite shell-like con- 
figuration shown in fig. 9, marks about the maximum spread of the 
li(i[uid, which, subsiding in the middle, afterwards flows into an annulus 
or rim with a very thin central film, so thin, in fact, as often to tear 
more or less irregularly. This annular rim then divides or segments 
(figs. 14, 15, 1(5) in such a manner as to join up the rays in pairs, and 
thus passes into the twelve-lobed annulus of fig. 16. Then the whole 
contracts, bat contracts most rapidly between the lobes, the liquid then 
being driven into and feeding the arms, which follow more slowly. In 
fig. 21 the end of this stage is reached, and now the arms continuing to 
come in, the liquid rises in the center; this is, in fact, the beginning of 
the rebound of the drop from the plate. In the case before us the drops 
at the ends of the arms now break oft" (fig. 25), while the central mass 
rises in a column which just fails itself to break up into drops, and falls 
back into the middle of the circle of satellites which, it will be under- 
stood, may in some cases again be surrounded by a second circle of the 
still smaller and more numerous droplets that split off the ends of the 
rays in fig. 9. The whole of the thirty stages described are accom- 
plished in about one-twentieth of a second, so that the average interval 
betw^een them is about one six-hundredth of a second. 

It should be mentioned that it is only in rare cases that the subordi- 
nate drops, seen in the last six figures, are found lying m a very com- 
plete circle after all is over, for there is generally soniQ slight disturbing- 
lateral velocity which causes many to mingle again with the central 
drop, or with each other. But even if only half or a quarter of the 
circle is left, it is easy to estimate how many drops and therefore how

many arms tlieie Lave been. It may be mentioned that sometimes tbe 
.surface of tlie central lake of liquid (figs. 14, 15, 10, 17) was seen to be 
covered with beautiful concentric ripples, not sbown in the figures. 

The question now naturally presents itself. Why should the drop 
behave in this manner? In seeking the answer it will be useful to ask 
ourselves another question. What should we have expected the drop 
to do? Well, to this I suppose most people would be inclined, arguing 
from analogy with a solid, to reply that it would be reasonable to expect 
the drop to flatten itself, and even very considerably flatten itself, and 
then, collecting itself together again, to rebound, perhaps as a column 
such as we have seen, but not to form this regular system of rays and 
arms and subordinate drops. 

Now this argument from analogy with a solid is rather misleading, 
for the forces that operate in the case of a solid sphere that flattens 
itself and rebounds, are due to the bodily elasticity which enables it 
not only to resist, but also to recover from any distortion of shape or 
shearing of its internal j^arts i)ast each other. But a liquid has no 
])ower of recovering from such internal shear, and the only force that 
checks the s[)read, and ultimately causes the recovery of shape is the 
surface tension, which arises from the fact that the surface layers are 
always in a state of extension and always endeavoring to contract. 
Thus Ave are at liberty when dealing with the motions of the drop to 
think of the interior liquid as not coherent, provided we furnish it with 
a suitable elastic skin. Where the surface skin is sharply curved out- 
ward, as it is at the sharp edge of the flattened disk, there the interior 
licjuid will be strongly pressed back. In fact the process of flattening 
and recoir is one in which energy of motion is first exi)ended in creat- 
ing fresh licjuid surface and subsequently recovered as the surface 
contracts. The transformation is, however, at all moments accom- 
panied by a great loss of energy as heat. INloreover, it must be remem- 
bered that the energy expended in creating the surface of the satellite 
drops is not restored if these remain permanently separate. Thus the 
surface tension explains the lecoil, and it is also closely connected with 
the formation of the subordinate lays and arms. To explain this it is 
only necessary to remind you that a liquid cylinder is an unstable con- 
figuration. As you know, any fine jet becomes beaded and breaks into 
drops, but it is not necessary that there should be any flow of liquid 
along the jet; if, for exanqfle, we could realize a rod of liquid of the 
shape and size of this ruler and liberate it in the air, it would not retain 
its cylindrical shape, hut Avould segment or divide itself up into a row 
of drops regularly disposed according to a definite and very sinq)le 
numerical law, viz, that the distances between the centers of contigu- 
ous drops would be equal to the circumference of the cylinder. This 
can be shown by calculation to be a consequence of the surface tension, 
and the calculation has been closely verified by experiment. If the 
liquid cylinder were liberated on a plate, it would still topple into a

regular row of drops, but they would be farther apart; this was shown 
by Plateau. Now imagine the cylinder bent into an annulus. It will 
still follow the same law/ i. e., it will topide into drops just as if it were 
straight. This I can show you by a direct experiment. I have here a 
small thick disk of iron, with an accurately planed face and a handle 
at the back. In the face is cut a circular groove, whose cross section 
is a semicircle. I now lay this disk face downward on the horizontal 
lace of the lantern condenser, and through one of two small holes 
bored through to the back of the disk I iill the groove with quick- 
silver. Now, suddenly lifting the disk from the plate I release an annu- 
lus of liquid, which splits into the circle of very equal droj^s which you 
see projected on the screen. You will notice that the main drops have 
between them still suuiller ones, which have come from the splitting up 
of the thin cylindrical necks of liquid which connected the larger drops 
at the last moment. 

Now, this tendency to segment or topple into drops, whether of a 
straight cylinder or of an annulus, is the key to the formation of the 
arms and satellites, and indeed to much that hai)pens in all the splashes 
that we shall examine. Thus in iig. V2 we have an annular rim, which 
in figs. 13 and 14 is seen to topple into lobes by which the rays are 
united in i)airs, and even the si)ecial rays that are seen in Iig. 9 owe 
their origin to the segmentation of the rim of the thin disk into which 
the liquid has spread. The proceeding is probably exactly analogous 
to what takes place in a sea wave that curls over in calm weather on 
a slightly sloping shore. Anyone may notice how, as it curls over, the 
wave presents a long smooth edge, from which at a given instant a 
a multitude of jets suddeidy shoot out, and at once the back of the 
wave, hitherto smooth, is seen to be furrowed or "•combed." There can 
be no doubt that the cylindrical edge topi^les into alternate convexities 
and concavities; at the former the liow is helped, at the latter hin- 
dered, and thus the jets begin, and special lines of flow are determined. 
In precisely the same way the previously smooth circular edge of fig. 8 
topples, and determines the rays and lines of flow of fig. 9. 

Before going on to other splashes I will now endeavor to reproduce 
a mercury splash of the kind I have described, in a manner that shall 
be visible to all. For this purpose I have reduplicated the apparatus 
which you have seen, and have it here so arranged that I can let the 
drop fall onto the horizontal condenser plate of the lantern, through 
wliich the light passes upward, to be afterwards thrown ui)on this 
screen. The illuminating flash will be made inside the lantern, where 
the arc light would ordinarily be placed. I have now set a drop of 
mercury in readiness and put the timing si)here in place, and now if 
you will look intently at the middle of the screen I will darken the 
room and let off the splash. [The experiment was repeated four or

five times, and the figures seen were like those of Series X.J Of course 
all tliat can be shown in this way is the outline, or rather a horizontal 
section of the splash 5 but you are able to recognize some of the con- 
figurations already described, and will be the more willing to believe 
that a momentary view is after all sufticieut to give much information 
if one is on the alert and has acquired skill by practice. 

The general features of the splash that we have examined are not 
merely characteristic of the liquid mercury, but belong to all splashes 
of a liquid falling onto a surface which it does not wet, provided the 
height of fall or size of the drop are not so great as to cause complete 
disruption,' in which case there is no recovery and rebound. Thus a 
droj) of milk falling onto a smoked glass will, if the height of fall and 
size of drop are properly adjusted, give forms very similar to those 
presented by a drop of mercury. The whole course of the phenomenon 
depends, in fact, mainly on four quantities only: (1) The size of the 
drop; (2) the height of fall; (3) the value of the surface tension; (4) 
the viscosity of the li(|uid. 

The next series of drawings illustrates the splash of a drop of water 
falling into water. 

In order the better to distinguish the liquid of the original drop 
from that into which it falls, the latter was colored with ink or with an 
aniline dye, and the drop itself was of water rendered turbid with 
finely divided matter in suspension. Finally, drops of milk were found 
to be very suitable for the puri>ose, the substitution of milk for water 
not producing any observable change in the phenomenon. 

In Series II the drop fell 3 inches, and was one-fifth of an inch in 
diameter. (Plate IV.) 

[In most of the figures of this and of succeeding series the central 
white patch rei)resents the original droj), and the white parts round it 
represent those raised i)ortions of the liquid which catch the light. 
The numbers at the side of each figure give the time interval in sec- 
onds from the occurrence of the first figure, or of the figure marked 
T = 0.] 

It will be observed that the drop flattens itself out somewhat, and 
descends at the bottom of a hollow with a raised beaded edge (fig. 2). 
This edge would be smooth and circular but for the instability which 
causes it to topple into drops. As the droj) descends the hollow 
becomes wider and deeper, and finally closes over the drop (fig. 3), 
which, however, soon again emerges as the hollow flattens out, appear- 
ing first near, but still below the surface (fig. 4), in a flattened, lobed 
form, afterward rising as a column somewhat mixed with adherent 
water, in which traces of the lobes are at first very visible.

The rising column, which is nearly cylindrical, breaks up into drops 
before or during' its subse(iU(Mit descent into the licjuid. As it disap- 
l)ears below the surface the outward and downwaid How causes a hollow 
to be again fortiied, up the sides of which an annulus of milk is carried, 
while the remainder descends to be torn again a second time into a 
vortex ring, which, however, is liable to disturbance from tlie falling 
in of the drops which once formed the upper part of the rebounding 
column. 

It is not diflicult to recognize some features of this splash without any 
ai)pii.ratus beyond a cui) of tea and a. simonfulof milk. Any drinker of 
afternoon tea, after the tea is i)ourc(l out and before the milk is put in, 
may let the milk fall into it drop by drop from 1 or 2 inches above it. 
The rebounding column will be seen to consist almost entirely of milk, 
and to break uj) into drops in the manner described, while the vortex 
ring, whose core is of milk, may be seen to shoot down into the liquid. 
But this is better observed by droi)ping ink into a tumbler of clear 
water. 

Let us now increase the height of fall to 17 inches. Series III 
exhibits the result (Plate V). All the characteristics of the last splash 
are more strongly marked. In hg. 1 we have caught sight of the little 
raised rim of the hollow before it has beaded, but in fig. 2 special 
channels of easiest flow have been already determined. The number 
of ribs and rays in this basket-shaped hollow seemed to vary a good 
deal with difllerent drops, as also did the number of arms and lobes 
seen in later figures, in a somewhat puzzling manner, and I have made 
no attempt to select drawings which are in agreement in this respect. 
It will be understood that these rays contain little or none of the 
liquid of the drop which remains collected together in the middle. 
Drops from these rays or from the larger arms and lobes of subsequent 
figures are often thrown off high into the air. In figs. 3 and 4 the drop 
is clean gone below the surface of the hollow, which is now deeper and 
larger than before. The beautiful beaded annular edge then subsides, 
and in fig. 5 we see the drop again, and in fig. (i it begins to emerge. 
But although the drop has fallen from a, greater height than in the 
previous splash, the energy of the impact, instead of being expeiuled 
in raising the same amount of licpiid to a greater height, is now spent 
in liffing a nmch thicker adherent column to about the same height 
as in the last splash. There v/as sometimes noticed, as is seen in fig. 9, 
a tendency in the water to How up past the milk, which, still compara- 
tively unmixed with water, rides triumphant on the top of the emer- 
gent column. The greater relative thickness of this column prevents 
its splitting into drops, and figs. 10 and 11 show it descending beIo\y 
the surface to form the hollovy of fig. 12, up the sides of which an annu- 
lar film of milk is carried (figs. 12 and ].">), having been detatehed from 
the central mass, which descends to be torn again, this time centrally 
into a well-marked vortex ring. 



206 THE SPLASH OF A DROP AND ALLIED PHENOMENA. 

If we keep to tlie same size of drop and increase the fall to some- 
thing over a yard no great change occnrs in the natnre of the splash 
but the emergent column is rather higher and tliinner and shows a ten- 
dency to split into drops. 

When, however, we double the volume of the drop and raise the 
height of fall to 52 inches, the splash of Series IV is obtained (Plate VI), 
which is beginning to assume quite a different character. The raised 
rim of the previous series is now developed into a hollow shell of con- 
siderable height, which tends to close over the drop. This shell or 
dome is a characteristic feature of all splashes made by large drops 
falling from a considerable height, and is extremely beautiful. In the 
splash atpresentunder consideration itdoesnotalways succeed in closing 
l)ermanently, but opens out as it subsides, and is followed by the emer- 
gence of the drop (tig. 8). In fig. 9 the return wave overwhelms the drop 
for an instant, but it ia again seen at the summit of the column in fig. 10. 

But on other occasions the shell or dome of figs. 4 and 5 closes per- 
manently over the imprisoned air, the liquid then flowing down the sides, 
which become thinner and thinner, till at length we are left with a large 
bubble floating on the water (see Series V, Plate VI I). It will be 
observed that the flow of liquid down the sides is chiefly along definite 
channels, which are probably determined by the arras thrown up at 
an earlier stage. The bubble is generally creased by the weight of 
the liquid along these channels. It must be remembered that the base 
of the bubble is in a state of oscillation, and that the whole is liable to 
burst at any moment, when such figures as (J and 7 of the previous series 
will be seen. 

Such is the history of the building of the bubbles which big rain- 
drops leave on the smooth water of a lake, or pond, or i)uddle. It is 
only the bigger drops that can do it, and reference to the number at 
the side of fig. 5 of Series IV (Plate VI) shows that the dome is raised 
in about two-hundredths of a second. Should tlie domes fail to close, or 
should they open again, we have the emergent columns which any 
attentive observer will readily recognize, and which have never been 
better described than by Mr. II. L. Stevenson, Avho, in his delightful 
Inland Voyage, speaks of the surface of the Belgian canals along which 
he was canoeing, as thrown up by the rain into "an infinity of little 
crystal fountains." 

Very beautiful forms of the same type indeed, but different in detail, 
are those produced by a drop of water falling into the lighter and 
more mobile licjuid, petroleum. 

It will now be interesting to turn to the splash that is produced 
when a solid sphere, such as a child's marble, falls into water. 

I found to my great surprise that the character of the splash, at any 
rate up to a height of fall of 4 or 5 feet, depends entirely on the state 
of the surface of the sphere. A polished sphere of marble about O.G of

dropped from a height of 2 feet into water, gave the figures of Series 
VI (Plate VIII), ill which it is seen that the water spreads over the 
sphere so rapidly that it is sheathed with the liquid even before it has 
passed below the general level of the surface. The splash is insignifi- 
cantly small and of very short duration. If the drying and polishing 
he not so perfect, the configurations of Series YII (Plate VIII) are pro- 
duced; while if the sphere be roughened with sandpaper, or left wet, 
Series VlII (Plate VIII) is obtained, in which it will be perceived that, 
as was the case with a liquid drop, the water is driven away laterally, 
forming the ribbed basket- shaped hollow, which, however, is now 
prolonged to a great depth, the drop being followed by a cone of air, 
while the water seems to find great difficulty in wetting the surface 
completely. Part of this column of air was carried down at least 10 
inches, and then only detached when the sphere struck the bottom of 

the vessel. 

Figs. 6 and 7 show the crater falling in, but this did not always hap- 
pen, for the walls often closed over the hollow exactly as in figs. 4 and 
5 of Series IV. Meanwhile the long and nearly cylindrical portion 
below breaks up into bubbles which rise quickly to the surface. 

By increasing the fall to 5 feet we obtain the figures of Series IX 
(Plate IX). The tube of fig. 1 corresponds to the dome of Series IV 
and V, and is not only elevated to a surprising height, but is also in the 
act of cleaving (the outline being approximately that of the unduloid 
of M. Plateau). Figs. 2 and 3 show the bubble formed by the closing 
up of this tube, weighed down in the center as in figs. 5 and of Series 
V. Similar results were obtained with other liquids, such as petroleum 
and alcohol. 

It IS easy to show m a very striking manner the paramount influence 
of the condition of the solid surface. I have here a number of similar 
marbles. This set has been well polished by rubbing with wash leather. 
I drop them one by one through a space of about 1 foot into this deep, 
wide, cylindrical glass vessel, lighted up by a lamp placed behind it. 
You see each marble enters noiselessly and with hardly a visible trace 
of splash. Now I pick them out and drop them in again (or to save 
trouble, I drop in these other wet ones); everything is changed. You 
see how the air is carried to the very bottom of the vessel, and you 
hear the " ^;..*7rT;?o?" of the bubbles as they rise to the surface and burst. 
These dry but rough marbles behave in much the same way. 

Such are the main features of the natural history of splashes, as I 
made it out between thirteen and eighteen years ago. Before passing 
on to the photographs that I have since obtained, I desire to add a few 
words of comment. I have not till now alluded to any imperfections 
in the timing apparatus. But no apparatus of the kind can be abso- 
lutely perfect, and, as a matter of fact, when everything is adjusted so 
as to display a particular stage, it will happen that in a succession of 
pbservations tbere is a certain variation iix what is seen. Thus the 



208 THE SPLASH OF A DROP AND ALLIED PHENOMENA. j 

configuration viewed may be .said to oscillate sliglitly about the mean 
for Avhicli the apparatus is adjusted. Kow this is due both to small , 
imperfections in the timing- apparatus and to the fact thai the splashes ' 
themselves do actually vary within certain limits. The reasons are not j 
very far to seek. In the first place the rate of demagnetization of the I 
electro-magnets varies slightly, being partly dependent on the varying 
resistance of the contacts of crossed wires and partly on the tempera- 
ture of the magnet, which is affected by the length of time for which 
the current has been running. But a much more important reason is 
the variation of the slight adhesion of the drop to the smoked watch 
glass that has supported it, and consequently of the oscillations to 
which, as we shall see, the drop is subjected as it descends. Thus the 
drop will sometimes strike the surface in a flattened form, at others in 
an elongated form, and there will be a difference, not only in the time 
of impact, but in the nature of the ensuing splash; consequently some 
judgment is required in selecting a consecutive series of drawings. 
The only way is to make a considerable number of drawings of each 
stage and then to pick out a consecutive series. Now, whenever judg- 
ment has to be used there is room for error of judgment, and moreover 
it is impossible to put together the drawings so as to tell a consecutive 
story, without being guided by some theory, such as I have already 
sketched, as to the nature of the motion and the conditions that 
govern it. You will therefore be good enough to remember that this 
chronicle of the events of a tenth of a second is presented by a fallible 
human historian, whose account, like that of any other contemporary 
observer, will be none the worse for independent confirmation. That 
confirmation I am fortunately able in some measure to supply. When 
I endeavored eighteen years ago to photograph the splash of a drop 
of mercury, I was unable to obtain plates sufficiently sensitive to 
respond to the very short exposures that were required, and conse- 
quently abandoned the attempt. But in recent years plates of exqui- 
site sensitiveness have been produced, and such photographs as those 
taken by Mr. Boys' of a flying rifle bullet have shown that difficulties 
on the score of sensitiveness have been practically overcome. Within 
the last few weeks, with the valuable* assistance of my colleague at 
Devonport, Mr. B. 8. Cole, I have succeeded in obtaining i)hotographs 
of various splashes. Following Professor Boys's suggestion, we 
employed Thomas's cyclist plates, or occasionally the less sensitive 
"extra-rapid" plates of the same makers, and as a developer, eikono- 
gen solution of triple strength, in which the plates were kept for about 
forty minutes, the development being conducted in complete darkness. 
A few preliminary trials with the self-induction spark produced at 
the surface of mercury by the apparatus that you have seen at work 
showed that the illumination, though ample for direct vision, was not

sufficient for pliotograi)hy. When the current strength was increased, 
so as to make the ilkimiuation bright enough for the camera, then the 
spark became of too great duration, for it lasted for between four and 
five thousandths of a second, within which time there was very per- 
ceptible motion of the drop and consequent blurring. It was therefore 
necessary to modify the apparatus so as to employ a Leyden-jar spark 
whose duration was probably less than ten-millionths of a second. A 
very slight change in the apparatus rendered it suitable for the new 
conditions, but time does not permit me to describe the arrangements 
in detaih It is, however, less necessary to do so as the method is in 
all essentials the same as that described in this room two years ago by 
Lord Eayleigh in connection with the photography of a breaking soap- 
film.' I therefore pass at once to the photographs themselves. 

The first two series (Plates X, XI) may be described as shadow photo- 
graphs. They were obtained by allowing a drop of mercury to fall 
onto the naked photographic plate itself, the illuminating spark being 
produced vertically above it, and they give only a horizontal section of 
the drop in various stages. The first series corresponds to a mercury 
splash very similar to that first described, and the second to the splash 
of a larger drop such as was not described. In each series the tearing 
of the thin central film to which allusion was made is well illustrated. 
I think the first comment that anyone would make is that the photo- 
graphs, while they bear out the drawings in many details, show greater 
irregularity than the drawings would have led one to expect. On this 
point I shall presently have something to say. 

Comparing the first set of drawings with the photographs of Series 
X, it will be seen that photograph 2 corresponds to drawing 4 or 5; 
photograph 3 to that of 9; photograph 4 to that of 18; i)hotograph G 
to that of 20, and photograph 7 to that of 24, but the irregularity of 
the last photograi)h almost masks the resemblance. 

ISeries XII (Plate XII) gives an objective view of a mercury splash as 
taken by the camera. Only the first of this series shows any detail in the 
interior. The polished surface of the mercury is, in fact, very trouble- 
some to illuminate, and this splash proved the most difficult of all to 
l^hotograph. 

Series XIII (Plate XIII) shows the splash of a drop of milk falling 
onto a smoked-glass plate, on which it runs about without adhesion, 
just as mercury would. Here there is much more of detail. In fig. 4 
the central film is so thin in the middle that the black plate beneath it 
is seen through the liquid. In fig. 8 this film has been torn. 

Series XIV (Plates XIV, XV) exhibits the splash of a water drop 
falling into milk. The first four photographs show the oscillations of 
the droi) about a mean spherical figure as it apjiroaches the surface.

210 THE SPLASH OF A DROP AND ALLIED PHENOMENA. 

In tlie subsequent figures it will be noticed that the arms which are 
thrown up at first afterward segment into drops which tly ott" and sub- 
side (fig. 8), to be followed by a second series whicli again subside 
(fig. 11), to be again succeeded by a third set. In fact, so long as there 
is any downward momentum the drop and the air behind it are pene- 
trating the li(piid, and so long must there be an upward flow of dis- 
placed liquid. Much of this flow is seen to be directed into the arms 
along the channels determined by the segmentation of tlie annular 
rim. This reproduction of the lobes and arms time after time, on a 
varying scale, goes far to explain the puzzling variations in their 
number which I mentioned in connection with the drawings. I had 
not, indeed, suspected this, which is one of the few new points that the 
photographs have so far revealed. 

With respect to these photographs,' the credit of which I hope you 
will attribute, first, to the inventors of the sensitive jjlates, and, second, 
to the skill and experience of Mr. Cole, I desire to add that they are, as 
far as we know, the first really detailed objective views that have been 
obtained with anything approaching so short an exposure. 

Even Mr. Boys's wonderful photographs of flying bullets were after 
all but shadow photographs, and did not so strikingly illustrate the 
extreme sensitiveness of the plates, and I want you to distinguish 
between such and what (to borrow Mr. F. J. Smith's phrase) I call an 
"objective view." 

It remains only to speak of the greater irregularity in the arms and i 
rays as shown by the photographs. The point is a curious and inter- 
esting one. In the first place, I have to confess that in looking over 
my original drawings I find records of many irregular or unsymmet- 
rical figures, yet in compiling the history it has been inevitable that' 
these should be rejected, if only because identical irregularities never 
recur. Thus the mind of the observer is filled with an ideal splash — 
an "auto-splash" — whose perfection may never be actually realized. 

But in the second place, when the splash is nearly regular it is very 
difiicult to detect irregularity. This is easily proved by projecting on i 
the screen with instantaneous illumination such a photograph as that 
of Series X, fig. G. My experience is that most persons pronounce what : 
they have seen to be a regular and symmetrical star-shaped figure, and 
they are surprised when they come to examine it by detail in continuous 
light to find how far this is from the truth. Especially is this the case • 
if no irregularity is suspected beforehand. I believe that the observer, , 
usually finding himself unable to attend to more than a portion of the 
rays in the system, is liable instinctively to pick out for attention a part

idea than can be gathered from the engravings of the amount of detail actually

lampblack carried down by the drop from the smoked surface on which it rested,

of the circumference where they are regularly spaced and to fill up the 
rest in imagination, and that where a ray may be really absent he prefers 
to consider that it has been imperfectly viewed. 

This opinion is confirmed by the fact that in several cases 1 have been 
able to observe with the naked eye a splash that was also simultaneonsly 
photographed, and have made the memorandum "quite regular," though 
the photograph subse(iuently showed irregularity. It must, however, 
be observed that the absolute darkness and other conditions necessary

proved worthy of an hour's attention.

THE WASTE AND COKSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD.i 



By Harvey W. Wiley. 



One of the greatest of tbe practical problems presented for solution 
by agricultural chemistry is the conservation of plant food. With an 
abundance of plant food and a favoring climate, it is difficult to place a 
limit to the power of the earth for supporting life. We have read much 
in political economy of the limit of subsistence, and one bold philoso- 
pher has based a theory of the limitation of the number of human 
beings upon the earth on the insufficiency of the earth to support a 
greater number. Happily, however, the Malthusian philosophy was 
promulgated before the days of that great agricultural renaissance 
which has been brought about chietly through the efforts of experimen- 
tal agricultural chemistry. I am not so blinded by the a(;hievements 
of agricultural chemistry as to deny to many other branches of science 
an important and, in many cases, necessary influence in this develop- 
ment of agricultural science; but I think every candid man will admit 
that in this development chemistry has always taken the front rank 
and led the way. This is preeminently true of the investigations into 
the nature and extent of the plant food available on the surface of the 
earth. 

In this country, owing to the great stores of wealth which the past 
had accunuilated in the soil, it is only within recent years that the 
question of the supply of plant food has assumed any practical impor- 
tance. As long as there were virgin fields at the disposal of the agri- 
cultural rapist, the conservation and restoration of exhausted fields 
were of little consequence. The result has been that the wealth of 
hundreds or i)erhaps thousands of years slowly stored in the soil has 
been jooured forth in a century, not only for the enrichment of this 
country but for the benefit of all countries. Unfortunately, or fortu- 
nately, these stores are now practically explored and there is little left 
in this land of virgin fertility to tempt the farmer to new conquests. 
Not only have these stores of plant food been utilized but, much to the 
discredit of the American farmer, they have been wasted. The mark 
of good agriculture is to see fields yielding annually good returns and

iiKTeasiiiii'. or at least not lossoiiiiii:-, in fertility. This bcinu true, the 
liistory of Ameriean ajiriculture to within a few years must be the his- 
tory of bad fanning", for everywhere we have seen fertile lields losing 
their fertility and farms once ]>rodnetive abandoned. No ditVerenee 
how great the store may be, if it be continually drawn upon and never 
replenished the day will sometime come when it will be exhausted. 
This day has come to a larg'e portion of the agri<'ultural lands of tliis 
eountry. and to-day there is an awakening everywhere in regard to the 
best methods of checking the waste and of restoring what has been 
lost. 

I desire for a brief period, on this occasion, to call the attention of 
the chemists of this country to some of the methods by which plant 
food is removed from the tields and some of the direct and indirect ways 
in which it is and nuiy be returned. On a former occasion ' I have dis- 
cussed the extent to which plant food is removed from the soil directly 
in the crops and the dangers which arise to an agricnltural community 
which continnally exi>orts its agricultnral i)roducts. On that occasion 
1 pointed out the amount of potash, phosphoric acid, and nitrogen per 
acre annnally removed by the crops of the United States, and showed 
that the only safe agricultnral i)roducts to send out of a country were 
sugar, oil, and cotton. It is true that with native, unexhausted soils a 
country may acquire great wealth by agricultural exports, but tlu' his- 
tory of the world Shows that a country which ilepends fen- its wealth 
and its commerce on agricultural exportation is in the eml reduced to 
l)aupei'ism. ^V single exam])le nuiy serve to accentuate this rennirk; I 
refer to the island (>f Cyprus, which two thousand years ago was the 
granary of many cities bordering on the ]\Ieiliterranean Sea. Supply- 
ing hundreds t)f thousands of people with corn, it gradually became 
impoverished, and to-day its soils are perhaps the poorest of any known. 

The waste to which I desire to call your attention today is not that 
which nornmlly takes place in the production of a crop, but that which 
is incidental to the cultivation of the soil and to a certain extent 
unavoidable. My purpose is to develop, if it be possible, the relations 
of agricultural chemistry to this waste, with the purpose of pointing out 
a course by which it can be returned and in what way we may at least 
reduce to a mininnnn the unavoidable removal of valuable i)lant food. 
You have all, perhaps, surmised the character of this waste; 1 refer to 
the denudation of fields by water and to the removal of soluble plant 
food by the percolation of water through the soil. 

The losses due to the denudation of tields are i)urely of a mechanical 
character. The natural forest, or the natural covering of grass over an 
area of soil, prevents to a large extent the denudation due to heavy 
downpours of rain. The removal of the forest and the destruction of 
the grass by cultivation leave the soil in a condition in which it is

uiiiil)l(' to icsist the action of liowiiigf Rurfiice water. The muddy 
charactiT of the water in all stieams bordering- on cultivated hilly lields 
alter a heavy rain storm is a familiar instance of the tremendous 
t'licrj^ies which are <'xerted by a heavy downpour of rain in the carrying 
of the soil into the streams and its transportation toward the sea. 

It is not necessary to emphasize tiie fact that the a^i'icultural chemist 
is practically p(»\verless to ]»re\"ent the surface erosion due to heavy 
rains, but ai few pract ical lessons derived froju the a])])lica.t ion of chemical 
<lis(^overies to the soils show how, in a certain measure, ev<Mi surface 
erosion may he controlled, or at least reduced to a minimum by the 
ai)plication of tlu^ })rinciples <tf culture founded upon the facts disclosed 
by advanced science. 

The observiuii' a^yriculturist will have noticed that even in a, hilly 
country a soil in situ underlaid by limestone is less likely to be cut up 
by iiuilies than a soil similaily situated and deticient in carbonate of 
lime. Th(^ n^ison of this is plain. In a soil deticient in lime the clays 
when once brought into susi)ension by moving Avater assume a semi- 
colloid state and remain indetinitely in suspension. Clays, on the other 
hand, which are heavily imi)regiKited with lime salts are in a lloccu- 
lated state, and the larger aggregates thus produced settle <puckly. 
The result of this is that such a soil is less easily moved by water, and 
a liehl thus treated less exposed to washing by heavy rains. 

Oni- knowledge of tlocculation and its physical and chemical results 
is dm' largely to the investigations of Shulze, Schloesing, and llilgard, 
and the results of their researches have shown in a most emjihatic way 
the beneficial changes which takii place, especially in stiff clay soils, by 
the application of lime. 

It is thus an incontrovertible fact that the surface washing of culti- 
vated iields, especially if the}' be naturally deficient in lime, could be 
greatly diminished and has been greatly diminished by the free api)li- 
cation of this substance. 

The change in the physical condition of the soil, which is produced 
l)y tlie lime, is also another important factor worthy of consider-ation. 
A stilf clay soil is almost impervious to the i)enetration of surface 
water and thus the amount which is carried oflf is raised to a maximum. 
A well-limed soil, on the contrary, in which the ])articles are ])erfectly 
llocculated, is nuu;h more pervious and the amount of water which will 
be retained and delivered gradually to vegetable growth is much 
greater. Thus the beneficial effects of lime are manifested in both 
ways — in the better retention of the flocculated clays and in increas- 
ing the capacity of the soil for holding a given amount of water in its 
interstitial spaces. 

There are many other salts which also have the same properties as 
those of lime, but I have sjjoken of lime salts chiefly because they are 
cheaper and therefore more economically applied. Perhaps next to 
lime, common salt would be the most efficient in producing the results 
already described; but connnon salt being extremely soluble would

soon be leached out of a soil. On the other hand, lime, even when sup- 
plied as hydrate, in which case it is somewhat soluble, quickly becomes 
converted into a carbonate which is practically insoluble in water which 
does not contain an excess of carbon dioxide. 

I am aware of the fact that liming to prevent erosion by surface 
drainage has not been emphasized as an example of the benefit of the 
proper chemical treatment of soils, yet I feel sure that all who will give 
the subject a thoughtful consideration will agree with me in saying that 
this aspect of the subject is one of no small importance, especially 
when considered iji respect of hilly fields, and even of fields of more 
level surface. 

Without dwelling long upon this point, it is oidy necessary to call 
your attention to the immense quantities of soil material annually con- 
veyed to the sea by the causes of erosion already mentioned to show 
^^ hat an active and powerful foe the farmer has in this source of loss. 
Anyone who watches, even for a short time, the volume of water carried 
by the Mississippi into the Gulf of Mexico will have a most effective 
object lesson in regard to this source of loss. 

A more striking lesson may be seen iu the hill regions bordering 
both banks of the Ohio River. Hundreds of fields once covered with 
sturdy forests of oak, maple, and walnut, and afterward bearing large 
crops of maize, tobacco, and wheat, may now be seen furrowed with 
gullies, as with the wrinkles of age, and abandoned to brush and briers. 
The same is doubtless true of other liill regions, but I speak the more 
advisedly of those which have come under my personal observation. 

Great, however, as the mechanical loss of plant food is, it is by no 
means as dangerous as the loss of the soluble materials caused b}^ the 
percolation of the water through the soil. The study of the nature of 
the loss of these soluble materials, together with the estimation of 
their amount, forms the subject of lysimetry. Agricultuial chemists 
have used many devices for the purpose of determining the character 
and amount of the natural drainage of soils. Evidently the treatment 
of a specially prepared x>ortion of soil by any solvent, although giving 
interesting results, does not indicate the natural course of solution. 
The only way in which this can be determined is to be al)le to collect, 
measure, and study the char-acter of the draiuage from a given portion 
of the arable surface of the earth in situ and under normal conditions. 
Various methods of lysimetric investigation have been proposed and 
used, all of them possessing many points of value. 

An excellent system of such observation has been established, fin- 
instance, at the Agricultural Experiment Station of Indiana. It is not 
my purpose, however, to discuss the mechanical details of lysimetry, 
but only to call your attention to the main principles which underlie it. 
The movement of water near the earth's surface is a matter of especial 
interest to agriculturists. Whitney ^ has clearly pointed out that the

No. 4. 



THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD. 217 

little e»xcess or deficiency of water is of far more importance to the 
growing crop than tlie quantity of the excess or deficiency of its other 
foods. Soils richest in i^laut food will produce a small harvest if there 
be a great excess or deficiency of water, while soils which are poor in 
plant food will produce an abundant crop if the water be present in 
proper amounts and have jiroper and timely access to the rootlets of 
the plant. The study, therefore, of the water movement in the soil, 
wlietlier laterally, upward, or downward, is of the utmost practical 
importance. The methods of a study of this kind have been well estab- 
lished by King.' 

The plant food of the soil, it is well understood, only has access to 
the absorbent organs of the plant when presented in a proper soluble 
or semisoluble form in connection with water. From a chemical stand- 
point, in connection with the subject under discussion, the movement 
of water in the soil should be considered in connection, not alone Avith 
its power of dissolving plant foods, but with especial reference to its 
j)Ower of carrying them not only away from the reach of the roots of the 
l)lant, but even out of tbe field and into the streams and rivers and 
eventually into the sea. For our present purpose, therefore, we have 
only need to examine lysimetric observations for the i)uri)ose of deter- 
mining the kinds of plant food Avhich are most exposed to waste. It 
is not my purpose to take your time here with a vast array of figures, 
but I desire only to call your attention to the faet that of the chief 
plant foods potash and tlie nitrates are the ones which are most 
exposed to loss. 

The earliest systematic investigations of the quantity and composi- 
tion of drainage were commenced at the Eothamsted Station byLawes 
and Gilbert.^ in 1870. Lysimeters were constructed for the collection 
of the drainage water from 30, 40, and GO inches depth of soil, respect- 
ively, the soil and subsoil being kex)t in the natural state of aggregation. 

Lawes and Gilbert call attention to the fact that probably at the 
Eothamsted Station not more than 5 pounds of nitrogen are secured 
l)er acre each year from the atmosphere and the rain water, while the 
average loss of nitrogen tlirongh the drainage water is over 30 pounds 
per acre. The quantity of course varies with the amount of rainfiill 
and the activity of nitrification. They speak of the possible exaggera- 
tion of the loss of nitrogen on account of the fact that the air had 
access to the soil both from below and above, and therefore the process 
of nitrification where the lysimeters were placed might have been 
intensified. 

Among tlie latest researches on this subject are those of Deherain.^ 
It is pointed out by this author that the character of the crop grown 
ui)on the cultivated field has much to do with the determination of the

218 THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD. 

loss of iiitroi>cii ])er acre. Tliose crops which require an immense 
ainoniit of moisture for their growth, such as tlie sugar beet, would 
tend tliereby to i)revent the loss of nitrogen in the drainage waters, the 
nitrates being stored in the beet instead of being* given up to i^ercola- 
tion. In general, it may be said tliat it is the (juantity of the drainage 
water rather than its richness in nitrates wliicli determines the total 
loss due to ])ercolatiou, and from this it may be inferred that the loss 
by drainage is directly proportional to the rainfall and inversely pro- 
l^ortional to the magnitude of the harvest. The season at which the 
greatest loss takes j)la(*e is also, therefore, the one in which the growth 
of the ]»lant is tlu' least vigorous, ])rovided that the vigor of nitritica- 
tion and quantity of rainfall remain the same. When ]>lants grow 
vigorously and when tliey occui)y the soil for a long time, the losses 
due to drainagii are reduced to a mininuim. On the other hand, with 
plants wiiich rapidly ripen, so that the harvest follows soon after the 
sowing, the losses are greater. Tlie farmer, therefore, who suffers a fail- 
ure of his crop, not only loses from the smallness of the harvest, but 
also by the percolation of the water throiigh the soil. For this reason 
it is obvious that leaving fields fallow is a very dangerous proceeding. 
Deherain found that fallow fields during- tlie season lost as high as 50 
kilograms of nitrogen x>er hectare, corresponding to 330 kilograms of 
nitrate of soda, worth 70 francs. These figures show jilainly the mag- 
nitude of the losses which take place in the one item of nitrogen alone, 
due to the percolation of rain water through the soil. 

In this connection it may be of interest again to refer to the favorable 
action of lime in a great many soils in regard to its power of increas- 
ing the ability of a soil to hold the soluble plant foods against their 
removal by water. This favorable action is particularly manifested in 
many soils in the power of lime to increase their capacity for holding 
potash. 

Warington explains this action of the lime salts, especially the car- 
bonate, by suggesting that by combining with the acids of certain salts, 
as the carbonates, sulphates, chlorides, and nitrates, they allow the 
bases of these salts to unite with the hydrated metallic oxides. The 
carbonate of lime also converts the soluble acid phosphates, applied in 
manure, to the sparingly soluble calcium phosphates, which, as they 
gradually enter into solution, are converted into ferric and aluminic 
phosphates. An admirable description of the absorptive power of soils 
has been given by Warington,^ and many other authors have also dis- 
cussed this matter in detail. 

We can see from the data given above how" water continually acts 
upon a soil in the removal of certain soluble plant foods. It might be 
inferred from this that all arable soils exposed continually to rains 
would soon be exhausted of all valuable soluble plant food. But it has 
also been iiointed out how certain constituents of the soil have a faculty 



' Practice with Science, page 2. 



THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD. 219 

of absorbing and retaining materials which are sohible in water nnder 
ordinary conditions. It mnst not be forgotten also that tlierain water 
Avhich descends npon the earth is not pnre. Rain water brings to the 
earth a certain amount of valuable plant food. Ii^ot only does it absorb 
and hold in solution ammonia and nitric acid, which maybe formed by 
the electrical discharges in the air, but it also collects and brings to 
the surface of tlie earth vast quantities of meteoric dust containiug 
valuable fertilizing principles. Thus we have constantly entering the 
soil water which contains more or less of the materials necessary to 
plant growth. Even the drainage waters, which leave an arable field, 
may not reach the sea without giving up much of this material. The 
drainage waters in passing underneath the earth's snrface take devions 
conrses and are often l)ronght near to the surface again or are poured 
upon soils which are (piite diflerent in their texture from those fur- 
nishing the materials in solution. Sterry Hunt' has pointed out how 
such waters sooner or later come upon permeable strata by which they 
are absorbed and in their subterranean circulation undergo impor- 
tant changes. Especially when these waters reach argillaceous strata 
their content of neutral, soluble salts may snfl'er great changes. Snch 
waters, charged witli organic and mineral materials, contain, usually, 
large amounts of potassium salts and notable quantities of silica and 
phosjdiates and in nnmy cases ammoniated salts and nitrites or nitrates. 

The experiments of Way, Yoelcker, and others have shown that in 
contact with argillaceous sediments these waters give up their potash, 
ammonia, silica, phosphoric acid, and organic matter, which remain in 
combination with the soil; on the other hand, soda, magnesia, sulphuric 
acid, and chlorine are not removed from the drainage waters. Eichorn 
attribntes this power of selective absorption in the soil chiefly to the 
action of hydrated double aluminum silicates, and supposes that the 
process is one of double exchange, equivalents^ of lime or soda being 
given up for the potash retained. By this power of selective absor])tion 
the mineral matters required for the growth of plants tend to be retained 
in most soils, while those not required for the growth of plants are 
removed. Nevertheless, nuich of the valuable mineral material m solu- 
tion nuist escape absorption and finally find its way into the streams, 
rivers, and seas. 

From the foregoing summary of the methods of waste of i)lant food 
it has been seen that in spite of all the precautions of the farmer and 
the chemist, and in spite of the selective absorption of the soil, immense 
(piantities of valuable plant food are carried into the sea, where appar- 
ently they are lost to agriculture forever. But this is only an apparent 
loss. The economies of nature are so happily adjusted as to provide a 
means of gradually returning in some form or other to the power of the 
farmer the plant food which has been apjiarently destroyed. It is true 
that this return will probably not be to the locality where the waste

originally occurred, and it may not take place until after tlie lapse of 
thousands of years, but tliis is of no consequence. Provided arable 
lands in general leceive in some way and at some time a certain return 
for tbe plant food removed, it is entirely immaterial whether this be 
the original plant food removed or other equally as good. 

Tlie sea is the great sorting ground into which all this waste material 
is poured. The roller processes of nature, like the mills of the gods, 
grind exceedingly slow and small, and the sea becomes the bolting- 
cloth by which the products of milling are separated and sorted out. 
As soon as this waste material is ponred into the sea, the process of sort- 
ing at once begins. Tlie carbonate of lime becomes deposited in vast 
layers, or by organic life is transformed into immense coral formations 
or into shells. J'hosphoric acid is likewise sifted out into i)hosi)hatic 
deposits or ])asses into the organic life of the sea. Even the potash, 
soluble as it is, becomes collected into mineral aggregates or i)asses 
into animal or vegetable growth. All these valuable materials are thus 
conserved and put into a shape in which they may be returned sooner 
or later to the use of man. In the great cosmic economy there is no 
such thing as escape from usefulness of any valuable material. 

Sterry Hunt' has called esi)e('ial attention to this sifting and sorting 
power of water and the important i)art it plays in the formation of 
crystalline rocks. "Igneous fusion," he says, "destroys the mineral 
species of the crystalline and brings them back as nearly as j^ossible to 
the great primary and undifferentiated material. This is the great 
destroyer and disorganizer of mineral as well as of organic matter. Sub- 
terranean heat in our time, acting on buried aqueous sediments, destroys 
carbonates, sulphat* s, and chlorides with the evolution of acidic gases 
and the generation of basic silicates, and thus repeats in miniature the 
conditions of the anteneptunian chaos. On the other hand, each mass 
of cooling igneous rock in contact with water begins anew the form- 
ative process. The hydrated amorphous product palagonite is, if we 
may be allowed the expression, a sort of silicated i^rotoplasm, and by 
its differentiation yields to the solvent action of water the crystalline 
silicates which are the constituent elements of the crenitic rocks, leav- 
ing at the same time a more basic residuum abounding in magnesia 
and iron oxide and soluble not by crenitic but subaerial action." 

Let me call attention, for a few moments, to some of the more impor- 
tant ways, pointed out through the researches of agricultural chemists, 
in which these waste products are restored. We are inclined to look 
upon the sea as devoid of vegetable growth, but the gardens of the sea 
are no less fully stocked with economic plants than the gardens of the 
land. The seaweeds of all genera and species are constantly separat- 
ing valuable materials from the Avaters of the ocean and placing them 
again in organic form. Many years ago Forchhammer ^ pointed out the

agricultural value of certain fucoids. Many chemists liave contrib- 
uted iinportaut data in regard to the composition of these bodies. 
Jenkins^ gives analyses of several varieties of seaweed, showing that 
in the green state it is quite equal to stall manure. The farmers are 
said to pay as high as 5 cents a bushel for it. Goessmann^ also gives 
analyses of several varieties of seaweed. We are indebted, however, 
to the reports of Wheeler and HartwelP for the fullest and most sys 
tematic discussion of the agricultural value of seaweeds which has 
been published. Their interesting and elaborate report vas published 
in January, 1893. Those who are interested in the details of this work 
can find all known publications on the subject properly arranged, clas- 
sified, and studied in the publication mentioned. We learn from this 
publication that seaweed was used as a fertilizer as early as the fourth 
century, and its importance for this purpose has been recognized more 
and more in modern days, especially since chemical investigations 
have shown the great value of the food materials contained therein. 

To sliow the commercial importance of seaweed as a fertilizer it is 
only necessary to call attention to the fact that in 1885 its value for 
use in the State of Ehode Island was $05,044, while the value of all 
other commercial fertilizers was only .9104,133. While seaweed, in a 
sense, can only be successfully applied to littoral agriculture, yet the 
extent of agricultural lands bordering on the sea is so great as to ren- 
der the commercial importance of the matter of the highest degree of 
interest. 

It is not my intention here to enter into the discussion of the meth- 
ods of preparing the seaweed, the times at which it should be gath- 
ered, and the best means of applying it to the soil. These nuxtters are 
all thoroughly discussed by Wheeler and Hartwell in the publication 
mentioned. As an instance of the value of seaweed at a point far 
removed from the Ehode Island coast, I may be permitted to say that 
near the mouth of the Caloosahatchee Eiver, at the town of Fort Mey- 
ers, I saw the most hapjiy effects produced in intensive culture by the 
api)lication of seaweed alone to the sandy soils bordering on this arm 
of the sea. Dr. Washburn, of the Florida Experiment Statitm, was 
conducting the experiments to which I refer, and he spoke in the high- 
est terms of the value of the seaweed in his work. Thousands of tons 
of this seaweed are allowed to go to waste annually along these shores, 
simply because the agriculturist has not been informed in regard to its 
fertilizing value. 

There are many other uses for seaweed besides the agricultural one, 
but in these we are not much interested except incidentally. Many of 
the varieties of sea grass are used for filling mattresses, cushions, etc. 
Other varieties are burned and their ashes used for the manufacture

of soda, iodine, and bromine. The gelatinous portions of seaweeds 
become exceedingly hard and elastic upon being dried, and have been 
moulded into various forms as substitutes for horn and shells in making 
handles for knives, files, and other tools. In the Techno-Chemical 
Receipt Book, on page 177, may be found receipts for making artificial 
ebony from the charcoal obtained from seaweeds, also for making 
leather, soap, and glue. For the latter i)urpose the plants are dried 
and powdered, extracted with warm water, with or without the addition 
of alcohol. The solution is allowed to settle at a temperature of iL'O^ F. 
When cool it forms a jelly, which is used for various purposes. Tlie 
direction is then given for making trans[)arent seaweed leather, opaque 
seaweed leather, seaweed soap, and seaweed glue. * 

ISTo attempt can be made to give the quantities of seaweed which are 
annually cast upon the shores of the different continents. Perhaps 
Ehode Island is no more favored in this respect than any other locality, 
and we have seen the value of the seaweed which w-as gathered for 
agricultural purposes in that State alone. The amount gathered rep- 
resents only a very small fraction of the amount which was thrown 
upon the shores. It is easy therefore to conclude that the quantities 
of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and i)otash annually removed from the 
seas by the plants living therein are no less great in magnitude than 
those removed from the land by crops and plants of all kinds. 

But seaweed and other vegetable products of the sea are not the 
only vehicles in which the plant food in solution in the waters of the 
ocean may be returned to the uses of man. The animal life of the ocean 
is not less important than that of the land. In the aninuil economy of 
the ocean are gathered, therefore, immense quantities of valuable food 
material which are thus placed in a condition to be at least in part 
restored in the form of food. Relatively, i)hosplioric acid and nitrogen 
are restored in much greater quantities than potash. The composition 
of fish in general shows that relatively larger quantities of phosphoric 
acid and nitrogen are found than of fat and potash. The chemical 
composition of the nutritive portion of fishes has been thoroughly 
investigated by Atwater.^ 

The percentage of i)hosphoric acid in the flesh of American fishes in 
its fresh state is about one-half of 1 per cent. In one instance, that of 
smelt, Atwater found 0.81 per cent in the flesh of the fish. In the water- 
free substance of the flesh the percentage of phosphoric acid in round 
numbers is 2.5. In the case of the smelt, above mentioned, it amounted 
to 5.19 per cent. When it is considered that the bones and other refuse 
of the fish, presumably richer in phosphoric acid than the flesh, were 
Bot included in this investigation, tlie (luantity of phosphoric acid in 
fish is distinctly brought to view. 

"'The chemical composition and nutritive values of food fish and ac<iua.tic Ver- 
tebrates," by W. O. Atwater. Eeport of the United Stateti Commissiouer of Fish 
and Fisheries 1888, pages 679-868. 



THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD, 223 

The quantity of albumiuoids in the water-free substance of the flesh 
of fish is enormously high as compared with that of ordinary foods. In 
round numbers it may be said to be about 75 per cent of the total water- 
free substance. In some cases the albuminous matter, or in other words 
the protein, makes up almost the whole of the water-free substance, as 
in the case of a brook trout, quoted by Atwater, in which the percent- 
age of protein in the dry flesh was 93.25; and of a perch, in which it 
was 93.33; and of a sea bass, in which it was 95.88; and a red snapper, 
in which it was 95.38, and others in which even a higher percentage 
was reported. 

It is thus seen that the ordinary fishes of the ocean collect especially 
the two great elements of i)lant food, pliosphorus and nitrogen. 

Oysters and other shellfishes collect not only large quantities of 
phosphorus and nitrogen, but also larger quantities of carbonate of 
lime. As has been intimated in another place, it is entirely probable 
that in earlier times, when the sea was richer in phosphoric acid than 
at present, considerable quantities of phosphate of lime may have been 
secreted with the carbonate of lime in the. shell. At the present, time, 
however, the phosphate of lime has almost or quite disappeared from 
the matters of which shells are composed. 

While the art of fishing is j)racticed chiefly for the purpose of gaining 
human food, yet in many large fishing districts the fish waste becomes 
valuable fertilizing material. Some kinds of fish, as the menhaden, are, 
however, collected chiefly for their fertilizing value. The use of fish 
for fertilizing jnirposes is not new. A most interesting description of 
the use of agricultural fertilizers by the American Indians is given by 
Goode.^ As long ago as 1875 the value of the nitrogen derived from the 
menhaden was estimated to be about $l},000,()00. In the year 1878 it is 
estimated that 200,000 tons of menhaden were captured between Cape 
Ileury and the Bay of Fundy. The oil is first extracted from the fish for 
commercial purposes and afterward the residue is dried and ground and 
sold to farmers and fertilizer manufacturers. For a complete history 
of the menhaden the articles of Prof. G. Brown Goode in the Report of 
the United States Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries for 1877 and 1879 
may be consulted. 

The honor of teaching the American colonists the use of artificial 
fertilizers belongs, without doubt, to an Indian named Squanto. In 
Governor Bradford's History of Plimouth Plantation is given an 
account of the early agricultural experiences of the Plymouth colo- 
nists. In April, 1621, at the close of the first long, dreary winter, " they 
(as many as were able) began to plant their corne, in which service 
S(pianto (an Indian) stood them in great stead, showing them both ye 
manner how to set it, and after how to dress and tend it. Also he tould 
them, axcepte they got fish and set with it (in these old grounds) it 
would come to nothing; and he showed them yt in ye middle of Aprili,

224 THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD. 

they should have store enough come up ye biooke by which they begaue 
to build and taught them how to take it." ' 

Another account mentioned by Goode of the practice of the Indians 
in this i'esi)ect may be found in George Mourt's Ivelation or Journal 
of the Beginning and Proceedings of the English Plantation Settled at 
Plimouth in New England, by Certain English Adventurers, both Mer- 
chants and others, London, 1622. '"We set the last spring some twenty 
acres of Indian corn, and sowed some six acres of barley and i)ease, and, 
according to the manner of the Indians, Ave manured our ground with 
herrings, or rather shads, which we have in great abundance and take 
with great ease at our doors. Our corn did prove well, and God be 
praised, we had a good increase of Indian corn, and our barley indif- 
ferent good."- 

Thomas Morton, in his New England Canaan, London, 1(532, wrote 
of Virginia: "There is a fish (by some called shadds, by some, allizes,) 
that at the spring of the yeare passe up the rivers to spawn in the 
pond, and are taken in such multitudes in every river that hath a pond 
at the end that the inhabitants doung their ground with them. You 
may see in one township a hundred acres together, set with these fish, 
every acre taking 1,000 of them, and an acre thus dressed will produce 
and yield so much corn as three acres without fish; and (least any 
Virginea man would infere hereupon that the ground of New England 
was barren, because they use more fish in setting their corue, I desire 
them to be remembered, the cause is plaine in Virginea) they have it 
not to sett. But this i^ractice is onely for the Indian maize (which 
must be set by hands), not for English grain; and this is, therefore, a 
commodity there." 

The following amusing study quoted by Goode is taken from the 
records of the town of Ipswich, May 11, 1014: "It is ordered that all 
the doggs for the space of three weeks from the publishing hereof, 
shall have one legg tyed up, and if such a dog shall break loose and be 
found doing harm the owner of the dogg shall pay damage. If a man 
refuse to tye up his dogg's legg, and hee bee found scraping u^) fish in 
a cornfield, the owner thereof shall pay twelve i)ence damage beside 
whatever danuige the dogg doth. But if any fish their house lotts and 
receive damage by doggs, the owners of these house lotts shall bear the 
damage themselves." 

The ijractice of using fish, therefore, for fertilizing purposes is many 
centuries old, but until recent years the farmers residing along the 
coast were the only (mes who received any benefit therefrom; but since 
the more careful scientific study of the value of fish fertilization, the 
nitrogenous elements taken from the sea by the fish now find their way 
not only to the gardens and truck farms along the New England and 
New Jersey coasts but also to the wheat fields of Ohio and the cotton 
fields of North Carolina.

THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD. 225 



CONSERVATION OF NITROGEN. 

Attention has been called to the manner in which the nitrogen car- 
ried into the ocean by the waste of the land is retnrned in great part 
through the marine, vegetable, and animal "life. Immense quantities 
of waste nitrogen, however, are further secured, both from sea and 
laud, by the various genera of birds. The well-known habits of birds 
in congregating in rookeries during the nights, and at certain seasons 
of the year, tends to bring into a coinmou receptacle the nitrogenous 
matters which they have gathered and which are deposited in their 
excrement and in the decay of their bodies. The feathers of birds are 
particularly rich in nitrogen, and the nitrogenous content of the flesh 
of fowls is also high. The decay, therefore, of remains of birds, 
especially if it take i)lace largely excluded from the leaching of water, 
tends to accumulate vast deposits of nitrogenous matter. If the con- 
ditions in such deposits are favorable to the processes of nitrification 
the whole of the nitrogen, or at least the larger part of it, which has 
been collected in this debris, becomes finally converted into nitric acid 
and is found combined with appropriate bases as deposits of nitrates. 
The nitrates of the guano deposits and of the deposits in caves arise 
in this way. If these deposits are subject to moderate leaching the 
nitrate may become in filtered into the surrounding soil, making it very 
rich in this form of nitrogen. The beds and surrounding soils of caves 
are often found highly impregnated with nitrates. 

While for our purpose deposits of nitrates only are to be considered 
which are of sufticient value to bear transportation, yet much interest 
attaches to the formation of nitrates in the soil, even when they are 
not of commercial importance. 

In many soils of tropical regions not subject to heavy rainfalls the 
accumulation of these nitrates is very great. Miintz and Marcano^ 
have investigated many of these soils to which attention was called 
first by Humboldt and Boussingault. They state that these soils are 
incomi^arably more rich in nitrates than the most fertile soils of Europe. 
The samples which they examined were collected from different parts 
of Venezuela and from the valleys of the Orinoco as well as on the 
shore of the Sea of Antilles. The nitrated soils are very abundant in 
this region of South America, where they cover large surfaces. Their 
composition is variable, but in all of them carbonate and phosphate of 
lime are met with and organic nitrogenous material. The nitric acid is 
found always combined with lime. In some of the soils as high as 30 
per cent of nitrate of lime has been found. Mtrification of organic 
material takes phice very rapidly the year round in this tropical region. 
These nitrated soils are everywhere abundant around caves, as described 
by Humboldt, caves which serve as the refuge of birds and bats. The

iiitiogeiious matters which cduic from the decay of the remaius of these 
animals form true deposits of guauo, which are gradually spread arouud, 
and which, in contact with the limestone and with access of air, suffer 
complete uitrilication with the lixation of the nitric acid by the lime. 

Large quantities of thi^ guano are also due to the debris of insects, 
fragments of elytra, scales of the wings of butterflies, etc., which are 
brought together in those places by the millions of cubic meters. The 
nitrification Avhich takes place in these deposits has been found to 
extend its products to a distance of several kilometers through the soil. 
In some places the quantity of the nitrate of lime is so great in the soils 
that they are converted into a plastic paste by this deliquescent salt. 

It is suggested by the authors that the coexistence of the nitrate and 
phosphate of lime is sufhcient in all cases to demonstrate the organic 
origin of the nitric acid. It would not be possible to attribute such 
an origin to the nitrate present in these soils if it could not be deter- 
mined that it was thus associated with phosphate and other remaius, 
the last witnesses of a former animal life. 

As a result of the observations of Miintz and Marcauo, they conclude 
that it is not proper to accredit to the electrical discharges in the atmos- 
phere the origin of the nitric acid forming these de})osits, although they 
admit primarily the sourceof the nitric acid may have been due to elec- 
tricity, but that it first was passed through the organism of the plant 
and thence into that of the animal, whence it is accumulated in the 
deposits referred to. 

The theory of Miintz and Marcauo in regard to the nitrates of soils, 
esi)ecially in the neighborhood of caves, is probably a correct one, but 
there are many objections to accepting it to explain the great deposits 
of nitrate of soda which occur in many parts of Chile. Another point 
which must be considered also is this: That the processes of nitrifica- 
tion can not now be considered as going on with the same vigor as for- 
merly. Some moisture is necessary to nitrification, as the nitrifying 
ferment does not act in ])erfectly dry soil, and in many localities in 
Chile where the nitrates are found it is too dry to sui)posc that any 
active nitrification could now take place. 

The existence of these nitrate deposits has long been known.' The 
old Indian laws originally prohibited the collection of the salt, but nev- 
ertheless it was secretly collected and sold. Up to the year 1821 soda 
saltpeter Avas not known in Europe except as a laboratory product. 
About this time the naturalist Mariano de Eivero found on the Pacific 
Coast, in the province of Tarapaca, immense new deposits of the salt. 
Later the salt was found in equal abundance in the Territory of Anto- 
fagasta and farther to the south iu the desert of Atacama, which forms 
the Department of Taltal.

1852, Vol. 13, page 349 et seq. 



THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD. 227 

At the present time the collection and export of saltpeter from Chile 
IS a business of great importance. The largest export which has ever 
taken place in one year was in 1890, when the amount exported was 
927,290,430 kilograms; of this quantity 642,506,985 kilograms were sent 
to England and 86,124,870 kilograms to the United States. Since 
that time the imports of this salt into the United States have largely 
increased. 

According to Pissis ■ these deposits are of very ancient origin. This 
geologist is of the opinion that the nitrate deposits are the result of the 
decomposition of feklspathic rocks; the bases thus produced gradually 
becoming united with the nitric acid provided from the aii\ 

According to the theory of Nollner^' the deposits are of more modern 
origin and due to the decomposition of marine vegetation. Continuous 
solution of soils beneath the sea gives rise to the formation of great 
lakes of saturated water, in which occurs the development of much 
marine vegetation. On the evaporation of this water, due to geologic 
isolation, the decomposition of nitrogenous organic matter causes gen- 
eration of nitric acid, which, coming in contact with the calcareous 
rocks, attacks them, forming nitrate of calcium, which, in presence of 
sulphate of sodium, gives rise to a double decomposition into nitrate of 
soda and sulphate of calcium. 

The fact that iodine is found in greater or less quantity in Chile salt- 
peter is one of the chief supports of this hypothesis of marine origin 
inasmuch as iodine is always found in sea plants and not in terrestrial 
plants. Further than this, it must be taken into consideration that 
these deposits of nitrate of soda contain neither shells nor fossils nor 
do they contain any phosphate of lime. The theory, therefore, 'that 
they were due to animal origin is scarcely tenable. 

Lately extensive nitrate deposits have been discovered in the United 
States of Colombia.^ These deposits have been found extending over 
30 square miles, and vary in thickness from 1 to 10 feet. The visible 
supply is estimated at 7,372,800,000 tons, containing from 1 to 13 5 
per cent of nitrate. The deposits consist of a mixture of nitrate of 
soda, chloride of soda, sulphate of calcinm, sulphate of alumina and 
insoluble silica. It is thought that the amount of these deposits will 
almost equal those in Chile and Peru. 

PHOSPHATIC DEPOSITS. 

Gautier^ calls attention to the fact that the oldest phosphates are 
met with m the igneous rocks, such as basalt, trachyte, etc., and even 
m granite and gneiss. It is from these inorganic sources, therefore, 
that all phosphatic plant food must have been drawn. In the second

order in age Gautier places the pbosphates of hydro-mineral origin. 
This class not only embraces the crystalline apatites, but also those 
phosphates of later formation formed from hot mineral waters in the 
Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary deposits. 

These deposits are not directly suited to nourish plants. 

The third group of phosphates in order of age and assimilability 
embraces the true phosphorites containing, generally, some organic 
matter. They are all of organic origin. In caves where animal remains 
are deposited there is an accumulation of nitrates and phosi)hates. 

Not only do the bones of animals furnish phosphates, but they are 
also formed in considerable quantities by the decomj)Osition of substi- 
tuted glycerides, such as lecithin. 

The ammonia produced by the nitrification of the albuminoid bodies 
combines with the free phosphoric acid thus produced, forming aumio- 
nium or dianimouium phosphates. 

The presence of ammonium phosphates in guanos was first noticed 
by (Jhevreul more than half a century ago. 

If such deposits overlay a i)ervious stratum of calcium carbonate, 
such as chalk, and are subject to leaching, a double decomposition 
takes place as the lye percolates through the chalk. Acid calcium 
l)hosphate, and ammonium carbonate are produced. By further nitrifi- 
cation the latter becomes finally converted into calcium nitrate. In 
like manner aluminum i)hos[)hates are formed by the action of decom- 
posing organic matter on clay. 

Davidson ' explains the origin of the Florida phosphates by sug- 
gesting that they arose chiefly through the influx of animals driven 
southward by the Glacial i^eriod. According to his sux)position the 
waters of the ocean, during the Cenozoic period contained more phos- 
phorus than at the present time. The waters of the ocean over Florida 
were shallow, and the shellfish existing therein may have secreted 
phosphate as well as carbonate of lime. This supposition is sujjported 
by an analysis of a shell of TAngula oralis, quotcMl by Dana, in which 
there was .85.70 per cent of lime phosphate. In these waters were 
also many fishes of all kinds, and their debris served to increase the 
amount of this substance. As the land emerged from the sea, came 
the great Glacial epoch driving all terrestrial animals southward. 
There was therefore a great mammal horde in the swamps and estua- 
ries of Florida. The bones of these animals contributed largely to the 
phosphatic deposits. In addition to this, the shallow sea contained 
innumerable sharks, manatees, whales, and other inhabitants of trop- 
ical waters, and the remains of these animals added to the phosphatic 
store. 

While these changes were taking place in the Quaternary period, 
the Florida peninsula was gradually rising, and, as soon as it reached 

'Engineering and Mining Journal, quoted in the Phosphates of America, by 
Wyatt, page 66 et sei^. 



I 



THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD. 229 

a considerable height, the process of denudation by the action of water 
commenced. Then there was a subsidence, and the peninsuhi again 
passed under the sea and was covered with successive layers of sand. 
The limestones during this process had been leached by rain water, 
containing an excess of carbonic acid. In this way the limestones 
were gradually dissolved, while the insoluble phosphate of lime was 
left in suspension. During this time the bones of the animals before 
mentioned, by their decomposition, added to the phosphate of lime 
present in the underlying strata, while some were transformed into 
fossils of phos])hate of lime, just as they are found to-day in vast 
quantities. 

Wyatt ' explains the phosphate deposits somewhat differently. Ac- 
cording to him, during the Miocene submergence there was deposited 
upon the Upper Eocene limestones, more especially in the cracks and 
fissures resulting from their drying up, a soft, finely disintegrated cal- 
careous sediment or mud. The estuaries formed during this jieriod 
were swarming with animal and vegetable life, and from this organic 
life the phosphates were formed by decomposition and metamorphism 
due to the gases and acids with which the waters were charged. 

After the disappearance of the Miocene sea there were great disturb- 
ances of the strata. Then followed the Pliocene and Tertiary periods 
ajid Quaternary seas with their dej)osits and drifts of shells, sands, 
clays, marls, bowlders and other transported materials, supervening in 
an era when there were great fluctuations of cold and heat. 

By reason of these disturbances the masses of the phosphate deposits 
which had been infiltrated in the limestones became broken up and 
mingled with the other debris and were thus deposited in various 
mounds or depressions. The general result of the forces which have 
been briefly outlined was the formation of bowlders, phosphatic debris, 
etc. Wyatt therefore classifies the deposits as follows : 

(1) Original pockets or cavities in the limestone filled with hard and 
soft rock phosphates and debris. 

(2) Mounds or beaches, rolled up on the elevated points, and chiefly 
consisting of huge bowlders of phosphate rock. 

(3) Drift or disintegrated rock, covering immense areas, chiefly in 
Polk and Hillsboro counties, and underlying Peace Eiver and its tribu- 
taries. 

N, H. Darton, of the United States Geological Survey, ascribes the 
phosphate beds of Florida to the transformation of guano.^ According 
to this author two processes of decomposition have taken place ; one of 
these is the more or less comi)lete reijlacement of the carbonate by the 
phosphate of lime; the other is a general stalactitic coating of phos- 
phatic material. Darton further calls attention to the relation of the 
distribution of the phosphate deposits as affecting the theory of their

origiu, but does not fiud any peculiar significance in the restriction 
of these deposits to the western ridge of the Florida Peninsula. 

As this region evidently constituted a long, narrow peninsula during 
early Miocene times it is a reasonable tentative hypothesis that dur- 
ing this period guanos were deposited from which was derived the 
material for the phosphatization of the limestone either at the same 
time or soon after. 

Darton closes liis paper by saying that the phosphate deposits in 
Florida will require careful, detailed geologic exi)loration before their 
relations and history will be fully understood. 

According to Dr. N. A. Pratt the rock or bowlder phosphate had its 
immediate origin in animal life, and the phosphate bowlder is a true 
fossil. He supposes the existence of some species in former times in 
which the shell excreted was chiefly phosphate of lime. The fossil bowl- 
der therefore becomes the remains of a huge foraminifer whicli had 
identical composition in its skeleton with true bone deposits or of 
organic matter. 

Perhaps the most complete exposition of the theory of the recovery 
of waste phosi)hates, with esi)ecial reference to their deposition in 
Florida, has been given by Eldridge,^ of the United States Geological 
Survey. Eldridge calls attention to the universal presence of phos- 
phates in sea ^ater and to the probability that in earlier times, as during 
the Miocene and Eocene geologic periods, the waters of the ocean con- 
tained a great deal more phosphate in solution than at the x)resent time. 
He cites the observations of Bischof, whicli show the solubility of dif- 
ferent phosphates in waters saturated with carbon dioxide. According 
to these observations apatite is the most insoluble form of lime phos- 
phate, while artificial basic slag jihosphate is the most soluble. Among 
the very soluble phosphates, however, are the bones of animals, both 
fresh and old. Burnt bones, however, are more soluble than bones 
still containing organic matter. Not only are the organic phosphates 
extremely soluble in water saturated with carbon dioxide but also in 
water Avhich contains common salt or chloride of amMionium. The pres- 
ence of large quantities of common salt in sea water would, therefore, 
tend to increase its power of absorbing lime phosphates of organic 
origin. It is not at all incredible, therefore, to suppose that at some 
remote period the waters of the ocean, as indicated by these theories, 
were mucli more highly charged with phosphates than at the present 
time. 

According to Eldridge, the formation of the hard rock and soft 
phosjihates may be ascribed to three periods : First, that in which the 
primary rock was formed; second, that of secondary deposition in the 
cavities of the primary rock; third, that in which the deposits thus 
formed were broken up and the resulting fragments and comminuted 
material were redeposited as they now occur.

author's edition, 1892, page 18 et seq. 



THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD. 231 

"The first of these stages began probably not later than the close of 
the older Miocene, and within the Eocene area it may have begun much 
earlier. Whether the primary phosphate resulted from a superficial 
and heavy deposit of soluble guanos, covering the limestones, or from 
tlie concentration of phosphate of lime already widely and uniforndy 
distributed throughout the mass of the original rock, or from both, is 
a ditticult question. In any event, the evidence indicates the effect of 
the percolation of surface waters, highly charged with carbonic and 
eartli acids, and thus enabled to carry down into the mass of the lime- 
stone dissolved [)liosphate of lime, to be redeposited under conditions 
favorable to its separation. Such conditions might have been brought 
about by the simple interchange of bases between the phosphate and 
carbonate of lime thus brought together, or by the lowering of the 
solvent power of the waters through loss of carbonic acid. The latter 
would hapi)en whenever the acid was required for the solution of 
additional carbonate of lime, or when, through aeration, it should escape 
from the water. The zone of phosphate deposition was evidently one 
of double concentration, resulting from the removal of the soluble car- 
bonate thus raising the percentage of the less soluble phosphate, and 
from the acquirement of additional ]djosphate of lime from the over- 
lying portions of the deposit. 

"The thickness of the zone of phosphatization in the Eocene area is 
unknown, biit it is doubtful if it was over 20 feet. In the Miocene area 
the depth has been proved from the i)hosphates in situ to have been 
between G and 12 feet." 

The deposits of the secondary origin, according to Eldridge, are due 
chiefly to vsedimentation, although some of them may have been due to 
precipitation from water. This secondary deposition was kept up for a 
long ])eriod, until stopped by some climatic or geologic change. The 
deposits of phosphates thus formed in the Florida peninsula are 
remarkably free from iron and aluminum, in comparison with many 
of the i)hosphates of the West Indies. 

The third period in the genesis of the hard-rock deposits embraces 
the period of formation of the original deposits and their transporta- 
tion and storage as they are found at the present time. The geologic 
time at which this occurred is somewhat uncertain, but it was probably 
during the last submergence of the peninsula. 

In all cases the peculiar formation of the Florida limestone must be 
considered. This limestone is extremely porous and, therefore, easily 
penetrated by the waters of i)ercolation. A good illustration of this is 
seen on the southwestern and southern edges of Lake Okeechobee. In 
following down a drainage canal which had been cut into the southwest 
shore of the lake I saw the edge of the basin, which is composed of 
this porous material. The appearance of the limestone would indicate 
that large portions of it had already given way to the process of solu- 
tion. The remaining portions were extremely friable, easily crushed, 
and much of it could be removed by the ordinary dredging machines. 
Such a limestone as this is peculiarly suited to the accumulation of 
phosphatic materials, due to the percolation of the water containing 
tbem. Thf. solution of the limestone and consequent deposit of the 



232 THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD. 

phosphate of lime is easily uuderstood wiieu the character of this lime- 
stone is considered. 

Shaler, as quoted by Eldridge in the work already referred to, refers 
to this characteristic of the limestone and says that the best conditions 
for the accumnlatiou of valuable depos.its of lime phosphate in residual 
debris appear to occur where the i)hosphatic lime marls are of a rather 
soft character; the separate beds having no such solidity as will resist 
the percolation of water through innumerable incipient joints such as 
commonly pervade stratified materials, even when they are of a very 
soft nature. 

Eldridge is also of the opinion that the remains of birds are not 
sufficient to account for the whole of the phosphatic deposits in Florida. 
He ascribes them to the joint action of the remains of birds, of land 
and marine animals, and to the deposition of the phosphatic materials 
in the waters in the successive subsidences of the surface below the 
water line.' 

POTASH DEPOSITS. 

In the foregoing pages I have tried to set clearly before you the dif- 
ferent ways in which the waste of nitrogen and phosi)horic acid has 
been recovered by nature in a form suitable for restoration to arable 
fields. In the case of potash, however, we have seen that this element 
is not restored by the processes already mentioned, in amounts pro- 
j)ortionate to nitrogen and i)hos])horus. Potash salts, being extremely 
soluble, are likely to be held longest in solution. Some of them, of 
course, are recovered in the animal and vegetable life of which we have 
spoken, but the great mass of potash carried into the sea still remains 
unaccounted for. The recovery of the waste of potash is chiefly secured 
by tbe isolation of sea waters containing large quantities of this salt 
and their subsequent evaporation. Such isolation of sea waters takes 
place by means of geologic changes in the level of the land and sea. 
In the raising of an area above the sea level there is almost certain to 
be an inclosure, of greater or less extent, of the sea- water in the form 
of a lake. This inclosure may be complete or only partial, the inclosed 
water area being still in communication with the main body of the sea 
by means of small estuaries. If this body of water be exposed to rapid 
evaporation, as was doubtless the case in past geologic ages, there will 
be a continual influx of additional sea water through these estuaries to 
take the place of that evaporated. The waters may thus become more 
and more charged with saline constituents. Finally a point is reached 
in the evaporation when the less soluble of the saline constituents 
begin to be deposited. In this way the various formations of mineral 
matter, produced by the drying up of inclosed waters, take place.

Fuclis et DeLauuy, page 309 et seq. 



THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD. 233 

Tlie most exteusive deposits of potash known are those in the neigh- 
borhood of Stassfurt, in Germany, The following description i^robably 
represents the method of formation of these deposits:^ 

''The Stassfurt salt and potash deposits had their origin thousands 
of years ago, in a sea or ocean, the waters of which gradually receded, 
leaving near the coast, lakes which still retained communication with 
the great ocean by means of small channels. In that part of Europe 
the climate was still tropical, and the waters of these lakes rapidly 
evaporated, but were constantly re])leuished through these small clian- 
nels connecting them with the main body. Decade after decade this 
continued, until, by evaporation and crystallization, the various salts 
present in the sea water were de]30sited in solid form. The less soluble 
material, such as sulphate of lime or 'anhydrite,' solidilied first and 
formed the lowest stratum. Tlien came common rock salt with a slowly 
thickening layer which ultimatelj^ reached 3,000 feet, and is estimated 
to have been thirteen thousand years in formation. This rock-salt 
de])osit is interspersed with lamellar deposits of 'anhydrite,' which 
gradually diminish toward the toj) and are finally replaced by the 
mineral ' polyhalite,' which is composed of sulphate of lime, sulphate of 
potash, and sulphate of magnesia. The situation in which this polyha- 
lite predominates is called the 'polyhalite region' and after it comes the 
'kieserite region,' in which, between the rock-salt strata, kieserite (sul- 
phate of magnesia) is embedded, xVbove the kieserite lies the 'potash 
region,' consisting mainly of deposits of carnallite, a mineral comjwund 
of muriate of potash and chloride of magnesia. The carnallite deposit 
is from 50 to 130 feet thick and yields the most important of the crude 
l)<)tash salts and that from which are manufactured most of the concen- 
trated articles, including inuriate (»f potash. 

"Overlyiilg this region is a layer of impervious clay which acts as a 
water-tight roof to protect and preserve the very soluble ])otash and 
magnesia salts which, had it not been for the very protection of this 
overlying stratum, would have been long ages ago washed away and 
lost by the action of the water percolating from above. Above this 
clay roof is a stratum of varying thickness of anhydrite (sulphate of 
lime), and still above this a second salt dei)Osit, probably formed under 
more recent climatic and atmospheric influences or possibly by chemical 
changes in dissolving and subsequent precipitation. This salt deposit 
contains 98 per cent (often more) of pure salt, a degree of purity rarely 
elsewhere found. Finally, above this are strata of gypsum, tenacious 
clay, sand, and limestone, which crop out at the surface. 

"The perijendicular distance from the lowest to the upper surface of 
the Stassfurt salt deposits is about r),0(K) feet (a little less than a mile), 
while the horizontal extent of the bed is from the Harz Mountains to 
the Elbe Eiver in one direction, and from the city of Magdeburg to the 
town of Bernburg in the Other." 

According to Fuchs and De Launy'^ the saline formation near Stass- 
furt is situated at the bottom of a vast Triassic deposit surrounding 
the city of Magdeburg. The quantity of sea water which evaporated 
to produce saline deposits of more than 500 meters in thickness must 
have been enormous and the rate of evaporation great. It appears 
that a temperature of 100^ would have been quite necessary, acting 
for ai long time, to produce this result. 

iPotasli, Columbian Exposition, German Kali Works, pages 3, 4. 
2 Gltes Miu^raus, page 429, 



234 THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD. 

These authors therefore admit that all the theories so far advanced 
to explain the magnitude of these deposits are attended with certain 
difficulties. What, for instance, could have caused a temperature of 
100°? The most reasonable source of this high temperature must be 
sought for in the violent chemical action produced by the double 
decompositions of such vast quantities of salts of different kinds. 
There may also have been at the bottom of this basin some subter- 
ranean heat such as is found in certain localities where boric acid is 
deposited. 

Whatever be the explanation of the source of the heat it will be 
admitted that at the end of the Permian period there was thrown up 
to the northeast of the present saline deposits a ridge extending from 
Helgoland to Westphalia. This dam established throughout the whole 
of North Germany saline lagoons in which evaporation was at once 
established, and these lagoons were constantly fed from the sea. 

There was then deposited by evaporation first of all a layer of gyp- 
sum and afterwards rock salt, covering with a few exceptions the whole 
of the area of North Germany. 

But around Stassfurt there occurred at this time geologic displace- 
ments, the saline basin was permanently closed, and then by continued 
evaporation the more deliquescent salts, such as polyhalite, kieserite, 
and carnallite, were deposited. 

These theories account with sufficient ease for the deposition of the- 
saline masses, but do not explain why in those days the sea water was 
so rich in potash and why potash is not found in other localities where 
vast quantities of gypsum and common salt have been deposited. It 
may be that the rocks composing the shores of these lagoons were 
exceptionally rich in potash and that this salt was, tlierefore, in a cer- 
tain degree, a local contribution to the products of concentration. 

Through the ages of the past the rich stores of plant food have been 
steadily removed from arable fields and apparently forever lost. But 
in point of fact no particle of it has been destroyed. Even the denitri- 
fying ferments described by Springer, Gay on and Dupetit, and Miintz 
reduce only to a lower stage of oxidation or restore to a gaseous form 
the nitric nitrogen on which alone vegetables can feed. But electricity, 
combustion, and the activity of certain anaerobic ferments herding in 
the rootlets of legumes and other orders of plants are able to recover 
and again make available this loss. 

Lately Winogradsky and Warington have shown that an organism 
can be grown in a sugar solution containing certain salts and exclud- 
ing all nitrogenous matter save the free nitrogen of the atmosphere, 
which Is capable of oxidizing and assimilating this inert gas. In a 
solution containing 7 grams of sugar as high as 14 milligrams of nitrogen 
have been fixed. 



THE WASTE AND CONSERVATION OF PLANT FOOD. 



235 



Warington says in speaking of this phenomenon : 

"That a vegetable organism shonld be able to acquire from the air 

the whole of the nitrogen which it needs is S^f ^i^J^ ^f/f J/^m^^^^^^^^ 
and is an extraordinary fact both to the physiologist and the chemist. 

The fact that a few million years may supervene before the particle 
that is carried off to-day as waste may return to organic life shows 
the patience rather than the wastefulness of nature. 

As a result of this general review of the migrations of plant food, the 
reassuring conclusion is reached that there is no danger whatever of the 
nltimate consumption or waste of the materials on which plants live. 
Circumscribed localities, through carelessness or ignorance, where 
once luxuriant crops grew, may become sterile, but the great source ot 
supply is not exhausted. In fact, as the rocks decay and nitrifying 
oro-anisms increase, the total store of plant food at the disposal of vege- 
tation may continue to grow. When we join with this the fact that the 
skill of man in growing crops is rapidly increasing, we find no danger 
ahead in respect of the quantity of human food which may be produced. 

Only the novelist might be able, by the aid of an unfettered imagina- 
tion, to say how many human beings the United States alone will be 
able to feed in comfort. With the aid of scientific agriculture, with the 
help of the agricultural chemist, we may safely say that a thousand 
million people will not so crowd our means of subsistence as to make 
•Malthus more than a pleasing theorist. As I pointed out in my vice- 
presidential address at Buffalo, the death of humanity is not to come 
from starvation but from freezing, and many a geologic epoch will come 
and go before this planet dies of cold.

FOLTK DAYS' OBSERYATIONvS AT THE SUMMIT OF MOKT 

BLANC.i 



By M. J. Janssen. 



On Friday, the 22(1 of August, iu the year 181)0, about noon, a sleigh 
driven, or rather hoisted, by twelve men of extraordinary vigor and 
resolution, attained the summit of Mout Blanc. 

It was the first time an ascent had been accomplished in this novel 
style and that a traveler had reached the very top of the renowned 
pile hardly having set foot to the ground. 

The journey had called for heroic efforts. Slopes of extreme steep- 
ness had been climbed, broad crevasses had been crossed or turned, 
ridges like knife edges, with abysses on eitlier hand, had been followed. 
But triumph had crowned their efforts; and, the feat accomplished, 
there had been an ex])losion of enthusiasm — congratulations, and even 
kisses. 

The traveler, having paid his debt of praise and thanks to his com- 
panions, glanced at the scene unrolled before his eyes and seemed rav- 
ished with a sort of ecstacy. 

The weather was splendid, and the celestial vault appeared of a dark 
and somewhat violet blue; but quite unexpectedly, however rationally, 
that vault seemed contiuued below the horizon, as if the heaven had 
wished to draw its strings and inclose the observer in an azure sphere. 

The plains, the cities, the valleys, and all the fields which were spread 
out within the immense circle of that horizon looked as if they were 
sunk to the bottom of an ocean of heavenly blue. It Avas as if the 
kingdom of the mermen were revealed at the bottom of the ocean. 

However, from the bottom of that ocean rose here and there huge 
reefs, whose tops of dazzling whiteness emerged from the surface and 
rose towai d the horizon. These were the mountain chains at the center 
of which Mont Blanc presides. 

The traveler did not permit himself to be completely absorbed by that 
memorable picture. He directed his attention to the conditions ottered 
by this station for astronomical and physical observations, and after 
this scrutiny and rapidly taken notes were comj)leted he gave the sig- 
nal of retreat and the band descended.

238 OBSERVATIONS AT THE SUMMIT OF MONT BLANC. 

The success of tliis journey proved that those glaciers which present 
to the scientific man such novel and important subjects of research, 
and to the artist and the poet such sublime scenes, are henceforth not 
inaccessible to those whose j)hysical forces play the traitor to their 
wills. 

We may add that a mode of ascent which spares the traveler the 
extraordinary fatigues of an ascent on foot alone permits him fully to 
enjoy the beauty of those regions. 

A month later the traveler in question, he who has the honor of 
addressing you, reported to the Academy of Sciences the circumstances 
of the ascent and the observations he had made, calling attention to 
the advantages which meteorology, terrestrial i)hysics, and astronomy 
would find in this incomparable station, at which he proposed to estab- 
lish an observatory. 

Scarcely was his reading done when one of his colleagues, the 
Mecenas of contemporary French astronomy, enthusiastic for the proj 
ect, desired immediately to inscribe himself as principal cobperator. 
Shortly after, the project received the spontaneous cooperation of a 
prince friendly to science, the bearer of a great historic name, and <jiie 
of the most generous financiers of our age. 

To these supports were soon added others whose importance was due 
particularly to the high situations of the persons bringing their adhe- 
sion to the i^lan. 

A society was then formed. The President of the Republic conde- 
scended to be an honorary member; M. Leon Say, honorary president; 
M. Janssen, president; M. Bischoffsheim, secretary; M. Ed. Delessert, 
treasurer; MM. Prince Roland Bonaparte, Baron Alph. de Rothschild, 
Count Greffiithe, members. 

The scheme was thus incorporated and its realization now only 
depended upon the good fortune with which natural obstacles miglit 
be sui-mounted. Yet it could not be denied that the difdculties of the 
enterprise were great, as I had myself foreseen and emphatically stated. 

Indeed, the people who were the best acquainted with the glaciers of 
the great mountain deemed the establishment at the summit of a cou- 
structiou of some importance, capable of aftbrding lodging to tlie 
observers, to be impossible. On the one hand, it was said, and with 
great appearance of reason, the icy crust of the sunmiit must have a 
great thickness, forbidding the establishment of foundations on the 
rock, and on the other hand the possibility of founding on the snow 
was denied. In fact, the general opinion was unfavorable. 

On the other hand, M. J. Vallot had just established on the rock of 
the Bosses, about 400 meters from the summit, a refuge of great utility 
and an observatory which was to be considerably enlarged and would 
permit a variety of extremely valuable observations at a high altitude. 
But those considerations, notwithstanding their Aveightiness, could not 
arj^st us. 



OBSERVATIONS AT THE SUMMIT OF MONT BLANC. 239 

Tlie summit alone by its commanding situation and the immense liori- 
zou that it embraces is adapted to the investigations which we propose. 

An experience of thirty-live years of travel and research in the dif- 
ferent parts of the Avorld, especially my sojom-ns on the summit of the 
Faulhoru, on that of Etna, on the Pic du Midi, and on the highlands of 
the Himalaya had shown me the imperfections of observations made 
on the tiaiiks of mountains, by reason of all the disturbing causes 
which go to derange them, and the incontestible superiority from that 
point of view of the culminating points. 

I considered that, France having the good fortune to possess the 
better part of the great pile of Mont Blanc and to have access to its 
summit, we had not the right to stop so near our end, and in order to 
spare ourselves a last ettbrt to deprive ourselves of the incomparable 
advantages attached to the possession of the ])eak which commands 
three countries and i)ermits the study of a layer of air of 5 kilometers 
thickness and 100 diameter the conquest should be made at any cost. 
Hence, a& soon as the soundings, due in great i)art to the generosity of 
M. Eititel, had shown that the thickness of the snow at the top appeared 
to negative a foundation on the rock, I thought we ought not to hesi- 
tate to seek all means of obtaining an installation on the snow itself. 
But, as I said, this novel plan met with almost universal incredulity, 
and nothing but the conviction due to a thorough examination of the 
question prevented its author from being shaken by those criticisms. 

Two principal questions had first to be cleared up : In the first place, 
'What resistance could the snow of the summit offer to support the 
weight of an important construction? Kext, What movements were to 
be feared in the suowcap? 

In order to answer the first question experiments u^wn the resistance 
of snow were instituted at the observatory of Meudon. They gave sur- 
prising results for the force of the resistance. A column of lead of 3G0 
kilograms and only 30 centimeters diameter sunk only a few millimeters 
in settled snow brought to the density of that at the summit of Mont 
Blanc. Later the experiment was repeated with still more surprising- 
results. 

As to the question of movement, it was studied and solved by the 
putting in jdace, in the year 1891, of a little building of wood sunk in 
the snow by a determinate amount and carefully leveled. This little 
building has now beeu on the summit for two years and still answers 
for a storehouse. 

All these encouraging results having been acquired, the execution 
of the plan was vigorously begun. 

The shape of the observatory and its internal arrangement had to 
be adapted to the novel conditions of its erection. 

The construction, which was to have two stories and a terrace, took 
the form of a truncated quadrangular pyramid, a form which gives a 
large base aud otters little hold to winds on account of the slanting 
surfaces. 



240 OBSERVATIONS AT THE SUMMIT OF MONT BLANC. 

The lower story was to be three-quarters sunk under the snow in 
order to insure to the edifice a solid seat and to give the sleeping 
chambers of this story a relatively uiild temperature. 

.Moreover, the whole construction would be so bound together in all 
its x>arts that it would form a rigid whole, which with the aid of 
liroper jackscrews could be brought back into place in case motions of 
the snows of its foundations should take place. 

It was necessary also to take into acc<mnt the weight and dimensions 
of the materials by reason of the difficulties of transport over the 
glacier, it was decided to make the beams in different ]»arts hollowed 
out in the interior, so as to limit the weight of them and to obtain 
lightness combined with rigidity. 

Such were the general arrangements adopted. 

For their realization and the drawing up of plans I was greatly 
aided by my friend, M. Vaudremer, the eminent architect, member of 
the Academy of Fine Arts, who had fully ai)proved my ideas and my 
plan. 

The observatory was constructed at Meudon under our direction. It 
was then taken apart and transported to Chamonix, where the materials 
were divided for the ascent. The weight of the materials amounted to 
nearly 15 tons and formed the matter of seven or eight hundred por- 
ters' loads. Accordingly, to avoid confusion and diminish the chances 
of accident, the road was divided into four sections and huts of deposit 
and refuge were constructed at the two i^rincipal stations. 

The first section comprised the road from Chamonix to the entrance 
of the glacier. This road, new made in its upper part, could be traveled 
on the backs of mules. The second station embraced the part from 
the entrance of the glacier to the rocks called the Grands Mulcts, where 
there is an inn belonging to the comnume. 

At this important station in the midst of the glacier and at about 
3,()(U) meters elevation — that is, half way up — a rude hut for porters 
was built, for the transportation across this part of the glacier, which 
is highly diversified, can only be effected on men's backs. 

The course from the station of (Irauds Mulcts to that of the Cirand 
Kocher Eouge, about oOU meters below the summit, formed the third 
section. 

This station of the Grand liocher llouge was valuable owing to its 
proximity to the summit. We there built a living hut, which was of the 
greatest service to our workers. They came there to pass the night 
and to take refuge in bad weather. 

The whole summer of 1892 was spent in the construction of the obser- 
vatory, its transportation to Chamonix, the organization of the stations, 
and the building of the huts and transports. 

Business had been pushed, for at the end of the campaign all the sta- 
tions had been organized, a quarter of the materials had been carried 
to the Grand Eocher Eouge, and the rest was on deposit at the Grands 
Mulcts. 



OBSERVATIONS AT THE SUMMIT OF MONT BLANC. 241 

The campaign of 1893 was to be employed in linishing the transpor- 
tation of materials to the summit and to the building. 

An accident such as often happens on Mont Blanc came near com- 
promising the whole thing. A large deposit of materials placed at the 
Grand Eocher Eouge at the beginning of winter was nowhere to be 
found in the sprin-g. After hunting everywhere it was discovered 
buried beneath some 8 or meters of snow, and it was a great labor to 
get it out. 

To facilitate the transportation of the heavier pieces I had invented 
and caused to be consti^ucted a number of very light winches or wind- 
lasses, formed of a simi)le frame inclosing the drum and gearing and 
furnished with rings which allowed them to be solidly fixed in the 
snow by the aid of ice axes or stakes. 

These windlasses, placed from stretch to stretch on the great slopes, 
served to tug the sledges bearing materials. 

Thus the workmen were much relieved, and they could mount the 
greatest slopes, the ascent of which is so laborious and even danger- 
ous for heavily loaded porters. 

It was a novel thing, and curious, too, to see the great glacier of 
Mont Blanc, whose successive ^projections looked like the steps of some 
gigantic staircase, marked with the line of laborers working these 
machines, which slowly but surely dragged along the heavy loads 
toward the summit. It was a new kind of undertaking, whose object 
was not search for material wealth, but the conquest of a station which 
was to endow science with new truths. 

Meantime materials were accumulating ou the top, and the critical 
moment was api^roaching when the final eflbrt was to crown all these 
labors 5 I mean the moment of building. 

Then a gang of the strongest men was chosen — the most habituated 
to these high elevations. To them were joined the very carijenters 
who had put the house together at Meudon, and the summit was 
attacked. 

We were much afraid of the gales and the hurricanes that are so 
frequent on Mont Blanc; but by an unhoped-for piece of good luck, 
like a favor accorded to such iierseverance and such efforts, there was 
a whole fortnight perfectly calm with a temperature relatively mild. 

So the work went on with astonishing celerity, and on the 8th of 
September the observatory was built, walled in, floored, and its stair- 
case up. A part of the terrace alone remained in abeyance. It was 
necessary to go back to finish it. 

Meantime, impatient to see our observatory in i^lace and to make 
observations there, I organized my ascent. In this second journey to 
the top we employed windlasses for hoisting the travelers' sleigh. 
The line being attached to the sleigh, the guides carrying the windlass 
stretched out the rope and fixed the windlass at a good distance. The 
windlass, put m place on pickets and solidly bound to ice axes deeply

buried iii the snow, was set iii motion and the sleigh advanced. But, 
as it approached the machine, two guides took the Hue which had 
passed the drum, and, furnished with a second windhiss, went to 
establish a new hauling- station. As soon as the sleigh had reached 
the first windlass, the latter was disengaged and carried in its turn to 
a higher station, and this maneuver continued without interruption to 
the summit of the side to be climbed. 

Thus we climbed the steep slo])es of the Cerisier, of the Petit-Plateau, 
of the Grand Plateau, of the wall of the Corridor, avid of the wall of the 
Cote. 

The glacier this year, after the long and hot summer, was stripped 
of its snow and crevassed everywhere; so tliat it would in the opiniou 
of the guides have been impossible to accomplish the ascent by meu's 
arms alone, as was done in 1890. 

We left Chamonix Friday, the Sth of September, and we reached the 
summit Monday, the 11th, at haif past 2 in the afternoon. 

The ascent had been so difficult that we had to press into serv- 
ice, besides the men detailed to the sleigh, all the porters of provisions 
aud instruments. 

I had only taken with me the instruments requh-ed for the jirincipal 
observation that I had in view, and the provisions had been left at the 
Rocher Kouge where they were to be sent for the next day. 

IJut the weather suddenly became bad, and we remained Mithout 
provisions for the two days the gale lasted. 

Thursday at 1 o'clock the wind fell, the sky cleared up, and about 6 
I Avitnessed a magnificent sunset. The top of Mont Blanc emerged 
from a sea of clouds extending on all sides to the horizon. The rouuded 
forms of this surface looked like the waves of an ocean. Here and 
there fragments of cloud rising above the general level looked like 
isolated high mountains with strange voutlines. The rays of the set- 
ting sun lit up the scene with reddish tires and made of it a world too 
fantastic for Gustaxe Dore to dare to dream. However, little by little 
the cooling of the atmosphere produced a gradual descent of the 
cloudy layer, and the great peaks of the chain of Monte Rosa and of 
the Oberland began to emerge, sowing that sea with new archipelagoes 
whose glaciers glittered with redder and redder fires as the sun sank. 
The disk of this sun of blooil I'ed broke into sinister fragments whose 
tatters were soon lost in that sea. 

Tiien a glacial wind came u}) from the east aud breathed upon the 
surface of the deep, and the shadows descended. 

ISTothing can convey the impression such scenes x>roduce on those 
who love the sublime beauties of nature. 

Por my part, in face of this scene which recalled those pictures which 
show the first ages of the world when the continents first began to rise 
:ibo\ e the boundless surface of the waters, I was as one turning to 
stone. My emotions were too strong; to take notes would have been 



OBSERYATIONS AT THE SUMMIT OF MONT BLANC. 243 

impossible; but of that tliere was no need, since the succession of these 
scenes remained engraved ineffaceably upon my mind. 

Why are the emotions so lively? Why, in ijarticular, during the 
four nights I passed at the summit did I experience a feeling- of such 
delicious buoyancy throughout my being? Why did it seem that 1 
was relieved of a great weight which till then had fettered and weighed 
down my mind, and that it was now to take its flight and ox)eu in full 
liberty and love the questions the hardest and the finest of a higher 
moral order ? 

Is it the simple effect of the small specific gravity of the air of those 
high altitudes? Do there not enter other causes still unknown which 
shall be investigated in the future? 

Be this as it may, it seems that nature, which does nothing in vain, 
and which is full of these harmonies, wishes to prepare us by the very 
effect of these high altitudes to better feel the greatness and the sub- 
■ limity of the scenes that it presents to us.^ 

But the sun rose brightly the next morning, while I was present as 
spectator of an event less dramatic than the setting of the previous 
evening, but still of a grandeur unparalleled. I could give it, however, 
but a few moments' attention. I wished to profit by the presence of 
this fine sun to execute the long and delicate observations which I had 
not been able to make with my large instruments at the time of my 
ascent of 1890. 

Those observations related, as is known, to the vexed question of the 
presence of oxygen in the gaseous elements of the sun. 

The eminent American physicist, Draper, thought himself able to 
conclude from observations of spectral jjhotography that oxygen was a 
part of the solar atmosphere. Now this question of solar oxygen has 
an importance which transcends the purely scientific horizon. 

If the sun is so constituted as to fill for long ages its office of dis- 
penser of heat and light to the worlds it enchains around it, science 
foresees, nevertheless, that by the inevitable effect of time its radiating 
powers will diminish and more and more decline. Now if, during the 
ages which shall witness this lowering of temperature, the gaseous 
envelopes so rich in hydrogen surrounding the incandescent orb were 
to contain oxygen besides, a moment would necessarily be reached in 
which a combination of the two bodies would take j)lace, and then enor- 
mous quantities of aqueous vapor would appear in the solar atmosphere. 

Now, we know that the vapor of water is that one of the elastic 
fluids that is endowed with the most energetic power of absorption 
for radiant heat. This aqueous atmosphere would, then, form a veil, a 

' I here repeat what I have already said apropos of the ascent of 1890, that this 
state of mind supposes that one has nothing to do in the way of physical effort. In 
my opinion, it is the mode of going up I employed and the care I took to preserve 
all the forces of my intellectual life which put me into the state of mind shown in 
the above passages. 



244 OBSERVATIONS AT THE SUMMIT OF MONT BLA.NC. 

screen which woukl diminish in an enormous proportion the po\^ er ot 
the ah'eady decliuing suu. 

At the surface of the earth one would (piickly enough perceive the 
terrible phenomenon (supposing, at the low temperature the iiir would 
have, there were any living beings to i)erceive it, which is im]»robabIe). 
Temperature would everywhere fall, the climate of the iJoles would 
advance toward the equator (already far more frigid than the poles 
are now), and the conditions of vegetation and of animation would be 
still more remote from fulhllment. 

It is true that by reason of the enormous mass of our central orb 
and of the conditions which have i)resided over its constitution, we 
still have at all events a long future before us before we shall witness 
any such catastrophe. But let us not selfishly forget that the earth is 
not alone over against the suu, that the happy family of the planets 
counts sister planets whose mass is incomparably greater than ours, 
the evolution of the phenomena of animation there being correspond- 
ingly much slower, and that those planets need long futures to assure 
their healthy and normal development. Sucli is the case with Jupiter 
and Saturn, Avhose masses are so vast, and which appear to have passed 
through as yet but a small fraction of their evokition. 

We have thus an interest, not for the moment, but in the future, for 
our planetary world, in the atmosphere of the sun being so constituted 
as to have a long future before it; that is to say, in its being free from 
oxygen. 

But how shall we obtain intelligence as to the state of our interests 
in this matter ? 

If we could transport ourselves without inconvenience to the limit 
of our atmosphere, where it is on the border of the celestial void, the 
solution of the question would be simple enough. We should receive 
in a spectroscope a solar ray, and, by our knowledge of all the special 
and characteristic modifications which oxygen gas produces in the 
si^ectrum, should decide the question in an instant. 

But the problem is not so simple and easy. As things are, the 
atmospheric air consists one-fifth of oxygen, to which we mainly owe 
the presence of animal life on our globe, and when Ave wish to analyze 
a ray, it has already traversed an almost infinite thickness of oxygen. 
How, then, shall we distinguish between the spectroscopic effect on the 
sun's atmosphere and that of the earth ? 

Here it is that the high stations become useful. 

Imagine that, with our eyes fixed upon the solar spectrum, we could 
be buoyed up higher and higher in the air. We should see the oxygen 
lines pale as we approached the limits of our atmosphere ; and since 
these rays have not all the same intensity, but become weaker the less 
their refraugibility, we should see the feebler lines disappear one after 
another. If, then, it were made out that the decrement in the intensity 
and number of lines corresponded strictly to the quantity of oxygen

left below us, we should liave a riglit to infer tliat in rising still more 
and approacliing the atmospheric limits all the oxygen-rays of the 
si^ectrum wonld disappear, and that, consequently, the sun has nothing 
to do with the phenomenon, and contains no oxygen in its atmosphere. 

We come now to the observation made on Mont Blanc on Thursday, 
the 14th, and Friday, the loth, of September, 1S93. 

We have been able to aver that as a matter of fact the number and 
enfeebling of the oxygen lines of the solar spectrum seemed to cor- 
respond to an atmospheric thickness of 4,800 meters, precisely the 
amount which was underfoot, and that consequently the oxygen lines 
in the solar spectrum are entirely due to the oxygen of our atmosphere. 

To make sure of this is a delicate matter. On the one hand the 
heavens must be very pure, and on the other hand a large apparatus 
must be mounted with care and protected from the wind and from stray 
light. That is to say, the observation can only be properly made in a 
closed room sufficiently spacious Those are the conditions which the 
Mont Blanc Observatory ott'ertd. It was inaugurated by tliat study.' 

This absence of oxygen in the atmospheres of the central orb not 
merely interests us from the point of view of the future of the worlds 



' What makes tlie novelty of the ohservatious of 1893 is that ou the one hand 
they have been effected upon the summit of Mont Blanc, and especially that the 
instrument employed was infinitely superior to that of the two previous ascents. 
The first was a spectroscope by Duboscq, incapable of separating- the B group into 
distinct lines, while the second was a spectroscope with a Rowland grating (i)re- 
sented by Professor Rowland), with telescopes of 0.75 meters focal length, showing, 
it is needless to say, all known details of B. 

A sjiecial importance attaches to this, because there may be found in the constitu- 
tion of this B group valuable elements for measuring in some sort the effects of the 
decrement of the action of our atmosphere as we rise in it, and consequently for 
.judging whether that decrement corresponds to a total extinction at the limit of the 
atmosphere. In fact we know that the double lines, whose aggregate constitutes the 
B group, diminish in intensity as their refraugibility diminishes, or, if you choose, 
■with their increased wave length. 

We can avail ourselves of this circumstance, if not to measure, at least to esti- 
mate the diminution of the action of selective absorption of our atmosphere. In 
fact, we find that the feeblest doublets vanish .successively in the atmosphere — that is 
to say, according as the action of absorption diminishes. For example, in ordinary 
circumstances, on the surface of seas or plains, the maps of the B group show, 
besides what we call the head of B, thirteen or fourteen doublets. Already at 
Chamonix, at 1,050 meters, the thirteenth doublet is difficult to ruake sure of. At 
the Grauds Mulets (3,050 meters) it is only from the tenth to the twelfth that sure 
observations can be made. At the summit of Mont Blanc I could hardly go beyond 
the eighth. 

But is it not remarkable that, taking the ratio of atmospheric pressures on Mont 
Blanc and in the plain, or 

0.43 

-:^ = 0..566, 
0.76 

and multiplying this by tlie number of doublets generally quite visible in the plain, 
or say thirteen to fourteen, we get 7.4: or about the number {H) seen by me at the 
summit ? 



246 OBSERVATIONS AT THE SUMMIT OF MONT BLANC. 

that belong to it, but it has another bearing of a still more lofty 
order. It reveals to us a new harmony in the constitution of the 
system. 

We already know the grand outlines of the sun's constitution and 
the admirable conditions realized to assure both the abundance and 
the duration of the radiation with which it supplies the planets. We 
know how, as M. Faye's fine theory teaches, the incandescent surface 
of excessive thinness in which resides its radiating virtue is itself 
regenerated by the vast reserves of heat of the great central mass. 

We know too, that this radiating surface is protected from rubbing 
against the icy void of space by a number of gaseous envelojies. Of 
these envelopes, or atmospheres, the highest, and doubtless the most 
efficacious, is the coronal atmosphere, which, during total eclipses, pro- 
duces the splendid plienomenon of the glory of the corona. 

This atmosphere is principally composed of hydrogen, the lightest 
and most transparent of known gases. The capital function of radia- 
tion, which is the rational end of the central luminary, is then assured 
by that transparent and protecting atmosphere. But we now see that, 
by an arraugement no less admirable, the body which could in a moment 
compromise this function has been removed with care. 

Thus it is that science as she advances reveals to us at every step 
unknown laws and harmonies in the constitution of the world. 

The observatory which now rears its head above the summit of Mont 
Blanc has Just contributed a little part to this work. It promises in 
the future much larger results. The building is the realization of the 
thought and the desire of numbers of distinguished men of science 
who have worked on the renowned mountain. Since the memorable 
ascent of De Saussure, Mont Blanc has formed acquaintance with the 

But tLongh this is striking, it is the comparison with tubes placed under optical 
conditions as identical as j)ossible which alone can lead to any certain conclusion. 
These comparative experiments have been commenced in the laboratory of the 
Observatory of Meudou. They lead to the same result, to wit, the disappearance of 
the groups A, a, and B at the limits of the atmosphere. But because of the impor- 
tance of the question they will be tahen up anew and completed. 

It might be asked whether the elevated temperatures to which are submitted the 
gases and vapors of the solar atmospheres are not capable of modifying their power 
of selective absorption, and in particular whether oxygen, which might be in those 
atmospheres, would not have a spectrum quite different from that which we recog- 
nize in our experiments at ordinary temperatures. 

I have already instituted experiments with a A'iew to meeting this objection. I 
shall report them to the Academy, but I wish to say that the absorption spectra of 
oxygen, wJiether that with irresolvable bands or that with lines, do not appear to 
be appreciably modified when the oxygen is carried to 400'^ or 500'^. 

On the whole I may say that the observations which have lieen made at the sum- 
mit of Mont Blanc put the question of the telluric origin of the oxygen groups of 
the sol.ar spectrum upon a new footing much more precise and lead to the answer 
indicated.

various methods of investigation of Martins, Bravais, and Le Pileur, 
of Tyndall, Hodgkinson, Soret, Violle, and, more recently, M. A^allot. 

But it mnst be confessed that those researches wonld have given 
results still more important, in view of the science and talents of their 
authors, if the latter had had a better installation for their iustrnmeuts. 
Now that the observatory is built, and that it will soon ofiter a com- 
fortable sojourn, nothing will any longer prevent all the results that 
are to be expected at this station from being reached, 

A fine and copious scientific harvest is to be reajjcd. Let us invite 
to it the scientific men of all countries, and we shall thus adhere to the 
constant tradition of France, who has always loved to take the nations 
into iDartnership in her endeavors after progress and light. 



WEATHEE MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN.' 



By Mark W. Harrington. 



I 



The subject of ancient and modern weather making is a very large 
one — too hirge to be treated with entire generality. I shall discuss it 
rather from the American standi)oint, and shall use cases in the Old 
World simply for the purpose of illustration and for completeness. 

Three distinct sorts of weather making have been employed. The 
first depends on superstitious and religious methods; then follows on 
this the degradation of these religious ideas into folklore remnants, 
which have a curious persistency in civilized countries. Both these 
are psychic. Opx)osed to them is the third method, mainly American 
and intensely practical, with which some history and literature are 
connected. 

I. — Superstitious and Religious Methods. 

RAIN MAKING AND STOPPING.^ 

Many Indian tribes have attempted to produce rainy or dry weather, 
according to requirements. Among these may be mentioned the 
Mandan, the Muskingum, the Moqui, the Natchez, Zuili, Choctaws, 
and others. For this purpose pipes were smoked, tobacco was burned, 
prayers and incantations were offered, arrows were discharged toward 
the clouds, charms were used, and various other methods were emjiloyed. 
Classifying by tribes the processes employed, we turn first to the 
Iroquois. 

Mrs. E. A. Smith, in her Myths of the Iroquois, says : 

"In a dry season, the horizon being filled with distant thunder heads, 
it was customary to burn what is called by the Indians real tobacco as 
an offering to bring rain. 

" On occasions of this nature the people were notified by swift-footed 
heralds that the children, or sons, of Thunder were in the horizon, and 
that tobacco must be burned in order to get some rain."-^ 

'From tlie National Geograpliic Magazine, Vol. VI, pages 35-62, April 25, 1894. 
'These cases of weather making among the North American Indians were collected 
for me by Dr. Fuller AValker, of the Weather Bureau, who searched through the 
literature available in Washington.

^^50 WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 

As to tlie Muskingum, Heckewelder, in Lis Account of the Indians 
of Pennsylvania (Pbiladeli)liia, 1810, p. 229), says: 

"There are jugglers, generally old men ami women, who get tlieir 
living by pretending to bring down rain when wanted, and to im[)art 
good luck to bad hunters. In the summer of 1799 a most uncomuion 
drought happened in the Muskingum country (Ohio). An old man 
was applied to by the women to bring (U)wn rain, and, after various 
ceremonies, declared that they should have rain enough. The sky had 
been clear for nearly live weeks, and was equally clear when the Indian 
made this declaration; but about 4 o'clock in the afternoon the horizon 
became overcast, and, without any thunder or wind, it began to rain, 
and continued to do so until the ground became thoroughly soaked.'' 

Heckewelder adds that " experience had doubtless taught the jug- 
gler to observe that certain signs in the sky and in the water were the 
forerunners of rain." 

Among the Natchez, according to Father Charlevoix,' jugglers not 
only i)retended to cure the sick, but also professed to procure rain and 
seasons favorable for the fruits of the earth. Their incantations were 
often directed to the dispersion of clouds and the expulsion of evil 
spirits from the bodies of the afflicted. 

In the third report of the Bureau of Ethnology it is stated by J. Owen 
Dorsey that "when the first thunder is heard in the spring of the year 
the Elk i^eople (among the Omaha Indians) call to their servants, the 
Bear i)eopIe, who proceed to the sacred tent of the Elk gens. When 
the Bear people arrive one of them opens the sacred bag and, after 
removing the sacred pipe, hands it to one of the Elk men, with some 
of the tobacco from the elk bladder. Before tlie pipe is smoked it is 
held toward the sky, and the thunder god is addressed. - - - 'At 
the conclusion of this ceremony the rain always ceases, and the Bear 
people return to their homes.' "^ 

Catlin, in his "Life among the Indians" (p. 78), says that he found 
that the Mandan had "rain makers" and also "rain stoppers," who 
were respected medicine men "from the astonishing facts of their 
having made it rain in an extraordinary drought, and for having 
stopped it raining when the rain was continuing to an inconvenient 
length." He adds: 

"For this purpose, in a very dry time, the medicine men assembled 
in the medicine lodge, and sitting around a fire in the center, from day 
to day smoking and praying to the Great Sj^irit for rain, while a requi- 
site number of young men volunteered to make it rain. Each one of 
these, by ballot, takes his turn to mount to the top of the wigwam at 
sunrise in the morning, with his bow and arrows in his hand and shield 
on his arm, talking to the clouds and asking for rain, or ranting and 
threatening the clouds with his bow, conmianding it to rain. After 
several days of unsuccessful attempts have passed off in this way with 
a clear sky, someone more lucky than the rest happens to take his 
stand on a day on which a black cloud will be seen moving up. When

he sees the rain actually falling lie lets his arrow fly, and pointing says: 
'There! my friends, yon have seen my arrow go. There is a hole in 
that clond. We shall soon have rain enough.' When he comes down 
he is a medicine man. The doctors give him a feast and a great cere- 
mony and the doctor's rattle. When the doctors commence rain mak- 
ing they never fail to succeed, for they keep up the ceremony until the 
rain begins to fall. Those who have once succeeded in making it rain 
in the presence of the whole village never undertake it a second time. 
They would rather give other young men a chance." 

A similar account of the Mandan ceremony is given by Mr. John 
Frost in his book, "The Indians of Korth America" (New York, 1845, 
p. 109). He says: 

"It was in a time of great drought that I once arrived at the Mandan 
village on the Upper Missouri. The young and the old were crying out 
that they should have no green corn. After a dav' or Uvo the sky grew 
a little cloudy in the west, when the medicine men assembled together 
in great haste to make it rain. The tops of the wigwams were soon 
crowded. In the mystery lodge a fire was kindled, around which sat 
the rain makers, burning sweet-smelling herbs, smoking the medicine 
pipe, and calling on the Great Spirit to open the door of the skies to let 
out the rain. At last one of the rain makers came out of the mystery 
lodge and stood on the top of it with a spear in his hand, which he 
brandished about in a commanding and threatening manner, lifting it 
uj) as though he were about to hurl it at the heavens. He talked loud 
of the power of his medicine, holding up his medicine bag in one hand 
and his spear in the other; but it was of no use, and he came down in 
disgrace. For several days the same ceremony continued, until a rain 
maker with a headdress of the skins of birds ascended the top of the 
mystery lodge, with a bow in his hand and a quiver at his back. He 
made a long speech, for the sky was growing dark, and it required no 
great knowledge of the weather to foretell rain. He shot arrows to the 
sunrise and sundown points of the heavens and also to the north and 
south, in honor of the Great Spirit, who could send rain from all parts 
of the sky. A fifth arrow he retained until it was almost certain that 
rain was at hand. Then sending up the shaft from his bow with all his 
might to make a hole in the dark cloud ov^er his head, he cried aloud 
for the waters to pour down at his bidding and to drench him to the 
skin. He was brandishing his bow in one hand and his medicine in 
the other, when the rain came down in torrents." 

Among the Blackfeet Indians, according to W. P. Clark, in his 
"Indian Sign Language" (Philadelphia, 1885, p. 72)— 

"The medicine man has a separate lodge, which faces the east. He 
fasts and dances to the sun, blowing his whistle. He is painted in dif- 
ferent colors, and he must have no water, and only after dark can he 
eat, and then only the inner bark of the cottonwood tree. A picture 
of the sun is painted on his forehead, the moon, Ursa Major, etc., on his 
body. The dance continues for four days, and should this medicine 
man drink it is sure to cause rain, and if it [does not] rains no other 
evidence of his weakness is wanted or taken. He is deposed as high 
priest at once." 

Mr. W. Noble, of Indian Territory, says that "the Choctaws, during 
a severe drought, will fasten a fish to one of their number, who then 
goes into the water and remains there every day for two weeks in order 



252 WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 

to cause it to rain." He adds tliat ''in wet weather, if tbey wish the 
rain to cease, they go to a sand bank, \n\t sand in a pan, and dry it over 
a tire." 
Among the Moqui, according to Schoolcraft — 

"There is a charm used for calling down rain. It consists of a sinnll 
quantity of wild honey wrapped u]) in the inner fold of the husk of the 
maize. To produce the effect desired it is necessary to take a piece of 
the shuck which contained the wild honey, chew it, and spit it u]>on the 
ground which needs the rain."^ 

Capt. J. G. Bourke, in his "Snake dance of the Moqui" (p. 120), says: 

"There was painted on the east wall a symbolical design, or 'prayer,' 
representing three rows of clouds in red and blue, from which depended 
long, narrow, black and white stripes, typical of rain, while from right 
and left issued long red and blue snakes, emblematic of lightning. This 
was a prayer to the god of clouds to seiul refreshing rains upon the 
Moqui crops. - - - Yellow was used in all prayers for pumpkins, 
green for corn, and red for peaches." 

Among the ZuQi, according to Stevenson, medicine sticks were 
supposed to influence rain. These little sticks are found hidden 
beneath the rafters of nearly every house in ZuFii.^ 

Passing a little farther from home we find, in Acosta's ''History of 
the Indies,"^ some accounts of rain producing and weather making 
among the Peruvian natives. According to him a Peruvian king in his 
lifetime caused a figure to be made wherein he was represented, which 
they called Huaugue, which signifies brother. They carried this image 
to the wars and in ])rocessi()n tbr rain or fair vreather, making sundry 
feasts and sacrifices to it. They also pursued other luethods. "In 
matters of importance they offered up alpacas, hanging the beast by 
the right fore leg, turning his eyes to the sun, speaking certain words 
according to the quality of the sacrifice they slew, for if it were of 
color their words were addressed to the god of thunder and lightning, 
that they might want no water" (p. 341). If they wanted water, to 
procure rain they set a black sheep tied in the middle of a i)laiii, 
pouring much chica about it, and giving it nothing to eat until it rained 
(p. 370). This is practiced (says Acosta, 1571-1588) at this day in 
many places in the month of October. 

OTHER WEATHER MAKING. 

What precedes relates to rain making or stopping. A somewhat 
similar series of facts occur among the American Indians concerning 
other elements of the weather, but their energies in this direction seem 
to be ex])ended chiefly in the control of the winds. 

It appears that the Kansas gens of the Omaha are Wind jx'ople, and 
to them is especially intrusted the control of the wind. Mr. J. Owen

WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 253 

Dorsey says the Kauze (Kausa or Kaw) gens of the Omaha tribe, being 
Wind people, "flai^ their bhmkets to start a breeze."^ He adds that 
when there is a blizzard the other Kausa tribe of Indian Territory beg 
the members of the Wind gens to interpose, saying, "O grandfather, 
I wish good weather. Cause one of your children to be decorated." 
Then the youngest sou of a Kanze man, say one about 4 feet high, is 
chosen for the purpose, and i)ainted with red paint. The youth rolls 
over and over in the snow, reddening it for some distance all around 
him. This is supposed to stop the blizzard. 

The following account is from a book entitled The Fourteen loway 
Indians (London, 1844), and relates to raising wind: 

"A ])acket ship with Indians on board, was becalmed for several days 
near the English coast. It was decided to call upon the medicine man 
to try the efficacy of his nuigical powers with the endeavor to raise 
the Avind. After the usual ceremony of a mystery feast, and various 
invocations to the spirit of the wind and ocean, both weVe conciliated 
by the sacrifice of many plugs of tobacco thrown into the sea, and in a 
little time the wind began to blow, the sails Avere filled, and the vessel 
soon wafted into port." 

The Indians also have many associations with thunder. Madam 
Lucy Elliot Keeler, in a paper recently contributed to the American 
Agriculturist for December, 1892, says : 

"The Dakotas used to have a company of men who claimed the 
exclusive power and privilege of fighting the thunder. Whenever a 
storm which they wished to avert threatened, the thunder fighters 
would take their bows and arrows, their magic drum, and a sort of 
whistle made of the wing bone of a war eagle, aud, thus armed, run out 
and fire at the rising cloud, whooping, yelling, whistling, and beating 
their drum to frighten it down again. One afternoon a heavy black 
cloud came up, aud they repaired to the top of a hill, where they 
brought all their magic artillery into play against it; but the undaunted 
thunder darted out a bright flasli which struck one of the party dead 
as he was in the very act of shaking his long-pointed lance against it. 
After that they decided that no human power could quell the thunder." 

In the Pawnee Hero Stories and Folk-tales, jjublished by George 
Bird Grinnell, we find the following: 

"An old Pawnee Indian said : 'Up north where we worshipped at the 
time of the first thunder we never had cyclones. Down here [Indian 
Territory], now that this worship has been given u}), we have them.' " 

The Indians in some cases have ideas of controlling the weather more 
generally, and Dablin, in his Eelation of the Voyages, Discoveries, and 
Death of Father James Marquette,^ writing in 1671-1075, says: 

"It now only remains for me to speak of the calumet, than which 
there is nothing among the Indians [i. e., the Illinois] more mysterious 
or more esteemed. - - - They esteem it particularly because they 
regard it as the calumet of the sun, and in fact they i)resent it to him 
to smoke when they wish to obtain calm, or rain, or fair weather."

254 WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 

Even the coutrol of fog lias been attempted, as shown by the follow- 
ing quotation from Dorsey's account of the Turtle subgens of the 
Omaha:' 

"In the time of a fog the men of this subgens drew the figure of a 
turtle on the grouud with its face to the south. On the head, tail, 
middle of tlie back, and on each leg were placed small pieces of a (red) 
breech cloth, with some tobacco. This they imagined would make the 
fog disappear very soon." 

But it is not only the pagan Indians who have tried their hand at 
weather makiug. Their Ohristiauized descendants have also tried to 
control these operations of nature. lu the transition times between 
paganism and Christianity occurred some events which throw a curious 
and instructive side light on this question, and two of these 1 will now 
give. 

Mr. Parkman says that while the Jesuits labored with the Hurons a 
severe drought came upon the fields. The sorcerers put forth their 
utmost i)Ower, and from the tops of the houses yelled incessant invoca- 
tions to the spirits. All was in vain. A renowned "rain maker," 
seeing his reputation tottering under his repeated failures, bethought 
him of accusing the Jesuits, and gave out that the red color of the cross 
which stood Itefore their house scared away the bird of thunder and 
caused him to fly another way. On this a clamor arose. The popular 
ire turned against the priests, and the obnoxious cross was condemned 
to be cut down. The Jesuits said: "If the red color of the cross 
frightens the bird of thunder, paint it white." This was done, but the 
clouds still kept aloof. The Jesuits followed uj) their advantage. 
"Your spirits can not helyt you. Now ask the aid of Him who made the 
world." Heavy rains occurring soon after, it is said that many Indians 
believed in the white man's Great Spirit and presented themselves to 
the j)riests for baptism (Alice Elliot Keeler). 

A somewhat similar story is told of Peru by Acosta. It appears 
that the Santa Cruz Indians became Christians because of the success 
of a renegade soldier in making rain. This soldier, seeing the native 
Indians " in a great extremity for water, and that to j)rocure rain they 
used many superstitious ceremonies, according to their usual manner," 
said to them that if they would do as he said they should presently 
have rain, which they willingly offered to perform. "Then the soldier 
made a great cross, which he placed on a high and eminent place, com- 
manding them to worship it and to demand water, which they did. A 
wonderful thing to see, there presently fell such an abundance of ram, 
as the Indians took so great devotion to the holy cross as they tied 
unto it in all their necessities, and obtained all they demanded, so as 
they broke down their idols." ■^ 

The quotation from Acosta indicates the attitude of the Indians of 
middle latitudes on this subject. This attitude, as is well known to

those familiar with the Latin- American countries, is preserved 
unchanged among their desceudauts. Interesting illustrations of it can 
be picked up any day even as far north as Arizona and New Mexico, 
and every traveler in Latin- America has several at his disposal. As 
the quintessence of them all I present a clipping from the New York 
Tribune, to which my attention was called by Dr. T. C. Mendenhall. Se 
non e vero e ben trovato. The extract runs as follows : 

"In the departrnent of Castafias there had been no rain for nearly a 
year, and the people were brought to such a pass that tbey were actu- 
ally dying for thirst, to say nothing of the total destruction of all crops 
and other agricultural industries. 

"El Pueblo Catolico, of New San Savaldor, prints a number of reso- 
lutions promulgated by the principal alcalde of the town and department 
of Castaiias. They are as follows : 

" ' Considering that the Sui^reme Creator has not behaved well in this 
province, as in the whole of last year only one shower of rain fell; that 
in this summer, notwithstanding all the processions, prayers, and 
praises, it has not rained at all, and consequently the croi)S of Castafias, 
on which depend the i)rosperity of the whole department, are entirely 
ruined, it is decreed: 

"'Article 1. If within the peremptory period of eight days from the 
date of this decree rain does not fall abundantly, no one will go to mass 
or say i)rayers. 

" 'Art. 2. If the drought continues eight days more the churches and 
chapels shall be burned, and missals, rosaries, and other objects of 
devotion will be destroyed. 

" 'Art. 3. If, finally, in a third period of eight days it shall not rain, 
all the priests, friars, nuns, and saints, male and female, will be beheaded. 
And for the j)resent permission is given for the commission of all sorts 
of sin in order that the Supreme Creator may understand with whom 
he has to deal.' 

" The most remarkable feature of this affair is the fact that four days 
after these resolutions were passed the heaviest rainfall known for years 
was precipitated on the burning community." 

II. — Folklore Eemnants.^ 

Among the many curious remnants of folklore which we find in con- 
nection with the subject of weather making none is more curious than 
the idea that birds "call for rain." Whenever this expression is used 
the evident intention is, as is well known to those who are familiar 
with this mode of speech, to exj)ress the idea that they demand the 
rain, and that rain is likely to follow because of this demand. For 
instance, the call of the robin, heard so frequently, is interpreted to 
mean, " Bring out your skillet, bring out your skillet, the rain will till 
it." In popular estimation this is a " call for rain." This association 
with our American robin is very general. In Maine and Massachu- 
setts they are said to " sing for rain " (Miss F. D. Bergen). The 

' This series of associations of natural objects with weather making in the sense 
of a weather fetich — a weather maker, not simply a weather forecaster — is taken 
from the collections of weather proverbs made by the Signal Service and Weather 
Bureau. 



256 WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 

Americau quail is also said to " call for rain," and its cry is inter- 
preted to be, " More wet, more wet" (Dr. Eobert Fletcher). The call 
of the loon is given the same meaning in so widely separated localities 
as Cape Breton, the State of Washington, and Florida (Mr. C. A. 
Smith). The same power is attributed, generally in the Old World, 
to many other birds, as ducks, geese, crows, and ravens. From Penn- 
sylvania (William Schrock) comes the quaint conceptiou expressed in 
the following rhyme : 

The gooso auil the gauder 
Begin to ineauder ; 
The matter is plaiu, 
They are danciug for rain. 

But the birds are not only efit'ective in making rain ; they can exert 
still greater intiuence. The kildee, or killdeer plover, is said, in Mary- 
land, to call up the wind by his cry of " Kildee! kildee!" while to kill 
him would cause a violent storm (Dr. Fletcher). The Kiowa of Indian 
Territory attributes to the killdeer the bringing of spring (James 
Mooney, Washington). 

Another popular association between animals and rain is the idea 
that by certain treatment of some animals definite results in the way 
of rain making can be obtained. For instance, on Santee River, in 
South Carolina, it is believed that if you catch an alligator, tie him to a 
tree, and whip him to death it will be certain to bring rain (Dr. W. W. 
Anderson). This seems to be a fragment of negro folklore. In Massa- 
chusetts it is said that if you see or step on a frog it is a sure sign of 
rain, while in Maine they say, " Kill a frog and it will rain before 
morning" (Miss F. D. Bergen). This association of rain with the toad 
is general over the United States. Still another folklore remnant of 
the same sort relates to snakes. It is a curious fact that among many 
races the snake is supjDosed to have some relations with the weather. 
Mr. James Mooney says, *' The belief in a connection between rain and 
snakes is quite general among Indian tribes. The snake dance is 
intended to bring rain. The Indians of Indian Territory turn a dead 
snake on its back to bring rain." It is a jiiece of negro folklore that 
hanging a dead snake on a tree will bring rain in a few hours. Farther 
northward it runs, "Hang up a snake skin and it will bring rain." 
This refers to the cast-off skin. In northern Illinois the exi)ression is, 
" Hang uj> a snake's cast-off skin on the crab-api)le tree and it will 
bring rain." The snake has i)layed a very imi)ortant part in weather 
making, and to it has been attributed many other magical ijowers. 

An interesting series of superstitions with reference to weather 
making are those which are common to sailors, who have a well-known 
half-serious belief that one can raise wind by whistling. In New- 
foundland they say, " Stick a knife in the mainmast and whistle, and 
it must produce wind." In ]!^ewfoundland, also, they have an idea 
that if a vessel is becalmed wind can be produced by throwing over- 



WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 257 

board a halfpeuuy. Another notion, common also to the same sailors, 
is that if you put the end of the sheet overboard it will produce wind, 
and that if you hit it three times across the thwarts it will stop the 
rain. Mr. Kinahan, illustrating the sincerity of the belief in the 
power of whistling in raising wind, says: ''In a dead calm you may 
whistle for wind, except in a dangerous place. Crossing from Skib- 
bereen to Clear Island, County Cork, a friend of mine was very nearly 
getting into a row for inadvertently whistling." This belief is very 
general. In California sailors say that one may whistle softly for a 
breeze, but that it is dangerous to indulge in loud or thoughtless whist- 
ling as it may bring a gale. Here the skipper scratches the mizzen- 
mast for a fair wind. 

Sailors profess great confidence in the ability of the cat to raise the 
wind, and are accustomed to say that the cat carries the wind in her 
tail. Cats have the general reputation of being very weatherwise. On 
shipboard, especially, it is considered imprudent to provoke a cat, 
because she is assumed to have a certain share in the arrangement of 
the weather. Imprudence of this sort appears, however, to have no 
terrors for the Soudanese in western Java, for, when rain is needed, 
they form in procession with gongs and clappers, take their cats to the 
nearest streams, where the animals are sprinkled and bathed.' 

Many sailors also have a very curious notion that hens' eggs on board 
ship produce contrary'- winds, and on the occurrence of such winds they, 
are likely to insist that the eggs must be thrown overboard. 

Another of these folklore remnants of sailors is the idea that there 
is a distinct relation between the albatross and wind. This superstition 
has been embalmed in most attractive form by Coleridge in his Lay 
of the Ancient Mariner. One stanza runs as follows: 

For all averred I had killed the bird 

That made the breeze to blow. 
Oh, wretch ! said they, the bird to slay 

That made the breeze to blow. 

In addition to the above folklore remnants there are some methods 
which are purely magical. The earliest reference of this sort which I 
have found is the case of Sopater. He is said to have caused a horrible 
famine in Asia Minor by "chaining the winds." He was put to death 
by Constantine — probably for this reason, as this crime was forbidden 
by the laws of the Twelve Tables, as well as later in the Theodosian 
code. 

The association of weather making with the witches in Finland is 
familiar. Steele, in his Medieval Lore, from Bartholomew Anglicus 
(about 1260), referring to the people in Finland, says: 

"The men - - - occupy themselves with witchcraft, and so to 
men that sail by their coasts, and also to men that abide with them 
for default of wind ; they prefer wind to sailing, and so they sell wind.

They used to make a clue [skein] of thread, and tbey make divers knots 
to be kiiit thereiu, and then they command to draw out of the clue to 
three knots, more or less, as they will have the wind more soft or strong; 
and for their misbelief fiends move the air and arise strong tempests, 
or soft, as they draweth of the clue more or less knots; and sometimes 
they move the wind so strongly that the wretches that believe in such 
doings are drowned by the rightful doom of God." 

The elder bush is esj)ecially associated with weather making. The 
witches were thought to make bad weather by stirring water with 
branches of the elder. 

Still another remnant of ancient superstition is, according to Aubrey 
(1090), to the eliect that "On Malvern Hills, in Worcestershire, and 
thereabouts, when they farm their corn and want wind they cry ' Youle ! 
youle! youle!' to invite it, which word, no doubt, is a corruption of 
^olus, the god of the winds." (Dr. E. Fletcher.) 

III. — Physical Methods. 

WEATHER MAKERS. 

What precedes relates to purely psychic methods of controlling the 
weather or the elements. The collection which it presents has been 
made in no spirit of disrespect, but solely in that of "the collection and 
scientific comparison of facts. I have great respect for all sincere reli- 
gious belief and great interest in folklore remnants — fragments of what 
have once been great psychic structures — ruins about the tombs of the 
ancients. What follows is intensely fin de siecle and treats of the par- 
adoxer in a well-developed stage. The paradoxer deserves a respect to 
be measured by the sufficiency of his information and the correctness 
of his logic. He is a possible benefactor of the world, a potential great 
man. Galileo was a paradoxer — very unwelcome to the Aristotelians 
of his time. Kepler was a rank paradoxer to his contemporaries, and 
Newton was a paradoxer to the Cartesians of his day. 

Time will not be spent on rash paradoxers in the field of weather 
making. We shall only consider those who have some such guarantee 
as a patent, an appropriation, or genuine learning. As an illustration 
of the rash paradoxers, I will simply mention two, one the man who 
proposed to destroy blizzards by a line of coal stoves along our northern 
boundary from Eed River to the Continental Divide, and the other a 
man who proposed to ameliorate the weather of New England and the 
Canadian provinces by damming the Strait of Belle Isle. 

WEATHER MAKINGr. 

We pass first to the treatment for tornadoes. M. Weyher has made 
laboratory tornadoes of a mild and gentle character, but they contain 
no suggestion as to how to treat this patbologic phenomenon of the 
weather. 



WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 259 

A treatment lias been suggested, which is heroic and may possibly be 
effective. It is, however, a local application, and the chief difficulty is 
to have it ready when and where wanted. The method proposed is that 
of a great explosion in the tornado itself. Many plans have been sng- 
gested, and two patents have been granted. I will consider the first, 
that of Mr. J. B. Atwater, of Chicago (Ko. 370845, 1887). A strong 
box with a double bottom is firmly supported on a pole erected at a 
suitable point, probably a mile or so southwest of the village to be pro- 
tected. The upper bottom is fixed, and the space above it is filled with 
an explosive and firmly closed. In holes in the upi^er bottom are 
inserted fulminating caps, and these project below its lower surface. 
The lower bottom slides up and down. Then, if a high wind drives the 
lower bottom against the upper with such force as to flash the caps, 
the explosion follows, and the tornado (if present) suffers the effects 
which a tornado will suffer when a powerful explosion occurs in its 
immediate vicinity. 

What these effects will be we do not yet know. It is said, with 
enough repetition to make it fairly worthy of credence, that a cannon 
fired into a waterspout destroys the latter. If such a disturbance 
destroys the gentler waterspout, it may be worth while to try a larger 
one on the more intense tornado. Perhaps it will be effective; we can 
be more positive when it has been tried. 

Many other schemes have been proposed for the control of the ele- 
ments of the weather. Most of them have an objectionable side, notably 
in rain making, which can be pointed out here as well as elsewhere. 
It is this: The phenomenon to be produced probably can not be con- 
trolled as to area covered, and may occur where it is not wanted. If 
we are clothing merchants and I carry over too large a stock of winter 
clothing into late spring, I may order a cold wave to help me reduce 
my stock. But you may have exhausted your winter stock and wish to 
have warm weather to start your summer stock. My cold wave affects 
your trade seriously; I iuay be sued for damages. Such a state of 
things is said to have actually happened in Kansas, where a rain maker 
was refused payment by his employer because of failure of contract, 
and was sued by a neighbor of the employer because his crops were 
washed out of the ground. Should the weather maker prosper he will 
often find himself very much embarrassed until our lawmakers have 
caught up with our advance in the arts, and the volume of the statute 
books has been materially enlarged. 

RAIN MAKING. 

We come now to the subject of rain making, which has attracted 
more attention, been more tried, and has more history than any other 
one method of weather making. It has attained the dignity of at least 
two patents and two Congressional appropriations. A bibliography of 
the subject is appended, containing sixty-four titles, two of which refer 
to books devoted to this subject, by Power and Gathman, respectively. 



260 WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 

First method. — To clear tlie way for the American history we may 
note here as method No. 1 a French method reported in the Oomptes 
Eendus for October 23, 1893. M. Baudouin sent a note to the French 
Academy of Sciences in which he wrote tliat in Algeria, earlier in that 
year, he used a kite to obtain electric connection with a cloud at the 
height of about 4,000 feet. As soon as this connection was made a 
few droits of rain fell and a local fog formed. These disappeared on 
breaking the connection, presumably by withdrawing the kite from the 
cloud. M. Baudouin had obtained some rain in Algeria in 1876 by the 
same method. I know of no other experiments in this direction, nor do 
they involve anything in opposition to knowledge already acquired. 
It is a fair held for experiment, and it is remarkable that M. Baudouin's 
experiments have not attracted more attention in the United States. 

Second method. — A second proposed method of obtaining rain is by 
means of great fires. With this proposal the name of a Pennsylvania 
meteorologist, James P. Espy, is inseparably connected. In 1811 he 
published a Philosophy of Storms, in which he enlarged on this idea 
previously propounded by liim in occasional articles dating from 1838. 
The idea was not new, for Dobrizhoffer, a Jesuit missionary in South 
America, in his Account of the Al)ii)ones (first published in 1781), 
says that these Indians produced rain by setting fire to the plains. 
Indeed the idea has been and is generally entertained, and in the West 
has crystallized into the weather proverb, "A very large prairie fire will 
cause rain." To show something of the character of the testimony on 
which Espy relied we shall (piote the story of George Mackay as given 
in a letter to Espy and printed by him in his Fourth Meteorological 
Eeport (pp. 32-34). Mr. Mackay says: 

"In 1815 I was engaged in the i>ublic survey on the Atlantic coast 
of Florida, k^ometime in April (the time of the dry season there, 
which lasts up to June) I was running a township line between lati- 
tudes 26° and 27°, about 5 miles from the sea. The weather was 
oppressively warm that day. There was not air enough stirring to 
move an aspen leaf. We found our line must pass through a saw-grass 
pond, containing about 500 acres. In ponds of this description the 
green grass at the top shoots up from 5 to 6 1'eet in height, and when the 
region has not been for some years swept clear by tires the dead and 
dry growths of preceding seasons accumulate under tlie latest growth, 
and are often found there from 2 to 4 feet in depth. They are exceed- 
ingly inflammable. When lighted in dry weather they burn with friglit- 
ful ra[)idity and violence. Whenever, in our explorations, we came upon 
a jdace of tliis description we could only pass our line by cutting away 
the lofty fresh grass and wading (or rather wallowing) through the 
nuid and the underrubbish. On the day in question Ave determined, 
as it was so hot, that to save ourselves troul)le we would burn our way 
through. I had then no thought of your theory. In order to prevent 
the flames from running over the woods, through which we were 
obliged to pass, we communicated them at once to both sides of the 
spot we desired to open, that they might converge and combine in its 
center and not scatter latterally. In a very few minutes an awful blaze 
swept over the entire surface which we had marked out for our purpose. 



WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 261 

We then crossed our line. Ere we had proceeded over 40 chains a 
delightful breeze sprang up and cooled the atmosphere, and presently 
a refreshing shower sparkled in the bright rays of the sun. All this 
excited no further observation than that it had not rained there before 
for a long time. 1 myself did not observe any smoke nor the formation 
of any cloud. 

"(-)ur work went on for some days without a repetition of our short 
cut at pioneering, sonje objection having been made when another burn- 
ing was proposed, because the first one had rendered it diflieult, after 
crossing the lines, to distinguish the white men from the negroes. At 
length, however, the pleasant breezes ceased, which had made the 
weather for a while endurable, and the still air and ijitense heat 
returned, and with them constant murnuirs from the men, especially the 
negroes, whose duty it was to cut lines and mark trees. We were now 
on the confines of a saw- grass pond, and a much more formidable one 
than any we had yet encountered. Being surrounded by a cypress 
swamp, we concluded that it had never yet been burned. My assistant, 
Capt. Alexander Mackay, who was standing by my side, mentioned his 
having, in our late contiagration, observed the formation of a cloud at 
the apex of the smoke. He added tliat it had frequently since brought 
to his mind some account which he had read of Professor Espy's theory. 
He suggested that there could not be a better opportunity than this to 
put tlie theory to the test, and being fond of a joke, he said he would 
like to astonish the superstitious negroes and to make them believe 
that he could call together the clouds and bring down rain. So we 
determined to make the exi)eriment. 

"When our party was all gathei'ed at the halting place coraplaints 
of the extreme heat went around, and all unanimously agreed that a 
more confined and oppressive day had never been known to them. To 
these complaints the usual wishes for ' a little breath of air ' and ' a few 
drops of rain ' succeeded. ' Cut through this pond,' exclaimed the Cap- 
tain, ' and I will bring you more than a few drops of rain ; I'll give you 
a plentiful shower and a breeze, too, that shall wake you up. Come, 
boys, cut away, and when you've done you shall wash off the dust in a 
cold bath from the skies.' They stared up and around; not a cloud as 
large as a man's hand was to be seen, and they looked back at the Cap- 
tain with a good natured grin of incredulity. 'Ho, ho! ha, ha! Cap- 
tain make cloud out o' nufhu'; he, he! Captain bring water all dis wtiy 
fromdeseaf Ho, ho! ha, ha! he, he!' Whereupon the Captain affected 
to be very indignant. To hasten his victory 1 ordered the grass to be 
set on tire. The fiames soared forthwith above the tallest trees; a 
dense volume of smoke mounted upward spirally; the grass soon dis- 
appeared ; we crossed over. As the smoky column broke and the cloud 
began to form, the Captain traced a large circle in the sand around 
him, and placed himself in its center, making fantastic figures and 
forming cabalistic phrases out of broken French. Still was the cloud 
unnoticed. All eyes Avere riveted upon the Captain, who stood gazing 
at the earth and shaping outlines of devils there. At this juncture 
came a roll of distant thunder. Every glance instantly turned upward ; 
a cloud was spreading there; the thunders increased; the lightnings 
flashed more vividly; the knees of the negroes shook together with 
alarm. Already was the rain descending, and in torrents,"though the 
clear sky could be seen in all directions under the cloud. The Captain 
meanwhile maintained his mystical attitude and continued his wild and 
extraordinary evolutions. Some of the whites, who were in the secret 
of the hoax, fell upon their knees, and were imitated by the negroes, 



262 WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 

wliose fears augmenting as the storm grew fiercer, with clasped hands 
fastened ui)on the Captain a stare of awe and deprecation. In short, 
the scene presented a more complete triumph of philosophy over igno- 
rance than I conld liave supposed it possible to have been produced 
anywhere in the nineteenth century, and most especially anywhere in 
our enlightened Eepublic. 

"We often tired the saw-grass marshes afterwards, and whenever 
there was no wind stirring we were sure to get a shower; and I say 
with perfect confidence that we never had a shower in April or May at 
any otlier time. Sometimes when there was a breeze it would carry 
the smoke toward the horizon, where there would seem to be a fall of 
rain." 

Espy dwelt on this theory with great devotion, and in 1S45 pub- 
lished a special letter addressed "To the friends of science,'' in which 
he proposed a plan for practical rain production. As the paper in 
question is now very rare and his i^lan possesses some features of inter- 
est, I quote it here: 

"Let masses of timber to the amount of 40 acres for every 20 miles 
be i)repared and fired simultaneoiisly every seven days in the sunmier 
on the west of the United States, in a line of 600 or TOO miles long from 
north to soutli ; then the following results seem highly probable, but 
not certain until the experiment is made: A rain of great length north 
and south will commence near or on the line of tire; this rain will 
travel eastward; it will not break up till it reaches far into tbe 
Atlantic Ocean; it will rain over the wliole country east of the place of 
beginning; it will rain only a short time in any one place; it will not 
rain again until the next seventh day; it will rain enough and not too 
much in any one place; it will not be attended with violent wind, 
neither on land nor on the Atlantic Ocean; there will be no hail nor tor- 
nadoes at the time of the general rain nor intermediate; there will be 
no destructive floods, nor will the waters ever become very low; there 
will be no more oppressive heats nor injurious colds; the farmers and 
mariners will always know before the rains when they will commence 
and when they will terminate; all epidemic diseases originating from 
floods and subsequent droughts will cease; the proceeds of agriculture 
will be greatly increased, and the health and happiness of the citizens 
will be much promoted. These, I say, are the probable — not certain — 
results of the plan i)roposed — a plan which could be carried into oper- 
ation for a sum which would not amount to half a cent a year to each 
individual in the United States; a plan, which, if successful, would 
benetit in ai high degree not merely the landsman, but every mariner 
that plies the Atlantic. If this scheme should appear too gigantic to 
commence with let the trial be first made along the Alleghany Moun- 
tains; and let 40 acres of four 10- acre lots be fired every seven days 
through the summer in each of the counties of McKean, Clearfield, 
Cambria, and Somerset, in Pennsylvania; Allegany, in Maryland, and 
Hardy, rendleton, Bath, Alleghany, and Montgomery, in Virginia. 
The 10-acre lots "should be, as nearly as convenient, from 1 to 4 miles 
apart, in the form of a square, so that the up-moving column of air 
which shall be formed over them may have a wide base, and thus may 
ascend to a considerable height before it may be leaned out of the per- 
pendicular by any wind which may exist at the time." 

Espy's theory was i^ractically the modern convective theory of storms, 
and to this most worthy student of science is due the credit of calling 



WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 263 

effective attention to the part wliich the condensation of aqueous vapor 
plays in tlie niecliauism of storms. 

Third method. — Another i)roposed method of making rain artificially 
is that of L. Gathman, of Chicago, patented in 1891 (No. 462795). His 
method is to '^ suddenly chill the atmosphere by rapid evaporation, and 
it is also advisable to produce a heavy concussion in connection with 
the cooling in order to set the different air currents in motion. It is 
obvious that sudden and rapid evaporation in the upper regions of 
the atmosphere could be accomplished in various ways by the evapora- 
tion of various highly compressed gases; but the evaporation conse- 
quent upon the release of liquefied carbonic acid gas is thought to be 
the most efficient." He proceeds : 

" In accordance, therefore, with my invention, liquefied carbonic acid 
gas is liberated in the upper regions of the atmosphere and will, of 
course, instantly evaporate and spread out in a sheet of vapor of an 
extremely low temperature and produce a cloud. The surrounding 
atmosphere will be chilled by its proximity to the cold vapor, and the 
moisture in the atmosphere will be condensed thereby. The condensa- 
tion takes place in large quantities and with great rapidity, so that a 
cloud IS formed that will precipitate a rainfall upon the earth. 

"The liquefied carbonic acid gas can be confined in a suitable shell 
or casing, said casing also to contain an explosive — gunpowder, dyna- 
mite, etc. — which is thrown or shot into the upper regions of the atmos- 
phere and there exploded by a time fuse. A balloon, moreover, could 
be employed to elevate the shell or casing containing the liquefied 
carbonic acid gas, and the explosion to liberate the gas could be made 
by an electric current controlled by persons upon the earth." 

Mr. Gathman also published a little book in which were reproduced, 
witli approval. Professor Newcomb's article entitled, "Can we make it 
rain ? " and Professor Houston's "Artificial rain making." In this book 
we learn that Mr. Gathman has been occupied Avith the use of con- 
densed carbon anhydride to cool heavy guns, and was led to his theory 
by the results of his experiments with ordnance. He also exi)erimented 
on his method of rain making, and says (p. 38) : 

"In making some experiments last year, a shell filled with liquefied 
carbonic acid gas was exploded at a height of 000 feet; a cloud was 
produced in the clear sky at once, and, floating along on a current of 
air, was visible for miles. This experiment was made in July, 1890, 
and since that time I have made sufficient other experiments to satisfy 
myself that I can produce rain whenever necessary, or at will. Exper- 
iments made in my astronomical observatory, at a height of only 75 
feet, have proven that by the evaporation of liquefied carbonic acid gas 
a rain shower on a small scale can be produced with but a small quan- 
tity of the gas. When completed arrangements have been made, the 
experiments mentioned will be seen to be but a step to the practical 
illustration on a grand scale." 

It appears that in Gathmau's method the explosion plays a very sub- 
ordinate part; but in the method to follow the explosion is the main, if 
not the only, thing. 

Fourth method. — The concussion theory is probably an old one, 
though it is not correct to refer it to Plutarch, as is sometimes done. 



264 WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 

In his life of Marius, referring to tlie battle with the Teutons near Aix, 
in July, 102 B. C, Plutarch says: "Extraordinary rains pretty gen- 
erally fall after great battles; whether it be that some divine power 
thus washes and cleanses the polluted earth with showers from above? 
or that moist and heavy evaporations steaming forth from the blood 
and corruption thicken the air, which naturally is subject to alteration 
from tbe smallest causes." ^ Here are two distinct suggestions for rain 
making, but not that of concussion. 

The first elaborate treatment of the concussion theory appears to 
have been by Edward Powers, civil engineer, who published in 1890 a 
book on the relations of battles to rainfall. The first edition was 
printed in Chicago in 1871, but most of the edition was destroyed by 
the great fire in tliat city, which also destroyed the stereotype plates. 
The latest issue seen by me contains an inset of 15 pages devoted to 
a criticism of Professor lifewcomb's article already mentioned. The 
aim of this book is to prove that great battles or heavy cannonading 
are usually soon followed by rainfall. A fair criticism of the book is 
that such phenomena are not invariably followed by rain. The coinci- 
dences could be explained by the fact that in the season of military 
operations rain is usually falling somewhere in eastern United States; 
that in fact it is not clear but that the rain is a pure coincidence. The 
argument is not conclusive. Indeed, it is only fair to say that under 
the conditions involved it could not be made conclusive. Mr. Powers, 
however, did not despond, but used his utmost endeavors to bring the 
matter to a test. For this purpose he persuaded Senator Farwell, in 
1874, to present a petition to Congress asking that the theory be tried. 
This, with a j)revious i)etition to which he refers, seems to have been 
without response on the part of Congress, 

Later, and apparently independently, the matter was taken up by 
Gen. Daniel Kuggles, of Fredericksburg, Va., who obtained a patent 
in 1880 (No. 230067) on making rain by explosions in the clouds. His 
claim runs: 

" The nature of my invention consists in sending one or more balloons 
into the cloud realms, said balloon or balloons carrying torpedoes and 
cartridges charged with explosives, and there to explode or detonate 
them by magneto-electric or electric force through metallic wire, tex- 
tile cordage, or by the fuse, or by mechanical force, in order to precipi- 
tate rainfall by concussion or vibration of the atmosphere." 

General Euggles succeeded in bringing the matter before Congress, 
but did not succeed in getting an appropriation. His plan was much 
discussed in the newspapers at the time, but does not seem to have 
reached the experimental stage. 

Senator Farwell, however, continued his interest in the matter, and 
in 1890 finally succeeded in obtaining an appropriation, first of $2,000,

390, 391.

then of $7,000, for carryiugon the experimeuts, some of which he had 
already had made at his own expense. The ajjpropriation assigned the 
condnct of the experiments to the Department of Agriculture, and the 
Secretary selected E. G. Dyrenforth for the work. The experiments 
were carried on in the vicinity of Washington and in Texas. A report 
from Mr. Dj^renforth was i^nblished by Congress in 1892. At the next 
session of Congress another ajtpropriation of $10,000 was made for this 
purpose, of which the sum of $1,913.59 was expended, as before, under 
Dyrenforth's direction, the remainder having been covered back into 
the Treasury. 

Mr. Dyrenforth's methods were highly iugeuious. He used a variety 
of explosives, on the ground and in the air, by great single explosions 
and by volleys. He introduced many novelties, among them that of 
exploding the gas in the balloon itself when high in the air. His con- 
clusions, as stated by himself in his first report, were (p. 59): 

"First. That when a moist cloud is present, which, if undisturbed, 
would pass away without precipitating its moisture, the Jarring of the 
cloud by concussions will cause the particles of moisture in suspension to 
agglomerate and fall in greater or less (|uantity, according to the degree 
of moistness of the air in and beneath the cloud. 

" Second. That by taking advantage of those periods which frequently 
occu^r in droughts, and in most if not in all sections of the United States 
where precipitation is insuflUcient for vegetation, and during which 
atmospheric conditions fiivor rainfall, without there being actual rain, 
precipitation may be caused by concussion. 

"Third. That under the most unfavorable conditions for precipita- 
tion, conditions which need never be taken in operations to ])roduce 
rain, storm conditions may be generated and rain be induced, there 
being, however, a wasteful expenditure of both time and material in 
overcoming unfavorable conditions." 

His second report has not been published, but 1 infer that his second 
series of observations were believed by him to confirm the results of the 
first. 

Mr. Dyrenforth generally omitted one check which he might well 
have employed, and which I i^ersonally urged him to employ. Experi- 
ments of this sort, made in the free air, with the accompanying condi- 
tions not under control, should be accompanied with every i)0ssible 
check; and one self-evident and very necessary one is the observation 
of a physicist familiar with the meteorologic side of physics. Such an 
expert (Mr. G. E. Curtis) accompanied the party in its first experiments. 
His report (except the bare meteorologic record made during the exper- 
iments) does not accompany Dyrenforth's document. It was i)re- 
sented, however, to the Philosophical Society of Washington, and was 
printed elsewhere. Mr. Curtis says, substantially, that an explosion in 
a cloud brings down a few scattering drops of rain, and this may 
happen even with an explosion on the ground, if heavy. Otherwise he 
says there was no rain making. It is but fair to say that with Mr. 
Dyrenforth's report are given the reports of his assistants, Mr. John 



266 WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 

T. Ellis, Lieut. S. A. Dyer, aud Mr. Eugeue Faircliild, and tbey were 
stronger in the expression of a belief that rain Avas successfully made 
than is Mr. Dyreuforth; aud there are also many favorable quotations 
from spectators. 

Prof. A, Macfarlane, of the University of Texas, was present as an 
uninvited guest during the elaborate experiments near San Antonio on 
Friday, ISTovember 25, 1892, beginning at 4 }). m. The sky was from 
time to time overcast, and the natural conditions were not unfavorable 
for rain. Many explosions were made without rain until late in the 
evening, from whicli jioint I will take up the story in Professor Macfar- 
lane's own w^ords, as given in a letter to the New York World Decem- 
ber 4, 1892: 

"At 10.15 a balloon was sent up and was lost in the darkness; when 
it exploded a very large area of light was seen, as if the explosion had 
occurred inside a cloud. There was no fall of rain at the camp, and 
nobody was stationed below the spot where the balloon exploded. 

"I consider this the only experiment that was worth making, yet no 
care was taken to observe whether rain did fall. It is conceivable that 
the explosion of a 12-foot balloon inside a cloud ready to precipitate may 
jar the particles so as to quicken the dropping of the rain. This was 
the idea of Euggles. But to test whether some rain can be drawn down 
in this manner from a rain cloud does not suit the ideas of cranks who 
wish to get a large something out of an absolute nothing. 

"At 10.45 a mist became just perceptible. The General issued an 
order to get ready the rain gauge. The boys hurried up a balloon, 
which was nearly ready, but it had no effect on that mist. 

"At 11.40 the mist ceased, and the stars appeared in places nearly 
overhead. The General apparently felt that things were going against 
him, for he suggested to the ] )octor to put a snuxll piece of dynamite in 
the shells, and also to try the eilect of an explosion down at the springs. 

"At 12.30 a 12-foot balloon went well into the cloud, but no rain 
eifect. 

"At 1 o'clock, the time when operations were to be suspended for the 
night, it was fair, with some stars visible, and the boys were preparing 
one more balloon. Colonel King remarked that it would be necessary 
to keej) up the operations for forty-eight hours. I retired to a room in 
the hotel, from which I could see the operations. 

"At 1.30 1 heard a slight shout from the balloon boys, and I could 
hear tlie rain pattering on the roof. The General, who had also retired 
to the hotel, threw open the window and called out: 'Hurry up, boys.' 
After ten minutes the balloon was exploded, and the rain almost 
immediately diminished so as to be scarcely percej^tible. When the 
explosion occurred I had my head out of the window. The hotel, a 
frame house, shook considerably, but there was no breaking of glass 
or any of the effects produced by a powerful explosion on the solid 
earth. 

"At 1.50 the General went out to observe, and I heard him say: 
'There is a beautiful rain to the north of us and to the west of us,' 

"At 2 the rain had entirely ceased, and the last of the oi)erations 
consisted of two shells fired in succession at 2.05." 

Professor Macfarlane is a competent physicist. He was trained in 
Edinburgh, and has, I believe, no such appreciation of humor as to

make him unconsciously color his report. His conclusions were adverse 
to the rain makers. 

Eeferring in general to the experiments in Texas, one fact has been 
generally overlooked. The rainfall in western Texas is always small, 
but it is subject to its maxima and minima, 4ike other regions. Now, 
there is a rainfall season in July and August in Arizona and New 
Mexico, and this reaches western Texas. Thirty per cent of the annual 
rainfall descends in these two months along the eastern border of New 
Mexico and in the western angle of Texas. At El Paso this percentage 
is 40. This maximum passes gradually eastward and is found in the 
southeastern part n Sej)tember. The experiments in the western part 
of Texas in 1891 were in September, fairly in the time of this maxi- 
mum. There is another maximum of rainfall in Texas in November. 
This is in the northeastern part of the State. The second series of 
rainfall exjieriments in Texas was in November, 1892, at San Antonio. 
The maximum here occurs in September, but there is in November an 
average (for twenty-four years) of 2.5 inches, or one-twelfth of the 
annual 30.6 inches. There is a high relative probability of rain nat- 
urally in September in the region of the experiments in 1891, and there 
is an even chance of it in the region of 1892. To test the theory of 
rain making in Texas the months might have been better chosen; yet 
it is but fair to say that the rainfall in western Texas is very fluctu- 
ating, as it comes generally in local storms. 

Fifth meiliod. — There is another method of rain making which is still 
a mystery, but which deserves mention because it has been submitted 
to actual test. I have not been given i)6rmission to use names in this 
case, and will only guarantee that the letter which I quote came from 
a high official of a railway company and is worthy of the credence 
which an official business letter of this sort should carry with it. This 
gentleman, under date of August 22, 1893, wrote to me as follows: 

"Dear Sir: Your letter, August 10, - - - has been referred to 
me. In reply thereto, we have no published reports concerning rain- 
making experiments such as mentioned by you. While these experi- 
ments have been made by a couple of employees of this company, we 
can say but little about them ourselves. These i)arties claimed to be 
able to cause rainfall by artificial means, and we have furnished them 
with materials, together with transportation facilities, more or less all 
the time since the early part of May, they having experimented in some 
eighteen or twenty different locations, and in each case we have had 
more or less rainfall. In nearly every instance we can but feel there is 
something in their claim. We have had from one-half to 3 or 3J inch 
falls of rain, covering a section of country from 25 t<» 90 miles in length 
and 10 to 30 miles wide, all owing to the direction of the wind, and in 
some cases at times when there was no moisture in sight or known until 
they began operations, and then only throughout the section over which 
their own rainfall extended. 

"I presume the operators themselves have kept a record of their 
work, and results of same, at each of the different points where they 
have been located, and should you desire I will have them make a state- 



268 WEATHER MAKING, ANCIENT AND MODERN. 

meut showing wbat they themselves feel they have accomi^lished. We 
have been slow to believe there was anything- in this bnsiness, but at 
the same time must admit that they are either very fortunate in reach- 
ing the ditferent points where they have experimented jnst in time to 
have rain storms, or they have certainly hit upon the right thing in the 
way of rain making." 

The process I do not know, but a humorous railway man, personally 
cognizant of the matter, told me that the operators kept themselves 
carefully secluded in a freight car with a hole in the roof, and when 
occasional glimpses were caught of them they seemed to be cooking- 
over a red-hot coal stove. Probably the method employed was that of 
Frank Melbourne, the Australian, who has most reputation in the 
West, and who has carefully kept his secret. It is proposed by the 
company in question to continue the experiments in another field and 
with competent experts accompanying, and another railroad company 
is seriously considering the proi)riety of entering the field. 

CONCLUSIONS. 

Finally, permit me to complete this sketch by some remarks; and, to 
make them as specific as they can be made, permit me to put them in 
the form of questions and answers. The answers are my own. 

Q. Will a noise make rain? — A. No; there is no reason in theory or 
practice to make us think it will. 

Q. Will a concussion make rain? — A. It will probably jostle the 
droplets in a cloud and may bring a few together, which may coalesce 
and become large enough to cause them to fall to the ground — a few 
scattering drojDS only. 

Q. Will smoke or dust released in great quantities i^roduce rain ? — 
A. Floating particles of spongy texture will absorb the moisture hygro- 
scopically. If the air is dry this will make it drier, and prevent rain. 
If the air is very moist and near saturation, any solid particles in the 
air will facilitate the condensation; witness the experiments of Aitken 
and IJarus. Thus, when other conditions are very tavorable, an addi- 
tion of much dust or smoke to the air might determine a fall of rain. 

Q. Will the expansion of carbon anhydride produce rain? — A. Mr. 
Gathman says he has tried it and with success. Experiments should 
be made systematically. 

Q. Will electric connection with a cloud aid in rain formation ? — A. 
M. Baudouin says it does. 

Q. Will a confiagration produce rain? — A. Quite probably, under 
favorable circumstances. It acts in the line in which nature acts, 
according to the best of our knowledge. Condensation is the result of 
chilling the air. The theory of chilling by mixture, the Huttonian 
theory, a century old, is now known to be inefticient. The chilling in 
nature seems to be due either to the ascent of air and its consequent 
expansion and loss of heat, or the chilling of one cloud by having the 
shadow of a higher cloud fall on it in sunlight. The chilUng by ascent

is the method evoked in the Espy i)lan, aud appears to be by all odds 
the most eftective rain producer in nature. 

Q. If rain can be made, how much will it cost? — A. This is truly an 
American question, and quite appropriate to the fin de siecle. Mr. 
Powers, who, by the way, says that Mr. Dyrenforth did not after all 
really try his experiment, put the cost of one experiment with Govern- 
ment aid at $80,000. Gathman says he can sprinkle the earth at a cost 
of from $30 to $90 a square mile. Espy jiroposed to fire the low forest 
growths at regular intervals at a cost less than 5 mills per citizen per 
year. The method of concussion costs the comfort and peace of all 
within hearing, a cost which a much more certain result would not 
justify.

VARIATION OF LATITUDE.' 



By J. K. Rees. 



The question is frequently asked, "How can latitude change'?" 
There are two ways, obviously. First, we may imagine that a portion 
of the earth slips on the surface of the globe, due, say, to earthquake 
shock. Then if the movement of the mass has been toward the 
equator the latitude of that place is decreased; if toward the pole of 
the earth the latitude is increased. But suppose that some forces at 
work on the earth cause it to revolve about a new axis, then we 
have at once a new equator, and the latitudes of all points on the 
earth's surface change except at those places where the old and new 
equator iutersect. 

If, for example, the earth's axis of revolution should be changed so 
as to pass through this hall, the latitude would be chauged from a 
little over 40°, as it now is, to 90°. There are changes no doubt pro- 
duced by the slipping of portions of the earth's strata, but we know 
that these causes are insiguificant and local. The only way that lati- 
tudes could be made to change throughout the world would be by 
changes in the axis of rotation of the earth, thus changing tbe position 
of the equator. 

Are there any undisputed evidences of a variation in the latitude of 
a place, and is it large? 

To day the evidence is overwhelming, but the amount is small; so 
small, in fact, that only the refined instruments of the present day 
have been able to discover it; though now, that it is discovered, older 
observations show it. 

Laplace, in his Mecanique Celeste (Tome V, p. 22), says : "All astron- 
omy depends ujion the invariability of the earth's axis of rotation and 
upon the uniformity of this rotation." 

He considered that down to the beginning of this century astrom- 
ical instruments had not been able to show any variation of latitudes.

272 VARIATION OF LATITUDE. 

There were differences, but these he thought could be accounted for as 
errors of observation.' 

To-day, however, we feel certain that small variations in latitude are 
taking place, but so small that practically, in map making, for example, 
and in navigation, they are of no importance, though scientifically very 
important. 

It might also, in this connection, be stated that there are theoretical 
reasons which seem to indicate that the earth's rotation time is not 
only changing, but also is not altogether uniform. The effect of the 
tide wave as it moves west over the earth is to act as a friction brake 
on the revolving earth, and so slow up the rotation time; and as this 
tide effect is not always the same the retarding effects differ, and theo- 
retically produce a nonuniformity in the rotation time. But the shrink- 
age of the earth, due to loss of heat, would tend to make it revolve 
more rapidly. These effects may work against each other. However, 
observations and calculations to-day do not furnish us with any certain 
evidence that the rotation time is longer or shorter than it was ten 
centuries ago. 

It no doubt will happen that, when observations and instruments 
are much improved, astronomers will discover these slight changes in 
rotation time that theory seems to require. 

The idea that the latitudes of places change is not a new one. 

Down to about the time that the telescope was invented there were 
many learned persons who believed that the latitudes of places changed 
several degrees in the course of centuries. These ideas were based on 
a comparison of maps made at different times. 

A disciple of the illustrious Copernicus considered that the evidence 
was conclusive, and was satisfied that the pole of the earth was chang- 
ing its position in a progressive manner; he considered that in time 
the torrid and frigid zones would change places. 

Plowever, these views of Dominique Maria de Ferrare were founded 
on poor data. The latitudes of a few places had been determined, by 
very im])erfect means, in the best way they had, viz, from the shadow 
cast by a gnomon; but the latitudes of many places on the maps were 
put in from the accounts of travelers, the time it took to travel from 
one point to another being used as the basis of calculation. 

Even in these enhghtened days, as we like to consider them, there is 
no good map of our own Empire State. The latitudes of a few points 
only in New York State have been determined with accuracy. But 
there are many i)laces in the State whose positions are not known 
within more tlian a mile. 

In the latter part of the sixteenth century Tycho Brahe, of Denmark, 
improved the instruments in use (without the telescope), and later, 
about 1010, the telescope was discovered and applied to astronomical 
instruments. Then new and more accurate methods were used to

of latitude," read before the A. A. A. S., at Madison, Wis., August, 1893. 



VAKIATION OF LATITUDE. 273 

determine latitude, and the large discrepancies disappeared. Some 
observers found differences between latitudes determined in winter 
and in summer, and tbey supposed those differences to be due to 
changes of the pole. 

In the latter part of the seventeenth century J. D. Cassini summed 
up the state of the problem in his day, and arrived at the conclusion 
that, notwithstanding the apparent variations in the latitudes, the 
pole of the earth did not change to any large extent; that most of the 
apparent changes in latitude were due to errors of observation and 
defects in theory; but he thought it probable that small changes did 
occur in tlie position of the pole; he thought the changes were peri- 
odic, and did not amount to more than 2 minutes of arc, equal to about 
12,000 feet. "Thus, instead of several degrees wliich were conceded 
by the astronomers of previous centuries, but a paltry 2 minutes was 
now allowed ; but with improved instruments, with the discovery of 
aberration and nutation and the perfection of the theory of refraction 
even this modest allowance was gradually reduced to a vanishing 
quantity." 

The geologists in their investigations have found fossil remains in 
the cold regions of the North belonging to the Miocene, Upper and 
Lower Cretaceous, Jurassic, and other geological iieriods, which seem 
to indicate a former temperature much higher than the present. In 
1876 Dr. John Evans, then president of the British Geological Society, 
discussed the problem, and concluded that the amount of polar light 
and lieat in the past must have been much greater than it is now. He 
invited the attention of the mathematicians to this problem, and 
asked: "Would a considerable elevation and depression of the sea 
bottoms and continents produce a change of 15 to 20 degrees in the 
position of the pole?" 

Sir WiUiam Thomson discussed this problem and gave his conclu- 
sions in 1876 to the British Association for Advancement of Science. 
He said: "Consider the great facts of the Himalayas and Andes and 
Africa, and the depths of the Atlantic, and America and the depths of 
the Pacific, and Australia; and consider further the ellipticity of the 
equatorial section of the sea level, estimated by Colonel Clarke at about 
one-tenth of the mean ellipticity of the meridianal sections of the sea 
level. We need no brush from a comet's tail to account for a change 
in the earth's axis ; we need no violent convulsions producing a sudden 
distortion on a great scale, with change of axis of maximum moment 
of inertia, followed by gigantic deluges; and we may not merely admit, 
but assert as highly probable, that the axis of maximum inertia and 
the axis of rotation, always near one another, may have been in ancient 
times very far from their x^resent geographical position, and may have 
gradually shifted through 10, 20, 30, or 40 or more degrees without at 
any time any perceptible sudden disturbance of either land or water." 

Sir William Thomson gave no account of the calculations made by 
him as the basis of these conclusions.

274 VARIATION OF LATITUDE. 

Ill 1877 Mr. Gr. H. Darwin made a careful and elaborate mathematical 
discussion of the i^roblera. He showed that in a perfectly rigid globe 
the jiole could not have wandered more than 3 degrees from its orig- 
inal position as the result of the continents and oceans changing places. 
"If, however, the earth is sufficiently plastic to admit of readjustment 
to new forms of equilibrium, by earthquakes and otherwise, possible 
changes of 10 or 15 degrees may have occurred. This would require, 
however, such a complete changing about of the continents and oceans, 
with maximum elevations and depressions in precisely the most favor- 
able places, as has certainly never occurred in geologic times." 

The evidence indicates in fact that the, continental areas have always 
occupied about the same positions as now. 

Thus it would seem that the geologists must abandon the hypothesis 
of great changes in latitude as a factor in the earth's development, 
unless a new cause can be found that will move the pole to the extent 
required by the geologists. 

In an address made before Section A, of the British Association in 
1892, Professor Shuster stated that he believed the evidence at hand 
was in favor of the view that there was sufficient matter in interplan- 
etary space to make it a conductor of electricity. This conductivity, 
however, must be small, for if it were not, he said, the earth would 
gradually set itself to revolve about its magnetic poles. However, 
changes in the x)osition of the magnetic poles would tend to prevent 
this result. Perhaps the investigator in the near future, working on 
the suggestion of Dr. Shuster, may find some connection between the 
earth's magnetism, rotation time, and position of rotation axis. 

The evidence then, at this phase of the discussion, is in favor of the 
view that there is no adequate reason for believing that any large 
changes of latitude, amounting to several degrees, have occurred in 
geologic times. The evidence shows, however, that there are small 
changes. Are they progressive; does the north pole of tLe earth wan- 
der slowly but surely farther and farther away from its positions of 
ages gone by "? 

At the International Geodetic Congress held in 1883 at Eome, Sig. 
Fergola, of the Royal Observatory, Oappodimonti, IsTaiiles, gave a 
tabular statement which seemed to show that small but progressive 
changes had taken place in Europe and America. This table showed, 
for example, that the latitude of Washington, D. C, had decreased 
from 1815 to 18G5, 0.47"; at Paris, from 1825 to 1853, the decrease was 
1.8"; at Milan in sixty years, 1.5"; at Eome during fifty-six years, 
0.17"; at Naples in fifty-one years, 0.22"; at Konigsberg in twenty- 
three years, 0.15"; at Greenwich in nineteen years, 0.51". Fergola, at 
the congress mentioned, suggested a plan for making systematic obser- 
vations, and he pointed out the favorable location of several observa- 
tories that were on nearly the same circle of latitude, but differing 
widely in longitude. Unfortunately this suggestion of Pergola's was 
not carried out in any way until 1892, when the Columbia College

Observatory arranged to work in conjunction with the Naples Observa- 
tory on the problem. This series of observations was begun in the 
spring of 1893, and will be continued several years. 

The data given by Fergola at Rome in 1883 showed a diminution of 
latitude in every case; other data showed a similar diminution; how- 
ever there were exceptions, where the latitudes seemed to increase. 

The investigations that have been going on since 1883 throw doubt 
on the progressive changes in latitude, or at least such changes are 
masked by proved i)eriodic changes. 

For a long time, since 1705, periodic changes have been looked for, 
because the theory of a rotating earth, an earth having the form of a 
sphere flattened at the poles, or, more accurately, an ellipsoid of revo- 
lution, demanded such changes; but the theory did not furnish any 
clue to the amount of changes, except that they must be very small. 
This theory shows that if the earth were absolutely rigid and revolved 
about its shortest axis (called the axis of figure) at any time it would 
continue to revolve about such axis forever, unless disturbed by some 
outside force. If so disturbed, then the axis of rotation would no longer 
coincide with the axis of figure — the axis of rotation would intersect 
the earth's surface at points away from the points where the axis of 
figure comes out. But the theory also showed that the new axis of 
rotation would revolve about the old one in a period of 301.8 days. 
This period comes from the knowledge of the magnitude of precession 
and nutation, and is known very accurately. 

We would expect therefore that changes in latitude would show this 
305-day period. 

Several attempts have been made to determine the distance between 
the two axes (figure and rotation axis) from changes in latitudes. 

The celebrated astronomer Bessel made the first attempt, and was 
unsuccessful it was supposed until recently.^ 

' Tisseraud says iu Ann. Bur. Long., 1895 (p. 42, B. 11), that there is a letter of Ajiril 
7, 1846, in which Hnmbohlt replies to Gauss that Bessel had told him in 1844 that his 
observations showed that his latitude had decreased 0.3" in two years. Bessel 
attributed this variation to cliauges accomplished in the interior of the globe. See 
also Hagan's letter in Astr. Nacli., September, 1894, 

In this connection it ought to be noted also that Prof, J. C. Maxwell read a paper 
April 20, 1857, before the Royal Society of Edinburgh (see Transactions Roy. Soc. 
Edinburgh, Vol. XXI, Part IV, pp. 559-571), "On a dynamical top for exhibiting the 
phenomena of the motion of a system of invariable form about a fixed point, with 
some suggestions as to the earth's motion." He deduced a period of 325.6 solar days. 
He examined the observations of Polaris made with the Greenwich transit circle in 
the years 1851-1854. He found the apparent colatitude of Greenwich for each month 
of the four years specified. 

There api:)eared a very slight indication of a maximum belonging to the set of 
months, March, 1851; February, 1852; December, 1852 ; November, 1853 ; September, 
1854. "This result," he says, "is to be regarded as very doubtful, as there did not 
appear to be evidence for any variation exceeding half a second of space, and more 
observations would be required to establish the existence of so small a variation 
at all," 



276 VARIATION OF LATITUDE. 

Observatious were also made at Pulkova, Eiissia, Greenwicli, and 
Wasbiugtou. Tbe Wasbingtoii observatious were made between 18G2 
and 1867, and included six complete periods of 305 days eacb. A rig- 
orous discussion by Newcomb gave tbe separation of tbe axes as 3 feet, 
or 0.03". 

C. A. F. Peters, of Pulkova, bad in 1842, obtained 0.079"= 8 feet. 

Tbese figures are small, but fiiirly accordant. A reinvestigation, 
bowever, sbowed tbat tbe various calculatious did not agree in sbowing 
tbe same displacement at tbe same time. Tbis made tbe wbole result 
doubtful, so tbat Newcomb (in 1892, Marcb, Mou. Not. R. A. S.) remarked 
tbat "tbe observations sbowed beyond doubt tbere could be no inequal- 
ity of tbe kind looked for." 

It was wbile investigations of tbis kind, to determine tbe separation 
of tbe axis of rotation and axis of figure, were going on tbat Sir AVil- 
liam Tbomson (now Lord Kelvin) announced, at tbe congress of tbe 
Britisb Association at Glasgow iu 1874, tbat tbe meteorological i)be- 
nomena, tbe fall of rain and snow, tbe cbanges wbicb occur in tbe cir- 
culation of tbe air and of tbe sea waters, would modify a little tbe 
mecbanical constitution of tbe globe, and displace a little tbe axis of 
figure, i. e., tbe form of tbe eartb would be cbanged by tbe causes men- 
tioned, and so a new sbortest axis would be made. Tbe effect of tbis 
would be to produce a cbauge in tbe latitudes of places, evidently. He 
tbougbt tbat it migbt amount to 0.50", wbicb would correspond to a 
movement of tbe old axis (at tbe pole) of 50 feet on tbe eartb's surface. 
Sir William Tbomson did not i^ublisb bis calculation, but tbe autbority 
of tbe great Englisb matbematician and pbysicist was sucb as to make 
scientific men give tbe statement great attention. Tbese meteorologic 
pbenomenaof wbicb Sir William Tbomson spoke are annual in cbarac- 
ter. Wben tbis annual period is combined witb tbe 305-day or ten- 
montb period of Euler we see tbat complexity results. Tbis was tbe 
state of tbe investigation wben Dr. Kiistner, of tbe Berlin Observatory, 
publisbed tbe results of bis observations made in 1884-85. Dr. Kiist- 
ner undertook some observations for tbe trial of a new metbod for tbe 
determination of tbe constant of aberration. On reducing bis obser- 
vations be obtained results wbicb were not at all satisfactory. A care- 
ful examination of bis work led bim to make tbe announcement tbat 
tbe unsatisfactory value for tbe aberration constant was due to a com- 
paratively rapid, tbougb very small, cbange in tbe latitude of tbe Berlin 
Observatory — " tbat from August to November, 1884, tbe latitude of 
Berlin bad been from 0.2" to 0.3" greater tban from Marcb to May in 
1884 and 1885." 

Tbis would indicate tbat from August to November, 1884, tbe i»ole of 
tbe eartb bad approacbed Berlin more closely by 20 to 30 feet tban in 
tbe time from Marcb to May. 

Tbis conclusion was fortified by tbe examination of otber data, 
obtained from tbe observatious made at Pulkova by Nyren. 



VARIATION OF LATITUDE. 277 

Here, tben, was evidence of a comparatively rapid cliange in lati- 
tude. New observations were undertaken at Berlin, Potsdam, Prague, 
and Bethlehem, Pa. (all by Talcott's method), and all agreed in show- 
ing plus and minus changes in latitude for the years 1888-1800. 

There were still some doubters. Moreover, it was decided to crit- 
ically test the matter by sending an exj)edition to the Sandwich 
Islands, which is 180 degrees (nearly) in longitude from Berlin. If it 
were known the latitude of Berlin increased, then a point in the 
Northern Hemisphere 180 degrees away from Berlin should simulta- 
neously show a decrease in latitude, for if the pole move toward Berlin 
it must move from the point on the other side of the earth. 

Our own Government joined in the effort. Marcuse, of Berlin, and 
Preston, of Washington, spent more than a year on the Sandwich 
Islands observing for latitude, while at the same time observations 
were continued at Berlin, Prague, and Strasburg in Europe, and at 
Eockville, Bethlehem, and San Francisco in the United States. The 
results of all these observations have been published, and show, with- 
out a chance of error, that the earth's axis is moving, that the lati- 
tudes at the Sandwich Islands increased when the latitudes in 
Germany diminished, and vice versa. 

The law of the change was eagerly and industriously sought for by 
some of the ablest mathematical astronomers of the world. They 
first worked on the idea that the changes must conform to the 30o-day 
period of Euler, combined with an annual change due to causes set 
forth by Sir William Thomson, and which I have previously mentioned. 
None of these investigations have given a satisfactory formula for the 
prediction of the latitude of any place. 

In 1891 Dr. S. C. Chandler, of Cambridge, Mass., began his investi- 
gation of the problem. He remarks: 

"I deliberately put aside all teaching of theory, because it seemed to 
me high time that the facts should be examined by a purely inductive 
process ; that the nugatory results of all attempts to detect the existence 
of the Eulerian period (of 305 days) probably arose from a defect of 
the theory itself, and that the entangled condition of the whole subject 
required that it should be examined afresh by processes unfettered by 
any preconceived notions whatever. The problem which I therefore 
proposed to myself was to see whether it would not be possible to lay 
the numerous ghosts in the shape of various discordant, residual phe- 
nomena pertaining to deteruiinationsof aberration, parallaxes, latitudes, 
and the like, which have heretofore flitted elusively about the astronomy 
of precision during the century, or to reduce them to some tangible form 
by some simple consistent hypothesis. It was thought that if this could 
be done a study of the nature of the forces as thus indicated, by which 
the earth's rotation is influenced, might tend to a physical exj)lauation 
of them." 

Dr. Chandler proceeded to examine his own work with the Almucan- 
tar at Cambridge, the observations of Klistner, Gylden Nyren, the 
Washington observations, and others. He found that they all seemed 



278 VARIATION OF LATITUDE. 

to indicate that the pole of the rotation axis was moving from west to 
east about the axis of figure of the earth in a iieriod of 427 days. 
Other observations did not seem to confirm this period. Finally he 
made an elaborate analysis of 33,000 observations between 1837 and 
1891, and the result was an empirical law which can be announced as 
follows : 

The pole of the rotation axis of the earth moved with its greatest 
velocity about the pole of the axis of figure about the year 1774; the 
period then was 348 days. The velocity has diminislied with an accel- 
erated rate since then. In 1890 the period was 443 days. The distance 
of one pole from the other was about 22 feet, equal to 0.22". 

Further elaborate examination of this material developed the exceed- 
ingly important and interesting result that the changes in latitude 
were the sum of two periodic fluctuations superposed on. each other. 
One had a period of about 427 days and an amplitude of 0.12"; the 
second had a period of a year, with an amplitude that was variable 
between 0.04" and 0.20". 

Sometimes these two fluctuations worked together, giving a total 
range of 0.33", and at times they conspired against each other, reduc- 
ing the range to a mininuim of a few hundredths of a second. He 
compared his theory with the observations, and the result was, in the 
main, exceedingly satisfactory. 

His conclusions were attacked as to the 427-day term. The annual 
term could be explained as due to meteorologic causes. 

Professor New comb, however, in March, 1892, explained, in a paper 
communicated to the Monthly Notices of the Eoyal Astronomical 
Society, that in deducting the Eulerian i)eriod of 305 days the earth, as 
we have remarked, was considered absolutely rigid; that- when the 
eflect of the mobility of the oceans and of the lack of perfect rigidity 
of the earth were taken into account, the mathematics reijuired a time 
of rotation of the true pole about the axis of figure longer than the 
previously accepted 305 days. Making certain assumptions, Newcomb 
obtained a period of 443 daj'S.' 

An additional interesting conclusion which Dr. Chandler has lately 
jmblished is that the fluctuation with a period of 427-428 days is a cir- 
cular one, as theory seems to demand, while the annual fiuetuations 
appear elliptical in character. 

An exceedingly interesting and important confirmation of the Chand- 
lerian i>eriod of 427 days, or about 14 months, was lately announced by 
M. Tisserand. Examination has been made of the tide records of the 
Helder in Holland. These are kept with great accuracy. It has been 
found that between 1851 and 1893 these tide records show a variation 
in the average sea level indicating a 14-month period. The greatest 

'Prof. R. S. Woodward has lately obtained, by a new discussion of the theoretical 
l>roblem, a formula that seems to indicate the correctness of Chandler's empirical 
formula.

divergencies are very small, ouly 14 millimeters, equal to one-half 
iucb about, but tbey appear unmistakably and are what theory would 

demand. _ , ^ ^ ., ^ i 

In a letter, recently received from Dr. Chandler, he states that he 
finds that the annual part of the polar motion is an ellipse three or four 
times as long as broad, and he expresses the law of the motion of the 
pole in this ellipse as that the areas described from the center are pro- 
portional to the times. . . ^.^ i 

We can conclude safely, therefore, that no large changes of latitude 
have taken place for many thousands of years; in fact, m geologic 
times that there is no adequate proof of progressive changes in the 
latitude of any place ; but, finally, that very small periodic changes have 
occurred, and they are ^uch as can be and are observed. 

Tlie feeling is growing in the minds of those who have given the sub- 
ject close attention that we shall find that many and various causes 
enter into the problem of determiniug the law of changes. It wdl no 
doubt take many years of careful observation to obtain the data neces- 
sary to fully test Dr. Chandler's, or any other hypothesis. 

The scientific men abroad are discussing the advisability of estab- 
lishing several observatories at various places on the earth's surface 
for the purpose of collecting the data. 

Ultimately Dr. Chandler's formula, or a slight modification of it, may 
be proved correct, and with it we may be able to state what the lati- 
tude of any place will be at auy time. 

The lecture was followed by some illustrations showing that revolving 
bodies preferred to revolve about their shortest axis or around the axis 
about which the moment of inertia was a maximum. 

Charts and diagrams were exhibited showing the results of obser- 
vations made at Pulkova, Prague, Berlin, Strasburg, Bethlehem, the 
Sandwich Islands, etc. 

These results were compared with the deductions from Chandler s 
formula and shown to agree therewith to a remarkable extent. 

The preliminary results of the observations made at Columbia- Col- 
lege from May, 1893, to July, 1891, were exhibited. 

The lecturer threw on the screen illustrations of several forms ot 
zenith telescopes, and described the new form made by Wanschafl, of 
Berlin. 



THE DEVELOPMENT OP THE CARTOGEAPHY OF AMERICA 
UP TO THE YEAR 1570.i 



By Dr. Sophus Ruge. 



The discovery of America and the geographical researches on that 
continent may be regarded as the initial period of the era of discovery. 
In order to intelligently trace the gradual dawning of a new world 
upon the geographical chart and, at the same time, to comi^are the 
discoveries made by the several pilots and to estimate briefly their 
value from a scientific point of view, I have selected the medium of a 
collection of thirty- two maps, upon which are represented the progress 
of discovery from decade to decade. 

This cartographical evolution ends with the year 1570, for in that 
year first appeared Ortelius's Theatrum Orbis, the earliest modern 
atlas, by which, in numerous editions and in various languages, we 
have an easily accessible collection of new charts. Previous to that 
publication, exclusive of the rare collection of Lafreris, the maps of the 
several engravers, through successive years combined, were printed 
only in single sheets or introduced as such in scientific works of the 
most dissimilar character. 

The present maps contain four series of illustrations. The first series 
(Pis. XVII-XX) exhibits, on modern charts, the coasts and inland 
regions that have been discovered. The second series (Pis. XXI- 
XXIV) presents to our view the results of the observations of the pilots 
to whom we are indebted for the production of these maps. 

Xaturally, with the excei)tiou of the Oosa chart, no original surveys 
could be rex)resented, bat they are, on the contrary, copies and tran 
scripts of copies which are extant, a compilation gathered from different

the jiew, relatively to tlie known world. Here the originals are, almost 
without exception, modified typographically, and they are either wood- 
cuts or cojtper engravings. Copies, however, are introduced of manu- 
scripts and of iiainted globes. Where single charts, simply marine 
charts, have been struck off, which, however, but seldom occurs, they 
are given uncolored and without doctrinal reasoning or scientific signifi- 
cance. For the information of the scholar, which it was necessary to 
express in the third or fourth series, two series were requisite, partly 
iu order to give an indication of the abundance of the theories, that 
often changed as suddenly as they arose, and partly with a view to intro- 
duce into this history all prominent or representative names. 

In order to subjoin to the discoveries as well as to the charts the 
necessary explanations, inasmuch as they could only be given curso- 
rily and summarily in a map, the second and sjjecial part of this paper 
comprises a history of the voyages of discovery and exploration, and the 
necessary material for charts, all of which is chronologically arranged.^ 
The important points in a history of discoveries are not alone to clearly 
set forth the more prominent incidents of the earlier voyages, and esj^e- 
cially those of Colon, as also the names given to the discovered local- 
ities, but likewise to give the sources of evidence, and opportunely, 
works of critical research. In the course of the sixteenth century the 
more real discoveries cease, and the more brief, generally speaking, are 
communications and critical observations. The chronological series ol 
charts that are accessible, in so far as they are geographical, possess a 
certain value and are given with the utmost completeness possible. 
Among them the principal works of Ilarrisse offer the most valid claims 
to our recognition. I confidently believe that although this series is far 
from being exhaustive, it will nevertheless be acceptable to those who 
are interested in the too-little-cultivated history of cartography. The 
works, too, are cited, as far as known to me, in which the respective 
charts are to be found, either in facsimile or imitation. 

For a critical analysis and appreciation of the charts themselves, and 
an understanding of their relation one to another, synoptical tables of 
all the names and legends were requisite, the laborious preparation of 
which may not appear in a brief statement, but the value of which 
may be recognized from the few critical observations upon them. 

In the third series, charts 1 and 2 revert to a i)eriod anterior even to 
the discovery of America by Columbus, in 1402. These are shown for 
the purpose of giving expression to ideas and theories on the lines of 
demarcation of countries which have had decided influence on poster- 
ity, such, for example as the Zamoiski codex of 14G8 for Northern, and 
Behaim's Globus of 1492, for Eastern Asia. The questionable Zeno

cliart of 1380 (?) is included in the appended list,i for the reason that 
after its publication in tlie year 1558, not merely did the Italian Ptole- 
milus editions, but even Mercator, as well, follow its deUneation of the 
northern regions. 

THE jMARTNE charts. 

The art of designing marine charts originated with the Italians. 
When the Portuguese Prince Henry began his discoveries he sought 
to obtain Italians for his enterprises. So likewise in chart design, or 
drafts, Itahans became the instructors of the Portuguese, and with the 
latter the Basques appeared, as skillful mariners and cartographers. 
Not until toward the middle of the sixteenth century did nautical car- 
tography find its entrance into France. It did not reach either Eng- 
land or Germany at the epoch of the great discoveries. But in Spain, 
to which is due the most ancient cartography of the most important 
regions in America, guidance and enlightenment were derived from 
Italians, Basques, and Portuguese. And thus the material for Ameri- 
can cartography consists of Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and more 
recently of French charts, or coast pilots. The language of these charts 
is exclusively Romanish. 

But, unfortunately, original drafts are hardly accessible. Unfortu- 
nately, also, most of the track charts no longer exist. "What, in the 
lapse of time, has been preserved from shipwreck, or the hands of the 
gold-beaters, is as yet not fully ascertained, and very little indeed has 
been described" (Harrisse, Cabot, p. 130). As often as pictures of the 
uprising New World vary in the first decades, just so often do the charts 
become antiquated and dangerous as guides. It therefore became 
necessary from considerations of prudence or utility to discard or 
destroy the more ancient. Thus it happens that neither in Spain nor 
in Portugal is there to be found a chart of America for the first fifteen 
years of the sixteenth century, with the exception of that oldest map 
of the world, which was recovered from France, and on which the New 
World is represented— the noted chart of the Basque pilot Juan de 
la Cosa. The earliest charts that have been preserved, next to that of 
Cosa, the marine charts of Canario and Cantero, and that of Kunst- 
mann in his atlas of published sheets, Nos. 2 and 3, are to be found in 
the collections of Italy, France, and Germany. And even these, col- 
lectively, are no longer original, but imitations and compilations 
collectetl from various State archives. And although Cosa, in the 
delineation of America, has pronounced his work as original, his chart 
upon the whole is merely a compilation. 

The elaborate, and in many respects incisive criticism which Har- 
risse- above all others, has devoted to the subject, has enabled us, in

284 DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTOGRAPHY OF AMERICA. 

special instances to determine what originals were used in drawing 
some of the chart copies, but it is impossible to say how far original 
and copy agree with each other. So, also, the oldest manuscripts for 
a cartographic history of America are not originals, but merely arbi- 
trary combinations of various copies, not drawn from originals of 
equivalent value, for the value of a first impression on the mind is 
always dependent upon the intelligence of the pilot. Every copyist 
is subjected to the risk of committing errors, through a misappre- 
hension, or perhaps through careless haste. And here no connected 
text is employed, as in the transcript of a literary composition, but 
individual names without connection or correlation are strung along, 
like beads, upon the water line of a seacoast. Cosmographers, too, 
avail themselves in numerous instances of abbreviations in favor at 
the time, and employed in manuscripts. The i)oints designated along 
the coast are in some localities so crowded together that errors may 
readily occur in their repetition, not alone through the misinterpreta- 
tion of a name badly or illegibly written, but in some cases from its 
entire omission. And thus the correct reduplication of a series of 
appellations, so closely written, would be rendered almost imjiracti- 
cable. Besides, if copperplates or woodcuts were designed for charts 
written upon parchment, the brittle character of the material on which 
it must be printed would doubtless make necessary a reduction in the 
number of the local names. It could not be assumed, moreover, tluit 
due discrimination had been exercised in the topography of these 
sheets, and only the less unimportant particulars omitted. 

The principal share in the explorations made along the American 
seacoast unquestionably belongs to the Spanish pilots, or to those 
employed in the service of Spain. But it must in no wise be supposed 
from this that Spanish influence in the development of the cartography 
of America has been very considerable. The reverse, indeed, is the 
case. Spanish cartography, it is true, begins immediately after the 
first voyage of Colon, and innumerable traces in the literature of the 
country, and the nmnuscripts contained in their archives, afford ample 
evidence of the rapid development among them of the art of sketching 
and designing marine charts. But desjute this fact, the dissemination 
of this art throughout Spain, and its progress toward northern regions, 
and consequent intluence upon the cartographic conceptions of middle 
Europe during the first quarter of the sixteenth century, can not be 
established. Columbus had jiromised to draw up a chart of the dis- 
coveries of his first voyage, and lie had held out to their majesties an 
assurance of its execution on his return home. On the 5th of Septem- 
ber, 14:93, he was again reminded of his engagement by Queen Isabella 
(Navarr. II., p. 122., 2d edition, 1859). Meanwhde the court records 
communicate nothing to us, in respect either to the dispatch of the 
chart or its receipt. It is proved in several ways that a chart of his 
third voyage was in existence. Hojeda saw it first at Bishop Fon- 



DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTOGRAPHY OF AMERICA. 285 

seca's, and obtained a copy of the chart for his own first voyage (ISTavarr. 
Ill, pp. 539, 586). But of all his charts, not one has been preserved. 

The restored chart of Juan de laCosa, 1500, is, then, the earliest car- 
tographic memorial handed down to us; and in this map the skillful 
Basque mariner has combined in one exhibit the various Spanish dis- 
coveries, and, possibly also, the discoveries of John Cabot in North 
America. 

The incidents of the fourth voyage of the Admiral in 1502-1504 were 
rapidly disseminated throughout Europe, for not only Columbus him- 
self and his brother Bartholomew, but likewise the other mariners had 
each designed charts. It might therefore be readily inferred that not 
merely facts but names themselves might vary in many important i)ar- 
ticulars. Charts were no mystery, and they might be indiscriminately 
reproduced, or even acquired by purchase. In Portugal there was a 
chart industry, and there was an open traffic in them under the restric- 
tion, however, that it was forbidden, under a heavy penalty, to draw 
plans of the route by sea to the Molucca Islands. We thus find that 
later on an Italian draftsman, Baptista Agnese, contributed, as a sup- 
plement to his finely executed collection of maps, a chart of the world, 
upon which the Molucca route was clearly traced, and it was recognized 
as such. 

When, in 1500, the Portuguese Indian fleet under Cabral discovered 
Brazil, and when in succeeding years Portuguese vessels had coasted 
along a considerable portion of the eastern coast of South America, it 
appears that in Portugal they encouraged the publication of these 
facts. This was naturally in the highest degree obnoxious to the 
Spaniards, for at Lisbon copies of the charts were willingly accorded 
to Italians. It appears further that charts of Cabot's voyages were 
brought to Lisbon earlier than to Spain. At all events, the explora- 
tions of Cortoreal and the earliest received charts of Cantino and 
Canario had their origin in Portugal. To a wide diflusion of the 
incidents of his own voyages in Portuguese ships, Vespucci himself 
contributed, as they were accustomed to say, through picture and nar- 
rative; and thus the influence of Portuguese charts, copied by Italians, 
upon the ideas of Middle Europe was already inaugurated before 
Spanish cartography was directed intO' regular channels. The first 
foundation for the system was laid in the establishment of the Indian 
office at Seville in 1503. The lead in all transmarine enterprises 
emanated from the Casa de Contrataciou for the Indies. Here were 
necessarily collected charts of all recent discoveries. But it would 
necessarily soon become evident that such charts, based upon charts 
often widely deviating from each other and giving imperfect or errone- 
ous delineations of the coasts in the new hemisphere, would rather 
expose mariners to danger than aftbrd them security. It became nec- 
essary, therefore, to exercise a many-sided critique and careful investi- 
gation of the charts accessible, and care be taken that seamen were

furuished with tlie most accurate maps obtainable aud designed upon 
uniform principles. 

The progress here .indicated was associated with the nomination of 
Amerigo Vespucci in 1508 to be chief pilot in Spain. The plan was 
then first conceived of drawing under his supervision an official gen- 
eral map of the regions discovered (Navarr. Ill, p. 300). Juan Diaz 
de Solis and Vinceucio Yanez Piuzon were associated with him. Of all 
the charts then in existence that of Andres de Morales was declared 
to be the best, and it was raised to the grade of an official chart, or 
royal j)adrou. No mariner was permitted to have on board his ship, 
under a penalty of 50 doubloons ($240), any other chart. But it was 
more easy to issue than to enforce such an order. 

When Amerigo Vespucci died, on the 22d of February, 1512, Diaz 
de Solis succeeded him as chief pilot. In the same year, the latter, 
together with the nephew of Amerigo, Juan Vespucci, received a com- 
mission to draw up an official chart. In consideration of this they 
were each to receive the privilege of copying and selling the royal 
padron. But other cartographers did not trouble themselves about 
this i)rivilege. During subsequent years, and up to the i^eriod of Diaz 
de Solis's death, we are informed of several convocations of a junta 
through which the preparation of an official chart might be expedited, 
but it seems that many impediments were encountered in its execution. 
And, in fact, no trace has been preserved of any similarly authorized 
charts. The question here was an exact determination of the longitude 
of Cai)e St. Augustine, in Brazil, iiccording to which it was hoped that 
the line of demarcation of the Portuguese claims in South America 
might be definitely adjusted, for the Portuguese were determined to 
imprison every Spaniard who overstepped the boundary. Incorrect 
charts, moreover, exposed seamen to imminent peril in that locality. 

It has been supposed that Sheets IV and V in Kunstmann's Atlas 
were promulgated as results of the junta of 1515 (Kohl, Generalkar- 
ten, J). 30), for these charts must have appeared subsequent to 1513, 
inasmuch as Balboa's South Sea is indicated upon them. But these 
two charts represent two different standpoints. No. IV represents 
the Portuguese claim in Brazil as proved by the line of demarcation 
through that country and the long legend upon the Portuguese side, 
while No. V defends Spanish pretensions, according to which the 
boundary line recognizes as valid, in behalf of the claims of Portagal, 
only the extreme projection of Brazil. The first chart employs the 
medium of the Portuguese tongue : the second of the Italian. The 
uncertainty as to a comprehensive idea of the new regions lasted only 
a few years; that is to say, until the shores of the Mexican Gulf were 
taken up by Pincdo or until Sebastian d'Elcano, of Magellan's squad- 
ron, brought home the earliest charts of the southern extremity of 
South America. Moreover, not until about 1522 «r 1523 was the Span- 
ish coast line in America fully determined in the west, through their 



DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTOGRAPHY OF AMERICA. 287 

researches on the broad ocean, as furnished by the surveys of Cortez 
and Pizarro. And now the idea of a universal official map or "padron" 
was ouce more reverted to. 

In the year 1526 Ferdinand Columbus received an order to prepare 
an accurate chart, and this, by a later imperial decree, was to be 
entitled the "general padron." But when, after the lapse of nine 
years, a reiterated command was dispatched to the son of the Admiral 
to complete the work, it must not be concluded that up to that period 
he had not executed the commission or supplied any map whatever. 
Nor does this entirely justify the assumption that the Weimaraner 
general chart of 1527, the first general map, originated with him. The 
second, designed by Ribero, and the general map of 1527, and that of 
1529, essentially altered, have both likewise been preserved. The 
approved type exhibited in each of these charts was henceforth as a 
general rule steadily adhered to. 

Though the Portuguese occupy a subordinate rank as regards the 
extent of their contributions to the cartography of America, the dis- 
tinction is assuredly due them of having first conceived and portrayed 
the continent of Korth America in its correct and pro^jer contour, 
exclusive, of course, of the x)olar regions. They were able pilots and 
expert draftsmen, and not only by their labors, but by their methods, 
they have exercised a vast influence, especially upon geographical 
works in German5^ Many of their pilots and draftsmen emigrated 
secretly from Portugal into Spain and entered into the service of 
Charles V. Such, for example, were Francisco and Euy Faliero, Jorge 
and Pedro Eeinel, and Simon de Alcazaba de Sotomayor. Along with 
these, and even to a greater extent than the latter, Italians emigrated 
to Spain. Only Columbus, however, with Amerigo and Juan Vespucci, 
are here mentioned (Harrisse, Cabot, p. 219). Two of the earliest and 
most important cartographic records, the charts of Cantino and Cane- 
rio, although supplied or drawn by Italians, are copies of Portuguese 
originals. Both of these, as also the surveys of the coasts of the New 
World sent to the Duke Rene of Lothringen, had a far-reaching influ- 
ence upon scientific cosmography. 

This influence, however, emanates from Italians residing abroad. 
Harrisse calls attention to the fact (Discovery of North America, 
p. 270) that cartographers living in Italy only recently, comparatively, 
took notice of the discoveries of Spaniards and Portuguese in the New 
World, and with the exception of Johann Ruysch, a German, who copied 
in its essential details a Portuguese map of the New World for the 
Roman Ptolemiius of 1508, the Viscount di Maggiolo was the first who 
brought to Naples a representation of the newly discovered regions, in 
1511. Cartographic activity in Italy, up to the year 1527, remained 
dependent upon Portuguese exemplars. Spanish influence is first 
detected in Maggiolo'a chart of 1527. The French took part in these 
nautical and cartographic enterprises much later than the three south-

erii Eouiaiiish nations — the Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. Here, 
too, an Italian, Giov. Verrazzano, in 1524, was the i^ioneer. The voy- 
age of the first Frenchman, Jacques Cartier, followed ten years later, 
and altlioiigii none of his original drawings have been preserved, the 
results of his first voyages of discovery shown upon the chart of the 
world by Nicolas Deslien of Dieppe, 1541, constitute the oldest French 
cartographic publications known to us. The latter is preserved in the 
Eoyal Library at Dresden. 

But it was no longer possible for French cartography to exert a 
decided influence; on the contrary, their cosmographers showed them- 
selves dependent, in many respects, upon Germany. The earliest 
marine chart, in a modern sense, in nautical use, the celebrated map 
of the world by Mercator, appeared in 1569, and consequently at the 
close of the period here under discussion. The uncertainty which pre- 
vailed for a decade in the delineation of the newly discovered coasts 
was chiefly due to inexact astronomical calculations. Calculations of 
latitude were naturally more easily determined than those of longi- 
tude. And when it is remarked that in the middle of the Kew World 
and in West Indian waters, where alone the Spaniard was enterpris- 
ing, vacillation prevailed longest, while north and south, in New- 
foundland and Brazil, whither in the same year, 1500, came Portuguese 
vessels, long before the geographical latitude was clearly determined, 
we necessarily reach the conclusion that the Portuguese were greatly 
in advance of the Spaniards in their nautical skill and ability. 

Columbus himself did not rise above the companions of his voyages 
in knowledge and address. Information which comes to us, second- 
hand, of his observations of latitude betrays a vacillation and hesi- 
tancy between his own tendencies and the chart of Toscanelli, which 
he blindly followed. H. Harrisse in his latest work (Discovery of 
North America, p. 401), adopts, however, the conclusion of Humboldt, 
that Columbus did not have on board a chart of Toscanelli, for he 
would otherwise have crossed the ocean under the parallel of Lisbon. 
I consider, however, this assumption as untenable, for the rich terri- 
tories of Eastern Asia, the goal of his western voyages, must first be 
sought in the torrid zone, or in the vicinity of that zone; and it is ques- 
tionable whether it would not have been more advisable to navigate 
seas that were known, those for example, from Spain to the Canaries, 
on the borders of the Tropics, than to seek a fresh route thither on the 
unknown waters of Eastern Asia. In the second place, according to 
the chart, as may be seen on Behaim's copy, two very desirable anchor- 
ages were to be anticipated at Antilia and Zipangu, on the western 
route, from the Canaries to Zayton, under rather similar conditions, 
whereby a sea voyage of indefinite length was broken in a very wel- 
come manner. In the third place, it is manifest from the daybook of 
the Admiral that he hoped to reach these points. Antilia he desired to 
visit upon his return voyage, since he did not find it precisely where he 



DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTOGRAPHY OF AMERICA. 289 

supposed from his chart he ought to have found it, aud Zipangu he 
believed he had discovered ou reaching Haiti. All the observations 
of the discoverer respecting his ideas of the division of land and water 
are intelligible through this chart. And lastly, due weight should be 
given to the highly important testimony of Bishop Las Casas, which, 
in view of its manifold repetitions, should not be treated as a common 
error, as is sometimes the case with his statements. 

Las Casas (Lib. I, chap. 12, Bd. I, p. 96) having referred to the geo- 
graphical error of Toscanelli, through which, in a western voyage, the 
territories of the " Grosschans" were first touched upon (remarks which, 
in an abbreviated form and in part also verbally, are again met with 
in the histories, Chap. VIII') the Bishop adds some significant para- 
graphs to this, which are omitted in the histories, being somewhat 
equivocal as affecting the reputation of the Genoese: "La carta de 
marear (Toscanelli) que le invio, yo, que esta historia escribo, tengo en 
mi jjoder, y della se hara mds mencion abajo." (The marine chart which 
1 sent to him, I, who am writing this history, hold in my custody, and 
about which further mention will be made below.) And a few lines 
farther on he adds: "Y ansi creo que todo su viaje sobre esta carta 
fundo." (I believe also that his [Columbus's] entire voyage was based 
upon this chart.) Then Las Casas again returns to the chart in his 
narrative of the first passage across the ocean, when Columbus, on Sep- 
tember 25, 1492, Avithheld the marine chart of Martin Alfonso Pinzon, 
while borne onward upon the ocean waters which they were then navi- 
gating. It was a question of the precise situation of Antilia. Here 
Las Casas remarks, in chapter 38 (p. 279) : "Esta carta es la, que envio 
Paulo, fisico, el Florentin, la cual tengo en mi poder." (This is the chart 
which the Florentine physician [Toscanelli] sent, whom I hold in my 
power.) Toscanelli's chart was held in high estimation by Columbus. 
Of this there can exist no doubt, for no other chart was obtainable that 
exhibited the entire ocean as far as the coast of Asia. He must have 
had the Toscanelli chart on board, for he could have guided himself by 
none other, and he piloted his course solely by this chart. 

The uncertainty of the latitudes, which I ascribe to the influence of 
Toscanelli, can even be recognized in a chart handed down from very 
early times. It is Table II in Kunstmann's Atlas. Here the shores 
of the Greater Antilles extend from Puerto Eico to Cuba, and directly 
onward to the northwest, so that the northwestern extremity of Cuba 
reaches the fiftieth i)arallel of latitude. Such errors disappear grad- 
ually, and not until after the death of Colon, and by degrees only, 
does the tropical circle assume its i^roi^er position relatively to the 
Greater Antilles. The correct delineation of the chart does not come 
to us until it is first exhibited in the general map of 1527. On the 
other hand, the mouth of the Amazon was correctly placed, from the

and the one upon which the historians have drawn.

290 DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTOGRAPHY OF AMERICA. 

first, under the equator. The eastern projection of Brazil, Cape St. 
Augustine, appears early in its proper situation. Far more difficult 
than the latitude was the determination of the longitude. They could 
not then reckon astronomically. It was much easier to ascertain the 
dangerous character of the coast through an estimate of the rapidity 
of the passage. But that even here opinions differed may be per- 
ceived from the varying estimates of pilots on the occasion of the first 
voyage of Colon. His own observations or calculations of latitude are 
no better than those of hi& contemporaries. Nor do 1 believe that the 
few astronomical efforts that were made to determine the longitude on 
American soil have had any inlluence upon the maps. It is therefore 
not to be wondered at that the eastern shores of the New World, 
namely, South and Central America, should be removed 3 to 5 degrees 
too far toward the east. Things were even in a worse state in the 
beginning in the case of North America. The insular-like appearance 
of the shores of Newfoundland, Labrador, and Greenland (?) scarcely 
permit us, at first, to devine their actnal character. The eastern coast 
of the present United States was quite delusive, extending horizontally 
from west to east, as if the ocean were quite dammed off on the north. 
As a necessary sequence, Newfoundland lay about 40 degrees too far 
to the east. These errors had undergone hardly any correction during 
the sixteenth century. 

The line of demarcation, decided upon since 1494, frequently served 
on the general charts as an initial meridian. We first meet with it on 
Sheet IV, in Kuustmann's Atlas, and consequently somewhere about 
the year 1518. It here lies 21 to 22 degrees westward from the Cape 
Verde Island Santo Antonio, and hence 370 leagues remote from it, as 
was settled in the convention of Tordesillas in 1494. liut Spanish 
cosmographers wished to remove it as far as possible to the east, in 
order to lessen the domains of Portugal. They were unable to come 
to a full settlement of this point. The old charts, whether of land or 
sea, track charts, or maps multiplied by typography, could alone supply 
a scientific desideratum where the date of restoration is clearly indi- 
cated by the compiler, and when, moreov^er, an exact computation of 
the time is made, or where this date may be ascertained with reasonable 
probability from the text. The greater portion of the old cartographic 
records that have been x)reserved are without date. 

Of the twelve oldest sheets that we possess from the year 1500 to 
1509, four are dated and eight are without date. We may regard it as 
a great piece of good fortune that the oldest chart of Juan de la Cosa 
that has been preserved bears a precise date, and that to the so-called 
Cantino chart a definite year may be ascribed with confidence through 
the letter that accompanies it. In other cases a determination of the 
time of a chart without date is always an extremely difficult problem. 

It is true that in many instances it is possible to verify Avliich are the 
most recent discoveries recorded, but it follows necessarily from this 



DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTOGRAPHY OF AMERICA. 291 

thut the chart could not have been delineated previous to the fact of 
its discovery. Ou the other hand, it can not be perceived after how 
long a space of time later on the cartographer executed the draft. If 
no one of the cartographers who were residing In Italy prior to 1508, 
or, more correctly speaking, anterior to loll, take any note of America, 
such a fact should only counsel the exercise of extreme caution. 

Inasmuch as with but few exceptions none of the original drafts 
have descended to us from remote times, and since the labors of suc- 
cessive pilots have been collected, for various years, into one general 
map, tlie difficulty of ascertaining the exact dates has been greatly 
increased. And yet, in the case of the port entry records, which were 
made up in the seaport towns, it is more easily established than through 
the sheets subsequently printed. The execution or engraving of the 
sheets required considerable time, the printing was often retarded a 
year or more, and all this must be weighed with the possibility that 
the latest designs were not always at the disposal of the scientist from 
whom these charts emanated. It thus happens that such sheets, with- 
out any date, were begun too i>rematurely. It is well ascertained that 
designs for the PtolemJius charts (Strasburg, 1503) were six years at 
least in the hands of the college authorities at St. Die before they were 
issued. And, moreover, Duke Eenatus (deceased in 1508) had come 
into possession of the new marine charts of South America and South 
Africa, which, at a later period, are said to have embellished the 
Ptolemitus editions, although only in woodcut; and Martin Waldsee- 
miiller announced, in 1507, in a letter to Amerbach, St. Die, of the 5th 
of April, that the charts would very soon appear in print. 

The first known globe executed by Nordenskjold presents another 
illustration of this (facsimile atlas. Table XXXVIII). The origin of 
this globe, Nordenskjold thinks, may be traced to the years 1510 to 
1515, while Harrisse has proven by an inscription discovered in Haiti 
that we should not assign a date earlier than 1518 to the appearance of 
the globe. 

In the same way the date of a chart of the world, designed by Des- 
calier, the so-called chart of Henry II, was antedated by a year, until 
the inscription with the date itself was discovered upon the original. 
If, in the catalogue ^ of known charts, the figures of the year, in the 
case of charts without date, are definitely or api>roximately given, these 
figures should always be received with reserve, though I have always 
endeavored to follow only the most approved authorities. 

In the study of marine charts another difficulty arises, where it is a 
question of identification or determination definitely of the old names 
and reconciling them with the existing local appellations, for only a 
portion of the names given by the discoverers themselves have been 
retained up to the present time. Many of them likewise have been 
modified, mutilated, or supplanted by other appellations even during

the lifetime of their sponsors. The Spaniards ignored the distinctions 
of the Portuguese, and vice versa. Nay, more than this, of one a,nd 
the same marine expedition varying or widely differing charts might 
be brought home by diiferent pilots, and if upon these originals the 
names were abbreviated or illegibly written not inconsiderable discrep- 
ancies would necessarily arise in the first copies. The interpretation 
of the names, moreover, is fraught with the difficulty that discoverers 
have rarely given an exact description of the coasts in their written 
reports, for only very seldom indeed, as in the case of Columbus, are the 
ships' logbooks or even an epitome of them accessible. The reports, 
also, are not infrequently too vaguely or generally recorded — as, for 
example, in the four voyages of the two Vespuccis — to afford any medium 
for their correct interpretation. The description of the localities also 
often presents wide divergencies. As tlie signification or correct iiiter- 
l^retation of the local names is often obscure or unintelligible, it is 
natural that to fresh inquiries an elucidation of these details is often 
embarrassing. 

According to H. A. Schumacher's communication (Kohl's American 
Studies, in the German geographical sheets, Bd. XI, p. 100, Bremen, 
1888), J. (1. Kohl writes concerning the old charts, in which he had for 
years earnestly interested himself: " One is to be cautioned against a 
too indiscriminate use of these things. As a matter of course the 
charts assume to give a correct representation of the countries in their 
more prominent features, as the author proposes to himself at the 
moment of their execution; but the operation of delineating charts, 
which should properly have been the work of only cultivated and 
learned minds, was often confided to very inexperienced hands, and was 
conducted in part in an extremely negligent manner, while the draft 
of a chart, correct in all its details, presupposes so extraordinary a 
mass of information, that it was impossible to meet all its requirements 
until in more recent times; and not until in more recent times was all 
this knowledge combined and attainable in due form." 

Now all this may be readily conceded, and yet we are constrained, 
where it is a question of the development of cartograi^hy, as in the 
case of America, to consult and investigate closely the most insignifi- 
cant sheet, and we must at all events endeavor to obtain a clear eluci- 
dation of each of the names. But unfortunately it is hardly practicable 
to determine with confidence, in the case of many of the imi)ortant 
voyages of discovery — as, for example, those of B. Gomez, AyUons (in 
spite of the Spanish chart of a Eibero) — what points of the coast are 
indicated under the old designations, or in what locality a landing, or 
possibly a settlement, has been effected. 

If not for the determination of the local names, at all events for that 
of the dates of discovery, the saints of the Catholic Church are of 
great utility. The day of the discovery is hereby conclusively estab- 
lished, and in accordance with this it may not infrequently be demon-

strated that a discovery sliould not be credited to a sea captain whose 
voyage harmonizes with the year but not with the month to which it is 
accredited.

ject to annex here an alphabetical list of the saintly names most fre-

Besides these saintly names, which for the most part fall upon their 
feast days, though occasionally on a proximate date, the nomenclature 
of the old maps consists only of characteristic symbols of the coasts 
visited and first taken possession of. The usual names are as follows:

Similar oeueral distinctions in reference to tlie character of the 
coast, singularly enougU, maybe found upon cliarts, engraved or wood- 
cut; that is to say, where they are true copies of marine charts. 

The woodcut is the most brittle of all the substances employed, but 
it came in use in all German charts. And here distortions of names 
most readily occur, as well as limitations in the manner of representing 
the prominent local features. The woodcuts fronting the marine 
charts are inferior and rough, and reflect only imperfectly the informa- 
tion obtained. Yet such a merely general index as bahia has become 
a symbol of recognition for a whole collection of maps. The well- 
known Bay of All Saints, on the coast of Brazil, was converted into 
Abatia of the Saints, through the general distortion of names, and 
afterwards into Abbey of all the Saints. It was in the German cos- 
mography, beginning with the Waldseemiiller charts of 1513, that the 
remarkable error first appeared, which was more widely spread by 
Schouer (Harrisse, Discovery of Xorth America, p. 275). 

THE TERRESTRIAL CHARTS AND GLOBES. 

It deserves to be particularly emphasized that in those countries to 
which we are chiefly indebted for discoveries in the New World, no 
cosmographic science existed; that in Spain and Portugal no globe has 
been iiroduced, and only very rarely has a woodcut come to light. 

What position the newly discovered islands — for of such the North 
American regions apparently consisted — and also what situation the 
great continent occupied on both sides of the equator relatively to all 
other parts of the known world; whether the new country was to be 
included with Asia in a broad signification, or whether connected with 
Asia at all; whether what is now called North and South America 
stand in any correlation to each other — all these questions were dis- 
cussed in (iermany and Italy, and more recently in France, but neither 
in Spain nor Portugal. Various opinions and doctrines in reference to 
these points arose and environed the gradual evolution of the new 
hemisphere. 

This first geographical development of scientific inquiry had gone 
forth from Italy with the resuscitation of the "Ptolemiius." German 
astronomers and mathematicians were once more seated at the feet of 
the ancient Alexandrine geograjjliers. For this reason the charts first 
printed are, almost without exception, closely allied with the rapidly 
succeeding editions of the Ptolemiius. In accuracy of drawing and 
copiousness of nomenclature, the Italian editions far exceeded the Ger- 
man, for here we find the copperplate. In Germany, on the other 



DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTOGRAPHY OF AMERICA. 295 

Land, the woodcut predominated in the restoration of the charts. It 
was indeed a unique apparition that in the liomish edition of the 
Ptolemjius of 1508 a map of the JSTew Workl by Johann lluysch shoukl 
present itself. Five years later on appeared the Strasburg- rtolemiius, 
that being the earliest chart of the new continent executed beyond the 
Alps. In the interim, however, globes carved in wood had made their 
tirst appearance. 

Notwithstanding the inferiority and brittle nature of the materials 
used in the reduplication of charts, Germany won from the tirst an 
acknowledged supremacy in the delineation of the contours of trans- 
atlantic regions, and it continued to exercise this inHuence, uncon- 
tested, for a full half century. The reason for this is a very remarkable 
one. A small Vosges town, St. Die, tlie seat of the Lothringen Duke 
Renatus, who died in 1508, acquired the foremost prominence in the 
development of the cartography of America. Portuguese marine charts 
and the reports of the four sea voyages of Amerigo A'espucci possibly 
gave the first impulse to this art in 1506. The news brought to the 
Duke was quickly appreciated in the halls of the G-ymnasium College, 
to which VValther Lud, Ringmann, and Waldseemiiller were attached. 
The four marine voyages, in a Latin version, soon appeared, accom- 
panied by a " Cosmographiai introductio," or i^reliminary initiation in 
the principles of cosmographic science, by Waldseemiiller, in which 
the author, as is well known, in 1507 proposed the name America for 
the new continent. At the same time it was decided to convert the 
marine charts, which had just reached the Duke, into a fresh edition of 
the PtoIemJius. The restoration of the charts was placed in the hands 
of Waldseemiiller, but after many delays the work at length appeared 
in 1513. How well this edition succeeded may be recognized from the 
ftict that in 1520 a second impression became necessary, and the 
editions of 1522 and 1525, imitations of the charts of the same locality, 
and even tbe Ptolemiius editions of Lyons in 1535, and of Vienna in 
15-41, were reproductions of the charts of Waldseemiiller. 

St. Die, however, soon lost its lu'ominence after the departure of 
Waldseemiiller. His Ptolemiius certainly appeared in Strasburg. 
Nuremberg succeeded Strasburg with the globe of Schiiner, and thus 
an interest in cosmographic works extended more and more over Ger- 
man territory until its acme was reached at the close of the era in the 
Netherlands and on the Lower Rhine in the writings of Mercator. 

If we now take a retrospective glance at the period when German 
cosmographers dominated in cartographic designs, from 1508 to 15G9, 
several tyi>es, i)artly contemporary and partly subsequent, reveal 
themselves, and acquire prominence in the representation of the 
newly discovered regions of the globe. 

In the interval of time here indicated seven different types may be 
distinguished: 

(1) Johann Ruysch, 1508. In North America the well-known coun- 
tries of Greenland, Labrador, and Baccalaos (Newfoundland) are 



29G DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTOGRAPHY OF AMERICA. 

regarded as the eastern coasts of Asia, whose farther extension south- 
ward is given entirely in accordance with Behaim-Toscauelli. Sonth 
America has no connection with it. 

(2) Waklseeniiiller, 1509. The "Globnstypus," or globe type, with 
the designation America. The New World does not belong to Asia, 
but consists of two parts or divisions intersected by the ocean. The 
Central American straits are a characteristic feature. This impression 
is adopted by Boulenger, Schoner, the so-called Leonardo da Vinci, 
and Nordenskjold's globe (Table 37), together with Apian, Gryniius, 
and Honterus. 

(3) America constitutes an homologous body of land, lying at a con- 
venient distance from Eastern Asia and Western Africa. Stobnecza, 
1512; Waldsemiiller, 1513. 

(4) ISTcrth America, for a considerable extent of territory, is connected 
with Asia. It is, in part, a tendency toward the first type. Accord- 
ing to Ilarrisse (Discovery of Nortli America, \). 284), the idea is to be 
referred to Peter Martyr's Enchiridion (De nuper sub D. Cardo repertis 
insulis, simulque incolarum moribus. Basel, 1521). Perhaps Johanu 
Schoner likewise has given credit to these views in his obsolete globe of 
1523, as he has doubtless done in his Opusculum Geographicum (Niirn- 
berg, 1533), in which he writes, "Unde longissimo tractu occidentem 
versus ab Hispali terra est quu' Mexico etTemistitan vocatur, in super iori 
India, quam priores vocavere Quinsay (thence for a considerable extent 
toward the west from Hispali is a country which is called Mexico and 
Temistitan, which in Upper India our predecessors named (Juinsay). 
Apparently before Schoner's little treatise this idea had been promul- 
gated by the Hollander Franciscus Monachus, 1526, upon the hemi- 
sphere drawn by him. This opinion was disseminated by Oronce Fine, 
and particularly in the Italian Ptolemiius editions (Venice, 1548, 1561, 
1562), and for a long while it found approval in Germany also. 

(5) North America is not united to Asia, but is separated from it by 
a continuous sea, which becomes narrower and narrower from the north 
to the east, and is almost reduced to a strait. The western coast 
extends in a semicircular contiguration toward the North Atlantic 
Ocean. The marine route formerly traced in the middle of the New 
World, is placed toward the north, and, in polar latitudes, is bounded 
by Asia. This extends throughout the whole of America as far as 
Greenland. 

(6) Type of Sebastian Mlinster, in which the intiuence of the chart 
of Verrazzano and of Maggiolo in the north, especially through the 
isthmus south of Newfoundland becomes apparent. South America 
assumes an uncouth, fantastic form. 

(7) North America and northern Asia lie east and west, and not 
north and south, relatively to each other as in (5), A marine strait, in 
shape and location reminding us of Bering Straits separates the two 
continents and is called Fretum Aniau. This view is tirst met with in 
Zaltieri's chart of 1566. Mercator follows it in 1561) and Ortelius in 1570.

ANTAECTICA: A VAKISHED AUSTEAL LAND.i 



By Henry O. Forbes. 



The student of the general fauna aiul flora of the different countries 
of the workl soon finds himself faced by this remarkable fact, that the 
same species of a genus or the same genera of a family often occur at 
spots on the earth's surface separated by enormous distances, in the 
interval between which there is to be found not a single specimen of 
any of them. Before the Darwinian era we were taught that those 
similar isolated forms originated where they are now found by the fiat 
and at the incomj)rehensible will of the Creator; an explanation, how- 
ever unsatisfying, which there w^as no going behind. The purf)ose and 
design in this distribution nuiy have appeared strangely erratic and 
arbitrary, yet our longing to " know why" had to be stifled before this 
ultimate fact that the power that willed it so was inscrutable; nor 
dared one to question further without incurring the charge of sacrile- 
giously prying into the unknowable. The light from laborious embry- 
ological investigation, however, revealed no fact more clearly than this, 
that the individuals of the same family, however far separated on the 
globe, had arisen from the same progenitors by ordinary generation, 
and that the cause of this random distribution of the same forms of life 
iu distant regions might, without impiety, be investigated, and with 
some hope of success. Having once, therefore, all had a common 
ancestry, how did they reach their present habitats, which are half the 
circumference of tbe globe apart, and separated by wide and deep 
oceans, impassable to them unless they flew, swam, sailed over on floats, 
or marched across by bridges that have disappeared between their 
present and their former homes? For instance, the members of that 
curious family of animals with something of the horse and the elephant 
in their composition, the tapirs, are now found only in the southern 
parts of South America on the one side of tbe globe, and in the center 
of the islands of Sumatra and Borneo of the Malay Archipelago on the 
other, and nowhere else. Their bizarre appearance and their close sim-

ilarityiii form and structure render it absolutely certain tliat tliey have 
bad a common parentage, and tbat, tbougb now living so widely sun- 
dered from each otber, tbey radiated from one ancestral bome. 

To trace out the migration of the varied forms of life, both animal 
and vegetable, to their present habitats forms one of the most absorb- 
ing of zoo-geographical investigations — a "study," as Mr. Wallace well 
remarks, "which will surely lead - - - to a fuller comprehension 
of the complex relations and mutual interdependence which link every 
animal and vegetable form with the ever-changing earth which sup- 
ports them into one grand organic whole," and which, besides, will 
enable the investigator to denuirk with increasing certainty, as his 
labors jn'ogress, the changes in fluctuation of land and water which 
the globe has from age to age restlessly experienced. As soon as our 
knowledge of the fauna and flora of the continents and islands of the 
globe had advanced sufticiently far to enable fairly accurate system- 
atic catalogues of the animals and plants inhabiting them to be drawn 
up, many singular anomalies came to light, some of which have been 
apparently suiflciently explained, while of others the causes are still 
as inexi)li cable as ever. 

In the year 1801 those distinguished paleontologists. Professors Herr 
and linger, pointed out that the present vegetation of the Eastern 
States of America exhibited remarkable resemblances to that which 
flourished in Europe during the Miocene age, and they suggested the 
hypothesis that during the Miocene period Euro])e and America were 
united by a land bridge (long celebrated as the Atlantis continent), 
which stretched across the Atlantic Ocean. By the perusal of the 
essay of these botanists, Recherches sur le Climat et la Vegetation du 
Pays Tertiare, Professor Oliver, of Kew, having been induced to inves- 
tigate "carefully the relations between the Tertiary and some existing 
floras," was led to the conclusion that the intercommunity of "types 
in the Tertiary beds of Europe and the present flora of the eastern 
States of the North American continent took i)lace, not over an Atlan- 
tis, but over land j)robably in a comparatively high latitude to the 
north of the Pacific Ocean" ^ — that is to say, that the flora of Europe 
followed the climate as, in that epoch, it became more and more genial 
into the circumpolar regions, and thence it dispersed southward again 
on the advent of the cold, into such parts of Asia and America as it 
could obtain foothold in. That a genial climate and a vegetation of 
very temi)erate character did exist to within nearly 8° of the North 
Pole, was proved in a most conclusive manner by the officers of the 
Arctic expedition of 1876, who discovered, in those now ice-bound 
latitudes, fossil plants which now grow not farther north than mid- 
Europe. 

Perhaps nothing in natural history surprised naturalists more than 
the distributional facts — both of the fauna and the flora — first indicated 

1 "Tlie Atlantis hypothesis iu its botanical aspect," The Natural History Review, 
1862, page 149. 



ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND. 299 

by Mr. A. E. Wallace ou the east and west sides of wliat is known as 
Wallace's Line, which separates the two Malayan islands of Bali and 
Lombock. The strait that separates these islands is so narrow that, 
standing on the vessel's deck, the voyager to the southward has an 
excellent view of the land on both sides, and can admire the richly 
forest-clad and shapely volcanic cones of Agong and Eiiyani that 
tower into the blue on his right hand and on his left. To "the eastern 
side of this line," Mr. Wallace writes, " the fauna and the flora, and 
even the people, are essentially Australian; to the western side, as 
essentially Asiatic." On crossing this narrow passage from west to 
east " we at once meet with those singular birds, the mound builders 
(Megapodidce), as well as friar birds and other honeysuckers, cockatoos, 
and many other groups found only in the Australian regions; while a 
large number of animals found in everyone of the Asiatic islands sud- 
denly disappear. We have no longer any elephants, rhinoceroses, or 
tigers; none of the carnivora but a common civet cat (probably intro- 
duced); none of the insectivora but a small shrew; none of the num- 
erous rodents but one or two squirrels." Yet in the island of Timor, 
farther to the east and near to Australia, one is surprised to discover 
that, as Mr. Wallace points out, the characteristic mammals of Aus- 
tralia are quite as much wanting as those of Asia. " Birds," he 
remarks, " however, having the means of passing freely over narrow 
arms of the sea, have not been excluded, and, notwithstanding the sim- 
ilarity in climate and vegetation to Australia, the birds and insects of 
Timor more resemble those of Java, Celebes, and the Moluccas." These 
islands are hundreds of miles apart, and yet have an interchange, 
according to Mr. Wallace, of many birds and insects; while from Bali 
and Lombock, which gaze on each other across a narrow arm of the 
sea, there has been, when the distances apart of the two localities are 
compared, only a slight interchange. In South America again we have 
genera of monkeys and birds living in abundance along one bank of a 
river, which apparently find this comi)aratively narrow line of water 
an impassable barrier. 

Li a paper contributed to The Fortnightly Review in May last I 
referred to the discovery in the Chatham Islands (near New Zealand) 
of the subfossil remains of birds which were up to that time known to 
have lived only a few hundred years since in the Mascarene Islands 
as confirming the belief that there must have existed in the southern 
seas an extensive continuous land similar to that in the Northern 
Hemisphere, on which the common ancestors of the forms unknown 
north of the equator, but confined to one or more of the southern 
extremities of the great continents, lived and multiplied, and whence 
they could disperse in all directions. "This lost continent," 1 observed 
then, "I am constrained to believe from evidence which space does 
not on the present occasion permit me to adduce, lies in part beneath 
the southern ice cap, and it approached to or included the Antarctic

islands as well as extended northward to unite with the southern 
extremities of South America, i)erhaps with Africa, and with the 
Mascarene, the Australian, and the New Zealand continental islands." 
The larger evidence to which I then referred I purpose now to lay 
before the readers of this Eeview. 

We find either still living or preserved fossil in the strata of their 
Tertiary formations in regions of the Southern Hemisphere so widely 
apart as the south of South America, the Madagascar region, Austra- 
lia, and New Zealand inany forms of plants and animals unknown in 
the Northern Hemisphere possessing so many characters in common 
as to show at once that they are descended from the same stock. 

To commence with birds, the distribution of the ostrich group is 
very remarkable. New Zealand, as it is scarcely necessary to remind 
the reader, is celebrated for the remains of those extinct giants of the 
family known as moas. Their bones are found all over the two main 
islands of which that colony consists, and they might have been gath- 
ered in the early years of its settlement by Europeans in vast numbers 
from off the surface of the ground, especially in the interior of the prov- 
inces of Canterbury and Otago, or from the sandy flats of the larger 
rivers where they had become exposed by the action of the wind. 
They have also been found in caves, under rock shelters, and in the 
ancient kitchen middens of the natives, as well as exhumed in enor- 
mous quantities from the peat bogs of both islands, where they have 
been discovered huddled together in crowds of many hundreds. These 
birds varied very greatly in size, the larger specimens attaining a stat- 
ure of from 10 to 12 feet. They had bones of herculean j)roportions, and, 
needless to say, they were quite unable to fly, being, indeed, devoid of 
wings. Their feathers, which, singularly enough, have been preserved 
to us in considerable numbers, show that each had an after shaft equal 
in length to the primary plumes of their contour feathers — forming, as 
it were, a double feather — a characteristic mark of the ostriches of the 
Australian region, the emus and cassowaries ; and they all possessed, 
on the metatarsal bone, articular pulleys for three toes instead of two, 
as the African ostrich has. Australia also included in its bird fauna 
of ancient days a giant ostrich, the Dromornis, and now possesses the 
emu, while New Guinea reckons at the present time the cassowary — of 
which one species crosses into Australia — among its wonderful bird 
inhabitants. In the distant island of Madagascar also there flourished 
once, though now extinct, a member of the same family, the ^liJpyornis, 
a giant, if not in height, at all events in the bulk and dimensions of its 
limbs, which appear to have exceeded those of even the most elephan- 
tine of the moas. Yet another stately member, the Brontornis, lived 
m early ages in southern Patagonia, a necessarily flightless bird, 
which, as we know from its fossil remains, far excelled in stature even 
the tallest of its New Zealand relatives. This remarkable group of 
birds, therefore, we find occupied New Zealand, Australia, Madagas-

car, and South America — that is, their distribution extended right 
round, and was i^ractically confined to the lands of the Southern Hem- 
isphere, in whicli the area that each occupies is seen from a study of 
the map to be separated from the other by vast stretches of unbridged 
ocean. Yet a comparison of their skeletons — for of the moa, the 
^Epyornis, and the Brontornis we have only their fossil bones to judge 
from — leaves little doubt that they are all ramifications of one branch 
of the same genealogical tree which flourished in a region which I hope 
to indicate in the course of this i^aper, and that they wandered in 
all directions from a common land by roads which I shall presently 
attempt to trace. 

The traveler interested in bird life who has spent some time either in 
South Africa, or in South Australia, or has had the good fortune to 
land on the shores of Terra del Fuego, or of one of the Antarctic 
islands, can scarcely have failed to watch those quaint fishlike birds, 
the penguins, which are far more at home under the water than they 
are on the land. They breed in enormous rookeries on some of the 
more unfrequented southern islands, but they are met with in all parts 
of the Southern Hemisphere south of 40 degrees of south latitude, 
each island or continent having some species peculiar to itself. One 
important point in their history is that none of the family have ever 
been found on the northern side of the equator, a distribution which 
has probably been always equally circumscribed within these latitudes, 
for their earliest fossil remains — osteologically identical throughout the 
enormous period separating the Eocene from to day — are known only 
from, and are, so far as I am aware, confined to the older Tertiary 
formations of New Zealand and Patagonia. More interesting still, 
perhaps, and very important from the point of view of the subject of 
this paper, is the distribution of the Chionidce, a family of beautiful, 
pure white birds related to the plovers. These sheath bills, as they are 
named, from a conspicuous horny sheath at the base of their bills, are 
not marine but land birds. They would be incapable of undertaking a 
journey of any great duration across the sea where they could find 
nothing to support them; yet they are found, so far as known, in 
Fuegia and the neighboring Falkland Islands, but not elsewhere till 
the far-off Crozet Islands and Kerguelen Land are reached. 

The well-known and brilliantly plumaged family of the parrots have 
their chief development in the Australian and Papuan regions and in 
South America (with a few stragglers extending up into North Amer- 
ica), while in South Africa and in India they are but feebly represented. 
Now, the curious owl i^arrots and the keas of New Zealand have a 
near relationship with the macaws of South America. Mr. Wallace 
has pointed out that an unusual style of coloration occurs among the 
parrots living both in Australia and the Mascarene Islands ; and that 
though in Australia alone species adorned with crests now live, yet 
within the historical period, such forms occurred in the Mascarene

region also — clianicters, lie observes, "too well marked to be considered 
accidental." * 

In tlie May number of The Fortuigbtly Review I have already drawn 
attention to the fact that what now constitutes New Zealand was but 
a small portion of a once far greater continental island — which I have 
designated Antipodea — stretching south as far at least as the Mac- 
quarie Islands, and embracing all those lying between them and the 
Chatham Islands, as well as those to the northward as far as iSTew Cale- 
donia, the Fiji, the Friendly, and the Kermadec islands — a fact de- 
duced from the occurrence on these separated specks of land of a 
common flora and fauna which could not have arrived there without a 
land connection. On that occasion also, I spoke of the discovery in 
the Chatham Islands — an unsubmerged portion of a once larger 
region — of the remains of two birds, a tall coot [FuHca) and a giant 
wood hen {Apkanapteryx)^ which had been i^reviously known only from 
Mauritius, which is also an unsubmerged j)ortion of a greater conti- 
nental island, comprising Bourbon, Rodriguez, Madagascar, and the 
Seychelles. The wood hens, a group of rails entirely unknown in the 
Northern Hemisphere, are in the Southern Hemisi)here absolutely con- 
fined to the islands of the Mascarene and of the New Zealand archi- 
pelagoes, which are separated from each other by nearly half the cir- 
cumference of the globe. Dr. R. Bowdler Sharpe, speaking not long 
ago on the "Geographical distribution of birds," at the Royal Institu- 
tion, pointed out additional relationships (so far as their birds are con- 
cerned) between these same widely disconnected areas. In the Island 
of Bouibon there lived, till exterminated in comparatively recent times 
by incursive Europeans, a very peculiar starling with a long, slightly 
curved bill, the Fregiluptis, the sole species of its genus, of which 
one of the very few examples that have been preserved may be 
seen mounted in the bird gallery of the Natural History Museum at 
South Kensington. It has. no near relatives except in New Zealand, 
where the huia {HcteralocJia gouldi), a bird eciually peculiar and the 
solitary representative of its genus, forms one of the most interesting 
species of one of the most peculiar bird faunas of the world. The 
huia is remarkable in that the shape, of the beak differs in the two 
sexes in a most surprising manner in association with habits unique, I 
believe so far as yet known, among the- feathered tribes. The bill of 
the male is straight, i^owerful, and sharp; that of the female is in com- 
parison exceedingly slender and strongly curved. Tlie straight-beaked 
bird breaks up and chips oft' the bark and wood of trees, in quest of 
the tunnels of the grubs and insects that form their food; while the 
closely attendant female is keenly on the alert to thrust in its slender, 
curved forceps — where the beak of its mate is useless — to extract each 
nutritious morsel when discovered. Both are aberrant forms of their 
family, and both are on excellent authority considered to be descend- 
ants of the same ancestor. In the same two regions also, alone of all 



ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND. 303 

the globe, there lived down to recent times, but now extinct (though 
ornithologists still cling to the hope that a few survivors may yet be 
holding out in the dense forests of southwest ^ew Zealand), giant and 
flightless forms of blue water hens of two species, the Aptornis and 
the JVb/ornis, of which as yet no remains have come to light in the 
Mascarenes, but are still found in some abundance in the caves and 
swamps of New Zealand. 

The late Mr. W. A. Forbes (who at the time of his death held the post 
of prosector to the Zoological- Society of London, and had already be- 
come distinguished as one of the best anatomists who had filled that 
most coveted position), a man remarkable for the keenness of his 
observational powers, for the amount and accuracy of his knowledge, 
and for the tenacity of his memory in regard to details of structure, 
investigated shorth' before his death the relationships of Acanthido- 
sitta and Xenicus, lively little birds which are year by year becoming 
rarer in the forests and on the rocky talus slopes among the hills of 
New Zealand, and discovered that, in their anatomical structure, they 
have their nearest allies in Australia (and in part of the Indian region), 
in Madagascar, and in South America, but exhibit few affinities with 
groups elsewhere. 

Professor Huxley many years ago, in a remarkable paper, read before 
the Zoological Society of London, on the "Classification of the galli- 
naceous birds," i^ointed out that they fall into two great groups, the one 
broadly occupying the Northern Hemisphere, and the other the South- 
ern Hemisiihere — Australasia and South xVmerica; thus dividing the 
globe into two regions which In-, felicitously termed Arctoga\a and 
Notoga?a. The Notoga^an section of these birds comjirises," according 
to him, the mound builders or megapodes {Megupodklcv) in Australia 
and Papuasia, and the curassows or guans {Cracidcc) in South America, 
both of which jjossess structural peculiarities in common, pointing to 
the fact that, though they now form different and easily distinguish- 
able fajnilies occupying distant areas of the globe, they sprang from 
the same stock. 

The relationships of the groups above referred to as distributionally 
confined to the Southern Hemispliere are such as as can be made out 
by a trained eye without going very far below the surface; they are 
classified by characters either externally apparent or recognizable by 
an examination of their osteology or their coarser anatomy. But we 
have evidence of the same affinities existing between the fauna of the 
same dissociated portions of the globe derived from a deeper source 
than these. It is but a year or two since science had to mourn in the 
death of Prof. W, K. Parker the loss of the very foremost of English 
morphologists, and one whose knowledge of the anatomy — especially of 
the cranial structure — not only of birds but of most of the vertebrates, 
from their embryo onward, was unrivaled. In one of those numerous 
erudite papers, lit up with brilliant thoughts and analogies expressed 



304 ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND. 

in deeply poetic language — unexpected in a subject so abstruse — an. 
superbly illustrated by his own band, which he communicated to thi 
Zoological, the Liimeau, and the Royal societies of London throughout 
his life, he has published his labors on tLe embryology of some of th 
birds most typical of Australia — its piping crows, its warblers, ai 1 
wood swallows. He devoted himself especially to the investigation >f 
the cranial constitution of birds from the very early stages of tbeir 
existence, for he believed that " the outward form of the face gives t'le 
keynote to the whole bird; the head and' face rule all things else, jrid 
every modification in the organs of progression must be in correlation 
with that deeper change which has taken place in the storied and 
labyrinthine walls of the head." lie has unfolded their lineage as surely 
as if he had witnessed its growth through the vistas of the past by 
watching the laying together of each sep. rate element before ''nature 
with her cementing osteoblasts had obliierated their individuality." 
His penetrating eye detected the existence and recognized the signifi- 
cance to their pedigree of those structures, useless to the individual 
save that each new life must inexorably ascend by all the stairs its 
sires have climbed before it, which within the secrecy of the egg ai)pear 
but for an hour and vanish as if they had never been. The pedigree 
of the Australian piping crows arises, he finds, from the same stock 
as the South American creepers {Dendrocolaptida^) ; that of the wood 
swallows oscillates between the ground thrushes {Pitta) of the Malayan 
Archipelago and the South American ant thrushes; while the affinities 
of the Australian warblers are with the wood warblers {Mniotiltidw) of 
South America, all of them declaring their afitinity with forms in the 
Southern and not in the Northern Hemispheie — with groups whose 
homes are not on land areas continuous to their own, but in regions 
separated by wide seas, and at their farthest limits apart. 

Such is the singular disconnected distribution of many undoubtedly 
related groups of birds, of a^ hich I shall presently proceed to offer an 
explanation. 

Before doing so I wish to refer shortly to other sections of the ani- 
mal kingdom. It is well known that Australia is the great home of 
those lowly mammals, the marsupials, the survivors of a family whose 
ancestry dates back to the Trias, a period to be reckoned only in ages, 
each perhaps of thousands of centuries. They are remarkable, as an 
order, for containing " isomorphs," or groups that have tlie form and 
habits of many of the various other orders of the animal kingdom. 
The kangaroo rats, for instance, assume the outward form of our com- 
mon rats and mice; others, such as the beautiful Hying phalangers, 
resemble the insectivora; while yet others, as the "Tasmanian dev^ 
are large, carnivorous, and wolf-like. liesides the Austromalaya, 
region (which is a jiart of the Australasian realm), no region of the 
globe now (contains any representative of those implacental animals, 
except the South American forests (from which two species have wan-

dered into i^ortb America). The present marsupials, however, of South 
America (the opossums) exhibit wide differences from those now living 
in Australia; it is therefore not improbable that their ancestry must 
be traced from forms once living, but now found fossil only, in North 
America. The singular implacental animals now living in Australia 
are but the remnants of a much more extensive order; for there van- 
ished at a comparatively recent geological i^eriod other marsupials still 
more remarkable, especially for their gigantic size. Of these the Dip- 
rotodon attained to the proportions of a rhinoceros or a hippopotamus, 
and the Noiotherium to that of a tapir; while the ThyJacoJeo was a 
gigantic carnivore that j)robably i^reyed on the titanic kangaroo of its 
own time, an animal twice as tall as the largest " old man " kangaroo 
{Macrojms {jiganten.s) of to-day, which has been known to measure 
nearly 6 feet from the point of the nose to the root of the tail. The 
interest of these remains has largely increased through the discoveries 
of South American paleontologists who have quite recently disinterred 
most unexpected treasures from the early Tertiary formations of Pata- 
gonia, the first fruits, there can be little doubt, of a large harvest of 
remains, which will certainly shed, as those already obtained have 
done, a flood of light on the pedigree of many of the vertebrata. Among 
these treasures not the least important are the remains of marsupials 
closely related to the DiprotodoUj the Thylacoleo, and the "Tasmanian 
devil," which, in the Pliocene age, flourished in Australia in such 
abundance. 

Turning for a moment to still another group of the vertebrata, we 
find that, in such widely separated spots as New Zealand, Patagonia, 
and the Falkland Islands, there occur identical species of different 
families of fresh-water fishes. The southern salmon {HaplocMtonidw) 
and the southern pikes {Galaxiidw), which are unknown north of the 
equator, and which could not traverse the wide expanse of sea dividing 
them, are common to all of these localities. Our highest authority on 
ichthyology. Dr. A. Griinther,P. R. S., of the British Museum, has shown 
that between the freshwater fishes of Africa and Australia there is, 
though not an extensive, yet an unmistakable affinity; while, with 
many points of close resemblance between them, the African and the 
South American genera are distinct, which indicates " that the separa- 
tion of these continents must have been of old date." 

Mr. Wallace has, in his great work on The Distribution of Animals, 
pointed out how insects, as a whole, show a decided interrelation 
between Australia and South America. Indeed, he believes that the 
Buprestidw, a family of brilliantly metallic beetles, had their original 
development in temperate Australia, and spread thence, while of the 
longicorn beetle (so named from the long antennee they possess) several 
genera are common to South America, Australia, and New Zealand, 
indicating that there must have been some means of communication 
between these countries other than at present. Both the families of

insects I liave mentioned are wood borers, living on soft or decaying 
trees, in which also their larvse are developed, and necessarily reqnir- 
ing for their growth and differentiation throughout the area of their 
dispersal an extensive and wooded region — a genial Antarctic conti- 
nent, not merely a series of far separated islands as stepping stones. 

Now if we turn to the plants of the Southern Hemisphere, and con- 
fining our attention to those not or l)ut slightly ranging with the north 
of the equator, we find they present the same i)roblems for solution as 
the fauna oftered. Of the charming saxifrage family there are two 
tribes [EscaUoniecc and Gunoniem) which are peculiarly restricted to the 
south of the equator. They contain between them thirty-five genera, 
of which two only cross that boundary; the remaining thirty-three 
genera are distributed to New Caledonia, New Zealand, Australia (with 
Tasmania), the Mascarene Islands, and South America areas, as we 
have seen above in the case of the fauna, occupied by related forms, 
though separated from each other by wide seas. Of the forty-nine 
genera and nine hundred and fifty species of the Proteacccv, the whole, 
with the infinitesimal exception of twenty-five species which pass to 
the north of the line, are distributed across the same regions, with the 
addition of South Africa. The genus Cryptocarya of the Fcrseaccw is 
common to New Zealand, South Africa, and South America, while 
among the genera of other families we find some occurring in Africa, 
or Madagascar and Australia; some in Tasmania and South America 
only; while others crop up in South Africa and Australia, or New 
Zealand, or in New Zealand and South America only. During my 
travels in the Eastern Archipelago I discovered growing wild in the 
forests of Java a large colony of Fetrcea arhorea, an arboreal species of 
the Verbenacew, which at the end of the last century (1792) was found 
by Smith and Wiles, on the Providence expedition, in Timor also. This 
genus was i)reviously supposed to be entirely confined to the South 
American continent. And yet another near relative, Petrcca vitex, has 
still more lately been obtained in the islands of Burn and Amboina. 

Now, as to the explanation of these instances of singularly discon- 
nected distribution of so nmuy plants and animals, the highest authori- 
ties are by no means agreed. Nor is it a question that can be finally 
settled while our information on many points necessary to its solution is 
so fragmentary. Year by year, however, new discoveries are mending 
the imperfections of our records, while continued sifting of the evidence 
already gathered is gradually eliminating what is unreliable and estab- 
lishing more firndy that which is trustworthy. So far as his latest 
opinions have been expressed, Mr. Wallace, our highest authority on 
geographical distribution, holds that the presence of these numerous 
genera and species of the same families or groups of plants and animals 
in Australasia, in the Mascarene Islands, or in South Africa, and in 
South America, can be sufficiently explained as the remnants of ancient 
types once spread over the Northern Hemisphere, whose lands are prac- 



ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND. 307 

tically continuous, driven southward along- tliese continents by the 
pressure of more specialized tyi)es, and now hnding refuge in these 
widely separated southern lands. No one can differ from Mr. Wallace 
on this subject without great diffidence, and certainly no one can feel a 
profounder admiration, even veneration, than the present writer (who 
has followed in so many of his footsteps in the archipelago he has made 
famous, with his fascinating book as his best guide and companion) for 
the opinions and writings of this most distinguished doyen of our 
naturalists. Still, I can not persuade myself that this explanation covers 
all tlie instances of discontinuous distribution — of forms unknown in 
the Northern Hemisphere — which have been adduced in the foregoing 
pages. It seems too extraordinary to be credible that ifc sliould alone 
have been the same forms that have survived the vicissitudes of climate 
and food during their long migrations through the deserts and forests 
of Asia, Malaya, and Australia to reach ISTew Zealand; of Eurojie and 
Africa to reach the Cape and Madagascar, and of North and South 
America to arrive in Patagonia, and even in the Antarctic islands, and 
that scarcely a single representative of their line should have survived 
north of the equator. Nor does the explanation that has also been 
oifered of the occurrence of the same genera and species in those 
remote regions — that they have been the result of independent devel- 
opment — appear to me to be more satisfactory; for the chances against 
the same genus or species becoming developed inde])endently at various 
times in three or four distinct regions of the globe, under different con- 
ditions and latitudes, and only in the southern extremities of the great 
continents, are enormously great. 

It has hitherto been laid down as a fundamental law in geographical 
distribution that the areas inhabited by a given species, and in con- 
sideral)le measure likewise by the same genera, are or have been 
continuous with each other. The conclusion has been forced upon us, 
therefore, that there must once have existed in the Southern Ocean a 
land area common to the terminations of the great continents exten- 
sive enough to afford room for the development of the ancestors of so 
many forms of life absent from the Northern Hemisphere; and that it 
was very genial in climate and clad with vegetation sufficiently luxu- 
riant to support so varied a fauna. In studying the Southern Hemi- 
sphere on a globe, on which the natural relations of land and water are 
■evident, and tracing out the continental shelf surrounding the exist- 
ing Antarctic land within the contour of the 2,00()-fathom line, so far as 
it is known, I was surprised to observe that the land that would result 
from such an elevation of the Antarctic sea floor would explain the 
perplexing distribution of the southern fauna and flora. It was also 
evident that a continent so formed would not interfere with the opin- 
ions entertained by so many of our highest geological authorities and 
oceanographers, that the beds of the great oceans are troughs, and the 
great meridianal land masses are buckles (in parts at one time dry and

at another submerged) of the earth's crust, both of which have practi- 
cally been permaneut since primeval times, or to quote Mr. Darwin, 
tbat "where our oceans now extend, oceans have extended from the 
remotest period of which we have any record; and where conthients 
now exist large tracts of land have existed, subjected, no doubt, to 
great oscillations of level since the Cambrian period." 

The boundaries of this continent of Antarctica, as I have proposed 
to designate it, would have united Patagonia, New Zealand (as part 
of sucli a large continental island as I have described and named 
Antipodea, on page 209), Tasuuinia with East Australia, and that old 
island continent (joined, perhaps, by a narrow commissure, for a longer 
or shorter time, to East Africa), which Dr. Sclater long- ago named 
Ijemuria, to a circumpolar land greater than at present by extensive 
independent peninsulas, between which the Atlantic, the Pacitic, and 
the Indian oceans extended almost as far south as they do now. It 
will be observed that South Africa is excluded in this view from actual 
contact with this southern continent. That it did not remain so long- 
as the others in direct connection with Antarctica seems indicated by 
the presence of so aberrant a form of the struthious family in that 
country as its ostriches, which possess on their tarso-metatarsal bones 
two articulatory trochlcie only, thus reducing theirs to a two toed 
instead of a tiiree-toed foot, as is found in the moas, the A^Jpyornis, the 
cassowaries, the emus, and the Brontornis. The loss of this toe points 
unquestionably to a very long isolation of the ostrich from inter- 
marriage with the more normal members of its order. The African 
ostriches also differ from the eastern members of the family, in having 
no after- shaft to their contour feathers, a character in which they 
agree with the rheas of South America, a group to which the African 
ostriches are more closely, though still very distantly, related than 
perhaps to any of the others. It would seem highly probable also that 
the connection between South America and Africa was severed at a 
very early period — an assumi)tion supported by the distribution of the 
fresh-water fishes of Patagonia and South Africa, which, though indi- 
cating, as Dr. Giinther has so well elucidated, by the undoubted affini- 
ties between them, a previous approximation of the two regions, yet in 
the distinctness of their genera plainly speaks of a long disseverance. 
The boundaries of this Antarctic continent, which I have indicated, 
would have inclosed all the circumpolar land and the islands in the 
Southern Sea. Actual, apart from deductive, evidence for the exist- 
ence of a greater extension of land in this region is of course very 
limited, yet it is not altogether absent. 

No visitor to the Chatham Islands can fail to be struck by the num- 
ber of lakes and tarns that everywhere dot the landscape. Nor can he 
travel far without remarking that the surface of the ground is covered 
by a continuous layer of peat, which is in many places 40 to 50 feet 
deep, and in some still unfathomed. It is in general solid enough 



ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND. 309 

to permit safe traffic over it, but extensive areas are covered with 
unsuspected wet bogs extremely dangerous to a pedestrian unacquainted 
with the country. The time required for the accumuhition of this 
enormous deposit maybe imagined when it is remembered that it takes 
several feet of sphagnum — the moss of which peat is chiefly composed — 
as seen growing on the surface of the bog, to form 1 inch of dense 
black peat at its bottom. Everywhere throughout those peat bogs 
trunks of trees, larger than and of a different sort to those that now 
grow in the islands, lie entombed. They are the remains of ancient 
forests which have succumbed "to the chilling effects of the wet bog 
mosses in their upward growth." The woods that now or did recently 
(for they are fast disappearing before the demands of the agriculturist) 
cover the gronnd are but the latest of a succession of forests already 
swallowed up tliat had in turn taken possession of the land wherever 
the water had drained away and the growth of the mosses ceased.^ 
The antiquity of these islands is proved by the fact that in different 
places the more ancient of these peat beds have become consolidated 
into lignite. 

This account of the surface features of the Chatham Islands might 
serve e([ually for those of Kerguelen Land, which also abounds in large 
bogs, in lakes and great pools in the hills, and in fiords — all evidences 
of great anticpiity, of glaciation jDrobably, and certainly of very exten- 
sive subsidence. In the Auckland Islands also occur bogs and beds of 
bituminous peat; while both in the Crozets and in Kerguelen Land 
fossil trunks of large trees have been found, all distinctly i)ointing to 
the existence of extensive and varied forests on these now sleet-swept, 
bare, inhospitable lands. The prevalent features of the present flora 
of Kerguelen are Fuegian, many of the species in both regions being 
identical or nearly related, while others are common to Tasmania, and 
still others to one or more of the unsubmerged fragments of Antipodea 
(New Zealand and its surrounding islands), and some to all these three 
regions, one fern being common to Kerguelen and the Cape of Good 
Hope. To Kerguelen Land and to Marion Island, 1,600 miles west of 
it, is confined a still more remarkable genus of plants, known as Pring- 
lea. It is very distinct, is without near relatives, and is the survivor 
of a flora unknown in any other i)art of the globe. Its seeds are per- 
ishable, and on this account it is very unlikely that it has been con- 
veyed by birds from one island to the other; and is therefore with 
high iirobability indigenous to both. Its distribution to those isolated 
spots, and various " phenomena, besides, common to the tliree archi- 
pelagoes — Kerguelen, Crozets, and Marion — favor," in the opinion of 
Sir Josei)h Hooker and other high botanical authorities, the " inference

or an archipelago extending fortlier westward," on which the progeni- 
tors of their once existing, or still surviving, endemic flora became 
developed. 

On a former page it was predicated that if such an austral continent 
ever did exist, it must have been blessed with a very genial if not a 
tropical climate, cai)able of supporting extensive forests and other lux- 
uriant vegetation lit to harbor and nourish the marsupials, the birds, 
and the insects found in these southern regions. That such extensive 
forests did exist in far southern latitudes requires no more ])roof than 
the occurrence of the fossil tree stems in Kerguelen Land and in the 
Crozets; while I shall now try to show that the genial climate of which 
I have spoken once prevailed in these islands. 

It is to the late Dr. James Croll that we owe the first satisfactory 
account of the astronomical and physical causes on which climate 
depends, especially in reference to the causes of the glacial epochs, 
which he proved to be, in that hemisphere, due to the occurrence of 
winter when its pole was turned away from the sun at the same time 
that the earth during its greatest eccentricity was at its farthest dis- 
tance in its orbit from the source of heat. Sir liobert Ball, who has 
made some important additions to this theory (by establishing mathe- 
matically the dilferent percentages of heat that are received in the 
summer and in the winter of each hemisphere) emphatically asserts, as 
a mathematician, that it is of the essence of the astronomical theory 
that "the glaciation over the hemisphere shall be simultaneous,"' and if 
it were not so "it would seem wholly imi)ossible to offer an explanation 
of the phenomena by any i)hysical cause known to us." On the other 
hand, "viewing the two hemispheres each as a whole it is imijortantto 
observe that their respective glaciatious were not simultaneous," 
indeed "if it could be shown that the ice ages in the two hemispheres 
were concurrent, the astronomical doctrine would have to be forthwith 
abandoned." " It is also of the essence of the astronomical theory," he 
maintains, "that a glacial epoch in one hemisphere shall be accom- 
panied by a genial epoch in the other, and that, after certain thousands 
of years, the climatic conditions of the two hemispheres shall become 
interchanged; that the ice shall leave - - - and the regions tbat it 
has abandoned shall become clothed with luxuriant vegetation." Since 
the duration of the eccentricity of the earth's orbit, when once it 
supervenes, endures through a period in which the rotation of the line 
of the equinoxes round the eclipse may take place more than once, 
"clusters of ice ages and genial ages" may have followed each other 
before each period of high eccentricity which originated them passed 
away. "Each hemisphere is plunged alternately into extremely gla- 
cial and extremely genial conditions, and though, no doubt, during tlie 
transition, there may be centuries during which intermediate condi- 
tions will prevail, yet such periods can hardly be said to have resem- 



ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND. 311 

bled the normal coiiditious of the globe siicli as tluit wliicli it now 
enjoys." ' 

Many autborities are of opinion that great subsidences of land are 
natural concomitants of a glacial period, and that it naturally follows 
that the accumulation of ice at one pole must abstract and pile u^) a 
large amount of water, and thus cause laud in the opposite hemisphere 
to be uncovered. 

During the continuance, therefore, of the glacial epoch in the North- 
ern Hemisphere, there must have existed over the Southern Hemisphere 
an extremely genial epoch, during which there is no doubt that where- 
ever land existed it was clothed with a luxuriant vegetation, and that 
its boundaries would be enlarged from the causes just spoken of. This 
vegetation would, doubtless, not be less varied and tropical than that 
which flourished in high northern latitudes in Miocene times, and which 
was still a remarkably temi)erate flora within 8^ degrees of the North 
Pole, and it is evident that it could harbor, and on it there could 
develop the ancestors of the fauna and flora whose descendants are now 
scattered across all the southern regions of the globe. That an exten- 
sive land did exist not dissimilar to that described in a former page, 
seems to me almost an inevitable deduction from the distributional facts 
adduced above— especially in regard to the insects, the marsupials, the 
birds, and the plants. Of this mass of evidence, the distribution — to 
shortly recapitulate — of tlie three trochleaed struthious birds in all the 
great regions; the Aphanapteryx, the blue gallinules, the starlings, and 
the crested parrots in Antipodea and Lemuria; the fresh- water fishes 
of Australia and America — none of them northern forms — is, to me at 
least, evidence not otherwise explicable. But none of that evidence 
seems to me to testify with greater weight than the embryological and 
anatomical data, which I have quoted from the writings of those dis- 
tinguished workers, Parker and Forbes, two men of the highest 
authority in their science, inasmuch as it has been detected, not in the 
sui)erflcial characters only, but deep down in structures whose simi- 
larity cannot but proclaim genetic relationship, through ancestors who 
have now vanished, and whose homes must have been on a land com- 
mon to and in connection with those widely separated regions which 
their descendants now occupy. The necessity for the existence of a 
land surface in the Antarctic Ocean was recognized and has been 
expressed by Mr. Darwin. "New Zealand is plainly," he says, "related 
to South America, which though the next nearest continent is enor- 
mously remote, yet this difticulty disappears in the view that New Zea- 
land, South America, and the other southern lands have been stocked in 
part from the Antarctic islands when they were clothed with vegetation 
during a warmer Tertiary period."^ Dr. Blanford, in his well-known

address to the Geological Society of Loudon, in 1S90, gave it as liis 
opinion that "if the difficulty about the depth of the intervening ocean 
is overcome" — and such a continent as I have sketched out in the 
rough, whose shores, more or less, followed the 2,000-fathom line, pre- 
sents no insui)erable bathj-metrical difficulties to acceptance — "there 
is no improbability in the suggestion that at some i)eriod of geolog- 
ical history au important continent, having" connections with South 
America, South Africa, and New Zealand, may have occupied the 
Antarctic area." 

Tliroughout his wonderful papers on the embryology of the bird's 
skull. Professor Parker' constantly perceives and insists on the neces- 
sity of dividing birds into northern and southern forms: " In the South 
the most struthious tyjves, and in the iSTorth the highest," and he 
expresses his belief that our bird groups are " as important for study in 
their geographical distribution as in their taxonomy or their morphol 
ogy." Professor Parker constantly adduces also instances of the rela- 
tionship of the birds of the eastern with those of the western side of 
Notogwa. " If these instances, " he says, " of changed forms in the east- 
ern Notogiea, corresponding to unchanged (or less changed) types in 
the western Notoga^a, can be shown to be common, it will go far toward 
the establishment of a true theory of dispersion and modification of 
types. If not, if every zoological species has been created, as it is now, 
fenced in by laws that can not be broken, 'a hedge set about it and 11 
that it hath,' then I trust, for the sake of true science, that this glam- 
our will soon be removed from our eyes, and that we shall not be hired 
on farther after evolutional 'will-O'-the-wisps.'" This bond of organic 
community must have been by a land area in the southern seas, which 
with considerable probability occupied the region which I have desig- 
nated Antarctica. It seems to me that such geological evidence as 
the occurrence of fossil penguins in the Eocene of both Patagonia and 
New Zealand, and of marsupials and dinornithine ostriches in the early 
Tertiaries of South America, of Dinornu and Jjpyornis in New Zea- 
land and Madagascar, point to the existence of southerji land — doubt- 
less with elevations and subsidences between — at least from the close 
of Secondary times. But it is impossible, at least yet, to determine 
whether the fauna and flora of which remnants exist in the preseut 
southern continents and islands are the result of the development 
and dispersal during the genial i^eriod corresponding to the last of tiie 
northern alternating clusters of glacial and genial j^eriods during the 
latest high orbital eccentricity, or partly of the first of these or of a 
combination of both and of similar former vicissitudes. 

It seems established on paleontological evidence that in the Northern 
Hemisphere, during tlie early part of the Tertiary period, the climate 
was tropical in the middle of Europe, and that in the Miocene we have

ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND. 313 

this climate extendiug not only to the limits of the north temperate 
zone, but a luxuriant temperate tlora flourishing up to nearly 82° of 
north latitude. It seems diflicult, too, to believe, if we compare all the 
con/litions now existing at both poles under the present low eccentricity 
of the orbit, that such a genial climate as just described could have 
prevailed at so high a latitude, except under the conditions that would 
necessitate a glacial epoch at its antipodes. So that, if we accept the 
astronomical theory, we must believe that during the northern Miocene 
period there was a glacial epoch in the Southern Hemisphere, of which 
the rock striation and moraines in Africa, the moraines in Australia, 
Xew Zealand, and South America, may perhaps be the result. That 
there was at this time a force driving southern and tropical forms to the 
north is strongly corroborated by the distribiition of the fossil Sirenia 
(now, and probably always, exclusively confined to the Tropics) of 
which there are twelve genera and twenty-seven species ranging from 
the Tropics up to 00° of north latitude in the Eocene and Miocene of 
Europe, Asia, and Xorth America.^ The remains of southern forms of 
birds, such as parrots and trogons, not infrequent in the Oligocene and 
Miocene strata of Euro^ie may not unlikely have been migrants driven 
from the south before the same impelling force. That there has been 
such a northward migration is also evidenced by the occurrence of so 
many plants belonging to New Zealand, Australia, and some of the 
Antarctic islands isolated on the i^eaks of New Guinea and of Borneo. 
We must caution the reader, however, against supposing that the 
southern formations which have been named Eocene and Miocene, etc., 
are necessarily synchronous with those so named in the Northern 
Hemisphere. All that can be attirmed is that those systems which con- 
tain a similarity of succession of their fossils (especially their marine 
organic remains) are homotaxial — that is, the order in which they 
appeared on the earth has been similar. 

This much, however, may be accepted as mathematically demon- 
strated, that, during the glacial epoch of the Northern Hemisphere, 
while the high eccentricity of the earth's orbit lasted, there was an 
extremely genial age over the continent, the probability of whose exist- 
ence we have shown to be high, and that its fauna and flora, of which 
some examples have been cited, were eventually expelled from their 
southern i)aradise, on the passing away of the northern glacial epoch, 
by the slow increase of the southern cold, which has gradually reached 
to but no farther than its present condition toward glaciation, owing to 
the decrease of the eccentricity of the orbit and by the extensive sub- 
sidences of the land, due probably both to the ice accumulation round 
its pole and to the enormous amount of volcanic disturbance of which 
the whole region appears to have been the theater. 

Now, as to the explanation of these anomalies of distribution in the 
Southern Hemisi)here, the arrangement of land which I have outlined 

'Dr. H. Woodward, F. R. S., iu the Geological Magazine, page 423, 1885. 



314 ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND. 

above will, I tliiuk, account for them not less satisfactorily than tbat 
by an entirely northern center of dispersion. Mr. Wallace' holds that 
''the three most important south temperate land areas — south tem- 
perate America, South Africa, and Australia — have in all probabiHty 
always been as widely separated from each other ;is now," and "that 
it is unnecessary to suppose any land connection to explain the resem- 
blance between their aninml and vegetable inhabitants," as he !:ionsiders 
that the northern continuous land was the origin of them all, and that 
they sjpread meridianally south. That many forms of life did thus 
reach Notoga^a "under i^ressure" of glacial ej)ochs and "of more 
specialized types" it is impossible to doubt. But, as 1 have already 
remarked, this explanation will not account for marks of heredity seen 
in such southern groups as the piping crows of Australia and the den- 
drocolaptine birds of America, and the many other instances in tlie 
same category enumerated by Professor I'arker. That their original 
ancient progenitor may have come from the north is, of course, possible, 
but the characters that prove a common parentage — in forms now so 
diverse — could not have arisen in birds living so far apart as Australia 
and South America, without, I believe, a large common land area on 
which the progeny of the original parents could develop and spread 
over. 

Mr. Wallace believes also that the ancestral forms of the marsupials 
and monotremes reached West Australia (which for a long period in 
secondary and primary times was separated oft' as an island from East 
Australia, an arm of the sea uniting the Banda and the Antarctic seas) 
from the north, through Java and the intervening islands or land in 
that sea. Their fossil forms have, however, been chiefly found in East 
Australia, or if found in West Australia, they occur in strata certainly 
of no greater age. If such, indeed, were the route of their southward 
march, it is remarkable that througlumt the extensive regions over 
which they passed not a single individual has survived — not even in 
Timor, an island of like vegetation and climate to Australia, and that 
nearest to West Australia; while marsupials and monotremes are rep- 
resented abundantly on the northern and eastern Papuasian islands, 
with which West Australia, as IVfr. Wallace believes, was not at that 
period in connection. That these gi oups may have originated in Antarc- 
tica and spread into Australia via its Tasmanian peninsula, since fossils 
presenting many afiinities with the Australian forms have recently been 
discovered in Patagonia, appears to me a not less satisfactory explana- 
tion of their distribution. Their absence so far fi'om New Zealand is 
not more difficult to account for than their entire absence in the land 
which, according to Mr. Wallace, they traversed. Again, as regards the 
dispersal of the ancestors of the struthious birds, Mr. Wallace believes 
that they reached East Australia from New Guinea, with which it was 
united across Torres Strait; and that the emus, the cassowaries, the

ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND. 315 

IJromoniis, and the raoas are their desceudants. If the forms with a 
three-trochleaed metatarsus (from South America, Madagascar, aud 
Kew Zeahmd) had been developed on a southern land, they could, on 
their dispersal aud northern trek, have reached the region where they 
now are with as much ease as by the route supposed by Mr. Wallace. 

The earliest strata in which the fossil remains of both the Northern 
and Southern Hemisphere struthious birds have been found have been 
determined as Eocene, but whether these were really contemporaneous 
periods in the north and in the south, and which is the older, it is 
impossible to tell, so that their migrations may have been quite as 
likely from the south as from the north ; indeed, the struthious type of 
bird is, according to Professor Parker, essentially Notogfean, The 
African ostrich has been isolated from its congeners in the south for a 
long period of time through the disconnection of Africa from Antarc- 
tica, and has become specialized and lost its third metacarpal trochlea 
and the toe it carried. Since its isolation it has spread over Africa 
northward, but it once lived in Miocene times in Greece, in Persia, and 
in the Siwalik region of India, Again, in New Zealand and in East 
Australia we find a great similarity in the genera of their plants, 
while the species they possess in common are comparatively few, which 
is what might be expected in regions unconnected with each other 
except through a common land at some distance — the Antarctic conti- 
nent I have predicated, No other explanation except a common 
southern land will satisfy the distribution of the Aphanapteryx^ the blue 
water hens and the starlings of the Mascarene and the New Zealand 
regions — groups of birds which are unknown on the north side of the 
equator. 

As is well known, there live in the Galapagos Islands, on the equator, 
off the west coast of America, giant tortoises, of which one of the most 
remarkable facts about them is their zoological isolation. They have 
no relations with any of the forms of their own order on the neighboring 
continent. In several of the Mascarene Islands there lived when they 
were first visited by Europeans enormous numbers of equally giant 
tortoises — of which a few still survive — also in as complete isolation as 
the Galapagos species, for they can claim no relationship with the tor- 
toises of the nearest land, Africa. Yet, strange to say, the tortoises of 
Aldabra and Madagascar indicate the closest affinity with those of the 
Galapagos Islands. This extraordinary and seemingly inexjjlicable case 
of distribution receives, in my opinion, its easiest explanation by sup- 
posing that their ancestral home was in Antarctica, whence, forced by 
cold aud the submergence of the land south of them, they traveled 
north by diverging tracks, wandering, the one along the west coast of 
America and the other toward Lemuria, where, having reached islands 
without foes, they have prolonged their years beyond those of their 
fellows, which have died out everywhere else. 



316 ANTARCTICA: A VANISHED AUSTRAL LAND. 

It is not necessary to suppose — and, moreover, it is very improbable — 
that all these continental southernly peninsulas were contemi)ora- 
ueously connected with Antarctica. It is impossible otherwise to 
account for the presence, for instance, of the same South American 
forms in Australia and their absence in New Zealand; for Mascarene 
forms in the New Zealand rejjjion and not in Australia or Africa or 
elsewhere. So long as we are unacquainted with the orography of the 
submerged southern continent, with its mountain and river barriers, 
and the order of tlie making and breaking of its various commissures, 
we can hardly hope to account satisfactorily for all the anomalies of the 
southern distribution, none of which, however, are inexplicable when 
the inevitable elevations and subsidences due to the vast "physical dis- 
turbances, of which we have abundant evidence all over the region, are 
considered. 

Shortly, therefore, it is highly probable that an extensive continent 
existed in the Southern Hemisphere, on which many forms of terrestrial 
life originated and had there the original center of their development 
and dispersal; that Professor Huxley's division of the globe, according 
to the distribution of its life, into a northern and into a southern land 
must be accepted as its two primary biological divisions, from whose 
centers of development at both poles the wanderings of the fauna and 
flora were regulated by cold and warm jjeriods and by the elevation 
and flooding of one part of the continental plateau after another, and 
that from their advances and retreats across the ecpiator and their jour- 
neyings from east to west, according to the geographical features of 
the region and its meteorological conditions, on which their existence 
depends, resulted tlie present wonderful distribution of life on the 
globe which forii^s so fascinating a study to all who commence it. 



THE PROMOTION OF FURTHER DISCOVERY IN THE ARCTIC 
AND THE ANTARCTIC REGIONS.^ 



By Clements R. Maekham, C. B., F. R. S. 



In delivering ray anniversary address for tbe iirst time as your presi- 
dent, it is witli a feeling of iiiteuse satisfaction that I am able to do so 
after all old wounds have been permanently healed over, and after per- 
fect liarmony has been restored in the society. It was found last year 
that the rules did not all work so as to give complete satisfaction either 
to the council or to the rest of the fellows, and some deplorable friction 
was the result. This has now been remedied. The privileges and 
rights intended to be enjoyed by the fellows under the charter have 
been fully and clearly secured to them by the rules; all possibility of 
contentious discussion and debate has been entirely banished for the 
future frora our anniversary meetings; and special general meetings 
will not be called without more ample notice than has hitherto been 
given, while requisitions for them will be made, and resolutions will be 
passed by a more adequate number of fellows. These alterations in the 
rules were called for by the general sense of the lellows. They have 
removed all feeling of dissatisfaction that lingered amongst us. It will 
be my aim, as your president, to maintain the harmony which happily 
now exists by keeping the fellows acquainted with the decisions of the 
council affecting the well-being of the society, and by using every effort 
to prevent friction, and to promote, and if possible to increase, the 
interest taken in the society's work by the individuals who compose it. 

I have long entertained the idea that these desirable objects might 
be secured, among other ways, by a plan which, with nuich help and 
advice from members of the council and fron) the society's staff", is now 
nearly matured. I have drawn up a list of all the fellows who have 
written papers for our Proceedings or Journal, or have published books, 
or are known to have a si)ecial knowledge of one or more departments 
of our science, and to this list additions have been made by others. 
For the present I have called it a List of Referees, because papers or

questions can advantageously be referred for report to any of the fel- 
lows contained in the list, as regards their si^ecial subject or subjects. 
It is divided into two parts, the first being an alpliabetical list of names 
with the subjects respecting whicli each is an expert: and the second 
being arranged according to countries and subjects. It will be sent to 
many fellows of the society for suggestions and additions, and when tol- 
erably complete, it will probably-include several hundred names. Some 
fellows are collectors of geographical books or ma]>s. Others may have 
a profound knowledge of particular regions, or of special departments 
of our work, who have never i)nblished anything. The referees may 
have papers referred to them, may become members of committees on 
questions relating to their special subjects, and would, no doubt, be 
ready to give information and advice to inquiries, while the council will 
be mainly recruited from them. The existence, and eventual publication, 
of the List of Eeferees will be of use to the general body of fellows in 
various ways. Taking a more general interest in geographical subjects, 
the elders will thus be informed whither to go for information on points 
that occupy their attention, while it will be the ambition of the younger 
members to qualify themselves for inclusion in the list. In various 
ways I confidently hope that the plan will have the desired tendency 
of drawing the fellows more together, and into nearer touch with the 
council. 

Another measure, which I anticipate will have a similar effect, will 
be to offer more inducements to stu<ly and make use of the great store 
of geographical information in our library, by the completion of the 
catalogues, and by giving greater convenience and more comfort to 
readers. The present alphabetical catalogue was made in 18(ir), and 
there have been two sui)plements in 1870 and 1880. But in 1893 it was 
decided to recast the whole catalogue, including the three supplements 
(for a third up to 1890 had been prepared and was ready for printing), 
and to make one continuous alphabetical catalogue, printed in smaller 
type than ])reviously and in double column, and brought down to 1893. 
It is now all in print. There will be two appendices, the first contain- 
ing an alphabetical list of all the collections of voyages and travels, 
with an analytical table of contents to each volume, which is also in 
type. The second appendix is devoted to anonymous and ])eriodical 
literature arranged in geographical order. The catalogues have been 
made under the control and superintendence of Dr. Mill. The assistant 
in the library, Mr. Vincent Hawkins, deserves great credit for his 
industry and diligence, and Dr. Murie has now put the series of i)eriod- 
icalsinto perfect order, making a list of all deficiencies; but the second 
appendix is not yet finished. The authors' catalogue will, however, 
be in the hands of the fellows in the course of the present year. 

A subject catalogue was prepared by Mr. Godfrey Evans in 1871, and 
was extremely useful, but it now contains less than half the books in 
the library. In 1892 it was therefore resolved that a new and exhaustive 



PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 319 

subject catalogue sliould be prepared, and the services of Dr. Murie 
were secured, to work at it under tlie control of Dr. Mill. He bas since 
given the society the benefit of bis remarkably wide knowledge of 
geography and travel, and of his rare perseverance and organizing 
ability. The three essentials of this catalogue are that it is to be 
exhaustive, systematic, and exclusively geographical, many works in 
the library that are not geographical appearing only iu the authors 
catalogue. A subject catalogue fulfilling these conditions will be an 
invalual)le contril)ution to geography, serving as a guide to all workers 
in all parts of the Avorld, as well as rendering the contents of the library 
accessible to fellows. It involves enormous labor. All the titles of 
books and pamphlets iu the printed catalogues, numbering 18,000, have 
been cut out and classified; and all transactions and periodicals have 
been rearranged. Dr. Murie calculates that the number of titles of 
papers in periodicals will amount to 84,000; so that the complete cata- 
logue will comprise about 110,000 titles, occupying 5,000 octavo pages 
of print. Dr. Murie is now i)ut upon his metal to complete the work 
in not more than two years. 

Dr. Mill gave a new form to the bibliography in tlie Journal when it 
was commenced last year. It was made to include not only books and 
separate pamphlets, but all the longer geographical papers which 
appeared in the periodicals received in the library. Thus an analysis 
of current geographical work is presented each month. From these 
notices a subject card catalogue has been compiled since June, 1892, 
divided into continents and subdivided into countries and provinces, 
the arrangement being assisted by the use of differently colored cards. 
As it is kept up to date, this card catalogue forms an appendix to the 
great subject catalogue. 

As soon as the alphabetical catalogue is finished I intend to estab- 
lish two desiderata books — one for fellows to enter any book they may 
have asked for which is not in the library, and the other to contain a 
complete list of works which are wanting" to make our library perfect. 

I am very anxious that the accommodation for readers should be 
improved and that they should be made more comfortable, in order 
that their numbers may increase and that more use may be made of 
the library. Several suggestions have been made with this object in 
view from time to time, and now the question of either improving and 
enhirging the accommodation in our present house or of buying other 
premises is occupying the very serious attention of the council. 
Momentous financial and other questions are involved, and the subject 
is one which calls for most careful consideration. It will not be decided 
hurriedly, and no irremediable step will be taken without the consent 
of the fellows of the society assembled at a special general meeting. 
At the same time a final decision is rather pressing, as all the work is 
kept in an unsettled state until it is known whether we are to remainin 
our i)resent house or to go elsewhere. For instance, the press marking 



320 PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 

of the books in the libraiy can uot be proceeded with until it is known 
on what shelves they are to rest. The fellows may be assured that our 
deliberations will be full and mature, that we shall seek the best advice, 
and that our final decision on this subject will be the best that can be 
made under the very difficult circumstances, when there are so many 
things for and against any course we can adopt. 

The Geograpliical Journal in its present form has now completed 
the first eighteen months of its existence, and we may claim for it that 
it has more than fulfilled the expectations that M'ere entertained of it. 
We now receive every month the papers read at our evening meetings, 
with good and original maps, with the discussions and often with illus- 
trations, j)apers on scientific and on applied geography, carefully 
selected and classified notes on matters of general geographical inter- 
est, notices of the literature and cartography of the month, obituaries, 
and news. I find that already our Journal has attained a fair share of 
success. The sale to the outside public has increased considerably, 
and the importance of our publication may be gauged to some extent 
from the fact that the advertisements have increased from four to an 
average of twenty-two pages. This is important, because it helps the 
Journal in its new form to pay for the expense of its ])roduction. The 
fact that it is quoted everywhere, at home and abroad, may be taken 
as a sign that it has already been recognized as the leading organ of 
geograi)hy, at least in the English language. From the beginning it 
has been favorably noticed by the principal organs of the press. But 
I consider that the most gratifying testimony to the enterprise of our 
society in this and other directions is contained in a letter from the 
celebrated traveler and geographer. Baron von Richthofen. " Will you 
allow me," he wrote, "to make use of this op])ortunity for congratu- 
lating you on the excellent character of the Geographical Journal?" 
As far as our means permit, we shall endeavor to improve its character 
and attractions. We have subscribers outside the society in all parts 
of the world — in remote towns in the United States and in Australia — 
and steps will be taken to bring the Journal under the notice of hun- 
dreds likely to be interested in it, both in America and the Colonics. 
The size of our publication will probably have to be increased before 
long, for even with the extra pages which have been added our 
accomplished editor finds it increasingly difficult to keep pace with 
geographical activity in all departments aiul in all i)arts of the world. 

We thus have in our Journal every month a very complete review of 
geographical proceedings throughout the world, and every six months 
six Journals are presented to us with an index. The review of these 
proceedmgs which it has been customary for former presidents to give 
in their annual addresses, has therefore become unuecessarj^, for the 
fellows will already be in possession of such a review, and another 
recapitulation is neither useful as information nor serviceable for future 
reference. It is work already well done. It seems desirable, therefore,

as likely to be more interesting- to the fellows, that the main part of the 
address should in future dwell upon some particular subject, preferably 
one that has most engaged the attention of geographers during the 
past year. 

I freely acknowledge that the omission of a detailed review of the 
progress of geography will be quite a new departure, for such a review 
has annually been given since the foundation of the society. For many 
years it was essential, because the information could not be found else- 
where, and for a long time it was very useful; but as it has now become 
unnecessary, owing to the improved character of our Journal, the time 
for a change in the plan of the annual address seems to have arrived. 
During the first eight years of our existence the reviews of geographical 
progress were written by our indefatigable naval secretaries. Captains 
Maconochie and Washington ; but in 1838 my accomplished predeces- 
sor, Mr. W. E. Hamilton, introduced the practice of delivering annual 
presidential addresses, which has ever since prevailed. Since 1838 
there have been only three occasions on which the annual address has 
not been written and delivered by the president. In 1861 Sir Eoderick 
Murchison, as yice-president, delivered the address in the absence of 
Lord Ashburton; in 1879 I delivered the address as secretary, owing to 
the absence of Lord Dufterin; and the illness of Lord Aberdare made 
it necessary for General Strachey to deliver the address in 1886. It was 
the custom for the obituaries, which now appear in the different num- 
bers of the Journal, to be collected in the address, and there was a 
detailed review of work done during the year. I may observe that the 
address was always entitled "Address to the Royal Geographical 
Society by the president" from 1838 to 1878. In 1879 I prepared a 
statement of the progress of geography during the year in lieu of a 
president's address, and ever since my title has been adopted and the 
president's address has been called "The annual address on the progress 
of geography." But that title was not intended for the i)resident's 
address. I now propose to revert to the older and more convenient 
title, "Address to the society by the president," leaving eacli i)resideut 
freedom to choose his own subject-matter. 

For it was not the plan of Mr. Hamilton that the addresses should 
be confined to obituaries and reviews of current work, as has generally 
been the case in recent times. He and his immediate successors, while 
following the established practice, also dwelt upon some special subject 
in the body of tbeir addresses. In 1838 Mr. Hamilton discoursed on 
the importance of geography and on the uses of the society; and in 
1839 his great numismatic knowledge enabled him to ofl'er some most 
interesting suggestions respecting our medals. Mr. Greenough occujjied 
his address with a treatise on map drawing and an improved system of 
mapping. Admiral Smyth dwelt on the duties of the society, and on 
the definition and scope of geograj)hy. Sir Eoderick Murchison made 
it a regular practice to select some subject of interest as the principal

feature or kernel of his addresses. lu 1844 tliis was tbe Ural Mountains 
and the jiold produce of llussia. In 18515 he sketched out, with a 
master hand, the geographical features of the African continent. Ocean- 
ography, suggested by Maury's charming work, was the subject of Sir 
Eodcrick's address in 1853. In 1857 he stirred his audience to enthusi- 
asni by his advocacy of a final Arctic search ; and in the following year 
he dwelt on changes of the earth's surface. Earthquakes were his 
subject in 1859, the former condition of Europe in 1803, and glaciers in 
18G4. In 18G5 he reviewed the work remaining to be done in all parts 
of the world. The address of 18G7 was devoted to the Aralo-Caspian 
Basin, and Sir Roderick's later addresses were occupied with the con- 
nection of geography with geology. After Sir Ivoderick's time the 
practice of giving a kernel to the presidential addresses was aban- 
doned until, in 1888, General Strachey touched upon the legitimate 
limits of geography and, in 1889, on the occuftatiou of the waste spaces 
and on the supremacy of civilized races. 

The idea of devoting the bulk of the presidential address to one 
special subject of interest is not, therefore, an innovation, for it was the 
almost invariable practice of Sir Iloderick, and had been occasionally 
adopted before his time. As the ordinary subject of former addresses 
is now adequately provided for every month in the Journal, a mere 
recapitulation can serve no useful purpose. The fare that should now 
be served up to the fellows is a kernel in imitation of Sir lloderick's 
menu, with such garnishing as time and circumstance may suggest and 
as each president may think desirable. Such is my ideal of the pres- 
idential address of the future; but I am unable to entertain the hope 
that I can make even an a])proach to its realization. I will, however, 
take this opportunity of dwelling upon the subjects which have chiefly 
occupied geographers during the jjast year, namely, the promotion of 
further discovery both in the Arctic and the Antarctic regions. 

No less than six expeditions have either been projected or under- 
taken to explore different parts of the Arctic regions within the last 
two years, so that the subject has necessarily occupied a large share of 
our attention. It is one that has been before this society since its 
foundation, and some of the most important Government expeditions, 
including that of Sir George Nares in 1875, were due to the initiative 
of our council. In the long period, during which Arctic work has been 
over and over again under the special consideration of the council, and 
of committees appointed by it, consisting of men of science and of 
varied Arctic experience, distinct canons of exploration have been laid 
down, and opinions have been formulated which will certainly be useful 
for our guidance in the future. The council has always consistently 
maintained that merely to reach the Nortli Tole, or to attain a liigher 
latitude than someone else, were objects unworthy of support. In our 
view, the objects of Arctic exploration are to secure useful scientific 
results : In geography, by exploring the coast lines and interiors, and by

ascertaining the couclitious of land and sea within the nnknowu area; 
in geology, by observations and collections ; in zoology and botany ; and 
in physics, by a complete series of observations, extending over at least 
a year. I well remember that when, in 1874, we were i)reparing the 
memorandnm on the scientific results of Arctic work, General Strachey 
added another consideration. It may be shown, he said, that no such 
extent of unknown area, in any iDart of the world, ever failed to yield 
results of practical as well as of purely scientific value; and it may 
safely be urged that, as it is mathematically certain that the area exists, 
it is impossible that its examination can fail to add largely to the sum 
of human knowledge. 

The unknown area remains very much as it was left when these words 
were written in 1874, except that the expedition of Sir George Isares, 
in the two following years, discovered the trend of the land on the 
eastern and western sides of Robeson Channel, the great extent of the 
sea of ancient ice, and brought back valuable collections and observa- 
tions in all branches of science. We are still ignorant of the region to 
the north of Siberia. The northern, western, and eastern sides of the 
archipelago of Franz Josef Land have yet to be explored. The problem 
is still unsolved whether there is laud due north of Spitzbergen. We 
have yet to hear whether the outline of Greenland has been completed. 
EUesmere Land is almost entirely unknowu, as well as the important 
and interesting region leading from Jones Sound. The whole vast 
region between Prince Patrick Island and Siberia, the exploration of 
which will lead to such important results in physical geography, is also 
unknown. The whole of this work can only be accomplished gradually, 
and one expedition vrill have to follow another until all the knowledge 
attainable m this field of inquiry has been secured. 

For achieving success we have held certain canons, the correctness 
of which has been confirmed by all experience. It is true that they 
maybe neglected ou rare occasions without fatal consequences, but this 
can very seldom be done with impunity. The first great lesson taught 
by two centuries of experience is that no extensive and useful explor- 
ing work can be calculated upon by merely entering the drifting pack. 
Secui-e progress can only be made by following a coast line. The second 
canon is that at least one winter must be passed at a j)oint beyond any 
hitherto reached. This is essential in order to obtain series of meteor- 
ological and magnetic observations of any value. The third rule is 
that a shi]), not a hut on shore, must be looked upon as the proper 
base of operations, sledges being the main instruments for exploration 
and discovery. Thoroughly good work, including complete series of 
observations of all kinds, can only be secured by the ap])liances and 
resources of well-equipped Government expeditions. When the con- 
viction of the importance of that part of the duty of a Government is 
absent, which is unfortunately the case during long intervals, private 
enterprise has always been ready to enter the breach, though with 



324 PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 

inferior resources, and therefore at greater risk. The commander of an 
Arctic expedition onght to be a man of high scientific attainments, of 
great experience in the ice, and known to be gifted with the rare qnali- 
fications of a leader of men. Snch a commander is seldom to be found 
except in the service of a Government with a wide range of selection. 
When the circumstances and qualifications that we would desire to 
secure are unattainable, then we gladly welcome the nearest approach 
to them. Enterprise, however contrary to rule and however audacious, 
should ever be encouraged and cheered onward. When there are only 
small resources, risks must be run and attempts must be made which 
could not be approved under other circumstances. We shall always 
admire and applaud the enthusiasm and temerity of those who make 
attempts to open geographical secrets by private enterprise and with 
inadequate means. It is under such conditions that the projects have 
been conceived, and in some cases matured, which have engaged our 
attention in the Arctic regions during the last two years. The merit of 
the. work that may be achieved will be immensely enhanced by the 
special difficulties arising from different causes in each case, but all 
increasing the risk and the glory. 

In Nansen the expedition to the north of Siberia has the unusual 
advantage of having a commander of high scientific attainments, con- 
siderable Arctic experience, and the rare gift of inspiring confidence 
among his followers. As is well known, his guiding idea is that as all 
previous expeditions have been stopped by the ice drifting south, he 
would not be stopped if he entered the Arctic regions in the ice stream 
drifting north. He thus discards our chief Arctic canon, which is that 
j)rogress should always be made along a coast line; but the application 
of that rule has always been to ice drifting in a direction contrary to 
the course of the ship. It seems very doubtful whether the initial force 
of the current on the Siberian side of the Polar Sea will be sufficient to 
carry the Fram into the strong stream which undoubtedly flows south 
between Spitzbergen and (h-eenland. Her drift, however, maybe In 
the direction that is anticipated by her sanguine and very able com- 
mander, and it is almost certain that there is an ice-laden channel, 
unobstructed by extensive land. We have no intelligence of the expe- 
dition having reached the neighborhood of the mouth of tiie Lena, and 
it is possible that the Fram may have been beset in rounding Cape 
Chelyuskin, or even earlier. In that case it is likely that land will be 
discovered, which will certainly diminish the dangers of the jiack. 
Wilczek Land may extend for a great distance to the east. The water 
to the east and west of the most northern point of Siberia is deeper than 
that directly to the north, which seems to indicate the existence of land 
north of Cape Chelyuskin, and it is not unlikely that the Fram will have 
fallen in with it. In that case "N'ansen will doubtless seek its northern 
limit, and thence endeavor to get into the northerly drift. Under any 
circumstances, he is sure to accomx)lish a great deal of valuable scien- 



I

tific work, and to make imj)ortant discoveries. Of that we may be 
quite confident; and I am glad to think that Nansen concurs in the 
maxim of our council, that the priucii)al aim of Arctic voyages should 
be to explore the unknown regions, and not merely to reach the Pole. 
Lieutenant Weyprecht writes even more strongly. "The key to many 
secrets of nature," he says, "the search for which has now been carried 
on for centuries, is certainly to be sought for near the poles. But as 
long as polar expeditions are looked upon merely as a sort of interna- 
tional steeplechase, and their main object is to exceed by a few miles 
the latitude reached by a predecessor, those mysteries will remain 
unsolved." 

The scene of Weyprecht's scientific observations, and of Payer's 
interesting and ably conducted sledge Journey, was Franz Josef Land, 
which is certainly the most i^romising starting point for further discov- 
ery. This land, discovered by the Austrian expedition in 1872, consists 
of an archipelago, the southern shores of which are as far north as 80°, 
while the most northern land seen is in 83°. It will be remembered 
that Franz Josef Land consists, besides smaller islands, of two masses 
of land of sufficient extent to bear discharging glaciers sending forth 
flat-topped icebergs, which apparently drift northward. Between these 
two masses, called Zichy and Wilczek lands, is the channel named 
Austria Sound, which was explored for a considerable distance by 
Payer in the months of March and April, by means of sledges drawn 
by men, assisted by three dogs. All the low islands, as well as the 
main masses of laud, were found to be covered by glacial caps. The 
remarkable fact connected with this journey is that from Payer's 
farthest point in 82° 5' north a water sky made its appearance in the 
north, the temperature rose, and the rocks were covered with thou- 
sands of auks and guillemots. From a height Payer looked down 
on a dark sheet of open water dotted with icebergs. On April 12 the 
thermometer was at 54° F. These phenomena so early in the year are 
most exceptional, aiul point to an abnormal condition of things, the 
causes of which it would be of the utmost importance to discover. 
Possibly they betoken the navigability of the Polar Sea in this direc- 
tion at certain seasons, although it is true that Payer's open water 
was only a "polynia," and was surrounded by old ice. In 1880 Mr. 
Leigh Smith, in the Eira, reached the southern shore of Franz Josef 
Land, and succeeded in rounding the western headland, whence the 
land trended in a northwesterly direction. 

Judging from the birds and oi>en water in 82° north as early as the 
month of April, and from the success of Mr. Leigh Smith's voyage in 
1880, it was considered by all who were capable, from their Arctic experi- 
ence, of forming a judgment that the proper way to explore the north- 
ern part of the Franz Josef Archipelago would be by dispatching a 
well-equipped vessel along the western coast. It was the maxim of 
the Baffin Bay whalers to " stick to the land floe," and to this Sherard 



326 PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 

Osborn added, " Stick to the western shore," 1 strongly advocated the 
dispatch of such an expedition at a meeting of this society on Decem- 
ber 9, 1878, and my views were indorsed by several high Arctic authori 
ties. A vessel well handled would certainly reach the threshold of the 
unknown, and would probably establish a base on the west shore of 
King Oscar or of Petermann lands, whence extensive and most impor- 
tant discoveries would be made in the spring. This, no doubt, is the 
most promising way of attempting the exploration of one of the most 
important sections of the unknown polar region, and I believe that it 
will be undertaken the next time the British people wake up from their 
lethargy and become alive to the national importance of Arctic work. 
This happens about every thirty years. 

Meanwhile we welcome the enterprise of Mr. Harmsworth and Mr. 
F. G. Jackson, which is directed toward the Austria Sound of Payer. 
It is highly to the credit of Mr. Harmsworth that he should have 
determined to provide the funds for a laudable geographical under- 
taking. It reminds one of the patriotic muniticence of the merchant 
princes of old, and of Sir Felix Booth in more recent times. Mr. 
Jackson has made a voyage in a whaler, and last year he went out 
with Captain Wiggins to Waigats Island, where he was landed. He 
then made an excursion around the island with some Samoyeds, return- 
ing by Arcliangel; these sledge journeys being undertaken in order 
that he might acquire experience for his future work. His plan is to 
be landed at Eira Harbor, or at some other convenient point on the 
southern shore of the Franz Josef Archipelago. For this purjiose a 
whaler named the Windirard has been purchased. She will land the 
party of six men, and return without wintering. A house, brought out 
in pieces, will be erected, and the explorers Mill pass the winter in it 
in order to be ready for a spring journey up Austria Sound in the foot- 
steps of Payer. The chief drawback to the plan is that so much of 
the traveling will be over old ground already well explored by the 
Austrian expedition; so that the base of operations will be at least 
IGO, and if at Eira Harbor nearer 200, miles from the point rea(;hed by 
Payer, where Mr. Jackson's work will commence. It does not appear 
how a second winter quarters can be established, with a sufficient stock 
of provisions, at the forthest point reached. It will therefore be neces- 
sary to return to the original base of operations, and to start again 
over all the same ground, in the second spring. A well-considered 
system of dei)ots would render this secoiul journey more rapid if the 
explorers maintain their health, and with a good team of dogs much 
ground might be covered. The most fortunate thing that could hap- 
pen would be to find Austria Sound open, so that the Windivard or 
a steam pinnace could convey the explorers northward to within a 
shorter distance of their w^ork. Austria Sound is not the route I 
should have recommended for reacliing Petermann Land, but, with 
wise management and under favorable conditions of ice and weather, 



PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 327 

a good measure of success is quite possible. The couucil is desirous 
of giviug Mr. Jacksou all tlie eucouragement and assistauce in its 
power, and we lieartily wish him all the success that is attainable with 
the means at his disposal. 

Westward the archipelago of Spitzbergen ends in the parallel where 
that of Franz Josef commences. It has long been a favorite idea with 
inexperienced theorists, that the pole might be reached by a ship 
shaping a northern course through the ice to the north of Spitzbergen. 
This idea trangresses the best established of our Arctic canons, which 
is never to enter the drifting pack away from land. But it occurred to 
Sir Edward Parry that, although the impracticability of sailiu g to the pole 
by the Spitzbergen route was sufficiently proved, the same object might 
be attained by traveling with sledges over the ice. Parry undertook 
this feat in 1827 with two flat-bottomed boats 20 feet long, with run- 
ners on each side of the keels shod with metal, so that the boat entirely 
rested on the runners when on the ice, and became a sledge. They 
started with seventy-one days' provisions, and on June 23 tlie boats 
were hauled on the ice iu 81° 13' north. The weight of each boat with 
provisions was 3,753 i)ounds, or 2G8 pounds per man, there being twelve 
men and two officers for each boat. The ice floes were found to be of 
small extent and intersected by high ridges of hummocks, the snow 
was soft and heavy, and there was much water lodged on the floes; 
but the southerly drift exceeded 4 miles a day. The advance north 
under such circumstances was liopeless, and Parry resolved to retrace 
his steps on July 23, when he was in 82° 45' north. From this point 
there was a strong yellow ice blink overspreading the northern horizon 
and showing that the polar pack extended far to the northward. 
Parry's great mistake was in starting so late in the year, lie ought to 
have been at least two months earlier. The daily allowance of food 
was insufficient, and the weight to be dragged, of 208 pounds per man, 
was f\ir too great. 

Undoubtedly, if these errors were avoided, a much farther advance 
to the northward might be made under favorable circumstances. The 
object of such an expedition would be to get farther north than any- 
body else — "to beat the best record" — a motive which was so earnestly 
deprecated by Lieutenant Weyprecht as the bane of good Arctic 
work. Still, it is a sporting thing to attempt, alid as those who are 
engaged in it will acquire valuable experience iu the ice, it deserves 
every encouragement. Mr. Walter Wellman, a journalist of Washington 
City, with funds amounting to £4,000, has undertaken to make a renewed 
attempt to attain a very high latitude north of Spitzbergen, and has 
already started on his adventurous undertaking, with a few carefully 
chosen assistants. He is a capable and resolute man, and a thoroughly 
well-planned effort will be made under his auspices. He will land on 
Danes Island, near the northeast angle of Spitzbergen, m the present 
month. Thence he will push northward in aluminium boats of a new 



328 PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 

design, constructed at Baltimore, and weighing only 450 pounds each. 
The boats are 18 feet long, 6 in beam, and 2 feet deep amidships, and 
are intended for a crew of nineteen men. They contain no frames, the 
gunwale, thwarts, knee braces, and water-tight compartments at either 
end giving the necessary rigidity; but too much rigidity is undesirable, 
elasticity serving to cushion ■ the blows of the ice and to transmit 
the force of the concussion through the whole structure. The keel is a 
plate of aluminium, and the plates are riveted together clinker fashion, 
and are only a tenth of an inch thick. Two ash runners are fitted on 
the boat's bottom, so as to convert it into a sledge, and a sheet of alu- 
minium is riveted to the outer sides of both, so as to form a broad sur- 
face for running on the snow or ice. It is donbtfnl how this kind of 
runner will work, but the lightness of the boats will be an incalculable 
advantage, and Mr. Wellman ought to advance far beyond I'arry, 
especially if the dogs prove to be of use. If there are islands beyond 
83° north on the Spitzbergen meridians, and he is able to explore them, 
his expedition will be of great service to geography; but if not, very 
little benefit can be derived from a journey over the ice floes in Parry's 
footsteps. 

The enterprise of Lieut. Robert E. Peary in northern Greenland is of 
the greatest geogra])hical importance. It is designed to solve the ques- 
tion of the insularity of Greenland, one of the oldest that remains for 
solution, and not the least interesting. It is a great achievement to 
put the finishing touch to the long tale of heroism and constancy which 
relates the discovery of the outline of that vast glacier-bearing island. 
The romantic story of the Norsemen is succeeded by the splendid work 
of Davis and BaflBn, followed by the voyages of Ross, Inglefield, Kane, 
Hayes, Hall, and Nares, and by the sledge journeys of Beaumont and 
Lockwood. These dauntless explorers completed what we know of the 
western side. On the east side the boat journeys of Graali, Holm, 
and Ryder have been connected with the discoveries of Scoresby and 
Clavering, and the German expedition of Koldewey named the most 
northern point they saw on the east coast after Prince Bismarck. It is 
Peary's noble ambition to connect Cape Bismarck with the farthest 
point reached by Lockwood; and he resolved to make the attempt from 
the western side by one of the most remarkable, if not the most 
remarkable, journeys" ever made over an unbroken glacier. 

Peary is a native of Maine, aged about 40, and an engineer in the 
United States Navy. He is a man who appears to be cut out for sucli 
work, combining forethought and ]n-udence in planning his operations 
with great skill and the most undaunted resolution in carrying them 
into execution. His first expedition in 1891-U2 was tentative, but it 
was a great success. He went out in the whaler Kite, and was landed 
in McCormick Bay in 77° 43' north, on the northern side of Inglefield 
Gulf (the Whale Sound of Battin), the party consisting of seven persons, 
including Mrs. Peary. Peary had his leg broken during the voyage, 



PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 329 

and was in a helpless conditiou wheu lie was landed. His comj)lete 
recovery was due in no small degree to tlie unremitting care of Ins wife. 
We must all feel the greatest admiration for the devotion of this lady, 
who braved the rigors of the Arctic regions, and was not only ihe life 
and soul of the winter quarters, but was throughout a most useful mem- 
ber of the expedition. The house was conceived and erected in a work- 
manlike manner, and in all Peary's operations there is the evidence of 
capacity and skill. He studied the questions of clothing, of provisions, 
and of sledge weights with great care and good working results. He 
also tried the different kinds of sledges before finally deciding that 
McOlintock's pattern was the best. His journey occupied eighty- three 
days, from May 15 to August 6. The start was made with four sledges, 
four men, and dog teams, the depot sledge with two men returning from 
Humboldt (ilacier. Peary, with his companion Astrup, i)roceeded with 
three sledges and the dogs, and was traveling forty-eight days before 
reaching the northern edge of the great glacier, the actual marching 
time being forty days, and the distance covered 650 miles, or 16;^ miles 
a day. They had no depots, and all the food was carried on the sledges, 
except two musk oxen and a calf shot on the northeast coast. The 
return journey of 600 miles occupied only twenty-eight days. Peary 
started with twenty dogs, reached his extreme point with fifteen, and 
returned with five. A good Eskimo dog will drag 100 pounds at the 
rate of 10 to 20 miles a day. 

It was found that in a[)proacliing the edge of the glacier toward the 
north the travelers got involved among numerous crevasses, causing 
endless trouble to circumvent them, so that it was advisable to keep 
on the plateau of the glacier. He reached the northeast coast of Green- 
laud at a place which he named Independence Bay; and from the height 
called Xavy Cliff he obtained an extensive view of lauds to the north- 
ward with no ice caps, and therefore probably islands. 

Peary returned home in Sei^tember, 1892, and earned sufficient fands 
for his second expedition by means of lectures and articles for the 
press. He had made a very thorough reconnoissance in 1891-92, by 
which he had tested all his equipments and got well acquainted with 
the nature of the country. He now resolved to proceed upon his final 
effort to complete the work he had set himself to achieve. He sailed 
in Jul3% 1893, with a party numbering fourteen, including Mrs. Peary 
and her maid, with the intention of erecting the house in Bowdoin Bay, 
on the shores of Whale Sound. Peary's intention was to commence 
sledging operations in March, two months earlier than in 1892, and to 
make for Independence Bay by a route between the previous outward 
and return routes, so as to avoid the crevasses of the northwest and 
the fogs of the higher plateau. Eight Mexican donkeys have been 
taken as an experiment and fitted with snowshoes, as has been done 
with horses in Alaska. On reaching Independence Bay it is intended 
to send one party southward to Cape Bismarck and the other north- 



330 PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 

ward to connect with Lockwood's farthest. But it appears that Peary 
is also bitten with the "beating the best record" mania, and thinks of 
pushing due north with the object of reaching the highest latitude 
attainable. It is to be hoped that this fancy will not be allowed to mar 
the real work of the expedition, which is to complete the outline of 
Greenland. 

Mr. Peary is again accompanied by the hardy young N^orwegian? 
Eivind Astrup, who was with him throughout his first journey. 

Tlie Falcon steamer is to sail next June and proceed to Peary's quar- 
ters in Whale Sound: but it is not certain whether he will return or 
resolve to continue his work during another year. His, decision will 
probably depend on the extent of his explorations this year and on the 
amount of work he Avill have completed. We shall all look out for the 
X)articulars of his achievement with the deepest interest. For my own 
part, I look upon Peary as an ideal explorer. He chose one of the 
greatest and oldest of the geographical i)roblems tliat remain to be 
solved, and he set to work as if he really intended to find the solution. 
Every detail of equipment was thoughtfully considered, gear was tried 
and tested before being used, a brilliant preliminary journey over the 
inland ice was made. All was done in the workmanlike style of a true 
discoverer. I therefore believe that Peary will succeed. I am sure that 
he deserves success. 

I now come to the saddest part of my Arctic story. Next to northern 
Greenland, the most interesting part of the unknown region is the land 
on the western side of the north part of Baffin Bay, between Smith 
Sound and Jones Sound, and extending along the north side of Jones 
Sound to the west and north. It was named Ellesmere Land by Sir 
Edward Inglefield, who saw it from the deck of the Isabella in 1852. It 
is called Umiug-mak (the land of the musk oxen) by the Eskimos. No 
one, so far as we know, has ever landed between Jones Sound and 
Smith Sound." But in August, 1851, the Intrepid and Pio»eer went up 
Jones Sound for 40 miles, and Sherard Osborn gave a very interesting 
account of tlie cruise. Two of his officers landed on a small island at 
their farthest i^oint. and found Eskimo remains, abundance of vegeta- 
tion, and some reindeer antlers. In the following year Sir E. Inglefield 
entered the sound in bad weather, but did not effect a landing. This 
is all we know of Ellesmere Land south of Smith Sound. 

The absence of knowledge respecting Ellesmere Land, and the cora- 
liarative ease with which its eastern coast may be reached, induced an 
accomplished and adventurous young Swede, named Alfred Bjorlmg, 
to turn his attention to its exploration. His original plan was to pro- 
ceed up Baffin Bay in a St. John's whaler, and to land as near as pos- 
sible to Cape Sabine, within Smith Sound. During the next ten weeks 
he proposed to travel by boat and sledge through Hayes Sound 
toward the Victoria Archipelago, or North Kent. Bjorliug is a bota- 
nist, and he believed that this region, while quite unknown geograph- 



PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 331 

ically, would offer an exceptionally ricli field for botanical researches, 
because its position makes it a connecting link between Greenland and 
Arctic xVmerica. His return journey was to liave been directed either 
to Cape Warrender or along tlie east coast of Ellesmere Land to a spot 
wliere lie could be picked up by a returning- whaler. 

This was a well-conceived ])lan, provided that proper arrangements 
were made with a whaler. There is no reason why geographers and 
naturalists should not spend ten weeks of the summer on such useful 
work, if properly equipped, and if a vessel will engage to call for them 
before returning home, at a prearranged spot. Ujorling received a 
grant from the Vega exploring fund and the proceeds of subscriptions, 
and left Stockholm in the spring of 1892. 

Alfred Bjcirling was born in 1871, and always cherished an ardent 
desire to make discoveries in the Arctic regions. In order to i)repare 
himself for this work, he wandered through extensive tracts of the 
mountainous region of northern Scandinavia during 1887 and 1888, and 
he was the first to ascend the peak of Kebnekaisse, the highest mftun- 
taiu m Sweden. In the summer of 1890 he accompanied a Swedish 
expedition to the west coast of Spitzbergen, made valuable collections 
of Arctic plants, and assisted in the hydrographical and topographical 
work. In the following year Bjorling went to Greenland in one of the 
Danish vessels, and from Upernavik he made a voyage with Eskimos 
in an umiak along the coast of Melville Bay inshore, as far northward 
as the Devil's Thumb. He returned to Sweden in the aiitumn. 

Bjorling was only 21 years of age when he became the leader of the 
Ellesmere Land expedition. His companion, Evald Gustaf Kallstenius, 
was born in 18G8, and since 1886 he had been a student of zoology at 
the University of LIpsala, but he had not been in the Arctic regions 
before. The two young explorers did not succeed in making an arrange- 
ment with a whaler at St. Johns, Newfoundland, and, after much diffi- 
culty, Bjorling bought a small schooner of 37 tons, called the Ripple^ 
for $650. He succeeded in persuading three men to form a crew, with 
himself and his companion. A Dane named Karl Kann entered as 
skipper, an Eniilishman named Gilbert Dunn formed the crew, and the 
cook was a North Briton, named Herbert Macdonald. Owing to the 
long delay in getting the Ripple ready for sea. Cape Walsingham was 
not sighted untd July 24, and on the 28th she arrived at Godhavn, 
having behaved very well in the ice of Dans Strait. Bjorling purchased 
at Godhavn a fowling x)iece and a rifle with ammunition, some provi- 
sions and clothes, and a boat. He was provided, before leaving Stock- 
holm, with scientific instruments. He left Godhavn on August 3. 

Some anxiety for the gallant young Swedes began to be felt when 
Lieutenant Peary started on his second expedition last July, and he 
was requested to obtain information respecting their proceedings, and if 
necessary to go to their relief. In November, 1893, the whaler Aurora 
returned from BafSn Bay with a report of the loss of the Ripple. On 



332 PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 

June 17, 1893, the Aurora was in tlie north water of Baffin Bay, and 
sighted a wreck on the most southeastern of the Gary Islands. A boat 
was sent on shore, and the schooner Ripple was found driven on the 
beacli, and almost buried in ice. Not far from the wreck there was a 
heap of stones covering the dead body of a man, probably the Dane, 
Karl Kaun. Close by there was a large cairn, in which a tin pot was 
found, containing open letters from Bjorling. It appears that he 
reached the Cary Islands on August IC, 1892, so that the voyage from 
Godhavn occupied a fortnight, and he crossed Melville Bay in a single 
day. On the following day the Ripple was driven on shore while they 
were engaged in taking provisions on board from the depot of Sir 
George Nares, apparently with the intention of wintering on the coast 
of Ellesmere Land. Up to this time all appears to have gone well, but 
the unforeseen calamity of the loss of their vessel must have destroyed 
all their antici]>ations of success. They were obliged to remain several 
weeks at the Cary Islands owing to bad weather; but eventually Bjorl- 
ing* resolved to undertake the voyage to Cai^e Clarence or Cape 
Faraday on the western side of Baffin Bay, in an open boat, buoyed 
with the hope of meeting Eskimos. In his letter he said that he hoped 
a whaler would visit the Cary Islands in the following summer, and 
that he would consequently try to return with his people by July 1, 
1893. He added, addressing the captain of the supposed whaler, " I 
shall be very much obliged to you if you would go to Clarence Head 
(50 miles oft"), where I shall leave in a cairn information relative to our 
fate during the winter. Our provisions, if I can not find Eskimos, will 
not last beyond January 1. We are now five men, of whom one is 
dying." The date is October 12, 1892. The Aurora found that Clar- 
ence Head could not be approached in June within 20 miles, and she 
made no further attempt to comply with Bjiirling's request later in the 
season. 

The conduct of the two heroic lads was admirable throughout. There 
was the usual risk and danger of Arctic work in their project, but no 
more, before they lost their vessel. Their message is most touching. 
Not a sign of fear, not a word of complaint, but the simple words of 
brave men, most pathetic in their simplicity. There is one circumstance 
which is worthy of notice. The eastern side of Baffin Bay is within 20 
miles of the Cary Islands, and friendly Eskimos are well known to have 
settlements there. Yet Bjorling and Kallstenius chose to go in an open 
boat to the northern side, which is 50 miles oft", and where the presence 
of Eskimos was uncertain. There can only be one reason. The west- 
ern side was Ellesmere Land, the appointed place of their work, and 
even in their dire extremity they resolved to go whither duty pointed. 
It was not foolhardiness, nor thoughtless enthusiasm, but a sense of 
duty, which pointed the way. One of the most experienced of our 
Arctic officers thus wrote on the subject: "It is evident that Bjorling 
must have had good sterling qualities, to induce two Englishmen to 



PKOMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 333 

throw in their lot with him. As they could have left him at the Danish 
settlements, it would appear as if he was a boru leader, and might have 
become a great man if he had had patience to wait until he had gained 
experience. However, very little would be done in the world without 
the enthusiasm of youth. The experience of age can not be combined 
with it, so that the latter will never have all the say. Yet a good 
many victims is the result, and in this case that result is much to be 
deplored." 

When the news brought back by the Aurora reached Sweden there 
was an idea of a relief expedition. But in the end of 1893 a circu- 
lar from Mr. Eobert Stein, who is connected with the United States 
Geological Survey Office at Washington, announced his scheme for 
exploring the whole i^olar area, and for reaching the pole by a system 
of gradual approaches. He proposed to establish a station, to serve as 
a permanent base of operations, at Cape Tennyson, on tiie northern 
shore of Jones Sound. Elere he intended to place fifteen men always 
provisioned for two years. Thence he would push forward secondary 
stations into the unknown area, each with five men. Mr. Stein intended 
to form the first station in Jones Sonnd, and he also undertook to con- 
duct a search for the relief of the missing Swedisli explorers. Baron 
Nordenskiold promised a subscrii)tion of i2,()()() in consequence, and 
the importance of the Stein expedition was very much enhanced. 
Funds were, however, much needed. I therefore made an appeal for 
subscriptions in the Times, on April 7. But immediately afterwards I 
was amazed to hear tliat Mr. Stein had postponed his expedition for 
another year. ""' 

I nevertheless opened a ^'Bjorling relief fund," and subscriptions 
were received at the society's rooms with the object of assisting Baron 
Nordeuskjold in any measures he might adopt for the relief of his gal- 
lant young countrymen. At our meeting on April 9 I made an urgent 
appeal to the fellows for subscriptions. Several came forward, includ- 
ing many Arctic officers, who are never deaf to such appeals, and I am 
happy to say that I have been enabled to forward the sum of £84 10s. 
to Baron Nordenskjold at Stockholm. But the abandonment of his 
design by Mr. Stein has left but little time for other measures to be 
matured. Mr. Nilsou has been sent out in the whaler Eclipse from 
Dundee in the hope of reaching Clarence Head; and Dr. Ohlin, with 
the same object, has proceeded to St. Johns, Newfoundland, whence he 
is to go to Baffin Bay in June, on board the Falcon^ the steamer that 
is to bring back Peary's party. 

These arrangements may suffice if the only object is to ascertain the 
fate of the lost exj^lorers, but if their relief and rescue are intended, 
it is necessary to dispatch a special steamer for the purpose. A vessel 
engaged in other work, such as whale fishing or attendance on the 
Peary expedition, might be induced to touch at Clarence Head, but she 
might not be able to reach the shore during the time she could allow 



334 PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 

for that object, and she conld not wait beyond a certain time. But a 
vessel sent for the relief service alone would wait for opportunities, and 
make a thorough and efticient search. It therefore becomes necessary 
to consider whether the sad duty of ascertaining the fate of those gal- 
lant youths, and their companions, alone remains; or whether there is 
any hope of their having survived. 

If Bjorling fell in with a party of friendly Eskimos, there is no reason 
why he and his companions should not have survived through two 
winters, if animal life were abundant around their encampment. This, 
therefore, is the question, whether there is a reasonable probability of 
Eskimos being met with near Clarence Head, Many years ago, when 
I was serving in the Arctic regions, it was assumed that the western 
side of Baffin Bay, north of Lancaster Sound, was uninhabited. In 
1851 Sherard Osborn found vestiges of Eskimos in Jones Sound, and 
when I landed near Cape Warrender, with Sir Erasmus Oumianney, in 
the i)revious year, I came upon several stone graves. It was supiwsed 
that these remains were very ancient, possibly representing- the origi- 
nal migration of the people now settled in northern Greenland. But 
in 1853 Sir Edward Ingletield found a party of Eskimos in the very 
harbor where I had lauded in 1850, proving that, though wanderers 
had left their vestiges in the remote past, people of the same race still 
frequented the region in question. Their remains were also found by 
the exi:)edition of Sir George Xares on the western side of Smith Sound. 
Captain Buddington, who commanded the Folaris expedition after 
Hall's death, met with Eskimos at Port Foulke who had certainly 
waudered round the whole northwestern side of Baffin Bay from Lan- 
caster Sound. The information collected by Dr. Franz Boas from the 
Eskimos in Baffin Land is more detailed. They occasionallj^ cross 
Lancaster Sound from Admiralty Inlet to the neighborhood of Cape 
Warrender, but not often, because they have no boats or canoes, and 
the sound is seldom frozen over. On reaching the coast of jSTorth 
Devon, they go across the land with their sledges, and in four days 
reach the coast of Jones Sound, at a place where a long narrow jjrom- 
ontory juts out toward EUesmere Laud called Xedlung. The promon- 
tory becomes an island at high tide, and there is a channel of open 
water throughout the winter. In the spring this becomes a large 
open space clear of ice, frequented by enormous quantities of seals. 
Farther north, on the coast of EUesmere Land, which abounds in rein- 
deer and musk oxen, there was another small colony of Eskimos. 
These facts are certainly encouraging. I>J(irling would not have 
landed at Clarence Head until the middle of October, which is against 
his chances; but on the other liand, he would not then be more than 
10 or V2 miles from the Eskimos, if they were still in EUesmere Land. 

On the whole there is ground for hope; and it is discreditable to 
abandon the unfortunate explorers to their fate. The two Swedish 
lads are the stuff of which heroes are made, and every civilized i)eople 



PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 335 

must be interested in their rescue. British subjects are with them, 
whom we are bound to befriend. Most certainly a special steamer ought 
to be dispatched for their relief. But the time is very short. Hundreds 
would gladly subscribe their mites, and the funds could have been 
raised if there had been a year or so to collect it in. But there is 
barely a month. The only hope was that a few very rich people might 
be induced to come forward and save the credit of their country. I 
felt very strongly that a vessel ought to be dispatched, and I therefore 
made every effort, and left no stone unturned to obtain the necessary 
funds. But I am sorry to say that I was not successful. Our sole hope 
is now in the efitbrts of Mr. Nilson on board the whaler Eclipse, and of 
those in the Falcon. The Falcon will sail from St. Johns early in July, 
under the command of Mr. Henry G. Bryant, the recording secretary 
of the Geographical Club of Philadelphia. It is hoped that Peary's 
headquarters at Bowdoin Bay will be reached by July 25, but as Peary 
and his inland party will not then have returned, the Falcon will have 
about a month to spare for an independent cruise, before embarking 
the Peary expedition in the first days of September. In a letter I have 
just received from Mr. Bryant he assures me that he takes a deep inter- 
est in the fate of the young Swedes, and his plan includes a landing at 
Clarence Head and other points, and a search for records left by Bjorl- 
ing and Kallstenius. Mr. Bryant also contemplates the exploration of 
the channel leading west from Jones Sound. 1 have only just received 
these jiarticulars from Mr. Bryant, which iDlace the chances of relief for 
the missing explorers in a brighter light. I heartily wish all possible 
success to the Peary auxiliary expedition and its gallant leader. Dr. 
F. A. Cooke, who was with Peary in 1891-92, proposes to go up Baffin 
Bay with a party of excursionists on board the steamer Neicfoundland, 
owned and commanded by Capt. J. A. Farquhar, leaving New York on 
June 25, and intending to return on September 10. Perhaps Captain 
Farquhar may be induced to visit Clarence Head. 

I must take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to Mr. Trevor- 
Battye for his enthusiastic efitbrts to promote the dispatch of a relief 
vessel; as well as to Captain Haserick and to Mr. William Pine Coffin, 
who both felt deeply the shame of leaving the gallant explorers to their 
tate, and were ready to hel]), and did help, with the utmost zeal and 
ardor in so good a cause. Mr. Trevor-Battye, failing the relief expedi- 
tion, is about to start in the steamer Sajcon, of 150 tons, in company with 
]Mr. Mervyn Powys, to make a thorough ornithological as well as geo- 
graphical examination of the little-known Kolguev Island, I believe 
under Lord Lilford's auspices. Mr. Trevor-Battye has studied under 
Mr. Coles, and the council has granted him the loan of instruments 
necessary for navigation. To my mind Mr. Trevor-Battye is cut out 
for a successful exjdorer. A hunter of elk on ski in Sweden, of moose 
and wapiti in the Eockies, a salmon fisherman in the Far West, of pow- 
erful physique and great powers of endurance, he is also a naturalist, 



336 PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 

an artist, and an accomi^lished author. Tt is to the training and encour- 
agement of such men that the society must look, if we are to have great 
travelers in the future to advance our science and to do honor to our 
country. 

Circumstances have obliged us to pay very special attention to Arctic 
questions in the past year; but the great meeting wliich assembled to 
hear Dr. Murray's pajier, on the 27th of last November, is onr witness 
that the Antarctic regions have not been forgotten. All the scientific 
societies in the United Kingdom and on the Continent are now of one 
mind as to the importance of Antarctic exploration, and they are con- 
vinced that it must be a Government undertaking. It is half a century 
since Sir James Eoss returned, and the time has come for renewing the 
work which he commenced so admirably. The arguments of Dr. Murray 
must have brought conviction to the minds of all who had not previously 
studied the subject. An expedition is necessary for magnetic observa- 
tions alone. I'rofessor jSTeumayer Avrote to Dr. Murray that " it is certain 
that without au examination and a survey of the magnetic jiroperties of 
the Antarctic regions, it is utterly hopeless to strive, with prospects of 
success, at the advancement of the theory of the earth's magnetism." 
Dr. Murray thus summed up the work of a modern Antarctic exijcdition : 
" To determine the nature and extent of the Antarctic continent, to pene- 
trate into the interior, to ascertain the depth and nature of the ice cap, 
to observe the character of the underlying rocks and their fossils, to 
take magnetic and meteorological observations both at sea and on land, 
to observe the temperature of the ocean at all depths and seasons of the 
year, to take x>endulum observations on land, to bore through the 
deposits on the floor of the ocean at certain points to ascertain the con- 
dition of the deeper layers, and to sound, trawl, dredge, and study the 
character and distribution of marine organisms." All these observations 
are earnestly demanded by the science of our day for many purj^oses. 
Science demands a steady, continuous, laborious, and systematic explora- 
tion of the whole southern region with all the appliances of the modern 
investigator. 

Enlightened by the exhaustive and most interesting paper of Dr. 
Murray, and encouraged alike by his enthusiasm and by the sound 
sense of his remarks in favor of the renewal of Antarctic exploration, 
our council appointed a committee with instructions to report upon the 
best means of achieving the objects set forth by Dr. Murray. Our 
Antarctic committee consisted of Sir Joseph Hooker, one of the two 
survivors of Sir James Boss's expedition; of Sir George Nares, the 
only living naval captain who has navigated the Antarctic Ocean; of 
Captain Wharton, the hydrographer; of Admiral Sir Erasmus Omman- 
ney, who has long been a warm advocate of such an enterprise; of 
Admiral Sir R. Yesey Hamilton, one of our best Arctic authorities, who 
has also written on the subject of Antarctic navigation of Dr. Murray 
and myself. 



PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 337 

The committee in its report enumerated the scientific results of 
Antarctic research, especially dwelling" on the necessity for an accurate 
study of terrestrial magnetism. The experiences of early navigators 
in approaching the pack edge are then reviewed, and it is shown that 
Sir James Ross alone boldly entered it, with a view to passing- through 
it, on two occasions, with success. In Jannary, 1841, he forced his way 
through it in four days, reaching an open sea, discovering Victoria 
Laud, and penetrating to the seventy-eighth parallel. On the second 
occasion he entered a i)ack several hundreds of miles in width, and he 
was forty-two days getting through, but he again succeeded. In 1843, 
on his third attempt, it was too late in the season when he entered the 
pack, and the young ice was forming rapidly. If it had been Decem- 
ber instead of March he might have ett'ected more. The committee 
then contrasts the conditions of navigation in the Arctic and Antarctic 
regions. In the north there are lields of ice of vast extent, often fixed 
for months in one i>lace by intricate channels. The danger of long 
detention, arising from being beset in such ice, is not so serious in the 
Antarctic regions. But there are other dangers which are equally for- 
midable. In gales of wind and in fogs, and even in calms, sailing ves- 
sels are in much danger, when involved in the pack, from the swell 
caused by heavy gales, and when it is impossible to avoid collisions 
with huge masses of ice. On such occasions a sailing vessel is helpless. 

But as screw steamers would, of course, be employed on any new 
Antarctic expedition, these dangers would be very much reduced and 
a great saving of time would be effected. Calms occur, and there are 
often adverse winds when there is clear weather. At such times sail- 
ing vessels would be beating up 20 miles while a steamer might make 
100. With steam it might be possible to do in one season all that 
which, in the cases of Wilkes and Boss, occupied three. A steamer 
would be in little danger from bergs except in fogs, and in heavy gales 
she could lie to in safety under their lee, instead of drifting at the 
mercy of wind and waves. She would also be better able than a sailing- 
vessel to double the pack. The weak point of a steamer in the pack 
M^ould be during a gale of wind. She might avoid collision with the 
ice better than a sailing vessel, but not altogether. But specially 
adapted screw steamers would no doubt facilitate Antarctic naviga- 
tion, and remove many of the dit'licnlties which had to be encountered 
by sailing vessels. 

Having fully considered the exigencies of Antarctic navigation, the 
committee recommend that the ex])edition should consist of two vessels 
as well strengtheued against the ice as were the Erebus and Terror, 
fitted with steam power, and specially protected aft. It is indispensa- 
ble that officers and crew^s should be under naval discipline, and a full 
commission of three years would be necessary for the performance of 
the work. Aj^art from the valuable scientific results of an Antarctic 
expedition, the committee dwell u^ion the excellent effect that all such 
SM 94 22 



338 PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 

undertakings, in which our country has been prominent, have invari- 
ably had on the navy, by maintaining the spirit of enterprise. 

Having been adopted by our council, the report of our Antarctic 
committee, together with Dr. Murray's paper, was transmitted to the 
Royal Society, with an urgent request that that learned body would 
take the subject of the renewal of Antarctic discovery into serious 
consideration, with a view to its being brought before Her Majesty's 
Government in a memorial j^resented. by the Royal Society, with the 
cordial assent of every scientilic body in the United Kingdom. I 
understand that a committee has been appointed by the council of the 
Royal Society, and that the important question is receiving mature 
and careful consideration. The fellows may rest assured that no efforts 
on the part of our council will be wanting, and that the duty of pro-, 
moting the renewal of Antarctic exploration will be borne in mind. 
If men of science are unanimous, both as to the importance of the 
work and the best method of executing it, and if they are backed by 
enlightened public opinion, the Admiralty will be only too glad to take 
the subject into favorable consideration, and difiQculties raised by the 
treasury will be overcome. But unanimity and the sui)port of i)ublic 
opinion are absolutely essential to success. 

I have devoted the body of my address to work within the polar 
regions. I will not, however, omit to refer to the labors of others in 
regions which, through their exertions, may become the main subjects 
of future addresses. You have recently heard an account of the results 
of the journey of Mr. and ]\rrs. Littledale, which are in many respects 
remarkable. It was a very hazardous adventure; it covered several 
hundreds of miles of entirely new ground, and very careful observa- 
tions were taken all along the route, which have been embodied in a 
valuable map. The additions made by Mr. Littledale to our knowledge 
of the famous route to China followed by Marco Polo are of the first 
importance. 

Of no less interest is the iourney into the Hadramaut Valley accom- 
plished by Mr. and Mrs. Bent, an account of which was presented to us 
a week ago. They were accompanied by an excellent surveyor, deputed 
by the government of India, and by a botanist from Kew, while their 
own arclneological notes, i)hotographs, and sketches are of exceptional 
value. These experienced travelers were so interested in the strange 
and almost unknown country of Hadramaut that they hope to return 
to continue their explorations in Arabia. 

In Africa there has been, and continues to be, abundant activity, as 
the monthly pages of our journal have shown. We have already heard 
a very full account of Dr. Gregory's expedition to Mount" Kenia, and 
we hope shortly to have full details of the expedition into new country 
north of the Tana River, led by Mr. Astor Chanler, accompanied by 
Lieutenant von Hohmel. Mr. Scott Elliot is actually exploring the 
Ruwenzori region, and we have helped to equii) other young African 



PROMOTION OF ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC DISCOVERY. 339 

travelers who hope to open up new ground. Mr. Coryndou, a friend of 
Mr, Selous, has ah-eady started for the country lying between the west 
shore of Lake Tanganyika and the Kongo, where he will remain for at 
least a year. Dr. Donaldson Smitli, a young American gentleman, 
leaves in a few days for Somali Laud, whence he will push southward 
to Lake Eudolf, thus connecting the discoveries of Count Teleki with 
those that have been made farther north. 

How valuable a service is being i)erforraed by our indefatigable mai) 
curator, Mr. Coles, in giving instruction to intending explorers, is 
shown by the work that has been done by his pupils within the last 
two years. In Africa IMajor Leverson and Mr. F. A. Lamb have done 
surveying work on the Anglo-German boundary commission. Dr. J. W. 
Gregory has surveyed and mapijed the Mount Kenia region, Mr. Teed 
IS now surveying in the territory of the Royal Niger Company, Captain 
Gallwey has been at work in the Oil Rivers Protectorate. Lieut. S. 
Vandeleur, of the Scots Guards, has made an exceedingly well-executed 
route survey in Somali Land, checked by observations for latitude. Mr. 
G. F. Scott Elliot is at work in the Ruwenzori region. In Asia Mr. 
Conway has made surveys and a map of the Karakoram glaciers, and 
Mr. Littledale has done valuable work in central Asia and on the Hoang- 
Ho. In America Mr. C, W. Anderson has been working in British 
Guiana, and our traveling students, Mr. G. B. Grundy and Mr. Cozens 
Hardy, have surveyed, one the battlefield of Plataja, the other a part 
of Montenegro. 

I must not omit to refer to the admirable work accomplished by our 
librarian. Dr. Mill, in the survey of the English lakes, in which he has 
opened up a hitherto unknown jiart of our country, although a part 
which is under water. At one of our meetings in June Dr. Mill will 
explain to us some of the more interesting results of his limnological 
investigations. 

On several occasions during the session I have regretted the absence 
of my illustrious predecessor, Sir Henry Rawlinson, on whom the man- 
tle of Sir Roderick fell in 1871. I especially missed him on the occa- 
sion of Colonel Sawyer's paper on the "Bakhtiari country being read; 
and, indeed, I had a faint lioi)e that he might once more appear 
among us on that occasion, to brighten the discussion by his profound 
knowledge and unrivaled powers of exposition. Sir Henry was one of 
the best of our presidents from every point of view, and I do not know 
his equal in giving life to an apparently dull subject, and in awakening 
an interest in geographical details by enriching them from the abun- 
dant stores of his historical memory. I shall never forget the rapt 
attention with which the audience listened to his account of the route 
taken by the gypsies on their way toward Europe from the valley of 
the Indus. He is unrivaled in showing the dependence of history on a 
knowledge of geography, and though he is often missed by those who

remember tlie time wheu he presided here, he can never be replaced. 
I still indulge the hope of seeing him among us before the session is over. 
In conclusion, it is my duty to announce the retirement of Mr. Doug- 
las Freshfleld from the post of secretary, and that he has declined to 
allow himself to be put in nomination as a member of the new council. 
Mr. Freshfteld was my colleague from 1881 to 1888, and for the last six 
years he has been senior secretary of the society. A renowned climber 
and Alpine explorer, he now holds the honorable post of president of 
the Alpine Club. But he is not a mere climber. He is well versed in 
the historical literature of the Alps, as is shown by his papers on the 
Alpine notes of Leonardo da Vinci in 1881, and on the pass of Hanni- 
bal in 1880. He was also the author of sketches in tbe mountains of 
Ticino. Having exhausted the Alps, Mr. Freshfleld turned to the Cau- 
casus, and our Proceedings have been enriched by four of his papers 
describing with a master hand the physical aspects of that little-known 
range, and his own well-planned and successful ascents. He also pub- 
lished a work on Central Caucasus and Bashan. Mr. Freshfleld gave up 
much of his time to the society, and was indefatigable in his supervision 
of the work of the departments, and initiated our large and valuable col- 
lection of photographs. He introduced the use of photographic slides 
at our evening meetings. He took a special interest in educational 
questions, and the society's arrangements with the universities of 
Oxford and Cambridge owed much to his active and zealous aid. He 
read a paper of great importance at the British Association meeting 
of 1806, on '• The place of geography in education." In that paper lie 
truly remarked that much of the literature of physical science was ren- 
dered unreadable by the absence of the art of letters in its producers. 
The classics, he added, are the authors and models of the art of clear 
and <'ondensed expression for European literature. And this reminds 
me that one of Mr. Freshfleld's highest (pialitications for the post of 
our secretary was that he was a classical scholar. How often have I 
deplored the loss of this qualification through having gone to sea so 
young! Mr. Freshfleld conducted a good deal of correspondence, both 
private and oflScial, the results of which were very conducive to the 
best interests of the society. As an example, I may mention his letters 
to the India office, to which were due the establishment of an excellent 
understanding with the departments in India, and to our behig regu- 
larly supplied with geographical information which was previously 
withheld. He was joint editor of the three latest editions of Hints to 
Travellers, taking the subject of outflt as his own part of the work. 
For these varied and important services the warm thanks of our coun- 
cil and of the society are justly due to Mr. Freshfleld. Although he 
retires, by his own desire, from any further official connection with the 
society, he will, I am sure, continue to take a warm interest in our pro- 
ceedings, and to be an active and zealous, though independent, member 
of our body.

We have liacl heavy losses this year from the deaths of distinguished 
fellows, whose obituaries have appeared in the numbers of our Journal. 
Among them were several dear friends of my own, and I can not help 
mentioning how deeply we have all felt the loss of our late foreign 
secretary, Gen. Sir Beauchamp Walker. 

I have to thank Captain Wharton, the hydrographer, for the account 
which follows of the work that has been done during the year by our 
naval marine surveyor, to whose hard work navigation and geography 
owe so much; and Mr. C. E. D. Black for his abstract of the work of 
the Indian surveys during the past year. 

The magnificent work prepared by a commission, under the auspices 
of the Italian Government, as Italy's contribution toward the celebra- 
tion of the fourth centenary of Golumbus, has just reached me. In the 
name of the fellows of this society, I have warmly congratulated our 
brother geographers in Italy on its appearance. A review of the great 
Colombian work follows this address. 



THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN.i 



By Capt. W. J. L. Wharton, R. N., F. R. S. 



You will not be surprised if, having called upon an liydrograpber to 
preside over this section, he takes for the subject of his review the sea. 
Less apparently interesting, by reason of the uniformity of its surface, 
than the land which raises itself above the level of the waters, and 
with which the term geography is more generally associated, the ocean 
has, nevertheless, received much attention of later years. In Great 
Britain, especially, which has so long rested its i)Osition among the 
nations upon the wealth which our merchant tieets bring to its shores, 
and upon the facilities which the sea affords for communication with 
our numerous possessions all over the globe, investigation into the 
mysteries, whether of its ever-moving surface or of its more hidden 
depths, has been particularly fascinating. I purpose, therefore, to 
attempt a brief survey of our present knowledge of its physical 
condition. 

The very bulk of the ocean, as compared with that of the visible laud, 
gives it an importance which is possessed by no other feature on the 
surface of our planet. Mr. John Murray, after a laborious computation, 
has shown that its cubical extent is probably about fourteen times that 
of the dry land. This statement appeals strongly to the imagination, 
and forms, perhaps, the most powerful argument in favor of the view, 
steadily gaining ground, that the great oceans have in the main existed 
in the form in which we now see them since the constituents of the 
earth settled down into their present condition. 

When it is considered that the whole of the dry land would only fill 
i\]) one third of the Atlantic Ocean, the enormous disproportion of the 
two great divisions of land and sea becomes very apparent. 

The most obvious phenomenon of the ocean is the constant horizontal 
movement of its surface waters, which in many i)arts take well-defined 
directions. These great ocean currents have now been studied for

344 THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN. 

many years, and our knowledge of tliem is approacliing a point beyond 
wliicli it is doubtful whether we shall ever much advance, except in 
small details. For though, while iudisi)utably the waters continually 
move in each great area in generally the same direction, the velocities 
vary, the limits of the different streams and drifts vary, mainly from 
the ever-varying force and direction of the winds. 

After long hesitation and much argument, I think it may be now 
safely held that the iirime motor of the surface currents is the wind. 
Not, by any means, the wind that may blow, and even persistently blow, 
over the portion of water that is moving, more or less rapidly, in any 
direction, but the great winds which blow generally from the same 
general quarter over vast areas. These, combined Avith deflection from 
the land, settle the main surfiice circulation. 

I do not know if any of my hearers may have seen a very remark- 
able model, devised by Mr. Clayden, in Avhich water disi)osed over an 
area shaped like the Atlantic, and sprinkled over with lycopodium dust 
to make movement apparent, was subjected to air impelled from various 
nozzels, representing the mean directions of the permanent winds. It 
dispelled the last doubt I held on the subject, as not only were the 
main currents reproduced, but the smaller effects and peculiarities of 
the Atlantic drifts were produced with surprising accuracy. 

There is a small current, long shown on our charts, but which I had 
always regarded with suspicion. I refer to the stream which, after 
traveling from the Arctic Ocean southward along the east coast of 
Greenland, turns sharply round Cape Farewell to the northward into 
Davis Straits, where it again doubles sharply on itself to the south- 
ward. This is exhibited in the model in all its details, and is evidently 
caused by the i^ressure of the water forced by the mimic Gulf Stream 
into the Arctic region, where it has no escape except by this route, and 
is pressed against the land, round which it turns as soon as it can. 
This is, no doubt, the explanation of the real current. The very 
remarkable winter e(i[uatorial current, which runs in a narrow belt east- 
ward, just north of the main stream traveling Avest, was also reproduced 
with extraordinary tidelity. The winds, however, that are ordinarily 
considered permanent vary greatly, while in the monsoon areas the 
reversal of the currents caused by the opposite winds exercise a great 
influence on the movements of the water far beyond their own limits, 
and anything like a prediction of the i^recise direction and rate of an 
oceanic stream can never be expected. The main facts, however, of 
the great currents can be most certainly and simply explained in this 
manner. The trade winds are the prime motors. They cause a surface 
drift of no great velocity over large areas in the same general direction 
as that in which they blow. These drifts after meeting and combining 
their forces eventually impinge on the land. They are diverted and 
concentrated and increase in speed. They either pour through pas- 
sages between islands, as into the Caribbean Sea, are pressed up by 



THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN. 345 

the land, ami escape by the only outlets i^ossible — as, for example, the 
Strait of Florida, and form a great ocean current like the Gulf Steam — 
or, as in the case of the Agulhas current and the powerful stream which 
runs north along the Zanzibar coast, they are simi)ly pressed up against 
and diverted by the land, and run along it with increased rapidity. 
These rapid currents are eventually apparently lost in the oceans, but 
they in their turn originate movements of a slower character, which on 
again passing over shallow water or on meeting land develop once more 
into well-defined currents. 

We find an analogous state of things on the western side of the Pa- 
cific, where the Japau current is produced in a similar manner. The fact 
that on all western shores of the great oceans toward which the trade 
winds blow we find tbe strongest currents running along the coast, is 
almost enough of itself to prove the connection between them. 

The westerly winds that prevail in higher northern and southern lati- 
tudes are next in order in producing great currents. From the shape 
of the land they in some cases take up and continue the circulation 
commenced by the trade whids; in others they themselves originate 
great movements of the water. Compared to the great circulation from 
this source the effect of differences of temperature or of specific grav- 
ity is insignificant, though no doubt they play their part, especially in 
causing slow under circulation, and in a great degree the vertical mix- 
ing of the lower waters. No drop of the ocean, even at its greatest 
depth, is ever for one moment at rest. 

Dealing with minor iwints, the American officers of the Coast and 
Geodetic Survey have found after long and i)atient investigation that 
the velocity of the Gulf Stream in its initial aiul most marked part, the 
Strait of Florida, is greatly affected by the tide, varying as much as 
one-half its maximum rate during the twenty-four hours. These Amer- 
ican investigations are of greatest interest. They have extended over 
the whole area of the Caribbean Sea and its approaches, the Gulf of 
Mexico, and the Gulf Stream proper and its vicinity. In no other part 
of the ocean has observation of this detailed character been carried 
out, and they throw a great light on oceanic circulation. The BlaJce, 
the vessel specially fitted for the purpose, has during the several years 
in which she was employed on this work anchored in over 2,000 fathoms 
water, or a depth of considerably more than 2 miles, a feat which would 
a short time ago have been deemed impossible. One great point that 
has come out very strongly is the continual variation in the strength 
and direction of the currents and the varying depths to w^hich the sur- 
face current extends. 

Eastward of the chain of the Windward Islands the general depth 
of the surfiice movement may be said to be about 100 fathoms, below 
which tidal influence is very distinct. There is also a very plain back- 
ward flow of water, at depths which vary, caused by the snbmarine 
ridge which connects the Windward chain of the West Indian Islands. 



340 THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN. 

These observ;ition.s also generally support what I have already men- 
tioned: that the velocity of a current depends on the strength of winds, 
possibly thousands of miles distant, which have given the original 
impetus to the water, and this, combined with tidal action when the 
current approaches or runs along a coast, will always cause uncertainty 
on the resultant velocity. 

Dealing for yet another moment with the Gulf Stream, there are two 
points which have not beeu much dwelt upon, but which have a great 
effect on its power of bringing the modifying influence of its warm 
water as far as our shores. The first is the iireventiou of its spread- 
ing, as it leaves the Strait of Florida, by the i^ressure of the x^ortion of 
the equatorial current which, unable to get through the passages 
between the Windward Islands, is diverted to the north of the Baha- 
mas and bears down on the eastward side of the Gulf Stream proper, 
compressing it between itself and the cold water flowing south- 
ward along the American coast, and at the same time adding to its 
forces and maintaining its high temperature. The second is that by 
the time the Gulf Stream has lost its velocity as a current, in about 
the vicinity of the Bank of Newfoundland, it has arrived in the region 
of the westerly winds, that is, of winds whose average direction is from 
west, whose influence, causing a surface drift somewhat comparable 
to that of the trade winds, bears the water onward to the British 
islands and Norway. Without these prevailing westerly winds the 
warm water of the Gulf Stream would never reach these shores. 

The depth to which the surface currents extend in other parts is lit- 
tle known. Direct observations on undercurrents have been rare. In 
the first x)lace, it is not an easy observation to make. Apparatus has 
generally to be im^jrovised. This has usually consisted of some form 
of flat surface lowered to the required depth and suspended in the 
water by a buoy, which presents to the resistance of the ui)per stratum 
a very much smaller area tlian that of the surface beloAv. ]\Iore perfect 
machines have been devised, notably that used by the Americans in 
their West Indian experiments. These, however, are delicate and 
require so much care and experience in working, and so much time is 
wanted for such observations, tbat under the pressure of the more 
urgent requirements on surface movements in the interests of naviga- 
tion very little has been done. The Challenger made some observations 
on the depth of the equatorial current in mid- Atlantic, but they were 
not very conclusive for lack of suitable appliances. Tliej", however, 
tended to show that below 100 fathoms there Avas but little current. 

It has been calculated theoretically that winds blowing steadily in 
one direction with the ordinary force of the trade winds would in 
100,000 years by friction between the particles put the whole of a mass 
of water 2,000 fathoms deej), not otherwise influenced, into motion in 
that direction; but the direction and force of the trade winds are ever 
changing, and the actual strong currents of the ocean are not in the 



THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN. 347 

trade-wind areas, but are the result of these drifts meeting one another 
and being compressed by the conformation of the land. We can not 
therefore expect this theoretical effect to be realized. 

One iuvstance of the nnderrunning of one current by another is 
brought very plainly to our notice in the North Atlantic to the east of 
the Great Banks of ^STewfoundland, where the icebergs borne by the 
Arctic current from Baffin Bay pursue their course to the southward 
across the Gulf Stream running eastward. These great masses of ice, 
floating with seven-eighths of their volume under the surface, draw so 
much water that they are all but wliolly influenced by the undercur- 
rent. A large berg will have its bottom as much as 600 or 700 feet 
below the surface. The only reason that these bergs continue their 
journey southward is the action of the cold undercurrent. 

It was my good fortune to be ordered in 1872 to undertake a series 
of experiments of the currents and undercurrents of the Dardanelles 
and Bosporus. They proved most interesting. It was well known 
that a surface stream is almost continuously passing out of the Black 
Sea through the Bosporus into the Sea of Marmara, and again through 
the Dardanelles into the Mediterranean. Certain physicists, of whom 
Dr. W. Carpenter was one, were, however, of opinion that a return 
current would be found under the surface running in the opposite 
direction, and this I was enabled to demonstrate. Though from the 
imperfection of our apparatus, which w^e had to devise on the spot, we 
were unable to exactly proj)ortionate the quantities of water moving 
in the two directions, we found, whenever the surface current was 
rushing southwestward through these straits, that for a certain dis- 
tance, from the bottom upward, the water was in rapid motion in the 
opposite direction. It was an astonishing sight to behold the buoys 
which supported a wooden framework of 30 square feet area, lowered 
to depths from 100 to 210 feet, tearing up the straits against a stroug 
surface curient of as much as 3 and 1 miles an hour. It was as per- 
fect an ocular denu)nstratiou of a counter undercurrent as could be 
wished, and the Turks, who watched our j)roceedings with much sus- 
picion, were strongly of opinion that the devil had a hand in it, and 
only the exhibition of the Sultan's flrman saved us from interruption. 
In the investigation of these currents we found, as usual, that the wind 
was the most potent agent. Though the surface water from the Black 
Sea is almost fresh, and the bottom water of the heavy Mediterranean 
density of 1.027, it was found that wheu calm had prevailed the surface 
current slackened, and at times became nil, w^hile the undercurrent 
responded by a similar slackening. 

The ordinary condition of wind in the regions of the Black Sea and 
Sea of Marmara is that of a prevalent northeast wind. '1 his causes a 
heaping up of the water on the southwest shores of those seas, pre- 
cisely where the straits open, and the surface water therefore rapidly 
escapes. These straits no doubt present abnormal characters, but, so 



348 THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN. 

far as surface currents are concerned, the long series of observations 
then made convinced me of tlie inadequacy of difterences of si^ecilic 
gravity, which were here at a maximum, to cause any perceptible hori- 
zontal flow of water. I have said that we were unable to define by 
direct observation the exact position of the dividing line between the 
opposing currents, but tbe rapid change in the specific gravity at a cer- 
tain deptb, which varied on different days, gave a strong indication 
that the currents changed at this point. 

A Russian officer, Ca]itain Maknroflf, afterwards made similar experi- 
ments in the Bosporus, but with more perfect ap])linnces, and he found 
that at the point where the specific gravity changed the currents also 
changed. 

I have been anxious to obtain similar observations at the Straits of 
Babel Mandeb, the southern outlet of the Red Sea, where somewhat 
similar conditions prevail. Ilere the winds are governed by the mon- 
soons. For half the year the wind blows from the north down the 
whole length of the sea, causing a surface flow outward into the Gulf 
of Aden and a general lowering of the whole level of the sea of about 
2 feet. For the other half of the year the wind at the southern end of 
the sea is strong from the southeast, causing a surface set into the Red 
Sea, over which the general level of the water rises, while the northerly 
wind continues to blow throughout the northern half. At either of 
these times I think it is highly probable that there is an undercurrent in 
the opi)osite direction to that at the surface, but unfortunately the sea 
disturbance is great and observations are very difficult. Observations 
were, however, made by Capt. W. U. Moore in H. M. S. Pou/uin in 
1890, but at a time when the change of monsoon was taking place. 
The result was peculiar, for it appeared that at a depth of about 360 
feet the movement of the water was tidal, while the surface water was 
moving slowly in one direction — a result generally similar to that 
obtained by the Americans in the West Indies — but the direction of 
the tidal flow was directly opposite to Avhat might have been expected, 
viz, the water ran in while the tide fell, and vice versa. More obser- 
vations are, however, needed here before any certain conclusions can 
be formed. 

The depth of tlie ocean is the next great feature which demands 
attention. On this our knowledge is steadily, though slowly, increas- 
ing. The whole of it has been gained during the last fifty years. Com- 
menced by Sir James Ross, whose means were very small, but who 
nevertheless demonstrated that the so-called unfathomable ocean was 
certainly fathomable everywhere, the sounding of the ocean has con- 
tinuously proceeded. The needs of submarine cables have constantly 
demanded knowledge in this i)articular, and the different cable compa- 
nies have had a large share in ascertaining the fixcts. Expeditions 
whose main object has been to obtain soundings have been sent out. 
Great Britain and the United States taking the first place; but most

maritime nations have aided. In the immediate past the additions have 
mainly been from the soundings which Her Majesty's surveying ships 
continually take whenever on passage from one place to another, from 
the work of our cable companies, and from United States vessels. We 
have as a result a very fjiir general knowledge of the prevailing depths 
in the Atlantic, but of the Indian and Pacific oceans it is very fragmen- 
tary. We have enough to give us a general idea, but our requirements 
increase as years roll on. It is a vast task, and it may be safely said 
will never be completed, for we shall never be satislied until we know 
the variations of level under the water as well as we know those on the 
dry land. 

It is hopeless to do more than to briefly sketch the amount of our 
knowledge. First, as to the greatest depths known. It is very remark- 
able, and from a geological point of view significant, that the very deep- 
est parts of the ocean are not in or near their centers, but in all cases are 
very near land. One hundred and ten miles outside the Kurile Islands, 
which stretch from the northern point of Japan to the northeast, the 
deepest sounding has been obtained of 4,655 fathoms, or 27,930 feet. 
This appears to be in a deep depression, which runs i)arallel to the Kurile 
Islands and Japan, but its extent is unknown, and may be very large. 
Seventy miles north of Puerto Eico, in the West Indies, is the next deep- 
est cast known, viz, 4,561 fathoms, or 27,366 feet — not far inferior to the 
Pacific depth; but here the deep area must be comparatively small, as 
shallower soundings have been made at distances 60 miles north and 
east of it. A similar depression has been sounded during the last few 
years west of the great range of the Andes at a distance of 50 miles 
from the coast of Peru, where the greatest depth is 4,175 fathoms. 
Other isolated depths of over 4,000 fathoms have been sounded in the 
Pacific — one between the Tonga or Friendly Islands of 4,500 fathoms, 
one of 4,478 fathoms near the Ladrones, and another of 4,428 fathoms 
near Pylstaart Island, all in the Western Pacific. They all require 
further investigation to determine their extent. With these few excep- 
tions the depth of the oceans so far as yet known nowhere comes up to 
4,000 fathoms, or 4 sea miles, but there can be little doubt that other 
similar hollows are yet to be found. 

The sea with the greatest mean depth apjiears to be the vast Pacific, 
which covers 67,000,000 of the 188,000,000 of square miles composing 
the earth's surface. Of these 188,000,000, 137,000,000 are sea, so that 
the Pacific comprises just one-half of the water of the globe and more 
than one-third of its whole area. The Northern Pacific has been esti- 
mated by Mr. John Murray to have a mean depth of over 2,500 fathoms, 
while the Southern Pacific is credited with a little under 2,400 fathoms. 
These figures are based on a number of soundings, which can not be 
designated otherwise than very sparse. 

To give an idea of what remains to be done I will mention that in the 
eastern i)art of the Central Pacific there is an area of 10,500,000 square 



350 THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN. 

miles iu wliicli there are only seven soundings, wliile in a long strip 
crossing the whole North Pacific, which has an area of 1*,800,()00 square 
miles, there is no sounding at all. Nevertheless, while the approximate 
mean depth I am mentioning may be considerably altered as knowledge 
increases, we know enough to say that the Pacific is generally deeper 
than the other oceans. The immensity, both in bulk and area, of this 
great mass of water is difficult to realize, but it may assist us when we 
realize that the whole of the land on the globe above water level, if 
shoveled into the Pacific, would only fill one-seventh of it. The Indian 
Ocean, with an area of 25,000,000 square miles, has a mean depth, ac- 
cording to Mr. Murray, of a little over 2,000 fathoms. Tliis also is esti- 
mated from a very insufficient number of soundings. The Atlantic, by 
far the best-sounded ocean, has an area of 31,000,000 square miles, with 
a mean depth of about 2,200 fathoms. 

The temperature of this huge mass of water is an interesting point. 
The temperature of the surface is most important to us, as it is largely 
on it that the climates of the different parts of the world depend. This 
is comparatively easy to ascertain. We know so much about it that 
we are not likely to improve on it for many years. We are quite able 
to understand wiiy countries iu the same latitude differ so widely in 
their respective mean temperatures, wby fogs prevail iu certain locali- 
ties more than others, and how it comes about that others are subject 
to tempestuous storms. On the latter point nothing has come out 
plainer from recent discussion than the fact that areas where great dif- 
ferences of surface temperature of the sea prevail are those in which 
storms are generated. It is a matter of observation that in the region 
south of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland many of the storms which 
travel over the Atlantic to this country have their rise. An examina- 
tion of surface temperature shows that in this region the variations are 
excessive, not only from the juxtaposition of the warm water of the 
Gulf Stream and the cold water of the Arctic current flowing south- 
ward inside of it, but in the Gulf Stream itself, which is composed of 
streaks of warm and colder water, between which differences of as much 
as 20° F. exist. The same conditions exist south of the Cape of Good 
Hope, another well-known birthplace of storms. Here the Agulhas 
current of about 70° F., diverted by the land, pours into the mass of 
water to the southward colder by some 25°, and the meeting place is 
well known as most tempestuous. Southeast of the Rio de la Plata is 
another stormy area, and here we find the same abnormal variations in 
surface temperature. Yet another is found off the northeast coast of 
Japan with the same conditions. These differences are brought about 
by the mingling of water carried either by the flowing of a powerful cur- 
rent turned by the land into a mass of water of different temi)erature, 
as is the case off the Cape of Good Hope, or by the uprising of lower 
strata of cooler water through a shallow surface stream, as appears to 
be the case in the Gulf Stream. 



THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN. 351 

A remarkable point recently bronglit to light by the researches of 
Mr. John Murray in Scotch lochs is the eifect of wind on the surface 
temperature. It has been observed that wind driving off a shore drifts 
the surface water before it. This water is replaced by the readiest 
means, that is to say, by water from l)elow the surface rising to take 
its place. As the lower strata are in all cases cooler than the surface a 
lowering of the temperature results, and we find in fact that near all sea- 
shores off which a steady wind blows the water is cooler than farther to 
seaward. This has an important bearing on coral growth, and explains 
why on all western coasts of the great continents off" which tlie trade 
winds blow we find an almost absolute dearth of coral, while on the east- 
ern coasts, on which warm currents impinge, reefs abound, the coral 
animal flourishing only in water above a certain temperature. 

Observations of the temperature of the strata of water between the 
surface and bottom have been of late years obtained in many parts. 
Comiiared with the area of the oceans they are but few, but our knowl- 
edge steadily increases every year. The subject of the vertical distri- 
bution of temperature has not yet been thoroughly investigated in the 
light of the whole of the information which we now possess, but Dr. 
Alexander Buchau has been for some time devoting his spare time to the 
task, and it is a heavy labor, for the data obtained here and there over 
the world by different ships of all maritime nations are very difficult to 
collect and to appraise; but I understand that before long we shall have 
the result, which will prove very interesting, in the last volume of the 
Challenger series. It will readily be uiulerstood that observations on tem- 
peratures at great depths require great care. In the first place, the ther- 
mometers must be most carefully manufactured. They must be subjected 
to rigorous tests, and they must be carefully handled during the oper- 
ation. All observations are not of the same value, and the discussion 
therefore presents considerable difficulty and demands much discretion. 
In the meantime we can state certain known tacts. We have learned 
that the depth of the warm surface water is small. In the equatorial 
current between Africa and South America, where the surface is of a 
temperature of 78°, at 100 fathoms it is only 55°, a difference of 23°, and a 
temperature of 40° is reached at 400 fathoms. In this region, so far as 
knowledge goes, the fall in temperature as we descend is most rapid; 
but, generallj^ speaking, the same variations prevail everywhere. In 
the tropical Pacific the temperature falls 32° from the surface, where it 
stands at 82°, to a depth of 200 fathoms, 40° being reached at from 
500 to ()00 fathoms below the surface. Below the general depth of from 
400 to 600 fathoms the temperature decreases very slowly, but there 
is considerable variation in the absolute amount of it when we get to 
great depths in different parts of the ocean. 

One of the most interesting facts that has been recognized is that in 
inclosed hollows of the ocean the bottom temperature is apparently 
much less than that of the stratum of water at a corresponding depth

in the waters outside the submarine rid yje that forms tlie iudosing walls, 
separating them from deejier areas beyond, and is, in all cases that 
have been observed, equal to that on the ridge. From this fact we are 
enabled to sui)plement our imperfect knowledge of depths, because if 
in a certain i^art of an ocean we And that the temperature at great 
depths is higher than we know exists at similar depths in waters api^ar- 
eiitly connected, we can feel certain that there is a submarine ridge 
which cuts off the bottom waters from moving along, and that the 
depth on this ridge is that at which is found the corresponding tem 
perature in the outer waters. As a corollary we also assume that the 
movement of water at great depths is confined to an almost impercep- 
tible movement, for if there was a motion that we could term, in the 
ordinary accej)tation of the word, a current, it would infallibly surmount 
a ridge and pour over the other side, carrying its lower temperature 
with it. A notable instance is the bottom temperature of the North 
Atlantic. This is nowhere below 35° F., althougli the depths are very 
great. But in the South Atlantic at a depth of only 2,800 fathoms the 
bottom temperature is but a little above 32° F., and we are therefore 
convinced that somewhere between Africa and South America, though 
soundings do not yet show it, there must be a ridge at a depth of about 
2,000 fathoms. We also come to the same conclusion with regard to 
the eastern and western portions of the South Atlantic, wliere similar 
differences prevail. Again, the few temperatures that have been 
obtained in the eastern South Pacific show a considerable difference 
from those in the South x\tlantic, and we are compelled to assume a 
ridge from the Falkland Islands to the Antarctic continent. 

It is interesting that the investigation into the translation of the 
great seismic wave caused by the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 led to a 
similar and entirely independent conclusion. The Avave caused by the 
explosion in the Straits of Sunda reached Cape Horn, where by good 
chance a French meteorological expedition liad erected an automatic 
tide gauge, but instead of one series of waves being marked on the 
paper there were two. A little consideration showed that the South 
Pole having directly interposed between Sunda Straits and Cape Horn, 
the waves diverted l)y the land about the pole would arrive from both 
sides. One wave, however, made its appearance seven hours before 
the other. Study showed that the earliest wave coincided in time with 
a wave traveling on the Pacific side of the pole, with a velocity due to 
the known depth, while the later wave must have been retarded in its 
journey via the South Atlantic. The only possible explanation is that 
the wave had been imjieded by comparatively shallow water. The evi- 
dence from bottom temperature was then unknown, and thns does one 
branch of investigation aid another. 

In the Western Pacific the water is colder, a few bottom tempera- 
tures of a little over 33° F. having been found in the deep trongh east 
of the Tonga Islands; but the North Pacific, though the deejier ocean — 



THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN. 353 

of enormous area and volume — is apparently again cut ofltby a subma- 
rine ridge. The nortlr,vestern part of the Indian Ocean is for similar 
reasons assumed to be divided from the main body, the shallower water 
probably running from the Seychelles to the Maldive Islands. 

Mr. Buchan has pointed out why some parts of oceans, deep and vast 
though they be, are, Avhen cut off from communication with others, 
■warmer at the bottom. Water can only sink through lower layers 
when it is the heavier, and though a warmer surface current becomes 
from evaporation denser, its heat makes it specifically lighter than the 
strata below. It is only when such a current parts gradually with its 
heat, as in traveling from tropical to temperate regions, that it sinks 
and slowly but surely carries its temperature with it, modifying the 
extreme natural cold of the bottom layers. In the North Atlantic and 
Pacific we have such a condition. The great currents of the Gulf 
Stream and Japan current as they flow to the north sink, and in the 
course of ages have succeeded in raising the bottom temperatnre 3 or 
I degrees. In the southern seas this influence is not at work, and 
directly connected with the more open water around the South Pole, 
there is nothing to carry to the abysmal depths any heat to raise them 
from their normal low temperatures, due to the absence of any heating- 
influence. The ice masses around the South Pole have probably little 
or no effect on bottom temperature, as the fresher, though colder, water 
will not sink; and, as a matter of fact, warmer water is found at a few 
huiulred fathoms than at the surface. The lowest temperature ever 
obtained was by Sir John Eoss in the Arctic Ocean in Davis Strait at 
a depth of 080 fathoms, when he recorded a reading of 25° F. This 
probably requires confirmation, as thermometers of those days were 
somewhat imperfect. In the great oceans the greatest cold is found on 
the western side of the South Atlantic, where the thermometer stands 
at 32.3° F., but temperatures of 29° F. have been obtained of recent 
years east of the Faroe Islands, north of the ridge which cuts oft" the 
deeper waters of the Arctic from the Atlantic. 

Though scarcely within the limits of my subject, which is the sea 
itself, I must say a few words on the sea floor. The researches carried 
on in the Challenger revealed that, while for a certain distance from the 
continents the bottom is comi)osed of terrestrial detritus, everywhere 
in deep water it is mainly composed of the skeletons or remains of 
skeletons of the minute animals that have lived in the water. In com- 
paratively small depths we find remains of many shells. As the depth 
increases to 500 fathoms or so we get mainly the calcareous shells of 
the globigerina', which may be said to form by far the greater iiart of 
the oceanic floor. In deei)er water still, where pressure, combined with 
the action of the carbonic acid, has dissolved all calcareous matter, we 
find an impalpable mud with skeletons of the siliceous radiolaria of 
countless forms of the greatest beauty and complexity. Deeper still, 
i. e., in water of, speaking generally, over 3,000 fathoms, we find a 
SM 91 23 



354 THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN. 

reddisli-colored clayey mud, in which the only traces uf recognizable 
organic remains are teeth of sliarks and cetacea, many belonging to 
extinct species. What the depths of these deposits may be is a sub- 
ject of speculation. It may be that some day, as mechanical appliances 
are imjuoved, we shall find means of boring, but up to the present no 
such operation has been attempted. 

On the specific gravity of the water of the sea I can say but little 
except that it varies considerably. It is not yet known for certain how 
far the specific gravities observed at various points and depths remain 
api)reciably constant. In localities where evaporation is great and 
other influences do not interfere it is evident that the specific gravity 
of the surface will be high; a consideration which observations contirm, 
but there are many complications whicli require more observation 
before they can be resolved. In some few ])laces repeated observations 
permit deductions, but taking the sea as a whole we are yet very 
ignorant of the facts bearing on this point. 

The waves which forever disturb the surface of the sea demand much 
study. The greatest of these, and the most regular, is the tidal wave. 
On this many powerful intellectts have been brought to bear, but it still 
presents many unsolved anomalies. Lord Kelvin and Professor Darwin 
have demonstrated that the tidal inovement is made up of many waves 
depending upon different functions of the moon and sun, some being 
semidiurnal, some diurnal. The time of transit over the meridian, the 
declination of both bodies, create great variations; the changing dis- 
tance and position of the moon and the position of her node also have 
great effect, while the ever-varying direction and force of the winds and 
the different pressure of the atmosphere play their part, and sometimes 
a very large x)art, on what is somewhat loosely known as the meteorolog- 
ical tide. The amplitude of the oscillation of the water depending upon 
each of the astronomical functions varying for every point on the earth, 
the effect is that, each having a different period, the resulting mean 
movement of water has most astonishing variations. In some places 
there is but one apparent tide in the day; in others this phenomenon 
occurs only at particular periods of each lunation, while in the major- 
ity of cases it is the movements of each alternate tide only that appear 
to have much to do with one another. Though after long observation 
made of the times and ranges of tides at any one spot they can now be 
predicted with great accuracy for that particular i)lace by the method 
of harmonic analysis, perfected by Prof. G. Darwin, the meteorological 
tide excei)te(l, no one can yet say what the tide will be at any spot 
where observations have not beeii made. 

Observations all over the world have now shown that there is no i)art 
where the tidal movement is so regular and simple as around the P>rit- 
ish Islands. This is more remarkable when it is found that the tides 
on the other side of the Atlantic — at Nova Scotia, for instance — are 
very complicated. The minor tides, which in most parts of the world, 



THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN. 355 

when combiued in one direction, anionnt to a very considerable fraction 
of the principal Innar and solar tides, and consequently greatly increase 
or diminish their effects, are in (Jreat ]5ritain so insignificant that their 
influence is trifling; but why this should be I have never yet found any- 
one to explain. ISTevertheless there are many very curious i)oints about 
our tides which are i»]ainly caused by interference, or, in other words, 
by tlie meeting of two tidal waves arriving from opiiosite directions or 
from the rebound of the tidal waves from other coasts. This effect, 
also, it has been so far found impossible to i^redict without observation. 
On our southern coasts, for instance, in the western part the tide rises 
about 15 feet, but as it travels eastward the range becomes less and 
less until, about Poole, it reaches a minimum of G feet. Farther east 
again it increases to Hastings, where the range is 24 feet. Yet farther 
east it again gradually diminishes. This is due to the reflection from the 
French coast, which brings another wave which either superposes itself 
upon or reduces tlie effect of the main tide advancing up the English 
Channel; but the details of such retlection are so complex that no one 
could forecast them without more knowledge than we i)ossass. There 
can be little doubt tliat to this cause — reflection — is mainly due the vari- 
ations in the amount of mean range of tide which are found on many 
coasts at different parts; and as these reflected waves may arrive from 
great distances and be many in number, we may cease to wonder at the 
extraordinary differences in range of tide which prevail, though it will 
be understood that this is wholly separate from the varying heights 
of each successive tide or of the tide at different parts of each lunation, 
or at different times of the year, Avhich depend upon the astronomical 
influences. 

The actual height of the tide in deep water is small, but on passing 
into shallow water when approaching a shore, and especially when roll- 
ing up a gulf of more or less funnel shape, it becomes increased by the 
retardation caused by friction and by compression laterally, and hence 
the height of the tide on a coast affected by other causes is greater than 
in the open sea. The oceanic tide wave is supi)osed to be from 2 to 3 
feet in heiglit, but as this has been assumed from observations made 
at small oceanic islands where, although the magnifying influences 
mentioned are at a miiiimnni, they still exist, we wait for precise infor- 
mation until some means of actually measuring the tide iu deep 
water is devised. 

The waves due to wind, though not so far-reaching in their effects as 
the majestic march of the tide wave, are j)henomena which are more 
apparent to the traveler on the ocean. The deep sea in a heavy gale 
presents, perhaps, the most impressive manifestation of the powers of 
nature which man can behold, and doubtless many of us have expe- 
rienced feelings that may vary from awe and wonder to sheer delight, 
according to the temperament of each individual, at for the first time 
finding himself face to face with this magnificent sight, though I rather 



356 THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE OCEAN. 

fear that discomfort is the prevailing feeling that many carry away. 
The height to which storm waves may arise has never been very satis- 
factorily determined. Apart from the difficulty of the task and the 
small number of people who will address themselves to it when they 
have the chance, it isbutrarely that any individual sees really abnormal 
waves, even though he may be at sea all his life. Different heights 
for what are called maximum waves have been recorded, and they vary 
from 40 to 00 feet from crest to hollow. All we can say is that the 
most probable ligure is about 50 or GO feet. These great storm waves 
travel very far. In some cases they convey a warning, as their velocity 
always far exceeds that at which the storm is traveling. In others 
they intimate that a gale of which no more is seen has occurred some- 
where — it may be many miles distant. When they have traveled 
bej^ond the limits of the wind which raised them they lose the steep- 
ness of slope which characterizes them when under its influence and 
become an undulation which is scarcely noticed when in deep water. 
On approaching shallow water, however, they are again apparent, and 
the "rollers" that occur unperiodically at various jilaces in latitudes 
where gales never occur would seem to be caused by such waves, origi- 
nating in areas many thousands of miles distant. Such appears to be 
the origin of the well-known rollers at Ascension and St. Helena, where 
the rocky and ex])osed nature of the landing has caused this phenom- 
enon to be especially noticed. 

Other rollers are, however, undoubtedly due to earthquakes or vol- 
canic eruptions occurring in the bed of the sea. INIany of the great 
and sudden waves which have caused devastation and great loss of life 
on the shores of western South America are referable to this cause. 
Observations to enable the focus of such a disturbance to be traced 
have generally been lacking, but it is probable that where the wave has 
been large the point of origin has not been far distant. • In one nota- 
ble instance the conditions were reversed. The point of origin was 
known, and the distance to which the resulting wave traveled could be 
fairly satisfactorily traced. This was the great eruption in the Straits 
of Sunda, in August, 1883, which locally resulted in the disappearance 
of the major part of the island of Krakatoa, and the loss of nearly 
40,000 lives on the neigboring shores of Java and Sumatra by the huge 
wave which devastated them. The records of automatic tide gauges 
and the observations of individuals enabled the waves emanating from 
this disturbance to be followed to great distances. These waves were 
of great length, the crests, arriving at intervals of about an hour, and 
moving with a velocity of about 350 miles an hour, were about that dis- 
tance apart. The waves recorded at Cape Horn were apparently 
undoubtedly due to the erui)tion and traveled distances of 7,500 miles 
and 7,800 miles in their course on either side of the south polar land. 
They were only 5 inches in height above mean level of the sea, while 
the waves recorded at places on the southern part of Africa, at a dis- 
tance of about 5,000 miles from the sceue of the erui)tion, were from

1 to 2 feet high, the original long waves being of an unknown height, 
but probably did not exceed 10 or 15 feet, l^o other such opportunity 
of testing the distances to which great waves may travel lias ever 
occurred, and as such a catastrophe as gave rise to them could scarcely 
be repeated without similar loss of life, it may be hoped we shall not 
live to see another, interesting though the discussion of the numerous 
phenomena were. 

The movement of the particles of water due to the tide wave extends 
to the bottom of the deepest water, and doubtless plays an important 
part in keeping up a constant motion in the abysses, but the depth to 
which the action of the surface waves originating in wind reach is still 
but little known by observation. If, however, Ave study the contour of 
the bottom oft' the shores of land exposed to the full influence of the 
great oceans, we are struck by the very general rapid increase of slope 
after a depth of about 80 to 100 fathoms (500 to GOO feet) has been 
reached. It appears probable that this is connected with the depth to 
which wave action may extend, the line particles brought down by 
rivers or washed from the land by the attrition of the breakers being 
distributed and gradually moved down the slope. When we examine 
banks in the open sea, we find, however, that there are a great many 
with a general depth of from 30 to 40 fathoms, and tlie question arises 
whether this may not be the general limit of the power of oceanic waves 
to cut down the mass acted upon when it is fairly friable. 

The question has an interesting bearing on the subject of the ever- 
debated origin of coral atolls, for this is the general depth of many 
large lagoons; and granted that the sea can cut down land to this 
depth, we have at once an approach to the solution of the problem of 
the formation of bases of a suitable depth and material upon which the 
coral animal can commence operations. This question also awaits more 
light, audi merely offer this remark as a suggestion. It is, however, 
somewhat remarkable that in recent cases of volcanic islands piled up 
by submarine eruptions, they have all been more or less rapidly washed 
away, and are in process of further diminution under the surface. 

Observations on the mean level of the sea show that it constantly 
varies, in some places more than others. This subject has not yet been 
worked out. In some localities it is plainly due to wind, as in the Ked 
Sea, where the summer level is some 2 feet below that of winter, owing 
to the fact that in summer the wind blows down the whole length of the 
sea, and drives the water out. In many places, as in the great estuary 
of the E.io de la Plata, the level is constantly varying with the direction 
of the winds, and the fluctuation due to this cause is greatly in excess 
of the tidal action. In others the cause is not so clear. At Sydney, 
New South Wales, Mr. Kussell found tbat during eleven years the level 
was constantly falling at about an inch a year, but by the last accounts 
received it was again stationary. 

The variations in the pressure of the atmosphere play an important 
part in changes of sea level. A difference of 1 inch in the barometer

lias been shown to be lollowed by a dift'erence of a foot in the mean 
level of the se;i, and in ])arts of the world wlicie the mean height of the 
barometer varies mncli with t?lie seasons and the tidal range is small, 
this effect is very marked. 

Of any seenlar changti in the level of tlie sea little is known. This 
can oidy be measnred by com[)arison with the land, and it is a qnestion 
■which is the more unstable, the land or the water — i)robably the land, 
as it has been shown that the mass of the Uxnd is so trilling, compared 
with that of the ocean, thjit it wonld take a great deal to alter tlie gen- 
eral mean level of tlie latter. 

All the points connected with the sea that I have had the honor of 
bringing before you form part of the daily observation of the marine 
surveyor when he has the chance, but I can not refrain from also men- 
tioning other duties, which are indeed in the present state of our knowl- 
edge and of the practical requirements of navigation, the principal 
points to which he has to pay attention, as it may explain why our 
knowledge on so many interesting details still remains very imperfect. 

Working as we do in the interests of the vast marine of (h-eat 
Britain, the paramount necessity of good navigational charts requires 
that the production of such charts should be our })rincipal aim. It is 
difticult for a landsman and difficult even for a sailor who has never 
done such work to realize the time that is necessary to make a really 
complete marine survey. The most important part, the ascertainment 
of the depth, is done, so to speak, in the dark — that is to say, it is by 
touch and not by sight that we have to find the different elevations 
and depressions of the bottom of the sea. In making a map of the 
land an isolated rock or hill stands up like a beacon above the surround- 
ing laud, and is at once localized and marked, but a similar object under 
the sea can only be found by patient and long-continued sounding, and 
may very easily be missed. 

When it is considered that marine surveying has only been seriously 
undertaken for about one hundred years, with a very limited number of 
vessels, we shall, T think, understand how in the vast area of the waters, 
taking only those bordering the shores, many unsuspected dangers 
are yearly discovered. Very, very few coasts have been minutely sur- 
veyed, and, setting aside for a moment the great changes that take 
place off shores where sandbanks prevail, I should be sorry to say 
that even on our own coasts charts are perfect. Yearly around Great 
Britain previously unknown rocks come to light, and if this is the case 
at home, what are we to think of the condition of charts of less-known 
localities ! Our main efforts therefore are directed to the improvement of 
charts for safe navigation, and the time that can be spared to the eluci- 
dation of purely scientific i)roblems is limited. jSTeverthcless, the daily 
work of the surveyor is so intimately connected with these scientific 
problems that year by year, slowly but surely, we add to the accumula- 
tiou of our knowledge of the sea. 



THE OlIIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS AKD THE DISCOV- 
ERY OF THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN.i 



By W. K. Brooks, 

I'rofessor of Zoolot/i) in ihe Johns Hopkins University. 



In the Origin of Species Darwin says that the sudden appearance of 
si)ecies belonging to several of the main divisions of the animal king- 
dom in the lowest known fossiliferous rocks is at present inexplicable 
and may be truly iirged as a valid objection to his views. 

It his theory be true, he says that "it is indisputable that before the 
lowest Cambrian stratum was deposited long periods elapsed, as long 
as, or probably far longer than, the whole interval from the Cambrian 
age to the present day, and that during these vast periods the world 
swarmed with living creatures. Here," he says, "we encounter a for- 
midable objection ; for it seems doubtful whether the earth, in a tit state 
for the habitation of living creatures, has lasted long enough. To the 
question why we do not iind such Ibssiliferous deposits belonging to 
these assumed earliest periods i)rior to the Cambrian system I can give 
no satistiictory answer." 

On its geological side this dihiculty is even greater than it was in 
Darwin's day, for we now know that the fauna of the Lower Cambrian 
was rich and varied; that most of the modern types of animal life were 
represented in the oldest fauna which has been discovered, and that all 
its tyi)es have modern representatives. The ])aleontological side of 
the subject has been ably summed up by Walcott in an interesting 
memoir on the oldest fauna which is known to us from fossils, and his 
collection of one hundred and forty-one American species from the 
Lower Cambrian is distributed over most of the marine groups of the 
animal kingdom, and except for tlu; absence of the remains of verte- 
brated animals, the whole ])rovince of animal life is almost as com- 
pletely covered by these one hundred and forty-one species as it could 
be by a collection from the bottom of the modern ocean. Four of the 
American species are sponges, two are hydrozoa, nine are actinozoa, 
twenty-nine are brachiopods, three are lamellibranchs, thirteen are gas-

teropods, fifteen are pteropods, eight are Crustacea, fifty-one are trilo- 
bites, and trails and burrows show the existence of at least six species 
of bottom forms, probably worms or Crustacea. The most notable char- 
acteristic of this fauna is the completeness with which these few sj^ecies 
outline the whole fauna, of the modern sea floor. Far from showing us 
the simi)le unspecialized ancestors of modern animals, they are most 
intensely modern themselves in the zoological sense, and they belong- 
to the same order of nature as that which prevails at the present day. 

The fossiliferous beds of the Lower Cambrian rest upon beds Avhich 
are miles in vertical thickness, and are identical in all their physical 
features with those which contain this fauna. They prove beyond 
question that the waters in which they were laid down were as fit for 
supporting life at the beginning as at the end of the enormous lapse of 
time which they represent, and that all the conditions have since been 
equally favorable for the preservation and the discovery of ibssils. 
Modern discovery has brouglit the difiiculty Avhich Darwin points out 
into clearer view, but geologists are no more prepared than he was to 
give a satisfactory solution, although I shall now try to show that the 
study of living animals in their relations to the world around them 
does help us, and that comparative anatomy aud conq)arative embry- 
ology and the study of the habits aud affinities of organisms tell ns of 
times more ancient than the oldest fossils and give a more jierfect 
record of the early history of life than paleontology. 

While the history of life as told by fossils has been slow and 
gradual, it has not been uniform, for we have evidence of the occur- 
rence of several periods when modification was comparatively rapid. 

We are living in a period of iutellectual progress, and among terres- 
trial animals cunning now counts for more than size or strength, and 
fossils show that, while the average size of mammals has diminished 
since the Middle Tertiary, the size of their brains has increased more 
than 100 per cent; that the brain of a modern mammal is more than 
twice as large, compared with its body, as the brain of its ancestors in 
the Middle Tertiary. Measured in years the Middle Tertiary is very 
remote, but it is very modern compared with the whole history of the 
fossilifenms rocks, although more of brain development has been 
effected in this short time than in all preceding time from the beginning. 

The later paleozoic and early secondary fossils mark another i)eriod 
of rapid change, when the fitness of the land for animal life, and the 
presence of land plants, brought about the evolution of terrestrial 
animals. 

I shall give reasons for seeing, in the Lower Cambrian, another period 
of rapid change, when a new factor — the discovery of the bottom of the 
ocean — began to act in the modification of species, and I shall try to 
show that, while animal life was abundant long before, the evolution of 
animals likely to be preserved as fossils took place with comparative 
rapidity, and that the zoological features of the Lower Cambrian are of 



THE ORICxIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 3G1 

sncli a character as to indicate that it is a decided and unmistakabh' 
approximation to the primitive fauna of the bottom, bej^ond whicli life 
was represented only by minute and simple surface animals not likely 
to be preserved as fossils. 

liJ'othing brings home more vividly to the zoologist a picture of the 
diversity of the Lower Cambrian fauna and of its intimate relation to 
the fauna on the bottom of the modern ocean than the thought that 
he would have found on the old Cambrian shore the same opportunity 
to study the embryology and anatomy of pteropods and gasteropods 
and lamellibranchs, of Crustacea and medusre, echinoderms aud bra- 
chiopods, that he now has at a marine laboratory; that his studies 
would have followed the same lines then that they do now, and that 
most of the record of the past which they make known to him would 
have been ancient history then. Most of the great types of ancient 
life show by their end:>ryology that they run back to simple and minute 
ancestors which lived at the surface of the ocean, and that the common 
meeting point must be projected back to a still more remote time, before 
these ancestors had become differential from each other. 

After we have traced each great line of modern animals as far back- 
ward as Ave can through the study of fossils, we still find these lines 
distinctly laid down. The Lower Cambrian Crustacea, for example, 
are as distinct from the Lower Cambrian echinoderms or pteropods or 
lamellibranchs or brachiopods as they are from these of the present day, 
but zoology gives us evidence that the early steps in the establishment 
of these great lines were taken under conditions which were essentially 
different from those which have prevailed, without any essential change 
from the time of the oldest fossils to the present day, and that most of 
the great lines of descent were represented in the remote past by ances- 
tors, which, living a different sort of life, differed essentially, in struc- 
ture as well as in habits, from the representatives of the same ty])es 
which are known to us as fossils. 

In the echinoderms we have a well-defined type represented by 
abundant fossils, very rich in living forms, very diversified in its 
modification, and therefore well fitted for use as an illustration. This 
great stem contains many classes and orders, all constructed on the 
same plan, which is sharply isolated and quite unlike the plan of struc- 
ture in any other group of animals. All through the series of fossilifer- 
ous rocks echinoderms are found, and their plan of structure is always 
the* same. Paleontology gives us most valuable evidence regarding 
the course of evolution within the limits of a class, as in the crinoids 
or the echinoids; but we appeal to it in vain for light upon the organiza- 
tion of the primitive echinoderm or for connecting links between the 
classes. To our questions on these subjects, and on the relation of 
the echinoderms to other animals, paleontology is silent, and throws 
them back upon us as unsolved riddles. 



362 THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 

The zoolog-ist iiiilicsitatiiigly projects his imagination, held in check 
only by the laws of scientific thought, into the dark period before the 
times of the oldest fossils, and he feels absolutely certain of the past 
existence of a stem from Avhich the classes of echinoderms have 
inherited the fundamental ]»lan of their structure. He affirms with 
equal confidence that the structural changes which have separated this 
ancient type from the classes which we know from fossils are very much 
more profound and extensive than all the changes which each class has 
undergone from the earliest paleozoic times to the present day. He is 
also disi>()sed to assume, but, as I shall show, with much less reason 
that the amount of change which structure has undergone is an index 
to the length of time which the change has required, and that the 
period which is covered by the fossiliferous rocks is only an inconsid- 
erable part of that which has been consumed in the evolution of the 
echinoderms. 

The zoologist does not check the flight of his scientific nnagination 
here, however, for he trusts iinjdicitly to the embryological evidence 
which teaches him that still farther back in the i)ast all echinoderms 
were represented by a minute floating animal which was not an echino- 
derm at all in any sense except the ancestral one, although it was dis- 
tinguished by features which natural selection has converted, under 
the influence of modern conditions, into the structure of echinoderms. 
He finds in the embryology of modern echinoderms phenomena. which 
can bear no interpretation but this, and he unhesitatingly assumes 
that they are an inheritance which has been handed down from genera- 
tion to generation through all the ages from the prehistoric times of 
zoology. 

Other groups tell the same story with equal clearness. A lingula is 
still living in the sand bars and mud flats of the Chesapeake Bay 
under conditions which have not eflected any essential change in its 
structure since the time of the Lower Cambrian. Who can look at a 
living lingula without being overwhelmed by the efl'ort to grasp its 
immeasurable antiquity; by the thought that while it has passed 
through all the chances and changes of geological history, the struc. 
ture which fltted it for life on the earliest paleozoic bottom is still 
adapted for a life on the sands of the modern sea floor 1 

The everlasting hills are the type of venerable anticpiity; but lingula 
has seen the continents grow up, and has maintained its integrity 
unmoved by the convulsions which have given the crust of the earth 
its i)resent form. 

As measured by the time-standards of the zoologist lingula itself is 
modern, for its life history still holds locked up in its embryology tbe 
record, repeated in the development of each individual, of a structure 
and a habit of life which were lost in the unknown ]>ast at the time of 
the Lower Cambrian, and it tells ns vaguely but unmistakably of life 
at the surface of the i)rimitive ocean at a time when it was represented 
by minute and simple floating ancestors. 



THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 3G3 

Broa<lly stated, the history of each great line lias been like that of 
the echinoderiiis and brachiopods. The oldest pteropod or lanielli- 
branch or echinoderni or crnstaceaii or vertebrate which we know from 
fossils exhibits its own tyjie of strncture with perfect distinctness, and 
later intluences have done no more than to expand and diversify the 
type, while anatomy fails to gnide ns back to the point where these 
various lines met each other in a common source, although it forces us 
to believe that the common source, once had an individual existence. 
Embryology teaches that each line once had its own representative at 
the surface of the ocean, and thnt the early stages in its evolution have 
passed away and left no record in the rocks. 

If we try to call before the mind a picture of the land sui-face of the 
earth we see a vast expanse of verdure stretching from high up in 
the mountains over hills, valleys, and plains, and through forests and 
meadows down to the sea, with only an occasional lake or broad river 
to break its uniformity. 

Our i^icture of the ocean is an empty waste, stretching on and on 
with no break in the monotony except now and then a Hying fish or a 
wandering sea bird or a tioating tuft of sargassum, and we never think 
of the oceaji as the home of vegetable life. It contains plant-like ani- 
mals in abundance, but these are true animals and not plants, although 
they are so like them in form and color. At Nassau, in the Bahama 
Islands, the visitor is taken in a small boat, with windows of plate 
glass set in the bottom, to visit the " sea gardens" at the inner end of 
a channel through which the pure water from the open sea tiows 
between two coral islands into the lagoon. Here the true reef corals 
grow in quiet water, where they may l)e visited and exannned. 

When illuminated by the vertical sun of the Tropics and by the light 
which is reflected back from the white bottom, the pure, transparent 
water is as clear as air, and the smallest object 40 or 50 feet down is 
distinctly visible through the glass bottom of the boat. 

As this glides over the great mushroom shaped coral domes which 
arch up from the depths, the dark grottoes between them and the caves 
under their overhanging tops are lighted up by the sun, far down among 
the anthozoa or flower animals and the zoophytes or animal plants, 
which are seen through the waving thicket of brown and purple sea 
fans and sea feathers as they toss before the swell from the open ocean. 

There are miles of these "sea gardens" in the lagoons of the Baha- 
mas, and it has been my good fortune to spend many months studying 
their wonders, but no description can convey any conception of their 
beauty and luxuriance. The general eft'ect is very garden-like, and the 
beautiful fishes of black and golden yellow and iridescent-cobalt blue 
liover like birds among the thickets of yellow and lilac gorgonias. 

The parrot fishes seem to be cropping the plants like rabbits, but 
more careful examination shows that they are biting off the tips of the 
gorgonias and branching madrepores or hunting for the small Crustacea 



364 THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 

which hide in tlie t]ii<;ket and that all the aj)parent plants are really 
animals. 

The delicate star-like tiowers are the vermilion heads of boring anne- 
lids or the scarlet tentacles of actinias, and the thicket is made up of 
pale lavender l)ushes of branching- madrepores, and green and brown 
and yellow and oli ve masses of brain coral, of alcyonarians of all shades 
of yellow and purple, lilac and red, and of black and brown and red 
sponges. Even the lichens which incrust the rocks are hydroid corals, 
and the whole sea garden is a dense jungle of animals, where i)lant 
life is represented only by a few calcareous alga^ so strange in shape 
and texture that they are much less plant-like than the true animals. 

The scarcity of plant life becomes still more notable Avhen ayc study 
the ocean as a whole. On land herbivorous animals are always much 
more abundant and prolific than the carnivora, as they must he to keep 
up the supply of food, but the animal life of the ocean shows a most 
remarkable ditference, for uuirine animals are almost exclusively car- 
nivorous. 

The birds of the ocean, the terns, gulls, petrels, divers, cormorants, 
tropic birds and albatrosses, are very numerous indeed, and the only 
parallel to the pigeon roosts and rookeries of the laiul is found in the 
dense clouds of sea birds around their breeding grounds, but all these 
sea birds are carnivorous, and even the birds of the seashore subsist 
almost exclusively ui)on animals such as mollusca, Crustacea, and 
annelids. 

The seals pursue and destroy fishes; the sea elephants and walruses 
live upon mollusks; the whales, dolphins and porpoises and the marine 
reptiles all feed upon animals and most of them are fierce beasts of prey. 

There are a few fishes which i)asture in the fringe of seaweed which 
grows on the shore of the ocean, and there are some which browse 
among the floating tufts of algiv upon its surface, but most of them fre- 
quent these places in search of the small animals which hide among the 
plants. . 

In the Chesapeake Bay the sheepshead browses among the alga* upon 
the submerged rocks and piles like a marine sheep, but its food is 
exclusively animal, and I have lain upon the edge of a wharf watching 
it crunch the barnacles and young oysters until the juice of their bodies 
streamed out of the angles of its mouth and gathered a host of small 
fishes to snatch the fragments as they drifted away with the tide. 

Many important fishes, like the cod, pasture on the bottom, but their 
pasturage consists of mollusks and annelids and Crustacea instead of 
plants, and the vast majority of sea fishes are fierce hunters, ])ursuing 
and destroying snuiller fishes, and often exhibiting an insatiable love 
of slaughter, like our own bluefish and tropical albacore and barracuda. 
Others, such as the herring, feed upon smaller fishes and the pelagic 
pteropods and copepods; and others, like the shad, upon the minute 
organisms of the ocean, but all, with few exceptions, are carnivorous. 



THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 365 

III the other great groups of marine animals we find some scavengers, 
some which feed u[)on micro-organisms, and others which hunt and 
destroy each other, but there is no group of marine animals which cor- 
responds to the herbivora and rodents and the plant eating birds and 
insects of the land. 

There is so much room in the vast spaces of the ocean, and so much 
of it is hidden, that it is only when surface animals are gathered to- 
gether that the abundance of marine life becomes visible and impres- 
sive; but some faint conception of the boundless wealth of the ocean 
may be gained by observing the quickness with which marine animals 
become crowded together at the surface in favorable weather. On a 
cruise of more than two weeks along the edge of the Gulf Stream I 
was surrounded continually night and day by a vast army of dark- 
brown jelly-fish {Linerges mercutia), whose dark color made them very 
conspicuous in the clear water. We could see them at a distance from 
the vessel, and at noon, when the sun was overhead, we could look down 
to a great depth through the center-board well, and everywhere, to a 
depth of 50 or 60 feet, we could see them drifting by m a steady pro- 
cession like motes in a sunbeam. We cruised through them for more 
than 500 miles and we tacked back and forth over a breadth of almost 
a hundred miles, and found them everywhere in such abundance that 
there were some in every bucketful of water which w^e dipped ui); nor 
is this abundance of life restricted to tropical waters, for Ilaeckel tells 
us that he met with such enormous masses of Limacina to the north- 
west of Scotland that each bucket of water contained thousands. The 
tendency to gather in crowds is not restricted to the smaller animals, 
and many species of raptorial fishes are found in densely packed banks. 

The fishes in a school of mackerel are as numerous as the birds in a 
flight of wild pigeons, and we are told of one school which was a wind- 
row of fish half a mile wide and at least 20 miles long. But while 
pigeons are plant eaters, the mackerel are rapacious hunters, pursuing 
and devouring the herrings as well as other animals. 

Herring swarm like locusts, and a herring bank is almost a solid 
wall. In 1879 three hundred thousand river herring were landed in a 
single haul of the seine in Albemarle Sound; but the herring are also 
carnivorous, each one consuming myriads of copepods every day. 

In spite of this destruction and the ravages of armies of medusje 
and siphonophores and pteropods the fertility of the copepods is so 
great that they are abundant in all parts of the ocean, and they are 
met with in numbers which exceed our power of comprehension. On 
one occasion the GhaUenger steamed for two days through a dense cloud 
formed of a single species, and they are found in all latitudes, from the 
Arctic regions to the Equator, in masses which discolor the water for 
miles. We know, too, that they are not restricted to the surface, and 
that the banks of copepods are sometimes more than a mile thick. 
When we reflect that thousands would find ample room and food in a 



366 THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 

piut of -water, one can form some faint conception of tlieir nniversal 
abundance. 

The organisms which are visible in the water of the ocean and on 
the sea bottom are almost universally engaged in devouring each other, 
and many of them, like the bluetish, are never satisfied with slaughter, 
but kill for mere si)ort. 

Insatiable rapacity nuist end in extermination unless there is some 
unfailing- supply, and as we lind no visible supply in the water of the 
ocean we must seek it with a microscope, which shows us a wonderful 
fauna made up of innumerable larvic and embryos and small animals, 
but these things can not be the food supply of the ocean, for no carniv- 
orous animal could subsist very long by devouring its own chddrcn. 
The total amount of these animals is inconsiderable, however, when 
comi)ared with the abundance of a few forms of i)rotozoa and proto- 
phytes, and both observation and deduction teach that the most 
important element in marine life consists of .some half dozen types of 
protozoa and unicellular plants; of globigerina and radiolarians, and 
of trichodesmium, i)yr()cystis, protococcus and the coccospheres rhab- 
dospheres and diatoms. 

Modern microscopic research has shown that these simple i)lants, 
and the globigerinic and radolarians which feed upon them, are so 
abundant and prolific that they meet all demands and supjily the food 
for all the auinuils of the ocean. This is the fundamental conception of 
marine biology. The basis of all the life in the modern ocean is found 
in the micro-organisms of the surface. 

This is not all. The sim})licity and abundance of the microscopic 
forms and their importance in the economy of nature show^ that the 
organic world has gradually taken sliape around them as its center or 
starting- point, and has been controlled by them. They are not only 
the fundamental food supi)ly, but the i)rimeval supply, which has deter- 
mined the whole course of the evolution of marine life. 

The i)elag-ic plant life of the ocean has retained its i)rimitive simplic- 
ity on account of the very favorable character of its environment, and 
the higher rank of the littoral vegetation and that of the land is the 
result of hardshi}!. 

On laud the mineral elements of plant food are slowly supplied, as 
the rains dissolve them; limited space brings crowding and competi- 
tion for this scanty supply; growth is arrested for a great part of each 
year by drought or cold; the diversity of the earth's surface demands 
diversity of structure and habit, and the great size and comj^licated 
structure of terrestrial plants are adaptations to these conditions of 
hardship. 

At the surface of the ocean the abundance and uniform distribution 
of mineral food in solution; the area which is available for plants; the 
volume of sunlight and the uniformity of the temperature are all favor- 
able to the growth of plants, and as each plant is bathed on all sides 



THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 367 

by a nutritive fluid, it is advantageous for the new plant-cells which 
are ibrmed by cell-multiplication, to separate from each other as soon 
as possible, in order to expose the whole of their surface to the water. 
Cell-aggregation, the first step toward higher organization, is therefore 
disadvantageous to the i)elagic i^lants, and as the environment at the 
surface of the ocean is so monotonous, there is little opportunity for an 
aggregation of cells to gain any compensating advantage by seizing* 
upon a more favorable habitat. The pelagic plants have retained their 
]»rimitive simplicity, and the most distinctive peculiarity of the micro- 
scopic food supply of the ocean is the very small number of forms which 
make up the enormous mass of individuals. 

All the animals of the ocean are dependent uj)on this supi)ly of 
jnicroscopic food, and many of them are adapted for preying upon it 
directly, but a review of the animal kingdom will show that no highly 
organized animal has ever been evolved at the surface of the ocean, 
although all depend upon the food supply of the surface. 

The animals which now find their home in the open waters of the 
ocean are, almost without exception, descendants of forms which lived 
upon or near the bottom, or along the seashore, or upon the land, and 
all the exceptions are simple animals of minute size. A review of the 
whole animal kingdom would take more space than we can spare, but 
it would show that the evidence from embryology, from comparative 
anatomy, and from j)aleontology all bears in the same direction and 
proves that every large and highly organized animal in the open ocean 
is descended from ancestors whose home was not open water but solid 
ground, either on the bottom or on the shore. Embryology also gives 
us good ground for believing that all these animals are still more 
remotely descended from minute and simple pelagic ancestors, and that 
the liistory of all the highly organized inhabitants of the water has 
followed a roundabout path from the surface to the bottom and then 
back into the water. When this fact is seen in all its bearings, and its 
full significance is grasped, it is certainly one of the most notable and 
instructive features of evolution. 

The food supply of marine animals consists of a few species of micro- 
scopic organisms which are inexhaustible and the only source of food 
for all the inhabitants of the ocean. The supply is primeval as well as 
inexhaustible, and all the life of the ocean has gradually taken shape 
in direct dependence upon it. In view of these t^icts we can not but 
be profoundly impressed by the thought that all the highly organized 
marine animals are products of the bottom or the shore or the land, 
and that while the largest animals on earth are pelagic the few which 
are primitively pelagic are small and simple. The reason is obvious. 
The conditions of life at the surface are so easy that there is little 
fierce competition, and the inorganic environment is so simple that 
there is little chance for diversity of habits. 

The growth of terrestrial plants is limited by the scarcity of food, 
but there is no such limit to the growth of pelagic plants or the animals 



368 THE ORIOxIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 

which feed on them, and while the balance of life is no doubt adjusted 
by competition for food this is never very fierce, even at the i)resent 
day, when the ocean swarms with highly organized wanderers from 
the bottom and the shore. Even now the destruction or escape of a 
microscopic pelagic oiganism depends upon the accidental proximity 
or remoteness of an enemy rather than upon defense or i)rotection, and 
survival is determined by space relations rather than a struggle for 
existence. 

The abundance of food is shown by the ease with which wanderers 
from the land, like sea birds, find places for themselves in the ocean, 
and the rapidity with which they spread over its whole extent. 

As a marine animal the insect Halobates must be very modern as 
compared with most pelagic forms, yet it has spread over all tropical 
and subtropical seas, and it may always be found skimming over the 
surface of mid-ocean as nuich at home as a Gerris in a pond. I never 
found it absent in the Gulf Stream Avhen conditions were favorable for 
collecting. 

The easy character of pelagic life is shown by the fact that the larvie 
of innumerable animals from the bottom and the shore have retained 
their pelagic habit, and I shall soon give reasons for believing that the 
larva of a shore animal is safer at sea than near the shore. 

There was little opportunity in the primitive i)elagic fauna and flora 
for an organism to gain superiority by seizing upon an advantageous 
site or by acquiring peculiar habits, for one place was like another, and 
peculiar habits could count for little in comparison with accidental 
space relations. After the fauna of the surface had been enriched by 
all the marine animals which have become secondarily adapted to 
pelagic life, competition wath those improved forms brought about 
improvements in those which were strictly pelagic in origin, like the 
siphonophores, and those wanderers li^om the bottom introduced another 
factor into the evolution of pelagic life, for their bodies have been 
utilized for jirotection or concealment and in other ways, and we now 
have fishes which hide in the poison curtain of Physalia, Crustacea 
which live in the pharynx of Salpa or in the mouth of the menhaden, 
barnacles and sucking fish fastened to whales and turtles, besides a 
host of external and internal parasites. The primitive ocean furnished 
no such opportunity, and the conditions of pelagic life must at first 
have been very simple, and while competition Avas not entirely absent 
the i)ossibilities of evolution must have been extremely limited and 
the progress of divergent modification very slow so long as all life was 
restricted to the waters of the ocean. 

There can be no doubt that floating life was abundant for a long 
period when tlie bottom was uninhabited. The slow geological cbanges 
by which tlie earth gradually assumed its present character present a 
boundless field for speculation, but there can be no doubt that the sur- 
face of the primeval ocean became, fit for living things long before the 



THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 369 

deejier waters or the sea tloor, and during this i^eriod the proper con- 
ditions for the production of large and comi)licated organisms did not 
exist, and even after the total amount of life had become very great it 
must have consisted of organisms of small size and simple structure. 

Marine life is older than terrestrial life, and as all marine life has 
shaped itself in relation to the pelagic food supply, this itself is the 
only form of life which is independent, and it must therefore be the old- 
est. Tliere must have been a long period in primeval times when there 
was a pelagic fauna and flora rich beyond limit in individuals, but 
made up of only a few simple types. During this time the pelagic 
ancestors of all the great groups of animals were slowly evolved, as 
well as other forms which have left no descendants. So long as life 
was restricted to the surface no great or rapid advancement, through 
the iniiuences which now modify species, was possible, and we know 
of no other influences which might have replaced them. We are there- 
fore forced to believe that the diilerentiation and improvement of the 
primitive flora and fauna was slow, and that, for a vast period of time, 
life consisted of an innumerable multitude of minute and simple pehigic 
organisms. During the time which it took to form the thick beds of 
older sedimentary rocks, the physical conditions of the ocean gradu- 
ally took their present form, and during a part, at least, of tliis period 
the total amount of life in the ocean nmy have been very nearly as great 
as it is now without leaving any permanent record of its existence, for 
no rapid advance took place until the advantages of life on the bottom 
were discovered. 

We must not think of the populating of the bottom as a physical 
problem, but as discovery and colonization, very much like the coloni- 
zation of islands. Physical conditions for a long time made it impossi- 
ble, but its initiation was the result of biological influences, and there 
is no reason why its starting point should necessarily be the point where 
the physical obstacles first disappeared. It is useless to si)eculate upon 
the nature of the physical obstacles; there is reason to think one of 
them, probably an important one, was the deficiency of oxygen in deep 
water. 

Whatever their character may have been they were all, no doubt, of 
such a nature that they lirst disappeared in the shallow water around 
the coast, but it is not probable that bottom life was lirst established 
in shallow water, or before the physical conditions had become favor- 
able at considerable depths. 

The sediment near the shore is destructive to most surfiice animals, 
and recent explorations have shown that a stratum of water of very 
great thickness is necessary for the complete develojiment of the float- 
ing microscopic fauna and flora, and it is a mistake to picture them as 
confined to a thin surface stratum. Pelagic plants probably flourished 
as far down as light penetrates, and pelagic animals are abundant at 
very great depths. As the earliest bottom animals must have depended 
SM 94 24 



370 THE ORIOIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 

directly upon the floating organisms for food, it is not probable that 
they first established themselves in shallow water, where the food sup- 
l)ly is botli scanty and mixed with sediment; nor is it probable that 
their establishment Mas delayed until the great depths had become 
favorable to life. 

The belts around elevated areas far enough from shore to be free 
from sediment, and deep enough to permit the pelagic fauna to reach 
its fnll development above them, are the most favorable spots, and 
paleontological evidence shows that they were seized upon very early 
in the history of life on the bottom. 

It is probable that colony after colony was establishe<l on the bottom 
and afterwards swept away by geological change like a cloud before 
the wind, and that the bottom fauna Avhich we know was not the first. 
Colonies which started in shallow water were exposed to accidents from 
M'hich those in great depths were free; and in view of onr knowledge of 
the permanency of the sea floor and of the broad outlines of the conti- 
uents, it is not impossible that the first fauna which became established 
in the deep zone around the continents may have persisted and given 
rise to modern animals. However this may be, we must regard this 
deep zone as the birthplace of the fauua which has survived, as the 
ancestral home ot all the improved metazoa. 

The effect of life upon the bottom is more interesting than the place 
where it began, and we are uow to consider its infinence upon animals,, 
all whose ancestors and competitors and enemies had previously been 
pelagic. The cold, dark, silent, quiet depths of the sea are monotonous 
compared with the land, but they introdnced many new factors iuto' 
the course of organic evolution. 

It is doubtful whether the animals which first" settled on the bottom 
secured any more food than floating ones, but they undoubtedly obtained 
it with less ettbrt, and were able to devote their suj)erfluous energy to 
growth and to multiplication, and thus to become larger and to increase 
in numbers faster than pelagic animals. Their sedentary life must have 
been favorable to both sexual and asexual multiplication, and the tend- 
ency to increase by budding must have been quickly rendered more 
active, aud one of the first results of life on the bottom must have been 
to promote the teudency to form connected cormi, aud to retain the cou- 
uection between the i)areut aud the bud until the latter was able to 
obtain its own food and to care for itself The animals which first 
acquired the habit of resting on the bottom soon began to multiply 
faster than their swimming allies, and their asexually produced progeny, 
remaining for a longer time attached to and nourished by the parent 
stock, were much more favorably placed for rapid growth. As the 
animals of the bottom live on a surface, or at least a thin stratum, 
while swimming animals are distributed through solid space, the rapid 
multiplication of bottom animals must soon have led to crowding and 
to competition, aud it quickly became harder and harder for new forms 



THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 371 

from the opeu water to force themselves in among the okl ones, and 
colonization soon came to an end. 

The great antiquity of all the types of structure vrhich are repre- 
sented among modern animals is therefore what we should expect, for 
after the foundation of the fauna of the bottom was laid it became, and 
has ever suice remained, difticult for new forms to establish themselves. 

Most of our knowledge of the sea bottom is from three sources: From 
dredgings and other explorations, from rocks which were formed beyond 
the immediate intiuence of continents, and from the patches of the 
bottom fauna which have gradually been brought near its surface by 
the growth of coral reefs, and from all these sources we have testimony 
to the density of the crowd of animals on favorable spots. IJeep-sea 
explorations give only the most scanty basis for a picture of the sea 
bottom, but they show that animal life may thrive with the dense luxuri- 
ance of tropical vegetation, and Sir Wy villa Thomson says he once 
brouglit up at one time on a tangle, which was fastened to a dredge, 
over twenty thousand specimens of a single sjiecies of sea-urchin. The 
number of remains of paleozoic crinoids and brachiopods and trilobites 
which are crowded into a single slab of fine-grained limestone is most 
astounding, and it testifies most vividly and forcibly to the wealth of 
life on the old sea floor. 

No descrii^tiou can convey any adeciuate conception of the boundless 
luxuriance of a coral island, but nothing else gives such a vivid picture 
of the capacity of the sea floor for supporting life. . Marine plants are 
not abundant on coral islands and the animals depend either directly 
or indirectly upon the pelagic food supply, so that their life is the same 
in this respect as that of animals in the deep sea far from land. 

The abundant life is not restricted to the growing edge of the reef, 
and the inner lagoons are often like crowded aquaria. At Nassau my 
party of eight persons found so much to study on a little reef in a lagoon 
close to our laboratory that we discovered novelties every day for four 
months, and our explorations seldom carried us beyond this little tract 
of bottom. Every inch of the bottom was carpeted with living animals, 
while others Avere darting about among the corals and gorgoiiias in all 
directions; but this was not all, for the solid rock was honeycombed 
everywhere by tubes and burrows, and when broken to pieces with a 
hammer each mass of coral gave us si)ecimens of nearly every great 
grouj) in the animal kingdom. Fishes, Crustacea, annelids, mollusca, 
echinoderms, hydroids and sponges could be picked out of the fragments 
and the abundance of life inside the solid rock was most wonderful. 

The absence of pelagic life in the landlocked water of coral islands 
is as impressive and noteworthy as the luxuriance of life upon and near 
the bottom. 

On my first visit to the Bahama Islands I was sadly disappointed by 
the absence of pelagic animals where nil the conditions seemed to bo 
X)eculiarly favorable. 



372 THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 

The deep ocean is so near that, as oBeciuises through the inner sounds 
past the openings between the islets which form the outer barrier, 
the deep blue water of mid-ocean is seen to meet the white sand of the 
beach, and soundings show that the outer edge is a precipice as high 
as the side of Chimborazo aiul much steeper. 

Nowhere else in the world is the pure water of the deep sea found 
nearer land or more free from sediment, and on the days when the 
weather was favorable for ontside collecting we found siphonoi^hores 
and pteropods, pelagic mollusks and Crustacea and tunicates and all 
sorts of pelagic larv;e in great abundance in the open water just outside 
the inlets. 

Inside the barrier the water was always calm, and day after day it 
was as smooth as the surface of an inland lake. When I first entered 
one of these beautiful sounds, where the calm, transparent water 
stretches as far the eye can reach, while new beauties of islets and 
winding channels open before one as those which are passed fade away 
on the horizon, I felt sure that I liad at last ibund a place where the 
pelagic fauna of mid-ocean could be gatliered at our door and studied on 
shore. The water proved to be not only as pure as air but almost as 
empty. At high water we sometimes captured a few pelagic animals 
near the inlets, but Me dragged our surface nets through the sounds day 
after day only to find them as clean as if they had been hung in the 
Avind to dry. The water in which Ave washed them usually remained as 
l^ure and empty as if it had been filtered, and we often returned from 
our touring expeditions without even a copepod or a zoea or a pluteus. 

The absence of the floating larvie is most remarkable, for the sounds 
swarm with bottom animals which give birth every day to millions of 
swimming larva'. The mangrove swamps and the rocky shoies are 
fairly alive with crabs carrying eggs at all stages of development, and 
the boat passes over great black i)atches of sea-urchins crowded 
together by thousands. The number of animals engaged in laying 
their eggs or hatching their young is infinite, yet we rarely captured 
any larvae in the tow net, and most of these we did find were Avell 
advanced and nearly through their larval life. 

It is often said that the water of coral sounds is too full of lime to 
be inhabited by the animals of the open o(;ean, but this is a mistake, 
for the Avater is perfectly fit for supporting the most delicate and sensi- 
tive animals, and those Avhich we caught outside lived in the house in 
water from the sounds better than in any other place Avhere I ever tried 
to keep them, and instead of being injurnms the pure water of coral 
sounds is peculiarly favorable for use in aquaria for surface animals. 

The scarcity of fioating organisms can have only one explanation. 
They are eaten up, and comj)etition for food is so fierce that nearly 
e\"ery organism which is swept in by the tide and nearly CA^ery larva 
which is born in the sounds is snatched by the tentacles around some 
hungry mouth. 



THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 373 

[N^othing- could illustrate tlie lierceness of tlie struggle for food among 
tlie animals on a crowded sea bottom more vividly than the emptiness 
of the water in coral sounds where the bottom is practically one enor- 
mous mouth. The only larva^ which have much chance to establish 
themselves for life are those which are so fortunate as to be swept out 
into the open ocean, where they can complete their larval life under the 
milder competition of the pelagic fauna, and while it is usually stated 
that the larva^ of bottom animals have retained the pelagic habit for 
the purpose of distributing tbe species, it is more probable that it has 
been retained ou account of its comj>arative safety. 

These facts show that competition must have come (juickly after the 
establishment of the first fauna on the bottom, and that it soon became 
very rigorous and led to severe selection and rajnd modification; and 
we must also remember that life on the bottom brought with it many 
new opportunities for divergent specialization and imi)rovement. The 
increase in size which came with economy of energy increased the possi- 
bilities of variation and led to the natural selection of pecnliarities which 
improved the efficacy of the various parts of the body in their functions 
of relation to each other, and this has been an important factor in the 
evolution of complicated organisms. 

The- new mode of life also permitted the acquisition of protective 
shells, hard-supporting skeletons, and other imperishable parts, and 
it is therefore probable that the history of evolution in later times 
gives no index as to the period which was required to evolve from small, 
simple pelagic ancestors the oldest animals which were likely to be pre- 
served as fossils. 

Life on the bottom also introduced another inqiortant evolutionary 
influence — competition between blood-relations. In thoseanimals which 
we know most intimately, divergent modification^ with the extinction of 
connecting forms, results from the fact that the fiercest competitors of 
each animal are its closest allies, which, having the same habits, living 
upon the same food, and avoiding enemies in the same way, are con- 
stantly striving to hold exclusive possession of all that is essential to 
their welfare. 

When a stock gives rise to two dfvergent branches, each escapes 
competition with the other so far as they differ in structure or habits, 
while the i^arent stock competing with both at a disadvantage is exter- 
minated. 

Among the animals which we know best, evolution leads to a branch- 
ing tree-like genealogy, with the topmost twigs represented by living 
animals, while the rest of the tree is buried in the dead past. The 
connecting form between two species must therefore be sought in 
the records of the past or reconstructed by comparison. Even at the 
present day things are somewhat diflerent in the open ocean, and they 
must have been very different in the primitive ocean, for a pelagic 
animal has no fixed home, one locality is like another, and the compet-

itors aud enemies of each individual are determined in great part by 
accidents. We accordingly iind, even now, that the evolution of 
pelagic animals is often linear instead of divergent, and ancient forms, 
such as the sharks, often live on si<le by side with the later and more 
evolved forms. The radiolarians and medusje and siphonophores fur- 
uish many well-known illustrations of this feature of pelagic life. 

No naturalist is surprised to find in the South Pacific or in the Indian 
Ocean a Saliva or a pelagic crustacean or a surface fish or a whale which 
was previously known only from the North Atlantic, and the list of 
species of marine animals which are found in all seas is a very long- 
one. The fact that pelagic animals are so independent of those laws of 
geographical distribution which limit land animals is additional evi- 
dence of the easj^ character of the conditions of pelagic life. 

One of the first results of life on the bottom was to increase a sexual 
nuiltiplication and to lengthen the time during which l)uds remain 
united to and nourished by their parents, and to crowd individuals of 
the same species together and to cause comi^etition between relations. 
We have in this and other obvious peculiarities of life on the bottom a 
sufficient explanation of the fiict that since the first establishment of 
the bottom fauna, evolution has resulted in the elaboration and diver- 
gent si)ecialization of the types of structure which w^ere already estab- 
lished rather than the production of new types. 

Another result of the struggle for existence on the bottom was the 
escape of varieties from competition with their allies by tiight from the 
crovrded spots and a return to the open water above; just as in later 
tinfes the Avhales and sea birds have gone back from the land to the 
ocean. 

These emigrants, like the civilized men who invade the homes of 
peaceful islanders, brought with them the improvements which had 
come from fierce competition, and they have carried everything before 
them and i)roduced a great change in the pelagic fauna. 

The rapid intellectual development whicli has taken place among the 
mammals since the Middle Tertiary, and the rapid structural changes 
which took place in animals and ])lants when the land fauna and Hora 
were established, are well known, but the fact that the discovery of the 
bottom initiated a much earlier and probably more important era of 
rapid development in the forms of animal life has never been pointed out. 

If this view is correct the i^rimitive fauna of the bottom must have 
had the following characteristics: 

(1) It was entirely animal, without plants, and it at first depended 
directly upon the pelagic food supply. 

(2) It was established around elevated areas in Avater deep enough 
to be beyond the influence of the shore. 

(."'>) The great groups of animals were rapidly established from pelagic 
ancestors. 

(4) The animals of the bottom rapidly increased in size and hard 
parts were quickly acquired. 



THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 375 

(5) The bottom fauna soon produced progressive development among 
pelagic animals. 

(G) After tlie establishment of the fauna of the bottom elaboration 
and diftereutiation among the rei^resentatives of each primitive type 
soon set in and led to the extinction of connecting forms. 

Many of the oldest fossils like the pteropods are the modified 
descendants of ancestors with hard parts, and there is no reason to 
supjiose that the lirst animals whicli were capable of preservation as 
fossils have been discovered, but it is interesting to note that the oldest 
known fauna is an unmistakable a])proximation to the primitive fauna 
of the bottom. 

The Lower Cambrian fossils are distributed through strata more 
than 2 miles thick, some, at least, of them showing by their tine grain 
and by the perfect preservation of tracks and burrows which were 
made in soft mud, and of soft animals like jelly-fish, that they were 
deposited in water of considerable depth. The sediment was laid down 
slowly and gently in water so dee]) as to be free from disturbance and 
under conditions so fiivorable that it contains the remains of delicate 
animals not often found as fossils. 

While the fauna of the Lower Cambrian undoubtedly lived in water 
of very considerable depth, it was not oceanic but continental, for we 
are told by Walcott that ''one of the most important conclusions is 
that the fauna of the Lower Cambrian lived on the eastern and west- 
ern shores of a continent that in its general configuration outlines the 
American continent of to-day." " Htrictly speaking, the fauna did not 
live upon the outer shore facing the ocean, but on the shores of interior 
seas, straits or lagoons that occupied the intervals between the several 
ridges that ran from the central i)latform east and west of the main 
continental land surface of the time. 

This fauna was rich and varied, but it was not self supporting, for 
no fossil i)lants are found, and the primary food supply was j)elagic. 
Animals adapted for a rapacious life, such as the pteropods, were 
abundant, and prove the existence of a rich supply of pelagic animals. 
All the forms known from the fossils are either carnivorous, like the 
medusa-, corals, Crustacea, and trilobites, or they are adapted, like the 
sponges, brachiopods, and lamellibranchs, for straining minute organ- 
isms out of the water or for gathering those whicli rained down from 
above, and the conditions under which they lived were very similar to 
those on the bottom at the present day. 

Walcott's studies show that the earliest known fauna had the follow- 
ing characteristics: It consisted, so far as the record shows, of animals 
alone, and these were dependent upon the pelagic food supply for sur- 
port. While small in comparison with many modern animals, they 
were gigantic compared with primitive pelagic animals. The species 
were few, but they represent a very wide range of types. All these 
types have modern representatives, and most of the modern types are 



376 THE ORIGIN OF THE OLDEST FOSSILS. 

represented in the Lower Cambrian. Their home was not the bottom 
of the deep ocean, bnt the shores of a continent nnder water of consid- 
erable depth. 

The Cambrian fauna is usually regarded as a halfway station in a 
series of animal forms which stretches backward into the past for an 
immeasurable period, and it is even stated that the history of life 
before the Cambrian is larger by many fold than its history since. kSo 
far as this opinion rests on the diversity of types in Cambrian times, 
it has no good basis; for if the views here advocated are correct tlie 
evolution of the ancestral stems took place at the surface, and all the 
conditions necessary for the rapid production of types were pre.sent 
when tlie bottom fauna first became established. 

As we i)ass backward toward the Lower Cand)rian we tind closer and 
closer agreement with the zoological conception of the character of 
primitive life on the bottom. While we can not regard the oldest fauna 
which has been discovered as the first which existed on the bottom, we 
may feel confident that the first fauna, of the bottom resembled that of 
the Lower Cambrian in its physical conditions and in its most distinc- 
tive pecnliarities — the abundance of types, and the slight amount of 
dillerentiation among the representatives of these tyi)es — and we must 
regard it as a decided and unmistakable ai>proximation to the begin- 
ning of the modern fauna of the earth, as distinguislied fiom the more 
iiiicient and simple fauna of the oiJen ocean. 



THE RELATIOI^S OF PHYSIOLOGY TO CHEMISTRY AND 

MORPHOLOGY.' 



By GiULio Fano. 



Owing" to atlvances in nietliods of researcb, to the increase in the 
aggieoate of facts acquired by science, and to the ever more thorough 
study of scientific systems concerning living beings, we have become 
more and more exacting as to the interpretations — always, unfortu 
nately, doubtful — to be given to physiological facts. We have sought 
to replace the theory of vital force by a physico chemical theory of life; 
to put in the place of a mysterious and impalpable entity a confusion of 
material elements, which in their turn assume mysterious aud impon- 
derable characters as soon as we attempt to define them in any way. 

But while it is true that the fundamental doctrine of i^hysics and 
chemistry could not itself stand a searching analysis, yet there is no 
doubt that it represents in the hierarchy of science the higher grade of 
development now attained by our methods of investigation. The rapid 
progress of these branches of science is probably chiefly due to the 
relative simplicity of the problems with which they have to deal, but in 
any case they are considered as the rational basis of a considerable 
number of researches undertaken by physiology for the purpose of 
defining scientifically the phenomeua of life. Let us not forget, how- 
ever, that physics and chemistry ha\e yet far to go before they become 
free, if indeed they ever do, from the shackles of empiricism; before 
they are able to reduce every phenomenon to the simple expression of 
time, space, and force, aud to the derivatives therefrom — energy, veloc- 
ity, and mass; and that under the names attraction, affinity, conducti- 
bility, etc., are hidden things no less obscure thau are the phenomena 
of life. However this may be, since we can not conceive of a mechan- 
ical basis of psychic facts, we ought nevertheless to admit that, with the 
exception of consciousness, all expressions of function, infinite and com- 
plex as they are, may be comprehended among physico chemical phe-

nomena, if we allow that the physics and cheiiiistry iuvolved have 
special characters of their own, and that they freqnently are meclian- 
ical in their operations, and that the effects produced by them are of a 
quite x)cculiar nature. 

It was in accordance with the natural development of human thought 
that physiologists should iirst be led to examine the physical phe- 
nomena of life, or to look to physics for explanations by analogy, and 
that, in spite of the most serious objections, it was only later that they 
took np the chemical side of bioh)gical (piestions, trying" to give a con- 
cejition of them based upon the mechanism of atoms. In short, it may 
be said that since that has been done many problems of physiology are 
treated from the standpoint of chemistry, and that we resort to that 
science for what many believe to be the latest intelligence concerning 
the manifestations of life, 

A quite characteristic exami»le of the development of the general 
ideas that controlled and still control physiology is found, among many 
others, in the theory which attempts to account for a phenomenon of 
great interest, and now nuich studied, that of inhibition. You know 
that by inhibition Ave designate the arrest of a functional act induced 
by an antagonistic act, but not, as in i)aralysis, by suppressing totally 
or in part the conditions producing the phenomenon. We have a well- 
known example of it in the action of the pneumogastric nerve npon 
the heart. Whenever that nerve is excited by a sufHciently powerful 
stimulant, the movements of the heart cease, returning again as soon 
as the excitation is withdrawn or the force of the nerve exhausted. In 
this case we have produced by means of an excitant a nervous vibra- 
tion, which, elaborated in certain ganglia situated in the substance of 
the heart, neutralizes the action of the excito-motor cells. This con- 
clusive experiment, first made in 1840 by the brothers Weber,' enconn- 
tered objections based, it nnist be confessed, upon a prejudice arising 
from the systematic notions then in vogue. At that time physiology 
was at a period of its history when, imbued by somewhat crude mate- 
rial conceptions, it was alleged that everything could be simplilied so 
as to reduce every movement to a retlex act. So it was denied tliat 
there could be found in our organism any other than sensory and motor 
fibers. 

We ought to add that the philosophical tendency of that time had 
great force, for among those who refused to allow that the experiment 
of Weber had any special importance were two of the most illustrious 
names of modern physiology." But other acts of restraint were found 
besides the inhibition of the heart, so that the opposition could no 
longer be maintained, especially when it was found that in the nervous 
centers themselves there occur inhibitory processes, in which, as we

shall presently see, we must look for the definite physiological basis of 
thought. 

Cue of the first explanations proposed for inhibition in the realm of 
theoretical jiliysiology was, as might have been expected, purely phys- 
ical in its character. It was thought that its phenomena might be 
considered as analogous to those classed under interference. You 
know that the union of two sounds may produce silence, and that from 
two rays of light we may derive darkness. This occurs when the 
waves that theoretically constitute their material basis meet in such a 
way that the summit of one wave corresponds to the hollow of another 
so that they mutually neutralize each other. The beats and the rings 
of Newton are i^henomena of interference. Lauder lUninton,' following 
the footsteps of Bernard- and of Eomanes,^ tried with much skill to 
bring the phenomena of inhibition into the same category as those we 
have just cited. It would be very interesting' to follow the learned 
investigator in his defense of his doctrine, but I shall limit myself to 
stating that he founded his theory upon the supposition, which appears 
very probable in view of certain considerations, that in inhibition the 
nervous vibrations follow two paths of unequal length, then unite in a 
single one in which the parted waves again meet with opposite phases 
and consequently neutralize each other. As you will observe, this 
doctrine recalls at once the acoustic tubes invented by Herschel and 
then successfully constructed by (^>nincke and Konig.^ 

In short, Lauder Brunton holds that movement, sensation, inhibition, 
or stimulation are not absolute, but merely relative terms. According- 
to him the same cell may exercise inhibitory or excito-motor functions, 
according to the length of the waves of impulsion that pass to or from 
it, according to the distance which these impulsions traverse and the 
velocity with which they travel. The English exi)erimenter endeavored 
also to find a mori:)hological basis for his doctrine in the two jn'olonga- 
tioiis, one straight and the other spiral, with which certain nerve cells 
are lU'ovided. This hypothesis is, as you see, inspired solely by phys- 
ical conceptions which demand a structural form, but, however ingeni- 
ous it may be, it does not account for the facts, and we now admit that 
acts of inhibition are processes essentially chemical in character. 

Permit me to lay some stress upon this argument, for it will afford us 
an opportunity of touching upon several questions of fundamental 
importance in physiological studies. 

From a chemical point of view the functions of a living being maybe 
included in two great categories. The first embraces the destructive, 
analytic, catabolic, or disintegrating acts by which the individual in

question liberates energy in the form of lieat, electricity, etc. ; the sec- 
ond embraces synthetic, anabolic, or restorative acts by which there 
becomes accumulated in the tissues under the form of exi>losive or 
reserve materials the force necessary for the functions that develop 
or reestablish the dynamical and histological losses they have suft'ered. 

Living matter is, to use a comparison of Hering,' like a copper wire 
immersed in a solution of sulphate of copper, which, when conductiug 
an electric current, loses on the one hand a portion of its substance by 
solution, on the other accumulates an additional amount of metal. 
These antagonistic functions have within oiir organism a close correla- 
tion, being united in an intimate solidarity from which results that 
dynamic and material stability that gives to a tissue its mori)hological 
character. This solidarity has, in my o[)inion, among its other control- 
ling conditions, a very important chemical basis. - 

You know that exercise develops organs and tliat this fact is con- 
firmed throughout the entire sphere of our functions. Thus it is that 
muscles enlarge in consequence of rei)eated movements, that glands 
increase in size when obliged to perform nnusual work, that in other 
terms function develops the organ through which it acts. We here 
enter upon a functional circle which might in logic be called a vicious 
circle, but which gives admirable results from a teleological point of 
view. 

In a word, while an organ develops by exerting its functions, this 
very development makes it more and more capable of performing those 
functions. This relation, universally recognized, finds its applicatidu 
in the doctrine of evolution and helps much to explain to us those mar- 
velous progressions and difl'erentiations of structure by Mhich amor- 
phous protoplasm is transformed into a complex organism. But when 
we say that an organ develops by executing its functions, or that func- 
tion makes the organ, we content ourselves with enunciating a tact 
without explaining tlie mechanism to Miiich it is due. Let us try, 
however, to throw light on some of the conditions that determine the 
above-mentioned relations between an organ and its function. 

We are able to determine with considerable accuracy the stiunilants 
that cause an organ to act, and that these are found partly in the 
environment of the organism, partly in the interstitial blastema that 
surrounds the tissues, partly within the elements of the tissues. All 
our activities may therefore be classed as reflex acts, pseudo-automatic 
acts and automatic acts properly so called. We also know that the 
processes of molecular destruction that form the chemical basis of our 
functional acts are frequently followed by a corresponding and pro- 
portional amount of work of restoration, but we are ignorant of the 
nature of the internal impulses that cause the tissues to restore them-

selves. Now, from some of my studies, it seems to me that one may 
conclude that stimulants to the nutritive activities for organic restora- 
tion consist, in certain cases, at least, in the by-j)roducts, the scoriae, 
the cinders that result from functional activity. 

These catabolic i)roducts gradually accumulate in the tissues and 
pass from thence into the blood, which, continually circuhxting, trans- 
ports them to the glands, by which they are again worked over and 
tinally eliminated. It appears that it is precisely these by-products, 
produced by our tissues when in activity, that give to nutritive phe- 
nomena the impulse that excites to a renewal of the energy spent in 
function, which leads the organ accomplishing a work to develop and 
adapt itself to new demands of the individual and the environment. 
In order to understand my assertion it must be remembered that the 
tissues are never completely at rest ; that, on the contrary, as to mate- 
rial matters they are constantly changing and are being ceaselessly, 
though slowly, consumed; even when they show no internal evidence of 
function. Yet the by-products occurring during this apparent func- 
tional repose do not suflice to proj)erly maintain, or rather are not 
suitable for setting up, this work of reconstruction, since an inactive 
organ decreases, atrophies, and may be reduced to a rudimentary 
state. When, on the contrary, it remains active, it maintains itself in 
nutritive equilibrium, and increases in proportion to its greater or less 
functional activity. This arises, at least in part, from the fact that 
the by-products of the function ex(;ite to restorative work greater in 
amount than the destruction that occurred during the period of activ- 
ity, in fact, if an organ that only occasionally acts does not atrophy, 
it is because that during its action it establishes such a stinuilation to 
nutrition that it compensates not only for the losses occasioned by 
activity, but also for those occurring during repose. Thus scientific 
sanction is given to a fact of daily experience, viz: that an organ is 
kept in good nutritive condition by a proper alternation of work and 
rest. It is also seen why increased activity of the function of an organ 
leads to its hypertrophy. Increase of work i^roduces, indeed, such an 
amount of nutritive stimulation that, as a logical consequence of what 
has been said, the losses that preceded the period of activity as well as 
those which arise from it will not only be made good, but restored with 
usury, and the organ will consequently be in a better nutritive condi- 
tion than before. That is of course within physiological limits, for 
excessive activity leads to tliose phenomena of auto-intoxication which 
are collectively designated under the term fatigue. 

It is likewise certain that the chemical mechanism which I have now 
brietly sketched out for you includes but one side of the question, and 
that it is necessary to consider another which concerns itself with 
moii)ho1ogical phenomena. The chemical elaborations by which tissues 
dev«'l(>i> give rise to molecular i)olarizations, from which results the 
structure <>f living beings.

We may tlius suppose that structural adjustmeuts are formed keep- 
ing i)ace with the fuudauieutal improvemeut of tbe nervous centers 
which are working' and dev^elopmg, such adjustmeuts becoming mani- 
fest as special modifications of the nerves.' 

Besides the basis of a cliemical nature of which I luive spoken, 
destructive and constructive plienomena owe their reciprocal solidarity 
to the nervous system, whicli combines with each other the different 
organs and tissues, and, modifying their respective attitudes, unites 
them in a homogeneous and stal)le whole. 

Tliat the nervous system presides over destructive functions has 
long been known. We know, indeed, that almost all the movements 
of our organism originate from impulses that start from the motor 
centers and induce modifications of form accompanied by manifesta- 
tions of energy due to an increase iu the destructive processes in the 
contractile tissues. Thus when a motor nerve is stimulated it produces 
in muscle an exaggerated chemical action that leads to a destruction 
of the contractile tissue. In other terms, a motor nerve is an analytic 
or catabolic nerve. 

Let us consider now the i)rocesses of inhibition. We have already 
stated that the fibers of the pneumogastric nerve that supply the 
heart muscle, have an inhibitory function, and can not for that reason 
be i)laced in the same category as the motor or catabolic fibers. We 
will now say, on the other hand, that there are many facts that show 
that inhibition is the result of an increase in the synthetic processes of 
organic restoration, and hence relates to a diminution of catabolic 
acts, a decrease of molecular destruction.^ 

In this way the energy set at liberty by impulses acting on the motor 
nerves serves to increase the destructive acts in the interior of the tis- 
sues, and manifests itself externally under the form of motion, heat, 
electricity, etc. On the contrarj'^, that set in motion by the inhibitory

thetic forniation of great molecular comx)lexes, and, setting np restora- 
tive chemical processes, causes the diminution or cessation of functional 
acts of a disintegrating chemical character. 

In addition to these phenomena of inhibition, which we may term 
perii)heric, there are others of a central origin brought to light by the 
investigations of Setchenow, Guyon, Golsy, and others. These have 
shown that the nervous centers may exert a strong inhibitory action 
upon reflex acts in general, and even, according to some experiments of 
my own, upon the automatic activities of the medulla oblongata. This 
restraining action of the nervous centers is closely connected with the 
l)roblem of the physiological basis of thought.' In fact, the inhibitory 
processes oppose such a resistance to the nervous vibrations passing 
through the brain that impressions are necessarily arrested for a long 
time within the sphere of the sensorium, and may thus induce that 
associated series of conscious phenomena that lies above the sphere of 
mere sensation or motion. Besides, the restorative chemical character 
of the processes of inhibition explains to us the phenomena of memory, 
without which we Avould be unable to understand consciousness. The 
intensity of the psychical act is therefore in direct proportion to the 
force of the restraining act. It would take too long to refer, even in 
passing, to the importance of inhibition in all psychical operations. 
We will merely allude to the fact that education, M'hich contributes to 
form the character of the child, is valuable in proportion as it trains 
the capacity for controlling the instinctive impulses of human nature. 

Thus it is that, starting from the arrest of the movements of the heart, 
we may, by a gradual succession offsets and deductions, finally attack 
one of the most difficult, and certainly one of the highest, problems of 
physiology — that of the functional basis of thought. We can thus 
prove that both the simplest acts of the vegetative life of a tissue, as 
well as the most complex jpsychical nninifestations of a superior organ- 
ism, have for their essential basis chemical i^rocesses of the same nature. 

But we must not boast too much over these results; for while, in the 
concrete case we have cited, chemical antagonism helps to explain the 
relation between inhibition and movement, chemistry can not usually 
reveal the modus operandi of a functional act. 

From the chemical processes of our organism there are, as we have 
already said in another form, effects derived of two kinds — either liber- 
ation of energy in actions attended with the disengagement of heat or 
its accumulation in processes during which such disengagement does 
not take place. But if we were acquainted with the innumerable reac- 
tions that take place in our organism, which for the greater j^art are 
entirely unknown to us, we would yet have to find out how the energy

developed by til em is trausformed into function; liow, in tlie compli- 
cated meclianism of our tissues, it comes to manifest itself in tlie form 
of heat, electricity, muscular movement, secretion, and nervous activity. 
Is not tlie same coal burned in the different engines'? Yet liow many 
varied effects may be manifested by tliese different causes! Altliouiih 
tbe chemical basis of their function may be the same, does not that 
function remain invariable, even when the nature of the fuel consumed 
in the furnace varies"? Consider the immense variety of metabolisms of 
animals and plants; coippare that with the admirable functional unity 
of these beings, and tell me if that does not suffice to show how slight 
is the importance of chemical work in the development of a special 
function. 

All this appears to me to be forgotten by those who, impelled by that 
enthusiasm for system now so much in vogue, see in every organic func- 
tion a chemical tact and nothing else. We, on the contrary, recognize 
truly that chemical action is the cause of the energy dis]>layed, but we 
can not forget that function is self-determined, transforming that energy 
and presenting it under an infinite number of manifestations. 

The admirable researches of Eaoul Tictet' show clearly the share 
that in functional acts ought to be ascribed to chemical reactions and 
that Avhich should be given to the organization of the tissues. This 
experimenter has recently shown that a very low temperature — 100^ 
below zero — stops all chemical reaction, no matter what; even sulphuric 
acid and nitric acid no longer combine with soda, potash, and ammonia. 
These experiments .show that at absolute zero heterogeneous l)odics no 
longer react upon each other, whatever may be their affinities, for the 
reason, according to Pictet, that they have attained the limit of cohe- 
sion, and that no sufficient force brings the atoms near enough to each 
other to get them within the sphere of each other's activity. If, on the 
other hand, we keep living things in a refrigerating apparatus for a 
long time, it may be observed that after thawing they again resume 
their functions in an absolutely normal manner.' Pictet thus ol)tainsa 
complete restoration of the manifestations of life in bacilli and seeds 
kept at 200° below zero. Vibratile cilia that have supported a tempera- 
ture of 00° and fish that have been so frozen as to form a solid mass 
with the ice in which they are embedded and have become as brittle as 
glass may also be recalled to life. 

These experiments are of great importance, inasmuch as they demon- 
strate that an arrest of chemical activity in the tissues does not destroy 
the i^otential conditions of life, and that the latter finds the basis fi)r its 
continuity rather in the organization of the body, that is in its structural 
mechanism. To use a somewhat crude illustration, the usual relation 
of chemistry to the functional activity of a living being is like that of

coal to the work performed by a steam engine. By cooliug- the animal 
we may extiuguisli the tire in the fiirua,ce; its functious are suspended, 
but the mechanism that causes it to move is not, after all, destroyed, 
for if we again heat the organism which we have beeu cooling it will 
behave as the eugiue does when we relight its tire; the being on 
which we are experimenting will again resume its movements. "If we 
could," says Pictet,' "create an organized structure quite complete, 
but dead, physicochemical conditions would be sufficient to develop all 
the phenomena of vegetable life. Let us at once admit," he continues, 
"that i)sychic phenomena could never be produced nor explained by 
the simple movement of organized matter." It is a strange fact that 
diastases and the poisons known as ptomaines, unlike organized matter, 
appear to be much injured by great cold and lose their specific activities. 
Thus low temperatures effect a remarkable distinction between microbes 
and diastases, marking clearly the difference between chemical actions 
under the influence of organization and those not so controlled. 

Let us further observe how processes which in the interior of living 
tissues constitute the chemical basis of function, likewise occur exter- 
nally in reactions which have their origin in life as well as in dead tis- 
sues. These are processes that do not always lead to exactly similar 
chemical results, but which have a similar general catabolic character 
by which the very complex organic molecule, by means of oxidation or 
successive divisions, by hydration or reduction, mounts the scale of 
organic compounds and becomes by degrees more and more simple. 

The difference lies in this, that in living beings the kinetic effect 
resulting from chemical affinity manifests itself in a thousand diverse 
activities, while in dead tissues it is transformed almost wholly into 
heat, other forms of movement, more particularly those of a func- 
tional character, being totally arrested. 

This occurs because in dead tissues catabolic action likewise attacks 
the structural mechanism, and this makes the working of the organic 
machine impossible, while in the living organism the products that 
by their decomposition induce functions are, under normal conditions, 
almost wholly those inclosed within differentiated protoplasms, and if 
sometimes this activity is also exercised upon the tissues, they are 
rapidly and fully restored by metabolic processes. 

In short we ought to again recall that the chemistry of the tissues 
not only supplies fuel for the mechanical substratum of our functions, 
but is also used in constructing and restoring the organism. These 
assimilating processes are controlled by the special elective attitudes 
of each of the elements, and if they also have a chemical basis they 
yet find their determining cause in a long history of external reactions 
and internal adaptations by which is explained the gradual develop- 
ment of living beings and the place which an organism has fixed for 
itself in the hierarchy of organic forms.

386 PPIYSIOLOGY, CHEMISTRY, AND MORPHOLOGY. 

But here we enter the very obscure domain of the origin and develop- 
ment of life. You know how much the determining causes of heredity 
and evolution have been discussed, and how the Darwinian laws, 
although remaining fundamentally the same, have been profoundly 
modified as far as regards the conditions of their development. Wliile, 
for example, it would seem that we must not admit the hereditary 
transmission of acquired characters in animals, the study of the 
development of plants tends to change our too absolute ideas as to 
the relations between autogeny and phylogeny and to give to evolution 
a periodic character established by hereditj',' and by the influence of 
time and the environment. 

At all events it is always organization, independently of the causes 
by which it was or is determined, that fixes and molds the activities 
of an organism, although, in the causal succession of i)henomena, 
functional differentiations i)recede morphological differentiations, and 
are sometimes manifested in a tissue whose details can not be shown by 
our present means of investigation. Besides, even tlie so-called amor- 
phous protoplasm is developed little by little into a very complex 
whole, and it is even thought that it may be considered as a colony of 
microorganisms.^ 

The cell, according to this theory, loses its fundamental character of 
morphological unity and is supposed to be made up, like a higher 
organism, of a multitude of very much smaller units that probably 
differ from each other. Finally let us, with these, go beyond the woild 
actually cognizable by the senses, let us imagine an internal weft made 
up of unities still more minute and more simple that bear the same 
relation to organized forms as molecules do to inorganic matter. The 
structure of these elements and the morphological relations that unite 
them ought not, however, to be considered as the bed through which 
flows the torrent of life, but as the mechanism which elaborates and 
develops its manifestations. 

We know, besides, that the morphological element has no stable 
basis, and that it even becomes modified according to the various func- 
tions it has to perform. Thus it is that the anatomical changes of an 
element may sometimes inform us as to the condition of its nutrition, 
whether it has been in action or remained long at rest, and whether 
there are developing within it those mysterious processes by which a 
cell prepares for reproduction. From all this it clearly results that by 
the study of conditions and of the morphological modifications that 
determine, accompany, or follow a functional act, much more than by 
chemical researches, we can perhaps some day explain many a weighty 
problem of physiology, if not those fundamental processes character

isticof ;i living being by which energy is iiccumnhited and manifested, 
transformed and given its s[)ecial developments. For these morpho- 
logical facts express, as we have already said, elective activities slowly 
accumulated iu the infinite past which, associating themselves with the 
present chemical activities, give results that are unexpected iu i)ropor- 
tion as we are ignorant of tlic intimate nature of the organization. 

Thus Pfefler,' after having observed that active bacilli are attracted 
by peptone, l)y asparagine, by chloride of sodium, in short by many 
substances, while the zoospores of ferns are attracted by malic acid, and 
those of mosses by sugar of milk, and that the trillionthpartof a milli- 
gram is sufficient to iiroduce that attraction, grants that the observer 
might be led to conclude that there was here an act of volition rather 
than a simple chemical phenomenon. Because of this and of many other 
observations of a similar character, some authors regard the elective 
action of molecular organisms as the rudimentary expression of tastes 
and proclivities as Avell as the origin of certain idiosyncrasies and of 
the more or less localized action of certain poisons, so that even in the 
most simple phenomena of the nutritive activity of a tissue we encounter 
a problem of selection indissolubly bound up with that of thought, the 
origin of which is probably closely connected with that of life. 

To this may be added that not only do the chemical actions that 
occur in an organism have a peculiar quality; the conditions under 
which they occur are also special and peculiar to living beings — that is 
to say, to organization and its products. We can indeed reproduce some 
of these chemical processes that occur in the weft of our tissues, but to 
obtain similar results we are obliged to employ very strong electric cur- 
rents or reagents of such power that they would destroy any organism, 
no matter what. In organized beings, on the contrary, these effects 
are obtained at a temperature equal to or but a little above that of the 
environment, at ordinary atmospheric pressure, under the influence of 
currents so slight as to be hardly demonstrable, and by using chemical 
affinities of the most feeble power. 

What we have said hitherto, while indicating the limits of jjliysiolog- 
ical chemistry, detracts in no way from its great and real im})Ortance. 
It is sufficient to mention the new spheres for investigation now o])eu- 
ing — the metabolism of the tissues, the action of the blood glands, and of 
the sympathetic nerve, auto- intoxication and immunity — to show how 
vast is the field of practical action open to chemical research. It gives us 
occasion to note how organisms in their manifold adaptations use these 
affinities according to their varied conditions of existence, and how the 
chemical forces adapt themselves to the production of colors, to the 
distillation of perfumes, to the accumulation of substances, which, like 
explosives, amass in small volume a large amount of virtual energy; to 
the elaboration or materials of all kinds for the mechanical needs of

the organism, for the nutritive necessities of life, for the testhetic exi- 
gencies of sex. In all this chemistry has an immense field of fraittul 
research before it, and we sliall fln<l in the phenomena of living beings 
the desired instructions for making life easier, for improving and defend 
ing it, for rendering it sufficiently productive to permit us to practice 
that .social altruism that nature herself now prevents us from attaining. 
But this field is now and will remain more practical than theoretical, 
more utilitarian than scientific, because, even if the complicated i)roc- 
esses going on within the crucibles of life were well kuown to all, life 
itself would always remain for us unknown and impenetrable. IJut 
this ought not to deter us; we shall keej) on trying and testing, accu- 
mulating facts, pushing as far as possible our analytical researches, 
convinced that we should be content to seek truth without accjuiriug 
the whole of it. 

As you see, we are to-day already quite far from the systems in vogue 
a few years ago, and, knowing more, we realize more clearly how slight 
is the scope of our knowledge; for with increased knowledge comes an 
enlargement of our conception of the complexity of the plienomena of 
life; the horizon of the unknown widens out in vast relative proj)or- 
tions. For this reason permit me to believe that the moment is not 
yet at hand when the facts developed Avithin the living organism can 
receive an astronomic sanction, and let me recall to you what was said 
by Giiiileo, the founder of the experimental method, the regenerator 
of imtural philosophy: "I have always held him extremely rash who 
attempts to njeasure by human capacity all that nature can and will 
do, since there is not, on the contrary, a single effect in nature, how- 
ever small it may be, that can be entirely understood by the most pen- 
etrating intelligence. This idle presumption of wishing to understand 
everything must necessarily arise from never having understood any- 
thing; for if he had ever applied Jiimself to perfectly understand any 
one thing, and had really apineciated what constitutes knowledge, he 
would know that in the infinity of other conclusions he does not under- 
stand one."^ 

We ought, wiien experimenting, to always have these words in mind; 
for if it Is true that we ought to keep our attention firmly fixed upon a 
fact until we have ac(iuired a clear and limpid i»erception of it, it is 
none the less so that before interi)reting it we ought to consider its 
entire surroundings, remembering that it is not isolated, but, on the con- 
trary, a simple facet, infinitely small, of a preeminently complex whole. 
Let us not imitate the presum])tuous physiologists that achieve success 
by the apparent clearness of their explanations, giving the ])upil the 
agreeable illusion that he can learn much, quickly, and without fatigue. 
This, unfortunately, is a too general tendency, and we often see how, in 
their desire to warp the phenomena of life to the limits of their own

iiitelligeuce, tliey construct systems much more ingeuious than vera- 
cious, and then display them before a public that only applauds readily 
constructed automata presented to it as living beings. I must confess 
that I always look with extreme distrust upon systems. I can not for- 
get that if they have a didactic importance they never correspond 
exactly to the truth, especially in what concerns living beings, so (M^m- 
plex in their great simplicity. Technical necessities often oblige us to 
separate functional elements from each other; but we then ought to 
seek to reunite them, because it is from their union that springs that 
resultant complex of reciprocal influences that constitutes a living- 
organism. Thus to the cool, impartial, aiul sagacious work of the 
experimenter the physiologist must bring the assistance of a high 
])hilosophical culture and a certain breadth of intuition and imagina- 
tion, that faculty which Tyndall ' lauds as one of the most powerful 
aids to hunum i^rogress. "Without imagination," says he, "we could 
not make a step beyond the animal world; we could hardly reach its 
confines. I do not here allude to that irregular power that plays 
capriciously with facts, l)ut to that orderly, disciphned capacity whose 
only function is to create the ideas imperiously demanded by the 
intellect." 

Certainly, looked at in this way, the goal of physiology is very diffi- 
cult to reach, and I should be the last to remind you of it, being myself 
unequal to the task. But inability to attain an ideal ought not to pre- 
vent you from having it constantly before your eyes, from clinging to 
and proclaiming it, in hopes that others with greater iiowers than your- 
self may reach it. High ambitions are allowed to all, provided that 
they are sincere and disinterested, and I do not think that doubt can 
be entertained of the sincerity of a lover of physiology, particularly in 
this age of sharp struggle for material existence.

THE WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATIOX AT PAEIS.^ 



By E. J. Marey, 

Member of the Institute of France. 



Pliysiology has for its domain all organized natnre. It seeks to pene- 
trate the secret of life in all beings. It is the guide of natural history, 
which ought not only to describe tlie forms of animals and of plants, 
but also to ascertain the kind of life and the functions peculiar to each 
species. 

The older naturalists understood that their science liad this scope; 
the zoologists, for example, when they described the species of anim;ils, 
noted at the same time the habitat, method of locomotion, kind of food, 
and manner of reproduction of each. 

This way of studying and teaching the natural sciences was kei)t up 
so long as people w^ere content to observe the exterior of aniiiials and 
the external manifestations of their life; but, in proportion as the 
anatomy of living l)eings was more profoundly studied, the naturalist's 
task became harder; for a knowledge of the conformation of the differ- 
ent organs awakened a desire to understand the functions of each. 
From this moment a division of labor became necessary. Those who 
applied themselves more especially to the anatomical description of 
organized beings were called naturalists and those who specially 
studied the functions of life physiologists. 

If such a separation were permanent, if the two parallel sciences 
were not united at certain points, both would suffer. Zoology Avould 
then be only a dry catalogue of animal forms w^hose meaning- would be 
unexphiined, while physiology, confined to laboratories and reduced to 
experimentation upon mutilated animals, would teach us less how^ these 
animals live than how to make them die. 

Is it not possible to combine these natural sciences without hindering 
the development necessary for each? I wish to show you that this can 
sometimes be done and that it affords us the highest intellectual satis- 
faction, that of comprehending the marvelous harmonies of living

nature. In order to unite zoology aud physiology it is necessary that 
tliese two sciences should have methods in common and should apply 
them under the same circumstances, Avhich should neither be in the 
gallery of the zoologist nor in the laboratory of the Aavisector. 

During our epoch the natural sciences have made such progress as has 
quite transformed them. The physiologists of to-day use new methods 
and instruments of precjision which enable them to study the phenomena 
of life with an exactitude formerly obtained only by physicists. This 
apparatus, first intended to be used in vivisection, is undergoing a grad- 
ual change and is tending to become applicable for use upon animals 
and to man himself while in perfect health and in the exercise of their 
Hornuil functions. 

On their side the zoologists, in addition to the menageries in which 
they bring together living animals of all kinds and all countries, have 
found, in the employment of the aquarium and in the establishment of 
maritime zoological stations, the means of observing in its natural 
surroundings tlie fauna of the sea and even that of fresh water. The 
moment seems to have arrived when the natural sciences may be made 
to profit by these two kinds of progress, and -when we may direct 
toward a common end efforts too long divergent. 

It is with this intention that the Physiological Station was estab- 
lished. 

In order to show the resources of this institution and the develop- 
ments it ought to have, permit me to first recount the evolution of the 
Schemes of investigation for the application of Avhich it a\ as established. 



Daughter of anatomy, physiology was at first obliged to use the 
scalpel. It was "while dissecting living animals that Asellius, Harvey, 
Charles Bell, and so many others made their grand discoveries. But 
the number of phenomena accessible to pure observation is necessa- 
rily limited, so physiologists had to borrow from the ])liysicists their 
methods and their instruments in order to discover new facts. Thus 
the mercurial manometer was used by JNIagendie to measure the pressure 
of the blood at the different ])oints of the vascular system: the deli- 
cate thermometers of Walferdin enabled Claude Berinird to show the 
unequal distribution of temperature in the orgaiiism, to recognize the 
effect which nerves have upon these variations of temperature, and to 
establish the foundations of a general theory of vasomotor nerves. 
M. Pasteur himself, whose discoveries have given a new impetus to 
j)hysiology and medicine, would never have been able to support his 
doctrines by such weight of evidence had he not conceived and created 
new methods and appliances. 

For many long years I have devoted my time to developing and i>er- 
fecting physiological a])paratus. Struck with the importance of move- 
ment in most of the functions of life, I wished to make it possible to

register and measure this fugitive pheuomenoii, and for tbat puri)oseI 
liad recourse to the tracing apparatus wliich occupies to-day an impor- 
tant place in our laboratories. Thus M. Frau^ois-Franck, who continues 
with so much talent my teaching at the College of France, makes much 
use of the graphic method. Those of you who follow his work have 
often seen him examine at the same time upon the same animal, seven 
or eight different vital movements, registering them by tracings placed 
one above the other so as to make apparent the reciprocal relations of 
all the phenomena that occur during the course of an experiment. 

Fig. 1, PI. XLVI, taken from the beautiful memoir of M. Franck upon 
the action of digitalin, is an exam])leof thesemultiple registrations. The 
five tracings shown ui)on this plate are, from above downward, as fol- 
lows: First, that of a mercurial manometer indicating the pressure of 
the blood in the carotid artery; second, that of another manometer 
showing the variation of pressure in the pulmonary artery; third, tbat 
of a sphygmoscope giving the pulsations of the pulmonary arteryj 
fourth, that of another giving the carotid pulse; fifth, the lower line, 
giving, in seconds, the time occupied by the experiment. Eeference lines 
traced upon this sheet show the effects produced at the same moment 
in the four tracings by a stimulus that causes a tetanus of the heart. 
A simi>le inspection of this figure teaches us all the variations that 
tetanus of the heart produces in the general and in the imlmonarj'' 
circulation with a precision that the most attentive observation could 
not attain. 

In a special vrork' I have described most of the tracing instruments, 
paying special attention to those which do not re(|uire preliminary 
vivisections, but record the action of organs by their exterior manifes- 
tations. We can thus, in both man and other animals, record the pul- 
sations of the heart and arteries, the respiratory movements of the 
thorax and of the abdomen, the phases in the displacement of respired 
air, the contractions of the muscles, with the various degrees of force 
which they develop, the variations of caliber occurring in small vessels, 
etc. jModeru physiologists pay particular attention to perfecting and 
multiplying these apparatus already so widely applied and of a much 
greater range of application than ha<l at first appeared possible. 

In fact this apparatus not only records the phenomena for which it 
was directly invented, but permits us to ascertain indirectly other fiicts. 
Thus the myograph, invented at first for recording the movement 
of muscles, makes known indirectly the velocity of the transmission of 
force in the motor and sensitive nerves, in the columns of the spinal 
cord, and even in the different layers of the cortex of the brain. 

For the nervous acts of organic life, such as the contraction and 
relaxation of vessels, of which we do not even have any conscious 
knowledge, physiologists also possess a veritable myograph in the 
graphic apparatus that records the changes of volume of organs. 



'La M6tliode grapliiqiie: Paris, G. Masson, 1885. 



394 WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS. 

Many improvements have been made in tliis apparatns during recent 
years. Quite recently two pupils of M. Frau^ois-Franck, MM. Halliou 
and Comte, liave conceived a small instrument very simple and easy 
of application. On introducing a. linger between two air cushions con- 
nected with a grai)hic apparatus it is seen that this finger constantly 
changes its volume, swells when its vessels dilate and diminishes as 
they contract. Any pain felt by the subject under experiment, a simple 
sensation of heat or cold, anj^ emotion, even if slight, is soon followed 
by notable contraction of the vessels of the finger; that is to say, by a 
lowering of the curve that is traced. (See fig. 2, PL XLVI.) 

We even find that in certain maladies an excitation not perceived by 
the subject may give rise to a vascular contraction, which shows that 
the seat of production of the vascular reflex is different from that of 
conscious sensation. 

The possibility of transmitting to considerable distances by means of 
air tubes the movements it is desired to record has mucli enlarged the 
field of ajiplication of the graphic method. 

Thus we may in the case of a running man or a galloping horse note 
the succession of footfalls or the cadence of the hoofs. In a flying bird 
we may record the various phases of the action of its muscles, the trajec- 
tory of a point of its wing, and tlie reactions thus effected upon the mass 
of its body. But these experiments, although very carefully made, give 
but a partial knowledge of the complicated acts of animal locomotion. 
Another method, more prompt and more simple, records these move- 
ments in a much more perfect manner. This is chrono-photography. 

I had the honor two years ago to make known to you the origin and 
developments of this method. Since then I have improved it and 
apidied it to the study of the most varied i)henomena. All these appli- 
cations have been set forth in a little volume recently published.^ It 
will be sufticient to say that besides the phenomena of physics and 
mechanics, in which chrono-photography does most valuable service, 
this method enables us to analyze the kind of locomotion used by most 
species of animals, mammals, reptiles, birds, insects, fishes, etc. It may 
even be used to register the movement of microscopic creatures. 

Chrono photography may therefore be considered as the most perfect 
form of the graphic method. It is especially important when we have 
to deal with very extensive or complicated movements, or, indeed? 
when a movement has not sufiicient force to actuate the tracer of an 
instrument. 

A record of the mechanical forces developed by animals may be 
obtained by other apparatus, such as dynamographs, some of which 
measure efforts of traction, others efibrts of pressure, and tliese, by the 
way, must, like balances, be more or less strongly constructed according 
to the amount of force to be applied. 

In order to give a complete idea of the physiological apparatus we 
should also cite the instruments used to measure the eleetric currents

by which nerves aiul muscles tire stimuhited, or to determine the char- 
acteristics of the electricity generated by animals. The numerous 
improvements introduced by M. d' Arson val iu the determination of tem- 
peratures and the measurement of the calories generated by an ani- 
mal according to its height, species, and the ])hysiological conditions 
in wliich it is placed, should be here mentioned. 

All these apparatus also tend to become registers, and this makes 
their indications comparable with each other and i)eimits us to assemble 
in a single graphic table the curves of all sorts of phenomena. All 
tend likewise to be applicable to man and to animals under normal con- 
ditions without disturbing in any Avay the functions they are intended 
to investigate. 

The zoologist, then, as well as the experimental physiologist, may 
investigate in different species of ariimals the variation of function in 
an organ corresponding to its A'ariation of form. It is here, as 1 have 
before said, that union may be effected between the two sciences, long 
separated from each other. 

II. 

Physiologists and naturalists ought to seek not only unity of method, 
but also a favorable held for their joint investigations. The classical 
physiological laboratory is not well adapted to anything but vivisec- 
tions, while space, open air, and unobstructed light are indispensable 
for the study of living creatnres. It often happens that it is difiticult 
to secure all the conditions necessary; it is hardly possible to study 
the physiology of insects except in the country; marine animals must 
be studied at some maritime station with all the necessary instruments. 

It is, however, possible to set up near cities an experimental station 
fulfilling thei)rinc!i)al conditions just noted. The Physiological Station 
is the first establishment of this kind; it already afltords many resources 
not elsewhere found; and is, besides, susceptible of important devel- 
opments that may be made from time to time as the need for them is 
felt. But in bringing this establishment to its present state many diffi- 
culties were encountered which it nmy be useful to briefly consider. 

In 18GI, at the time when the graphic method of recording certain 
physiological phenomena seemed sufficiently developed to permit an 
analysis of the different kinds of movements, I attempted to use it for 
determining the mechanism of locomotion in different species of ani- 
mals. The movement of the wings of insects was quite easy to catch, 
and besides, the theory of this kind of locomotion had been established 
by a true synthesis, using artificial api)aratus, in which a motion of 
translation was effected by agitating mechanical wings. This first suc- 
cess made me think that the problem of the flight of birds, the details of 
which almost completely elude direct observation, might be elucidated 
by the same method, and that tame birds to which suitable apparatus 
had been fitted would, when flying in an inclosed space, record the move-

ments of their own wings, together with the reactions which such 
movements produced upon their own bodies. 

An artist's studio, No. 14 rue de I'Ancienne Comedie, furnished me 
the large room necessary for my purpose. This studio, 15 meters long 
by V2 wide and S high, was well lighted. It was easy to set up within 
it the workbench of a mechanic, cages for animals, and glass cases 
for the instruments, already so numerous, required for physiological 
researches. In this way, an old theater which had accommodated the 
ConnMlio Fran^aise in its early days, and was afterwards the studio in 
which Horace Vernet painted his great heroic pictures, became in turn 
a shelter for science, and was the first laboratory established bypriv^ate 
enterprise for physiological experimentation. 

Many advantages were already combined in this first establishment. 
They were certainly superior to those which I found later at the College 
of Fiance when I entered it as professor. Much time is saved if the 
construction of the instruments, together with the incessant niodifica- 
tions of them re(iuired by this kind of experimentation, can be super- 
vised in the same apartment in which the experiments themselves are 
conducted. 

With carefully tamed buzzards, with ]>igeons, and with ducks, I 
succeeded in registering the moA'ements of tlight, the frequency and 
character of the wing strokes, the contraction of the muscles, and tlie 
reactions produced upon the body of the bird. 

This study conducted me to that of the resistance of the air, which 
made it necessary to construct a whirling table meters in diameter, in 
order to determine the pressure of air on different surfaces for dittereut 
velocities of rotation. 

This apparatus, also supplied with special registers, gives us an 
op])ortunity of analyzing the movements of walking in man, and was 
used in the beautiful experiments of my pupil and lamented friend, 
(t. Carlet. 

As might have been expected, the space was soon found insufficient 
for studying the locomotion of man. On a circular path 20 meters at 
most in diameter it was impossible to walk otherwise than slowly, 
incessantly ham]>ered by the curve of the circle. Open roads were 
necessary for the study of walking ami running, and horizontal or vari- 
ousl}' inclined footways were required for the determination, bj^ means 
of the portable odograph, of the influences that cause variations in the 
cadence and length of steps. I often had to go far in order to find all 
the necessary conditions. 

Later, attempting to determine the best means of utilizing the mus- 
cular force of man and animals, I had to compare the amount of work 
expended in the traction of carriages, both with rigid and slightly elas- 
tic traces, and upon different kinds of ground. In the neighborhood of 
the grounds of the Luxembourg there were certain avenues paved in 
different ways. I here experimented with carriages drawn at ditterent

velocities, following them and carrying the registering apparatus, sur- 
rounded by an importunate cro\Ad of curious peojde. 

At another time, wishing to ascertain the effect which gymnastic train- 
ing has upon the movements of the heart and on respiration, I had to 
transport my apparatus to the ficole de Joinville, to which M. Hillairet 
kindly offered me access. 

Finally, in order to determine the succession of the movements of the 
horse, I had to go to the riding schools of Paris to find the means of 
making the necessary experiments. 

The annoyance of shifting about so continually was but slight as com- 
pared with the grave disadvantages of carrying long distances delicate 
instruments whose slightest derangement made the journey useless. 
From that time I had but one desire, that of finding a spacious ground 
where I might unite a workshop, a laboratory, and an experimental field. 
I soon thought that my wishes were about to be realized. 

In 1S78, the Universal Exposition had just been closed, and General 
Farre, then minister of war, who was interested in my experiments on 
the gaits of men and horses, offered to i^lace at my disposal some ground 
in the Champ de Mars which was in a few months to be turned over to 
the war department. This was the large space where now stands the 
Eiffel Tower. An officer of engineers examined the place and at the 
end of a few weeks sent me a plan showing a perfectly level circular 
track 500 meters in circumference, iiassing through the groups of trees 
there planted, and touching the edges of the two lakes. At certain 
times of the day this track was to be given up to experiments. I yet 
have this plan Avhich gave me a certain transitory joy. In a few weeks 
it happened that by a certain arrangement between the General Gov- 
ernment and the city the grounds were assigned to the latter and I 
thought for a time that all was lost. 

But the municii)al council of Paris, which has given so many proofs 
of its interest in science, was soon to gratify my wishes beyond my 
hopes. 

Upon the motion of its president, M. de Heredia, the municipal coun- 
cil placed at my disposition a spacious ground at the Pare des Princes, 
and voted an aniuial allowance of 12,000 francs to maintain the new 
establishment. The General Government on its part, upon the request 
of M. Jules Ferry, granted the sum necessary for the construction of the 
buildings. Finally, to add to these resources, I transferred to the new 
locality the laboratory for advanced studies which I had been conduct- 
ing at the College of France, us well as all the apparatus and instru- 
ments that I had made during more than twenty years. 

Such was the origin of the Physiological Station, which is already 
known to many of you. Those who may do me the honor to visit it 
will not find there monumental constrnctions, but slight buildings 
which during the summer season admit of the employment of a con- 
siderable number of workers and are arranged for all sorts of studies. 



398 WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS. 

I have there been able to lesunie, under new and quite exact condi- 
tions, my studies of the flight of birds, experimenting upon a great 
number of different species. By means of chrono-photography it has 
been possible to obtain a series of the successive phases of a wing 
stroke in tlie form of instantaneous photographs, as many as one hun- 
dred per second being recently obtained. Thus, in a wing stroke so 
rapid that the eye can not follow it, the apparatus shows with perfect 
precision more than twenty successive ])hases, passing from one to 
another by almost insensible transitions. 

The gaits of the horse have been determined, not only as regards 
the su(;cessive beats of the feet, but in a complete manner; that is to 
say, by fixing the entire series of actions and reactions that are involved. 

The great circular and perfectly level track permits us to analyze the 
walking and running paces of man as well as his various physical exer- 
cises, and to determine the conditions most favorable to the proper 
utilization of muscular force. These studies have been conducted with 
regard to their practical application, either for the amelioration of the 
condition of the soldier or for the imi)rovement of the methods of i)hys- 
ical education. In these researches I have been greatly aided by the 
officers of the army and by my former assistant, M. Demeny, who, up 
to recent years, performed his duties with much skill. 

I would not speak of the ex[)eriments made at the Physiological Sta- 
tion on a great many x)hysical and mechanical phenomena, such as the 
fall of bodies, the resistance of the air, the vibrations of strings, the 
movement of li([uids, the measurement of forces and of work, etc., 
were it not that tliese studies are intimately connected with the physi- 
ology of movement. 

In fact, in the locomotion of man and of terrestrial animals the me- 
chanical actions of the muscles consist in displacing the center of grav- 
ity of the body, either by lifting its weight or by imparting to it a 
movement of translation. From these actions in various directions we 
can deduce the amount of work expended. In aerial locomotion the 
action of the muscles communicates a similar amount of movement, 
both to the body of the animal and to the mass of air struck by the 
wings. The same division occurs in different kinds of locomotion upon 
the ground and in the water. 

The experiments already made at the Physiological Station have 
given the a])proxinuite value of the work exj^ended in the different 
kinds of locomotion. These determinations have been checked by two 
different methods; on the one hand, by measuring the forces and the 
«|uantities of mavement by means of registering dynamometers; on the 
other, by estinniting the forces acting at each moment by the accelera- 
tion imparted to the mass of the body.' The results derived from these 
two sources show variations of but slight importance, that will cer- 
tainly disappear when the methods of analyzing movements and forces 
shall be perfected.

At any rate these experimeuts liave clearly sbowu that muscular 
forces behave in their final result like other mechanical forces. 
New problems are uow placed before us; let us examine them. 

III. 

The analysis of the movements of man and animals may be made 
from different points of view. It is, indeed, not sufficient to determine 
the external characters of the movement; the important matter is to 
ascertain the mechanism by which that movement is effected and to 
distinguish the part played by the different portions of the locomotor 
apparatus, muscles, articular surfaces, and osseous radii. 

To adapt it for these different researches chronophotography inay be 
employed in different ways,' sometimes using a movable plate and some- 
times a fixed plate. 

When it is wished to record the movements as a whole, it is necessary 
to use cbrono-photography on a movable plate, for it gives a series of 
entire images of the subject in action. Thus PI. XLVII, which shows 
seven different attitudes of a person taking a step in walking, gives the 
necessary information concerning the velocity and the extent of the 
displacements of the body and the limbs as well as the state of con- 
traction or relaxation of certain muscles shown in relief under the skin. 
But in order to be well understood tliese independent images should be 
placed in their relative positions, and this is done by means of a series 
of successive tracings, examples of which will shortly be given. 

This laborious and delicate operation makes the analysis of move- 
ment a long process: this may, however, be shortened in certain cases. 
It was just because I wished to get, at a single exposure, a photo- 
graphic outline of a movement that I conceived the idea of chrono- 
photography upon a fixed plate. AVitli this method it is true the 
images of a moving man or an animal are reduced to a few brilliant 
points and lines, but this is generally sufficient to mark the action of 
the limbs in the different gaits. 

It is not only in locomotion properly so called that movements occur 
that are of scientific interest; mastication, respiration, speecli, expres- 
sion of the countenance, partial movements of the limbs, hands, or feet 
are of no less interest. 

Suppose, for example, that it is desired to ascertain the movements 
of the lower jaw by chrono-photography on a fixed plate. 

The teeth of the lower jaw, first well wiped, are idaced in one of 
those metallic molds fall of wax, which dentists use for taking impres- 
sions. Upon this solid base there is fixed a bright metallic rod (fig. 1, 
PI. XL VIII), whose angular curvature exactly follows that of the lower 
jaw. This rod, placed outside of the jaw, shows clearly upon a small 
piece of velvet that forms for it a dark background (fig. 2, PI. XLVfll). 

1 See Le Mouvemeut, Chapters IV and VII. 



400 WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS. 

If a series of successive photographs is taken upon a fixed jdate 
during the act of opeiiiug or closing the mouth, the figure thus 
obtained gives all the positions successively occupied by the bright 
rod, and consequently all the displacements of the lower jaw itself. 
Kow it will be seen tiiat, by reason of the sliding of the condyles of the 
jaw in the glenoid cavities, the center of movement is found very low 
upon the ascending ramus near the angle (fig. 3, PI. XLVIII). 

In movements of mastication this line takes different positions 
according as we chew upon the incisor or upon the molar teeth. It has 
still other movements during speech or in displacement of the chin 
either forward or backward (tig. 4, PI. XLVIII). 

In these experiments chrono-photography gives us a true sketch of 
the movements, and as the length of the bright rod is exactly equal to 
that of the lower jaw its end traces out exactly the form of that i)art 
of the glenoid surface upon which the condyle slides. This experiment 
already shows us the necessary interdependence between the forms ot 
organs and the forms of movements. It would be curious to follow out 
in a series of animal species this anatomo-physiological parallel. 

It should be noted that these experiments were made under very 
simi)le conditions and that it was not necessary to use the chrono- 
photograi>hic apparatus. 

In this case it was of but little importance to find the velocity and 
phases of movement of the lower jaw; it Avas only desired to determine 
the successive positions of the jaw at the difterent degrees of opening 
the mouth, a perfect equality in the intervals of time separating the 
different images being unnecessary. Besides, these experiments were 
made in winter, with a diffused and quite feeble light, a long exposure 
(about one-fourth of a second) being necessary. The ])rocedure was 
as follows: 

An ordinary photographic apparatus provided with a pneumatic shut- 
ter Avas trained ui>on the subject of exi)eriment. Tliis subject having 
his head tirndy supported from behind so as to fix it, opened his mouth 
at several successive degrees of wideness, stopping an instant after 
each, so that a photograph might be taken. The figure thus obtained 
differs in no respect from that which thechrono-photographic apparatus 
might have given, except that the intervals separating two successive 
images are arbitrary. 

When it is wished to determine the trajectory of a point, an ordinary 
photographic; ajiparatus is also sufficient. In this case the shutter is 
held open during the entire movement, and if the i)oint is brilliant and 
shown upon a dark background it traces its trajectory in the form of a 
continuous line. It is in this manner that I was able to determine the 
character of the movement of the atlas upon the axis, according to the 
trajectory made by a brilliant point fixed upon the occiput. 

The movements of the ribs during respiration are determined in a 
similar nnmuer. These movenu'uts are very complex because of the

curvature of the ribs, the unequal tlexibility of their cartilages, and 
their multiple articulations both with the bodies and transverse proc- 
esses of the vertebrte aud with the sternum and costal cartilages. 
Without points of reference observation of the movements of the ribs 
was absolutely impossible; the nature of these displacements has there- 
fore been heretofore determined according to certain theoretical con- 
siderations. Experimentation gives, on the contrary, very exact results. 

A series of small, black rods (fig. 1, plate XLIX) presses loosely upon 
the walls of the chest, each resting upon a rib by one of its extremities 
and bearing near this point a very brilliant pearl. An ordinary photo- 
graphic apparatus is turned toward the subject of experiment, who, 
strongly illuminated, is placed before a black background. If the 
exposure lasts during the entire respiratory movement we obtain fig. 1, 
in which each of the brilliant pearls has traced the movement of the 
subjacent rib. At the first glance it is seen that each rib has its own 
special movement. 

This is not the place to analyze the mechanism of this movement. I 
may say, however, that among the divers opinions which have been 
held by authors that of Chabry accords the best with the results of the 
experiments. 

If it is required to know the nature of the movement of the anterior 
wall of the chest, we apply upon that wall the series of rods and obtain 
the trajectory of each of the points of that wall from the epigastrium to 
the superior part of the sternum. We then see that the epigastrium 
has but a slight upward movement, while the sternum moves obliquely 
upward and forward. 

Similar researches repeated upon dilierent species of animals would 
doubtless give interesting results as to the comparative i^hysiology of 
respiration considered from a mechanical point of view. 

Another very important study is that of respiratory types. It has 
been supposed that women breathe especially by means of the upper 
part of the thorax (superior costal type), and men by the diaphragm 
(abdominal type). Hutchinsou has shown these two types by tracing 
on a wall the silhouette of a man and that of a woman in the two 
extreme states of inspiration and expiration. But the hand has not 
time to trace the profile of the thorax and of the abdomen during the 
few instants in which inspiration reaches its extreme limits 5 besides, if 
the subject stops his respiratory movements a moment, nothing x)roves 
that the thorax and the abdomen keep the res^iective positions which 
they had in normal resj^iration. 

Photography replaces with advantage the tracing of the silhouettes. 
An ordinary apparatus provided with a pneumatic shutter is trained 
upon the subject. A picture is taken during inspiration, another dur- 
ing expiration, and we thus obtain a double contour for all parts of the 
trunk displaced. W^e thus show that in a woman without a corset 
respiration occurs as it does iu a man — that is to say, that the thorax 
aud tlie abdomen both take piart in it.

402 WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS. 

Not only does cbrono-pliotogTaphy afford a means of studying the 
kinematics of movements, it also funiisbes an indication of the work 
performed in certain muscular acts. 

A distinguished engineer, M. Fremont, has just made at the physio- 
logical station a study of the Avork performed in hammering iron upon 
an anvil. On a movable film M. Fremont took the .series of attitudes 
assumed by the blacksmith in the successive movements given to the 
hammer.' By chronophotography on a fixed plate there Avas shown 
tbe trajectory of the hammer and its successive positions at definite 
instants, the intervals between which weremeasured bj- a chronographic 
dial. 

By such a figure we can estimate the forces acting upon the mass of 
the hammer at each instant by means of the acceleration given to that 
mass. AVe also obtain a measure of the work, since it shows tlie 
velocity of the hammer at tbe moment it is about to strike the iron. 

In most physiological acts forces and work should be measured by 
another method — that is to say, by the dynamograpb. I have described 
under the name of dynamographs certain instruments that show the 
forces of i^ressure or traction applied to them by me.ms of a stylus that 
traces tbe curve of variations of these forces.- I bave also shown bow 
the results obtained from these instruments may be synchronized with 
those obtained from chrono-pbotography, so that we may know at each 
libase of a footfall, for example, what force tbe foot exerts upon tbe soil 
in a vertical direction. If a traction dynamograpb indicates the force 
developed by the same act, we may by combining these different data 
obtain all tbe information necessary to understand tbe mechanism of 
locomotion in different animals. 

The number of experiments necessary may seem to you excessive, 
but tbe invention of methods, tbe care required to secure their preci- 
sion, their first application to the analysis of movements and to the 
measure of forces constituted the most arduous part of the task. 
Already our records accumulate; the field of jiossible comparisons 
enlarges every day, and at the same time tbe interest in anatomo- 
physiological comparisons increases. I wish to give you some examples 
of these comparisons. 

IV. 

If we wish to study locomotion in different types of mammals so as 
to elucidate the variety of their forms by tbe special movements char- 
acteristic of each we must first ascertain all the anatomical and physi- 
ological elements necessary for such a comparison. 

Drawings and plates will not suffice as anatomical material. It is 
necessary to use natural organs, skeletons, articulations, preparations, 
or casts of muscles. Now, thanks to the ready assistance of various 

' These studies will shortly l>e published by M. Fri5iuont.

WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS. 403 

anatomists, I have been able to collect a portion of tbe specimens nec- 
essary for the stndy of certain common species of mammals. 

I have also been able to collect, in the physiological department, 
chrc no-photographs and sketches of the movement of the same species. 

Plates L and LI show a series of thirty-six photographs of a dog; 
taken while making a step. For such a slow gait the mimber of pictures 
is greater than necessary, for a more rapid one all would be required. In 
the present case it will be sufiicicnt to compare every four pictures to 
follow the phases of the movement. As the chronometric dial is used to 
measure the intervals of time between two successive attitudes, so 
the space passed over by the animal is measured by a mark fixed in the 
ground. This mark consists of a small white rod set up on the course. 
At the commencement of the experiment the dog is behind the rod, at 
the end he has passed it. The actual distance traversed is read oft" 
upon a metric scale. 

Plate LII shows a sheep walking. The number of photographs is 
reduced to nine, and the time between the tirst and last, as shown by 
the chronometric dial, is twenty -five sixtieths of a second. The pro- 
gression of the animal is estimated by his approach to the chronometer. 

To obtain these pictures a dark background is used. This is not nec- 
essary when a movable film is employed; then a light background will 
answer, as shown in ])late LIII, which represents a galloping horse. As 
this was quite a long series, it was not possible within the space of a 
column of text to show the entire set of movements; about half are 
shown from the moment when the horse leaves the ground to that 
when the two diagonally opposite feet are on the ground. 

It is sometimes desirable to take pictures of an animal from different 
aspects; chrono photography upon a movable plate is easily adapted 
to such work. It is possible to follow in any gait of an animal the 
series of movements of his limbs. 

But the dimensions of the pictures obtained by printing from the 
original negatives are too small to be directly utilized. Arrangements 
must be made to more easily examine and measure the displacements 
made by the different portions of the same limb during the step of any 
gait. For this we proceed as follows: 

We commence by enlarging- by means of a projection apparatus each 
of the little images which we wish to compare. Plate LI V shows one of 
these enlargements. It is limited to five diameters, so as to accommo- 
date the page, but it is better to nearly double those dimensions. 

If we wish, for example, to study the movement of one of the hind 
legs we trace the contours of that leg on a sheet of transparent ])aper, 
using as guides in applying this paper to the picture the line of the 
ground and a fixed point upon that line. Having- traced the first 
image of the series we proceed to the second, placing the transparent 
paper exactly over the guides, and thus obtain (fig.l ) the series of suc- 
cessive positions occupied by the hind leg of a horse while walking, 
from the first raising of the foot to its final return to the ground.

cefssive planes superi»osed upon each other, so that the last image

attempt has been made to represent by dotted lines the contours of the

two legs. 

At the first glance it is seen that in different species of animals the 
length of the step in relation to the height is very different. This ine- 
quality is much greater in rapid gaits aud in certain animals of small 
stature.

But I can not enter into detail regarding these special comparative 
studies which show analogies and differences between various species 
of animals in accordauce with their anatomical structure. 

The absolute fidelity of these chrono-photographic outlines allows us 
to estimate the value of certain analyses of the movements of limbs 
made by different authors. The most exact are certainly those of Vin- 
cent and Goiftbn, We can not too greatly admire the sagacity of these 
authors who have given so faithful a representation of the movements 
of tlie horse in slow gaits. 

Finally, these same pictures permit us to determine the action of cer- 
tain muscles at different phases of the gaits. By starting from the suc- 
cessive attitudes of the limbs we reach the physiological mechanism of 
the movements under consideration.

. The sagacity of physiologists has often been tried by these obscure 
questions. Maissiat ' more than anyone else has attempted to eluci- 
date the part played by muscles in the walk of man. He has done in 
this respect all that can be done by subtle observation joined to a pro- 
found knowledge of the laws of mechanics. 

But in questions of this kind the keenest intelligence can not attain 
the precise results that are obtained by an exact method. Already, by 
using localized electrization, Duchenne, of Boulogne, has shown in 
man the special functions of the individual muscles; he has shown that 
in the various acts of locomotion the uuiscles are associated by groups, 
synergistic or antagonistic, and that each movement is a resultant of 
these combined forces. 

More powerful methods allow us to now elucidate these questions. 

Upon the photographs of an animal in motion we may mark the 
origin and insertion of muscles which we have learned from our ana- 
tomical specimens, and, joining these insertions by one or more marks,

we will liave for each attitude of a limb the length shown by each mus- 
cle visible in the hgure under consideration. We can easily follow 
upon the series of photographs the phases of the shortening or length- 
eniug of these muscles — that is to say, their contraction or their relaxa- 
tion. We may finally trace the curve or change of length of these 
ditterent muscles according to time, and compare the relations which 
exist between certain muscular acts and the reactions imparted to the 
body of the animal. 

As soon as we know the action of the different muscles during the 
different phases of movement of an animal, we shall have the greater 
part of the data necessary for understanding the mechanism of loco- 
motion. Now, this knowledge can not be acquired by simple observa- 
tion, for the most sustained attention concentrated on the action of a 
single nmscle, can with difticulty catch the phases of activity and of 
repose even for the slowest gait. How, then, can we hope to catch the 
action of all the muscles of the limbs at all phases of a raj)id gait"? 

Such is the general plan for the study of comparative locomotion 
which I have Just undertaken. This long task is as yet but little 
advanced, but the results which it promises are worth all the efforts 
which it will cost. 

V. 

Certain minds value science only for its practical application. To 
such we may recall what the Physiological Station has already done and 
show what it may be expected to do. The physician may seek there 
new means for the diagnosis of certain maladies and for investigating 
the effects of their treatment; the soldier may study there the proper 
regulation of marching- so as to diminish fatigue and use to greater 
advantage the bodily forces; the educator of youth may learn how to 
logically direct gymnastic exercises; the artist, how to represent more 
truthfully the scenes that he wishes to depict; the agriculturist, how 
to use to the best advantage the strength of animals; the artisan, 
how to more quickly acquire the skill necessary for his professional 
labors. It seems that the utilitarian side of ])hysiology has up to the 
present time been the best appreciated. 

But science has also other functions; it gives a lofty satisfaction to 
the mind by causing us to comprehend the marvelous harmonies of 
nature. The astronomer who knows how to calculate the movement 
of the stars, to measure their distance, estimate their masses, and even 
determine their chemical composition, must have a more lively intellect- 
ual pleasure than the ordinary contemplator of the stariy vault. There 
is no doubt that zoology and physiology, mutually elucidating each 
other, give us a grander conception of the animal kingdom by showing 
its action in all its beauty. 

I imagine that this evolution of the natural sciences will be effected, 
as may be said, of itself, by the patient and methodical collection of 



WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS. 407 

anatomical facts aud experimental determinations. And since we are 
considering here only the comparative physiology of animal locomotion, 
1 believe that it is easy to point out the successive stages which ought 
to lead to this result. 

First, the animal forms should be grouped according to the type 
of motion pecuhar to them, so as to bring into notice their general 
anatomico-physiological relations. This we have now begun to do, and 
it IS already evident that many of these relations depend upon ordinary 
laws of mechanics. These rehite to muscles, bones, and articular sur- 
faces. As regards this I can only summarize here what I have given 
elsewhere with more detail.' 

The relation existing between the form and the functions of muscles 
is as follows: The extent of the movement of a muscle is in proportion 
to the length of its red fibers; its force is proportional to the cross- 
section of such fibers; the work it can i^erform is proportional to its 
weight. 

These relations, the first of which was established by Borelli, can 
easily be verified upon the muscles of a single animal. They explain 
also why, in two different species, homologous muscles have diiferent 
anatomical characters; it is because the functions of the muscles difier 
in tlie two si^ecies. 

It will be seen that in order to carry further the anatomico-physiolog- 
ical relation it will be necessary to determine with great precision the 
functions of each muscle and the peculiarities of its movements; it is 
precisely for that purpose that the experiments have been undertaken 
which I have cited above. 

The form and length of the bones correspond to that of the muscles 
attached to them, and to which they seem subordinated, as is shown 
by the beautiful expo'iments of Fick ; the configuration of the articu- 
lations shows the character of the movements which they permit. 

Let us consider, for example, the form of the head of the humerus in 
different animals. We see that it has a spherical curvature in man, 
monkeys, and lemurs, in which animals movements in every direction 
are allowed; that it is cylindrical in ruminants and pachyderms whose 
anterior limbs move backward and forward, parallel to the axis of the 
body; elliptical in birds whose wings move with unequal amplitude in 
two directions perpendicular to each other. It is impossible not to see 
that there is, between the form of the articular surfaces and the move- 
ments, a necessary relation which permits us, when we know the char- 
acteristics of the movement, to predict what will be those of the organ, 
and vice versa. 

A long habit of comparing with each other the skeletons of different 
animals enabled Ouvier to recognize among the difterent bones of an 
animal certain relationships which he called the' subordination of 
characters. A bone of a certain form implied the existence of certain

characteristics in tlie other pieces of the slicleton. Our .urcat natural- 
ist could therefore, to repeat au expression that has become classical, 
restore from a sinjile bone the entire skeleton of the animal to which 
that bone belon,i;cd. 

Without the long- practice of a Cuvier, we may, by taking for our 
guide aiiaitomico-physiological relations, arrive at determinations of a 
simiUir kind which may seem astonishing to those who do not know 
the theory by which they are reached. 

I have shown that it is sulhcient to see the wingi)f a bird, or even 
the bones of the forearm of that wing, to deduce the dimensions of the 
sternum.' These relations have not, as far as I am aware, been indi- 
cated by anatomists. They are as follows: Birds with small wings 
have the sternum long and narrow; those with the large wings have 
that bone broad and short. This relation is easy to verify on the skele- 
tons of birds in zoological collections. The considerations wdiich led 
me to predict this are as follows : 

In w^atching the flight of birds it is seen that large-winged species 
have wing beats of but slight extent. This is because the large sur- 
face of their wings finds a strong resistance in the air. Species that 
have but little wing surface have, on the contrary, wing beats of great 
amplitude in order by motor work and by the length of the i^ath 
described to make amends for the feeble resistance. Having .such dis- 
similar movements, these two kinds of birds ought to have correspond- 
ing differences in the great pectoral muscles that lower the wings. In 
the first these muscles are large and short; in the second, long and 
slender. But the sternum, in the lateral fossa^ of which these muscles 
are inserted, must correspond in its form to that of the muscles them- 
selves. It must therefore be broad and short in the first type of birds, 
long and narrow in the second. All sorts of intermediate forms exist 
between these two extremes. 

A comparison of the skeletons of birds shows that it is really so. 
Still, gallinaceous birds seem to offer an exception to the rule; they 
have a sternum too short for the small surface of their wings. But in 
these species the great length of the coracoid bones really prolongs the 
sternum, so that the exception to the general rule is only apparent. 

The same kind of relations led me to predict, from the conformation 
of the muscles of the calf, a curious i)eculiarity of the skeleton of the 
negro. Comparing the calves of the negro with those of the white man 
it is seen that in the first the gastrocnemii are much longer and more 
slender, which allows us to conclude that the muscles have less force 
but more range of motion in the black race. Now, to get tlie same 
results of work expended in walking, it is necessary that the muscles 
should act upon a longer lever; or, to state it otherwise, that the dis- 
tance should be greater between the end of the calcaneum and the center 
of movement in the ankle joint. Measurements show that this predic-

WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT TARIS. 409 

tion is correct; the difference in the leiigtli of tUe calcaiieiim in the two 
races is enormous, the ratio being as 7 is to 5. 

The constant examination of the physiohigical rehitions existing 
between the form of the h)comotor organs and the type of locomotion 
in the different species of animals is tlie directing idea of the studies 
that are pursued at the Tliysiological Station. Tliere is no doubt that 
every advance in our knowledge of the movements of locomotion will 
bring out more clearly the perfect harmony that exists between an 
organ and its function. 

VI. 

I have tried to show by examples the happy effect of a union between 
comparative anatomy and physiology. Anatomy alone may reveal cer- 
tain unexplained relations between organs — the law of the subordina- 
tion (»f characters is of this nature — but the law of harmony between 
organs and their functions is deduced from accpiaintance with the 
physiological activities of each part of the body; it does not content 
itself with simply stating the fact, but explains it, and thus completely 
satisfies the mind. 

This is not yet all. Naturalists have always sought to ascertain how 
the conformity between an organ and its functions is actually brought 
about. From this research originated the doctrine of final causes 
which has, in our days, been replaced by more satisfactory hypotheses 
tending to show that the different types of animals have been evolved 
during the iirogress of ages by the action of forces effecting a closer and 
closer adaptation to the varying conditions in which they are placed. 
This is the doctrine of transformism or evolution. 

But how shall we explain, in its turn, this evolution by the action of 
natural forces? Certain zoologists, like Buftbn and Lamarck, admit 
that exterior influences may, in a more or less direct way, induce modi- 
fications of organs; others, such as Darwin and Wallace, hold that 
certain variations are transmitted by heredity when their effect is such 
as to better adapt the beings that possess them for living in the condi- 
tions in which they are placed, and to better fit them to resist agencies 
that cause their destruction. 

Twenty years ago, in discussing these two hypotheses,' I ventured to 
hope that experimentation might decide this question, or at least assign 
an equitable part to the different factors of ev^olution. The eminent 
surgeon, J. Guerin, struck at seeing, after luxations, a tendency to the 
formation of a new joint with cartilages, synovial membrane, and liga- 
ments, said " Function makes the organ." This aphorism exj^resses 
the ideas of Lamarck and Buffon; certain pathological cases amount, 
indeed, to actual experiments, and show that, in a living being, mechan- 
ical forces may bring about an a<laptation of organs resulting in a 
change in their functions.

410 WORK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS. 

Guided by certain theories it occurred to me tbat tbc muscular sys- 
tem uiiylit also be modified and the form of a muscle changed by 
altering- the range of its movements. The result, as we shall see, has 
confirmed my anticipations. 

Let us take up again the well-marked example of the unequal length 
of the gastrocnemii muscles in the white man and in the negro. If the 
white man, as we have said, has the shorter calf, it is on account of 
the shortness of his calcaneuni. Suppose that the length of the calca- 
neum in an animal is diminished. If the muscle adapts itself to the 
new conditions of work it ought to diminish in length. 

The rabbit is well adapted for such an experiment. It has a very 
long calcaneum, and consequently the extensor nuiscles (»f the foot 
have very long, red fibers. 1 resected in a rabbit a third of the length 
of the calcaneuni, and placed the limb operated uj^on in a x)laster cast 
until the bone was entirely united. The animal was then set free in a 
large yard, where soon it was running about with as much agility 
as its companions. At the end of a year the rabbit was killed and it 
was seen that upon the side operated upon the muscles had become 
modified in accordance with the theory. The red fibers were redu(;ed 
to about a third of their length and replaced by tendon. A com- 
j)arison of the sound limb with that operated upon showed this change 
in a striking manner. 

I made an experiment which was the converse of this by an oiier- 
ation upon a kid. In this species only the ungual extremity of the foot 
strikes the ground, and the calcaneum, always raised, moves but slightly 
in walking. The resection of this bone had, therefore, but little 
effect either upon the mode of locomotion of the animal or upon the 
character of its muscles. 

Finally IM. W. Roux has given numerous examples of the modifica- 
tions of the muscles of man after partial anchyloses which reduced, 
more or less, the range of movements. He has shown in a great num- 
ber of autopsies a diminution in tlie length of the red fibers and their 
replacement by tendon. This diminution in length was always proj)or- 
tional to the reduction which had occurred in the range of movement. 

The adaptations of muscles to mechanical conditions experimentally 
created by nuitilations is then well established. It is more than prob- 
able that similar adaptations may be obtained in the length of the 
muscles of animals by jjlacing them in conditions where they would be 
forced to make movements more extensive than those of their normal 
life, by obliging them, for examjjle, to leap or climb to get their food. 
I will shortly cite some facts of this kind. 

But even if it is shown that in an individual the muscles and the 
skeleton become adapted to conditions of work, this would not be sutti- 
cient to explain transformism. It is, in fact, necessary, in order to cause 
a variation of species, that the modification aciiuired by individuals 
should be transmitted to their descendants by heredity. 



WOBK OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATION AT PARIS. 411 

Now, except in certain rare cases, the effects of the mutilation of peri- 
pheral organs are not transmitted to the oftspring. Bnt it is not the same 
with lesions that affect the uervons system. This fact has been well 
established by the experiments of Brown-Sequard. In guinea pigs 
this eminent physioh)gist saw cnrions deformations of the limbs and 
exophthalmia produced as a consequence of nervous lesions; and these 
modifications may be transmitted hereditarily throughout a long series 
of generations. It seems that in such cases the traumatism has affected 
fnnction at its very origin; that is to say, in the organ placed at the 
head of the physiological hierarchy. 

There is, indeed, an evident subordination among the different parts 
of the organism; the nervous system conceives acts and directs them 
to be carried out; the muscles perform these acts; the bones and the 
articulations bear the strains. May we not suppose that some ncAv 
exterior circumstances excite in an unaccustomed manner the nervous 
system of an animal so that new conditions bring about new acts and 
consequently lead to a modification of organs? The modifications thus 
produced would be transmissible by heredity as in the experiments of 
Brown-Seqnard. We might thus explain the transformation of animals 
during the lapse of ages: The variations of the environment create 
new needs and excite to new acts, affecting first the nervous system, 
which gradually modifies the organs subordinate to it. 

Thus in the course of the past two centuries the breed of race horses 
has diverged markedly from its primitive form. The excitation to 
more rapid and more energetic muscular action is the cause of the 
modifications revealed by comparative anatomy, which are in great 
l^art hereditarily transmitted. 

Jonathan Franklin states that kangaroos bred in captivity, having 
no longer as in their natural habitat to bound over the tall grass, begin 
to use their fore limbs for walking and running, while they lose in part 
the robust character of their tails and the power of their hind legs. 
M. Tegetmeier' states that rabbits, although imported into Australia in 
quite recent times, have already shown notable modifications, and have 
acquired by climbing trees habits which they did not have in the country 
of their origin. These facts and other similar ones should be rigor- 
ously investigated. The physiological and anatomical modifications of 
all such cases should be determined with precision, so as to ascertain 
if they correspond. If these modifications are real and their heredi- 
tary transmission is well established the theory of evolution will be 
experimentally demonstrated. 

You see how many questions present themselves and how vast is the 
experimental field in which the Physiological Station may be used. I 
hope that I may have inspired you with a desire to seek a solution to 
all these problems. The task is long and difficult, but it is not beyond 
the scope of the exi)erimental methods at our disposal.

As for myself, I am no longer at an age wlieii great projects are pos- 
sible. It is my desire to associate in my enterprise tbose wlio may 
have the time and the necessary force to continue it. For this reason I 
ask you to make use of the resources of the Physiological Station. You 
will find there means of study applicable to the most varied subjects 
and sometimes even pecuniary subsidies, too often wanting to workers. 

Nothing conduces more to the development of science than the asso- 
ciation in the same work of men whose knowledge and ai)titudes differ. 
Physicists, machinists, anatomists, and physiologists mutually enlighten 
and supplement each other. The animal organism will otter to them a 
valuable field of study, for in its i)hysical and mechanical plienomenait 
gives simple and admirable solutions of an infinity of problems. 

This idea that ditterent branches of knowledge should be brought 
together is not a new one; it has been considered in the organization 
of our great establishments for superior instruction, but the combina- 
tion is not made in an eftective manner; physicists, chemists, and 
mathematicians work near each other, but they do not work together. 
And this results from the very necessities of teaching, which, in order 
to secure clearness of exposition and good methods, must necessarily 
present each branch of science as isolated from the others and suffi- 
cient unto itself. 

The fusion of different sciences can not l>e effected at this time except 
in matters of research ; this promises important discoveries, but we must 
not ask of it the material for regular teaching. The Physiological Sta- 
tion is simply an establishment for original research, where 1 invite you 
to unite your ettbrts and your learning for the resolution of the prob- 
lems that I have just concisely placed before you. If you respond to 
ray appeal, each of you, I am sure, will find it to his ])rofit. 

As for myself, 1 shall owe you the gratification for which I am most 
ambitious, that of having been useful. 



THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.^ 



By Ai>FREi) R. Wallace. 



I. 

The modern (loctriiie of orjjfanic. evolution may be said to date from 
the great FreucU naturalist BiilTou, who, more than a hundred years 
before the publication of the Origin of Species, clearly indicated his 
belief in the mutability of specific and generic forms, although, owing 
to the power of the church in liis day, he was often obliged to veil his 
o})iuions under the guise of hypotheses, which, as they were opi)osed to 
religion, of course could not be true. Yet he occasionally speaks very 
plainly, as when he says : 

"Nature, I maintain, is in a state of continual tlux and movement;" 

and again — 

"What cannot nature effect with such means at her disposal? She 
can do all except either create matter or destroy it. These two 
extremes of power the Deity lias reserved for. Himself <mly; creation 
and destruction are the attributes of His omnipotence. To alter and 
uiulo, to develop and renew — these are powers which He has handed 
over to the charge of nature." 

Dr. Erasnuis Darwin held similar views, which he developed at great 
length, and in doing so anticipated many of the arguments afterwards 
elaborated by the celebrated Lamarck, that changes in species were 
caused both by the direct action of the environment, by the use and 
exercise by animals of their several organs, and more especially by the 
effects of eftbrt and desire leading to the development of parts and 
organs calculated to gratify those desires. The great French natural- 
ists Geoffrey and Isidore St. Hilaire- adopted these views with certain 
modifications, as did a limited number of German naturalists: while 
they were popularly set forth with much knowledge and literary skill 
by the late Robert Chambers in his Vestiges of Creation. Somewhat 
later the general theory of evolution was explained and illustrated by 
Herbert Spencer with so much power and comi)leteness as to compel 
its acceptance by most thinkers; but neither he, nor any of the great

414 THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 

writers who had gone before him, had been able to overcome the diffi- 
cnlty of explaining the process of organic evolntion, since no one had 
been able to sliow how the wonderful and complex adaptations of living 
things to their envh-onnient could have been produced by means of 
known laws and through causes proved to exist and to be of sufficient 
potency. Alike for naturalists, for men of science in general, and for 
students in philosoi)hy, the method of organic evolution remained an 
insolvable prol)lem. 

Considering that this state of opinion prevailed up to the very date 
of publication of the Origin of Species, the effect produced by that work 
was certainly marvelous. A considerable body of the more thoughtful 
naturalists at once accepted it as affording, if not a complete solution, 
yet a professional theory, founded upon incontrovertible facts of nature, 
demonstrating a true cause for specitic modification, and affording a 
satisfactory explanation of those countless phenomena of adaptation 
Avliicli every i)reccding theory had been powerless to exi)lain. Further 
consideration and discussion only increased the reputation of the author 
and the influence of his work, which was still further enhanced by his 
Animals and Plants under Domestication, published nine years later; 
and when tliis had been fully considered — about twelve years after the 
publication of the Origin — a large proportion of naturalists in every 
part of the world, including many of the most eminent, had accepted 
Darwin^s views, and acknowledged that his theory of natural selection 
constituted — to use his own words — "the main but not the exclusive 
means of modification." The effect of Darwin's work can only be com- 
pared with that of Newton's Principia. Both writers defined and 
clearly demonstrated a hitherto unrecognized law of nature, and both 
were able to apply the law to the explanation of phenomena and the 
solution of problems which had baflled all previous writers. 

Of late years, however, there has arisen a reaction against Darwin's 
theory as affording a satisfactory explanation of organic evolution. In 
America, especially, the theories of Lamarck are being resuscitated as 
of eijual validity with natural selection; while in this country, besides 
a considerable number of l>amarckians, some influential writers are 
introducing the conception of there being definite positions of organic 
stabdity, quite independent of utility and therefore of natural selection; 
and that those positions are often reached by discontinuous variation — 
that is, bysi)urts or sudden leaps of considerable amount, which are 
thus "competent to mold races without any help whatever from the 
l)rocess of selection, whether natural or sexual."^ These views have 
been recently advocated in an important work on variation,^ which 
seems likely to have much in rtuence among certain classes of natural- 
ists ; and it is because I believe such views to be w^holly erroneous and

to constitute a backward step in the study of evolution that I take this 
opportunity of setting forth tlie reasons for my adverse opinion in a 
manner likely to attract the attention not only of naturalists but of all 
thinkers who are interested in these in-oblems. 

Before proceeding- to this special discussion it may be well to illustrate 
briefly the essential difference between the theories of Darwin and 
those of his predecessors and oponents, by a few examples of those 
cases of adaptation which are insoluble by all other theories, but of 
which natural selection gives an intelligible explanation. 

The Darwinian theory is based on certain facts of nature which, 
though long known to naturalists, were not understood in their rela- 
tions to each other and to evolution. These facts are: Variation, rapid 
multiplication, and the resulting struggle for existence and survival 
of the httest. Variation is the fundamental fact, and its extent, its 
diversity, and its importance are only now becoming fully recognized. 
Observation shows that when large numbers of individuals of common 
species are compared there is a considerable amount of variability in 
size, form, color, in number of repeated parts, and other characters. 
Further, that each sei)arate part which has been thus compared 
varies, so that it may be safely asserted that there is no part or organ 
that is not subject to continual variation. Again, all these variations 
are of considerable amount — not minute, or infinitesimal, or even small, 
as they are constantly asserted to be. And, lastly, the parts and 
organs of each individual vary greatly among themselves, so that each 
sei>arate character, though sometimes varying in correlation with other 
characters, yet possesses a considerable amount of independent varia- 
bility. The amount of the observed variation is so great that in fifty 
or a hundred adult individuals of the same sex, collected at the same 
time and place, the difiierence of the extreme from the mean value of 
any organ or part is usually from one-tenth to one-fourth, sometimes 
as great as one-third, of the mean value, with usually a perfect grada- 
tion of intervening values. 

The multiplication of individuals of all species is so great and so 
rapid that only a small proportion of those born each year can possibly 
survive; hence the struggle for existence, the result of which is that, 
on the average, those individuals which are in any way ill fitted for the 
conditions of existence die, while those better fitted live. The struggle 
is of varied character and intensity — either with the forces of nature, as 
cold, drought, storms, floods, snow, etc. ; with other creatures, in order 
to escape being devoured, or to obtain food, whether for themselves or 
for their offspring; or with their own race in the competition for mates 
and for the means of existence; while as regards all these forms of 
struggle mental and social qualities are often as important as mere 
physical perfection, and sometimes much more important. The fact 
already stated, of the large amount of variability in most species, has 
been thought by some to show either that there can be no such severe 



416 THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 

stiuggle as has been suggested, or that the eliaractei's which vary so 
much can be of little impoitauce to the species, and can not theiefoie 
determine survival. But in making tliese objections two consideratious 
have been overlooked. In the first place, we always compare adults, 
and an enormous amount of destruction has already taken i)lace during 
the earlier stages of life. The adults therefore are already a selected 
group. In the second idace, the struggle is very largely intermittent, 
owing both to the occurrence only at long intervals of the most adverse 
meteorological conditions, while the diversity of these conditions leads 
in each case to the selection of a different characteristic. An excep- 
tionally severe winter will destroy all which are deficient in one set of 
characters, while a long drought, or scarcity of some particular kind <jf 
food, will weed out those deficient in another set of characters. Thus in 
anj' one year there will exist numbers of individuals which are doomed 
to speedy destruction under some one of the special adverse conditions 
which are constantly recurring; and it is this, probably, that explains 
why there is so much individual variati<m continually i)resent, although 
the central or typical form remains unchanged for very long periods. 
This typical form is that which, under existing conditions, survives all 
the i)eriodical or secular adverse changes, during which the outlying or 
extreme variations of whatever kind are sooner or later eliminated. It 
is for want of giving full M'eight to the essentially intermittent nature 
of the struggle for existence that so many writers fail to grasp its full 
significance and continually set forth objections and difficulties which 
have no real importance. 

We are now in a position to estimate the efiiciency of Darwin's theory 
in explaining the wondrous and complex adaptations that abound in the 
organic world, as compared with that of Lamarck or of his modern sup- 
])orters. And first l^t us take the simple case of the adaptation of 
fleshy and juicy fruits to be eaten by birds, causing what seems at first 
sight an injury to the species, but which is really most beneficial, inas- 
much as it leads to the wide dispersal of the seeds, and greatly aids in 
the ])erpetuation of the plants Avhich produce such fruits. To what 
])ossible direct action of the environment can we impute the production 
of fleshy or jui(;y pulp, with attractive color and with small, hard-coated 
seeds, in the innmuerable fruits which are devoured by birds, through 
whose bodies the seeds i)ass in a state fitted for germination? There 
is here a combination of characters calculated to a certain end, a defi- 
nite adaptation. If we suppose that in an early stage of development 
ancestral fruits which happened to be a little softer than others were 
eaten by birds, how could that circumstance increase the softness, 
develop juice, and i)rodu('e color in future generations of the trees or 
bushes that sprang Irom the Seeds so dispeised ? And if we assume 
that these several characteristics are positions of "organic stability," 
acquired through accidental variation, we have to ask why the several 
kinds of variation occurred together, or Avhy neither of them occurred 



THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 417 

iu tlic numerous species iu wliicli to be eaten by birds would be injurious 
instead of beneficial. 

But if we be,i;iu at the same stage and apply the Darwinian theory, 
we find that the whole process is easy of explanation. It is au observed 
fact that fruits vary in softness, juiciness, and color, and seeds in the 
hardness or hairiness of their integuments. Any variation of primitive 
fruits in either of these directions would therefore be beneficial, by 
attracting birds to eat them and so disperse the seeds that they might 
reach suitable stations for development and growth. Such favora- 
ble variations would therefore be preserved while the less favorable 
perished. 

Now, ask the same questions as to the production of the innumerable 
modes of dispersal of seeds by tlie wind, from the sim])Ie compressed 
form and dilated margins of many small seeds to the winged seeds of 
the ash and njaple, and the wonderful feathery parachute of the thistle 
and the dandelion. Or again, inquire as to the wonderful springed 
fruits which burst so as to scatter the small seeds, as in some of the bal- 
sams; or yet again, as to the sticky glands of the sundews, and the 
small water traps of the bladder wort; and a hundred other equally 
strange adaptations to some purpose of use to the species, but whose 
development has no relation whatever to any possible direct action of 
the environment, though all of them are exjilicable as the result of the 
successive i)reservation of such variations as are known to occur, act- 
ing at various intervals, and by means of successive modifications, dur- 
ing tiie whole |)eriod of the development of the grou}) from some remote 
ancestral form. 

The modern advocates of Lamarckism content themselves with such 
simple cases as the strengthening or enlarging of organs by use, the 
hardening of the sole of the foot by pressure, or the enlarging of the 
stomach by the necessity for eating large quantities of less nutritious 
food. These, and many other similar modifications, may doubtless be 
exi^lained by the direct action of conditions, if we admit that the change 
thus produced in the individual is transmitted to the offspring. That 
such changes are transmitted has, however, not yet been proved, and a 
considerable body of naturalists reject such transmission as im})robable 
in itself, and at all events as not to be assumed without full and suffi- 
cient proof. But even if accepted it will not help us to explain the 
very great number of iuq)ortant adaptations which, like those already 
refierred to, are quite unrelated to any direct action of the environment. 
Having thus cleared away some preliminary misconceptions, and stated 
in briefest outline the main features of the law of natural selection, we 
may proceed to consider the objections of those modern writers to whose 
works we have already referred. 

Mr. Bateson's large and important volume consists mainly of au 
extensive collection of cases of variation of a ])articular kind, which 
have been met with throughout the whole animal kingdom, and have 
SM 94 27 



418 THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 

beeu recorded in all parts of tlie world. These are arranged systematic- 
ally under nearly nine Imndred numbered headings, and are in many 
cases well illustrated by cliaracteristic figures. The character and mor- 
phological relations of these variations are often very fully discussed 
with great knowledge and acuteness, and some original views are set 
forth which are of interest both to morphologists and physiologists. 
So far as this part of the work is concerned the present writer would 
feel himself quite incompetent to criticise it, but would welcome it as 
presenting in aconveuieut form a great body of interesting and little- 
known facts. But the book goes far beyond this. The first words of the 
preface tell us that ^'This book is offered as a contribution to the study 
of the problem of species;" and in a lengthy introductory and shorter 
concluding chapters this problem is discussed in some detail, with the 
view of discrediting the views held by most Darwinians; while a new 
theory, founded upon the facts given in the body of the work, is set 
forth as being a more probable one. It is therefore necessary to give 
some account of the nature of the facts themselves, as well as of the 
particular theories they are held to support. 

Darwin distinguished two classes of variations, which he termed 
"individual differences" and "sports." The former are small but 
exceedingly numerous, the latter large but comparatively rare, and these 
last are the "discontinuous variations" of Mr. Bateson to which refer- 
ence has been already made. Darwin, while always believing that indi- 
vidual differences played the most important part in the origin of species, 
did not altogether exclude sports or discontinuous variations, but he 
soon became convinced that these latter were quite unimportant, and 
that they rarely, if ever, served to originate new species; and this view 
is held by most of his followers. Mr. Bateson, however, seems to 
believe that the exact contrary is the fact, and that sports or discon- 
tinuous variations are the all-important, if not the exclusive, means by 
which the organic world has been modified. Such a complete change 
of base as to the method of organic evolution deserves, therefore, to be 
considered in some detail. 

The difficulty which seems to have struck Mr. Bateson most, and 
which he declares to be of "immense significance," is that while spe- 
cific forms of life form a discontinuous series, the diverse environments 
on whicli these primarily depend shade into each other insensibly, and 
form a continuous series (p. 5). Further on this objection is again 
urged in stronger language: "We have seen that the differences 
between species are specific, and are differences of kind, forming a 
discontinuous series, while the diversities of environment to which they 
are subject are on the whole differences of degree, and form a continu- 
ous series; it is therefore hard to see how the environmental differences 
can thus be in any sense the directing cause of specific differences, 
which by the theory of natural selection they should be" (p. 16). 
Again, at page 09, he urges that the essential character of species is 



THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 419 

that they constitute a discontinuous series, and lie asks "Is it not 
then possible that the discontinuity of species may be a consequence 
and expression of the discontinuity of variation T' He then states 
that on the received hypothesis, "Variation is continuous, and the dis- 
continuity of species results from the operation of selection." This, 
liowever, is not quite a correct statement of the received hypothesis if 
"discontinuous" is used in Mr. Bateson's sense, as including every 
change of color which is not by minute gradation, and every change in 
number of repetitive parts — as of vertebric, or of the joints of an antenna, 
or the rings of a worm — which is not by a gradation of the part from 
a minute rudiment. Such changes of color or in the number of parts 
are admitted by all Darwinians as, in many cases, constituting a part 
of that individual variation on which modification of species depends. 
It is, however, on the sui)posed rejection of this class of variations by 
Darwinians that he bases what he terms "an almost fatal objection" 
to their theory. 

lieturning, however, to the supposed overwhelming imi)ortance of 
discontinuous variation, we pass on to the last chapter of the book, 
headed " (Jonclnding reflections," and we read : "The first object of this 
work is not to set forth in the present a doctrine, or to advertise a solu- 
tion of the problem of species," and then follows immediately a further 
discussion of this very theory of discontinuity, which is set forth as a 
doctrine, and as a help to the solution of that problem. We are told 
that the difficulties of the accepted view "have oppressed all who have 
thought upon these matters for themselves, and they have caused some 
anxiety even to the faithful;" it is urged that "the discontinuity of 
which species is an expression has its origin not in the environment, 
nor in any phenomenon of adaptation, but in the intrinsic nature of 
organisms themselves, manifested in the original discontinuity of varia- 
tion ;" that, "the existence of sudden and discontinuous variation, that 
is to say, of new forms having from their first beginning more or less 
of the kind of perfection that we associate with normality, is a fact that 
disposes, once and for all, of the attempt to interpret all perfection and 
deflniteness of form as the work of selection." And then comes the 
positive statement "theexistenceof discontinuity in variation is there- 
fore a final proof that the accepted hyi)othesis is inadequate" (j). 568), 
and after several more pages of illustration and argument, the final 
conclusion is reached that "it is quite certain that the distinctness and 
discontinuity of many characters is in some unknown way a part of 
their nature, and is not directly dependent upon natural selection at all." 

Before going further it will be well to make a few observations on 
these very definite and positive conclusions at which Mr. Bateson has 
arrived ; and it must be remembered that this volume deals only with 
one portion of the subject even of discontinuous variation, which is 
itself, if we exclude monstrosities, only a small fragment of the whole 
subject of variation. The impression that will be produced on those 



420 THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 

wlio luive given special attention to the relations of living organisms to 
each other and to their inorganic environment will be that of an aca- 
demic discussion, dealing to a large extent with Avords rather than with 
the actual facts of nature. The author's main point that si)eeies form 
a discontinuous series, and that specific differences can not, therefore, 
have been produced by any action of the environment, because that 
environment is continuous — an argument which, as we have seen, he 
dwells ui)on and reiterates with emphasis and i)ersistency — rests wholly 
upon the obvious IVillacies that in each single locality the environment 
of every species found there is the same, aud that all change of envi- 
ronment, whether in space or time, is continuous. To take this latter 
})oiiit first, nothing can be more abru])t than the change often due to 
diversity of soil, a sharp line dividing a pine or heather clad moor from 
calcareous hills; or to differences of level, as from a marshy plain to dry 
u[)lands; or, for aquatic animals, fnmi the open sea to an estuary, or 
from a uontidal stream to an isolated pond. And when, in the course 
of geological time, an island is separated from a continent, or volcanic 
outbursts build up oceanic islands, the immigrants whicli n^ach such 
islands undergo a. change of environment which is in a higli degree 
discontinuous. 

pjven more important, perhaps, is the fact that everywhere the 
environment as a whole is made up of an unlimited number of sub- 
environments, each of which alone, or nearly alone, affects a single 
si)ecies, as familiarly included in the term "their conditions of exist- 
ence." The mole and the hedgehog may live together in the saujc 
general environment, yet their actual environments are very dilferent, 
owing to their different kinds of ibod, habits, and enemies. The same 
thing api)lies to the rabbit and the hare, the rook and the crow, the 
ring snake and the viper; aud still more when we look at animals of 
greater diversity, as the otter and the badger, the dung beetle and the 
cockchafer, and a hundred others that might be quoted. Now, though 
all these creatures may be found together in the same area, each of 
them lias its own "environment," to which it must be adapted in order 
to maintain its existence. Many species, liowever, live, as it were, on 
the borders of two distinct environments, as when they obtain differ- 
ent kinds of food at different i>eriods, being then exposed to different 
enemies and varied (dimatic effects. In such cases, it is easy to see 
that a small modification of structure might enable them advanta- 
geously to cliange their habits, and thus obtain what would be practi- 
cally a different environment. This is well seen in those closely allied 
species whicli have somewhat different modes of life, as the meadow 
pipit (A«///»-s' j>>7//r».s'/.s-) aud the tree i[)i\)it {An fliK.s <(rborei(s), the former 
having a long, nearly straight claw^ to the hind toe, a more slender bill, 
and a rather greener tinge of coloring, a llmodifications suited to its 
different habits and distinct physical surroundings. Here we have an 
example in nature of how^ environments, even when continuous as a 



THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 421 

whole, may become quite discontinuous in relation to two species dif- 
fering in very slight characters. Darwin dwelt much upon this phe- 
nomenon of new species being- formed when any body of individuals 
seized upon vacant places in the economy of nature, and by means of 
comparatively slight variations became adapted to it. It is what we 
see everywhere in the world around us. 

It thus api)ears that what is evidently supposed to be a very power- 
ful argument, leading to the conclusion that discontinuous variations 
as a class are those which are of vital, if not exclusive, importance in 
the production of new species, entirely breaks down when confronted 
with the facts of nature. It does not, however, follow that because an 
unsound a priori argument has been used to call attention to these vari- 
ations, and because they have been set before the world in a way to 
suggest that their importance in relation to the origin of species is a 
new discovery calculated to revolutionize the study of this branch of 
biology, they are therefore of no value in this connection. We will 
therefore now proceed to consider them on their own merits as possible 
factors in the process of organic evolution. For this purpose we must 
briefly indicate the nature of the variations so laboriously recorded in 
this volume. 

Tiiese consist of what are termed meristic variations; that is, varia- 
tions in the number or position of parts which occur in series, whether 
linear, bilateral, or radial. Such are the variations in the number of 
segments of annulosa and arthropoda, such as worms, leeches, centi- 
pedes, etc.; in the antenna? and legs of insects; in the vertebne, ribs, 
teeth, nipples, limbs, and toes of vertebrates; in the rays of starfish, 
encrinites, and allied animals. The ocelli and other symmetrical mark- 
ings on tlie wings of bntterflies are also recorded, as well as numerous 
malformations when these affect serial or symmetrical organs. 

On carefully looking through the cases of variation in this volume, 
we are struck with the largo })roportion of them which exhibit more or 
less deformation or want of symmetry, culminating in the ^'arious kinds 
of monstrosity. In Chai^ter III, on the variations of vertebra^ and ribs, 
we find vertebra- imperfectly divided in snakes and frogs. Numerous 
cases of abnormalities in human vertebra- are given, usually exhibiting 
asymmetry or deformation, and similar variations are found in the 
anthropoid ajies, but here there is apparently more of regularity and 
symmetry. Tlie greatest amount of this kind of variation occurs in 
the sloths, as might be expected when we consider that they are the 
most abnormal of mammals as regards the cervical vertebra;. In Chap- 
ter VIII immerous cases of superinimerary mamma^ are recorded, almost 
all of which are unsynunetrical. The variations in the number or form 
of the horns in sheep, goats, and deer recorded in Chapter XI show 
them to be usually more or less irregular. 

Xearly a hundred pages are devoted to the digits (fingers and toes) 
of mammals and birds, about one hundred and forty cases of variation 



422 THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 

being recorded. Almost tlie whole of these present, more or less, want 
of symmetry, while a large proportion, as the double-handed and double- 
footed children and the six or seven toed cats, can only be classed as 
monstrosities. 

In succeeding chapters the variations in the antenuiB and leg joints 
of insects; in the radial parts of medusie and encrinites; in the medial 
structures of fish, insects, mollusks, etc., which become sometimes 
double; in the eyes and coloration of tiattish; in duplicate or branch- 
ing legs of insects and crustaceans; in extra limbs of batrachia; and, 
lastly, double monsters, are all discussed at great length, and are illus- 
trated by a number of very interesting woodcuts. But almost the whole 
of these can only be classed as malformations or monstrosities which 
are entirely without any direct bearing on the problem of the '' origin 
of species." 

Nothing can better show the small value of the book from this, which 
is the author's own, point of view than the large amount of space 
devoted to the various monstrosities of the hands and feet of man and of 
some of the mammalia. Not only throughout all mammals, but also in 
the case of birds, reptiles, and amphibia, five is the maximum number 
of the toes or fingers. These may vary in size or in proportions, they 
may be reduced in number by coalescence, or by the loss of the lateral 
digits; they may be strangely modified in form and function, as in the 
flappers of the whale or in the wing of the bat, yet never once in the 
whole long series of land vertebrates do they exceed five in number. 
Yet we have six, seven, or eight fingered, double-handed, or double- 
footed children; similar malformations in monkeys; six and seven toed 
cats; four, five, or six toed pigs; double footed birds, and other mon- 
strosities, described at great length, and all their peculiarities discussed 
in the most minute detail and from various points of view, in a work 
presented to us as "a contribution to tlje study of the problem of 
species." Many of these malformations have been observed among 
animals in a state of nature, and, in fact, Mr. Batesou believes that they 
occur as frequently among wild as among domesticated animals. Con- 
sidering how rarely the former cases can be observed, they must be 
everywhere occurring; yet in no single instance do they seem to have 
established themselves as a race or local variety on however small 
a scale. Yet we know that in the case of the six-toed cats, and prob- 
ably in other cases, they are easily transmissible; and we must there- 
fore conclude that all these irregularities and monstrosities are in a 
high degree disadvantageous, since when subject to free competition 
with the normal form in a state of nature they never survive, even for 
a few generations. 

As the volume we are discussing is entirely devoted to variations in 
the number or position of the serial parts of organisms in relation to 
the origin of species, it becomes necessary to lay some stress upon the 
very familiar, but apparently overlooked, fact that, among all the higher 



THE METHOD OP ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 423 

types of life at all events, the most stable of all characters, and the 
most permanent during long periods of evolution, and througliout 
changes which have led to the production of a marvelous variety and 
abundance of specific forms, are these very characters of the number 
and relative positions of serial organs; whence it follows that varia- 
tions of this kind can only have led to specific changes at enormously 
long intervals, and that, as a general rule, they can have had nothing 
whatever to do with the origin of an overwhelming majority of living 
species. 

First we have tlie four limbs of vertebrates, which, among all the 
marvelous variety of form and function, on land, in the water, or in the 
air, is never exceeded, and appears to have been fixed at a very early 
stage of the development of the vertebrate type. Equally fixed, and 
extending through a still vaster range of modifications of specific forms, 
are the six legs and four wings of true insects, which, as in vertebrates, 
may be reduced but never increased in number. Still more extraordi- 
nary, because less obviously connected with the main structure and 
functions of the organism, is the limitation and permanence in the num- 
ber of the subdivisions of limbs and other appendages. There is no 
obvious reason why in land vertebrates the divisions of the hand and 
foot should never exceed five, yet not only is this number the maxi- 
mum, but it may be considered tlie nornml number of which all others 
are reductions, since it still prevails largely in the marsupials, rodents, 
carnivores, primates, and lizards; and the five-toed land vertebrates 
(excluding birds) are probably far more numerous than those with a 
lesser number. 

In birds there are only four toes as a maximum, and comparatively 
few have a smaller number. But we have here a peculiarity in the num- 
bers of the toe joints which does not occur in any other vertebrates. 
These form a series in arithmetical progression, the hind toe having 
two and the others three, four, and five joints in regular order; and 
this rule is very nearly universal, the only exceptions being in some of 
the swifts and goatsuckers, whose habits render the feet of compara- 
tively little importance, while their general organization is of a some- 
what low type. 

Coming to insects, we again find the legs consisting of a limited num- 
ber of parts, and, strangely enough, this number is again five — the coxa, 
trochanter, femur, tibia, and tarsus. The tarsus, however, is subdivided 
into small movable joints, and these, too, are five as a maximum, but in 
certain groups are reduced to four, three, or two. The five-jointed tarsus 
is, however, the most prevalent, and in the enormous order of Coleoptera 
or beetles, comprising at least one hundred thousand described species, 
fully half belong to families which have the tarsi five-jointed. Even the 
antennae, although they vary greatly in the number of joints, yet in 
numerous large groups comprising many thousands of species, they 
have the number of joints constant. Another indication of the tendency 
of serial parts to become fixed in number, is the typical limitation of the 



424 THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 

cervical or neck vertebriii of mammalia to seven joints. This number 
is wonderfully constant, being the same in the long necks of the giraffe 
and camel and the very short necks of the hippopotamus, porpoise, and 
7nolc, the only exceptions in the whole class being some of the sloths, 
which have from six to ten, often varying in the same species, and the 
manatee, which has six. 

Now, if M^e consider the enormous extent of these fixed numerical 
relations of important parts of the organism in the higher vertebrates 
and in insects, both as regards the number of living species affected — 
perha])s 99 i)er cent of the whole — and as regards their range in time, 
throughout the whole of the Tertiary and Secondary, ami even a con- 
siderable portion of the Paleozoic periods, and if we take account of the 
vast number of extinct species, genera, and families needful to com- 
plete the various lines of descent from the earliest known forms, pre- 
senting the same numerical relations to those now living, we shall be 
able to form .some conception, however inadequate, of the overwhelming 
frequency and importance of variations in the size, form, proportions, 
and structure of the various- parts and organs of the higher animals, 
as compared with variations in their number. No doubt in the earlier 
stages of organic development numerical variations were more frequent 
and more important, as they are now among the lower forms of life; but 
at a very early period in geological history the main numerical relations 
of the essential parts of the higher organisms became more or less fixed 
and stable, and have in many cases remained unchanged through a 
large proportion of the i)eriod comi^rised in the geological record. The 
four limbs of vertebrates were already established in the fishes of the 
Devonian period, as were the four wings and six legs of true insects in 
the cockroaches and archaic orthoptera of the Carboniferous; and 
almost all subseqiTcnt changes have resulted from modifications of these 
early types. The earliest mammals of which we have sufficient knowl- 
edge have the typical five-toed feet, and the earliest l)irds appear to 
have had the same progressive series of toe joints as now prevails. 

We are thus irresistibly led to the conclusion that, among all the 
possible forms of variation now occurring, those affecting the number 
of imi)ortaiit serial ])arts among higher organisms are those which 
have the least possible relation to whatever modification of species 
may now be going on around us, or which has been going on dur- 
ing a large jiortion of geological time. Yet it is to variations of this 
nature, a large ])ioportion of which are mere malformations or mon- 
strosities, that the bulky and learned volume we are discussing has 
been devoted. The author of this book puts forward these malfor- 
mations and irregularities, mixed up with a proportion of normal 
variations, under the misleading name of '^Discontinuous variations," 
as if they were something new, and had been ignorantly overlooked 
by Darwin and his followers; and he loses no opportunity of telling 
us how important he thinks they are, what difficulties they enable us 



THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 425 

to overcome, and how tliey are the beginnings of the establishment of 
a sure base for the attack on the problems of evolution. In so doing- 
he has entirely failed to grasp the essential features which characterize 
at least 99 per cent of existing species, which are, slight differences 
from their allies in size, form, proportions, or color of the various i^arts 
or organs, with corresponding differences of function and habits, com- 
bined with a wonderful amount of stability in the numerical relations 
of serial parts, extending sometimes only to genera, but more usually 
to families, tribes, orders, or even to whole classes of the higher ani- 
mals. It is differences of the former kind that do actually characterize 
the great majority of species;' they affect those organs which varj^ 
most frequently and most conspicuously in the individuals of every 
fresh generation, and they constitute that individual variation on 
which Darwin always relied as the essential fouiulation of natural 
selection, and which his followers have shown to be fiir more abundant 
and of far greater amount than he was aware of; and, lastly, they 
afford amply sufficient material for the continuous production of new 
forms. Earely in the history of scientific progress has so large a claim 
been made, and been presented to the world with so much confidence 
in its being an epoch-making discovery, as Mr. Bateson's idea of dis- 
continuous variation corres[)onding to and explaining the discontinuity 
of species; yet more rarely has the alleged discovery been supported 
by facts which, though interesting in themselves, are for the most part 
quite outside the general conditions of the complex problem to be 
solved, and are therefore entirely worthless as an aid to its solution. 

Before leaving this part of the subject we may note the extension of 
definite numerical relations to plants as well as to animals. In dico- 
tyledons we have a typical five-petaled flower, or a corolla with five 
divisions, a character which prevails in irregular as well as in regular 
flowers, and often when the stamens are not a multiple of five, as in 
mallows, bignonias, and many others. Some form of fi\ e-parted flower 
l^revails throughout many extensive natural orders, and comprises prob- 
ably a considerable majority of all dicotyledonous plants. A three or 
six parted flower is almost equally a characteristic of monocotyledons, 
prevailing even among the highly specialized and firntastically formed 
Orchidea' and Iridea^, thus again demonstrating how large a portion of 
the si)ecific modifications of organisms are independent of variations 
ill number, but depend wholly upon variations in the size, form, color, 
and structure of the various parts and organs. 

Other matters of importance in Mr. Bateson's work, together with 
some theories recently advanced by Mr. Francis Galton," will be dis- 
cussed in the concluding portion of this article. 

'Mr. Batesoii", however, makes the extraordinary statement that "it is especially 
by differences of number and bj'^ qnalitativo differences that species are commonly 
distinguished" (p. 573). Species makers know too well that, among the higher 
animals at all events, it is not so. 



426 THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 

II. 

Ill the first part of this article the misconceptiou which underlies the 
main body of Mr. Batesou's work has been discussed in some detail. 
We will now deal with some of the minor objections to the views of 
most Darwinians, which are to be found in his lengthy introduction; 
after which the validity of Mr. Francis Galton's doctrine, as to x^osi- 
tions of organic stability (also held by Mr. Bateson), will be considered. 
And first, we note that he uses the usual misleading terms ''minute," 
"minimal," "imperceptible," and "insensible" (p. 15) as applied to the 
individual variations on which Darwin relied, although he has himself 
given figures of beetles and earwigs showing tliat such variations are 
enormous — greater, indeed, tlian in the illustrative cases I have given 
in my Darwinism.^ 

A strong attack is made on the theory of the utility of specific 
characters. It is admitted that an enormous amount of evidence has 
been collected, and that "the functions of many problematical organs 
have been conjectured, in some cases perhaps rightly;" yet he adds, 
"whole groups of common phenomena are still almost untouched even 
by conjecture." He tells us that "many suggestions have been made 
as to the benefits which edible moths may derive from their protective 
coloration, and as to the reasons why unpalatable butterflies in gen- 
eral are brightly colored" (p. 11) ; but neither here nor elsewhere is any 
hint given that more than "suggestions" have been advanced. Consid- 
ering that this is the one branch of the subject in which natural selec- 
tion has been shown to be an actual working reality in natnre by the 
experiments of Jenner Weir, lUitler, Stainton, and Belt, the observa- 
tions of Bates and Fritz Miiller, and especially by the elaborate investi- 
gations of Professor Poulton, it was hardly fair to pass the subject by 
as if nothing had been done but pure conjecture. He also ignores the 
continuous advance that is being made in determining the utilities of 
the innumerable modifications in the forms and arrangement of the 
leaves and other of the nonfloral appendages of plants by Kerner 
Lubbock, and many other observers; as well as the light thrown on 
color and marking as siieciiic characters in the higher animals by the 
consideration of the value of distinctiveness for purposes of rec^ogni- 
tion, a character of life-preserving value in the case of many animals, 
and in all of great importance to reproduction, and an essential factor 
in the differentiation of species. ■ It is, therefore, not correct to say, "But 
as to the particular benefit which one dull moth enjoys as the result 
of his own particular pattern of dullness as comi^ared with the closely 
similar pattern of the next species, no suggestion is made." The sug- 
gestion has been made (Darwinism, ]). 22()), and has been accepted as 
at all events a good working hyx^othesis by many naturalists. On this 
question of the utility of characters which are constant characteristics

THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 427 

of the species, but whose utility is uot apparent to the casual observer, 
Mr, Bateson uses very strong- hiuguage. Eeferring- to the case of two 
ladybirds, the small Coccinella decempunctata being exceedingly vari- 
able, both in color and spotting, the larger C. septempunctata, very 
constant, he says, "To be asked to believe that the color of C. septem- 
punctata is constant because it matters to the species, and that the 
color of C. decempunctata is variable because it does not matter, is to be 
asked to abrogate reason" (p. 572). I fear that I myself must be in this 
sad case, for though I have uot been asked to believe this unreasonable 
thing, yet I do believe it. Of course I may be wroug and ]\[r. Bateson 
right, but how is it that he is so absolutely sure that he is right? 

Before proceeding further we may briefly notice that Mr. Bateson 
seems to imply that the "meristic," or numerical variations, to which 
he has devoted his volume, are altogether ignored by Darwinians in 
their adoption of "individual variations" as opposed to "sports" for 
the main materials on which natural selection works. But this is alto- 
gether erroneous. ]So doubt they would reject nine-tenths of Mr. Bate- 
son's cases as being simply monstrosities, which neither have nor could 
ever have had any part in the production of new species; but they 
always recognize that genera, and even species are sometimes character- 
ized by a ditference in the number or arraugement of serial parts — as 
of vertebra', ribs, teeth, or markings, and that therefore variations of 
this kind are sometimes, though comparatively very rarely, the material 
on which natural selection works. As development seems almost always 
to have proceeded by reduction from large and indefinite numbers of 
serial parts to the minimum number compatible with the maximum of 
utility, an increase in number occurring now may be, as is usually con- 
sidered, a form of reversion, though Mr. Bateson denies that there is 
any such thing in nature. This diminution in number may have occurred 
either by a gradual diminution in size and ultimate disappearance, as 
when limbs of the higher animals have been lost, in whales, the apteryx, 
snakes, etc.; or it may sometimes have been abrupt, which means that 
the rudiment of the part ceased to develop at an early embryonic stage. 
Either mode is quite in harmony with the views of Darwinians, and not 
very much seems to be gained by terming the former "continuous" and 
the latter "discontinuous," especially when this last term is held to 
include almost every kind of monstrosity. 

We have now to consider an eiiually important, though as I consider 
an equally unsubstantial, novelty — the view that there are "definite 
positions of organic stability," which alone are sufficient to mold races 
" without any help whatever" from natural selection. This view appears 
to have originated with Mr. Francis Galton, and was first stated in his 
work on Natural Inheritance, and again in his Eoyal Society paper on 
" Thumb and finger marks." The same view is adopted by Mr. Bateson ; 
and in an article on "Discontinuity in evolution" in Mind (Vol. Ill, 
pp. 302, 372) Mr. Galton approves of Mr. Bateson's work, and restates 
bis latest views on the subject, and these I now propose to consider. 



428 THE METHOD OF ORFANIC EVOLUTION. 

Although Mr. Galtou begins by the consideration of races only, that 
is, of Avell-uiarked forms below the value of species, yet later on he 
api)lies liis tlieory to the evolution of species and of all higher groups. 
Speaking of discontinuous or, as he terms it, transilient variation, he 
says: "A ]ea]> has taken place into a new position of stabiltiy. I am 
unable to conceive the i)ossibility of evolutionary progress except by 
transiliences, for, if they were mere divergences, each subsequent gen- 
eration would teiul to regress backward toward the typical center, and 
tlie advance which has been made would be temporary and could not be 
maintained" (1. c, p. 368.) Mr. (xalton has before implicitly admitted 
that there is sucli a thing as natural selection, yet in this passage he 
reasons as if it liad no existence, and that regression to mediocrity 
would occur Just the same with it as without it. For the essence of 
natural selection isthatit in'cserves and thus increases favorable varia- 
tions by destroying the unfavorable; but this statement by no means 
expresses the real power of selection, which may be better illustrated 
by saying that it destroys abont 99 i^er cent of the bad and less bene- 
ficial variations and iireserves about the 1 per cent of those which are 
extremely favorable. With such an amount of selection how can there 
be any possible " regression backward toward the typical center" when 
any change in the environment demands an advance in some special 
direction beyond it as the only means of preserving the race from 
extinction f Well did Darwin say that unless the universal struggle 
for existence "be thoroughly ingrained in the mind, the whole economy 
of nature, with every fact on distribution, rarity, abundance, extinc- 
tion, and variation will be <limly seen or quite misunderstood." Almost 
all the misconceptions of popular writers against Darwiinsm arise from 
the want of this constantly present recollection ; and as capable and 
instructed writers, such as Mr. Galton and Mr. Bateson, as well as 
capable, but nninstructed writers, such as Lord Salisbury, alike suffer 
in this respect, it is needfnl to again state obvious facts which may 
serve to drive home the overwhelming importance of this factor in 
evolution. 

Let us suppose an animal which lives ten years and produces 10 young 
(5 j)airs) each year, a moderate allowance even for many mammals and 
birds. A little simple arithmetic will show that if none died for five 
years there would be (>,4:80 pairs in place of the 1 pair, or (»,480,000,000 
in place of 1,0(10,000, as the case might be. But it is evident that 
such an average rate of increase for all animals could not go on for even 
one or two years, as no country could suj)ply them with- food. We will 
suppose, then, that only 1 pair, instead of 5, survive each year to breed 
the next year; but if this goes on for the ten years of the life of the 
first pair we shall still have 512 pairs instead of each pair, a number 
which is ecpially impossible. Let us, then, suppose that only one-fiftieth 
part of those born survive, that is, that only 1 individual lives to 
breed out of 5 successive broods of 10 each; even then, at the end 



THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 429 

of teu years, we shall have a ijopulatiou two and a half times as great 
as at first, or, more exactly, if we began with 1,000,000 individuals, then 
in ten years we should have 2,593,743. This is probably something like 
what happens. Forty-nine fiftieths of those born never live to breed, 
yet the population increases steadily so long as conditious are moder- 
ately favorable, the surplus being got rid of at uncertain intervals by 
recurrent unfavorable conditions, so as to keep the number of individ- 
uals on the average about stationary. Looking at it in another way, 
we find that, beginning with 100 individuals whose offsprings each year 
amount to 500, of which only 10 survive to breed, then during ten years 
about 8,000 will have been born, making, with the original iiundred, 
8,100, out of which only the 100 fittest, or nearly tlie fittest, will 
survive, to be again weeded out every successive ten years, or there- 
abouts. Without making some numerical estimate of this kind it is 
impossible to realize the severity of the struggle continually going on 
in nature and the resultant elimination of the unfit. With the above 
figures (which would have to be enormously greater with many species) 
we see that for every 80 born only 1, on the average, survives to 
breed. With such an amount of selection it is evident that whenever 
it hapjiened that the mean point, or "typical center" of the curve of 
variation, ceased to be the most advantageous point in relation to the 
whole conditions of existence, then a new typical center would rai)idly 
be produced by the elimination of all which diverged from it to any 
injurious extent. There could not possibly be regression from the new 
typical center unless the inevitable survival of the fittest in a rapidly 
increasing population can be gotten rid of. 

We are now in a position to discuss Mr. Galton's theory, that there 
are certain variations which possess "organic stability," and that these 
are the real factors of evolution " without any help whatever from the 
process of selection." And first, what is the exact character of these 
stable variations which form races and ultimately new species by their 
own inherent force of stability? Is the stability in relation to the 
actual conditions of the environment or altogether independent of 
those conditions? If the former, how did it come to be in harmony 
with them? If this harmonious relation depends upon a mere chance 
coincidence, we have to consider the comparative rarity of these large 
or discontinuous variations, and that only a small proportion of them 
have the alleged character of " stability." Moreover, this class of vari- 
ations is generally a variation in a single part or organ, and Herbert 
Spencer (as well as many other writers) has argued forcibly that modi- 
fications of single characters would in all cases be useless unless 
accompanied by the correlative modifications of a number of other 
characters. 1 have myself shown that in the case of individual varia- 
tions this is no difficulty, because all characters are varying more or 
less in every generation, and thus the needful harmonious relation 
between the different organs or i)arts can be easily maintained ; but in 



430 THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 

tlie case of these large and rare variations tbe difficulty is an over- 
whelming" one. And we must always remember that these alleged 
" stable " variations, from the first moment of their appearance, can 
not possibly escape from the action of natural selection. As, roughly 
speaking, only about 1 per cent of each generation survives to breed, 
this new form, however stable iu itself, can not become part of that 1 
per cent unless tlie i)articnlar variation which ('characterizes it is either 
beneficial or entirely harmless. But in the latter case it is difficult to 
see what constitutes its superiority over the rest of the species which, 
year by year, by means of this intensely severe process of elimination, 
is kept iu harmony with the environment. If the stability consists in 
greater health, vigor, reproductive power, or intelligence, all these 
qualities have already been developed to the fullest needful extent, 
and these superior individuals will be selected in the usual way. But 
if — as a second alternative — these alleged stable variations are sup 
posed to have some kind of inherent stability independent of tlie 
environment, then, stability jiotwithstauding, tliey would inevitably 
soon succumb uiuler the terrible eliminating power Avhich year by year 
leaves only about 1 per cent of the most fit to survive. There is really 
no escape Jrom this dilemma: If your new variety is among the 1 or 2 
per cent of the most fit, then it does not need this purely imaginary 
quality of " organic stability " in order to survive; if it is not among 
this small body of the most fit — that is, of the best adapted to the 
whole (conditions of existence of the species or race — then, any other 
(piality notwithstanding, it will certainly not survive. 

The term " organic stability " has really no meaning except that of 
harmonious adaptation to the environment as tested and maintained by 
natural selection. To talk about new races or species being produced 
"without any help whatever from natural selection" can, under the 
actual conditions of the terrestrial universe, only mean that there is an 
inherent developmental power which modifies organisms iu definite 
ways, and in more perfect harmony with the environment than has 
been or can be brought about by natural selection, thus kee])ing these 
modified organisms always ahead of the rest. They may thus be said 
to be iiulependent of survival of the fittest, because they and their 
ofts])ring always are the most fit, and therefore always survive ! On 
this theory evolution goes on by the production of new races comjilete 
and ready formed, and in i)erfect harmony with the environment when- 
ever that environment undergoes a change. But no evidence is offered 
for such an extraordinary developmental power being always at work 
and always able to produce adaptation to an ever-changing environ- 
ment. Such a power would be hardly difierent from the old special 
creation, or than the preordained harmony of the philosophers; and it 
would, moreover, have rendered unnecessary and unintelligible that 
rapid ninltiiilication and consequent enormous expenditure of life 
which now prevails. It would ecpially render unnecessary that won- 



THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 431 

derful property of individual variability, whose only use would then be 
to enable man to improve his domestic animals and cultivated plants. 
We should thus have two rival systems at work, and we might almost 
imagine Mr. Sullivan's cosmic spirits — William and James — to be reali- 
ties, and that each had been experimenting in organic development on 
our earth in order to see whose scheme was the most satisfactory.' 

As evidence of the actual existence of this hypothetical "organic 
stability," Mr. Galton adduces the j^atterns in thumb and finger 
marks, which he has so carefully studied. In his Royal Society 
paper on this subject he tells us that these marks fall into definite 
groups and can be systematically classified, and he actually describes 
and figures twentj^-five distinctive patterns arranged under three 
very distinct classes. He then urges that these fundamentally dis- 
tinct classes are strikingly analogous to genera in biology, and as 
the patterns are so insignificant in every way that they can in them- 
selves be neither useful nor ornamental, and can therefore never have 
been the subjects of selection, they prove, he thinks, "that natural 
selection has no monopoly of influence in forming genera, but that it 
could be wholly dispensed with, the internal conditions acting by them- 
selves being amply sufiicient to form them." And it is from the case of 
these finger marks that he considers the reality of positions of organic 
stability has been x^roved, and that they are "comj)etent to mold races 
without any help whatever from the process of selection." 

At first sight this may appear to be sound reasoning, and to be ftital 
to some of the claims of the Darwinians, but further examination will 
show that it is a pure fallacy arising from the vague use of terms, and 
from comparing quite different things as if they were of the same nature. 
The fallacy depends on applying the terms of classification in system- 
atic biology to groups of single objects which have no real relation with 
the genera and species of the naturalist. The essential character of a 
species in biology is that it is a group of living organisms, sei)arated 
from all other such groups by a set of distinctive characters, having 
relations to the environment not identical with those of any other group 
of organisms, and having the power of continuously reproducing its 
like. Genera are merely assemblages of a number of these species 
which have a closer resemblance to each other in certain important and 
often prominent characters than they have to any other species. It 
will be more intelligible and more instructive if we confine ourselves to 
species as the unit of comparison with Mr. Griton's groups of stable 
finger ijatterns, in order to show the fundamental differences between 
them. And first we see that Mr. Galton classifies the marks them- 
selves, not the individuals who iDossess the marks. He tells us that the 
very same general varieties in these marks are found in English, Hin 
doos, and negroes, and, presumably in all other races; and, further, 
that he has "failed to observe any correlation between the patterns and 

' See Strand Magazine, Vol. IV. 



432 THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 

auy single personal (jiiality, whether mental or physical/' All this is 
entirely different from either specific or generic characters, whose essen- 
tial featnre is that they are found in every normal individual of the 
genus or species, and are always correlated with other characters. In 
his first paper on this subject (in 1890), Mr. Galton said lie had reason 
to believe that the patterns are to some extent hereditary, but that he 
had no evidence of it; while in his i)ai)er on " Mind," four years later, he 
could still only say that "they are to be looked upon" as having "a 
slight tendency toward transmission by inheritance," But the very 
essence of specific and generic charai'ters is that they are strictly 
transmitted by inheritance. Yet, again, whatever difference of opinion 
there may be as to the utility of all the characters which distinguish 
species, everyone will admit that many are useful, and especially that 
the general assemblage of characters that tit each species for a some- 
what different mode of life from its nearest allies, must certainly be 
useful. But the very essence of Mr. Galtou's argument as to these 
finger prints is that they are not and can not be in any way directly 
useful. How, then, can the manner in which these patterns may be 
grouped furnish us with any argument whatever as regards such totally 
diverse things as generic or specific characters, and still less as regards 
genera and species themselves? 

The fiict is, no doubt, that these patterns are the direct result of the 
laws of growth of the tissues of the skin. The limited number and 
definite character of these patterns are probably the mechanical inci- 
dental results of these laws, under the ever- varying conditions of 
development in each individual. A good analogy Mould be found in 
snow crystals, of which about a thousand varieties have been re(;orded, 
which may, however, all be grouped under hve classes, while each snow 
fall usually produces crystals of one class. Here we have the fixed aiul 
definite laws of the crystallization of water, so modified by conditions 
of moisture, temperature, motion, and perhaps electric state of the 
atmosphere, as to lead to this wonderful variety of the product, yet 
always subject to the law of crystalline symmetry and to systematic 
grouping under definite classes; just as in these finger prints we have 
a more limited variety of forms, which also can be grouped under a few 
classes. But neither the one nor the other has any real bearing upon 
the problem of the nature and origin of the genera antl species of 
living organisms. A study of the distribution of the stars over the 
surface of the heavens, or of the interlacing ripple nuirks upon the 
sea-beach, would no doubt show that these objects might also be the 
subject of classification; and from the point of view of elucidating the 
origin of species, they would be about as useful, or as worthless, as the 
study of finger marks. 

Of course, there are many varieties or races, both among animals and 
plants, which continually reappear, and which in some cases are known 
to reproduce their like, and these undoubtedly have an appearance 



THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 433 

of stability. Such are the light and dark colored varieties in many 
insects and in some nianinials and birds, the hairy or smooth varieties 
of plants, specially banded or colored land shells, and many others. 
Whenever any of these variations are not injurious under the actual 
conditions of existence of the species they may i^ersist in considerable 
numbers, and thus appear to be stable. But others which are compar- 
atively rare may be just as stable organically, as shown by the case 
of white mice, pigeons, etc., which increase to any extent under domes- 
tication. In a wild state they rever do so, and the obvious reason 
is that either the conspicuous color or something correlated with it is 
injurious. In flowers white varieties are frequent, and they occur in 
all degrees of abundance or rarity, and this indicates, in all proba- 
bility, various degrees of hurtfulness. If in any case the white color 
were not at all injurious as compared with that of the type, it would 
almost alwaj^s, by the operation of Delboeuf's law, tend to increase to 
nearly an eciuality with the parent form, and as this equality so rarely, 
occurs we must conclude that in most cases the variety, of whatever 
kind, is to some extent injurious.^ From the usually limited number 
of individuals i)resenting these discontinuous variations, we may there- 
fore draw an important conclusion which has hitherto been overlooked. 
It is that not only do such variations afford no support to the theory 
of a special "organic stability" capable of producing races, species, 
and even genera, without any aid from natural selection, but they fur- 
nish a strong, if not conclusive, argument against it, since any which 
did i)ossess such exceptional stability and were in no degree injurious 
would long since have become equal in numbers to the type of the 
species. 

A few words are here necessary as to the very common misconcep- 
tion that extreme Darwinians do not recognize the importance of the 
organism itself and of its laws of growth and development in the proc- 
ess of evolution. For myself, I may say that no one can be more 
profoundly impressed by the vast range, by the complexity, by the mys- 
tery, by the marvelous power of the laws and i)roperties of organized 

'For a statement and popular demonstration of DeTbcenf's law see Habit and 
Intelligence, by J. J. Muriihy, 2d ed., page 241. Brielly, the law is that if a species 
produces a variety, in liowever small a proportion annually, and if the variety pro- 
duces its like in the same proportion as docs the species, and if it is neither bene- 
ficial nor hurtful to the species, then the variety will increase, rapidly at first and 
more slowly afterwards, till it approaches to ecxuality in numbers with the species. 
From this law it follows that, as varieties are usually very much less numerous than 
the species, this must be due to one of the following causes: Either (1) the variety 
has but recently originated, and has not had time to increase, or (2) the variety has 
ceased to be produced by the species, or (3) it does not reproduce its like so com- 
pletely as does the species, or (4) it is disadvantageous to the species. The first two 
suppositions are improbable, and can only account for a very small proportion of the 
varieties which are greatly inferior iu numbers to the species; the other two are 
antagonistic to any si)e<ial "organic stabilitj'," which must therefore, in the great 
majority of cases, be rejected as being both unproven and opposed to the facts.

matter, wliicli constitute tbe very foundation of all life, and wliicli alone 
render possible its countless manifestations in the animal and vegeta- 
ble worlds; while those who have read Weissmann's account of the 
complex processes of development of sperm and germ cells, in his vol- 
ume on The (lerm Plasm, must feel sure that he, at all events, can have 
no inadequate conception of their importance. 

What Darwinians deny is, as I understand the question, that these 
laws themselves serve to keep the completed organism in close adapta- 
tion to the fluctuating environment, instead of merely furnishing the 
material wliich is required for that adaption. In our view, the funda- 
mental laws of growth and development, through the agency of rapid 
multiplication and constant variability, provide the material on which 
ngiiural selection acts and by means of which it is enabled to keep up. 
the adaption to the environment (which alone renders continuous life 
and reproduction possible) during the constant though slow changes, 
whether inorganic or organic, by which, in the course of ages, the 
effective environment of each species becomes more or less profoundly 
modified. Thus, and thus alone, we believe, are new species produced 
in strict adaption to the new environment. So far as rendering possi- 
ble and actually leading to growth, reproduction, and variation, the 
fundamental laws are supreme. In securing the development of new 
forms in adaption to the new environment, natural selection is supreme. 
Hence arises the real distinction — though we may not always be able 
to distinguish them — between specific and nonspecific or developmental 
characters. Tbe former are those definite though slight modifications 
through which each new species actually became adapted to its changed 
environment. They are, therefore, in their very nature useful. The 
latter are due to the laws which determine the growth and develop- 
ment of the organism, and therefore they rarely coincide exactly with 
the limits of a species. The more important of these latter characters 
are common to much larger groups, as families, orders, or classes, while 
others, depending partly on complex and fluctuating influences, are 
variable even within the limits of a species. Of this kind are the finger 
prints, which, like many other minute details of form or structure, vary 
from individual to individual. 

I have now, I think, shown that the two most recent efforts to estab 
lish new methods of organic evolution as either comijlete or partial 
substitutes for natural selection — that is, for the survival of the fittest 
among the individual variations annually produced — have completely 
failed to establish themselves as having any relation to the actual facts 
of nature. INIr. Bateson's discontinuous variations were long ago 
rejected by Darwin as having no important part in the formation of 
new species, while recent and ever-growing proofs of the generality 
and the magnitude of individual variability render these larger and 
rarer kinds of variation of even less importance than in his time. Mr. 
Galton's theory of organic stability, which is essential to the success 



THE METHOD OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 435 

of discontinuous variations, has been shown to be founded upon a com- 
parison of thin<;:s of a totally dissimilar nature, and, further, to be 
absolutely unintelligible and powerless unless in strict subordination 
to natural selection. 

The reason why two writers of such extensive knowledge and 
undoubted ability have so completely failed in dealing with the great 
l)roblem of the modification of organic forms has beeu clearly indicated 
during the course of this discussion. It has arisen from the fact that 
they have devoted themselves too exclusively to one set of factors, 
while overlooking others which are both more general and more funda- 
mental. These are the enormously rapid- multiplication of all organ- 
isms during more favorable i)eriods, and the consequent weeding out 
of all but the fittest in what must be on the whole stationary popula- 
tions. And acting in combination with this annual destruction of the 
less fit is the periodical elimination under recurrent unfavorable con- 
ditions of such a large proportion of each species as to leave only a 
small fraction — the very elect of the elect — to continue the race. It is 
only by keeping the tremendous severity of thig inevitable ami never- 
ceasing process of selection always present to our minds and applying 
it in detail to each suggested new factor in the process of evolution 
that we shall be able to determine what part such factors can take in 
the production of new species. It is because they have not done this 
that the two authors whose works have been here examined have so 
completely failed to make any real advance toward a more complete 
solution of the problem of the origin of species than has been reached 
by Darwin and his successors. 



THE PART PLAYP^D BY ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA 
OF ANIMAL LIFE.' 



P>v 1\L Ernest Solvat 



- - - Biological research must be guided iu the directiou of physics 
and cheinistry, and, in my opinion, we must set out with this profound 
conviction — that tlie phenomena of life can and should he explained soleli/ 
by the worJcing of the jjhy steal forces tchich control the material universe, 
and that among these forces electricity plays a predominant part. 

It is with a view to contribute to the verification and development of 
this thesis by observation and by study of the facts of experiment that 
I have determined to found a sj^^cial institute for research. 

I would uow address myself to all those who, in the future, and even 
after I shall have ceased to live, shall undertake researches in the 
laboratories which are about to be opened ; I would try to state the 
character of the answers which I foresee are to be looked for lYom their 
labors to the great problem, as I umlerstand it, of tlie nature of life. 
Having meditated nuich upon this i^roblem, I believe that I have found 
some new points of view which it may be useful to make known to 
those who enter upon experimental researches in this direction. I aim 
at establishiug a close correlation among the facts by tracing them back 
always to the foundation of physical principle. I introduce hypothesis 
when needful, as a lever, as a toed with which to open a new path for 
investigation. The future will show to Avhat extent my views are true, 
or how far I have been mistaken.

in every case of chemical combination, electrical energy may exist 
before thermic energy, and that the latter may be but the result of a 
transformation of the former; that, if this way of looking at the facts 
is but i>artially sustained by experiment, the reason is to be found in 
our working under conditions which cause the immediate transforma- 
tion, in whole or m part, of electricity into heat. 

In support of this mode of looking at the facts let us noti(;e that 
electricity is capable of decomposing a substance without sensibly 
raising its temperature, while this is far from being true in regard to 
heat; hence the i)roduct of an electrolysis is much greater than that 
of a dissociation due to heat alone. It follows that electricity appears 
to us as endowed with a peculiar and specific character, of which we 
shall have to take account. - - - 

II.— OF THE UELATION.S EXISTIXG BETWEEN THE PHEXOMENA OK PHY.SICS AND OK 
CHEMISTUY — UNITY OF THE THYSICAL FOIICES. 

- - - We may, it seems to me, explain all phenoaiona, both phys- 
ical and chemical, by assuming that every mass of matter (particle, 
molecule, or atom) is endowed with a specific character which is a 
mathematical function of its temperature, of its pressure, and of its 
potential energy or its electrical state.' 

Expanding this proposition, here stated in its most general form, we 
recognize that it affords us the means of explaining, not only the 
attractive force acting between the parts of matter of the same kind, 
but also and equally well the sijecial elective power which characterizes 
the chemical force called affinity; that it enables us to interpret the 
variations which this latter force exhibits under the influence of changes 
in temperature, pressure, or j^revious electrical state (dissociation, 
action in the nascent state, etc.); that in short this very function of 
which we are speaking must be the exi)ression of the physical force 
called cohesion or of the chemical force known as affinity, according as 
the substances brought together are identical or different in nature. 

All phenomena, physical and chemical, are thus blended, and fall 
into two great clas.ses: 

( 1 ) Endothermic phenomena, whi(;h consume, absorb, or render latent 
a certain quantity of external energy; and 

(2) Exothermic phenomena, which set free a part of the energy exist- 
ing in the potential state in the ingredients which unite in the forma- 
tion of a new body. 

Let us go back now to what has been said (in I) as to the i)reappear- 
ance of electrical energy in the act of chemical combination. 

If it be true that chemical and physical phenomena present no essen- 
tial points of difference, and are but the manifestations of a single and 



' Since tlie potential energy may be expressed as electrical energy. 



ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE. 439 

identical aggregate of causes, liave we not groimd for supposing, by 
reason of analogy, that iu every exothermic physical phenomenon the 
energy set free appears, or tends to ap^Dcar, first under the form of 
electricity? That if we have not hitherto succeeded iu completely 
revealing it in this form, it is because the very circumstances of our 
experiments have occasioned its transformation. 

If this conjecture be vindicated we shall be authorized to regard all 
the i^henomena of nature, whatever they may be, as manifestations of 
electricity, without deciding beforehand anything as to the essential 
nature of this force. 

This is the form under which the idea presents itself to my mind of 
the unity of the forces of nature. 

II. 

OF THE LIVING MOTOR. 

I. — OF THE NATUKK OK TllK LIVING MOTOR. 

- - - Among the essential characteristics presented by the animal 
kingdom, one of the most striking is unquestionably the faculty of 
automatic locomotion, which has been called motivity. 

The study of this distinctive quality leads us quite naturally to the 
most general consideration of the i)henomena of life in their connected 
aggregate, so that we may conveniently take this as our starting jx^int 
when we propose to unfold the part takeu by the forces of inanimate 
nature iu connection with the phenomena in question. Since motivity 
is essentially inherent in the nature of the living animal organism, we 
may say that an animal is a motor; further than this, we have good 
reason to believe that an animal is an electric motor, as I will now try 
to show. 

Proceeding by the method of exclusion, we see at the outset that 
motivity can not arise from a dynamic transformation of potential 
energy of the kind presented to us in a hydraulic motor, for we per 
ceive neither a reservoir of liquid nor a fall capable of being turned to 
account. *" 

Neither can the cause we seek be found in a purely thermic transfor- 
mation of the same kind as that exhibited by gas engines, hot-air engines, 
and steam engines, to which contrivances no one would think of com- 
paring a muscle. 

On the other hand, electricity lends itself to a satisfactory solution 
of the problem before us, a solution to which it will be well that we give 
our attention, at any rate until the future shall hav^e revealed to us the 
existence of some other as yet uuthought-of mode of transformation of 
energy, if so be that such a mode exist. 

Laying aside, then, finally, on the evidence before us, the supposition 
of hydraulic action, let us examine more closely the two other hypoth- 



440 ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE. 

eses, and let us esijecially coinpaio the yield in niucluniical energy of 
a tlierniic or electric motor with that of a living- motor. 

We know that the most highly approved thermic motors do not give 
more than about 8^ i)er cent of useful effect; the theoretic limit to the 
yield of steam engines is 17 per cent, and to that of gas engines 21 per 
cent. On the other hand, let us look back to the experiments of Iliru 
and Ilelmholtz. We find that we must assign to the yield of a muscle 
a mean value of more than 30 per cent. 

It is impossible, as wo see, to compare with this useful effect tlie far 
inferior yield of the thermic motors of human contrivance; the dilTer- 
ence is so great that, without reference to certain physical impossibil- 
ities pointed out by Ilirn, it suffices to make us give up the hypothesis 
of a thermic cause, in the sense in which we have just spoken of it. 
The idea of electrical transformation presents itself in (juite a different 
light, since in this case the yield in dynamic effect is much greater and 
is comparable to that of the living motor. 

II. — OF THE SKAT IN THE ANIMAL BODY OF KLECTKICAL MANIFESTATIONS. 
ELECTKOGENIC APPARATUS. 

- - - Oxidation of organic matter takes place in all the living cells. 
It takes place even in the blood and in the lymidi at the ex[)ense of the 
chemical constituents carried forward by these lluids and not as yet 
endowed with organized structure. All the tissues take part in this 
process of internal combustion. All must tlius co)itribute to the supply 
of energy necessary to the living being. 

But the relative importance of each of the tissues varies greatly in 
this respect. To convince ourselves of tliis we need but, for instance, 
contrast the i)hysiology of muscular tissue with that of connective 
tissue. 

The preponderant importance of the i)art played by muscular tissue 
is manifest; we know, in fact, that when work is being done the mus- 
cles come in for some 70 or 80 per cent of the total oxidation taking place 
in the animal economy. The glands, which rei)resent apparatus com- 
posed of cells of great vital activity, also undergo rapid oxidation. 
Internal oxidation is for us the source of electricity. This process goes 
on chiefly in the nuiscles and in the glands; hence we give to these 
portions of the whole organic structure the name of electrogenic 
apparatus. 

It is interesting to notice that the tissues which are the seat of most 
active oxidation, as the muscles and the glands, are richly jirovided 
with nerves, while those in whicli oxidation is feeble, as the cartilages 
and connective tissue, are but poorly sui»i)lied by the nervous system. 

May we not use this fact — a very important one, in my opinion — to 
establish an analogy between each animal organism, simple or com- 
l»lex, amaba or man, and the cell or single element of a voltaic battery"? 
Thus the readily oxidizable tissues, forming the electrogenic apparatus, 



KLECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE. 441 

would play tlie part of the uegative i)late, the fluids producing- oxida- 
tion and hydration that of the positive plate; the uerves would serve 
to close the circuit. 

We should tiius recognize in the economy of the living auimal the 
chemical duality necessary for the i)roductiou of electrical energy; 
should Ave not, consequently, be justified in considering this organism 
as a true i»liysiol()gical battery? If so, we ought to follow up the com- 
]»arison, and try to understand how this battery works; what is the 
nature and what the extent of its circuit; what are the causes which 
make its discharge to vary, and finally, wliat becomes of the energy 
which it develops. 

III. — OK THE PHYSIOLOGICAI. VOLTAIC )5ATTERY. 

In every battery the existence of available electrical energy is mani- 
fested only in so far as the electricity is able to flow off by api)roj»riato 
conductors to parts of the api>aratus where it may be utilized or 
transformed. 

In default of such an arrangement — in the case, for instance, of a bat 
tery short-circuited by means of a conductor of low resistance — we 
l)erceive nothing but a development of heat, which seems to be the 
immediate result of the transformation of energy which occurs, but 
which, in accordance with what Ave have said as to the i)reapi)earance 
of electricity, may here again be regarded as a secondary i)henomenon. 

To Justify the use of the expression physiological battery or pile, we 
have at the outset to prove that there exist in the animal organism 
lines of least electrical resistance (or behaving as such) capable of giv- 
ing direction to the electricity disengaged, of conducting and distrib- 
uting it. 

But I have good reason for believing that this part devolves upon tiie 
nerves, and that wherever they are developed and ramified they gather 
up a i)art of the electricity i)roduced by the electrogenic api)aratus and 
convey it to points Avhere it reappears unaltered or transformed. 

The slight oxidizability of nervous tissue and its great functiouaJ 
imi)ortance lend, moreover, supi)ort to this mode of looking at it. 

In what way does the propagation of electricity in the nerves take 
place! This question is certainly destined to occupy a large iflace in 
the programme for the experimental Avork of the institute. To answer 
it there Avill be need, it seems to me, for seeking first of all to complete 
our knowledge of the constitution itself of the nerve fiber, afterwards 
to study very closely the electro-physical properties of nerve tissue, to 
investigate under Avhat influences its electrical resistance Aeries, to 
determine finally the nature of the process itself by which the nerve 
current is propagated toAvard the organs where it is utilized. The 
inmost nature of this i)rocess is as yet unknown to us, and I do not 
understand that it is to be regarded as identical Avith the i>roi)agation 
of electricity in a metallic conductor. I limit myself then, for the 



442 ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE. 

present, to a single remark on this point — already proved to be true — 
namely, that manifestations of nerve action are always accompanied by 
variations of electrical condition. 

I will not enlarge further upon these questions, important as they 
are, so as not to go beyond the plan of a merely general statement of 
views. 

No one among- yon, moreover, can have overlooked the great inter- 
est of the researches of which these points will form the subject in the 
new institute. 

IV. — OF TUK PART PLAYED BY Tin': NERVES IN THE PHENOMENA OF STIMULATION. 

Muscle and nerve respond to stimulation of mechanical, thermic, 
chemical, or electrical origin, but the last of these is attended with 
especially remarkable results. 

Electrical influence is in fact by far the most powerful and extended 
in its effect, whether it be applied directly to the muscular tissue or, 
above all, if it be applied to a nerve. 

On the one hand, if a muscle be directly stimulated by a shock, a 
drop of acid, or a prick with a sharp point, we produce but a limited 
local effect, while, on the contrary, if we act through the medium of a 
nerve we call forth generalized effects, whatever be the stimulus made 
use of, and it is the whole muscle that contracts as if each of its parts 
were electritied. 

To obtain the same result without having- recourse to a nerve as 
medium it would be necessary to apply the stimulus simultaneously to 
all the elementary fibers of the muscle. 

These facts have a double bearing': they seem to justify the idea of 
attributing- to the nerves the jiart of conductors, and show also that 
electricity is the form of energy which lends itself better than any other 
to ijropagation to a distance and to distribution in the living- organism. 

v. — OF MUSCULAR CONTRACTILITY. 

Although stimulation gives rise to electrical manifestations it does not 
follow that the appearance or presence of electricity is necessarily 
dependent upon the occurrence of external stimulation. 

I am much rather inclined to believe that the physiological electric 
battery is always in a state of activity, and that a muscle works — that 
is to say, gives out energy produced by this battery — even when it 
accomplishes no external work. 

A muscle is an elastic body, more or less stretched, capable of being- 
progressively contracted by the electric current up to the point of i)ro- 
duciug an external mechanical effect. As the current diminishes the 
muscle relaxes; as the current increases it contracts, and we may say 
that its Umus, or intensity of contraction, is some function of the 
quantity of electrical energy employed. 



ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE. 443 

On the other band, it seems evident that it is in consequence not of 
a static but of a dynamic action that the muscle as an organ maintains 
its state of contraction. It behaves Hke a spring upon which a jet of 
water constantly plays, and not like a spring loaded with a weight. 

In the former of these two cases the dynamic stress, constantly ke])t 
up, is exerted against work, which involves expenditure of the moving 
tiuid and, consequently, a certain amount of energy. In the same way 
the sustained contraction of a muscle also demands a continued supply 
of energy. 

The i)hysiological battery operates, then, to furnish this energy even 
when tlte nuiscle is at rest, and as no external work is accomplished iu 
this condition all the energy furnished is transformed into heat. 

It would be easy to multiply illustrations of this condition of special 
equilibrium; we find it notably exhibited in the case of a ball sui)ported 
on a jet of water and in tliat of a soaring bird, which contends with 
the action of gravity by the rhythmic strokes of its wings. 

VI. — OF THK VAKIABILITY IN YIELD OF ENERGY BY THE AXIMAI. ORGANISM. 

It is easy to see that the quantity of energy consumed must increase 
when the state of rest is followed by that of activity from whatever 
cause, during which external and internal work are superadded to that 
of the tonus existing during nuiscular repose. The reaction of the 
organism is not constant; it varies in intensity with the condition of 
sleep, of wakefulness, and of work. - - - 

It must be, then, of absolute necessity that the yield or output of 
energy of the i)hysiological battery can regulate itself in due proportion, 
so that there shall never l^e either excess or deficiency. 

Where shall we find the seat of this regulating action if it be not in 
the nervous system itself, with the importance of which as anai)paratus 
of stimulation we have already taken note? 

Assuming that the nervous system is not the producer of energy, but 
that its function is only to distribute it, must we not hence conclude 
that by means of its stimulating power it can modify, hasten, or retard 
this distribution ? 

VII. — OF THE GENERAL REASON FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 

We may picture to ourselves simply enough, in geneial princii^le, the 
reason for the existence of the nervous system if we represent a nerve 
as the main path by which electrical energy is carried from the point 
at which it originates to a nerve center and from thence to an organ 
of exi^enditure. 

In ijroportion as we ascend in the scale of matured animal forms or 
in that of embryonic stages of development, and as we study more and 
more perfect organisms, we observe the muscular and nervous systems 
develop in extent and at tfie same time increase in the complexity of 
their structure and functions. In i)roportion as the embryo undergoes 



444 ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE. 

clevelojunent the nerve fiber elougates aud becomes the seat of increased 
electrical resistance. 

Thus the nervous network ceases to be able to carry more than a 
continually diininishinji' part of the total energy. The greater part, 
forced to undergo utilization at the seat of its i)roduction, gives to the 
muscular liber its peculiar cliaracter and brings about its contractility 
or tonicity, as we have seen (in v). - - - 

If we reHect upon the stage of progressive evolution of an inferior 
animal, or upon one of the earlier phases of development of an embryo, 
weunderstaiul that in proportion as nerve trunks take their rise in the 
neighborhood of each other differences of electric potential, existing 
between certain iioints of these trunks, tend to give rise to new trunks, 
superadded to the former, and the presence of which helps to render 
electrically dependent ni)on each other the different parts of the elec- 
trogeuic system. 

Let these anastoinoses be multiplied ad infinitum^ without losing 
sight of the fnndaniental idea of the system, and we shall bo able, as 
it seems, to succeed in explaining the governmental order which reigns 
throughout the Avhole nervons system, from the smallest sporadic gan- 
glia to the brain, which is itself the center of centers. 

VIII. — OF TIIK I'ART I'LAVKn I5V SENSOHV KXCITATIOXS. 

Let us now investigate how the nervous system may play the ])art of 
stimulator while drawing its functional energy irom the reaction of tlie 
whole organism, and how it comes to regulate the operation in all its 
variations of the physiological battery. 

Nothing seems to stand in the way of our looking on the series of 
multiplied nerve trunks which constitute the nervous system of one of 
the higher animals as closely analogous to an ordinary system of wires 
for the distribution of electrical energy, in which whole series of appa 
ratus for the consum])tion of this energy (hxmps, electric motors, et(;.) 
are branched off from a great source of production of electricity at a 
central station. 

We may assume all of these pieces of api)aratus for the utilization 
of the current to be regulated by instruments electrically connected 
with the central source of power, which instruments themselves con- 
sume in their operation a certain share of the available energy, and 
represent so many secondary derivations of energy from the system. 
Finally, to complete this ideal scheme, we may imagine each of the 
pieces of apparatus for the utilization of the current to be furnished 
with an "annunciator" — an instrument operated electrically — which 
shall give notice to the regulating apparatus of anything going wrong 
at the point at which such instrument is placed. 

The aggregate of all the regulating apparatus in such a system 
forms, to my eyes, an image of the brain, and the instruments which 
give notice of what may occur at the various outlying points in the 
system are but the analogues of the organs of sense. 



ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAE LIFE. 445 

Moreover, nothing- i)reveiits the parts of such a system being arranged 
so as to produce apparent automatism; such would be the impression 
conveyed by the innate character of the reflex actions arising- from the 
structure conferred upon the system. 

As for the sense impressions, the predominant part assigned them 
in such a distribution of energy will be to act upon the regulating- 
apparatus, and by their means to modify the conditions of output of 
energy. 

As the effect of influences from without acting' upon the organism will 
be to oppose or to favor organic activity in those parts where such 
influences have long tended to favor such activity, the organs of spe- 
cial sense will have been formed and developed, and will have become 
the normal stimulators of vital action. 

In such a system, provided the normal organism be not called upon 
for more than a part of the energy which it can produce, the actual 
production must essentially correspond with the demand for it; the 
physiological battery has, in the sensory organs, a true regulating 
apparatus capable of adjusting the amount of vital oxidation to the 
direct or indirect excitations which come from the environment; the 
whole matter appears as if the stimulations of sense impressions set 
up conditions more favorable for the genesis of energy by increasing 
nerve conductivity, perhaps by a swelling up and conseiiuent increase of 
contact or compression of the material of the axis cylinders. The flow 
of energy thus produced at the seat of excitation will necessarily be 
returne<l like an echo to the other end of the line, acting upon the mus- 
cle in whicli energy is utilized, and the increase of muscular contrac- 
tion will be the physiological exi)ression of this echo in the nuiscle of 
the signal given by the sense impression. - - - 

III. 

THE MECHANISM OF VITALITY. 

I. OF TIIK tnAIIAt;TEUISTIC.S OK VITAL ACTIVITY. 

Raving thus pictured to myself the conditions of the working of the 
ner\H)us system in a living animal, working which rs dependent upon 
the distribution of electric energy generated by i)hysicochemical reac- 
tions in the protoplasm, I have been led to examine how it is i)ossible 
to conceive of the origin of vitality in this system; that is to say, the 
origin of the reactions producing electricity in the very heart of the 
primitive protoplasm. 

Reasoning- from one inference to another, I have come to propose in 
definite form the following thesis: 

Life is essentially characterized by the existence of a system of con- 
tinuous reactions, the necessary elements of which are ceaselessly repro 
duced and which take place in th.e midst of an appro[)riate medium. 



446 ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE. 

It presents itself to us, therefore, not only in tlie complex organism, 
but even in the last result of its structural subdivision in the single 
cell, in which it still exhibits the same essential character by which it is 
sufiicieutly defined. 

It is not limited by particular morphological conditions. Organic; 
form and structure may vary almost endlessly with a condition of the 
medium without the essential character of vitality thereby disappearing. 

In order that this vital reaction may take place three general condi- 
tions are necessary: First, the simultaneous presence together of the 
prime materials essential to the reaction; secondly, a particular state 
of distribution of these prime materials, from which may result the 
heterogeneity indispensable to the progress of the reaction, and, finally, 
such arrangements as shall permit the energy liberated by the reaction 
to be consumed, utilized, or transformed, either on the spot or outside 
the field of the reaction. 

II. — <^)F OXIDATION IN THE ORGANISM. 

Among the chemical phenomena, varied as they are, which the living 
organism presents to ns there is one, that of oxidation, which is dis- 
tinguished from all the rest by its generality of extent and its prepon- 
derant importance; we may even say that, so far as the higher animals 
are concerned, oxidation is the essential chemical phenomenou of life 
and the others are but of secondary character. - - - The princi])al 
seat of vital activity is to be found in protoplasm submitted to the 
action of oxygen. It is protoplasm which forms cells; it is by it that 
they live and are nourished. As for the protoplasm itself, it derives 
its material from the various forms of food, solid, liquid, and gaseous, 
which are thus the prime source of the energy develoi)ed in the organ- 
ism. - - - But before broaching the subject of chemical change as 
it occurs in the organism let ns first consider a simjile phenomenon, and 
one with which we are familiar; we shall thus make clearer the state- 
ment which is to follow. 

When we plunge a piece of perfectly pure and homogeneous zinc into 
acidulated water, as long as the metal remains isolated in the liquid we 
observe no reaction, save that at the first moment of introduction a 
difterence of electric potential is immediately established, but all is 
limited to this. 

If, on the other hand, we connect the zinc with the acid by a sub- 
stance less oxidizable than this metal, immediately an electric current 
is set up and reaction between zinc and acid takes place. 

Simi^le contact then does not suflice to bring about reaction; it can 
but produce a sort of orientation of tension, or, if one please so to i)ut 
it, a new state of equilibrium of the particles, in which there come in 
an electro-motive ibrce and a counter electro-motive force equal and 
op])osed thereto. 



ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE. 447 

When the circuit is completed by means of a nonoxidizable or less 
oxidizable substance this equilibrium is made an end of by doing 
away with the counter electro-motive force, as a path of escape is offered 
to the electricity; but the electric flow or current thus established 
constitntes an available form of energy, which may be used to liberate 
zinc if we cause such current to act by a suitable arrangement upon an 
easily decomposable zinc salt. 

• On condition, then, that we provide by a supply of supplementary 
energy for the inevitable losses of effect resulting from these succes- 
sive operations, we see that it is possible to form a cycle of reactions 
corresponding at all points to our definition of vitality. 

If, then, this definition give a true statement of the facts, must we 
not come to recognize in the vital cycle the image of that which we 
have just sketched. - - - 

Let us consider a culture medium capable of maintaining the life of 
a given cell by furnishing it with all the constituent material it recpiires, 
and let us observe that in order to suitability of the medium for the 
cell the former must contain at least the chemical elements which occur 
as constituents of the latter. 

As long as the cell is absent this medium may be compared to the 
voltaic battery with circuit unclosed, which we have taken as an 
example by analogy. Like this latter, and by virtue of the same nat- 
ural hiws, it will present a state of equilibrium, due to the existence of 
two opposite electrical forces — a kiiul of state of virtual combination 
between the electro-positive and electro-negative constituents — but no 
chemical change will disturb its original homogeneity. 

Let us now supi)Ose that the living cell is introduced. As soon as 
equilibrium is overthrown disi)lacement8 of electricity are set up, com- 
binations and decompositions take place, and the vital circulation of 
energy and matter is established. 

To explain what has thus occurred we must assume, it seems to me, 
that the first result of the introduction of the living germ or cell has 
been to offer to the electricity conducting paths, or in other words, to 
bring about what I will call odogenesis.^ The first effect of vitality 
would seem to bo that of a contact action, allowing of cliemical change 
being energetically prodnced by favor of the short circuits ottered to 
the electrical energy engendered. 

III. — OF THE PART PLAYED BY THE LIVING CELL. 

Nevertheless, how can this take place, since the medinm we have 
under consideration continues inactive, the cell introduced reacting 
only with the stratum of this medium with which it is in immediate 
contact! 

To explain this it is essential to remark that from the quite special 
point of view at which we are just now j^lacing ourselves we must 

' Odogenesis, the creation of a jiatL, from o(Wf aiid jtvecic. 



448 ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE. 

logically think of the cell as chemically torniiiij;- a part of the medium 
by which it is surroimdecl, since it draws from thence, and continues to 
draw from thence, the materials from which it is made up. The cell, 
althougli distinct from the medium, is but a fraction of it. The chem- 
ical medium thus extends to the cell which lives in it; the latter in 
finding its way into the former has but set up a selection among the 
constituent elements. 

The fundamentally electro-positive materials go to form the substance 
of the cell itself; the oxygen, or its electro-negative equivalent, remains 
in the portion of the medium Avhicli is in intimate contact with the 
matter of the cell, whether on the outside or on the inside of the 
morphological element which it constitutes. 

Tt follows then, clearly, from this remark that the cell is, properly 
speaking, but the means of reaction presented to the medium, and, 
further, that the path for electric conduction that we are looking for 
must exist between the ceJl and the fractional part of the medium which 
is in direct relation with it. 

IV.— ON TIIK PART PLAYED BY SELECTIVE ELECTUOLYSIS IN THE PHENOMENON OF 

CELL NUTRITION. 

But before we concern ourselves with this point we ought to look into 
the phenomenon of cell nutrition and ask ourselves how it is that in 
the complex medium that surrounds it on all sides the cell is able in 
someway to choose the elementary particles which suit it; by what 
directive influence these particles take up their positions and arrange 
themselves in such a way as to become integral parts of an organized 
structure; whence finally comes the impulse which determines the 
special course of the vital circulation of matter and energy, allowing 
the cell, on the one hand, to assimilate such or such a determinate con- 
stituent from the medium, while at the same time it gives up, on the 
other hand, some constituent which has just before formed a part of its 
structure? 

It is easy to reply to these questions if we go back to the inorganic 
reaction between zinc and acid, and take it as a new subject of com- 
parison, imagining now the zinc to be in a finely divided condition. We 
have seen that in this case the acid, ready to combine with the zinc, is 
held in check by the electricity set free at the first moment of contact, 
this electricity counterbalancing or neutralizing its chemical affinity. 

We have the same state of things before us in the growing cell 
surrounded by a nutrient medium. The albuminoids of the plasma 
correspond to the finely divided zinc; the oxygen represents the acid 
of the mineral illustration. 

When this oxygen, kept in the inactive state by favor of the albumi- 
noids with which it is virtually associated, makes its way with them 
into the domain of the cell and comes in contact with albuminoid 
materials of the same kind, but more readily oxidizable for reasons 



ELECTRICITY IN THE PHENOMENA OF ANIMAL LIFE. 449 

wliicli we shall see further on, it at once enters into combination with 
them. It thus sets free new portions of albuminoid matter from the 
virtual combination which it had formed with them, and these immedi- 
ately take advantage of the electricity produced by the oxidation to 
raise their own electric potential to such a point that they may be able 
in consequence to take their places in turn in the structural edifice of 
the cell thus endothermically built up. It is in this way that, quite 
naturally, the cycle of reactions is established which constitutes the 
rotation of changes in the living machine. 

The mechanism which we have just explained shows how the chem- 
ical changes which represent the nutrition of the cell take place in the 
inmost recesses of the living substance itself, from atom to atom and 
from molecule to molecule, producing", in place and step by step with 
their occurrence, the electric energy needed for each ensuing reaction. 

Following out this order of procedure, the cell may be said to with- 
draw from the surrounding medium the nutrient materials which are 
adapted to the diflerent parts of its own substance by its proper 
affinity, which I will call selective electrolytic power, but which is 
merely the resultant of the previous electrical condition of the con- 
stituents concerned. The dro^jping- out of the one constituent neces- 
sardy incites the reeutrance of another precisely similar constituent. 
Thanks to the continuity of the rotational change going on, eacli 
particle of the cell i)asses in succession, all other things being equal, 
through the same phases of condition with that which has preceded it, 
from the moment of its admission to the substance of the cell up to 
the moment when it becomes separated from it. Before being intro- 
duced into the substance of the cell the atom must leave the virtual 
combination in which it was held. It is precisely the disappearance of 
the atom which precedes that furnishes to the one which follows it 
the exact amount of energy required to effect its selective electrolysis 
or its liberation from the state of virtual combination. Thus we shall 
have concordance, referring to the possibilities of the case, between 
what the one lacks in order to leave the medium and enter into the 
substance of the cell and that which the other provides when it frees 
itself from the combination in Avhicli it has been held in order to 
engage itself in one more powerful; and, on the whole, quantitatively 
speaking, there will be a certain available excess of energy on the 
latter side. It follows from this that the jwiuts of accretion, howsoever 
distributed as to position in the protoplasm, always retain their iden- 
tity both in composition and structure; and, as the same causes every- 
where bring about the same effects, the whole cell must reproduce 
itself indefinitely with maintenance of its identity if the nutrient 
medium remain on its part constant in character and the process of 
transformation go on. - - - 

The preceding- hasty sketch sufficiently shows, I think, that it is 
legitimate to compare, as I have done at the outset, the mechanism of

THE IXFLUEXCE OF CF.RTAIX AGENTS IX DESTROYING 
THE VITALITY OF THE TYPHOID AND OF THE COLON 
BACILLUS. 1 



By John S. Billings and Adelaide "Ward Peckham. 



During' tlie last year a series of researches upon the influence of light, 
of desiccation, and of the i^roducts of certain micro-organisms upon the 
vitality of some cf the pathogenic bacteria has been carried on in the 
laboratory of hygiene of the University of Pennsylvania by Dr. Adelaide 
AV. Peekhani, in accordance with a general scheme for such investiga- 
tion prepared by Dr. S. Weir Mitchell and Dr. Billings, the director of 
the laboratory, and with the aid of a grant from the Bache fund. 

That direct sunlight kills or stops the growth of certain bacteria has 
been known since 1877, when Dowiies and Blunt presented to the 
Boyal Society a report on "Researches on the effect of light upon bac- 
teria and other organisms."^ Since that date a number of papers on 
this subject have been published, the most important one in relation to 
the typhoid bacillus being that of Janowski in 1890.^ The first series of 
exi)eriments by Dr. Peckham was made with the staphylococcus pyo- 
genes aureus, the object being mainly to determine the best methods of 
investigation. 

Photobacteriographs were made by Buchner's method, namely, by 
placing a square of black paper, or of glass of different colors, upon 
the bottom of a plate containing inoculated agar-agar during insola- 
tion ; but although the protected portion was visible after fifteen min- 
utes' insolation and incubation for twenty-four hours, and sharply 
defined after two hours' insolation and incubation as before, no accu- 
rate estimate could be made of the difference in the destructive power 
of difterent periods of insolation. Successful photobacteriography 
re(iuires inoculation of large quantities of bacteria, in order that the 
colonies may be set so closely together that a ground-glass appearance

is produced, in which case countiug" of the colonies is pisictically 
iiiil>ossible. 

For this reason the followiuj;' method was used for each of the three 
orgauisins, the staphylococcus pyo.uenes aureus, the bacillus coli coui- 
munis, and the bacillus typhi abdominalis. 

To obtain an accurate measure of the effects produced by lights of 
different intensity or of different colors, it is necessary to insure, as far 
as possible, that the bacteria to be experimented on shall be uniforndy 
distributed in the culture media. Tubes containing each 10 c. c. of 
bouillon were inoculated with one drop of a bouillon culture and tJjen 
placed in an incubator for twenty-four hours. A small quantity of 
sterilized gravel was then added to the culture tube and it was thor- 
oughly shaken, after which 10 c. c. of a one-half per cent salt solution 
was added and the culture drawn into a Nuttall's dropping apparatus. 
From this one-twentieth of 1 c. c. of the bouillon culture was dropped into 
a tube of melted agar-agar, which was slowly and thoroughly agitated, 
and the contents were then pouied into a l*etri dish, carefully leveled 
on a leveling tripod over ice water. In the first method used the Petii 
dishes were found to be so uneven on the bottom that the layer of 
medium under the protective square was often very thick or very thin 
as comi)ared with that about the circumference of the plate, and there- 
fore c()ini>arisons made between the center and the circumference would 
be in almost every case unreliable. To overcome this difticuUy Just 
one-half of the plate was shaded with black paper or colored glass. 

The plates were then exposed to sunlight bottom upward, so as to 
allow the sun to shine as directly as possible on the inoculated agar- 
agar. At intervals of fifteen minutes a plate was removed and placed 
in the incubator. The temperature of the plates during insolation was 
always below ;U^ C, as shown by a thermometer with a blackened 
bulb which was placed in the sun and the temperature noted every 
fifteen minutes. Sunny, still days were utilized for insolation, begin- 
ning at 10 a, m., during the months of October, November, and Decem- 
ber. After insolation the plates, and also a noninsolated control plate, 
were incubated for twenty-four hours. 

The colonies were counted in the following manner: A Xo. 1 eye- 
piece was divided into fields (as done by ISTuttall in counting tubercle 
bacilli) by introducing a disk of black cardboard which had a square 
opening divided into four parts by two hairs placed at right angles. 
This eyei)iece and an objective of low power were used in counting. 
The percentage of germs destroyed by insolation was estimated from 
the mean of four counts taken on both the insolated and the protected 
halves of the plate. By this method an accurate statement can be 
made regarding the difference in protective power given by the differ- 
ent colors, not from simple observation, but by comparison of a definite 
number of colonies counted.

From this series of experiments the following results were obtained: 

Insolation for fifteen minutes destroys to a slight extent each of the 
three organisms experimented upon. Two hours' insolation destroys 
08 per cent of the germs and from three to six hours kills all. The 
colon bacillus is more easily destroyed by insolation than is the typhoid 
bacillus. Exposure to diffuse daylight, to gaslight, or to the incandes- 
cent electric light produces little effect. Eed, orange, yellow, and green 
light produce little effect during two hours insolation; while the blue 
and violet rays kill nearly as rapidly and as certainly as full sunlight. 
Insolation from six to eight hours lessens the number of colonies under 
the protective square to a slight extent, for the colors red, orange, 
yellow, and green. 

Plates were made in the same manner and exposed to diffused light 
for periods varying from fifteen minutes to two days. The exposure 
was made on clear sunny days in the light part of a room. In this 
experiment the result was negative, the number of colonies on the two 
sides of the plate being approximately the same. 

An ordinary gas-burner and an incandescent light were each used as 
the source of illumination. The i)lates were jilaced bottom ui)ward in 
a dark room near the light used. Illumination for sixteen hours with 
gas produced no effect on the growth of the organism as shown by 
counting of the colonies. 

Illumination for four and one-half hours with an incandescent light 
also gave negative results. 

A series of experiments was made with tubes of bouillon inoculated 
with tlie different organisms and then inclosed in larger tubes contain- 
ing tluids of different colors — red, orange, yellow, and blue — which were 
exi)osed to sunlight with control tubes, one placed in water and the 



454 DESTRUCTION OF TYPHOID AND COLON BACILLUS. 

otlier iu a similar tube covered with black paper. The materials used 
for making the colored solutious were corallin, chromate and bichro- 
mate of potassium, and methylene blue. From these tubes plates were 
made, and the number of colonies counted. 

It was found that an increase in the number of colonies continued to 
the eighteenth day, tbe number being greater in the colon and aureus 
cultures than in the tyi)hoid. The colonies then began to decrease, and 
on the tifty-eighth day tbe plates contained but few colonies. In tliis 
experiment, as in the last, plates made from culture tubes i)]aced iu 
blue fluid showed fewer colonies. 

Since the presentation of the above results, with details, charts, and 
tables, to the National Academy, in April, 1894, Dr. Dieudonne has 
published, in the Arbeiteu aus dem Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamte, a 
paper on the effects of sunlight on bacteria, in Avhich he reports results 
substantially the same, and obtained by almost the same methods as 
those of Dr. Peckham. 

Sunlight not only weakens or kills the typhoid and the colon bacillus, 
but it aftects culture media so as to render them less capable of sup- 
porting the growth of these organisms. Dr. Peckham found that 
sterile bouillon insolated from one to ten days and then inoculated with 
the bacilbis typhi abdominalis showed no diminution in the number of 
colonies as comi)ared with a control plate made from a similar culture 
not so exposed. Twenty days insolation and then inoculation with the 
typhoid bacillus showed great, decrease in the numbc^r of colonies on 
all the i^latesj some of them were sterile. Insolation of forty days, 
and inoculation in the same manner, gave very few colonies for each 
plate, probably the same as the number of germs introduced — i. e., there 
had been no development. Bouillon insolated fifty to sixty days and 
inoculated gave sterile tubes. This insolated bouillon after inoculation 
and incubation remained perfectly clear, and plates made after a week 
of incnbation gave no more colonies than those made at the end of 
twenty-four hours. Its reaction was alkaline, but not intensely so. 

Insolated agar-agar. — Of twenty-three tubes of agar-agar insolated 
twenty days and then inoculated with the bacillus typhi abdominalis, 
all except one remained sterile, and neither the bacillus typhi al)dom- 
inalisnor the bacillus coli communis grew when inoculated in stripes on 
these i)lates. Of seven tubes of agar-agar insolated forty days and 
then inoculated with the bacillus of typhoid, all remained sterile. On 
fomr of these plates mold appeared after some days. Of seven tubes 
of agar-agar insolated forty days and then inoculated and incubated as 
before, all remained sterile. 

Insolated gelatin. — Of ten gelatin tubes insolated forty days and then 
inoculated with the bacillus typhi abdominalis, six remained sterile, two 
contained a few colonies of bacillus typhi abdominalis, and two were 
contaminated. 



DESTRUCTION OF TYPHOID AND COLON BACILLUS. 455 

The insolated bonilloii was tlieu kept in dift'use dayliglit for forty 
days and again inoculated with the typhoid bacilhis. Within twenty- 
four hours the tubes of bouillon became turbid and plates made from 
them showed innumerable colonies. 

It is difficult to account for the eftect of insolation on culture media. 
Roux in his experiments on anthrax found that insolation of bouillon 
for two or three hours rendered it unsuitable for germination of the 
spores, but if the bacilli were introduced they would thrive. He attrib- 
utes this alteration to some chemical change which the culture media 
undergo during the insolation. lie found also that if the insolated 
media were kept in the dark or in diffuse daylight for a time, the orig- 
inal nutritive qualities were restored and germination of spores would 
rake place. Geisler and Janowski observed the bactericidal properties 
of insolated media, but the latter could lind no chemical alteration in 
such media. 

Percy Frankland in his chapter on action of light on micro-organisms^ 
concludes from the results obtained by many investigators "that the 
effect is due to a process of oxidation jtossibly brought about through 
the agency of ozone or peroxide of hydrogen, or both; that all appar- 
ently direct low temperature oxidations require the presence of water. 
And inasnuTch as the bactericidal action of light is unquestionably a 
case of low temperature oxidation, there is the strongest presumptive 
evidence, as well as weighty experimental evidence, that moisture, 
which practically means the possibility of the presence of peroxide of 
hydrogen, or of some similar material, is essential for its manifesta- 
tion."^ Westbrook^ found that old broth cultures of the tetanus bacil- 
lus iu an atmosphere of hydrogen were not in the least affected by 
exposure to sunlight, either in regard to their virulence or their raj^id- 
ity of growth on reinoculation. 

When the same culture was sealed up iu the presence of air the 
micro-organisms were not only killed, but the material was completely 
harndess when inoculated into white mice. It was however, possible 
to obtain vigorous and virulent growths from cultures which had been 
made quite innocuous by the action of the sun. Oxygen was used up 
in the process. Under ordinary circumstances one might be tempted 
to explain the effect of sunlight in destroying bacteria by the drying of 
the organisms exposed to it. especially in the case of those bacteria 
which do not form spores, but our experiments show that desiccation 

'Micro-organisms in water, page 890. 

^Gelatin, to which were added different amounts of the peroxide of hydrogen, was 
inoculated with the bacillus typhi abdominalis and poured into plates. Those 
plates iu which more than one part of the peroxide to 5,000 of gelatin was used 
were sterile.

for months lias little effect on the vitality of the typhoid or of the 
colon bacillus. To determine the influence of desiccation upon these 
organisms, and also upon the stai)hylococcus aureus, the following 
exi)eriments were made : 

Bouillon cultures of the bacillus typhi abdominalis, the bacillus coli 
communis, and the stai^hylococcus aureus were roughly dried on threads 
1 cm. long and then desiccated, a i)ortion being i)laced in a vacuum, 
another portion in a desiccator over sulphuric acid, and a third in a 
closet; all were kept in the dark. The result of the desiccation under 
the three ditferent conditions is as follows: 

Bacillus typM abdominalis. — Lived in a vacuum from December 30 
until July 24, or 207 days; in a desiccator over suljjliuric acid from 
January 3 until July 24, or 213 days; in a closet from December 18 
until July 24, or 22D days. 

Bacillus coli co7)imH)iis. — Lived in a vacuum from November 29 until 
May 30, or 183 days; in a desiccator over sulphuric acid from January 
3 until July 24, or 213 days; in a closet from December 30 until May 30, 
or 152 days. 

Staphylococcus aureus. — Lived in a vacuum from ISTovember 29 until 
July 24, or 207 days; in a desiccator over sulphuric acid from October 
25 until April 19, or 178 days; in a closet from February 13 until 
July 24, or 102 days. 

It will be seen from these experiments that the organisms experi- 
mented on endure desiccation for live months, or more, without losing 
their vitality, and hence the slight evaporation which may have 
occurred in the insolation exjDeriments had probably no influence on 
the results. 

It is evident that sunshine must exercise considerable influence in 
destroying bacteria on the surface of soil, streets, etc., exposed to its 
influence, but its action is almost contined to the surface, as a[>pears 
from the results obtained by Esmarch in attempts to disinfect bedding 
and clothing by this agency. While the light from an incandescent 
electric lamp has little germicidal effect, that from a powerful arc lamp 
produces effects similar to those of sunlight, and it has been proposed 
to use this means to disinfect the walls of infected rooms. The bacillus 
of tuberculosis appears to be more quickly destroyed by light than the 
typhoid or the colon bacillus, being killed by exposure to simple difliised 
daylight in about a week,' and this ftict should be borne in mind in 
advising measures to x)revent the diffusion of this organism. 

The investigations upon the typhoid and the colon bacilli referred 
to in this paper were undertaken as part of a general scheme of inquiry 
to ascertain the agencies which tend to destroy the typhoid bacillus 
when it is introduced into a source of water supply, as, for example, 
into a running stream. An imi)ortant part of this investigation relates

to tlie iiitiuence of tlie common water bacteria or of their products 
ii])Oii the vitalit}^ of the typhoid bacilhis. 

A research rehitiiig to the iuiiuence of the common water bacteria or 
of their products upon the vitality of the typhoid and colon bacilli was 
then undertaken. Three series of experiments were made, the lirst to 
ascertain whether the typhoid and colon bacilli would grow on media 
containing the products of growth of the water bacteria; the second to 
verify tlie first, to meet any objection that might be raised as to the 
sterilizatiou by heat of the medium in which the water organisms had 
grown, as the opinion has been advanced that some products of the 
activity of bacteria are either volatile or rendered inert by high tem- 
peratures. The third experiment was made to find whether the two 
organisms would grow with the water bacteria. These series of experi- 
ments were conducted in the following manner: 

(1) Forty-four varieties of bacteria obtained from the water of the 
Schuylkill lliver were used in the first exi)eriiiieiit. A pure culture of 
each organism was inoculated upon slanted tubes of agar-agar and 
allowed to attain a luxuriant growth. The tubes were then thoroughly 
sterilized in the steam sterilizer, the reaction was taken, and the 
medium was again slanted. A set of these tubes was then inoculated 
with the bacillus typhi abdomiiialis, and a second set with the bacillus 
coli communis. As a result of this research it was found that the 
typhoid and colon bacilli grew upon these tubes in every instance, the 
growths varying in thriftiness from luxuriant ones on some tubes to 
transparent films on others. 

(2) In the second series which w^ere made to verify the first^ — that is, 
to find whether the products of the activity of water bacteria in the 
medium used would retard or prevent the growth of the tyi)hoid and 
colon bacilli — the water bacteria were inoculated into Erlenmeyer fiasks 
of bouillon, each containing 70 c. c, and placed in the incubator. After 
being incubated from fifteen to twenty days the cultures were filtered 
through i)orcelain, the reaction was taken, and the filtrate was run into 
sterilized tubes. Two sets were made as before and inoculated with 
the typhoid and the colon bacilli, respectively. These tubes were then 
incubated for twenty-four hours, and from them gelatin tubes were 
inoculated and poured into Petri plates. In each of these inoculated 
filtrates the two organisms grew in a characteristic manner and multi- 
plied for at least four days. 

(3) In the third experiment thirty-nine varieties of the water bacteria 
were inoculated into tubes, each containing 10 c. c, of sterilized tap 
water and o drops of sterilized bouillon. Two sets of tubes were made 
as before, and each set inoculated with one of the organisms which was 
being tested, and each tube contained a different variety of water bac- 
teria. From these tubes gelatin j)lates were made each day for more 
than twelve days. Both bacilli gave characteristic colonies with each of 
the water organisms except tw^o, which had apparently an antagonistic

The typhoid bacillus in several instances outlived its associate crgauism.

MODERI^ DEVELOPMENTS OF HARVEY'S WORK IN THE 
TREATMENT OF DISEASES OF THE HEART AND CIRCU- 
LATION.i 



By Dr. T. Lauder Brunton, F. R. S. 



This annual meeting in memory of Harvey is usually associated with 
feelings of pleasure and. happiness, for it was intended by its immortal 
founder to commemorate the benefactors of the college and to encourage 
good fellowship among us. 

Such commemoration of those who have benefited the college in the 
past, although it necessarily recalls many who have passed away, is, 
notwithstanding, on ordinary occasions, ])leasant instead of painful, 
because the feeliug of loss through then- death is completely over- 
powered by the lecollection of the good they have done m their lifetime. 
To-day the case is very different, for the first thought that nuist needs 
occur to everyone present here is that on this occasion last year our 
late jjresident showed for the first time what seemed to be imperfect 
fulfillment of his duty to the college by being late in his attendance at 
the meeting. Perhaps nothing else could have shown more clearly his 
deep concern for the welfare of the college and his thorough devotion 
of every faculty of mind and body to its interests than the fact that 
no duty, no pleasure, and no press of occupation could tempt him to 
leave one iota of his work in the college undone. The only thing that 
did keep him back was the hand of death, which, although at the last 
meeting he and we knew it not, was already laid upon him. Tliough 
his death was less hapi)y than that of the great Harvey, inasmuch as 
he lingered on for days instead of hours after he was first struck down, 
yet their deaths were alike in this respect that, up to the time of the 
fatal attack, each was in the full possession of his faculties, each was 
in the enjoyment of his life. Like Radclifte and Mead, like Ilalford 
and Baillie, and like many other distinguished fellows of this college, 
the greatness of Clark is to be estimated not by the i)ublished works 
which he has left behind but by the infiuence he exerted on his con-

tenii)oiaiies. For the very estimation in which his professional skill 
was held led to his whole time being taken up in giving advice and 
prevented him from having the leisure to work out or record the results 
of the patliological and clinical observations which both his youtlifiil 
publications and his later career showed him to be specially iitted to 
make. I might say very much more about him, but it has already been 
said much better than I could possibly do it by yourself, Mr. President, 
ill your annual address and in the eloquent and heart stirring words 
which you addressed to the college on the occasion of your taking the 
presidential chair rendered vacant by tlie death of Sir Andrew Clark. 

IJnt while we were saddened to-day by the death of our late presi- 
dent we lio[)e to be gladdened by the presence among us again of one 
whom we all reverence not only as a former president of this college, 
but as one of the greatest leaders of clinical medicine in this century, 
Sir William Jenner. Like Harvey, Sir William Jenner is honored by 
his college, by his country, by his sovereign, and by the world at 
large. In times of trial and danger the lives of the royal children 
were committed to the keeping of Harvey by his king, and to day the 
care not only of her own life but of that of her nearest and dearest is 
committed to Sir W^illiam Jenner by his sovereign in the full and well- 
grounded assurance that in no other hands could they be more safe. 
The great clinician. Graves, wished to have as his epitaph, "He fed 
fevers;" but Jenner has advanced much beyond Graves, and by show- 
ing us how to feed the different kinds of fevers has saved thousands 
of valuable lives. To-day this college is acknowledging his right to 
rank with Sydenham, Heberden, Bright, and Garrod by bestowing 
upon him the Moxoii medal for clinical research. In numbering Sir 
W^illiam among its medalists the college honors itself as well as him, 
and in acknowledging the great services he has rendered, it is, on this 
occasion, acting as the mouthpiece of the medical profession not only 
in this country, but in the world at large. 

It was with tluMvish to keep green the memory of the benefactors of 
the college that this oration was instituted by Harvey, and not at all with 
the intention that it should be devoted to his own praise. Hut Harvey 
stands out so high above all others that it is only natural that in the 
numerous orations which have been yearly given before the College of 
Physicians, the subject-matter should have been to a great extent con- 
lined to a consideration of Harvey and his works. On looking over 
many of these orations I find that everything I could say about Har- 
\ey — his person, his circumstances, his character, and his works — has 
already been said so fully and eloquently that I could not add to it any- 
thing further, nor could I hope to express it even so well. I purpose, 
therefore, to consider to-day some of the modern developments of Har- 
vey's work, more especially in relation to the treatment of diseases of 
the heart and circulaticm. There is, I think, a certain advantage in 
this also, inasmuch as one is apt by considering Harvey's work only as

he left it to overlook the enormous extent to which it no\7 influences 
our thoughts and actions, and thus to comjirehend its value very 
imi)erfectly. 

As he himself says, " From a small seed springs a mighty tree; from 
the minute gemn)ule or apex of the acorn, how wide does the giuirled 
oak at length extend his arms, how loftily does he lift his branches to 
the sky, how deeply do his roots strike down into the ground ! " ' 

How very minute is the gemmule from which has sprung everything 
that is definite in medical science, for this gemmule is no other than the 
idea which Uarvey records in these simple words, " I began to think 
whether there might not be motion, as it were, in a circle." 

Out of this idea has grown all our knowledge of the processes of 
human life in health and disease, of the signs and symptoms which 
indicate disease, of the mode of ax^tion of the drugs and api)liances 
which we use and the proper means of omi)loying them in the cure of 
disease. In the works that have come dosvn to us we find that Harvey 
developed his idea physiologically in several directions. lie discussed 
its application to the absorption and distribution of nourishment 
through the body, the mixing of blood from various parts, the main- 
tenance and distribution of animal heat, and excretion through the 
kidneys. How far he developed it in the direction of pathology and 
therapeutics we do not know, as the results of his labors on these sub- 
jects have, unfortunately, been lost to us by the destruction of his 
manuscripts during the civil war. 

We are proud to reckon Harvey as an Englishman by birth, but he 
is far too great to belong exclusively to any country; men of various 
nations and scattered all over the face of the earth acknowledge him as 
their teacher, and have played, or are playing, a part in developing his 
discovery in its various branches of physiology, pathology, pharma- 
cology, semeiology, and therapeutics. Americans, Austrians, Danes, 
Dutchmen, Frenchmen, Germans, Italians, Norwegians, Russians, and 
Swedes have all shared in the work, and so numerous are they that it 
would be impossible for me to name them all. Stephen Hales, how- 
ever, deserves si)ecial mention, for he was the first to measure the pres- 
sure of blood in the arteries, and the resistance offered to the circula- 
tion of the blood by the capillaries was investigated by Thomas Young, 
a fellow of this college, who ranks with Harvey, Newton, and Darwin 
as one of the greatest scientific men that England has ever produced, 
and whose undulatory theory has been as fertile of results in physics 
as Harvey's idea of circulation has been in physiology and medicine. 

Harvey's desire that those who had done good work should not be 
forgotten was founded upon his knowledge of mankind, and of the tend- 
ency there is to forget what has already been done by those who have 
gone before us. The opposite condition often prevails, and the past is 
glorified at the expense of the present. But sometimes the present is

462 MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OF HARVEY's WORK. 

wrongly glorified at the exx)eiise of the past, and past Avork or past 
benefits are forgotten. 

Clood exaiiii)les of tliis are atforded by physiological views regarding 
the action of the vena cava and i)nlmonary veins and the causation of 
the cardiac sounds. Harvey appears to have thought that the vena 
cava and pulmonary veins were simply dilated i)assively by the pas- 
sage of blood into them; but the fact that they possess a power of inde- 
])endent pulsation was known to Haller/and was brought prominently 
forward by Senac,'^ who regards the vena cava as the starting point of 
the whole circidation. He says: "The vena cava is therefore the first 
motor cause which dilates. the cavities of the heart; it tills the auricles, 
and extends their walls in every direction." 

These observations appear to have been almost forgotten uutil they 
Avere again made independently a few years ago,^ and in one of the 
latest and most accurate physiological treatises which now exist the , 
description of the cardiac cycle is nearly the same as that given by 
Senac. "A complete beat of the whole heart, or cardiac cycle, may be 
observed to take place as follows: 

" The great veins, inferior and superior vente caviX", and pulmonary 
veins are seen, while full of blood, to contract in the neighborliood of 
the heart; the contraction runs in a ])eristaltic wave toward the auri- 
cles, increasing m intensity as it goes."^ 

The pulsation of these veins, however, can not be a constant phe- 
nomenon, or it would have been noticed by such a keen observer as 
Harvey. 

The sounds of the heart were discovered by Harvey, or at least Avere 
known to hiin, for he speaks of the sound caused in the esophagus of 
the horse by drinking, and says: "In the same way it is with each 
motion of the heart, when there is a delivery of blood from the veins 
to the arteries, that a i)ulse takes place and can be heard within the 
chest." This observation remained, as far as we know, without any 
farther development until the time of Laeunec, who introduced the 
practice of auscultation; but it was a fellow of this college. Dr. Wol- 
lastoii,'' who first discovered that the muscles daring contraction giv^e 
out a sound; and although many observations were made regarding 
cardiac murmars by Corrigan, Bouillaud, and Piorry, it was chielly by 
fellows of this college, Dr. Clendinning, Dr. C. J. !>. Williams, and Dr. 
Todd, that the cjuestion was finally settled, and the conclusions at which 
they arrived are those now accepted as correct, viz, that "the first or 
systolic sound is essentially caused by the sudden and forcible tight- 
ening of the muscular fibers of the ventricle when they contract; and 
that the second sound Avhich accompanies the diastole of the ventricle

depends solely on the reaction of the arterial columns of blood in the 
semilunar valves at the arterial orifices."^ 

• Yet in recent discussions re.ii'ardin-i' the origin of cardiac sounds little 
mention has been made of the work of this committee; and, indeed, I 
first learned of the value of the work from a German source, Wagner's 
Ilandwih^terbuch der Physiologie. 

The importance of these observations in the diagnosis of heart dis- 
ease it would be hard to overestimate, But diagnosis alone is not the 
aim of the physician, whose object must be to prevent, to cure, or to 
control disease. A knowledge of physiology may greatly help us to 
prevent disease, not only of the heart and vessels, but of every member 
of the body. The control and cure of disease may also be effected by 
diet and regimen, but it is undoubtedly in many cases greatly assisted 
by the use of drugs, and is sometimes impossible without them. Har- 
vey knew that drugs applied externally are absorbed and act on the 
body,^ so that colocyntli thus applied will purge and canthnrides will 
excite the urine; but the action of drugs when injected into the blood 
appears to have been tried first by Christopher Wren, better known as 
the architect of St. Paul's than as a pharmacolog'ist. According- to 
Bishop Si)ratt, "He was the first author of the noble anatomical experi- 
ment of injecting liqours into the veins of animals, an experiment now 
vulgarly known, but long since exhibited to tlie meetings at Oxford, 
and thence carried by some Germans and published abroad. I>y this 
operation divers creatures were immediately purged, vomited, intoxi- 
cated, killed, or revived, according to the quality of the liquor injected. 
Hence arose many new experiments, and chiefly that of transfusing 
blood, which the society has i^rosecuted in sundry instances, that will 
lu'obably end in extraordinary success."^ 

The method originated by Wren, of injecting drugs into the circula- 
tion, was skillfully utilized by Magendie for the purpose of localizing 
the particular part of the body upon which the drugs exerted their 
action, and he thus conclusively proved that the symptoms produced 
by strychnine were due to its effect on the spinal cord. His experi- 
ments showed that the rate of absorption from various parts of the 
body varied enormously, and, through the teaching of Christison, led 
to the introduction into i)ractice by Dr. Alexander Wood of that most 
useful aid to modern therapeutics, the hypodermic syringe. 

The first quantitative experiments on the effect of drugs upon the 
circulation were made, to the best of my knowledge, by James Blake, 
in 1844, in the laboratory of University College, at the suggestion of 
the late Professor Sharpey, with the hemadynainometer of Poiseuille, 
which had then been recently introduced.

Ill speaking about the work of Blake and Sliarpey, who are both 
dead, one requires to use the greatest care not to unduly detract from 
the merit of one by ascribing more to the other; but those who knew 
Professor Sharpey's enormous range of knowledge, his readiness toi)ut 
it all at the disposal of others, and the influence he exerted upon all 
who came in contact with him, as well as his unseltishiiess in making 
no claim whatever to* what was justly his due, will at once recognize 
now greatly Blake was indebted to iSharpey. More especially is this 
the case when we consider that, althongh the credit for the observa- 
tions themselves belongs to Blake, yet after the im})etus which Sharpey 
gave him had passed away, he did very little more during the course 
of a long life. It seems all the more necessary to commemorate Sharjiey 
on this occasion, because he has left coini)aratively few writings behind 
him, and anyone who should judge by them alone of his iniluence ui)on 
physiological progress in this country would grievously underestimate 
it; for Sharpey was above all a teacher, and his work was written not 
with pen and ink on paper or parchment, but was engraved upon the 
hearts and minds of his pupils and friends. Upon two of these, espe- 
cially, has Sharpey's mantle fallen, and to Burdon-Sanderson and ^lichael 
Foster we owe a revival of experimental i)hysio]ogy in this country, a 
revival of the method which Harvey not only used in making Ids great 
discovery, but also employed to demonstrate the truth of it to the rulers 
of this land. By their writings, by their lectures, by their original 
experiments, by their demonstrations, and by the i)ui)ils they have 
trained, Burdon-Sanderson and jMichael Foster, under the aus])ices of 
Acland and Ilumj^hrey, have ditl'used among the medical men of this 
country a knowledge of physiology so extensive and exact as could 
only be found before their time among those who had made a special 
study of the subject. Yet more than to them, more than to anyone 
else since the time of Harvey, do we owe our present knowledge of the 
circulation to Carl Ludwig. He it is who first enabled the i)ressure of 
blood in the arteries to record its own variations automatically, so that 
alterations could be noticed and measured which were too rapid or too 
slight to be detected by the eye. To him also we owe the plan of arti- 
ficial circulation, by which the changes in the functions of the organs 
and in the vessels which supply them can be observed quite apart from 
the heart, lungs, or from the nervous system. 

Like Sharpey, Ludwig is a great teacher, and like the great architects 
of the Middle Ages, who built the wonderful cathedrals which all 
admire, and the builder of which no man knows, Ludwig has been con- 
tent to sink his own name in his anxiety for the progress of his work 
iind in his desire to aid his pui)ils. The researches which have a^jpeared 
under these pupils' names have been in many instances, perhaps in most, 
not only suggested by Ludwig, but carried out experimentally with his 
own hands, and the paper which recorded the results finally written by 
himself Jn the papers which have appeared under his pupils' names we 
find their obligations to the master re(\orded in such terms as "unter

Mitwirkuug." But no one except those wlio have worked with hiin can 
understaud what such cooperation meant. 

The graphic method uitroduced by Ludwig for the purpose of measur- 
ing the bkiod pressure was adapted by Yolkmaun to the registration of 
the pulse in man, and the same method has been moditied and rendered 
more easily applicable at the bedside by Marey and Chauveau, to whom 
we chiefly owe our knowledge of the modifications in the form of the 
;il)ex beat and of the pnlse curve. It is to Ludwig and his scholars, 
liowever, that we owe the greater part of onr knowledge of the mechan- 
ism of the circulation and of the varying distribution of the blood in 
varions parts of the body. 

The effect of emotion upon tlie heart was carefully noted by Harvey, 
who says: ''For every affection of the mind which is attended with 
pain or pleasure, hope or fear is the cause of an agitation whose influ- 
ence extends to the heart." ^ 

-Not only was Harvey well acquainted with the fact that the beats of 
the heart vary very mucli in strength and force, but he also knew that 
the circulation in various parts of the body may be very different at 
one and the same time. He says: 

"It is manifest that the blood in its course does not everywhere pass 
with the same celerity, neither with the same force in all places and at 
all times, but that it varies greatly according to age, sex, temperament, 
hal)it of body, and other contingent circumstances, external as well as 
internal, natural or nonnatural. For it doea not course through intri- 
cate and obstructed passages with the same readiness that it does 
through straight, unimpeded, and pervious channels. Neither does it 
run through close, hard, and crowded parts with the same velocity as 
through spongy, soft, and permeable tissues. Neither does it flow and 
penetrate with such swiftness when the impulse (of the heart) is slow 
and weak, as when this is forcible and frequent, in which case the blood 
is driven onwards with vigor and in large quantity. 

"And what, indeed, is more deserving of attention than the fact that 
in almost every affection, appetite, hope, or fear, our body suffers, the 
countenance changes, and the blood appears to course hither and 
thither? In anger, the eyes are fiery and the pupils contracted; in 
modesty, the cheeks are suffused with blushes; in fear and under a 
sense of infamy and of shame, the face is pale, but the ears burn as if 
for the evil they heard or were to hear; in lust, how quickly is the 
member distended with blood and erected." - 

Harvey's great contemi)orary, Milton, though so violently opposed to 
him in politics, would certainly not remain in ignorance of Harvey's 
work, and he has noted the changes in the color of the face produced 
by emotions. In describing the behavior of Satan on his journey from 
hell to Paradise, he says: 

Thus while be spake, each passion dimm'd his face, 
Thrice changed with pale — ire, envy, and despair. 
Which marr'd his borrow'd visage.'

But altli()uj;li these facts were known to ITarvey so long ago, it is 
only in comparatively recent years that the niechauisin by wliich they 
are brought about has beeu investigated, and it is only within the last 
decade that i^hysiologists have begun regularly to believe that the 
cardiac muscle has ii power of rhythmic pulsation independent of its 
nerves, although Harvey had noted that when the heart was cut into 
small pieces the fragments would still continue to pulsate. We may 
fairly, indeed, compare the movements of the heart, as regarded by 
physiologists of the present day, to those of a horse, which is capable 
of going independently, although its i)ace may be slowed (u- accelerated 
by the reins or spur of the rider. The power of the vagus to act as a 
rein to the heart, and slow its movements or stop them altogether, was 
first noted by Edward and Ernest lleinrich Weber, while the effect 
that it sometimes has of accelerating instead of slowing, like the effect 
of shaking the reins of the horse, was observed by Schitt', Moleschott, 
and Lister. 

The accelerating nerves of the heart, and the position of the nerve 
center from which they spring, were more thoroughly investigated by 
von Bezold,^ Avhile the power of the vagus to weaken as mcII as slow the 
heart Avas observed by Gaskell. The position of the cardiac center, 
which, like the rider, regulates the movements of the heart, was located 
in the medulla oblongata chiefly by Ludwig and his scholars. Like the 
heart, the vessels also are regulated in diameter by the nervous system 
in accordance with the wants of the body generally; and the eflect 
upon the vasomotor uerv^es, which when cut allow them to dilate and 
when stimulated cause them to contract, was discovered by Bernard, 
Brown-Sequard, and by our countryman, Waller; Avhile the power of 
other nerves to cause immediate dilatation was discovered by Bernard, 
Eckhardt, and Ludwig in the submaxillary glands, penis, and periph- 
eral vessels, respectively. 

The heart when cut out of the body still continues to beat, and the 
transmission of excitation from one cavity to another was experimented 
on by Paget, although removed completely from the influence of the cen- 
tral nervous system, and the vessels have a somewhat similar power of 
independent contractility. The alterations produced in the circulation 
generally and locally by the contractile power of the vessels and the 
changes caused in the vessels by the central nervous system by periiih- 
eral stimulation of the nerves or by variations in the quality of the 
blood have formed the subject of a series of researches extending over 
many years, and though originated and in many cases entirely conducted 
by Ludwig have appeared to a great extent under the names of his pupils. 
The starting point of these investigations was an examination of the 
changes in the blood as it flowed through isolated organs, with the view 
of ascertaining in what manner the combustion by which the animal heat

is iiuiintiiiued was effected in tlie body. While keeping u}) the circulation 
of blood through the vessels of muscles severed from the body, Ludwig- 
and Sczelkow' observed variations in the flow which appeared to indi- 
cate contractile power in the vessels themselves. This research was 
carried on under Ludwig's direction by various of his scholars in suc- 
cession, Alexander Schmidt, Dogiel, Sadler, myself, Ilafiz, Lcpine, A. 
Mostio, \ on Frey, and Gaskell. Their observations, as well as those of 
Cohuheim and Gunning, have shown that the muscular fibers of the 
arterioles, not only in the muscles but throughout the body generally, 
have a power of independent and sometimes rhythmical contraction 
and relaxation. Their contractility is, however, controlled by the cen- 
tral nervous system in accordance with the wants of the body generally, 
i'or tlie amount of blood contained in tlie body is insufficient to fill the 
whole of the vascular system at once, and when the vessels are fully 
dilated, as they are after death, we find that nearly the whole of the 
blood of the body may be contained in the veins alone. It is therefore 
necessary that when one part of the body is receiving a larger supply 
of blood another should be receiving a smaller supi)ly; and the func- 
tions of the vaso motor centers have been well compared by Ludwig to 
the turncocks in a great city, who cutoff' the water supply from one dis- 
trict at the same time they turn it on to another. Thus it is that when 
the brain is active the feet may get cold, and Mosso has shown this 
ill an exceedingly neat manner by placing a man on a large board deli- 
cately balanced at its center, and demonstrating that whenever the man 
began to think the increased supply of blood to his brain caused the 
head to go down and the heels to rise up. A similar condition was 
indicated bj' Mayow, who gave a different explanation. lie said that 
the vital spirits were not able to be in the same place at once, and there, 
fore it happens that if a man eats a heavy meal he is apt to become 
drowsy, because the vital spirits descend from the brain to the stomach 
in order to carry on digestion; and, on the other hand, if a man thinks 
vigorously after dinner the vital spirits have to leave the stomach to go 
to the brain, and conse([uently digestion is imperfectly i)erformed. If 
we substitute the word blood for vital spirits we have an exact expres- 
sion of present j)hysiological ideas. 

Ubi stimulus ibi affluxus was an old doctrine and expressed a great 
truth. Wherever the need for increased nourishment or increased sup- 
ply of oxygen exists in the healthy body, thither does the blood flow in 
larger quantities than usual. If the glands are active their blood snp- 
l)ly is greatly increased, as was shown by Bernard, and a similar occur- 
rence takes place in the contracting muscle, as has been shown by 
Ludwig and his scholars. The vessels of the intestines and of the 
skin, with their numerous glands, have their caliber regulated by the 
vasomotor nerves which i)roceed from the center in the medulla oblon-

gata. This center acts most readily upon the vessels of the intestine, 
and rather less readily on those of the skin. In consequence of this, 
when the center is irritated, the vessels of the intestine contract and 
drive the blood through the skin, so that it is warmer than before, 
and it is only when the stimulati<m is very great that the vessels 
of both contract so that the skin receives less blood than normal 
and becomes colder than before. But if the vessels of the skin and 
intestine are both contracted, where does the blood go? This ques- 
tion was put by Ludwig, and answered by. the experiments which 
he made with Haliz. It is evident that if the heart be stopped while 
the blood pressure is being measured in the artery of an animal the 
pressure will fall regularly and steadily, because the blood is flowing 
out all the time through the arterioles and capillaries into the veins. 
One would naturally expect that if the arterioles were contracted by 
irritation of the vasomotor centers in the medulla the fiill of blood 
pressure would either not take place at all or would be very much 
slower than before; but on trying tlie experiment, Ludwig and Ilafiz 
found to their surprise that the blood pressure fell almost as quickly as 
when the vasomotor center was left alone, and the vessels of the skin 
and intestine therefore remained uncontracted. In other words, the 
vessels which supply the muscles of the body and limbs are capable of 
such extension tliat when fully dilated they will allow the arterial blood 
to pour through them alone nearly as quickly as it usually does through 
the vessels of the skin, intestine, and muscles together. This obser- 
vation, it seems to me, is one of the greatest importance, and one that 
has hardly received as yet the attention which it merits. 

It is obvious that contraction of the cutaneous vessels, such as occurs 
upon exposure to cold, will drive more blood through the muscles, and 
as oxidation goes on more rapidly in them the result will be increased 
production of heat. 

The experiments I have just nicntioued show that the vessels of the 
muscles are not controlled by the vasomotor center in the medulla 
oblongata in the same way as those of the intestine and skin. IIow fsir 
their vascular centers may be associated with those for voluntary move- 
ments, which have been so admirably localized by Terrier in the cerebral 
cortex, still remains to be made out. The circulation through the mus- 
cles is indeed a complex phenomenon, and it was shown by Ludwig and 
Sadler to depend upon at least two factors having an antagonistic action. 
When a muscle is thrown into action, it mechanically compresses the 
blood vessels within it, and thus tends to lessen the circulation through 
it, but at the same time the stimulus which is sent down through the 
motor nerve, and which calls it into action, brings about a dilatation 
of the vascular walls, and thus increases the circulation through the 
muscle. 

When the amount of blood is measured before, during, and after 
stimulation of its motor nerves, it is sometimes found that the flow is 



MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OP HARVEY's WORK. 469 

diminished, at others that it is increased, the alteration depending upon 
the comparative eft'ect of the mechanical comj^ression of the vessels of 
the muscles just mentioned, and upon the increase of their lumen by the 
dilatation of their walls. It invariably liappens, however, that after 
the muscle has ceased to act, the flow of blood through the muscle is 
increased. This increase is quite independent of any alteration in the 
general pressure of blood in the arteries, and it occurs when an artiticial 
stream of blood, under constant pressure, is sent through the muscle. 
The dilatation in the muscular vessels, as indicated by the increased 
flow of blood, and consequent change of color in the frog's tongue, was 
observed by Lepine after stimulation of the periiiheral ends of the 
hypoglossal and glossopharyngeal nerves, and the actual changes in 
the vessels themselves were observed microscopically by von Frey and 
Gaskell. 

The dilatation of muscular vessels on irritation of peripheral nerves 
was thus brought into a line Math the dilatation noticed in the vessels 
of the submaxillary gland by. Bernard, and in the corpora cavernosa 
by Eckhart. It is evident that alteration in the size of such a huge 
vascular tract as the muscular arteries must influence, to a great extent, 
the blood pressure in the arteries generally, and it is equally evident 
that the changes induced in the condition of the blood pressure by 
muscular action may be of two kinds, either a rise or a fall. If the 
arterioles are compressed by the muscles so that the flow through them 
is impeded, the general blood pressure will rise. When this effect is 
more than counteracted by the dilatation of the arterioles themselves 
under nervous influence the general blood pressure will fall, for the 
blood will find an easy passnge through the vessels from the arteries 
into the veins. We can thus see how readily a rise or fall in the gen- 
eral blood pressure may be induced by exercise of the muscles. If 
they contract suddenly or violently they will tend to compress the 
arterioles, and .raise the blood pressure, while quite easy contraction 
will have little effect in compressing the arterioles, and these, becoming 
dilated, will allow the blood pressure to fall. 

But there is still another factor which may tend to increase the blood 
pressure during severe nuiscular exertion, viz, a quickened pulse for 
stimulation of the nerve fibers extending from the muscles to the cen- 
tral nervous system greatly accelerates the beats of the heart. In this 
respect stimulation of the muscular nerves diflers from that of the 
cutaneous and visceral nerves, inasmuch as the latter tend rather to 
slow than to quicken the pulse. The peculiar effect of the muscular 
nerves upon the heart wouhl, indeed, appear to be a provision of nature 
for the purpose of maintainingauexceedingly active circulation daring 
the active calls upon nutrition which violent exertions entail. Muscu- 
lar exercise, therefore, has a special tendency to raise the blood pres- 
sure in the arterial system, and consequently to increase the resistance 
which the left ventricle has to overcome. Moreover, in the case of the 



470 MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OF HARVEY's WORK. 

intestinal vessels there is a special provision made for preventing tlieir 
contraction from causing- too great a rise of arterial pressure. This 
consists in the depressor nerve, which passes from the heart and tends 
to produce dilatation of the abdominal vessels, and thus prevent any 
undue piessure occurring within the heart from their excessive con- 
traction. 

In the case of the muscles, we have no such nerve. Its jdace seems 
to be taken by tlie dilating fibers which occur in the motor nerves. As 
I have already said, liowever, this effect of ddatation in the nuiscular 
vessels may be at first more than counteracted by mechanical compres- 
sion at tlie commencement of exertion, and thus the blood pressure in 
the arteries, and tiie resistance which it opposes to the contraction and 
emptying of the ventricle, may be unduly increased. 

As a general rule the distention of any hollow muscular organ is 
attended with great i)aiu. How great is the suflering when obstruction 
of the bowel in-events evacuation of its contents; or when a calculus, 
in its passage down the gall duct or ureter, forcibly distends their wall. 
One of the severest tortures of the Middle Ages was to distend the 
stomach with water, and the Kmperin- Tiberius could imagine no more 
awful punishment for those whom he hated than to make them drink 
wine, and at the same time, by means of a ligature, to prevent the dis- 
tended bladder from emptying itself The heart is no exce]»tion to tliis 
rule, and distension of its cavities brings on most acute physical suf- 
feiing. Its inability to empty itself is a question of relative and not 
of absolute power; for a strong heart may be unable to work only 
against enormously increased resistance in the peripheral arterioles, 
while the heart, weakened by degeneration, may be unable to empty 
itself in face of pressure little, if at all, above the normal. 

When the contractile power of the heart is not, as it is in health, 
considerably in excess of the resistance opposed to it in vessels, but 
only nearly equal to it, a slight increase in the resistance nuiy greatly 
interfere with the power of the heart to empty itself, and bring on pain 
varying in amount from slight uneasiness to the most intense agony in 
angina ])ectoris. This is indeed what we find for a heart whose nutri- 
tion has been weakened by disease of the arteries, and consequent 
imperfect supply of blood to the cardiac nuiscle is unalde to meet any 
increased resistance if this should be ottered to it, and pain is at once 
felt. In such cases, unless they be far advanced, we find precisely as 
we might expect, that walking on the level usually causes no pain, but 
the attempt to ascend even a slight rise, by which the muscles are 
brought into more active exertion, brings on pain at once. Yet here 
again we find, as we should expect, that if the patient is able to con- 
tinue walking t-he pain passes ott" and does not return. These phe- 
nomena Avouldbe inexplicable were it not for Ludwig's observations on 
circulation through the muscles, but in the light of these observations 
everything is made perfectly intelligible. Walking on the flat, by

causing no violent exertion of tlie muscles, produces no mechanical con- 
striction of the vessels, and thus does not increase the blood pressure. 
The greater exertion of walking up a hill has this effect, but if the 
patient is able to continue his exertions, the increased dilatatiou of the 
vessels — a consequence of muscular activity — allows the i)ressurc again 
to fall and relieves the pain. 

As muscular exertion continues and the vessels of the muscles 
become dilated, the flow of blood from the arteries into the veins will 
tend to become much more rapid than usual. The pressure iu the 
arterial system will consequently fall, but that in the veins will become 
increased, and unless a corresponding dilatation occurs in the pulmo- 
nary circulation, blood will tend to accumulate in the right side of the 
heart, the right ventricle will be unable to empty itself completely, 
shortness of breath will arise, and even death may occur. At first the 
right side of the heart is affected, and the apex beat disappears from 
the normal place and is felt in the epigastrium, but the left ventricle 
also becomes dilated, though whether this is simply through nervous 
influence tending to make it act concordantly with the right, or for 
some other reason, it is at present impossible to say. Severe exertion, 
even for a few minutes, may produce this condition in healthy persons,^ 
and when the exertion is overcontinued it may lead to permanent mis- 
chief. More especially is this the case in young growing boys, and 
it is not merely foolish, it is wicked to insist upon boys engaging in 
games or contests which demand a long-continued overexertion of the 
heart, such as enforced races and paper chases extending over several 
miles. Intermittent exertion, either of a single muscle or of a groui^ of 
muscles, or of the whole body, appears to lead to better nutrition and 
increased strength and hypertrophy, but overexertion, especially if it 
continues, leads to impaired nutrition, weakness, and atrophy. If we 
watch the movements of young animals, we find that they are often 
rapid, but fitful and irregular and varied in character, instead of being 
steady, regular, and uniform. They are the movements of the butterfly, 
and not of the bee. The varied plays of childhood, the gambols of the 
lamb, and the frisking of the colt are all well adapted to increase the 
strength of the body without doing it any injury; but if the colt, 
instead of being allowed to frisk at its own free will, is put in harness, 
or ridden iu races, the energy which ought to have gone to growth is 
used up by the work, its nutrition is affected, its iwwers diminished, 
and its life shortened. The rules which have been arrived at by the 
breeders of horses ought to be carefully considered by the teachers of 
schools, and by the medical advisers who superintend the pupils. 

In youth and middle age every organ of the body is adapted for doing 
more work than it is usually called ui)on to do. Every organ can, as 
it is usually termed, make a spurt if required; but as old age comes on 
this capacity disappears, the tissues become less elastic, the arteries

becoiue more rigid aud less capable of dilating and allowing freer flow 
of blood to any part whether it be the intestine, the skin, the brain, the 
muscles, or the heart itself. Mere rigidity of the arteries supplying the 
muscles of the heart will lessen the power of extra exertion, but if the 
vessels be not only rigid, but diminished in caliber, the muscles of tlie 
limbs and the heart itself will be unfit even for their ordinary Avork, and 
will tend to fail on the slightest overexertion. This fact was noticed 
by Sir Benjamin Brodie, who, when speaking of patients with degener- 
ating and contracted arteries, such as lead to senile gangrene, said: 

"Such patients walk a short distance very well, but when they attempt 
more than this the muscles seem to be unequal to the task, and they 
can walk no farther. The muscles are not absolutely paralyzed, but 
in a state approaching to it. The cause of all this is sufficiently obvi- 
ous. Tlie lower limbs require sometimes a larger and sometimes a 
smaller supi)ly of blood. During exercise a large supply is wanted on 
account of the increased action of the muscles; but the arteries being 
ossified or obliterated, and thus incapable of dilatation, the increased 
supidy can not be obtained. This state of things is not j>eculiar to the 
lower limbs. Wherever muscular structures exist the same cause will 
l)roduce the same effect. Dr. Jenner first, and Dr. Parry, of Bath, 
afterwards, published observations which were suijposed to prove that 
the disease which is usually called angina pectoris dei)ends on ossifica- 
tion of the coronary arteries. - - - When the coronary arteries are 
in this condition they may be capable of admitting a moderate supply 
of blood to the muscular structure of the heart, and as long as the 
l)atient makes no abnormal exertion the circulation goes on well enough; 
when, however, the heart is excited to increased action, whether it be 
during a fit of passion, or in running, or walking upstairs, or lifting 
weights, then the ossified arteries being incapable of expanding so as to 
let in the additional quantity of blood, which under these circumstances 
is re(juired, its action stops and syncoi)e ensues; and I say that this 
exactly corresponds to the sense of weakness and want of muscular 
]>ower which exists in i^ersons who have thearteries of thelegs obstructed 
or ossified.*'' 

But the syncope and stoppage of the lieart mentioned b}* Brodie are 
not the only consequences of impaired cardiac nutrition. The heart 
may be still able to carry on the circulation, but the patient may suffer 
intense pain in the process. The outside of the heart was found by 
Harvey to be insensible to light touches, but the inside of the heart 
ai)pears to be much more sensitive either to touch or pressure. 

A knowledge of the mode of circulation of blood through the muscles 
enables us to understand uot only the pathology of angina pectoris, 
but the rationale of various methods of treating patients sufiering 
from angina pectoris or other forms of heart disease. In most cases our 
object is a twofold one — to increase the power of the heart and to lessen 
the resistance it has to overcome. In some cases we require also to aid 
the elimination of water which has so accumulated as to give rise to 
oedema of the cellular tissues or dropsy of the serous cavities. In our 

'Lectures on Pathology and Surgery, by Sir Boujaruin Brodie, London, 1846,

endeavors to produce these beuetieial changes in our patients we employ 
regimen, diet, and drugs, and it is evident that as in one case the con- 
dition of a patient's heart may be very different indeed from that in 
another, the regimen which may be useful to one may be fatal to the 
other. We have already seen that sudden and violent exertion may 
raise the blood pressure and so lead to intense cardiac pain or to stop- 
page of the heart and instant death, while more gentle exercises, by 
increasing the circulation through the muscles, may lessen the pressure 
and give relief to the heart. 

The methods of increasing the muscular circulation may be roughly 
divided into three, according as the patient lies, stands, or walks. 
First, absolute rest in bed with massage;' second, graduated move- 
ments of the muscles of the limbs and body while the patient stands 
still; third, graduated exercises in walking and climbing. 

The second of these methods has been specially worked out by the 
brothers Schott, of Nauheim, and the third is generally connected with 
the name of Oertel. It is obvious that in cases of heart disease where 
the failure is great and the patient is unable even to stand, much less 
to walk, where breathlessness is extreme and dro[)sy is present or 
is advanced, the second and third methods of treatment are inappli- 
cable. It is in such cases that the method of absolute rest in bed, not 
allowing the patient to rise for any purpose whatever, hardly allowing 
him to feed himself or turn himself in bed, proves advantageous. The 
appetite is usually small, the digestion imperfect, and flatulence trouble- 
some; and here an absolute milk diet, like that usually employed in 
tyjihoid fever, is often most serviceable, being easilj^ taken and easily 
digested, while the milk sugar itself has a diuretic action and tends to 
reduce dropsy. But while simple rest prevents the risk of increased 
arterial tension and consequent opposition to the cardiac contractions 
which might arise from muscular exertion, such benefits as would accrue 
from muscular exertion and increased circulation would be lost were 
t not that they can be sui)plied artificially by massage. This ])lan of 
treatment, although it has only recently been revived, was known to 
Harvey, who narrates the case of a man who, in consequence of an 
injury — of an effront which he could not revenge — was so overcome 
with hatred, spite, and passion that ''he fell into a strange disorder, 
suffering from extreme compression and i)ain in the heart and breast, 
from which he only received some little relief at last when the whole 
of his chest was pommeled by a strong man, as the baker kneads 
dough."' 

This was a very rough form of massage, but the same kneading 
movements which Harvey described have been elaborated into a com- 
plete system, more especially by Ling, in Sweden, and made widely 
known in America and this country by S. Weir Mitchell and Playfair.

*Tlie Works of William Harvey, Sydeuham Society's edition, page 128. 



474 MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OF HAEVEY's WORK. 

One iiii^lit naturally expect that kneading the muscles Avould increase 
tlie cii'culatioii through them in somewhat the same way as active exer- 
cise, but, to the best of my knowledge, no actual experiments existed 
to prove this, and I accordingly requested my friend and assistant, Dr. 
Tunniclifte, to test the matter experimentally. The method employed 
was, in the main, the same as that devised by Ludwig and employed 
by Sadler and Gaskell under his direction. The results were that dur- 
ing the kneading of a muscle the amount of venous blood which issued 
from it was sometimes diminished and sometimes increased ; that just 
after the kneading was over the How was diminished, apparently from 
the blood accumulating in the muscle, and this dimunition was again 
succeeded by a greatly increased flow exactly corresi)ouding to that 
observed by Ludwig and his scholars. 

The clinical results are precisely what one would expect from increased 
circulation in the muscles, aiul cases apparently hopeless sometimes 
recover most wonderfully under this treatment. For patients who are 
stronger, so that confinement to bed is unnecessary, and who yet are 
unable to take walking exercise, Schott's treatment is most useful, and 
it may be used as an adjunct to the later stages of the treatment just 
described, or as a sequel to it. Here the patient is made to go through 
various exercises of the arms, logs, and trunk with a certain amount of 
resistance, which is applied either by the patient himself setting in 
action the opposing muscles or by an attendant who gently resists 
every movement made by the patient, but graduates his resistance so 
as not to cause the least hurry in breathing or the least oppression of 
the heart. Perhaps the easiest w ay of employing graduated resistance 
is by the ergostat of Gartner, which is simply an adaptation of the 
labor crank of prisons, where the number of turns of a wheel can be 
regulated in each minute and the resistance, which is api)lied by a 
brake, may be graduated to an ounce. The objection to it is the uni- 
formity of movement and its wearisome monotony. Oertel's plan of 
gradually walking day by day up a steeper and steeper incline, and 
thus training the muscles of the heart, is well adapted for stronger 
persons, but when applied injudiciously may lead, just like hasty or 
excessive exertion, to serious or fatal results. In Schott's method stim- 
ulation of the skin by baths is used as an adjunct, and this may tend 
to slow the pulse, as already mentioned. But in all these plans the 
essence of treatment is the derivation of blood through a new channel, 
that of the muscular vessels, and the results in relieving cardiac distress 
and pain may be described in the same words which Harvey employs 
in reference to diseases of the circulation : "How speedily some of these 
diseases that are even reputed incurable are remedied and dispelled as 
if by enchantment." ^ 

There is yet another consequence of the circulation to which Harvey 
has called attention, although only very briefly, which has now become 

' The Works of William Harvey, Sydenham Society's edition, page 141. 



MODERN DEVELOPMENTS OF HARVEY'S WORK. 475 

of tlie utmost importance, and this is the admixture of blood from vari- 
ous parts of the body. After describing the intestinal veins, Harvey 
says: "The blood returning by these veins and bringing the cruder 
juices along with it on the one hand from the stomach, where they are 
thin, watery, and not yet perfectly chylified; on the other, thick and 
more earthy, as derived from the fteces, but all pouring into this splenic 
branch, ai-e duly tempered by the admixture of contraries," ' 

Harvey's chemical expressions are crude, for chemistry as a science 
only began to exist about a century and a half after Harvey's death, 
yet the general idea which he expresses in the words which I have just 
quoted is wonderfully near the truth. 

Two of the most important constituents of the blood are chloride of 
sodium nnd water. Chloride of sodium is a neutral salt, but during 
digestion both it and water are decomposed in the gastric glands, and 
hydrochloric acid is poured into the stomach, while a corresponding 
amount of soda is returned into the blood, whose alkalinity increases 
pan passu with the acidity of the stomach. Part of this alkali is 
excreted in the urine, so that the urine during digestion is often neu- 
tral or alkaline. Possibly some of it passes out through the liver in 
the bile, through the pancreas and intestinal glands into the intestine, 
where, again mixing with the acid chyle from the stomach, neutraliza- 
tion takes place, so that neutral and comparatively inactive chloride of 
sodium is again formed from the union of active alkali and acid. But 
it is most probable that what occurs in the stomach occurs also in the 
other glands, and that it is not merely excess of alkali resulting from 
gastric digestion which is poured out by the liver, pancreas, and intes- 
tine, but that these glands also decompose salts, pour the alkali out 
through the ducts, and return the acid into the blood. 

We are now leaving the region of definite fact and passing into that 
of fancy, but the fancies are not entirely baseless, and may show in 
what directions we may search out and study the secrets of nature by 
way of exi)eriment. For what is apparently certain in regard to the 
decomposition of chloride of sodium in the stomach, and probably in 
the case of neutral salts in the pancreas and intestine, is also probable 
in that important though as yet very imperfectly known class of bodies 
which are known as zymogens. Just as we have in the stomach an 
inactive salt, so we have also an inactive pepsinogen, which, like the 
salt, is split up in the gastric glands, and active pepsin is poured into 
the stomach. But is the pepsin the only active substance prod need f 
Has no other body, resulting from decomposition of the pepsinogen, 
been poured into tlie blood while the i)ei)sin passed into the stomach? 
Has the inactive pepsinogen not been split up into two bodies, active 
when apart, inactive when combined? May it not be fltly compared, 
as I have said elsewhere, to a cup or glass, harmless while whole, but

yielding sharp iiiul even dangerous splinters when broken, although 
these may again be united into a harmless ^Yhole"? ^ 

This question at present we can not answer, but in the pancreas there 
is an indication that something of the kind takes place, for Lepiue has 
discovered that while this gland pours into the intestine a ferment 
which converts starch into sugar, it pours through the lymphatics into 
the blood another ferment which destroys sugar. Whether a similar 
occurrence takes place in regard to its other ferments in the pancreas, 
or in the glands of the intestine, we do not know, nor do we yet know 
whether the same process goes on in the skin, and whether the secre- 
tion of sweat, which is nsaally looked upon as its sole function, 
bears really a relationship to cutaneous activity similar to that which 
the secretion of bile bears to the functions of the liver. There are indi- 
cations that such is the case, for when the skin is varnished, not only 
does the temperature of the animal rapidly sink, but congestion occurs 
in internal organs, and dropsy takes place in serous cavities, while in 
extensive burns of the skin rapid disintegration of the blood corpuscles 
occurs. It IS obvious that if this idea be at all correct, a complete 
revolution will be required in the views we have been accustomed to 
entertain regarding the action of many medicines. In the case of 
purgatives and diaphoretics, for example, we have looked mainly at the 
secretions poured out after their administration for an explanation of 
their usefulness, whereas it may be that the main part of the benetit 
that they produce is not by the substances liberated through the secre- 
tions they cause, but by those returned from the intestine and skin into 
the circulating blood. 

How important an effect the excessive admixture of the juices from 
one part of the animal body with the circulating blood might have was 
shown in the most striking way by Wooldridge. He found that the 
juice of tin; thyroid gland, though it is harmless while it remains in the 
gland, and is probably useful when it enters the blood in small quan- 
tities in the ordinary course of daily life, yet if injected into the blood 
will cause it to coagulate almost instantaneously and kill the animal as 
quickly as a rifle bullet. What is i)owerful for harm is likewise pow- 
erful for good in these cases, and the administration of thyroid juice 
in cases of myxcedema is one of tiie most remarkable therapeutic dis- 
coveries of modern times. Since the introduction by Corvisart of pep- 
sin as a remedy in dyspepsia, digestive ferments have been largely 
employed to assist the stomach and intestine in the performance of 
their functions, but very little has been done until lately in the way 
of modifying tissue changes in the body by the introduction of ferments 
derived from solid organs. For ages back savages have eaten the raw 
hearts and other organs of the animals which they have killed, or the 
enemies they have conquered, under the belief that they would thereby 
obtain increased vigor or courage; but the first definite attempt to cure

a disease by supplying' a ferment from a solid nonglandular organ of tlie 
body was, I believe, made in Harvey's own liospital by the use of raw 
meat in diabetes.' It was not, however, until Brown-Sequard recom- 
mended the use of testicular extract that the attention of the profession 
became attracted to the use of extracts of solid organs. Since then 
extract of thyroid, extract of kidney, extract of supra renal capsule have 
been employed; but even yet they are only upon their trial, and the 
limits of their utility have not yet been definitely ascertained. 

But yet another therapeutic method has been recently introduced 
which bids fair to be of the utmost importance, the treatment of dis- 
ease by antitoxins. The discovery by Pasteur of the dependence of 
many diseases upon the presence of mihute organisms may be ranked 
with that of Harvey, both in regard to the far-reaching benefits which 
it has conferred upon mankind and for the simplicity of its origin. The 
germ of all his discoveries was the attempt to answer the apparently 
useless question, "Why does a crystal of tartaric acid sometimes 
crystallize in one form and sometimes in another?" From this germ 
sprung his discovery of the nature of yeast and of those microbes 
which originate fermentation, putrefaction, and disease. These minute 
organisms, far removed from man as they are in then- structure and 
place in nature, appear in some respects to resemble him in the proc- 
esses of their growth and nutrition. They seem, indeed, to have the 
power of splitting up inactive bodies into substances having a great 
physiological or chemical activity. From grape sugar, which is coni- 
])aratively inert, they produce carbonic acid and alcohol, both of which 
have' a powerful physiological action. From inert albumen they pro- 
duce albumoses having a most powerful toxic action, and to the poi- 
sonous properties of these substances att-^ntion was for a while alone 
directed. But it would appear that at the same time they produce 
poisons they also form antidotes, and when cultivated without the body 
and introduced into the living organism they give rise to the produc- 
tion of these antidotes in still greater quantity. 

The plan of protection from infective diseases which was first 
employed by Jenner in smallpox is now being extended to many other 
diseases, and the protective substances which are formed in th'? body 
and their mode of action are being carefully investigated. The intro- 
duction either of pathogenic microbes or of toxic products appears to 
excite in the body a process of tissue change by which antitoxins are 
produced, and these may be employed either for the purpose of protec- 
tion or cure. By the use of antitoxins tetanus and diphtheria appear 
to be deprived of much of their terrible power. But it seems probable 
that a similar result may be obtained by the introduction of certain 
tissue juices into the general circulation. It was shown by Wooldridge 
that thyroid juice has a power of destroying anthrax ]>oison, and it 
seems probable that increase of the circulation of certain organs will

increase their tissue activity, will throw their juices or the i)roducts of 
their functional activity into the general circulation, and thus influence 
the invasion or progress of disease. As I have alieady mentioned, we 
are able to influence the circulation in muscles both by voluntary exer- 
tion and by passive massage, and we should expect that both of these 
measures wouhl influence the constituents of the blood generally, and 
such, indei'd, appears to be the case, for J. K. Mitchell ' has found that 
after massage the nundjer of blood corpuscles in the circulation is very 
considerably increased. 

Had time allowed it, I had intended to discuss the modifications of 
the heart and vessels by the introduction of remedies into the (ircula- 
tion, the ])(>\ver of drugs to slow or strengthen, to (|uickeii oi- weaken 
the power of the heart, to contract or relax the arterioles, to raise or 
lower the blood pressure, to relieve jiain, or to remove dropsy ; but to do 
this would require time far exceeding that of a single lecture. More- 
over, the methods and results were admirably expounded to the college 
by Dr. Leech in his Croonian lecture, and I have therefore thought 1 
should be better fulfilling the wish of Harvey that the orator of the 
year should exhort the fellows and members of the college to searc-h 
out the secrets of nature by way of experiment by directing their 
attention to fields of research which have received at present little 
attention, but promise results of great practical value. Lastly, I have 
to exhort you to continue in mutual love and aflection among your- 
selves; and it seems to me that the best way of doing this is to direct 
your attention to the examples of Harvey and of our late president, 
whose death we deplore to-day. They were beloved by their fellows 
while they lived, their loss Av^as lamented when they died, and they 
have left behind them an exami)le not only of goodness*, but of courage. 
Harvey, seated si)eechless in his chair, distributing rings and parting 
gifts to his friends while awaiting the approach of death, and Andrew 
Clark, steadfastly determining to continue at work and die in harness, 
in spite of the hemoptysis which seemed to threaten a speedy death, 
afford us noble examples which ought to encourage us to follow the 
directions of the venerable Longfellow, who, taking the organ Harvey 
studied to symbolize such courage as Harvey and Clark showed, says:

ANTS' NESTS.' 



By Dr. August Forel. 



A nest is a temporary or j)ermanent, naturally or artiticially formed 
hiding' place, which serves as a dwelling- for an animal and its family 
or for a more numerou-s- society of animals. The nest is also intended, 
at the same time, for ]»rote('tion against enemies and against the inclem- 
ency of the weather and of the temperature. There are, however, not 
only purely natural nests (such as natural caves and hollows) and 
purely artificial nests (such as blackbirds' nests), but also, in numy 
cases, mingled forms, where natuial hiding places are completed by 
artificial heli). Nests may also be divided into transient or season nests 
and permanent nests. 

Now, in the case of animals which live in large societies, such as 
beavers, wasps, and ants, the nest becomes a complicated building or 
labyrinth. Tliere are also elaborate and rough primitive nests. 

The ants, or Formicida', form a great family of the insect order of the 
Hymenoptera. They number upwards of two thousand known species, 
distributed throughout the whole earth, which form about one hundred 
and fifty genera. All species of ants live in societies, and almost all 
display a peculiar so-called polymori)hism; tliat is, every species con- 
sists, not only of a female, usually winged, and a male, usually winged, 
differing extremely from each other in the whole structure of their 
bodies, but also of other individuals without wings, which are offspring 
of the female sex, and are called "workers." The division, however, 
goes still further in certain species, the "worker" caste being subdi- 
vided into two kinds — differing greatly in their physical structure — 
"workers" and " soldiers." r>etween these there are species with inter- 
mittent Avorkers, the largest of which resemble the "soldiers;" that is, 
form a phylogenetic precursor to the "soldiers." 

Most of the female and male ants are winged, and copulate in the 
air or in the tops of trees; but at least one of the sexes is always 
winged. The new colonies are almost invariably founded by a pregnant 
I'emale, or by several such, as has already been stated by Huber, and

has been clearly proved in recent years by MacCook, lAibbock, Bloch- 
mann, and otliers. These females live many years (eight to twelve 
years, according to Lnbbock's experiments), and always rem;iin ])roIiiic 
withont renewed copulation. They are the mothers of the whole 
so-called ant colony, which, consequently, lasts many years and does 
not die out annually like the wasp colony. It follows from the facts 
stated that the ants must have permanent nests, and that these nests 
must display great variety, both of which inferences are correct. 

The ants have, moreover, the peculiarity of changing their abode 
from time to time in order to move to a new one. They understand how 
to change theii- dwelling and how to build anew. 

Many species of ants understand likex^ise how to colonize; that is, 
how to build new nests at a certain distance from their dwellings with- 
out leaving their old nest. It is in this way that mighty colonies, with 
numerous nests, are founded, resembling, to use Huber's words, the 
cities of one and the same emjiire. I have counted as many as two 
hundred immense nests standing close together in our European Form tea 
exsecia Nyl., and MacCook has counted as many as sixteen hundred 
still larger nests of one and the same colony of Formica e.rsccfoidcs 
FoREL in the Alleghanies of Xorth America. These latter ant kingdoms 
have, in all probability, a population of 200,000,000 to 400,000,000 
inhabitants, all forming a single community and living together in 
active and friendly intercourse, while they are on hostile terms witli all 
other colonies of ants, even those of the same species. Certain kinds of 
ants which live in trees form similar kingdoms by occupying numerous 
trees of the same forest. 

In addition to this, ants frequently construct annexes to their nests — 
covered ways, subterranean passages, stations, and flying camps — in 
order to protect the plant lice which serve them as milk cows, and 
also for other purposes. 

It is further to be remarked that there are courageous, warlike kinds 
of ants, whose nests pre, consequently, open and easily discovered, 
while other kinds are timid and live in concealment, in many cases, 
because their colonies consist of only a few individuals. There are, 
besides, ants with good eyes, which make their nests above ground, 
and even on the boughs of trees, while there are blind and half blind 
kinds which live hidden deep underground. 

As I have formerly asserted (Fourmis de la Suisse, 1874), the chief 
feature of ant architecture, in contradistinction to that of the bees 
and the wasps, is its irregularity and want of uniformity — that is to say, 
its adaptability, or the capacity of making all the surroundings and 
incidents subserve the purpose of attaining the greatest i)ossible econ- 
omy of space and time and the greatest possible comfort. For instance, 
the same species will live in the Alps under stones which absorb the 
rays of the sun; in a forest it will live in warm, decayed trunks of 
trees; in a rich meadow it will live in high, conical mounds of earth. 



ants' nests. 481 

I will attempt to make a classification of the nests of ants, corre- 
sponding- approximately to that which I formerly made with a view 
simply to giving an outline of the variety of the dwellings of ants. 
Of course, taking into consideration the above-mentioned features of 
ant architecture, it is impossible to be systematic. 

I.— TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EXISTING CAVITIES. 

Many ants use as nests simply the clefts and crevices of rocks and 
the space between two stones. They wall up and barricade the exte- 
rior of the clefts with sand, pebbles, and dry vegetable particles; tliey 
divide the surface, more or less, into chambers, and leave only one or a 
few doors (holes) open, to allow themselves egress. Many sjjecies of 
the genus Leptothorax live in this way, in small colonies, and Plcu/iolepis 
pygmwa Latr., Cremastogdster aordklida Nyl., Prenolepis lou(jieoniis 
Latr., etc., in larger colonies, in the same manner. 

Some such species have adapted themselves specially to mankind and 
occupy the walls of our houses. They know how to avail themselves 
there of the space between the stones; they bite away the mortar with 
all their might and carry it away in order to procure for themselves 
safe and warm lodgings in the neighborhood of our domestic stores, 
which they pillage thoroughly at the first opportunity. Such ants 
which have adapted themselves to the walls of our dwellings are Lasius 
emarginatus Latr., Monomorium pharaonis L. (imported into seaports 
from the Tropics), Pheidole megacephala Fabr. These insects, as is 
well known, become house nuisances. 

But other natural cavities are also made use of, esj)ecially those made 
by other insects. The species of Leptothorax and GolohopHis with us, 
those of Poly r hack is and Crema-stogaster in tropical countries, know how 
to make use of the cavities of galls which have been abandoned by the 
gallfly for their nests. 

Fig. 1, Plate LV, rej^resents a stem gall from Delagoa Bay, South- 
east Africa, one-sixth smaller than the natural size, which was inhabited 
by a colony of Polyrhachis r/erstiickeri Forel, and which was sent to me 
by our countryman, the missionary physician. Dr. Liengme, living there* 
The Polyrhachis had affixed some of their weaving to the inside, B. 
The egress opening made by the gallfly was the door of their nest. 
Cavities made by bark beetles in wood are used among us as nests by 
the species of Liometopum and Lasius, and especially by Lasius hrunneus 
Lath., Formica fusca, etc. In the same way the space between the 
outer layers of the bark of trees (especially the conifers), the under 
side of the bark of dead trees, the under side of beds of moss, etc., are 
used as nests by the species of Leptothorax and other small ants. Ants 
also live frequently in hollow fruits, potatoes, and, above all, in large 
tropical fruits. Mr. Ortgies found the little Bracliymyrmcx Jieeri For. 
in the lower part of the pots of the tropical orchids in the Zurich hot- 
house, which were filled with moss, etc. My friend and colleague, Pro-

fessor Stoll, found tLe nests of Vamponotus atriceps Sm,, race stereo- 
rariiis Forel, constautly under tbe dried excrement of cattle, and 
even inside of it, in Guatemala. 

Pere Cambone, in Antananarivo, Madagascar, sent me a stalk of 
Sokmum anriculatum, the soft marrow of wliicli, excavated and divided 
nto compartments, served as a nest for Technomi/rmex albipc.s Smith 
In this case the gnawing capacity of the ants had made the natural 
object serviceable. A portion of this nest is represented in fig. 2, 
two-thirds of natural size. 

Dr. Goldi, in Eio de Janeiro, sent me several specimens of Camponoius 
cingidatus Mayr,, a very handsome, rather large ant, as the regular 
inhabitant of the hollows (internodes) of the bamboos there. Pere 
Camboue, in Antananarivo, sent me Preiiolepis ellisii Forel from the 
hollow stalks of one of the Malvace.ie, in -which it lives. Major Yer- 
bury, of Ceylon, sent me, by Mr. Wroughton, Gamponotus reiieidaius 
Roger, with its nest, which was also in a hollow stalk. Mr. Wrough- 
ton, divisional forest officer at Poonah, India, sent me the nests of a very 
small ant, CariHoc<rn(lyla wronghton'ii Forel, which he had fouml in 
the si)ace between the two surfaces of the leaves of a tree [Eiujenia 
jambohnKi), the ])arenchym of which (the green of the leaf between the 
exterior membranes) had evidently been devoured by a very small cater- 
pillar. This nest of Cardioconilyla n'roKghtoniiM represented in tig. 3 
by Mr. ];. Schroter. 

The well known ant nests in the hollow acacia thorns of tropical 
lauds also belong to this class; but more on this subject hereafter. 

2.— EARTH NESTS. 

Earth is the most usual material for the nest building of auts. It is 
well known (Gould, Huber, etc.) that the ordinary earth structures 
(mounds) of many of our ants are created by the workeis mining under 
ground after rainy weather, bringing the wet jjarticles of earth to the 
surface of the ground and pressing them into walls and vaults by means 
of their mandibles and forelegs, using at the same time blades of grass 
etc., as pillars and inside walls. In this way are made the Avell-known 
labyrinths, which I myself have Avatched innumerable times. It is, 
however, an unsolved ]>roblem whether really, as Huber thought, water 
alone always suffices as cement for the earth or whether it is not in 
some cases mixed with a secretion of the glands of the ants. The great 
firmness of certain structures, for instance those of Lasiiis Jiavns, t^ivcs 
some probability to the latter sui)positiou, particularly when we 
consider the fragile character of the structures of other kinds of ants. 

Earth nests may be divided into three classes: 

(a) Nests ichich are entirely excavated. — In this case passages and 
chambers are simply excavated in the ground, without the particles of 
earth which are dug out being worked up into an artificial upper struc. 
ture; they are merely thrown away. There are many kinds of auts 



ants' nests. 483 

which mine only in this way, as, for example, Ponera contractu Ltr., 
Myrmecocystus, all the Dorylides, Aphamogaster snhterranea Ltr., and, 
in general, most of the blind and half-blind species. Besides these 
many other species do it occasionally, such as Formica fasca L., Formica 
rufibarhis F., Tetramorium cwspitum L., species of j\lyrmica, etc. 

One variety of the mined nests consists of those in which the ants 
heaj) up the excavated earth in banks around the openings of the nest 
so that crater-shaped openings are the result. This occurs most fre- 
quently in sandy soil. These banks are not genuine upper structures, 
although they often resemble them closely. We iind them in the case 
of Messor ,structor, Messor harbarus, species of Pheidole, Acantholepis 
frauenfcldi, Pogonomyrmex^ etc. A peculiar variety of this class is 
formed by the crescent-shaped mounds of Messor arenarius Fab., first 
noticed by me in the Sontli Tunis desert near Cabes, which consist of 
coarse but very perishable globes of sand. At certain times the aper- 
tures of the Messor nests are, in addition, surrounded by mounds com- 
posed of the hulls of the seeds which have been gathered, wliich hulls 
have been thrown out of the nests. The little Cardiocondyla elegans 
Em. and stambuloffii Forel make small nests in the sand on the 
seashore. 

The subterranean structures of some kinds of ants are, in certain 
cases, extremely interesting. Certain species dig passages which go 
down very deep and branch off laterally, forming subterranean cor- 
ridors, and in many cases leading to root i)lant lice {Lasius faviis) or 
serving for other purposes. The underground hunts of the species of 
Dorylus, or visiting ants, are partially carried on in this manner. These 
are blind robber ants, which carry on an underground hunt after all 
conceivable ground insects, as I myself have observed in Tunis. They 
are also called "visiting ants," because they frequently make a sud- 
den attack at night upon dwelling houses and destroy all the vermin 
in them. 

The species of Messor (Europe), Pogonomyrmex (America), and Hol- 
comyrmcx (India) construct under ground, at a considerable depth 
(often at the depth of a yard), very large chambers or granaries, in 
which they store the seeds which they have gathered. In the same 
way the species of the American genus Atta excavate extremely deep 
and extensive -passages and make immense chambers, in which they 
store the leaves which they have cut from trees, in order to lay oft" upon 
them the fungus gardens from which they supply themselves with food- 
This discovery, which was first made by Belt and subsequently declared 
by MacCook to be incorrect, has been recently confirmed by Dr. 
Moller, of Blumenau, in its full extent and by superb exi)eriments. 

A great deal of interest is likewise attached to the underground 
hunts carried on by the ants of the genus Lobopelta in India, after the 
termites, according to the careful observations of Mr. Wroughton. 
They feed upon these white ants, and pursue them in their own pas- 



484 ants' nests. 

sages. I coujecture that the same thing is true of the various species 
of the genus Leptogenys^ and that they use their long, thin, pointed, 
sickle-sliaped jaws, which bear a strong resemblance to a curved 
needle, to i^ierce the termites, whicli they then devour by the aid of 
their comparatively powerful under jaw. 

(b) N'esfs under stones. — As is well known, wherever there are sto.ies 
on dry declivities, etc., innumerable ants' nests are found under tfiem. 
The stone serves as a roof, under which are the most beautiful corridors 
and chambers. Under these lies the mined nest. The stone serves, 
above all, to produce a speedy warming by means of tlie rays of the 
sun. The ants under it are always in the highest story, in damp or cool 
weather, as soon as the sun shines or begins to iienetrate. As soon as 
the sun disappears the insects go below. They also go below when the 
sun shines too strong. 

The same species which mine, and which build earthen structures 
above ground, also live under stones as soon as they find any. The stone 
must be neither too small and thin nor too thick and large. Stones of 
2 to 15 centimeters in thickness are the most desirable, according to the 
size of the ants and the extent of their colonies. They allow the best 
regulation of the heat for the brood. 

The si)ecies of Lasius, Formica, Myrmica, Tetramoriuin, Plar/iolepis, 
Pheidole, Camponotus, Aphw7io(jastcr, Bothriomyrmex, Tapinoma, and 
other genera, are found in swarms under stones among us in Europe. 
There are few genera of ants that never live under stones. 

(c) Earth structures above ground. — Many kinds of ants are excellent 
masons, but by no means all. It is easier to mine than to construct 
walls, vaults, and pillars. 

1 advise everyone who wishes to see one of the most beautiful dis- 
plays of animal instinct and animal intelligence to equip himself with 
an umbrella, and with patience, on some warm day in May, when it 
begins to rain after a drought, or when it has just stopped raining, to 
repair to -a meadow, and there, with the greatest perseverance, to 
watch attentively the surface of the ant-hills and the actions of their 
occupants. He must at the same time watch closely individual ants 
and their work. He will then admire the skill and foresight of these 
insects, and will see how the little architects and masons understand 
how to turn every blade of grass, every stalk, every leaf, to account, by 
means of their earth mortar, in the erection of vaults, pillars, walls, etc. 
In this manner are made those no less numerous than wonderful earth 
labyrinths which serve the ants in our meadows as conical super- 
structures. Our tig. 9 represents a fragment of the moun<l of an earth 
nest of Lasius niger. It can be seen how blades of grass and leaves are 
used in the masonry as pillars, arches, etc. The drawing, which is two- 
thirds of the natural size, was made by Mr. L. Schroter, like all the others, 
from the original piece, which I had hardened with a solution of silica. 
I need not add that a mined nest always lies under the superstructure 



ants' nerts. 485 

of the mound-building ants. What purpose does tlie latter serve? 
Judging from my own observations, the same purpose as the stones, to 
wit, to procure warmth for the brood. The grass springs ui) in May, 
and with it the ant mounds. These afford protection against the 
dampness and the shade of the primeval forest; for such is a meadow 
to the ants. Up there, under the roof of the inound, the rays of the 
sun are felt. We have in Europe a small ant {Tapinonia erratictim 
Latr.) whose perishable earth structures, first described by me, can, 
to all appearance, serve no other purpose. It builds hastily around 
the blades of grass a comparatively very high and steep mound of 
earth, which consists of little more than the upper, superficial, thin 
vault. Inside there are often only a few wretched thin chambers, 
especially where the grass is thick. The ants hold their brood partly 
in their upper jaws, ]>artly lay them on leaves. They crowd together 
under the mound to warm themselves in the rays of the sun. After 
the harvest the mounds of the Tapinonia disappear, while those of the 
other ants remain standing. The latter, however, also become more 
and more flattened as autumn approaches. Our fig. 12 represents the 
perpendicular cross section of a nest of Taphionia erraticum Latr., 
from Vaux, Canton Vaud, Switzerland, which was strengthened and 
preserved by me by means of a solution of silica, and is now in the 
Entomological Museum of the Federal Poly teclmikum. Mr. L. Schroter 
has drawn the nest of two-thirds of the natural size. D, the temporary 
earthen cupola ; Min, the beginning of the underground mined structure. 

Among us mounds of earth with labyrinths are built by all the spe- 
cies of Lasius, with the exception of Lasius fuliginosus Ltr,, hrunneiis 
Ltr., and emarginatus Ol. ; also by Tetramorium cn'S2ntum , the species 
of Myrmica, several of Formica and Camponotus^ and the species of 
Tapinoma; and in Tunis by Monomorium salomonis, Apluvno(jaster 
striola, sardoa, testaceopilosa, crocea, etc. The best artist is the most 
common of all ants, Lasius niger L., which swarms in all our gardens. 
This ant also constructs covered passages along the stalks of plants, 
where in this way it walls up its plant lice and cochineal kermes in 
artistic stalls. The species of Myrmica frequently build earthen stalls 
around the jdant lice on the stalks of plants without putting them in 
communication with the ant-hill by a covered way. 

In the island of St. Thomas I saw earthen structures made by 
SoIenoj)sis geminata ¥. In Australia the large species of the genus 
Myrmica, Avliich are 20 to 28 millimeters long, build immense nests of 
earth. 

A seed-harvesting ant in Colorado, Pogonomyrniex occidentalis Cres- 
SON, builds a very peculiar and isolated variety of the earthen mounds. 
It i)lasters or paves the whole upper surface of its earthen mound 
uniformly and in mosaic with a layer of small white stones, which, 
according to MacCook's observations, it frequently brings from a great 
depth in the ground. The still unknown object of this paving is prob- 



486 ants' nests. 

ably the same as that of the earthen mounds in general. It is extraor- 
dinary that the little paving- stones are placed side by side with great 
regularity like a street pavement, while the interior of the cui)ola contains 
no stones whatever. MacCook has even seen upon these mounds stones 
containing fossil remains and native gold. Mr. Henry de Saussure, of 
Geneva, made similar observations before MacCooh among the genuine 
Pogonomyrmex barbatus i. sp., Smith, but did not publish them. 

3._W00D NESTS. 

There are also woodcutters among the ants, and in not a feAv cases 
the same species knows how to make earthen structures and how to 
hollow outwjod, as, for instance, our Gampouotus lujniperdus Latr. 

The best woodcutters are those species of the genus GaDiponotm 
Mayr, which have a short, broad head, rounded ofl'in front, especially 
the subgenus Colobopsis Mayr. 

These ants frequently bore with their short, powerful jaws into the 
very hardest wood, and construct secure and elegant labyrinths for 
themselves in it. This is the case with Camponoius pubeficcns in Wallis 
and Tessiii, and Camponotns marginatus. The latter bores into the 
softer layers of the wood when they are somewhat decayed and lets 
the harder part remain, so that its nests are more concentric around 
the center of the bough or trunk in their arrangement. I have noticed 
them in cherry trees and Paulowiiias. 

The smaller and very timid species of Colobopsis build themselves 
nests in the hardest wood. These nests open outward by only a very 
few small apertures, which are concealed by the irregularities of the 
bark of the tree. These apertures are kept closed by the head of a 
"soldier'' sentinel, who permits only friends to enter. The soldier's 
head is broadened and rounded off in front, evidently for this very use. 
The rounded surface (front view in iig. 11, magnified ten times) is 
rough, of a dull-brown color; the feelers are planted back of the 
rounded surface, so that the latter presents no hold and blocks uj) the 
entrance to the nest like a living stopper. I first observed this fact 
among our Colobopsis fruncofa Spin, at Yaux, Canton Yaud (fig. 13, 
drawn four-thirds of the natural size), but the similar structure of the 
head and the habit of living in trees, which characterize the other 
species of Colobopsis, lead us to infer that they live in the same way. 

Fig. 13 represents a portion of the original piece of a nest of CoJo- 
bopsis truncata discovered by me in a very hard, dead bough of a pear 
tree. B is the bark of the pear tree; Ch is the chambers and pas- 
sages of the nest; O is the exterior opening of the nest; behind it, in 
the gallery of egress of the nest, stands a Colobopsis "soldier" as a 
sentinel, keeping the door closed with his head. At W are seen two 
Colobopsis workers, one hastening toward the door from the outside, the 
other standing in the nest. The soldier will go back into the nest for a 
moment in order to let the first worker come in (I have noticed this 



ants' nests. 487 

among" the living ants). That the part played by the Colobopsis "sol 
diers"' is that of a living- stopper is further proved by the fact that there 
are comparatively few of them, and that iu contrast to the workers they 
hardly ever go out. Fig. 19 represents a " soldier," still more magnifled, 
standing at the door of egress. 

Those species of Camponotus which live in a similar way, such as 
Camponotus marginatus Latr., display the beginning of a similar 
rounded surface on the front part of the head, and always have a large- 
headed sentry at the door. 

Ltptothorax acervonim F. cuts small, very simjile nests, sjiread out 
flat, with few chambers in the outer layer (the cork layer) of the bark 
of the tree. Fig. 5 represents such a nest two-thirds of the natural size 
in the bark of a lir. 

4.— COMBINED STRUCTURES. 

The structures heretofore described are combined in a variety of 
ways. 

For instance, the hollow stalk of a large Arcangelica is idled from 
top to bottom by LasiKs nhjcr with small earthen chambers and occu- 
pied by them. Decayed trunks of trees are made use of by cuts which 
elsewhere build iu the ground, excavated, and worked up into nests by 
Lasius niyer, Lasius favKS, Formica fusca, ]\ryrmiv(( Iceviuodis, etc. 
Here wood dust and earth are used as mortar in the construction of 
chand)ers and galleries. Formica rufa L. excavates the softer portions 
of the wood in half decayed trunks of trees and builds in them laby- 
rinths which form a part of its nests. 

Lasius brunneus Latr. lives habitually in half-rotten trunks of trees 
and beams, after excavating the moist, decayed wood. It also lives in 
decayed woodwork in our houses, as do likewise frequently Liisius 
nm brat us ISTgl. 

The architecture of the grouj) of forest ants, Formica rufa L., praf en- 
sis De Geer, trnncicola Nyl., exsecta Ngl., and pressilahris Nyl., as 
well as of their North American relatives, F. exsectoidcs Forel, iuleyra 
Nyl., obscuripes Forel, etc., is, however, more imposing and more 
interesting. 

These ants nune the ground, but cover their nests with dry vegetable 
matter of the most varied kinds — pine and fir cones, dry leaves and 
pieces of wood, snail shells, little balls of rosin; blades of grass, in a 
word, with every kind of round and cylindrical materials. With these 
they build the well-known immense mounds, with their singular frame- 
work and the indescribable interior labyrinth, the most thoroughly 
perforated part of which is in the middle, at about the level of the 
ground. Earth serves partially as cement. The openings of the nest 
are carefully closed with small pieces of wood at night or when it is 
raining. They are opened by the workers in the morning and generally 
iu warnj, fine weather. 



488 ants' nests. 

. The mound is gradually enlarged aud strengthened by materials 
dragged to it. It protects the interior perfectly against cold and rain. 

Formica rufa i. sp. of the fir woods uses chiefly lir leaves; Formica 
pratensis of the meadows builds flatter mounds and uses more iiieces 
of wood and blades of grass, pieces of dry branches, etc.; Formica 
exseeta uses more particles of dry leaves, etc.; Formica sanf/idnea 
Latr. builds mounds composed of the above-mentioned materials and 
earth; its work is partly that of a carpenter and partly masonry; the 
latter, however, which is executed by the "slaves" [Formica fusca), 
usually prevails. 

It is impossible for us to describe everything, and we refer our 
readers to Huberts admirable description of the way in which the forest 
ants and the earthen-mound ants build their nests. It may well be 
said that almost every species — either in earthen structures, in wood 
uests, or in combined structures — has its peculiarities with regard to 
the quality of the material, the fineness of the grain, the shape and 
arrangement of the mound and the labyrinth, the comparative thick- 
ness of the walls, the size of the chambers, etc., so that the species 
may frequently be known by the structure. 

Still the ants often rob one another's nests, and this frequently 
renders it difficult to recognize the architect. 

There are species, it is true, whose architecture can hardly be dis- 
tinguished, as, for instance, the little species of Myrmica. 

5.— PASTEBOARD NESTS AND SPUN NESTS. 

I have already, in the Mittheilungen of the Swiss Entomological 
Society, Vol. YIII, part 6, 1891, given some information with regard to 
the singular nests which are now to occupy onr attention. A well- 
known European species, Lasiiis fuUginosus Latr., builds peculiar 
pasteboard nests, which Huber erroneously thought to be excavated in 
wood, while Meinert, Mayr, and others, including myself, have demon- 
strated their true nature beyond a doubt. They are composed of tlie 
finest i^articles of wood dust or of earth and small stones, which, by 
means of a viscous substance secreted by the ants, are worked up into 
so strong a pasteboard (see Forel, Fourmis de la Suisse, \^\^. 181-187) 
that the partitions between the excavations are extremelj' thin (as 
thin as visiting cards). These nests are mostly found in hollow trees. 
That they are not excavated, but are comi)Osed of pasteboard, I have 
clearly shown by microscopic cuts. Meinert first called attention to 
the fact that in LasiKsfidiginosus the glands of the upper jaw are 
extraordinarily large, and conjectured that they are the glands which 
secrete this viscous substance (cement). In facta comparative physio- 
logical study of this gland which Wolff (" The smelling organ of 
bees") erroneously designated asthesmelling-mucous gland, shows that 
a discovery which has been misinterpreted by Wolff" is of sj^ecial value. 
Tbe substance secreted by this gland, both in bees aud in ants, aud 



ants' nests. 489 

also the secretion of the posterior glands of certain ants (tlie Doluiliod-- 
erides, with whom it serves as a weapon for smearing the faces of their 
enemies), is immediately decomposed at the first contact with the air, 
with a violent production of gas bubbles and the development of an 
aromatic odor which is very peculiar. As soon as this chemical decom- 
position is completed tbe residue of the secretion is transformed into a 
resinous, viscous mass, which is very sticky. There is no doubt in my 
mind that the viscous substance formed in this way is not a smelling 
mucus, as Wolff by a very far-fetched explanation, which is untenable 
for many other reasons, would have it, but forms the cement with 
which the nests and many other things are welded together. 

What is still too little known, however, is the manner in which a 
genuine phylogeuetic evolution converts this gland cement gradually 
into spun threads. The pasteboard of Lasius fidiginosus Latr. is very 
rich in wood dust or earthy matter and very poor in cement, so that it 
is very brittle. There is a drawing of it in my Fourmis de la Suisse, PI. 
II, figs. 32 and 3.3. The pasteboard which JAometoiyum microcephalum 
Pz. manufactures in the innermost hollow of venerable but, neverthe- 
less, strong, handsome, hard, large trees, and which is also composed of 
wood dust, is somewhat less brittle. They make it in oaks, poplars, 
apricot trees, etc., in southeastern Europe. Mayr gives a drawing of 
it, taken from a photograph, in the Proceedings of the Imperial Royal 
Zoological and Botanical Society of Vienna, June 1, 1802, Vol. XLII, 
PI. V, fig. 7. A great many species of the genera Cremastogaster Lund 
and DoUclioderus Lund build only pasteboard nests on the boughs of 
trees, aiul these nests vary very much in their nature. In some cases 
the pasteboard is harder and more brittle, resembling wood, as among 
the si)ecies just described; in other cases it is thinner and more elastic 
or flexible, but at the same time has much greater power of resistance, 
and is much more like paper or pasteboard, like thatof wasps. Cremas- 
togaster stollii Forel, of Guatemala, builds very peculiar galleries of 
pasteboard along the trunks of trees betw^een the projecting portions of 
the bark. They were discovered in these galleries by my friend. Pro- 
fessor Stoll, who communicated this circumstance to me. In Cremasto- 
gaster ranavalonw Forel, of Madagascar, the pasteboard of the inside 
of the large, round, tree nest, is thicker and more brittle; that of the 
outer portion is always thinner, more elastic, and finally, in the outer- 
most layers, even perforated, having a reticulate appearance, somewhat 
like loosely woven packing cloth. The nest of Cremastogaster ranava- 
lona^ is represented in my " Formicides de Madagascar" (from Grandi- 
dier's Natural History of Madagascar, Vol. XX, part 28, PI. VI, fig 4, 
4a, and 4&, and PI. VII). The nest of Bolklioderus bisjnnosus Oliv., 
which is composed of the seed hairs of a tree of tropical America (the 
wool treej Bomhax ceiba L.) woven together with gland cement, is very 
similar in appearance to the outer portions of this nest, but still more 
coarsely perforated and more net like. Fig. 18 represents a small piece 



490 ants' nests. 

of this substance microscopically magnified. Fib represents the vege- 
table filaments, which are only moderately dismembered, so that their 
structure may easily be seen; Cem is the ant cement, the color of which 
varies from yellowish to brownish, and which can be recognized by its 
shapelessness and its color; Mesh represents the empty meshes of the 
network. Thanks to the coarseness of the substance, which is, conse- 
quently, in an almost unscathed and unpulverized state, the ant cement 
can be better distinguished from vegetable building matter in this case 
than in the other kinds of ant pasteboard. 

Fig. 15 represents, in one-third the natural size, the photographed nest 
of Dolichoderus hituherculatus Mayr, of Bangkok, which was sent to me 
by the late lamented and well known turner, Mr. Heinrich Sigg, of 
Zurich. This nest is composed of a compact (not perforated) but 
fine-grained pasteboard, greatly resembling that of the nests of the 
common wasp ( Vespa germanica), but stronger. A section of the nest 
was taken oft" perpendicularly in order to show the structure of the 
interior. The nest is resting in its natural position on the bough where 
the ants had placed it. It can be seen how the small branches and 
leaves of the tree, glued together with pasteboard, are incorporated 
into the nest, and how the main bough serves as an axle to support the 
structure. It can be further seen how the labyrinth, constructed of 
pasteboard, is built more or less concentrically around the bough. 

Some species of the genera Camponottts {C. charfifex Smith, fraili 
Mayr, fahricii Roger, etc.), in South America, and Folyrhachis, in 
the East Indies, manufacture a very similar pasteboard. Fig. 4 repre 
sents a nest of Folyrhachis mmjri Roger, of Ceylon. The whole nest 
of most of the species of Pohjrhachu consists of a single cavity of the 
size of a walnut or of a hen's e.gg^ while the nests of other ants are, iov 
the greater part, divided into chambers and passages. The egg-shaped 
nest of PoJyrhachis nuti/ri, which I received from Major Yerbury, of 
Ceylon, through Mr. Wroughtou, stands simply like the cocoon of the 
silk-worm, on a leaf. The pasteboard of which it is composed resem- 
bles that of a Cremasiogasier nest, luit is very weak and fragile, l)eing 
made of vegetable particles slightly glued together with gland cement. 
A silk thread has never yet been discovered in any of them. The 
cement is in the form of yellow or brownish flakes and crosspieces, 
precisely like that of Dolkhoderus hi.spiiiosK.s (tig. 18, the colored parts), 
while the vegetable matter is entirely compact (without meshes) and 
more finely dismembered, though still recognizable in its structure (not 
pulverized); tiie walls of the nest are about half a milHmeter thick, 

folyrhachis scissa Roger, of Ceylon, builds its nest of exactly the 
same materials; but it is irregularly formed, and is attached to leaves 
rolled around galls, the crevices of which are closed with pasteboard. 

I have received similar pasteboard nests of Dolichoderus (iracilipes 
Mayr and of a species of Gremastoyaster fixed upon leaves, from 
Ceylon, through Major Yerbury. 



ants' nests. 491 

The nest of the PoXyrhachis jerdonii^ Forel whicli I received from 
Ceylon through Major Yerbury is very interesting. This species builds 
upon leaves small nests, the wall of which greatly resembles in appear- 
ance the shell of many Phryganeidce larvai. Pebbles, and esi)ecially 
small fragments of plants, are cemented together by a fine web or 
woven together, and form a rather soft and tough web-like nest wall 
of a bright greyish-brown color. Fig. 17 gives a microscoijic picture of 
this nest wall. We see here unmistakable small fragments of jjlants 
(Schol.) bound together in a web by peculiar silk threads (Gesp). 
These silk threads are found, upon a closer examination, to be of very 
irregular thickness, often branching, and in many cases issuing from a 
thicker crosspiece. Upon calling in the aid of the still more maguilied 
web of PolyrhacMs dives Sm. (also from the East Indies), in tig. 7, there 
can be no doubt that a viscous substance secreted by the glands, similar 
to that which we have seen used as glue by the ants previously 
described, is here simply drawn out into threads. In fig. 7 are seen 
the thicker crosspieces of a still more shapeless mass of cement and 
the more finely spun threads drawn transversely out of them. 

Polyrhachis dives, however, no longer needs any foreign material. It 
makes its nest wall out of pure silk web, exactly like coarse spun yarn 
or the web of the caterpillar. The web is of a brownish yellow, and 
is fixed between leaves, which are lined with it and bound together. 
Mr. Wroughton, of Poonah, India, sent me such a nest, simply between 
two leaves. 

A still finer, softer silk web, finer and thicker than the finest silk 
paper, very soft and as pliable as the finest gauze, though nuu;li thicker, 
of a brown color, is produced by Polyrhachis spinif/erCt Mayr. Fig, 16 
presents a microscopic picture of it. Here we find no more crosspieces, 
but only silk threads. They are, however, still irregular, of varying' 
thickness, spun across each other into a web. This web is fixed in a 
wonderful manner in the ground, where it forms the lining of a funnel- 
shaped cave, which is widened out into a chamber at the bottom. The 
honor of the discovery of this highly interesting nest is due to Mr. 
Wroughton; he found it in Poonah, India. Mr. L. Schroter made the 
somewhat schematic drawing of the nest, in its natural position, from 



' Polyrhachis jerdonii (workers) n. sp. 4| millimeters in length, short and broad; 
related to the rolyrhachis argentea Mayk, but still shorter, without silvery down, 
with a much less arched thorax sharply edged at the side, the abdomen sharply 
edged in front, with red mandibles, anteuuie, and legs (except the tarsi). The oth(U' 
parts are of a dull black, thickly and irregularly punctate-reticulate, and witli very 
fine, yellow, sparse, recumbent, and almost no erect hair. The head is wider than 
long, and broadens out very much behind. The clypeus is short, without tlaps in 
front, not carinate; the laminfe diverge behind. The scape of the short frontal 
antenna- is somewhat in the shape of an S, and hardly extends beyond the l)ack 
of the head. Scales between the spines, with a convex, emarginated upper border.

an original sketcli by Mr. Wrougliton (fig. 8). We refer tlie reader to 
tlie drawing and to the explanation of the plates. 

The large nest constructed in the foliage of trees, between the leaves? 
by (Ecophylla smaragdina Fabr., one of the most common ants of trop- 
ical Asia and tropical Africa, forms, however, the prototype of spun 
ants' nests. A great number of leaves are fastened together by a fine, 
white web, like the finest silk stuff. This web, apart from the color, 
has exactly the same appearance, both to tlie naked eye and under the 
microscope, as that of Polyrhachis sjnnigerd. The leaves are usually 
fastened together by the edges. The nest is large, and the large, long- 
very vicious, reddish to greenish worker ants live in it, with their 
grass-green females, their black males, and their whole brood. They 
form very i)opulous colonies in the branches of the trees. Fig. 10 repre- 
sents a portion of the nest of (EcophyUa smaragdina, with the web and 
the borders of the leaves which are fastened together. 

Now, how do the ants spin? This has, unfortunately, so far as I 
know, never yet been observed sufficiently closely. Not even the way 
in which the pasteboard of our European ants is made has been discov- 
ered. Las'tus fuliginosus has never consented to work before my eyes. 
At all events, the spinning of Q^lcophyUa, which works in broad day- 
light, ought to be the first to be seen, and, in fact, the only minute 
observations on this subject known to me, by E. H. Aitken, in the Jour- 
nal of the Bombay Natural History Society, 1890, Vol. V, No. 4, i>age 
422 ("Red ants' nests"), now lie before nie. 

Aitken saw how (EcopliyUa fastened two leaves together. A worker 
went to the base of the two leaves, at the point at which they began to 
separate, i)laced his hind legs, wliich are furnished with sharp claws, 
npon one of the leaves and diew the other leaf toward him with all his 
might with his upper jaw. If the distance was too great, from two to 
five ants chained themselves together for this task, each grasi)ing the 
body of one of the others, the first holding one leaf with his mandibles, 
the last seizing the other leaf with the claws of the tarsi. While the 
edges of the two leaves were held as close together as possible, simply 
by these chains of ants working side by side, with the application of all 
their strength in the utmost tension, as if by india-rubber bauds, Aitken 
saw other ants zealously engaged in binding the edges of the two leaves 
together with strong silk threads or ropes, which they si)un closer and 
closer together the nearer the leaves approached each other. When a 
sufficient number of leaves had been fastened together in this way by 
their edges, the whole was rendered Avaterproof by a com]>act silk web, 
and was divided into chambers and passages by a similar web, Aitken 
is a reliable and accurate observer. This highly interesting observa- 
tion of his is entitled to full credit. Only one thing is wanting to it, to 
wit, the information from what i)art of the body of the ant the silk 
thread issues. This must likewise be observed. 



ants' nests. 493 

Til my opiniou, however, there is no doubt that the silk thread of 
(Ecoph;/U<( and of the spinning species of Polyrkavhis, like the cement 
of the other species of Polyrhachis, many of Cremastogaster and Doli- 
choderus, Lasius fuliginosus, etc., is formed from the so-called mouth 
saliva, ajid most probably from the secretion of the glands of the upper 
jaw. The cells of these glands, at least in (Ecophylla, are large and 
numerous. 

6.— SYMBIOSIS AND KINDRED RELATIONS BETWEEN ANTS AND PLANTS. 

By symbiosis, in the more restricted sense, is meant the mutual serv- 
ices of two organisms living together, which, by a defensive alliance in 
the struggle for existence, are so dependent upon each other tliat the 
one can not thrive well without the other. The formation of si)ecial 
morphological characteristics is usually combined with genuine sym- 
biosis. There are, besides, all possible forms of im[»erfect symbiosis, 
displaying transitions to parasitism, etc., above all, however, those in 
which only one of the two organisms is really dependent upon the 
other. For example, the small beetles Lomechusa and Atemeles can not 
live without their ant host. On the other hand, the ant can exist very 
w^ell without such guests, and merely eats the secretion from the hair 
clusters of the beetles as a dainty (see Wasinann's elegant Observa- • 
tious on the Biology of the Guests of the Ants). There are, however, 
cases of still more imperfect, counterfeit symbiosis, where one organ- 
ism entirely ignores the other, and, lastly, casual relations which are 
erroneously regarded as symbiotic. 

The relations of certain ants to certain plants give rise to very 
peculiar forms of nests, of which we will speak briefly. 

(a) Genuine symbiosis. — Dr. Fritz Miiller, of Blumenau, South Brazil, 
has discovered the real relation of the Cecropia trees (the imbauba of 
the Brazilians) to Azteca instabilis Sxith. The ant genus Azteca 
FoREL, which is related to Liometopum Mayr, contains several Ameri- 
can species, but the biology of Azteca instabilis only is known. Prof. 
A. F. W. Schimper (The Varying Relations between Plants and Ants, 
Jena, 1888) has given us in his excellent work his ov/n observations in 
South lirazil, which substantially complete those of Miiller. 

Azteca instabilis lives only in the hollow trunks of certain species of 
Cecropia, especially Cecropia adenopus, which trunks are divided into 
chambers by transverse compartments ; but Schimper has discovered 
a species of Cecropia on the Corcovado, which never contains ants, while 
Cecropia adenopus and others, as soon as they have grown somewhat 
large (1 year old), are always inhabited by Azteca instabilis. The fol- 
lowing is now further ascertained : 

The pregnant females of Azteca instabilis seek out for themselves a 
certain very thin and soft spot in the trunk of the Cecropia, which 
always has the same situation in every internode, bore into it, and thus 
get into the hollow, where they deposit their brood, if they are not

attacked by parasites (ichneumon flies). The opening then closes, 
but is subseijuently .opened again by the worker ants. This thinned 
spot is an adaptation of the phint to the ant; it does not occur in the 
Cecrojrid which is free from ants (that is to say, the corresponding bud 
depression is not changed in texture and is not atrophied). On the 
underside of the stem of the leaf of Cecropia adenopHs and others is a 
peculiar hair cushion, which is constantly secreting albuminous, egg- 
shaped particles (JVIiiller's corpuscles). Tliese secretions are eagerly 
collected and devoured by the Azteca; they are one of their chief arti- 
cles of food (as(;ertained through Fritz Miiller). The Cecropia which 
is free from ants has none of ]\I idler's corpusck's. The species of (\cro- 
pia are mucli frecjuented in Brazil by the leaf laitting ants (species of 
Aitu) and are terribly injured by them, as has been repeatedly ascer- 
tained by Belt and others. All tliose which contain Azteca colonies are 
spared, because the vicious Azteca pursue the Atta furiously and drive 
them away. 

All this is well ascertained. The i)lant, by an undoubted adaptation, 
gives the ant food and lodging. The ant, in return, defends the plant 
from its worst enemy. This symbiotic relation did not, of course, arise 
all at once. Schimi)er found a Cecropia which is not inhabited by the 
Azteca, until later, and probably also less regularly. This Cecropia has 
also, it is true, thinned boring si)ots, but they are not formed until 
later, and it has not as yet any Miiller's corpuscles. Last year in Bul- 
garia 1 watched in oak woods and in old trees in general lAometopvm 
microcephalum Pz., of Europe, which lives in trees. The trunks of the 
trees are there, too, covered with ants, which attack fiercely all that 
approach them. We have not in Europe any species of Attn that cut 
leaves, but, on the other hand, we have so many more beetles and other 
insects which delight to destroy the old oaks. I was charmed at seeing 
near Aetos the finest oak forest that I have ever beheld, with real, superb 
giants. Almost all of them were inhabited by lAoinetopiim colonies, 
whose running workers covered all the trunks of the oaks. I have no 
doubt that these fierce ants, whose carnivorous habits Emery has 
described, drive away the enemies of the oak. The symbiotic relations 
of the Azteca and the Cecropia were probably formed from these sim- 
ple" relations. Liometopum lives only in trees; the trees, however, do 
not display the least adaptation to that ant. 

Belt and Schimper have further proved, as to Acacia splia'rocepliala 
WiLLD. and ^1. Hpadicigera Cham, and Schlecht, of Central America, 
that ants of the genus rsendomyrma Lund not only always live in the 
liollow thorns, but, owing to a peculiar adaptation of that plant greatly 
resembling that of the Cecropia, find sugar and albuminous food iii)on 
them. These two species of Acacia possess so-called extratloral necta- 
ries, which furnish the ants with sugar, ambon the points of their leaves 
Belt corpuscles rich m albumen (resembling the Miiller coi])uscles of the 
Cecropia), which supply them with albumen. Still a closer direct obser-

vation of tbe reception of the food by tlie ants is as yet wanting liere. 
The Acacias which are free from ants do uot possess these ])eculiar 
arrangements. 

(b) Imperfect symbiosis. — Belt has ascertained that the species of 
Fseudomyrma which inhabit Acacia thorns are fierce, warlike creatures, 
and keep every foe at a distance from the phint, including the leaf- 
cutting Atta, the forest destroyers of America. The adaptation of the 
ant to the plant is ascertained as soon as it is proved that the respective 
species always lives and can thrive only in the corresponding plant. 
This has recently been sufticiently demonstrated iu the case of Psendo- 
myrma Jlavidula and PseiuJomyrma. helti. With all this, however, it is 
not yet proved that all Acacias inhabited by ants coutribute anything 
on their ]>art to this arrangement. In fact, this is not yet i)roved in 
the case of many species; in others, it is very doubtful or imju^obable, 
because, on the one hand, there are many hollow Acacia thorns without 
ants (Mr. Wroughton has sent me such from India), and because, on 
the other hand, many species of ants of the genera rseuclomyrma, tSima, 
and Crcmastogaster frequently inhabit these thorns, and frequently 
make their nests in some other way. These hollow thorns with the 
round aperture, which the ants make use of, and which are very similar 
in ai)pearance to that of the gall in tig. 1, have been often depicted 
and we do not, therefore, think it worth while to rei)roduce them here. 
I found a thorn of Acacia fistula, which had been brought from Somali 
Land by Prof. C. Keller, and which was inhabited by Crcmastogaster 
chiarinii EMERY, divided inside by pasteboard into a few snuill cham- 
bers. In the case of Cremastogaster chiarinii Em., G. acacia Forel, 
and C. ruspoUus FoREL, there appears to be an adaptation of the 
ant to the plant. 

We must now speak of the celebrated pseudobulbs of the epiphytic 
plants of the genera Myrmecodia and Hydnophytum of the Sunda 
Islands. Fig. II represents, in half the natural size, the ijhotographed 
cross section of Hydnophytum montanum, which, with other magnificent 
specimens of this plant and of its relative, ^fynnecodia, which has 
often been sketched, was sent to me recently from Java through the 
kindness of my friend and colleague. Dr. Ad, Frick, of Zurich. The 
enormous bulb of this plant, which lives as a parasite upon trees, is 
always pierced by a hollow labyrinth, as represented by the cross sec- 
tion in our figure. Now, this hollow labyrinth, according to the obser- 
vations of Forbes, Beccari, Treub, and others, as well as that of 
Myrmecodia, is always inhabited by ants, which issue from little open- 
ings near the point of departure of the roots and fiercely attack every 
one who approaches, so that the natives are very unwilling to fetch 
these plants. Three species of ants, Iridomyrmex cordatus Smith, 
Cremastogaster deformis Sm., and Phodole jarana Mayr, were found 
in Myrmecodia and in Hydnophytum. While, however, Iridomyrmex 
seems to make its appearance always iu these plants only, Pheidole 



496 

javana is very widespread in the Suiida Islands, and makes its nests in 
other ways besides. Emery is, therefore, of the opinion, which is 
doubtless correct, that Pheidole merely robs the nests of Irldomyrmex 
occasionally and is not adapted to the plant. On the other band, 
Emery regards Cremastog aster deformis as the constant guest of the 
Hydnophytum. In all the Myrmecodia and Hydnophytuni bulbs that I 
received in alcohol through Dr. Frick there was a colony of the smaller, 
darker Javanese variety of Iridomyrmex cordatus Smith ( Var. Myrmc- 
codke Emery), including males, a few pregnant females, and numerous 
larvjx3 and pupa*. All the specimens of the plant had the same hollow 
labyrinth, looking like a nest built by ants. It must be added that the 
genus Iridomyrmex is very closely related to Azteca and Liometopnm, 
but comprises many species which build nests of earth. 

Now, Treub has ascertained (Annals of the Botanical Garden of 
Buitenzorg, Vol. VII, 18SS, p. IDl) that Myrmecodia raised from seeds 
in hothouses and in the botanical garden of Buitenzorg develop the 
whole hollow labyrinth in their bulbs, to complete maturity, without 
the presence of ants, just as well as those which, in a state of freedom, 
possess ants. At the same time the jilants thrive admirably. This 
proves that the labyrinth is produced by the i)lant, and not by the ants, 
though Beccari repeatedly found severed bundles of vessels in the com- 
partments. Treub has, consequently, resorted to other attempts at an 
explanation, and has regarded these singular cavities as the breathing- 
organs of the plant, and connected them with the interior irrigation of 
their web (the compartments have a very watery web), which, in view 
of the epiphytic situation of the plant upon trees with little foliage, is 
I)lausible. My own opinion, however, is that Beccari's observations 
are correct, and that the ants lend their aid by connecting some of the 
cavities by bored passages, as the natural cavities do not all appear to 
me to have a natural communication with each other, such as the ants 
require. Furthernu)re, the founders of the colony, the mother females, 
must first bore in. At all events, only the adaptation on the part of 
the ant is well ascertained — that is to say, in the case at least of 
Iridomyrmex eordatns^ which finds its exclusive, beautiful, and secure 
dwelling in the plants of the genera Myrmecodia, Hydnophytum (and 
Bischidia'i). Botanists say that these plants furnish no special food to 
the ants, at least nothing has been found corresponding to the Midler's 
corpuscles of Cecropin. Since, however, most of the Dolhlioderi keep 
no plant lice, but lick up the secretions of plants, or devour insects, a 
closer investigation of the mode of feeding of Iridomyrmex cordatus 
would probably bring some interesting facts to light. Besides, Treub's 
observations do not prove by any means that the plant does not form 
the labyrinth for the purpose of serving as a dwelling for the ants. 
The fierce inmates certainly afford it protection against its enemies. 
We must investigate, as S(>]iim])er did for Cecropia, whether there are 
kindred species of plants, not inhabited by ants, with or without similar 



i 



ants' nests. 497 

labyrinths. It remains surprising enough, in spite of Treub's later 
explanation, that so small a plant forms such a colossal bulb, with such 
cavities, to which a particular species of ant has so evidently adapted 
itself. It seems to me that the i^ossibility of an adaptation on the part 
of the plant can not yet be decisively denied, and that we should await 
further investigations into the biology of Iridomyrmex cordatns and 
Cremastogaster deformis. The fact that in the botanical garden at 
Buitenzorg Myrraecodia thrives without Iridomyrmex (Treub) proves 
nothing, because, in the first place, the conditions of the struggle for 
existence are entirely different there from those of the primeval forest; 
and, in the second place, because other ants frequently take possession 
of tlieir dwellings in the Myrmecodia bulbs, aud act as their represen- 
tatives. Treub found no dangerous foes of JMyrmecodia in the botanical 
garden, but in the forest it can be eaten or otherwise destroyed by 
mammals or other animals which are kept at a distance by the ants. 
Skepticism is necessary and good, but denial and rejection are not 
good without sufficient reasons. 

In a shrub in Borneo, Clerodendron Jistulosian Beocart, Beccari 
constantly found a Colohopsis, whicli Emery has named Gidobopsis 
clerodcndri. Here the plant, which, like the Ceeropia, has hollow inter- 
nodes, likewise forms a round attenuated spot in its walls, which is 
bored through by Colohopsis, and serves it as a door. The ])lant also 
possesses innumerable extrafloral nectaries (that is to say, glands pro- 
ducing a sugary liquid, which lie, not in the flowers, but in other 
places). Still, I am not yet entirely convinced, in this case, that there 
is an adaptation on the part of the idant, because the species of the 
genus Colohopsis, so far as hitherto known, are shy and cowardly, and 
would, consequently, furnish no protectors to the plant. The similar- 
ity of the shape of the head of the soldier of this species seems to me 
to indicate that he stops up the round opening of the nest in the stalk 
of the Clerodendron, with his head, in the same manner that the 
soldier of our European Colohopsis truncata stops up the door of his 
wood nest. All investigations on this subject, as well as on the ant's 
mode of feeding, are stilf wanting. 

There are, besides, a number of similar incomplete or doubtful rela- 
tions, noticed esijecially by Beccari, as, for example, that of the i>alms 
of the genus Korthalsia to Componotus liospcs Emery and korthdlsicv 
Emery; that of plants of the genus Triplaris to various ants which 
inhabit their stalks, etc.; but minute investigations of them are still 
wanting. The future will yet bring us many surprises. 

(c) Casual relations. — We have already become acquainted with these 
in that kind of nest in which the ants make use of natural cavities. 
Hollow acacia thorns are also frequently used as dwellings by ants 
which elsewhere make their nests in an entirely different way. Thus, 
Mr. Wronghton once, in an excei)tiona.l case in India, found Sima nigra 
Jerdon living in an acacia thorn.

7.— compound nest.s. 

Ill the Communications of the Swiss Entomoh)gical Society, Vol. Ill, 
part 3, 1860 (Observations on the habits of l^olenopsin fuf/ax), I first 
calh'd attention to the fact that two hostiki species of ants can live in 
nests which are regularly intercalated. In my "Fourmis de la Suisse" 
(1874), I showed that such relatnuis occur very freciuently and more or 
less accidentally among many species of ants, especially under stones 
tliat are well adapted to nests and greatly in demand; wlide, in tSolen- 
opsis fugax Latr., "double nests" form a very ordinary, in fact, the 
most ordinary, occurrence, at least in our meadows. Wasmann (The 
Conii)Ound ISests and Mixed Colonies of Ants, Miinster i, AV., 1891, 
Aschendorff's) has corroborated and supi)lemeiited my observations on 
this subject. Instead of the name "double nests," used by me, he has 
introduced the more correct expression "compound nests" (to be trans- 
lated into French by "nids composes"). In fact, these nests are not 
untrequently threefold, and even fourfold — that is to say, the nests of 
from three to four difi'erent and hostile species of ants are built into 
each other, without, however, having any open communication with 
each other. If the partitions are destroyed, war ensues immediately. 
The worker of Holenopfih fuga.r is a puny, yellowish ant, hardly 2 milli- 
meters in length, but the females grow to an imposing size, and look 
like giants by the side of the workers. This species is in the habit of 
digging its nests in the thick walls of the nests of the ants of the 
larger species, and in such a manner that,wheiever there is room, large 
halls are constructed (fig. G, S), in which the females and the males are 
comfortably lodged with their large pupa? and larva', while small pas- 
sages connect these halls. Extremely small passages, not visible in the 
figure, afford the workers exclusively admission to the chambers of the 
host ant (fig. (J, Foi). According to my observations and those of 
"Wasmann, Solenopsis fugax lives like a thief and little robber, at the 
expense of its involuntary host. The little workers make their way 
through extremely small passages to the pupa and larva heaps of the 
large ants and devour them from underneath without being seen, thanks 
to their small size. They also devour openly the forage supplies, as 
well as the dead and sick individuals, of the larger species (mostly 
Formica fusca L., but also Formica riifa, F. pratensis, F. f>anf/uinea, 
Poli/ergns rufcsceits, Lasius niger, etc.). 

Fig. () reijresents a fragment of a. double uest of Formiva fusca and 
SoJeuopsis fugax from the Zurich Mountain. By means of dissolved 
shellac, which I jwured upon the nest in fine weather, and then allowed 
to dry, I succeeded in making it firm enough to be able to take it out 
without injuring it. The fine-grained, polished interior walls of the 
i^olcno2)sis cavities are seen, in contrast to the coarse-grained and more 
spaci(ms Formica chambers. As the ants take up the moist earth with 
their mandibles in the form of small lumps, and then work it into shape 
with their jaws and forelegs, in order to construct their masonry with 



ants' nests. 499 

it, and as, moreover, the large Formica works with much coarser parti- 
cles than the puny l^olenopsis, the different character of the walls is at 
once explained. 

I have already explained the frequent occurrence of imperfect, more 
accidental compound nests of other species of ant, by ascribing- tbem 
to the acquisition of favorable localities, especially the underside of 
stones. From this competition frequently arise very murderous under- 
ground wars, which I have often watched. 1 have noticed closely, in 
glass apparatus, how they are carried on. The ants mine toward each 
other. A battle begins where their work happens to meet. The con- 
queror forces his way into the gallery of the coufpiered. The latter, 
however, hastens, after he has retired a few millimeters or centimeters, 
as tlie case may be, to stop up his gallery thoroughly with earth. The 
victor does not then, by any means, always succeed in again finding the 
entrance to it, but, in many cases, mines by the side of it, and thus 
partial interlappings of the nests arise. The galleries of ^Solcnopsia 
fuf/a.r are often broken through by the large ants. The little robbers 
are, however, in the first place, very courageous and combative; and, 
in the second place, they know how to mine rapidly and how to barri- 
cade rapidly, and by this means to make a skillful use of all the parti- 
tions, as I have been enabled to observe directly in the glass nest. 
The digging and fighting spirit is at its highest pitch among the ants 
in the first half of the summer, when the nests have to be enlarged for 
the brood. It then ceases, and truces follow ; in the autumn there is 
abundant space for all, and peace prevails. It is not without reason 
that the females and males of Solenopsis fugax do not swarm until Sep- 
tember, when the swarming time of their host ants (J uly= August) has 
long been past. They can then, in spite of their size, go to the upper 
surface of the nest and swarm undisturbed, as I have seen myself, 
whereas they could not have done so earlier without great danger. 

A peculiar variety of the compound nest is formed by the dwelling 
of the guest ant Formicoxenus nitidulus Nyl., with Formica rufa and 
Formica prafcn.sis, which I first discovered in a fragmentary condition, 
and which Adlerz subsequently found and described more fully. For- 
micoxenuH hunts the large Formica., and even follows it up closely 
throughout its changes of abode, as Wasmann first noticed, and as I 
have verified. By Formica., on the other hand, it is merely tolerated 
and superciliously ignored. The peaceable guest constructs in the 
walls of the nest of its large host ant little chambers and i)assages, 
which are, however, only imperfectly closed, and open freely into the 
chambers of the Formica. In these little chambers lie the brood of 
the Formicoxenus. The Formicoxenus' s mode of subsistence is still

The mixed colonies of the slaveholding ants and parasite ants {Poly- 
ergus rufescens Latr., Strongylognathus testaceus Schenk and S. huberi 
FoREL, Anergates atratidus Sciienk, Xenomyrmex stoUii Fokel) have 



500 

nests which always display tlie architecture of the working ant (slave 
or host), and have no further interest for us here. When Polyergus 
rufescens seizes Formica rufibarhis and keeps it as its slave, its nest 
resembles a larger nest of that species ; if, on the other hand, it enslaves 
Formica fusra, its nest looks like the nest of Formica fu-wa, because 
the so-called slave or auxiliary ants are the only builders. 

The case appears to be somewhat different in the rare, natural, for- 
tuitous mixed colonies [Formica pratensis or irimcicola or exsecta, svith 
Formica fusca; Tapinoma erraticnm with Bothriomyrmex meridional is) 
discovered by me (Fourmis de la Suisse), as well as in Formica san- 
guinea Latr., which almost always keep slaves, but notwithstanding 
also work themselves. Here the nest assumes a mixed architecture, 
as both si)ecies of ant work on it, each in accordance with its instinc- 
tive art. And yet they do not interfere with each other. Each species 
understands how to combine its work harmonionsly with that of the 
other, although the methods of the two are often very different, as, for 
instance, with the mason ants, Formica fusca and Formica pratcnsis, 
which work more like carpenters with their little branches and cross- 
pieces. Fusca unites the wooden rafters of pratcnsis by means of moist 
earth, and the whole lasts very well. I have also caused many artificial 
mixed colonies to be founded between Formica sanguinea and F. pra- 
tensis, etc., have even discovered naturally established colonies of these 
two latter species, and have investigated their mixed architecture. 

9.— MIGRATORY NESTS. 

Belt (The Naturalist in Nicaragua, 1S74) was again the first to dis- 
cover the hitherto -unknown nest of the American migratory ants 
[Fciton). He found in the forest an immense ant ball, from wliich all 
the robber columns issued, and in which all the brood lay. Here was 
a genuine nomad nest, a living nest without a house. Sceptical as we 
ha<l been with regard to the other discoveries of the genial Belt, we 
remained so respecting this one, too, until I succeeded, in the year 
1885, in interesting Fritz Miiller's younger brother. Dr. Wilhclm Miil- 
ler, who was residing at that time at Blnmenau with his brother, in 
this question. Dr. W. Miiller has published the results of his very 
interesting observations in the tirst volume of Kosmos (1886, p. 81: 
Observations on Migratory Ants). That which bears upon onr subject 
may be summed up as follows: The larger species of Ecifon, which have 
eyes [hamatum F., foreli Mayr, quadriglumis IIalid. [=^legionis Sm. 
=^lugubre Eoger], etc.) do not build or excavate any nests. They live a 
wandering life and merely occupy with their extremely numerous colo- 
nies spacious, naturally sheltered places, such as hollow trees or shrubs, 
in which they live rolled up together in immense clusters (one cluster 
of ants and brood, measured by Dr. W. Miiller, which did not compose 
half the colony, measured in an etherized state 5,000 cubic centimeters). 
Thelarvic and pupie first collected by Dr. W. Miiller and examined by me 



ants' nests. 501 

lie at liberty among- the auts, and are carried by them. The robbing 
expeditious are undertalien in the daytime, and the booty is carried to 
the migratory nest, where it serves chiefly as food for the larvne. 
When one locality has been sufficiently pillaged the whole colony 
migrates to another resting place. These latter migrations with bag 
and baggage, that is to say, with the brood, take ])lace exclusively at 
night. 

Far less is known about the nests of the blind species of Eciton and 
the entirely blind migratory ant genera Dorylus and ^Enictus, whose 
workers had previously, like the male oi Eciton {labidus), been classed 
as separate genera (T</j?/tto^owe West w. and Typhlatta Smith), because 
their connection with the previously described males was i)ot yet 
known. I have myself seen Dorylus juvencnlus, at Gabes, Soutli Tunis, 
hunting under ground. Tlie winged males of Dorylus jiivenculKs Fab. 
[badms Geest.), Eciton hetschJcoi Mayr, and JEnictus wroughtonii 
FoREL have been seen creeping out of the ground in company with 
workers and flying away. The very nest of Dorylus helvolus was dug 
up by Trimen, who found the female. Nothing more definite, however, 
is known. Are the plundered nests of other ants used for the moment 
as migratory nests? Are there here nocturnal migrations, too, and not 
robbing expeditions only? The future must tell us. At all events, 
judging by the observations made up to this time, including my own, 
Dorylus and JEnictus appear to i^refer the neighborhood of human 
habitations, and to fight under ground with other ants. 

10.— ROAD BUILDING. 

Certain European smts, Formica rvfa, F. pratensis, and Lasiusfuligi- 
nosus, build genuine roads in our meadows. The finest and best finished 
are those of Formica pratensis De Geer. A meadow, as has already 
been said, is a primeval forest to the ants. If the ants are like Formica 
pratensisj rather large, and if they are compelled, like that species, to 
drag home all kinds of timbers as building materials, as well as animal 
booty, a meadow, which otherwise furnishes them with the finest hunt- 
ing grounds, presents terrible obstacles. Formica pratensis is awk- 
ward; we need only notice what inexpressible difticulty it has in 
making its way with a load through the thicket of blades of grass in a 
meadow, how constantly the load is getting wedged between them, and 
what incredible patience and perseverance the insect displays in the 
effort to go forward to understand the object of the roads. The road 
building of Formica pratensis presents one of the most wonderful dis 
plays of animal instinct that I know of. Several such roads radiate with 
great regularity from one of the larger nests of this species lying in 
a meadow ; I have counted from three to eight and even twelve of them 
(so large a number is rare and occurs only in the case of very large 
nests). It can be seen that these roads lead mostly to trees or shrubs 
on which the ants climb up in multitudes in order to milk the plant 



502 ANTS* NESTS. 

lice. The road itself is kept very clean, is from 2 to 4 centimeters in 
width, and is made more or less concave laterally. Not only is no 
movable object alloAved upon it, not only is it kept always clean and in 
good order, but the ants, with the expenditure of incredible toil and 
strength, saw oft' with their mandibles every blade of grass that 
attempts to grow in the road, as they previously sawed oft" all those 
which Avere in existence when it was first constructed. Where the 
tufts of grass are too thick and strong, they go around them, it is true; 
but the roads usually run comparatively straight to their destination. 
Many of them are gradually lost in the grass; but as a rule they can 
be followed to a distance of 20, 30, 40, and in many cases 50 meters 
from the nest. One must Avatch long, closely, and above all in the 
spring, to see and understand the road building, and to avoid the 
impression that the road, as certain authors have thought, comes into 
existence of itself through the footsteps of the ants. These roads are 
very luimerously frequented. All the building materials and forage 
are lirst dispatched to the nearest road, so that they may be carried 
comfortably from there to the nest. As Formica pratensw has very 
defective powers of smell, and is not skillful in finding its way, the roads 
are also of great advantage to it in this respect. There are only two 
directions on them, and it is no longer compelled to search laboriously 
for the right way. It can be seen, too, how rapidly and confidently the 
ants move to and fro on their roads, in contrast to their behavior in the 
grass. (Compare Forel: Collections of Swiss Zoology, Vol. lY, No. 4, 
1888.) 

The agricultural ants of Texas {Pogonomyrmex barhaUcs Smith, P. 
molefaciens Buckley) make a large clearing around their nests, accord 
iug to Lincecum and MacCook, and numerous roads, in addition, by 
sawing off' the blades of grass, like our Forink-a pratensin. 

11.— REVIEW— THE ANT WORLD— LANDSCAPE TYPES OF THE ANTS' 
NESTS— POLYCALIC COLONIES. 

Even among us in Switzerland, a close investigation of the meadows, 
the dry declivities of the mountains, the clearings of the Avoods and 
thickets suffices to show us speedily that almost everything is invaded 
by the structures of ants. Where there are no actual nests there are 
underground passages and galleries, open roads, covered ways, or, at 
least, the inhabitants of neighboring nests, who are scouting around 
and contending Avith one another for the possession of the jdants con- 
taining ]dant lice and cochineal kermes, of the trees, the flowers, and 
the insect plunder. I have even seen young birds Avhich had just 
slipi)ed out of the nest killed and devoured by Formica prateitsis in 
spite of the frantic rage of the parent birds. The ants certainly, no 
less than men, fancy themselves the lords of creation, for, thanks to 
their social organization, their numbers, and their courage, they have 
few foes to fear; their most formidable enemies are always other

THE BVOLUTIOK OF MODERN SOCIETY IN ITS 
HISTORICAL ASPECTS.^ 



By R. D. Melville. 



The key to the enigma of the luiiverse is found in the doctrine of 
evolution. Far from being the purely modern theory, as whi(;h it is so 
generally regarded, it is merely a redevelopment of the theory of a 
certain school or system of Brahman philosophy— that of Kapihi, which 
dates from at least live hundred years before Christ. This system 
"assumes the existence of a primordial matter from all eternity, out 
of which the universe has, by successive stages, evolved itself" So 
our theory of evolution is no new idea alter all, though perhaps much 
more definite and particular than that of the Eastern philosopliers. 

To the physical, animal, vegetable, and even mineral worlds, the doc- 
trine of evolution equally applies, and its significance is not confined 
to a necessary connection between the terms "evolution," "man," and 
"monkey," so often nowadays found unalterably associated in the 
minds of the ignorant. The doctrine is a fundamental conception of 
all science— mental, moral, and physical. 

In the last of these divisions, viz, physical, with which our subject 
starts, from the Amoeba, the lowest existing form of animal Hfe (the 
single-celled protoplasm), to the human being, the highest existing 
development of protoplasmic organism and the most complex and com- 
plete creation in nature, all is the history of evolution. The history 
of the individual, with which our inquiry more particularly deals, is a 
particular example of the universal history of the human family— the 
story of the evolution of mind. And the story of mental evolution is 
the history of the evolution of morals. 

As we run up the scale of organism, passing from the simple to the 
more and more complex, we are forcibly struck by the at once close 
connection and yet wide separation between mere animal and human 
life. Organically and lihysically the same, the separation lies in that 
Tuental constitution, using the term in a higher and more strictly philo 
sophical sense. Yet, where the physical ends and the mental begins is 
impossible definitely to determine.

508 EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY. 

It is the history of that meutal constitiitiou in its development that 
we propose here to trace iu its general aspects. That history is the 
story of the evolution of society. 

To trace the evolution of society is to trace the growth of mind sub- 
sequently to the evolution of the individual. Our task, however, is 
somewhat easier than it has been in the earlier stages of our inquiry. 
We have larger facts and stronger evidences, M'hile the periods of tune 
to be considered are infinitely more adapted to the grasp of the ordi- 
nary mind. Instead of dealing with thousands and tens of thousands 
of years, as ciphers, we work with centuries and decades. We employ 
analysis, synthesis, and criticism; but our materials are larger. We 
do not require such minute analysis, such exact synthesis, or such crit- 
ical discrimination as were necessary in earlier investigation. 

Society, as we shall use the term here, must be understood in its 
widest significance — that aggregation of bodies of individuals, which 
bodies in themselves constitute a "society" (in a secondary sense), a 
"polity,'' or a "state." Each of those secondary societies or states, 
which go to form the widest conception of society as a whole, are, in 
our enlarged subject, as the individual is to the commuinty in which 
he is placed. We said that the individual was the highest poiu t reached 
in the evolution of organism. Society as a whole is the highest point 
attained in the evolution of the individual, which is merely a further 
stage in the evolution of mind. 

Dr. II. D. Traill, whose name must be familiar to all in the field of 
intellectual investigation, says: "Every civilized society is in the 
nature of an organism, the shape and direction of whose evolution 
depends in part upon the action of internal forces and iu part upon 
the influence of surroundings." The fundamental principles of evolu- 
tion—" struggle for existence, adaptation to environment, survival of 
the fittest"— all apply here, just as to the individual animal life. 

The study of evolution in all its branches is the study of history; 
but history of different kinds. The study of the evolution of society 
is history in its highest and truest sense. It is the study of man in his 
advance from barbarism to civilization, from civilization to culture, and 
of the principles and institutions which have aided his upward march 
and developed his present character. In it we read the story of prog- 
ress. We see it, to use the common but appropriate metaphor, like a 
little spring, bubbling up from the rocky soil, ever in danger of being 
dried up. It moves on — a tiny rivulet — whispering and gurgling, yet 
ever enlarging as it goes. The rivulet becomes a stream; the opposing 
pebbles become great stones; the stream grows to a river, a great vol- 
ume of water, deep, strong, and irresistible, cutting out channels for 
Itself, overcoming all obstacles, leaping, circling, and falling, till, as 
Kingsley puts it — 

Strong and free, strong and free, 
The flood-gates are open ; 
Away to the sea, 



EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY. 509 

and the tiny livnlet, swelled to a mighty river, " loses itself in the 
infinite main." It is diflQcnlt for ns to realize that the man of the pres- 
ent day — the bridger of ocean and air, the transcendental stndent of 
the infinite, the scientific explorer of the universe — is " the selfsame 
being, the same in form, in mind, in destination, as the poor, creeping, 
untutored savage who ages ago, in his weakness and ignorance, looked 
upon the little earth around him as the whole of creation, upon the 
ocean as he knew not what, reaching he knew not where; and who 
stood gazing with mingled fear and admiration as the fires of heaven 
alternately rose and set, glimmered, and faded away." 

This is the conception of man — the individual, the protoplasm of 
society — with which we enter upon our investigation; in the present 
instance, a mere sketch. 

Originating in the individual, society is rei)resented in its first stage 
by the family. This, as we know, formed the basis of the Hindoo com- 
munity, the (Irecian State, the Roman State; and we have analogous 
evidence to prove that it was the foundation of all other earlier com- 
munities besides. This was society in its patriarchal stage. 

In our present investigation it is advisable to proceed upon certain 
definite lines. We shall better attain our object now by tracing, by 
general indication, the gradual growth and development of manners, 
customs, religion, laws, industry, arts, learning, literature, scientific 
knowledge, and institutions. These, in the order enumerated, I con- 
ceive to be the outcome of social evolutiou. In its earliest stage — the 
patriarchal — only the first two or three of these characteristics existed 
or could exist in any definite form. Manners, customs, and religion, in 
however crude a form, exist wherever we have the nucleus of a society. 
Laws, as such, were a later development, their jdace in early comnnmi- 
ties being filled by custom — an arbitrary code sometimes marvelously 
allied to natural justice, at other times subverting all modern concep- 
tions of that moral law. The rule of life at this period was, generally, 
"might is right," the only rule practicable in an age when, according 
to the philosopher Hobbes, all men were in a state of hostility to each 
other, and each man took as he was able, by the strength of his arm. 

The nature and general treatment of our subject enable us to pass 
over the first beginnings of anything like a concrete society, and take up 
the thread at that point where laws and commerce, being added to cus- 
toms, manners, and religion,- were beginning to mold the whole body of 
society into something like a definite form. Arbitrary customs, prim 
itive manners, religious forms and ceremonies are now modified and 
improved. The unwritten law of custom is now expressly stated as law, 
and the first real step is taken in the practical organization of society. 
We find this situation realized in Rome at the time of the republic, at 
and for some time after the publication of the famous Decemviral Code 
known as the Twelve Tables. At the same time intercourse with aliens, 
for sale and barter and exchange of commodities, begins to exercise a 



510 EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY. 

marked influence upon social development. From this point our course 
is clear. We can not enter into particulars; that is impossible here; 
neither can we trace, even in barest outline, the course of the history 
of the world and its peoples. It is, however, generally understood that 
the history of society — social, moral, and political — is the history of 
European peoples ; and of these the course of progress is traced in the 
history of a certain few. Not that we can exclude Asiatic, African, or 
American races from the conception of society as a whole, but only in 
so far as these have advanced a certain length, while our inquiry is 
from the lowest to the highest i>osition yet attained, we must leave 
these lagging societies behind, and follow that i>ortion of the human 
race in the van of the army of progress. Our course is marked by 
many grea't landmarks, impossible to be mistaken, and every one sig- 
nificant in a peculiar degree. These landmarks are social revolutions. 
A certain writer (Edgar Quinet, I think, but can not at this time verify) 
sai<l that "great revolutions are the jn'ominent and enduring landmarks 
on the highway of the world, far raised above all surrounding objects 
pointing the progress not of particular nations but of the human 
race." 

Our first halting stage is on the ruins of the Roman Empire. 

The social question and society as we understand it to-day had its 
rise in the feudal system. And this, for so long a net about the feet of 
the world, was yet a benefit in disguise of an evil adapted to the age in 
which it flourished. As snow enveloping the earth in a mantle of white 
renders all external things bleak, bare, and unpromising, yet under its 
cold covering keeps warm and living the seeds that, when the due time 
comes, will burst and beautify the face of nature, so the feudal system 
enveloped society for nine centuries in a cloak of darkness; yet under- 
neath it nourished tlie spirit and the principles which, when the time 
arrived, burst forth and blossomed into rational institutions and made 
the Avorld what it is to-day. But the feudal system had its rise when 
Rome had lost her greatness and been humbled in the dust; when the 
Roman character as much resembled the ancient conception of old 
Cato the Censor as an Anglo-Saxon of the Conquest resembles an Eng- 
lishman of the present day. 

When, in course of time, Roman conquests embraced every part of the 
then civilized world and every king or prince yielded obedience to her 
authority, then was the time that sealed her fate. The old Roman 
character was sapped and enervated by wealth and luxury. The 
Roman conquests were maintained by mercenaries, her public offices and 
funds were filled and controlled by aliens and self-seekers. Abandon- 
ing herself to ease, yet^^ith the lust of conquest still as strong as ever, 
she intrusted her rule to tlie hands of a few and watched the course of 
events. Her Eini)ire, spreading on every side, at last overbalanced 
itself. She was drawing her life from her extremities. As these fell or 
rotted away by coriuptiou she grew weaker and weaker. Her officers, 



EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY. 511 

left practically to their own discretion and resources, worked for tbeir 
own advantage. The rights of her people were one by one invaded. 
Taxes were levied, growing heavier as the luxury and vice of those 
in authority grew greater. At last all unity was lost, and the last 
scene of the last act came, liome tried to rise to the occasion, but her 
strength had left her. Barbaric hordes poured in upon her from every 
side and ingulfed her. "On the ruins of the splendid temi)le now 
stood the hut of the savage, and in place of the polished and once noble 
Roman now stalked the Ostrogoth, the A'isigoth, and the Saxon." 

In the fusion of the Roman and Teutonic elements the feudal system 
was born. The Roman Empire on its death bequeathed a precious legacy 
to the world — a mighty intellectual influence, a noble literature, and a 
system of law which changed the destiny of society. It is said that 
many people do more by their death than by their life. The reason is 
obvious. So it is with institutions and societies. Had Rome lived, 
her rapid degeneracy would have polluted the world to all time. But 
she died in time for her past greatness to be remembered and exalted 
and for her shame to be forgotten. 

After this the wave of progress swept over France and Germany and 
across the English Channel, till it found a barrier and a basin in the 
British Islands. In its course it left the places over which it swept 
damp and dreary, but with a freshly moistened soil fitted to produce 
great croi)S. 

From the eleventh to the seventeenth centuries Britain is spoken of, 
and truly, as "the keystone of history" and the battlefield of freedom; 
and, to quote from an anonymous writer of vivid style, "the march of 
religion, of liberty, and of improvement was - - - over the soil of 
Britain." 

The second great landmark in our course is the ISTorman ( 'OU(iuest; 
<jhiefly significant in its fusion of the elements which formed the char-, 
acter of a nation second to none in })o\ver and wealth and influence at 
any period of the world's history. This is no mere boast. The impar- 
tial observer can not fail to acknowledge the peculiar characteristics, 
partly due to circumstances, partly to environment, and largely to 
nature, which have enabled the British to win and hold an empire in 
comparison to which that of Rome almost sinks into insignificance. 
There was among the legacies bequeathed by Rome to the world one 
destined to have a greater influence upon its fortunes than all the 
others combined. This was Christianity, or the Church. 

It is understood, of course, that, speaking generally, all these i)ro- 
gressive influences worked through one great factor — knowledge. The 
progress of this agency was slow but sure. After the fall of Rome it 
was opposed by a vast wall of ignorance and barbarism, and for cen- 
turies was at work unseen. It attacked the foundations of the barrier, 
working silently, gradually making a passage, ever enlarging the same, 
and as the passage got wider the stream grew fuller and stronger, till 



512 EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY. 

at last the huge fabric, iinderminecl, came crashing to the ground, 
opening to view va' ""tas and expanses liitherto undreamed of. 

In the beginning of the ninth century Britain, in common with the 
rest of Europe, entered upon a long period of social darkness, which 
continued almost unbroken until the fourteenth century — we might 
almost say to the middle of the fifteenth century. 

During all this time scarce a ray of light broke through the dark 
mists of ignorance to throw ever so slight a light upon the chains of 
feudalism. 

This system was introduced into England by William the Conqueror 
in the eleventh century, priuiarily to preserve his own sovereign power, 
secondarily to secure national liberty, by putting a check upon the 
strength of his great nobles, who in wealth and followers might with 
some reason attempt to match their i)ower against that of the King. 
But in England the system, harsh as it was, never obtained the same 
complete ascendency as over the peoples of the Continent; never so 
completely obliterated the individual to the advantage of a select few. 
Even at that early period the prerogatives of the sovereign were hedged 
in by certain restrictions. For instance, after the Conqueror, we have 
what is known as the Charter of Liberties, granted in the year 1100 by 
Henry I expressly limiting the regal prerogatives, and declaring the 
liberty of the laws, the people, and the church. Further, it had as 
an end the repression or restraint of unlimited feudal rights amongst 
the nobles, where they tended toward cruelty or oppression. To run 
on a little way, and passing over the reigns of the unfortunate Stephen 
and the hasty but too late repentant Henry 11, and the chivalric Cceur 
de Lion, we meet tlie first great landmark in our own history after the 
Norman Conquest. Tliis was the reign of the infamous John, whose 
name is even yet a byword for cruelty and craft, scarcely less signifi- 
cant than that of Nero or Borgia. 

Through his reckless disregard of anything like rights, whether 
natural or granted by charter under the sacred seal of the sovereign 
oath, John brought about that which has been to our country what the 
Twelve Tables was to Eome, the Magna Charta — ''the foundation," to 
use the words of Livy in regard to the former, "of all law, both j^ublic 
and private." At this time, too, we note the meeting of the first national 
assembly of elected representatives in Britain, summoned by Stephen 
Langton, archbishop of Canterbury, at St. Albans. Its object was to 
reform the abuses rampant under the rule of John. It was based on 
the charter of Henry I, which we have already mentioned. The sphere 
of this paper does not allow us to enter into the details or terms of the 
Charta, beyond stating that they aimed at the restraint of feudal 
oppression, the impartial administration of justice, and the recognition 
of the right of every individual to the protection of the laws. No 
doubt, the system inaugurated by tlie Magna Charta was rude, unsci- 
entific, and incomplete; and further, it can not witli any truth be 



EVOLUTION OP MODERN SOCIETY. 513 

designated as a '' i^opular" victory, according to onr modern sense. Tlie 
barons at that time were tlie only "people." T ijustices they sought 
to have remedied, though aifecting high and low, still primarily afiected 
themselves. Their honor, or their power, was threatened by the sov- 
ereign's arbitrary dispensation or disregard of justice, whether coming 
directly to themselves or through their dependents. But the Magna 
Charta of 1215 is important, inasmuch as it was the source of what 
are at the present day the stable elements in the British national life 
and character — the unsubduable love of liberty, the system of limited 
monarchy, self-government, and universal representation. These are 
the characteristics which have gone to form that great unwritten and 
arbitrary code, the Britisli constitution. 

After this little digression we must go back and take up the thread 
we have dropped. The significance of what we have just been regard- 
ing will be evident, if not now, at any rate before we have finished. 

The tenth century found Europe enveloped in almost total intellec- 
tual darkness. Italy and Great Britain, destined (the first again) to 
become afterwards the home of the arts, sciences, and culture, at this 
time slept, overcome by pernicious fruits of servitude. Franco and Ger- 
many were, if anything, intellectually brighter. Here and there a faint 
gleam served to make the darkness visible. " Compared with the 
seventh and eighth centuries, the tenth," says Hallam, "was an age of 
illumination." Still, this chrysalis condition of society continued. The 
twelfth century shows, in France particularly, some sign of an awaken- 
ing mind. In this centurj^, literature — the index of the mental condi- 
tion — had its second birth. The chief sources of intellectual progress 
at this time were, as enumerated by Hallam, (1) the institution of 
universities; (2) cultivation of modern languages, followed by the nud- 
tiplication of books and the extension of the art of writing; (3) the 
investigation of the Eoman law; and (4) the return to the study of the 
Latin classics. These are due in large measure to the growth of what 
is known as scholasticism, originating, it is supposed, in the ninth, but 
more generally attributed to Eoscelin, of Compiegne, in the twelfth 
century. 

About this time the universities of Paris and Bologna were founded, 
and a little later those of Oxford and Cambridge. From these points 
the light of knowledge was diffused over the world till, from a few tiny 
glimmering sparks, arose in time a brilliant illumination. The dark 
clouds of ignorance and superstition were gradually melted and dis- 
persed as the strong sun of reason rose higher and higher in the intel- 
lectual sphere. 

This brings us down, in a very general way, to the beginning of the 
fifteenth century, the period known in history as the revival of learn- 
ing, and, a little further on, to our third great landmark in the road of 
social progress — the fall of Constantinople, in 1453, and its far-reaching 
effects, constituting what we understand by the Renaissance.

514 EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY. 

This period is iiiiportaut and signiflcaiit in tlie liistoiy of the evolu- 
tion of society. Europe now began to sliake oft' the fetters of ignor- 
ance. From this time onward progress is by leaps and bounds. 
Certain events contributed much to the general awakening of intelli- 
gence and inquiry. These were the momentous invention of printing 
by Gutenberg, of Strasburgj the discovery of America in 14:925 the 
voyage of Vasco da Gama in 1498, and, latest and greatest, the Eefor- 
mation of 1517. The Eeformation is our fourth landmark, another of 
our intellectual revolutions, and this brings us to an interesting and 
imi)ortant inquiry. We said a little earlier that what was destined to 
be the greatest inilueuce bequeathed by Rome was Christianity, to 
which we shall refer generally, since wo are dealing with Europe, as the 
church. For fifteen hundred years this power had existed, and now 
it asserted itself. Where during all this age of social darkness was this 
revolutionizing power 1 Alas! that I have to say it, like many another 
great and noble ]iower, debased, distorted, prostituted ! That which 
should have been to society through all this time what the pillar of cloud 
and fire was to the wandering Israelites, a guide and a support, was a 
snare and a pitfall. The churcb — religion — was made to serve as a cloak 
to worldly sin and ambition. For these ends, Avhile attempting to 
maintain an outward appearance of purity, it fostered superstition and 
ignorance. Till at last Luther arose, preceded, like the first and great- 
est of all reformers, Christ, by his forerunner, Erashius. This is the 
greatest and most significant of all our landmarks. It marks a mighty 
revolution, fiercer and more thorough than any succeeding ones. It 
was a mighty stimulus to intellectual growth and social development. 
Till now it had been the world and the church; from now it was the 
world with the church. 

A real society can only exist where the rights of every individual 
member as such are recognized and protected. Nor can this be until 
the individual has recognized his own position and his own rights. 
This was what the Eeformation effected. In Britain the despotic reign 
of Henry VIII, the feeble reign of Edward Vl, the bloody and bigoted 
reign of Mary, and the beneficial and epoch-marking reign of Elizabeth, 
all tended indirectly toward this result. The rapid growth of the spirit 
of liberty, and intolerance of opi)ression in the guise of sovereign care, 
is markedly manifest in our fifth great landmark and revolution — the 
overthrow of the monarchy in Britain and the establishment of the 
commonwealth. We see liere, what we have not seen before this event, 
a i)Ower of combined action and unity among the people. This was 
what was required before they could ever hope to cox)e with hereditary 
individual or oligarchical authority. 

And here let us pause and look back over the rough and stony road 
we have come along. AVe see from our higher elevation and with our 
clearer vision the great exi)anse of time covered with the feudal mists 
of the Middle Ages; yet where we can distinguish anything at all we 



EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY. 515 

see men, as Campbell puts it, " Yoked to the brutes and fettered to the 
soil." We hear the ceaseless tumult of war, see from every point the 
lurid glare from burning homesteads, or the dead, black emptiness of 
devastated fields. 

Although we say that indirectly the feudal system was a beuefit to 
the world iu the end, yet, regarding it in itself, we can not but acknowl- 
edge its evil effects at the time of its greatest power. It tended to 
obliterate the individual ; to choke all spirit of independence, of pride or 
patriotism, in the people; to elevate a few at the expense of the many. 
What there was of pride or patriotism was rather a blind devotion to a 
particular head, and where the pride or patriotism of that head inclined, 
there the devotion of his servants followed. 

Yet the people themselves were to blame for this unnatural state of 
society. They, in common with their masters, were under the despotic 
rule of custom, styled by Pindar " King over all mortals." If they 
made no eftbrt to free themselves, it is not likely their masters would 
do it for them. 

Iu this connection we have Shelley's splendid lines, iu his Ode to 
Liberty : 

He who taught man to vanquish whatsoever 

Can he between the cradle and the grave, 
Crowned him the King of Life. Oh, vain endeavour! 

If, on his own high will, a willing slave, 
He has enthroned the oppression and the oppressor. 

Iu the Middle Ages, too, when life depended practically on the prod- 
uce of the soil, the constant warfare and feud formed an insuperable 
obstacle to social XDrogress. When the summer was far advanced, the 
air clear and warm, and everything giving token of the time when the 
face of the country should have been golden with ripe, waving corn, 
and the air melodious with the songs of the reapers, then perchance 
there would be a wide expanse of blackened fields and ruined home- 
steads. The lord's bugle had summoned his vassals from the plow, 
and the harrow lay rusting and neglected. 

lmi)rovement can only come Avhen men have time and liberty to 
think. I would especially emphasize the significance of the latter of 
these terms — viz, liberty. Prof. Sheldon Amos, in his treatise on the 
Science of Law, has very well expressed what I am desirous of impress- 
ing here. "It implies," he says, "rest, meditation, imagination, slow 
and steady culture of the faculties, combinations and associations for 
all vsorts of purposes, and especially that slowly formed belief in the 
certain power of carrying resolutions into action on which so much of 
human greatness depends. Liberty, in itself, is a negative term denot- 
ing absence of restraints; on its iwsitive side it denotes the fullness of 
individual existence." This privilege was, all the time of which we are 
treating, in the hands of a few secluded hermits — dead to the world, 
yet living factors iu its history. Under the protection afforded them 
by ignorance and superstition in the cloak of religion, these pursued 
their labors and their studies unheard, unheeded, and unseen. 



51 G EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY. 

Industries at this time there were noue, to briug the people together 
and let them feel "the beating- of the selfsame heart in each." War 
and religion were the only professions. Cultivation of the soil was 
often an impossibility; hence poverty and pestilence stalked every- 
where, feasting on thousands of victims. 

I hear even now the infinite fierce chorus, 

The cries of agony, the ceaseless groan, 
AVhich, through the ages that have gone before us, 

In long reverberations reach our own. 

* * * * ^ 

Is it, oh Man, witli such discordant noises, 

With such accursed instruments as these. 
Thou drownest Nature's sweet and kindly voices, 

And j arrest the celestial symphonies ? 

Yet there were, latterly, small communities, outside the power of the 
feudal lord, Avhich formed the nucleus of future towns. It is there we 
must look for all the intellectual advancement, for the theoretical and 
practical organization of society upon a basis more in keeping with 
man's mind and mission. Their growth was rapid and their influence 
proportionate. Little by little the conception of a state was altered 
from that of a sovereign, omnipotent and divine, fountain of all mercy 
and justice, and a people, a collection of atoms, whose iluty it was to 
support the sovereign in whatever caprice might lead him to perform, 
to that of a people, a collection of individuals, whose combined desires 
were represented and executed in the will and actions of a sovereign. 

This is the modern conception of society, and brings our view some- 
what beyond the point at which we last halted — the establishment of 
the commonwealth in Britain. 

From now our view becomes so extended that we must either restrict 
ourselves to a bare outline or swell our investigation beyond all 
proportions. 

European states now began to assume a more deflnite form. 8till 
they were far from agreeing with our present day conceptions of what 
a state should be. Louis XIV, in France, was rising to the height of 
his power. His subjects, carried away by enthusiasm and repeated 
victory, were devoted to him. But it was not a true devotion; it was 
a false enthusiasm. For all his magnanimity — and he had much — the 
people had no more iiower than before. Louis lavished gifts, encour- 
aged commerce and art, and rewarded men of letters. Yet all the 
power was vested in the King. Success depended on the King's 
favor and caprice. All these eflbrts were spasmodic and ill-timed; 
many were fruitless, and their failure but increased the general confu- 
sion. It was impossible that, in a period of constant warfare and con- 
tinual change, there could be any consistency or definiteness in the 
aims of society. The age of Louis XIV represents the state of Europe 
in the seventeenth century — an age of unrest, warfare, and diplomacy, 



EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY. 517 

yet we must say developmeut. The couditious then existing — the 
iutei riipted harvests, the overwhelming taxes, the constant drain upon 
the manhood of the countries, the capture and recapture of towns, and 
all the horrors, external and internal, consequent on war entered upon 
for the gratification of the caprice or pride of an individual — all tended 
toward a better and truer condition of society. Every additional 
impost, every new levy, was a step nearer the recognition by the people 
of their true position and their proper rights; toward drawing'^ them 
together in the bonds of social unity; toward the downfall of tyranny 
in the guise of custom. 

While the progress of society on the Continent was impeded by war 
and dissension, it was steady and uninterrupted in Britain, ^ot that 
we were without dissensions too. But our warfare was of such a nature 
that it tended to draw the i^eople together for common ends. The civil 
war of 1G42 and the revolution of 1688 were mighty factors in our own 
social history and that of the world at large. These were esseutially 
contests between the Crown and the people, between arbitrary power 
and individual right. And these events are of the greater significance 
in that they could ever have happened. The victory was there won by 
unity and the courage of the conviction of the goodness of the cause. 
For the time, all j)nvate or sectarian animosities were forgotten. 
Bishop, noble, squire, merchant, artisan, and plowman. High Church- 
men, Low Churchmen, Nonconformists, and Quakers, worked together 
for a common end — liberty, the inalienable right of each and all. 

While this was going on in Britain, Europe looked on askance. 
But it was only that species of half admiration and half fear with 
which the community regards an individual who is the first to venture 
to do what no one else would dare. Soon others will follow; it only 
needs exami)le. So it was in the seventeenth century. Hence the sig- 
nificance and influence of British history of that time. When the 
crisis was passed, and men once more allowed their petty jealousies 
and animosities to have sway, they found themselves upon a new foot- 
ing. They knew their own rights and the rights of the sovereign, and 
the limits of these. Moreover, they were flushed with victory and full 
of conscious strength. The effects were rapid. Towns arose, com- 
merce developed, industries increased, wealth multiplied, and comfort 
spread. Societies, associations, guilds, and councils began to exercise 
an influence, representing in miniature the theory of the state. 

In political government, too, a great end was achieved by more thor- 
ough representation. 

Under the new conditions, learning and culture began to thrive 
enormously. Britain took the lead in social progress, and she has ever 
since retained it. 

The eighteenth century is in Britain a record of intellectual and, 
with it, social progress. The barriers of custom and prerogative were 
ever falling before the conviction of natural right and equity. On the 



518 EVOLUTION OP MODERN SOCIETY. 

Continent i^rogress was much slower. But tlie crisis could not belong 
delayed. The dark and smooth surface of society but served to con- 
ceal the current underneath. 

Still waters ruu deep. 

The close of the eighteenth century marks the end of what is known 
in history as the ancient regime. It was signalized by the most drastic 
and, in its immediate eflects, the greatest social revolution we have to 
deal with. It was the bursting of the pent-up storm of misery. It 
was preceded by a fearful calm. Then the tempest broke out, relent- 
less and irresistible. It spared neither old nor young, father, mother, 
brother, sister, husband, wife, or child. It cared nothing for associa- 
tions and sentiments, the work of genius, or the toil of years. As the 
whirlwind swept across the country — shrieking as if in mockery liberte 
and egalite, it left in its track ruin and desolation. 

Robespierre, Danton, and Marat, like death angels, guided the storm, 
yet were powerless to control it. 

The Revolution did its work cruelly, but thoroughly. Every vestige 
of the old was swept away — king, crown, home, and kindred. Men 
could start afresh on a new system. The tempest of the Revolution in 
France reached Britain only as a great ground swell. Society there 
was agitated, l)ut nothing more. Ilad it been one hundred years earlier, 
I tremble to think what our country might have been to day. Kings- 
ley says, "The human race owes more to the eighteenth century than 
to any century since the Christian era. This may seem," he goes on to 
say, "to be inconsistent Avith my description of the very same era as 
one of decay and death. But, side by side with the death there was 
manifold fresh birth; side by side with the decay there was active 
growth; side by side with them, fostered by them, though generally in 
strong opposition to them, whether conscious or unconscious." 

Again, in another place, Kingsley remarks: " We shall find through- 
out the eighteenth century a stirring of thought, an originality, a 
resistance to circumstances, which would have been impossible had 
circumstances been the true lords and shapers of mankind. Had that 
latter been the case, the downward progress of the ancient regime would 
have been irremediable." 

Yet again, talking of the French Revolution, he says that one of the 
doctrines then specially proclaimed was that "in each man there is a 
God-given individuality, an independent soul, which no government or 
man has a right to crush, or can crush, in the long run." 

The eighteenth century drew to a close in storm and darkness. 
Society was moved to the roots — strained and torn. But when a new 
century dawned the clouds of revolution were dispelled before the sun 
of liberty, and all gave token of a glorious noon. And men were not 
mistaken. 



EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY. 519 

This brings us to our furthest and our highest point. From the 
height now attained we have au ahnost boundless view over the ages 
that liave gone before, and we can survey them with the tranquillity of 
the scientific observer. 

The progress of society, the gradual emancipation of the individual, 
the steady development of mind and resource, and uhe spread of their 
influences to all classes of society, had its active rise in the fifteenth 
century. By the seventeenth century the development had assumed 
marked forms and signally asserted itself. By the eighteenth century 
it had grown to proportions against which the old order of things could 
not possibly hold out, and it inaugurated the nineteenth century with 
a revolution of society more direct, drastic, and immediate, if not more 
thorough or momentous, than the Protestant Reformation. 

The political history of the present century — which is always the 
reflex of the internal social workings — is a recorcj of universal awaken- 
ing. This undoubtedly was hastened by jSTapoleon's vast attempt to 
restore despotism. The whole of Europe, upon which the influences 
we have been tracing had been long working, was roused into action. 
Napoleon staked the cause of despotism at Waterloo, and lost. Shortly 
before this Holland had shaken off the foreign yoke; Greece, once 
more, for a brief space, something like her old self, after Missolonghi 
and Navarino, regained her independence from the Turks; shortly 
after, Belgium was declared free; and, later still, we follow the noble 
efforts for freedom in Italy, under the patriot Garibaldi ; and we behold 
them crowned with success. Surely these events — revolutions in a sec- 
ondary sense — are deeply significant. They were the natural fruits of 
the forces at work from the earliest period of human history. 

The influences in Britain at this time were no less marked, though 
they were not characterized by the same violence. That stage had 
been passed two centuries before. The changes were of a semipolitical 
character, in which sense I mean that they more immediately concerned 
the people themselves than their relations with the rest of the world. 
Social and parliamentary reform formed the basis of the agitations. 
The immense increase of wealth and spread of knowledge had thrown 
open the roads to places hitherto jealously guarded. The common 
bond of individuality and natural freedom had been irrefragable. It 
was no longer mere birth that ranked before worth. Thus united, 
society became molded into a solid and clearly defined body. 

Intellectual progress in the seventeenth century was great; more so 
in the eighteenth. But the nineteenth century has surpassed all in the 
purity and clearness of its intellectual sky and the intensity of its 
intellectual sun. 

This is amply evidenced by the paramount importance attached to 
education and the universal desire for the same; the enormous increase 
and perfection of industries; the growth of vast cities; the extent of 
international relations, political and social; the spread of and height 



520 EVOLUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY. 

attaiued iu all the fields of liiglier iutellectual iuvestigatiou in science, 
art, and literature; in the current thought of the day; in all these 
questions now vexing and wearing us — social, religious, and economic. 

I have purposely refrained from doing more than mentioning the 
most outstanding points in our subject of investigation. In no place 
have I gone into particulars. Our field is so vast that our view can 
only be general. I might have treated the subject from a purely socio- 
logical point of view. But that might have been too technical and 
uninteresting; and besides, when we think of it, sociology is merely a 
generalization of the evidences of history. We have sketched, or at 
least indicated, the growth and influence of customs, manners, religion, 
laws, industry, commerce, science, literature, and art, and their respective 
points of beginning and ending. We have seen the human atom develop 
into the human unit, the single-celled social protoi)lasm grow into the 
complex and multiform organization of present society. In tracing the 
evolution of society we have traced the evolution of the individual; 
we have traced the evolution of mind. One fact must have been patent 
to us all along, and that is the measure in which the individual acts 
upon society and in which society reacts upon the individual. I know 
that I am throwing myself open to opposition when I say that the whole 
history of the human "race is a record of constant, though varying, 
advance. The world is working toward an end of self-realization; to 
this all is tending. Every revolution, every reformation, every change 
is a necessary step to this end. It is our destiny that impels us. 

The Avorld to-day has reached a position never hitherto attained. 
Our standards and conceptions of morality are higher and truer and 
our methods surer. Sin and vice, still exist; some say as heinous as 
ever. That is not so. Not only is there less sin and vice, but what 
there is is only equally heinous with that of past ages in that our higher 
standards and sensibilities are the more easily shocked. Our means of 
restraining vice and crime, of alleviating misery, and of securing hap- 
piness are more universal and efficient. 

All this is the outcome of our truer conception of man's place in 
nature and position inter se. 

If anyone doubts the truth of our conceptions and the actuality of 
things, he has only to look around upon the world of yesterday and of 
to-day to see the waste moorland converted into rich fields or thriving 
cities; to watch the busy throng of workers, all eager with what they 
may imagine to be their own concerns, but nevertheless each in his

Selfish, some will say! True, there is nnicli self-seeking, much selfish-

may litly close by quoting those spirit-stirring and appropriate lines of 
Campbell : 

Eternal Nature, when thy giant hand 

The wave upheaved and fixed the tremblino- land. 

When life sprang startling at tby plastic call, 

Endless her forms, and man the lord of all — 

Say, was that noble form, inspired by thee, 

To wear eternal chains and bow the knee? 

Was man ordained the slave of man to toil, 
Yoked to the brutes, and fettered to the soil. 
Weighed in the balance with a tyrant's gold? 
No, Nature has cast us in a heavenly mould. 
She bids no wretch his thankless labour urge, 
And, trembling, take the pittance and the scourge. 

Tyrants, in vain ye trace the wizard ring,. 
Ye can not limit Mind's unwearied spring. 



MIGRATION AKD THE FOOD QUEST: A STUDY IN THE 
PEOPLING OF AMElUCA.i 



By Otis Tufton Mason. 



THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE. 

Ill tlie struggle for existence our species lias waged a double contest, 
the one against decay, disintegration within the human body or the 
society; the other against destructive forces from without. 

The chief contest for the inner man has been to appease the insati- 
able cravings of liuuger and thirst. 

The chief contest for the outer man has been to resist the blistering 
rays of the sun, the biting frost, the pelting storm, savage beasts, and 
still more savage men. For this latter contest man created clothing for 
the body, the home for the family, the camp for the clan, the fortress 
and armor and weapons against the beasts and the enemy. 

The elements of activity in this double contest were:^ 

1. The exploitation of the earth for materials and resources. 

2. The transformations of materials and the subjugation of force. 

3. Transportation and conveyance, the carrying industry. 

4. Barter, commerce, and exchange, the pursuit of wealth. 

5. The arts of consumption and enjoyment. 

The activities just mentioned divide themselves into two sorts with 
relation to place — the stationary industries and the migratory activi- 
ties. We shall attend now only to the latter. 

MIGRATION AND ITS MOTIVES. 

By migration is meant intentionally or unintentionally leaving a spot 
and not returning to it. This term is frequently confounded with 
those movements throughout the year which have been called " the 
circle of activities," the ground covered being the sphere of influence 
or total culture area. This sort of orbital or annual movement has 
had much to do with those permanent migrations of which we are now 
speaking.

524 MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST. 

The law of tlie circle of employments and of permanent migration 
may be called the maxima and minima of effort — that is, men have 
always bestirred themselves the year round and moved about the world 
on lines and to places where there seemed to be promise of the great- 
est comfort and security for the least effort on their part. 

In this paper especial attention will be paid to this maxima and 
minima in relation to the food quest, though it will be seen that follow- 
ing this line conducts also to the best results in the other activities 
mentioned and to the supply of other needs. 

Migration is caused not by one motive, but by all possible motives. 
Collect all the inHueuces and wants that have actuated individuals in 
going about. These same, acting on a family, a set of men, a horde, a 
clan, a people, have caused migration. They have acted by compulsion 
and by attraction, from within and from without, through nature and 
through man. 

Taking these motives for change of habitation all in all, they may be 
sharply divided into two classes, the attractive and the repulsive forces. 
Some migrants are drawn, allured, enticed to move. They go because 
they want to; nobody compels them. They have in themselves the 
energy, the ambition, the vigor, the desire to go, and these are the 
peoples that have dominated the earth. 

Other migrants are crowded, driven, compelled to move. They are 
afraid or too weak to stay where they are. Such i^eople are cowardly 
or unfortunate, retrogressive, dying out. They shrink into the suburbs 
of the world. 

Uniting these concepts of attraction and repulsion with the notion 
of subjective and objective causes of struggle, we have a quadruple set 
of migratory forces working together or apart: 

A. Subjective motives, vis ab infra. 

1. Desire, hope, appetite, ambition, energy. 

2. Weakness, fear, aversion, cowardice. 

B. Objective motives, vis ab extra. 

3. Advantages, suj^plies, comforts, satisfactions, acting a fronte 

or a tergo. 

4. Discomforts, compulsions, failure of resources, a fronte or a 

tergo. 

Accidents, sui)erstition, calamities play their part with substantial 
causes in this composite set of motives. 

According to the laws of mechanics, bodies move in the lines of least 
resistance, with momentum proportioned to the vis a tergo. They have 
no souls, no desires; they do not move, but are moved. 

With animals and men the case is different. They move in a paral- 
lelogram of forces. 

1. In the lines of least resistance in front. 

2. In the lines of greatest pressure behind. 

3. In the lines of greatest desire within. 



MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST. 525 

4. Ill tlie lines of greatest pull, or attraction, or supply from without. 

5. In the lines of greatest effort or volition subjectively viewed. 
After all, it is the cheerful, hopeful migration, stimulated by desire 

and encouraged by propitious surroundings, allurements, and forces, 
that effects new cultures. Doubtless shipwrecked mariners, lost wan- 
derers, and outcasts have now and then left a hapi)}' thought or sngges- 
tion upon receptive aboriginal minds; but these random surf beats are 
not what Tennyson calls — 

The great waves that echo round the world: 
FOOD AREAS AND FOOD SUPPLY. 

The greater part of the earth's surface Avas sterile and repellent as 
abiding place to primitive man or to the living forms upon which he 
depended, to wit: 

The deep sea, out of sight of coastal plains and meadows. 

The arid deserts, barren to man and jjlant and beast. 

The mountain tops, then as how, inaccessible and unproductive. 

The frigid zones, above the lines of food and furs. 

The great plains and prairies, away from waterways. 

The dense forests, jungles, tundras, and swamps. 

But all of these were provocative of migration and long journeys. 

Both man and his purveyors had to walk at first in those terrestrial 
paths which had been marked out by Xature and provisioned for his 
journeys. By following the trails of supply he got into the green pas- 
tures and encamped by the still waters that invigorated him. It so 
happened that the trade winds and gulf streams were conterminous 
with the marine feeding grounds; that the inland rivers, bays, and 
lakes on which he could journey with greatest facility were the catch- 
ment basins of surrounding fertile lands and the feeding ground of 
innumerable creatures yielding food to him in largest abundance. 

The rich meadows and valleys were the debris of degradation. Their 
loam was once on the inaccessible tops of mountains and was only 
halting a little way on its journey to the great littoral feeding grounds. 
It was on this stream of dry land between mountain and shore that 
great herds of ruminants were developed, and to them early men were 
attracted for the easiest and most abundant means of support. 

The greatest natural food su^^ply for the least effort, with few excep- 
tions, was in the water. This saying is true for all the five elements of 
activity of which I have spoken previously, to wit : 

1. Exploitation. — The easiest food to take for human aliment is in the 
waters. It frequently comes to man's hand spontaneously. 

2. Transformations. — The early manufactures, arts, industries, and 
divisions of labor over the products of the sea are more varied than 
those of hunting or gleaning. 

3. Transportation. — By far the easiest primitive conveyance of man 
and transportation for the products of his activities were by water, and 
even now water transport is the cheapest. 



526 MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST. 

4. Barter. — The oldest form of money, tlie world over, is sliells from 
the water. For the most part primitive folk do not go far away from 
the water and the greatest cities are most accessible thereto. 

5. Consumption. — The preparation and serving of sea food, in variety, 
iu persistence throughout the year, in relation to cooking, drying, salt- 
ing, and smoking, answer the demands of human desire as well as 
either of the others mentioned. And much of it is eaten raw. 

FOOD AND MIGRATIONS IN AMERICA. 

In the Korth American Eeview of October, 18G!>, and January, 1870, 
the IJon. Lewis H. Morgan wrote upon Indian migrations over the 
continent of America as influenced by existing physical conditions, 
principally food supply. ' Because the region about the mouth of the 
Columbia Eiver was possessed of the most abundant materials of this 
character, IMr. Morgan made that the starting point of migration over 
the continent and worked out a scheme for the movements of the prin- 
cipal stocks of aborigines. 

I propose to take up the investigation of the distinguished ethnolo- 
gist by the aid of such new light as the studies of twenty-five years 
have acquired. .Vt present we may leave the question of the spread of 
stocks in America to the eminent gentlemen of the Bureau of Ethnol- 
ogy and to other scholars who are on the list of honorary members of 
our Anthropological Society, and inquire whether there be a practicable 
route from Indo Malaysia to the Columbia lliver or to any other point 
near by on the North Pacific Coast.- 

THE ROADS TO AMERICA. 

There are two possible routes from Asia to America, one of which 
has been often discussed; the other is, so far as I am aware, to be now 
for the first time proposed. 

The first mentioned is the Arctic or hyperborean route, across that 
culture region, or oikoumene, which I have elsewhere denominated the 
interhemispheric area. It is the land of dogs and reindeer, of snow 
and snowshoes, of fur clothing, marine and Arctic mammal food, under- 
ground dwellings, birch trees, and the arts springing therefrom, skin 
and bark boats, harpoons, sleds, all the way uninterruptedly from 
East Greenland to the Laud of the Midnight Sun, in Norway. This 
might be called the land or the suow-and-ice route. 

The route which I now propose might have been nearly all the way 
by sea. It could have been a continuously used route for centuries. 
Until interrupted by later civilizations, it might have been traveled 
over for thousands of years. It lies absolutely along a great circle of

the earth, the shortest and easiest liiglnvay upon the globe. I omit here 
the supposed route from Europe to Greenhuid. simply because it 
demands certain geological changes, all of Avhich the writer is now 
trying to avoid ; also those lines straight across the parallels from 
Polynesia, because the food supply was inadequate and the motives 
not apparent. Migrations of this sort are not denied or aflirmed; 
they are simply laid aside for the present. 

A HYPOTHETICAL CASE. 

The Haida Indians of British Columbia annually voyage as many as 
500 miles southward to Puget Sound to lay in a supply of dried clams 
and oysters for their own consumption and for trade. 
. Let us imagine a company of them or of their ancestors, no matter 
how many centuries ago, setting out from the Indian Ocean in an open 
boat no better than the one they now employ, and governed by the 
same commonplace motives. The peoples that our Ilaida would have 
to encounter now, or, better, those among whom the investigator would 
have mingled four hundred years ago, would have been — 

1. Malay-Polynesians, who would have transported him to the con- 
fines of Japan. 

2. The Japanese, and many hundreds of years ago the primitive 
Koreo-Japanese or their ancestors, or the i>rimitive peoples of the islands 
and peninsula. Their plate armor and hexagonal weaving he would 
encounter as far as numbers 8 to 10 on the map. 

3. Hiding astride of reindeer, drawn by dogs or reindeer, in bark 
canoes and dugouts, and at times in canoes lashed together or walking 
on snowshoes, the traveler might have gotten as far as Norton Sound. 

4. The Eskimo would have been his companions from Plover Bay in 
Asia to Cook Inlet, or to East Greenland, and their dress, often in 
Asiatic reindeer skin, as well as the identity of their industrial appa- 
ratus, would have prevented any shock in passing to the other side 
of the world. 

5. As soon as Mount St. Elias was reached and the area of the great 
cedars was encountered, the traveler would again enter a dugout canoe, 
whose lines and means of locomotion would uot be strange to him. He 
would see men clad in plate armor, wearing greaves on their legs as 
they did in Japan. All sorts of fishing apparatus and traps, and even 
the tales they told him, would appear familiar. 

6. On the Columbia, the salmon-eating jieoples would seem old time 
friends. The canoe, pointed at both ends under water, would remind 
him of the Amoor, and hereabout he would meet the northern division 
of the IJto-Aztecan stock, in whose company he might travel as far 
south as the borders of Chiriqui, ^ 

7. With the Maya, the mixed tribes of the isthmus, the Chibcha, and 
the Aymara-Kechua tribes he would complete his journey, passing 
through the lands of potters and stonecutters.

528 MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST. 

In order to make the problem of tlieir voj'aging as simjjle as possible, 
let us not at i)resent imagine any submergence of the ocean bed nor 
any geological nor pbysiograpliical cbaiiges, n.or any accidents out of 
the daily human experience. We may be allowed to restore to the 
waters and to the land such creatures as we know to have been 
destroyed out of them in recent centuries by the exigencies of enor- 
mously multiplied populations and the demands of modern commerce, 
but no more. It will make our in(|uiry much simpler and more scien- 
tific if we have no exi)eriences introduced or imagined that any man 
may not repeat at his leisure as in a laboratory. 

The separate marine inclosnres or areas in the progress of a migra- 
tion from the Indian Ocean to the Columbia River and southward about 
a great circle of the earth are roughly — 

1. The Indian Ocean, especially that part of its drainage toward the 
east. 

2. The Indo-]Malayan archipelago. 

3. The South China Sea and parts adjacent. 

4. The East China and the Yellow Sea. 

5. The Japanese and the Tartary Sea. 
G. The Okhotsk Sea and its environs. 

7. The Bering Sea and its drainages, 

8. The Alaskan sea and British Columbia, islands aud coast lands. 

9. Vancouver island and the Columbia basin and the head waters of 
the Mississippi drainage on the west. 

10. The great interior basin of the United States. 

11. The Pueblo region. 

12. Mexico. 

13. Central America. 

11. Colombia and Ecuador. 

15. Peru, its coast, mountains, lake region, and the head waters of 
the Amazon. 

10. The basin of- the La Plata. 

This general line is a great circle of the earth. On a Mercator map 
the straight lines are commonly taken for shortest distances, which 
they are not. Again, it so happens that the great circle here mentioned 
is the principal earthquake and volcanic line and the natural boundary 
of the Pacific Ocean. 

NECESSARY CONDITIONS. 

Tihe conditions into which the candid student wouhl be bound to 
inquire concerning such a route would be the following: 

1. Food supply. — Could our imaginary Haida crew of men and women 
travel, say, from the Andaman and Xicobar islands to the Columbia 
River, a distance of 10,000 miles, and live on the natural resources all 
the way? Are the situations and movements of this food sui)ply such 
as to toll or invite wandering people steadily and continuously onward ? 

2. Cowveyance. — Were the aboriginal means of conveyance in vogue 
in the Malay Polynesian area adequate to such a. journey t Could the

niodeiu Ilaida great canoe, the East Indian or the Malay-Polynesian 
craft stand sncli a trip? Are there landlocked seas all the way, snch 
as East Indians, Malays, and Haidas paddle in at home, at the present 
moment ? Had either people, before contact with whites, the ai)i)liauces 
and the skill for snch an excursion ? 

3. Currents and hiyhways. — In which direction do the ocean currents 
move along the route indicated — toward America or from America"? 

4. AVinds and temperature. — What winds blow along the Asiatic 
coast, about Bering Sea, and the archipelagos of the northwest Amer- 
ican coast? What is the effect on the atmosphere of the Avinds which 
blow from these currents and from the Tropics in respect of climate in 
the countries along the route? Would these winds gradually move 
peoples toward or away from America? If a boat without a crew were 
set adrift m the South China Sea, to what point would it drift? What 
series of isotherms are included in this area? 

5. Suggestions and barriers. — Are there any insurmountable barriers 
to our Haida Indians or Malays — that is, what would be the most diffi- 
cult places for them to pass by reason of distance from land to land, 
exposure to open sea or adverse winds, failure of provisions, or greater 
allurements in other directions? 

6. Blood. — Admitting that the aborigines of America are from the 
Eastern Continent, what peoples of the Old World are most like those 
of the JSTew, anatomically and anthropometrically, by which is meant 
in skeleton, in muscular development, height, weight, physiognomy, 
color of the hair, eyes, skin, etc.? 

7. Social structure. — The aborigines of the Western Continent had a 
social structure built up on the gentile ssystem, practicing endogamy as 
regards the tribe and exogamy as regards the clan. Now, should our 
Ilaida Indians find any peoples about the Indian Ocean or elsewhere 
along the route who had the very same or nearly the same social 
structure ? 

8. Language. — What testimony does language bear to the kinship of 
American aborigines with Eastern peoples'? To what languages in 
the Eastern Continent are the American tongues nearest akin? Does 
the present condition of the language problem close the door of inquiry 
concerning migration from Asia to America? 

9. Arts.—Vxx the arts of practical life and the arts of pleasure, what 
similarities should our company of Haida Indians find? It is freely 
admitted and indisputable that similarities arise in these respects by 
stress of the earth and stress of a common brotherhood of man ; but 
such similarities are more or less functional or general or coordinated. 
The more that things or customs agree in minute structure, the more 
specifi-ialiy are they akin and have had the selfsame originators. In 
other words, the greater the similarity, the less the probability of 
diverse origins. Are there any arts so akin structurally as to make the 
theory of independent origin improbable? 

SM 94 34 



530 MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST. 

10. Remains and Mstoric evuJcnee. — What relics of primitive occnpa- 
tioii sliould our voyagers encounter that would remind tliem of Lome, 
and wliat testimony liave we of sucli aboriginal peoples 1 Or, to pnt 
the question in another form, if one of our distinguished archaeologists, 
Morse or Putnam or Holmes, or an historian, such as Brinton, made the 
journey with the Haidas, would he come across any shell heaps, aban- 
doned dwelling sites or work places, or ancient documents entirely 
inexplicable by the present inhabitants, but quite plain to one skilled 
in the antiquities of onr own continent? 

11. Religion and folldore. — What is the testimony of comparative 
mythology concerning the inhabitants of the spirit world and their con- 
dnct as believed in throughont the several neritic areas mentioned? 
In the cult of these regions what similarities exist in sacred places — 
houses, images, and worships'? What folk customs seem to be akin? 

12. Modern witnesses. — Not only trained ethnologists, but naval offi- 
cers, navigators, travelers, and missionaries are constantly testifying 
and declaring their convictions of the commerce and blood relationship 
between the two sides of the Pacific. Any one of these witnesses might 
be entirely inadequate; but what weight is to be given to the cumula- 
tive testimony? 

h\ brief, the conditions demanded for aboriginal connnunication are 
the following: 

1. Abundant supply of food and clotliing all the way. 

2. Easy means of transportation and conveyance. 

3. Impelling oceanic currents and highways. 

4. Favoring winds and temperature. 

5. Encouragements rather than dfscour:igements, invitations and not 
barriers. 

6. Eesemblances of ethnic kinships. 

7. Similarities in social structures and fnnctions dei)ending on 
kinship, 

8. Homologous types in language. 

9. Similarities in arts otherwise inexplicable. 

10. The favorable witness of archaeology and history. 

11. The same traditions, folklore, mythology, and cults. 

12. The confirmatory tCvStimony of ethnographers, travelers, observ- 
ers, etc. 

Let us examine them in order. 

A DEFINITE PROrOSITION. 

In order to test the foregoing questions tlie ibllowing coiurrete 
hypothesis is advanced for examination: 

That daring the centuries in which Enrope was working out of her 
earliest stone age into her renaissance, certainly for three thonsand years 
or more, America was being steaddy and continnonsly pcoijled from 
Asia by way of its eastern shores and seas from the Indian Ocean. Sub 



MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST. 531 

sidiary movements in the way of offslioots from this migration, contribu- 
tions to it, and barriers to its progress were effected up and down the 
rivers and in the seas of India, China, Mongolia, and Siberia. That 
such a movement was practicable, consider the following arguments: 

I. — ABUNDANCE OF FOOD. 

In each of the areas mentioned there are a great number of species 
of food plants and animals; the individnals of many species are of 
great size, and of all the species there is prodigal quantity. 

In the Indian Ocean and South China seas the animals are tropical 
and the natives are expert in their capture. 

In East China Sea and Japan Sea are inexhaustible supplies of shad, 
herring, mackerel, cod, and local species. Besides these, food plants, 
water fowl, and marine invertebi-ates still abound for every need of the 
])eo])le. 

Before the Russians began their operations in northeastern Asia 
the peninsula of Kamchatka supported (>0,000 inhabitants; but under 
their rule the using up of the food supply and the introduction of 
fatal diseases decimated that number. At the present time the sea 
of Okhotsk would yield salmon and other aquatic food in abundance 
for any aboriginal needs; and prior to one hundred and fifty years ago 
the Rhytina afforded the absolute nnxxinuini of aliment for the least 
effort. There was also no liniit to subsistence in Bering Sea. Further- 
more, no sooner do we approach the latitude where the rigors of the 
climate demand extra clothing and fuel for the body than we tind 
nmrine mammals and land mammals superabounding. Whale, seal, 
walrus, and sea lion in the water, and elk and reindeer and bears on 
land, are even more serviceable than the fish, for they are house and 
furnace and clothing and food all in one. In no region of the world do 
food-fishes and land and sea mammals exist so abundantly and so 
accessibly.^ 

II. — THE NAVAL TOSSIBILITIES. 

To investigate the second topic, namely, the possibilities of such a 
voyage or journey with the appliances at hand, it will be necessary to 
inquire as to — 

1. Its length and directness. 

2. The quality of the ships and other modes of conveyance. 

3. The ability of the mariners and native travelers. 

4. The depth of water and the character of land routes. 

5. Whether the environment is such as vsavages are accustomed to. 
1. Length and directness. — All modern steamships travel on the great

tion. The -writer acknowledges his obligations to Dr. G. Brown Goode and Dr. 
Tarleton H. Bean for information on these points. 



532 MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST. 

circles of tlie earth as the shortest distance between two points. The 
Canadian Pacific steamers sliirt the Aleutian chain on the way to Vic- 
toria from Yokohama. A great circle of the earth between the Straits 
of Malacca and the Columbia's mouth i^asses through every one of the 
shallow food-stocked areas named, and, continuing onward, is in touch 
with the buffalo feeding grounds at the sources of the great rivers, with 
the pueblo region, Mexico and Central America, and the highlands of 
Peru and Ecuador. The Aztecs, Mayas, Chibchas, and Kechuas were 
the antipodes of the ancient inhabitants of the Malay Archipelago. 

2. 3Io(h'S of conrei/ance. — As for the ships, it will be admitted that 
the aborigines of this continent Avere jjossessed of every form of boat 
known in the Eastern Continent except the outrigger canoe — kaiak, 
umiak, pirogue, bark canoe, coracle, skin float, raft, and reed float. They 
Avere singuhirly poor in appliances for land travel south of the dog and 
snow line; indeed, they kept to the waters closely. By a system of 
portages they had connected the Arctic Ocean and the Columbia's 
mouth with the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. On our great circle, 
in areas 14 and 15 on the map, the American camel assumes the role of 
burden bearer. 

Upon the Asiatic side the aborigines have been greatly disturbed by 
Kussians, Japanese, and Chinese; but in the Malay Peninsula are 
craft as varied and as effectual, and the lines of the vessels are strik- 
ingly like to those of our western coast; and the natives now journey 
from Jjering Straits southward to Japan by dogs and on snowshoes. 

3. Mariners and native travelers. — When Europeans visited the Indian 
Ocean and the Pacific these waters were covered with hardy navigators. 
I am even tempted to suggest that the turning aside of a stream of pre- 
Malays, who were the Phcenicians of the Orient, by the Mongoloid intru- 
sion from inland may have led to the peopling of the archij)elagoes of the 
Pacific after America was fairly settled and a northward migration was 
interrupted. 

4. Water and land routes. — All the way from the Straits Settlements 
to Vancouver, as will be seen by the Chalh-nger map and the British 
Admiralty charts, we have shallow water. There is a broad bench con- 
stituting the marine feeding ground, where the series of outlying islands 
and archipelagoes fence in the neritic areas. The conditions are perfect. 
Aiul inland, where navigation is the least x>erilous, food becomes the 
more abundant. 

5. Nature of environment. — Each one of these environments is within 
the capabilities of savages. The landmarks were their light-houses; 
the inlets were their harbors innumerable; the grass and the color of 
the water were their barometers j the mammals, fishes, and birds were 
their pilots. They were scarcely subjected to the terrors and dangers 
of the fathomless sea.^

Snowshoes, by Richard J. Bush, N. Y., 1871. 



MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST. 533 

III. — OCEAN CURRENTS AND FOOD SUPPLY.^ 

lu following" this Hue of enormous food supply our voyagers would 
be materially aided by the ocean currents. The equatorial stream of 
the Pacific flows westward between the Tropic of Cancer and the 
Micronesian axchipelagoes. On reaching the South China Sea it is 
split, a part going southward and westward into the Indian Ocean and 
a part northward and eastward, like our Gulf Stream, skirting the 
outer rim of the seas that I have mentioned all the way to the Columbia 
Eiver. Within these seas counter currents and eddies help to equalize 
the temperature of the adjacent lands. The effect of this Kuroshiwo, as 
the ocean current is called, is much greater uj)on the food supply than 
upon the people. Bringing millions of tons of tropical silt and low sea 
forms in its stream, this Nile of the Pacific deposited them over the bed 
of the landlocked areas, acting like a top-dressing upon soil and a feeder 
of the aquatic food fauna. The lowering of temperature northward 
naturally would give the migrants an increased advantage in life's strug- 
gles as the climate became more stimulating, fecundating, and strength- 
ening. 

IV. — PREVAILING WINDS AND FOOD. 

As for. the prevailing winds, the trades blow westward in the 
Tropics. On reaching the Pacific shore they would follow some such 
law as that of the waters, but during the months of May to October 
the simoom from the Indian Ocean pushes northeastward and drives 
the trades along Asia northeastward. As we proceed the ocean current 
is spread out, and the winds blowing from warmer latitudes exert their 
benign influences on the coast of southeastern Alaska, British Colum- 
bia, and the State of Washington. The temperature of the whole route

534 MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST. 

V. — ENCOURAGEMENTS AND DISCOURAGEMENTS. 

Morgan says that barbarians, ignorant of agricnlture and depending 
upon fish and game for subsistence, spread over hirge areas with great 
rapidity. Under the operations of purely physical causes they would 
reach in their migrations the remotest boundaries of a continent in a 
much shorter time than a civilized people, with all the appliances of 
civilization.' 

The same is trne of the seas so long as they are unimpeded. Even 
after the first occupancy new peoples constantly wedge themselves in, 
as they have done in Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California. 

Two things would modify the track of migration which we are dis- 
cussing, to wit: 

1. The intrusion into the neritic areas along the Asiatic side of peo- 
ples that were sedentary and who assumed ownership of them, turning 
the highways into possessions and blocking further j)rogress of migra- 
tion. This intrusion ended at the North with Eussia and the United 
States, 1728-1894. The white race in 1198 first set its greedy eyes upon 
the east, and Magellan died on the Philippines in 1521. 

2. The intrusion of foreign elements into the stream of northeast 
movement. To continue the figure of the Haida voyagers, su^iposing 
they had replaced, as they went from sea to sea, any who died, whether 
men or women, with recruits from the shore. In a long voyage the 
complexion of the crew on arriving at Victoria w^ould be greatly modi- 
fied; also they may have left at the mouths of the Canton, Yangtze, 
Yellow, and Amoor rivers one or more pairs of their passengers. All 
of these things would have been i)erfectly natural to do. 

But supposing that instead of a single canoe load of fifty Indians 
there were a stream of canoe loads flowing for thousands of years, 
when the eastern part of Asia was like the west coast of America fifty 
years ago; then colonies would be dropj)ed in every favorable place 
and the peopling of eastern Asia would go on from the sea up the 
rivers and not from the land down the rivers. These peoplings may 
be described as waves, and we might speak of — 

1. The American Avave leaving the Japanese shell heaps. 

2. Eskimo, Aleut, Jenessai, Ostyak wave. 

3. Hyperborean Asiatic wave, peopling Siberia. 

4. Aino wave, quite as likely to have followed our route as any other 

5. Mongoloid waves from inland seaward, ending in j)ermanent indus- 
trial settlements and the cessation of migrating. 

Imagine eastern-Asia at the beginning of our era, or a thousand years 
before that, the abode of teeming populations of aborigines, living, 
moving, trading along these landlocked highways abundantl}^ provided 
with food. They were fishers and hunters. Contemporaneously, in the

MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST. 535 

Nile Valley, iu Syria aud Mesopotamia, iu China and India, cereal, 
pastoral, aud mecliauical industries have been developing. Many of 
the peoples practicing- them push to the east; they divide the coast. 
The aborigines disappear; they leave their shell heaps and move north- 
ward, then eastward and westward, following the winds and currents, 
and take the shortest and most inviting path onward. 

There came to the eastern side of America three hundred years ago 
the nations of Europe. They crossed the continent and circumnavi- 
gated it. They severed our aboriginal Pacific Coast culture in many 
places : 

1. The Kussiaus in Bering Sea nearly severed the native commerce 
of the two hemisi)heres. 

2. The Hudson Bay Company enlisted the movements of the Indians 
iu their behalf and destroyed the aboriginal migrations and commerce. 

3. The American fur traders projected their operations between the 
stocks of Oregon and California. 

4. These were followed by exj)lorers, settlers, and miners in our 
century. 

5. The transcontinental railroads and the creation of independent 
states obliterated all vestiges of- former aboriginal movements. 

VI. — THE RACE PROBLEM. 

The opinion of such scholars as Morgan and Brinton as to the unique- 
ness and homogeneity of an American breed or race is not gainsaid, 
but surely the last word has not been said upon this theme. It can not 
be denied, however, that this race is a mixed one fundamentally, and 
that there enter into it varied anthropometric characters. This is not 
only true of the living tribes, but of the bones from the graves. It has 
even been averred that Polynesians may have crossed from the Pacific 
archipelagoes, moved northward aud mixed with long-headed northern- 
ers, forming a mesocephalic type. 

Kow, I would beg leave to suggest a different solution for these mys- 
teries: Following the most abundant food supply along the seas iu 
which primitive men were best equipped to obtain it, following currents 
of earth forces that would furuish incitement and even motive power, 
the ancestors of Malays, Polynesians, and Indians could have come 
from the equator to America, traveising for nearly the entire distance 
a series of landlocked seas of shallow water, abounding in food supply 
of fish and birds aud marine invertebrates, aud part of the way with 
innumerable vertebrates, as we have seen. 

As to cranial index, the Eskimo are among the longest- headed peo- 
ples of the world, ranking with Abyssiuians, Caroline Islanders, Hot- 
tentots, and some Polynesians. Most Americans are mesocephalic, as 
are the Malay-Polynesians, but the northern Mongoloids are the 
shortest-headed people iu the world. In uasal iudex Topiuard places

fbe redskins next to the yellow races of Asia, and in liis general 
scheme the redskins folloAY the Polynesians.^ 

VII. — THE PROBLEMS OF SOCIOLOGY. 

All the tribes in America except the Eskimo were found living under 
a peculiar system of relationship. Each tribe was eudogamous, but it 
was split into gentes that were exogamous. Connected with this was 
a system of classific relationship, descent in the female line, and other 
social and political regulations that were new to the explorers. Mor- 
gan found that each great ethnic group had its own marital and polit- 
ical system, and these he has classified in his monumental work. He 
says: ''The system of the Seneca-Iroquois Indians of New York is 
identical, not only in radical characteristics, but also in the greater 
portion of its minute details, with that of the Tamil people of south 
India." It is not to be supposed that the Tamil and the Iroquois are 
for that reason brothers. But they are in possession of a common 
social expression that came to them botli from a common source. 

VIII. — AMERICAN AND ASIATIC LANGUAGES. 

Linguistically speaking, the Bering Strait is not the dividing line of 
two continents, since the Eskimo extend also into Asia, having, accord- 
ing to some, gone over from America. Contiguous to the Eskimo in 
America are the Athapascan family on the west and the Algonquin 
family on the east. Contiguous to the Eskimo in Asia are the Chukchis, 
and these are joined to other unclassed peoples. Now, the Chukchi 
language and the Athapascan language and the other Asiatic and 
American languages are noted for their lexical and grammatical differ- 
ences and not for relationshiiis. 

But there were one hundred and twenty separate famihes of languages 
in America. The peculiar family .system of the American aborigines, 
restricting marriage in the tribe, was more conducive to the rapid mul- 
tiplication of languages than any other that could be devised. In that 
dispersive, centrifugal period of human history Avhich preceded the 
invention of a written language changes must have gone on rapidly. 
Furthermore, philologists have not had the material upon which to 
work in forming a solid theory of linguistic relationships, and the latest 
researches do not justify the assertion that the American languages 
stand alone in morphology. 

While it is true that identity of language is a good proof of the kin- 
ship of peoples, in the present state of knowledge the lack of j)roof of 
identity is no disproof of relationship or acquaintance in times remote, 
or proof of nonrelationship by consanguinity or contact.

Progress," in Smithsonian Annual Reports, 1885 to 1893. The writer does not now

IX. — SIMILARITIES IN ARTS. 

To attempt iu a short address to elucidate the -svhole subject of simi- 
larities in arts along the two shores would consume too much time.' 
The speaker will sufficiently orient himself iu the minds of his readers 
by saying- that there was scarcely an original fuudamental idea 
developed ujion the Western Hempshire. Every one of the industrial 
and aesthetic arts here can be matched by one from Asia or Oceanica. 
The differences are varietal, regional, tribal, si)ecial, natural. Many 
American arts also tally with those of prehistoric Europe, but these 
also came from that common ancestral source that supplied both Europe 
and Asia and America. 

There is nothing unnatural or improbable in the supposition that the 
original migrants to a country should lay aside an art on the way and 
pick it up again in succeeding generations. Tribal memories do not 
die because demands cease or resources temporarily fail. This does not 
controvert Tylor's proposition, that a people that has acquired an art 
never loses it. I am now speaking of a stream of migration starting 
out from the equator and i^assing northward out of one culture area 
of mineral, vegetal, and animal supply, and of aerial, marine, and ter- 
restrial conditions, and moving northward into and through a series of 
different supplies and conditions as ftir as there is a motive, and then 
repeating the process southward on another continent. This would 
require centuries. In one region a peculiar exigency evokes the art of 
Avorking in hard stone: in a series of regions beyond, the absence of 
material, or of the proper tools, or of a demand for the product, inter- 
rupts or converts this art into something else. By and by the descend- 
ants of this people come upon new quarries, demands, and appliances. 
The art or folklore breaks forth again iu such striking similarity to the 
old as to raise the inquiry among ethnologists whether some unfortu- 
nate castaway may not have been thrust ashore here and taught all the 
people a foreign art. This is highly improbable. The naturalists have 
no difficulty of accounting for such occurrences in nature, and they 
call them atavism. Technical atavism, or the revival of an industry 
that has lived in tradition,^ then may and does account for the recur- 
rence of some ancient Asiatic arts in America and of the same art iu 
America in regions wide apart. 

X. — THE WITNESS OP ARCHy^OLOGY. 

Archeology has begun to bear testimony upon these possible migra- 
tions. Morse discovered shell heaps in Japan, and his researches 
were followed up by Kanda upon the stone implements. The ancient 

' The author is preparing for publication an illustrated paper on the arts of the two 
sides of the Pacific, iu which the matter will be minutely discussed. 

2 This is excellently illustrated by Rae, in Jour. Anthrop. lust., Loud., 1878, Vol. 
VII, i)p. 130, 131, with reference to the Eskimo house. 



538 MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUE«T. 

Japanese stoue iiupleiuents are identical with the American in tech- 
nique aud strikingly similar in shaj»e. Even the jesthetic forms are 
wrought in precisely the same manner. It is well known that several 
waves of aboriginal occupation preceded the present Mongol dynasty 
in China, and students are waiting with interest to know more about 
them and the j)aths by which they entered the celestial domain. 

XI. — RELIGION AjN'D FOLKLORE. 

I think that all American myths point to northern origin. They are 
filled with stories of the sea; but there is little ground now, in the 
infancy of the science of folklore and mythology, upon which to build 
theories. 

I mention in passing the Easter Island images, the Xew Zealand 
and other Polynesian wood carvings, and the general suggestion of the 
Northwest toteai devices in the Japanese areas.^ 

Father Morice says that the western Ddne about Stuart Lake, in 
British Columbia, have a tradition that "days were formerly so very 
short that sewing the edge of a muskrat skin was all that one woman 
could do between sunrise and sunset."^ Boas says that the Kwakiutl 
on the Pacific coast of British Columbia tell of a i)laee Avhere the sun 
does not shine, where there are no trees, and where peo^^le ride in 
boats made of skins. These people tell of a place where the trees are 
all hollow in the middle so that they carry water in the trunks. As 
a matter of fact, though it may not count for much, the same tribe 
make gashes in a plank and convert it into a box with invisible Joints 
precisely as the Chinese work in bamboo. 

On the other hand, no northern tribe has the slightest conception 
that they have relatives in the south. 

Boas, who has studied the west coast myths more than anyone else, 
points to their Asiatic origin. 

XII. — THE TESTIMONY OF ETHNOGRAPHERS AND OTHERS. 

Finally, and I do not think that such cumulative evidence is to be 
despised, all intelligent travelers are struck with the similarities exist- 
ing between our west coast Indians and existing eastern Asiatics. It 
is true that those who have noted these resemblances have resorted to 
untenable theories to account for them, but false theory and good 
emi)iric data are not incompatible. It is well known that oar Eskimo 
have peopled a portion of northeastern Asia, following the dominating 
instinct for aliment and comfort. The proposition I wish to defend is 
that this close connection between the two continents has existed for 
thousands of years, during which the contact between western Amer- 
ica and eastern Asia was more and more close and extended and 

'Cf. J. G. Frazer, Toteuiism, Ecliub., 1887, Black.

MIGRATION AND THE FOOD QUEST. 539 

imbroken as we x)ruceed backward iu time. Or, to pat the matter in 
anotlier shape, there never was known to history a day when the two 
continents were not intimately associated. The evidences of the past 
seem to confirm the ojDinion that as we go backward in time the geo- 
graphic conditions were more favorable and the contact more intimate. 

In conclnsion, the author has not here nndertaken to do more than to 
clear the way for a specific study of the civilizations of America and 
those of eastern Asia. 

Such a study will require a great deal of patient inquiry on the part 
of students cooi^eratiug systematically and scrupulously ouly to know 
the truth. The investigations of Dr. Walter Hough show that the fire 
drill, consistiug of a vertical revolving shaft and a horizontal hearth 
piece, exists uninterruptedly from Australia to Tierra del Fuego, and 
that besides this common apparatus, on the contrary, in the Malay 
area, have also been invented the fire plow, the fire saw, and the fire 
syriuge. Wherever the better modes of fire making have superseded, 
as in Japan, the carpenter goes on boriug holes with reciprocating 
motion between his palms. 

Dr. Hough's studies in x)late armor point to its existence in the entire 
stretch from Japan to the Columbia. If anyone will study carefully 
Von Schrenk's Eeisen und Forschungen im Amur-Lande, third volume, 
and compare the figures and plates with similar illustrations from the 
Aleutian Islands or east Greenland, he will at every turn be arrested 
by seemingly useless similarities. The curious ivory ornaments on the 
sea otter hunter's wooden hat, made at great cost, ai e only explained 
by the patterns cut from bark and attached to their clothing. The same 
odd fashion is in full play in east Greenland. The harpoon of the 
east Greenlander and the central Eskimo, with line hole through the 
toggle head effected by two diagonal holes bored in the flat side, is 
almost precisely that of the Gihak. The canoe of bark pointed at 
both ends below the water line is identical on the Amur and the Koo- 
tenay, and so on. 

The author protests against closing the door of investigation per- 
emptorily, believing that it is the privilege of all to open any question 
anew. He desires to lay aside for the present any arguments relying 
upon continents that have disappeared, upon voyages across the pro- 
found sea without food or motive, upon the accidental stranding of 
junks, or upon the aimless wandering of lost tribes. These may all 
have entered into the problem of the aboriginal life of America. They 
are historical and geological questions and must be decided by the 
methods of these two sciences. It is here essayed to show that when 
the continent of America was peopled, it was done by men and women 
purposely engaged in what all sensible i)eople are now doing, namely, 
trying to get all the enjoyment possible out of life for their eftbrts, and 
that the present condition of the earth and of peoples offers all the 
opportunity necessary for such peopling. 



THE GUAN^CHES: THE ANCIENT INHABITANTS OF 

CANARY.' 



By Capt. J. W. Gambier, It. N. 



Much has been written of late and much said of the merits of the 
Canary Islands as health resorts, but as yet the attention of the gen- 
eral public does not seem to have been drawn to the extremely inter- 
estiug problems as to the remote past of the human race which a 
study of the manners and customs of the ancient inhabitants of these 
islands affords. Various spots on the face of the earth have been 
claimed by scientific men as the cradle of the human race, and different 
nations adopt different names for the three or four recognized types 
which have been discovered in long barrows and round barrows, in 
caves, and deep under the soil; but practically it comes to the same 
thing, by whatever name they may be known, if we can only identify 
these people with others bearing the same structural peculiarities, and 
this, as regards the Guaucherace of the Canary Islands, we are enabled 
to do. We trust, therefore, that the following remarks and sketches 
may enable those who are unable to visit those extraordinarily inter- 
esting places in person to form some idea of what our earliest ancestors, 
or at least their contemporaries, were like. 

The habitations of tliese ancient people, who were of what we call 
the Iberian race, were mostly caves excavated in the sandstone rock, 
which crops out in some parts of these otherwise almost entirely vol- 
canic islands. But the stone implements of ruder form, preserved in 
the museum of Las Palmas, were no doubt the workmanship of people 
long ago antecedent to those who scooped out tliese very symmetrical 
caves. Who or what thej^^ were is lost in the dim uncertainty of the 
past, and nothing but their bones and their skulls and their rude imple- 
ments remains to us. In some few instances the caves were hollowed 
out of the easily worked tufa, or volcanic deposit; but as to the great 
majority of these caves in the tufa it may be said that they are merely 
accidental holes utilized by the earliest aborigines, and are not nearly 
so interesting as the sandstone dwellings. As to these sandstone caves, 
it must have been a most laborious work for people to produce them 
whose only tools were implements of stone. It may be accepted as a 
generally well-ascertained fact that in some of these caves we are actu-

ally stauding in tlie cave liouies of those inhabitants of onr j?lobe who 
lived in the Paleolithic age — that is, the age of the unpolished stone; 
the age immediately succeeding the most primeval race of which we 
have any trace at all; a race whose antiquity is measured by the liglit 
of modern science as coexistent with the last glacial epoch, and which 
possibly existed even before that period. Nor is this, in the case of the 
people we wish to describe, mere supposition, for by anthropometrical 
observation, as well as by craniology (the twin sciences of human meas- 
urements of bones and skulls), we are brought face to face with the 
fact that in the slow and eternal evolution of the human race certain 
structural peculiarities belong to these early races whose remains we 
find in these islands, which have either been modified to suit an altered 
environment or have entirely disappeared, as no longer necessary either 
in the struggle for existence or in the enjoyment of life — the two most 
potent factors in all the complex processes of evolntion. 

As regards this structural alteration, it may be briefly said that a cer- 
tain peculiarity in the elbow joint — which doubtless served some purpose 

to our arboreal progenitors, but which in 
parts of Europe where races have been 
more rapidly mixed, or wher^ civilization 
has made more rapid strides, and conse- 
quently the process of evolution become 
more determined, has ceased to exist — 
existed amongthe Guanches, and is still

day in a proportion far exceeding that 
in any other known race. In England, in our days, this peculiarity is 
practically extinct — in some parts of the world it reaches 2 per cent of 
the population — but here, amongthe Guanches, it has been ascertained 
by actual observation to reach to the astonishing number of 20 per cent, 
showing a race who have been so little intermixed and so direct in descent 
from the Stone age as it would be difficult to find except in the most 
isolated parts of the world, among races such as the Aztecs, or the inhab- 
itants of some of the Pacific Ocean islands, or among the natives of Aus- 
tralia. This is one of the peculiar interests of the Guanche race. 

This sketch of the arm bones shows the peculiar bone structure 
referred to above. It should be observed that the ordinary arm bone 
has no hole in it at all. (Fig. 1.) 

Again, the craniology of these people has been identified by Dr. J. 
Cleasby Taylor, the resident English physician at Las Palmas, as prov- 
ing their Iberian descent, belonging as they did to the Dolichocephalic 
branch of the human race. So that, whether the Guanches owe their 
origin to some primordial race of men coexistent with the earliest genesis 
of man, or whether they brought these strongly marked structural char- 
acteristics from IJerber or other mainland races, does not affect the 
question of their antiquity. 




THE GUANCHES. 



543 




DOLICHOCEPHALIC SKULL. 



The skulls illustrated (Figs. 2, 3) are drawn from specimens in the 
collection of tlie museum of Las Palmas. The first is a purely Iberian 
type, belonging to one of the three or four great divisions of the human 
race— those large groups or nationalities which had gradually formed 
from out of tlie primordial and half-simian swarms that had preceded 
tlicin. These Iberians inhabited the greater part of Avestern Europe in 
an infinitely remote period, probably toward the termination of the last 
glacial epoch, which some would place at 
eighty to ninety thousand years ago. 
These men lived and died among the gigan- 
tic animals now extinct; among mammoths, 
the giant elk of Iceland, the cave bear, and 
so forth. In England and in most parts 
of western Europe (except Germany, where 
tliey never penetrated) the remains of this 
race Iiave been found in what are termed 
the long barrows^ as distinguished from the 
round barrows, which belonged to the 
round lieaded, a stronger race, who gradu- 
ally eliminated the weaker. This long- 
headed race are known asthe Iberian ; they 
inhabited the Basque provinces, Spain, 

northern Africa, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and the Canary Islands, and 
it is the same race who, by some yet unsolved problem, found their way 
to Mexico. These Iberians, however, gradually gave way before the 
stronger races — the Aryan, the Scandinavian, and the Ligurian — but 
in these remote Canary Islands they lived on less molested, less influ- 
enced by more dominant races, and hence have transmitted to a com- 
paratively recent time their structural peculiarities. For this reason 
the caves and places of sepulture, which the 
Spanish discovered here in the early part of the 
fifteenth century, still retained the remains of 
the most ancient race known to us — still indi- 
cated their modes of life, and brought down 
the manners and habits of the Stone period to 
within three hundred years of our time. 

A glance at the two skulls as drawn here will 
show the difference between the two types of 
skull. The first, it will be observed (an ancient 
Guanche skull of the Iberian race), IS longbehind, 
low in front, and has the jaw hardly at all advanced from a perpendicu- 
lar line down from the eye-socket. This, in scientific parlance, is the 
Dolichocephalic and orthognathic type — that is, long-headed and weak, 
or slightly protruding chin. The other skull, it will be at once seen, is of 
a ditterent type — rounder, bolder, with more frontal development, and 
with the jaw coming well forward. This is called the Bi-achycephalic

and xjrogiiatliic type, two words describing the above properties. Now, 
these Brachyeeplialic types of the human race are those that have super- 
seded the weaker race almost all over Europe, and it is from these tliat 
the great Anglo-Saxon, Scandinavian, and, generally speaking, Teu- 
tonic and Latin races have come. Of course, there existed intermediary 
types, brought about by intermarriage; but these are few, and in the 
eternal process of evolution the stronger naturally jirevailed. 

The nuimmified head, of which we give a sketch, is that of an ancient 
Iberian. It is quite impossible to assign a date to any of these Guanche 
mummies, for they have no accomi^anyiug writing of any kind, and 
have left no record behind them. (Fig. 4.) 

The mummies of the Canary Islands present some verj^ interesting 
peculiarities, and have been found in great numbers in the caves that 
have been used indifferently as places of sepulture and as the abodes 
of the living. The art of embalming must have been learned from stray 
Egyptians or Phojnicians, and there is a legend 
that in the thirteenth century before Christ 
the then Egyptian ruler sent a colony to these 
islands, who settled here. The Guanche mum- 
mies, however, differ from the Egyi^tian in sev- 
eral respects. The bodies were sewn up in many 
folds of goatskin (twenty to twenty-five in some 
cases), and the legs were sometimes bent back 
and doubled onto the breast. The bodies, after 
a little preparation, were sun-baked, and were 
then sewn up with lumps of balsam laid in the 
folds. They have been found in a perfect state 
of preservation, though many can not be less 
Up to what date the Guaiiches continued to 
mummify their dead it is difticult to say, but there is reason to sup- 
pose that the practice has been extended here far longer than any- 
where else in the world. All their dead were not, however, mummified. 
The lower orders of the people were buried in cairns, the body laid 
on a heap of lava and covered over with stones. Thousands of these 
have been found, and have afforded most valuable anthropometrical 
information. 

Our sketch shows the mummy of a young woman of the early type, 
long headed, and with nonprojecting jaw. She must have been about 
5 feet 1 inch, and apparently in perfect proportion. She was a mother, 
and her infant baby was found in the case with her, and still lies near 
her. The covering skins have been opened for examination. (Fig. 5.) 

We must picture to ourselves the ancient Iberians slowly giving up 
cannibalism, slowly learning to use fire, which the volcanoes of these 
islands, that were active until recent days, must have early taught them 
to apply to some luirpose; or we must think of them as struggling with 
gigantic animals, which by constant warfare through thousands, possi-

bly millions, of years they fiually exterminate, and we must watch them 
gradually improving in such rude arts of fashioniug stone as we know 
them to have possessed. Then the next stride would have been by 
making- their cave homes, employing still better implements of stone, 
polishing basalt, and shaping many things Avhich indicate both skill 
and imagination in their design, and so on, until they begin to adopt 
l)astoral habits, to breed flocks and herds, and with some gradually 
dawning ideas of what we term modesty, stitching the skins of their 
goats and sheep into garments. Thus slowly these islanders drift on, 
forming themselves into families, and- into village communities, and 
unconsciously evolving sonie patriarchal kind of government; take to 
having one wife, and one only; discover and enforce those main princi- 
ciplesof virtue to which even all our ('ivilization has added nothing, 
namely, courage, truth, and chastity. We must also picture to our- 
selves that in other i)arts of the world infinitely more rapid strides were 
being made; for whilst these ancient Canarians were only beginning to 
polish their basalt hatchets, the Etruscan and pre-llellenic races, the

Lignrians and our own Celtic ancestors, were already fashioning bronze; 
Homer's heroes were fighting, and were being buried at Hissarlik; and 
Avarriors, whose mythical names seem to have reached our day, were 
conquering still earlier races in our own islands. And still greater 
changes soon took place among more forward races in Europe and Asia. 
Iron was supplanting bronze; the mythical personages of pre-IIellenic 
days were giving way to historical men and women; civilization was 
rushing forward; the perfect gONernment of early Greece was forming 
itself; dynasties in Egypt were rising and falling; the Phwuicians 
were peopling Spain, and driving out, or becoming identified with, the 
Iberians of that land; and even the Celts in our islands were giving 
way before the powerful red-haired, strong-jawed Scandinavians. But 
here iu Canary things stood still. The people were a])parently per- 
fectly content with their own mode of life, and lived on in their cave 
dwellings, undisturbed by the strife and bloodshed which inevitably 
accompany civilization. 

The sketches we give illustrate the rude stone implements used by 
these people in excavating their cave homes, the very same caves that

are still inhabited by the islanders of this day. They were held in one 
hand and nsed as we use a pick; but from the shape of one of these 
sketches it will easily be observed that a hamnuM'-shaped instrument 
was also used. These ail belong- to the Paleolithic age. They are gen- 
erally chipped roug'hly out 
of bine lias, weighing- 4 or 5 
pounds each. A larger kind 
weighed as nuich as 8 
pounds. (Fig-. (I.) 

The uext grou]) belong 
to the jSTeolithic age, and it 
would seem that in this age 
greater precision of work- 
manship Avas obtained in 
cave making, as is only 
natnral with improved in- 
struments. What interval 
of time elapsed between 
these periods is naturally merely conjectuie. These neolithic instru- 
ments are generally of lava or some hard trap. They were smaller, 
and many were of the ordinary spear and arrow head form found all 
over the world. (Fig. 7.) 

But now we come to a classic i)eriod in this Gnanche life. For though 
they remained untouched by what was going on in the world, the world 
itself already began to feel a deep interest in these " Fortunate Islands," 
especially the Greeks and Pha>nicians, to whose influence it is not 
to be Tdoubted the islanders owed some advance in their ceramic art, 
and possibly imi^rovements in their mode of life. For these were the 
islands of the Hesperides, and the peak of Tenerifife was the Atlas 
that bore up the heavens; and to these very islands Homer made 
Ju])iter send Menelaus as a reward for 
all his wrongs and all that he had sul^ 
fered. They were the Elysian Fields, 
"those blessed isles where the bitterness 
of winter is unknown, and where the 
M'inds of the ocean forever freshen the 
balmy air." This, too, is the home of 
Plato's vanished Atlantis, his ideal re- 
])ublic. 

It thus becomes a strange speculation 
as to how around the lives of these simple 
islanders, people only half euuMged from 
the actual condition of primordial man, the most exquisite myths and the 
most deeply suggestive legends of old days have grouped themselves. 
Here were a people who scarcely knew vice. Paid vice was unknown ; and 
the Spaniards record with wonder that they never lied ! lint to return

to the historical: In later days Pliny, historian of Poinjjeii, mentions 
an expedition sent to "the Fortunate Islands," wliich brought back 
its "golden apples"' (oranges), and alludes to those wonderful dragon 

trees, whose age has been computed by 
Humboldt as not less than ](»,0()0 to 12,000 
years. One of these enormous trees stood 
within recent times at Orotava. It was the 
largest tree probably in the world, aiul 
was considered especially sacred. It Avas 
the meeting place of all the islanders on 
religious and political occasions. We 
give a sketch of it, which has been copied 
from a small original sketch in the museum 
at Las Palmas, taken before the tree was 
destroyed in 1808 by a storm. But before 
this nearly two-thirds of the tree had al- 
ready been cut 
down. (Fig.8.) 
And now for 
upward of thirteen hundred years after 
Pliny's account of them these islands are 
lost to sight, emerging again by their re 
discovery in the first years of the four- 
teenth century, when a Nornum of the 
name of Eethencourt once more visited 
their shores and took possession of them 
in the name of the King of Spain. - - - 
We would draw attention to the pecu- 
liarly Egyp- 
tian type of 
face of one of 

the women given in our sketches. (Fig. 9.) 
Both these women belong to cave-dwelling 
families, and thougli neither can be said to 
be a real Guanche, as none of that race 
now exist, still it can easily be seen in 
comparing them that the type has been 
transmitted in a nnu-h higher degree in 
the one than in the other. No one with 
ordinary observation can fail to be struck 
by the peculiarly "native" gait and ges- 
ture of the present dwellers in the caves. 
There is distinctly something nn-European 
in all their gestures, and they seem to have reverted to the modes 
of sitting, the expression of face, and possibly the voice of their 
Guanche ancestors, precisely as in the United States Ave see people

of pure British descent developing or reproducing tlie features and 
walk of the red Indian — the bigli clieelc bone, thin booked nose, arched 
instep, slouching gait, and nasal intonation. But alas! if the 
physical qualities of their Guaiiche ancestresses have been trans- 
mitted, tlieir purity and sweet gentleuess have not been so successfully 
handed down. 

When the Spanish invaded these islands they found a condition of 
affairs that must have been quite ideal and i)ossibly unique in tlie 
worhrs history. To the simplicity of the savage these people had added 
all the highest virtues; indeed, viewed from the standpoint of nine- 
teenth-century morality, it is a mere travesty to describe the customs 
and habits of the Guanches as in any way pertaining to Avhat we are 
pleased to consider as civilization. The men were brave, a lie was an 
unheard of crime, and the treachery and fraud of the Spaniards a revela- 
tion to them. The women were notoriously chaste. Men had but one 
wife, and paid the profoundest respect to their fathers. Their food was 
simple — the flesh of goats, with milk and i'ruit, and gotio (still the main 
food of the islands), which consists of tlie grain of barley crushed and 
roasted and mixed with milk or with water, according to their circum- 
stances. Life in every form was as precious as it is to a Brahmin, and 
they looked with horror on those whose vocation it was to destroy it. 
As is the case in China to this day, a butcher was an outcast, generally 
a criminal, who expiated the enormities of his crimes by having to 
imbue his hands in the innocent blood of animals. 

The consequence of this extended humanity was that the very birds 
of tlie air in these islands were tame, and the astonished Spaniards saw, 
not unmixed with awe and superstition, nature's most timid creatures 
playing amongst the feet of the children. These people liad no i)rofes- 
sional priests, and in consequence had no idols and no fetich. They 
believed in one Supreme Being, in future punishment and rewards, and 
all their God asked of them was a pure life and a reverent attitude of 
mind. 

Social problems among the Guanches seem to have been most admi- 
rably thought out. So as to insure an equality of wealth, the land was 
distributed at the death of the head of a family. There also existed a 
peculiar order of self-directing Sisters of jMercy among them, devoted 
to a simple life of nourishing the poor and needy, clad like all the rest 
in their garb of goatskin, and only distinguishable from their lay 
sisters by lives of abnegation. They remained vestal to the end ot 
their days, and were rightly esteemed to have merited, and were 
believed to have earned, the highest reward hereafter. And as there 
was no pelf for the priests, there was naturally no building set apart 
for mystic rites and ceremonies. They built dolmens, as we see 
them in. Wales, Cornwall, or at Stonehenge, and here the people 
assembled and knelt in circles with their hands lifted to heaven in 
silent x)rayer. • ^ ' 



THE GUANCHES. 549 

As regards the ancient language of the (hiancbes, it is generally 
accepted that the traces of it are very obscure. Very learned treatises 
have been written on the subject, with the usual result that most of 
these doctors disagree. That the Spaniards found several languages 
in existence is beyond doubt, and some authorities maintain that that 
spoken in the island of Tenerilie was the only true (xuanche language 
in existence at that time. But the most rational solution of this babel 
of tongues is that the languages spoken in the different islands were 
dialects of the same mother tongue, which tongue nnist have been of 
Berber origin. Sir Edmund Scory (temp. Elizabeth of England) says: 
" The language of the old Guanches, which remayneth to this day 
among them in this Ishiiid intlieir towne of (Jandehiria, alludeth much 
to that of the Moores of Barbary.'' The root of the language was 
Aryan, but it is, or has been, so intermixed and overlain by many 
others that very little of it is really known ; and that little is a very puz- 
zling subject to the philologist. Upward of a thousand words, how- 
ever, are known to us, and from these may be gained a very fair view 
of their religious, social, and moral tenets. Thus the word Acaman, 
also appearing as Atamam and Atuman, and meant indiflerently, (xod, 
the sky, or the sun, showing that the Giver of Light was their primi- 
tive conception of a God, the usual sun worship of all early religions. 
Another title of the Deity was Acquayaxercu-, or " The Sustainer of 
All," an exquisitely poetical desigiuition. Their belief had nothing in 
common with the Jehovistic idea. The Guanches seem to have had 
some dim idea that their God was part and parcel of His own works, 
inseparable from them — coexistent and coeternal with nature. This 
may be inferred from the fact that God was also known in Guanche as 
Ouarirari., or " The Indweller Of the Universe." But again, on the 
other hand, He was also known in one of the islands as Achahuerahcm, 
"God the Creator," bringing it back to the old difticulty. The word 
Achimaya^ "mother," is of special interest, as it seems to contain the 
germ root for that sweetest of all words in so many and widely diver- 
gent languages. There is clearly some connection between "maya" 
and mater, and the " niaia" of Buddha. Here, also, is a curious resem- 
blance: Haran, "a fern," which by the ordinary change of /( into/ 
becomes " faran." Gahuco, " a goat fold," resembles "caper " or " capra" 
in Latin. The name for the moon, Cel, seems to contain the germ of 
the Greek ae\r/vjj. Another curious resemblance is found in the word 
Mugadaj " a virgin;" Gothic, Magath ; old German, Magad ; modern 
German, Magd ; English, Maid. A ])refix to this word, Hari, meant a 
vestal virgin, Harimagada. Is this Hari the same word as the German 
Heilig f 

Perhaps an entire sentence may be of interest, for which, together 
with the preceding Guanche words, I am indebted to a paper on the 
language of the ancient natives of these islands by the Marquis of 
Bute: ^^Achoran, nun habec, Sahagua reste quagnat, sahur hanot gerage 



550 THE GUANCHES. 

sote,^^ which is translated : " I swear by the bone of him who has carried 
the crown to follow his example and to make the happiness of my sub- 
jects." '■'■Janaga quai/oeh, arcliimenceu no liaya dir luinUU) nahec chuiu/ra 
petut^^ — "The powerful Father of the Fatherland died and left the 
natives orphans." 

These sentences give an idea of the language to which these ancient 
races were accustomed, and also point out liow poetical were their 
ideas. 

In many respects this primitive language seems to have been singu- 
larly fortunate, for tlic Marquis of l>ute observes as to their verl)s, 
"There is only conjugation, and it seems to be beautifully developed, 
as though upon a purely logical basis, like an ideal generated from a 
philosopher's thought." 

As regards the cave dwellings, though many are scattered through- 
out all the ivshinds of the Canary group, the chief are at Atalaya, in the 
Grand Canary, about 7 miles from the port and town of Las Palmas. 
This City of Caves is situated on a ijeculiar-shaped lime and sandstone 
hill, which projects into a wild, rugged valley, overlooking a great 
expanse of country, the sea lying far below, and the main mountain 
range of the island, some 7,000 to 8,000 feet high, rising behind. The 
road to it, after leaving the modern and excellent Spanish carriage 
road, is rough and fatiguing, and is probably as ancient a track as has 
been ever trod by human feet. Over this road for countless tliousands 
of years these troglodytes have traveled on their way up from fishing 
in the sea or from the cultivation of the lower lands, and over these 
same tracks still travel their half-breed descendants in search of work 
in the towns and the vineyards. 

The liill of Atalaya forms two round heads, both honeycombed with 
ancient caves, which vary in size, tlie smallest not more than 8 to 10 
feet square and G feet high; the largest, with two apartments, both of 
which may measure 18 feet by 12 or 14, and 8 or 9 feet high. It is 
evident that in many cases existing natural caves were utilized, being 
squared off inside and shaped to suit the convenience of the inhabitants, 
but many others are entirely the work of man, scooped out with intinite 
pains from the solid sandstone rock. The most primitive races of all 
probably did none of this scooping, but were content to live in the 
natural caves in the same way as their simian brethren. 

Some idea of the extent of the cave communities may be formed when 
it is stated that even to this day, with many hundred caves empty or 
utilized as storehouses, there can not be less than 1,500 inhabtants in 
Atalaya, besides numbers of goats, i)igs, doidi:eys, and mu]<\s, who are 
also ijrovided with cave accommodation, without trespassing on the 
sleeping room of their masters, as in Ireland. Many of these cave 
rooms aie very comfortably furnished and are inviting to look at. Some 
are particularly clean, well whitewashed, and the Hoors thoroughly 
swept, whilst beds with snow-white covers and little tables with rough

lace work ou them for cloths, a few books, the inevitable Madonna, 
some candlesticks, and the alwa3^s picturesque pottery give an air of 
refinement that we may search for in vain in the coarse homes of too 
many of our own peasantry. As to the healthiness or comfort of these 
dwellings, of course it is a matter of habit. The only ventilation is the 
door, and as that is tight shut at night it seems difticult to understand 
how the people can breathe. There must also be a considerable disre- 
gard of les convenances as to their habits, for apparently both sexes 
of all ages occupy the same room. The sanitary arrangements, it need 
hardly be said, leave much to be desired. There is a staggering sim- 
plicity and freedom in their treatment. 

The present dwellers are very gentle and extremely ignorant. The 
men go out all day to look for work or work in their own little patches

of cultivation; small terraces of reclaimed land walled up below. The 
women all work at pottery, using no wheel, andreproducing the simpler 
liatterns, as aie found in the tombs of thousands of years ago. The 
clay used is very strong and has nuich adhesive power. It bakes into 
a fine dark red. They now never color their pottery, nor do they mark 
it with the stamps, as in the old days. Many of the best shapes are 
lost and those that remain are strictly utilitarian. 

As to their personal appearance, among these cave dwellers may 
often be seen strikingly handsome faces; their forms are good and 
their movements graceful. It has been said that they are often rude to 
visitors, and carry the importunity of begging (for they are insatiable 
beggars) to the limits of rudeness and menace. It certainly is unad- 
visable for ladles to go there alone.

Music appears to bo little known among tlieiu. Tliov have no ninsical 
instruments, and a])parent]y no airs that are popular in the sense of 
fjeneral. Still one hears them crooning away in a peculiarly melodious 
manner and always in a minor key. Some among the wealthier have 

elaborate costumes, which they don on Sun. 
day. The headdress (the handkerchief) is 
discarded on these occasions, and the hair 
is drawn back and tied in a lumj) behind, 
with large flowers placed low down on their 
necks, an arum iily, or a bunch of the wild 
geraniuin, which grows in such ])rofusion 
all over the 
islands. 

The periodi- 
cal baking of 
their potteiy is 
a great event among the cave dwellers. 
Large numbers of peoi)le sally forth for 
days before collecting brushwood of all 
kinds, and great heaps are jailed up in the 
open space before the public oven, where 
all the pottery to be bake<l is also collected. 
A roaring lire is soon produced, and the 
difierent i)ieces of jjottery are thrust into 
the flames, and are then moved about by 

means of a 
long pole of 
hai'd wood to 
insure their 
being evenly 

baked. Some kind of red glaze is put 
onto those which it is wished to decorate, 
but the greater part are baked witlumt 
any glazing matter. It is an extremely 
l)usy scene, with a great deal of shouting 
and screaming, everyone giving instruc- 
tions and orders, to which no one else 
pays the least attention. No one person 
seems to be in command, and all kinds of 
interloi)ers crowd in to give advice or to 
cram sticks into the oven. 

But the ancient Guanche pottery (se- 
lections from the collection in the museum of Las Palmas are here given) 
had much elegance, variety of form, and diversity of pattern. No. 1 is 
an example of an ordinary water jar, and No. 2 of a curiously shaped 
bowl with a handle. No. 3 is a fine double-handled water jar, 20 inches

bigli, witli a lid of the same wai-e. No. -1 is a small ornamented jar of 
the same cliaracter. No. 5 is a bowl 5 inches across, which is of much 
interest, as showing the iuflnence of early Etruscan art. Nos. G and 7 
are seals for stamping- early pottery ; they are made from lava. 

The other Guanche remains of which we give sketches are also taken 
from the same museum. They have 
not i>reviously, so far as we are aware, 
been figured in any book or journal, 
though similar objects are to be fmiud 
in several European museums. It is 
not a little remarkable and not very 
creditable that our great ethnologi- 
cal collection at the British Museum 
has not a single relic of the Guanche 
race. 

In this next group (fig. 14) No. 1 
represents a headdress or coronet 
worn by the ancient Guanche women. 
It consists of a wide thong of leather, 
upon which white shells are rudely riveted. No. 2 is a pestle and mortar. 
The mortar is of blue lias, and about a foot in diameter; the pestle is 
of a hard grayish-yellow stone. No. 3 represents a small stone hand- 
mill for grinding barley; it is 14 inches in diameter. 

In the upper part of the last sketch (fig. 15) are shown some sling 
stones, weighing from 4 to C ounces, as well as two hand-throwing 
stones, which weigh 1^ and 2 ])0unds respectively. Next to them is a 
sling of leather. The other articles are a variety of bone needles and 
a comb of hard wood.

PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION 



By Alfred Binet. 

Everyone of iis, whether aware of it or not, has experienced ilhisions 
of the senses; they do not always tell the truth. The eye, the ear, 
deceive us, and even the liand, that Ave instinctively extend to test the 
evidence of our other senses, has often played us false, though, to speak 
more accurately, it is the mind and not the senses that is at fault. 
The senses make known but one thing, the sensations. The eye merely 
communicates the different shades of light or color; the hand, sensa- 
tions of contact and movement. The mind interprets these sensations, 
draws conclusions, and with these conclusions constructs exterior 
objects endowed with numberless properties. When we say this is a 
chair, a table, a dog, a house, we not only indicate what the eye has 
perceived, but we reason it out. Y^et if this automatic and rapid 
reasoning be at fault we have had an illusion of the senses. 

Prestidigitation is an art which has in view a singular aim, that of 
seeking out and developing all iniluences which could lead us to be 
deceived in what we see. A person witnessing experiments in presti- 
digitation and understanding nothing of the means employed is easily 
made to believe that he sees an object in one part of the room when it 
is really elsewhere; he sees that which does not exist and sees not that 
which really does exist. 

One can readily understand the interest of the psychologist in the 
study of the means employed to produce these illusions, for it enlight- 
ens us as to the process by which the mind perceives exterior objects, 
and makes known likewise the weak points of our knowledge. Before 
entering into the details of our analysis it may be well to determine by 
certain general considerations the nature of the error produced by the 
art of the prestidigitator.^ 



'Translated from Eevue des Denx Mondes, October 15, 1894. 

-We have borrowed the principal elements of this study from the old works of 
Jacques Ozanan, Guyot, Decremps. Ponsiu, and from the more recent books of Robert 
Houdin. Some authors, Mr. James Sully (Illusions des Sens et de I'Esprit) and Mr. 
Max Dessoir (Open Court, 1893), have treated the question from a psychological 
point of view, and we have borrowed from them useful indications. We have above 
all tried to give the reader a clear idea of the performance of these tricks by con- 
sulting professionals and recjuesting them to execute before us, in different condi- 
ti<ms, tricks in which they very obligingly showed us that which they are in the 
habit of carefully concealing. We will cite with pleasure among these benevolent 

coadjutors Messrs. Aruould, Dickson, Melies, Pierre, and Raynaly.

556 PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION. 

I. 

Mr. James Sally, the einiueiit English i)sychologist, has made a 
distinction with regard to the illusions of the senses which presents 
real i)hilosophical value. The ilhisions of the senses, he says, should 
be divided into two categories, the active illusions and the passive 
illusions. The passive illusions are general; they are those M^hich are 
experienced under the same conditions by all individuals; they are 
inherent in our psychic organization, and no one can es(!ape them. It 
is a law that we see objects in a perpeudicuhir position, notwithstand- 
ing the fact that their image is reversed upon the retina of the eye. A 
stick plunged into the water has to us the appearance of being- broken. 
From these errors, common to all, we must distinguish those Mr. Sully 
calls active, those that are productions of the spontaneous activity of 
the mind ; these remain individual unless they take the epidemical form. 
They are the result of our temx)erament, the state of our mind and our 
belief. Hence it is by an active illusion that while awaiting a person 
on the roadway we fancy we recognize him in a person approaching" in 
the distance. 

Without going so far as to say that all belonging to the active illu- 
sions present a certain gravity, it must not be forgotten that it is 
illusions of this kind and not the others that are near relations to the 
hallucinations of madness. 

Unquestionably illusions of prestidigitation form a jiart of the pas- 
sive illusions, and, as it were, normal, which dominate all well-consti- 
tuted persons. Subsequent analysis will contirm this aflirnuition, in 
showing on which precise point the error of the senses bears. Mr. 
Max Dessoir has discusssed this question a propos of an interesting 
experience. He supposes an illusionist taking an orange, and after 
having shown it to those around him, throws it up into the air and 
then catches it in his hand as it descends. He repeats this i^erform- 
ance once, twice, and the third time, after having placed the orange in 
his pocket without the knowledge of those looking on, he makes a pre- 
tense of again throwing it up in the air. Mr. Dessoir thinks, and we 
think with him, that many of those present misled by this action would 
believe they again saw the orange being tossed into the air as on the 
two other occasions, and would be greatly astonished at not seeing it 
descend as they had reason to believe it would. What is the nature of 
the illusion in such a case! What name umst be given to it! To see 
an object in a place where in reality it is not, is an hallucination. Mr. 
Dessoir has good reason to discard this injudicious interpretation. The 
word hallucination, as we have frequently observed, must be used only 
with reference to an illusion that can have no explanation in exterior 
things; it is a disorder of the senses, not a normal error. If the spec- 
tators believe they see the orange, then they yield, as we will explain, 
to a pretense on the part of the conjurer; they give themselves up to 



PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION, 557 

the illusion, without troubliug themselves to iiivesti.iiate it, which 
would only destroy the ap])earauce and therefore the pleasure. 

It must be observed that the greater part of these illusions which 
owe their existence to the art of prestidigitation must have for a neces- 
sary condition the cooperation of the public, or at least their willingness 
to oblige. 

The public do not go to the prestidigitators for the purpose of pick- 
ing- to pieces, as it were, a scientific experiment. They ask only one 
thing — to be deceived; that is to say, to experience that astonishment, 
that slight cloudiness of ideas or intellect which the sight of a phe- 
nomenon contrary to all natural laws excites within us. In order that 
this particular mental state should be produced one must give one's 
self up to the illusion, and not endeavor to lay hold of the mechanism 
which produces it. If by chance we discover the secret of the trick 
we must keep the discovery to ourselves, as propriety demands. We 
would not dream of such a thing as questioning the prestidigitator 
while in the exercise of his profession, nor of taking precaution to see 
through his magical performances. If the magician jdaces his hands 
behind his back at a critical moment we would not call out to him 
as did the fox in the fable, "I beseech of you, sir, turn round."' The 
reserve of the first instance comes from a sentiment of discretion; 
that of the other from a certain timidity. These illusionists are well 
aware of this; as for instance when they wish to have a certain card 
chosen from the jiack they invariably address themselves to a lady, as 
a woman is much more given to reserve than a man; and should she 
perceive the fraud, she dare not raise her voice to demand an explana- 
tion for fear of attracting attention to herself; her timidity makes her 
the artist's accomplice. For that matter the magician has more than 
one means of mastering a skeptical and unyielding public. In perform- 
ing a trick he goes through one part of it before one person and to 
complete it he turns to another who has as yet seen nothing of the 
first part. It is necessary for the same person to witness the entire 
trick in order to understand how it is done. Thus one person is made 
to mark a piece of money and another farther awaj- is to keep it, who, 
not having seen it marked, is not aware that it has been changed. 

With regard to those who are requested to come upon the stage in 
order to examine closely the actions of the magician, they exercise a 
control essentially deceptive. The prestidigitator takes particular 
care only to choose those from the audience whose countenance express 
artlessness and simplemindedness, when they are not confederates. 
The magician allows these witnessess to see only as much as it is 
convenient for him to have them see; they are also at liberty to do, 
whether they be aware of it or not, only that which he wishes them to 
do, and can not undertake to find out anything for themselves without 
the artist's permission. This is the conclusion arrived at lately in a 
cunoas conteBt. One of the audience wished absolutely to knpw what

was going on behind a screen, and on being called upon the platform 
he raised the screen, and iiiiniediately great excitement was evinced 
on the part of the artist and his assistants; a hand-to-hand combat 
ensued, and it ended in a law suit. The audacious offender was made 
to pay heavy damages for having exceeded the rights the magician 
had granted him. One may judge by this example how difficult it 
would be to make scientific observations at a public representation. 
Notwithstanding the difficulties of control, the i)ublic is the dui)e of 
the illusions presented to him only in a certain degree, as he considers 
the fact that he is attending a seance of prestidigitation; if it is 
impossible for him to understand the secret of a trick, this would not 
be a reason for him to believe that the laws of nature had been over- 
thrown. Should a nutmeg appear suddenly as if it sprang from the 
artist's linger ends, witliout the spectator being able to understand 
how it was done, he would not from this believe it possible for nut- 
megs to spring" from one's finger ends. The illusion exists, we may say, 
only for the sense of sight ; our reason contradicts it. 

II. 

In seeking to analyze the different processes by which the illusion is 
i:»roduced in these feats of sleight of hand, and the si)ectator prevented 
from discovering the truth, we find it most difficult to give clear and 
satisfactory definitions, as there exists not only one process, but many, 
and they are of a very complicated nature. The illusion of each trick 
is not merely the result of one single cause, but of many, so insignifi- 
cant that to perceive them would be quite as difficult as to count with 
the naked eye the grains of sand on the seashore. I will not enter too 
much into detail, but will confine myself to exposing the principal arti- 
fices resorted to by the prestidigitator. The illusions of the senses 
which we will study may be divided into two principal groups, positive 
and negative. Modern researches in hypnotism have familiarized us 
with the term and with the phenomena they indicate. We know that 
the positive illusions with which we will begin our description consist 
in seeing that which does not exist; they give rise to appearances with- 
out reality. Persons in a hypnotic state have these illusions; they are 
one of the very first steps of this artificial condition of the mind. 

A person hypnotized can be commanded to see anything by the per- 
son who hypnotizes him. For instance, he says: " Here is a bird!" in 
a persuasive or commanding tone of voice. Immediately the subject 
imagines a bird is in the room; he sees it, he touches it, he hears it 
sing, catches hold of it with awkward but expressive gestures, and goes 
through other like performances caused by the suggestion of a bird- 
We cite this example of hypnotic illusion because there is a resemblance 
between it and the illusions of the prestidigitator by the important fact 
of its being the result of the influence of one mind over another. But 



PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION. 559 

lay aside this fundamental resemblance and wliat a difference we find 
between the two oases! When we wish to surround a hypnotized 
person with dlusions the operation is one of the greatest simplicity. 
We merely pronounce a word in an authoritative tone to make the 
illusion a reality to him. "Here is a bird," we say, and without further 
explanation the subject sees a bird as if it were in reality present. The 
prestidigitator must resort to a more subtle means of arriving at the 
same end; he must deceive the spectators without their being aware of 
the deception that is being i)racticed upon them. 

The first necessary condition for all these operations is holding the 
attention of the audience. Before commencing a trick the operator 
should endeavor to have the attention of each one of the spectators, in 
order that their minds may enter into relation with his. This is what 
in hypnotism is called "entrer en rapport," giving a convenient term to 
a phenomenon the existence of which is certain, but the nature of which 
it would be most difficult to define. We all know how to attract and 
retain the attention of a person with whom we wish to speak. It is 
instinct with us. We were never taught the different insignificant 
means employed to arrive at this end, such as raising the voice, placing 
the hand upon the shoulder, or making use of an interjection. We all 
know that a great deal depends upon the personality of the individual; 
for instance, there are some who find it impossible to hold the attention 
of an audience or even of an individual, while there are others who by 
the mere utterance of a few words, such as "I do not know" or "I beg 
pardon," command immediate attention. The prestidigitator who has 
doubtless never reflected upon the means he uses to hold his audience, 
nevertheless knows well how to exercise this influence to attract the 
eyes and close attention of everyone present to his hands, his eyes, or 
to whatever j^art of his body it is necessary for his project that they 
should be attracted. 

Robert Houdin makes an observation the truth of which will be 
readily recognized by those who are accustomed to speak in public and 
to enter into communication with a large concourse of individuals. 
He says that the first and most important quality of the prestidigitator 
is to possess a steady eye; certain people have a timid, vague expression, 
and while conversing with them should one look them frankly and 
steadily in the face they feel embarrassed and turn away their heads as 
if they dreaded the intimacy of such looks. This timidity of expression 
is contagious; it is a great stumbling-block to conversation, and pre- 
vents the orator from exercising any influence over his hearers. The 
Ijrestidigitator, says Robert Houdin, must have a frank, bright, pene- 
trating glance, which he must concentrate boldly upon the eyes of the 
spectators in such a manner that their eyes become riveted on his, and 
a feeling of mutual sympathy arises. When the artist accomplishes 
this he can at will turn the eyes of his audience in whatever direction 
he sees fit. 



560 PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION. 

The meaus employed to produce positive illusions is the making use 
of feiut or pretense. 

The feigning of an action is the mere outline of the action. A feint 
is made of taking something from the table; the hand is extended 
toward the table as if to remove the object. A feint is made of throwing 
an orange into the air, when in reality it is still retained in the hand. 
Feigning an action consists in performing only the first part of a well 
known and exj^ressive action, and the end is con(;ealed; the hand is 
hidden, for example, behind a table, a screen, or behind the body dur- 
ing this second part of the act, which must be executed with dexterity. 
The S])ectator not anticipating anything of the sort, haviug seen the 
first part of the action completed, but not the second, although he is 
not aware of it, believes the oi)eration to be correctly and completely 
executed. The psychologist is not at a loss to explain the mechanism 
of these operations, which rests upon the laws of habit or the laws of 
association of ideas. When one of two actions or two perceptions, 
which as a rule follow one another, presents itself to oiu- eyes, our mmd 
is so constructed that the presence of the one act, or the one perception, 
irresistibly suggests the other. From the time we perceive the first 
act we suppose the second, because it is the logical consequence, or 
simply the habitual accompaniment. We do more than suppose it; we 
represent it so vividly to ourselves we believe we see it. 

These explanations are more directly applicable to sleight of hand, 
which is the basis of prestidigitation. Sleight of hand consists in com- 
pletely concealing an object in a sudden and brusque manner before 
the astonished gaze of the lookers on and in giving the idea that it was 
suddenly transferred to a certain place, when in reality it has not been 
removed. The prestidigitator takes an object in his right hand, a piece 
of cork, an egg, a piece of money, it matters not what, provided it can 
be easily handled. He holds the object up to view and then makes a 
pretense of slipping it into his left hand, and he imitates the action so 
cleverly that everyone jiresent is persuaded that it is no longer in his 
right hand, but re[)osing in his left. Not only are they persuaded that 
he has made the exchange, but they fully believe that they saw him do 
it, and more than one will be willing to vouch for tlie truth of it on the 
testimony of their eyes. The illusion for those who do not know how 
it is done and have not attempted to analyze it is absolutely irresist- 
ible. It misleads not only children and ignoramuses, but grown men 
and renowned scholars. I myself have kno",vn men accustomed to 
scientific observation comi)letely duped by tliese tricks. The savages, 
as Eobert Houdin relates, do not escape these illusions any more than 
the civilized inhabitants of the globe, and they explain them to them- 
selves in attributing to the prestidigitator a .supernatural power. Even 
animals, we may add, are sensible of these illusions. I have frequently 
experimented upon dogs by juggling away sugar plums, which excites 
their interest sufficiently to make them attentive to the tricks. 



PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION. 561 

The art of sleight of hand is not dependent upon caimce, but is gov- 
erned by fixed laws known for more than a hundred years, and which 
can no longer be modified. Xowadays one learns to juggle Just as 
to dance or to play upon the piano. The manipulation of the fingers 
is most complicated, and to be able to i)erform these feats without the 
assistance of a box, or a string, with only one's own dexterity to aid, 
is the highest aim of the prestidigitator. It is not only necessary to 
practice before the looking glass for days or weeks, it re<iuires years to 
become an expert in this art. We do not consider it as straying from 
our subject in thus giving a rather minute description of this sleight 
of hand J the illusiojis which are the result are purely psychological. 
Many people believe the magician conceals the objects he makes use of 
in his sleeves; this false opinion has been frequently contested, but 
it is nevertheless tenacious. The truth of the matter is that apart 
from such experiments as the "vanishing cage," etc., the sleeves are 
rarely used by professionals. One of the most famous conjurers, 
Bosco, worked with his arms perfectly bare. 

Almost every operation consists in retaining the object in one hand 
and making believe it is resting in the palm of the other. 

It is necessary for a prestidigitator to practice a very long time before 
he becomes an expert in thus retaining objects in his hand. He begins 
by practicing with small objects, such as nutmegs, dimes, nickels, small 
corks, and afterwards with more voluminous objects, as billiard balls 
and eggs. There are different ways of retaining the objects in the 
palm of the hand with the hand open ; and the professionals distin- 
guish several different ways of accomplishing this feat. Sometimes 
the palm of the hand is alone used, and at others the first joints of the 
fingers. A nutmeg, for instance, can be held between the root of the 
middle finger and that of the ring finger, and there are many other 
ways; each' one has his preference. The difficulty appears to be to slip 
the object supposed to disap])ear to the iilace where it is to beheld. It 
is held up at first for the inspection of the audience between two fingers, 
and these fingers should move slowly so as to propel the object into its 
place of concealment. 

The number of objects that can be held in the palm depends greatly 
upon circumstances; it varies as the objects are real or imitation, 
whether they are attached together by a cord, whether they have been 
juggled, whether the wand or a handkerchief must be held in the hand, 
or whether the hand nuist be open or be half closed. 

In the trick that is called "hunting the pieces" (la chasse aux 
pieces), twelve pieces at one time are held in the hand, but the hand 
is almost closed. A good prestidigitator can hold in his hand at once 
five 5-franc pieces with the hand hanging loosely at his side in a per- 
fectly natural position and with which he is able to gesticulate, " couper 
le jeu," etc. This being granted, we will now give a coniplete descrip- 
tion of a feat of sleight of hand, chosen from among several varieties. 
SM 94 36 



562 PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION. 

I borrow this description from Ponciii, who is really the classical author 
of this art: ''Take a regular juggler's ball (small size) between the 
thumb and index iinger of tlie right hand. Ber.d the index finger, 
wliich will make it draw back and cause the ball to roll a little, which 
ought then to rest upon the first joint of the middle finger. Bring the 
ring finger inside the hand so as to make a greater .space between it 
and the middle finger. Roll the ball with the thumb into the space, 
raise the ring finger, and the ball should be then just between the 
joints of the middle and ring fingers and near the roots of both." 

This tri(;k will never be perceived, because it is invisible to the audi- 
ence, the back of the hand being turned toward them, and although 
the object is in the palm, the hand appears relaxed expressive of inac- 
tivity and repose. But what would augment the illusion considerably, 
and give it even an irresistible effect, is tliat while juggling the ball 
in the right hand we make a gesture as if placing it in the left hand; 
we then bring both hands together, describing a half circle if it be 
necessary to augment tlie distance, and therefore give more time to the 
securing of the ball in the j^alm, and as soon as the fingers of the right 
hand touch the palm of the left hand, we close the left hand, as if 
holding an object which we did not wish to let fall. This gesture suf- 
fices to make those looking on believe the object is really in the left 
hand; and the illusion will be all the more perfect if the artist shows 
himself a good comedian. Our advice is to repeat the act frequently 
before a mirror in order to become expert in its performance. More- 
over, the effect of the act is increased by the words with which he 
accompanies it, his affirming that tbe object is in his left hand, the 
manner of looking at his leit hand, and, in fact, his whole expression 
of countenance, all go to increase the force of the illusion. Of course 
it is necessary not to overdo it by putting too much zeal in the action 
of the hand, or wearing an unnatural expression of countenance, as 
this woukl only arouse suspicion in the minds of the audience. 

There exists another artifice, to which we may have recourse to 
heighten the effect of the trick, wliich is for the artist to treat his audi- 
ence to a little set si)eech he has all prepared for the occasion, and 
which has on the minds of the audience an effect most favoi-able to the 
illusion. If the artist announced beforehand that a nutmeg would 
disappear while he was bringing both hands together their eyes would 
become so fixed on the movements of his hands as to cause him no little 
embarrassment, and no doubt some among them would perceive the 
fraud. To throw them off" the scent, he envelops the trick in a sort of 
mystery. He announces to them, for example, that by squeezing a nut- 
meg in his right hand he has the power to melt it, and cause it to 
evaporate and disapj)ear; everyone present, of course, knows this to 
be impossible, but such is the power of the human speech that we are 
almost compelled to give our best attention to the act the magician 
announces he is about to perform, and in consequence we keep a close 



PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION. 563 

watch on his right hand when he finishes jnggling, but while he was 
Juggling and making a ])retense of passing the nutmeg into the right 
hand, when he was holding it secretly in the left hand, we had only 
looked on mechanically. This part of the oi>eration remained in 
shadow, as it were; it is perceived in a semiconscious manner, as an 
act void of all importance, and the illusion that results becomes all 
the stronger, no one being aware of the exact moment in which it was 
produced. 

All these details go to show that positive illusions produced by a 
pretense or feint have peculiar qualities of their own ; the illusion is not 
a durable one, as that of the bent stick in the water — the false appear- 
ance lasts only for a moment. We would not say, while looking on at 
the performance, "I see the ball passing from one hand to the other;" 
we would say "I saw it; I am positive that it passed"— an illusion of 
memory rather than of the senses. 

III. 

We meet with another class of illusions in the tricks of the presti- 
digitators, to which we may give the name of negative illusions, in 
contrast with the preceding ones. The first and best examines of 
these singular illusions have been made known to us through hypnotic 
experiments. These illusions consist in not seeing, in not hearing, 
in not feeling, and which abolish the perception, be it either of an 
object or of a class of objects. We place, for instance, before the 
person hypnotized a real, material, tangible object. Suppose it to be 
a person assisting at the experiment; the subject is commanded not 
to see this i^erson, and the commaiul is sufficient to cause the disaii- 
pearance of the person — of his becoming invisible, as it were. This last 
class of illusions is much more difficult to understand than the first. 
Authors have not given, it must be admitted, a perfectly satistactory 
explanation of it. We do not kno\v what is taking i^lace in the mind 
of the subject hypnotized who is commanded not to see a person imme- 
diately in front of him. We have difficulty in understanding the proc- 
ess by which the person hypnotized, while being perfectly sincere 
with himself and not in any way "making believe" or endeavoring to 
play a joke, can arrive at that state of not being able to see a person 
immediately in front of him with whom he is well acquainted. ISTegative 
illusions are frequent in seances of iirestidigitation ; we will endeavor 
to ascertain how a person perfectly sane and in possession of all his 
faculties is prevented from seeing objects placed immediately before 
his eyes. 

The objects from which it is necessary to divert the attention of the 
lookers-on vary according to circumstances. In certain feats it is a 
corner of the conjurer's table. In other tricks it is a goblet or a pa(;k of 
cards. As a rule it is the hands of the prestidigitator himself, to which 
the too close attention of the audience must not be given. It must be

understood that it is uot always an easy matter to escape the vigilant 
watch of the spectators. They come to the performance to see, and 
from the moment the cnrtain rises and the artist appears on the stage 
all eyes are riveted upon him, and as he is entirely surrounded by light, 
how is it possible to prevent the spectators from directing their atten- 
tion to the particular spot where tlie illusion is to be produced? 

To accomplish this the prestidigitator has recourse to a psychologi- 
cal law, of which he no doubt knows nothing, ;ind Avhich he has never 
heard explained. Prestidigitation rests on psychology. We have just 
shown hoAv the law of association of ideas explains positive illusicms. 
Those that come under the head of negative illusions are explained l)y 
this other law, which can be exjn^essed thus: We have a tendency to 
perceive only exterior objects which attract our attention. All percep- 
tion is optional with us; numerous sensations are constantly vibrating 
our organs of sense; we neglect the greater part of them, because they 
are of no interest; we fix our attention only on certain ones, the signifi- 
cant ones; these alone traverse the threshold of our mind; they become 
the objects of our reasoning, suggest to us past events, and ])lay a part 
in our interior life. Although each one's individual attention is more 
particularly attracted by this or by that, for instance, this one is apt to 
be more observant of forms, that one of color, and so on, yet there are 
certain rules of i^erception Avhicli are general; a priori we can desig- 
nate certain objects which command our whole attention and certain 
others which are only i^erceived with the corner of the eye and neg- 
lected and quickly, forgotten. This uniformity of reactions before the 
same spectacles is known to i)restidigitatioii and it profits by it. When 
it is i)articularly important that certain peculiarities of a trick be not 
observed, even in the broad light, matters are so arranged that the 
attention of the spectators is drawn to another point at the decisive 
moment or an appearance of insignificance is given to the act, which 
produces a relaxation of attention. The attention is thus distracted 
and deadened; these are the two principal means of rendering invisible 
a spectacle which is perfectly visible to all eyes. 

The distraction of the attention will be easily understood by a few 
examples. When the eyes of all the spectators are directed toward 
the artist he may easily divert their attention to another point by him- 
self looking in a perfectly natural manner toward this point; should 
he turn to the right all the spectators will obediently follow his gaze. 
It is understood, though, he must uot turn too (piickly; it is best 
to make the movement sh)Avly and naturally. This is the A B O of 
the art. Should the artist wish to play a trick with the right hand let 
him turn toward the left; to conceal a movement made by the left hand 
he must turn to the right. Thus the attitude of his body indicates to 
the spectators in which direction their attention should be directed. 
The mere fact of speaking causes the removal of attention. Mr. Max 
Dessoir has already observed that when the artist takes up a pack of 



PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION. 565 

cards all eyes are fixed upon liis hands; let liim speak and immediately 
every eye Hies to his face and give his hands the opportunity of profit- 
ing- by the occurrence to go through maneuvers which are witnessed 
by no one. 

There is still even a surer method of diverting the eyes and attention 
of the spectators by performing some act which of itself will interest 
them or hold their attention. In tricks of importance some such 
movement is always arranged beforehand. For instance, an object is 
de])osited in an impressive manner on the corner of the table, and 
the artist announces that this object will be used in the execution of 
the trick. Suppose it to be a hat through which he jiroposes to pass a 
handful of silver; irresistibly all eyes become riveted on the hat and do 
not see the hand which in the meantime lays hold of an object concealed 
behind the table in a secret pocket or drawer; or he announces that he 
will make an object appear upon a certain iiiece of furniture on which 
he taps with the magic stick and gives a little discourse similar to this 
one Robert Iloudin delivered : " You all doubtless are aware of the 
power of the magic wand, with which one has merely to tap gently 
upon an object in order to cause to appear whatever one wishes; behold, 
for example, we will try to make it produce not here (he taps the table 
with the stick), but here (he taps his hand) a crystal ball; here it is!" 
ITis object in tapping on the table Avas to attract the attention of the 
audience to the table, so they will not see his hand which he places in 
his pocket for the purpose of getting the ball, which he keeps hidden 
in his palm until the desired moment. There is a simpler method of 
diverting the attention of the audience without using the magic wand, 
a mere remark on the part of the prestidigitator is sufficient. A pres- 
tidigitator writes me: " In a little discourse which I deliver with great 
seriousness, I exclaim, in designatnig a certain place at a distance from 
my table: 'Authentic i)ieces, which are not here, demonstrate with 

evidence ■^' At these words, 'which are not here,' the eyes of the 

spectators turn from me to look where I tell them there is nothing." 
The diverting of the eyes is still more certain and even necessary and 
fatal when the artist takes the precaution to perform some little inter- 
esting act. I borrow this novel example from Eobert Houdin. The 
prestidigitator declares he is about to divide a glass ball in two. This 
ball, he affirms, showing it, is of pebble; it is heavy and very hard; but 
hard as it is he hopes to divide it. During this time he throws the 
ball up in the air and catches it in its descent to attract the attention 
of the spectators. " It would be an impossibility," observes Robert 
Houdin, " for the eyes of the audience not to follow it in its ascension." 

In the same order of ideas we will cite some experiments which take 
place in succession, one after the other, in order to enable the artist to 
prepare the following experiment at the very moment when the whole 
attention of the audience is fixed upon the trick which has just been 
concluded. 



566 PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION. 

Ill an amusing trick, called the birtli of flowers, the prestidigitator 
makes bouquets appear in different objects, in his buttonhole, in a box, 
in a glass, in a hat; and at the moment that the tlowers appear in one 
of these objects, and the audience is suffused with admiration and won- 
der, the prestidigitator profits by their attention being directed from 
him and places a bouquet in the next object to which he wishes to call 
their attention. 

In fact, in many tricks played with cards in which it is necessary for 
one of the spectators to choose a card, it is customary to ask him a 
question which will necessitate his answering, and thus for a moment 
divert his attention from the hands of tlie artist. Mr. Arnould gives a 
curious example: "In a little trick with cards, which I have submitted 
to you," he writes us, "it is necessary for me to know the fourth card 
of the i>ack; everyone is looking at my hands; I am sitting down; 
there is no means of turning my body in order to conceal the movement 
I wish to make from the audience (the oj)eration consists in gently 
raising the card in order to see its face) ; there is no pretext for ray 
touching the cards. I hold myself in readiness and put this point- 
blank question to the spectator immediately in front of me: 'Can you 
count up to GO?' The person addressed of course looks at me in 
amazement, not exactly knowing how to take my question; the others 
in the audience, much amused, look in his direction ; this all occupies 
about one second, ample time for rae to look at the card." 

The greatest variety of tricks can be i)layed in this manner. We 
will leave it to the ingenious mind to discover new ones. The presti- 
digitator has very seldom to himself invent; the tricks he plays are 
like the classical pieces at the Theatre Fran^'ais, accompanied by tra- 
ditions which indicate in the minutest possible manner what is to be 
done at a given moment to remove the gaze of the spectators, and the 
means are so powerful that scarcely anyone escapes their influence. 

Instead of diverting the attention there are ways of making the audi- 
ence lose interest just when the most important and decisive part of 
the trick is being accomplished, and the means emjiloyed are numerous. 
In certain cases to hide a movement, it must be made brusquely, by 
surprise, so that no one would have time to prepare attention ; the 
movement must be so rai)id that the eye will have no time to follow it 
in detail. There are some interesting observations to make on the 
tricks of dexterity. Certain tricks jierformed by the hands appear as 
perfect enigmas when they are performed with great rapidity. Mr. 
Raynaly performed at our laboratory "le saut de coup des deux mains," 
and such was the rapidity with which he accomplished this trick and 
such the force of the illusion that after having seen him repeat it 
twenty times not one present could detect the secret. JNIr. Ivaynalyheld 
in his hands a pack of cards; he first made us notice that the bottom 
card was a face card, for instance, the king of hearts; when suddenly 
we perceived a slight movement of the hands and there before our eyes 



PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION. 567 

the king was transformed into the ace of spades. There were four of 
us j)resent — men accustomed to observation. We were dumfounded 
and absohitely unable to understand how it was accomplished. The 
disappearance of the cage was also performed for our benefit by Mr. 
Arnould. This trick also produced a most curious illusion, though not 
so forcible as the iireceding one. We can not dispute the fact that the 
rapidity with which the movement is made is the cause of its invisi- 
bility. The proof is that should the artist consent to go through the 
operation slowly we would have no difficulty in detecting the mechan- 
ism. But at the same time it must be observed that the question is 
very complex. The invisibility is not dei)endent solely upon the short 
duration of the sensation received l)y the eye. Numerous experiments 
have been made in late years in order to measure the time necessary 
to perceive a letter or a color. The experiment has been made by 
placing the observer behind an aperture, the opening and closing of 
which can be regulated. To perceive and recognize a letter it requires 
some hundredths part of a second. In witnessing a trick the dilSculty 
of perception is even greater than to recognize a- letter or color, for we 
must be able to understand and divine the mechanism of an act often 
very complicated, as " le saut de coup des deux mains." The time this 
operation occupies, though much longer than would be necessary for 
us to perceive a color (it occupies fifteen hundredths of a second), is 
not sufficient for the spectator to grasp it. There are, then, two causes 
which concur to i^roduce the illusion — the rapid movements of the 
hands and the comi^licated and inexplicable character of the operation. 
From the time this second cause of the illusion is done away with the 
illusion disappears. The artists, whose names I have just mentioned, 
having been good enough to decompound their movements, I could 
afterwards, when they went through the trick with their accustomed 
rapidity, account for each movement of their hands; I saw the move- 
ment because I had learned to know it, and consequently I knew the 
exact points to which I should pay the most attention. 

It is by considerations of this sort that we explain what I will call 
"the screen system." There are an indefinite number of tricks in which 
to render an object invisible we hide it entirely, absolutely, by placing 
it behind another object Avhich forms a screen. At first sight it seems 
impossible that the spectators do not suspect the artifice. But they do 
not, as in everyday life we are constantly losing sight of the object at 
which we are looking, and we fill up these short eclipses of the object 
by a rapid reasoning; if, for instance, while watching a little child 
playing at ball we suddenly lose sight of its hand, it would seem ridic- 
ulous for us to conclude that the child had suddenly become one-handed. 
A detailed mental inuige which remains constantly alive completes the 
sensation and prevents our taking note of the gaj). The artifice of the 
prestidigitator consists in taking advantage of such gaps; he surrounds 
himself with certain material conditions which, for a very short sx)ace

of time, bide his bauds or tbe objects be bolds, witbout our iu)ticiug 
tbe iuterruptiou iu tbe course of our perceptiou, aud it is duriug- tbese 
iuterru])tious tbat tbe decisive act is executed. 

Let us suppose, for example, that tbe prestidigitator in a certaiu 
trick wishes to substitute one card for another, wliicb is called "tiler la 
carte." To couceal this operation be proceeds as follows: Ue stands 
not behind tbe table, but in front of it, between tbe audience and the 
table, which of course necessitates his turning a little when bo phices 
the card upon the table. This slight cbange of position conceals his 
hand and enables him to change tbe cards. There are many secret 
movements made by tbe i^restidigitator on returning to the stage after 
having been among the audience. His back being turned, it is very 
easy for bun to substitute other objects for those confided to him. 
Often, also, the artist arranges matters so that at a certain part of the 
trick it become necessary for him to go to the other end of the hall in 
order to procure an important object, and during this time tbe substi- 
tution is made; sometimes, also, to give himself more time, be pretends 
to be eagerly looking for something which he has not in reality let fall. 
Tbere is a trick during which i)reteiided search a watch is wrapped iu 
paper and placed m a double-bottomed box. Better still, the substi- 
tution can be made by confiding the object to an aid and then asking 
him for it again. For instance, it is a live bird with which we have 
just concluded a trick; we give it over to the "servant,"' telling him to 
replace it in its cage, and then, as if on second thought, we say, "No; 
baud me the bird; I wish to use it in a new trick." The aid, who 
has bad his back turned for one moment, and, moreover, whose move- 
ments no one thought of watching, has made the exchange. A live bird 
was given to him; he gives in its i)lace a dead one, and afterwards the 
spectators will be astonished to perceive the substitution, inasmuch as 
they fully believed tbat tbe bird bad not been out of their sight. 
Another example of substitution similar to the preceding one: An 
object has been borrowed by tbe magician, which he Avrajis up under 
the spectators' eyes, and he wishes to replace it by a similar object — 
tbat is to say, similar only in appearance, as it is one of his "trick" 
objects which he has secretly placed in the crown of a hat. The pres- 
tidigitator says simply: "I place the object in this hat; or, rather, I 
will confide it to this person." In saying the first words he rapidly 
introduces the little object into the hat and takes out the one already 
there. He does the act in a careless, negligent way, even avoiding 
casting his eyes into the hat, and tbe consequence is that when he 
changes his mind the spectators are not aware of the secret action. 

In many tricks it is convenient to hide the hand at times behind a 
screen or some other object. Should we wish to relieve ourselves of a 
handkerchief, for instance, which we have in our hand, we draw near 
an armchair and let tbe handkerchief fall behind it, Mithout the audi- 
ence knowing that the chair has for a moment hidden the x)restidigi-

tator'!^ hand and he has profited by it. The table whicli the artist uses 
is of the greatest service to screen his liands. This table is nearly 
always j)iovided with a pocket and other contrivances on the side turned 
from the audience, in which the objects he wishes to make disappear 
fall without the slightest noise, and from which objects can be taken 
without the knowledge oi tliose looking on. The prestidigitator j^asses 
his hand carelessly m making a gesture, and, without arresting the 
movement behind the table, takes the object from the pocket or relieves 
himself of it, as the trick requires. This process is so simple that it 
suffices to mention it to have it understood; but one would never 
suspect the services it can render. It is very easy when one has confi- 
dence in one's self to place the hand which holds the object unaffectedly 
on the edge of the table; one has only to open the fingers slightly and 
the object falls noiselessly into the jjocket, and the trick is done. The 
simpler the means the less suspicion it arouses. 

There are even cases when we may conceal an object as large as 
15 centimeters in diameter. This object, which is called a "bullet," 
is of black hard wood; it is hollow, and has in it a little hole just 
large enough to pass the finger through. The bullet, which should 
be filled with all sorts of objects beforehand, should be surreptiti- 
ously introduced into a hat borrowed from one of the audience, in order 
that the prestidigitator may transform it into a horn of plenty. It is 
not an easy matter to conceal the ball on account of its dimensions; 
but the hat is used for the purpose of covering it and no one perceives 
it. Behold how Robert Houdin describes this classical trick : " The hat 
is held in the right hand with four fingers only, tlie middle being left 
at liberty. The operator goes behind the table, at the same time talking 
and gesticulating in such a way with the hand that holds the hat that 
the hand becomes reversed and jilaced a little above the ball or bullet. 
In this position the left arm is pnt forward on one pretext or another 
to take something from the front of the table. In accordance with this 
movement the body comes forward a little, and the right hand is lowered 
to the level of the table; the middle finger is then inserted in the 
bullet, raises it. and introduces it subtly into the hat,'' Necessarily 
the spectators can not suspect any of these maneuvers, which are made 
under the hat and which are hidden from them, A curious feature is 
that the spectators do not perceive that the aperture of the hat has 
been hidden for a moment, and the artist has profited by it to introduce 
something into it. Another manner of concealing objects frequently 
resorted to is in passing them from one hand to another. Should we 
wish to introduce a box, a pupi^et — no matter what the object happens 
to be — into a handkerchief just borrowed from one of the audience, 
the handkerchief is held in the left hand, the object is held in the right, 
and with a very natural gesture the handkerchief is passed into the 
right hand, or the object in the same way placed in the left. The 
gesture is so insiguiticaut that it awakens no susi)icion; and, on the 



570 PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION. 

other liaud, it is impossible for the spectator to see the trick, as the 
hand remains constantly closed. 

The magic wand is of great service in tricks of this kind, as the very 
fact that the wand is in the hand is reason enough for the hand 
remaining partly closed, and therefore making it jwssible to conceal 
many objects in its palm. Moreover, the prestidigitator does not hold 
the wand in his hand all the time; when it becomes necessary for 
him to use both his hands in presenting an object to the view of the 
spectators, he lays his magic stick on the table; a moment afterwards 
he takes it up and raps with it as a signal that the illusion is about to 
take place. These movements appear to have so little significance 
that the spectators have not only neglected to look at them but they 
don't really perceive them. IsTevertheless, they are decidedly impor- 
tant. In placing the wand on the table the prestidigitator relieves 
himself of the embarrassing object; taking up the wand, he possesses 
himself of another object. The lookers-on have seen nothing and sus- 
pect nothing.

The preceding analysis demonstrates how very difficult it is, even for 
an intelligent observer, to see everything that takes place in front of 
him. To see everything it is not oidy necessary to open the eyes wide, 
for the human eye is not like the photographer's ])late, which reflects 
without discernment all the details of the reality. The mental percep- 
tion of objects is subjected to intlueuces which cause certain objects 
to be seen correctly, others not to be perceived, and still others 
which do not exist are so vividly imagined that we believe we see 
them. To complete our study we thought it would prove interesting 
to have recourse to photography, which to-day is the natural, almost 
indisi^ensable, accomi^animent of visual observation. Thanks to the 
cooperation of Mr. Georges Uemeny, Professor Marey's clever assist- 
ant, we have not been compelled to content ourselves with one or two 
isolated examples. Mr. Demeny, with the aid of the new chronopho- 
tographic apparatus willingly photographed several tricks of presti- 
digitation. This apparatus, of which a description was given at the 
Academy of Sciences, is capable of taking as many as thirty instan- 
taneous photographs of one movement; each one of these photographs 
is separated from the other by an equal space. The series of the 
experiment gives at the same time the form of tlie phenomenon and 
the length of time it occupies. It is well known that chronophotog- 
raphy has found numerous applications in the domains of jihysical 
and natural sciences. It is to photography we owe the analyzing of 
many complex movements which, on account of their rapidity, escaped 
the analysis of the eye, for instance, the flying of a bird, the difter- 
ent gaits of the horse, the step of man while running or walking, and 
in general, all physical exercises. 



PSYCHOLOGY OF PRESTIDIGITATION. 571 

Two artists, Messrs. Ariioiild and liayiialy, (consented to execute 
before the api)aratns tlieir very best tricks with cards and with juggiiug 
balls. We thus photographed " le saut de coupe d'une main, et de deux 
inaius," "le lilage," "le rayonnement," "la carte a I'cpil," and also the 
vanishing cage, nutmeg, egg, etc. Each of these tricks, which occu- 
pies about a second, often less, was detailed by a dozen photographs. 
The egg trick, which takes exactly a second and a half, can be studied 
in a series of fifteen photographs, each of which is as complete in every 
detail as if the artist had sat for it alone. 

On examining this photographic collection we are surprised at not 
finding the illusion so forcible as when the trick is executed before 
our eyes; in looking over, for example, the numerous pictures which 
indicate the position of the hands in "un saut de coup," we seize the 
mechanism of this complicated operation, but we can not understand 
how the illusion was produced. This series of photographs revealed 
to Mr. Eaynaly, who had executed the trick, a detail which he had not 
perceived before. During " le saut de coupe," which he performs in 
about fifteen hundredths of a second, he places one of his hands in front 
of the cards to screen them from view; but the whole trick is executed 
with such rapidity that the spectator does not perceive this action, 
and, what is still more curious, the artist himself was not aware of it. 
The photographs of the artist juggling an Qgg has also curious results; 
one can follow attentively the successive attitudes of his hands in pre- 
tending to pass the egg from the right to the left. We have not for 
one moment the impression that the exchange has actually been made. 
We are even surprised to see that the pretended movement resembles 
the real movement only at a distance. Not in one of the pictures has the 
hand the natural movement it should have in laying hold of an object; 
the trick is done so rapidly that a gross imitation is sufficient to give 
the illusion. If the photographic proof destroys so completely the 
illusion, it is because it does away with all the adjuncts necessary for the 
illusion which we have enumerated : The rapidity of tlie trick, the little 
discourse given by the artist, the maneuvers which cause a diversion 
or a diminution of attention, etc. Thanks to photography, we can 
make a division between these elements of all perception which are so 
often confounded the one with the other : Brute sensation and the inter- 
pretation of the mind. 



A DISCOVEKY OF GEEEK IIOIMZONTAL rUliVES lif THE 
MAISON CARREE AT ^IMES.' 



By Wm. JJenry Goodyeak. 



Forty-four years have passed away since Francis Craumer Penrose, 
then an architect just beginning' life, pubhshed, with the aid and coopera- 
tiou of the Dilettanti Society of London, his epoch-making work on the 
Principles of Athenian Architecture. It was, therefore, in 1851 that 
the world of science was first advised of a series of facts regarding' the 
construction of the Parthenon and other temples of the Greeks which 
are still a perpetual source of wonder and of speculation to the special- 
ist, to whose knowledge even the existence of these facts is still very 
closely confined. 

The observations and measurements of Penrose were undertaken in 
1815, and were completed in 181G and 1817. XJ]} to those years the^ 
Greek temple was supposed to be what to the superficial observer it 
appears to be. Its horizontal lines were supposed to be level and were 
consequently supposed to be straight; its vertical lines were supposed 
to be perpendicular ; its corresponding" and apparently equal dimensions 
were supposed to be equal, and its corresponding spaces and distances 
were supposed to be commensurate. To discover an exact mathematical 
ratio in its main proportions was the constant effort of the archaeologist. 
The mathematical ratios had not been discovered exactly; but this was 
thought to be the fault ot the modern and not the fault of the Greek. 

On a sudden the measuring ro<l of Penrose revealed that no two 
neighboring capitals or abaci of the l*artlienon are of corresponding 
size, that the diameters of the columns are unecjual, that the inter- 
columnar spacings are irregular, and that the metope spaces are of 
irregular width. His i)lumb line showed that none of the apparently 
vertical lines are really perpendicular. The columns all lean toward 
the center of the building. The side walls also lean to the center. 
The i^ilasters or antit at the angles of the building lean forward. The 
architrave and frieze lean backward and away from the imaginary 
perpendicular. The cornice and the fillet between the frieze and arclii- 
trave, as well as the acroteria and anteflxai, have their faces inclined 
forward of the imaginary i)eri)endicular. Finally, the main horizontal

lines of the building are constructed in curves which rise in vertical 
planes to the center of each side, but these curves do not form parallels. 

Three main facts api)ear throughout all these various i)henomena: 
First, an unquestionable purjjose and intention, whatever the purpose 
and intention may have been; second, an avoidance of all exact ratios 
in iiroportions, of all exact correspondences in the presumably equal 
objects, sizes, and spaces, and of all mathematically straight, mathe- 
matically peri)endicular, and mathematically parallel lines; third, an 
avoidance of all such irregularities as are easily detected, or as are 
obtrusively consx)icuous to the eye. 

As regards the curves, they are inconspicuous to the eye unless 
sighted for from some one angle of the building and along the line of 
the steps, or of the exterior line of the stylobate (the i)latform on which 
the temple rests). As viewed even from such an angle, they are so deli- 
cate as not to be obtrusively consi)icuous. As seen from other points 
of view, especially opposite the center of the ends or sides of the build- 
ing, they may be detected by close observation, but there is no point of 
view from which the eye is not naturally disposed to discount the effect 
as one of perspective. As there are no straight lines, but only delicate 
curves when straight lines are viewed in perspective, it is natural for 
the eye to discount the effect of a delicate curve; for this is what the 
eye constantly does when the actually straight line is curved by nat- 
ural perspective. As regards the appearance of inclination in the col- 
umns, we have the testimony of Mr. Penrose that he was months in 
Athens before he could determine by the eye without plumbing which 
way a given column leans, and this fact will describe the delicacy of 
other deviations from the perpendicular. 

As regards the variations in size of presumably equal objects, or of 
spacing in presumably equal distances, it maybe said that none of them 
can be definitely asserted to exist on purely ocular testimony, and that 
the surveyor's work is necessary not only to determine their amount, 
but even to determine their existence. Here again the difficulty in 
definite ocular detection depends on the fact that all objects of exactly 
corresi)onding size vary in api)arent size according to the ])oint of 
sight. Hence, when an element of delicate irregularity of size or 
spacing is artificially produced it is impossible for the eye to avoid 
discounting this irregularity into perspective effect. Let it be noted 
here that I do not use the words "perspective effect" as necessarily 
implying an increase in effect of magnitude. If a I'arthenon capital 
nearer to the eye be smaller than one next to it, and farther away 
from the eye, the effect in so far would be to diminish apparent distance 
between the two capitals, but this would still be an illusive effect of 
persi)ective appearance, because the ordinary effects of perspective 
woidd prevent the eye from appreciating an exact equality of size if it 
had existed. Then, again, if a spectator be facing two unequal adja- 
cent capitals at exactly equal distances from each, in which case they

would naturally ap[>ear equal, the differeuce of size indicates to the 

eye a deflection in the line of the building, or, in other words, the 

spectator appears, in so far, to be nearer to the large capital than he is 

to the smaller one. 

I. 

We will now specify some of the maximum cases of irregularity 
according to the measurements of Penrose, which are given in feet and 
decimals of a foot. The curve of the Parthenon entablature on the 
flanks, about 228 feet in length, is 0.307 (decimals of a foot). At the 
sides of the building it is 0.171 in something over 100 feet. (The flattest 
curve in Greek art is the entasis of the Ercchtheium columns, which is 
0.0195 in 21 feet.) The Parthenon columns lean 0.22S in 30 feet, an 
inclination of one unit in 150 units. In other words, as the columns 
lean to the center of the building they would, if sufficiently prolonged 
in height, meet at a height of 5,856 feet above the level of the pavement. 
The ant?B have a forward lean of 1 unit in 82, and the acroteria and 
the antefixte have a forward lean of 1 in 25. A maximum devia- 
tion in spacings of the metopes is 0.325; the measurements of these 
spaces being 4 feet and over. The maximum deviation in intercolumnar 
spacings is over 2 feet, but this amount of deviation is only found at 
the angles where the columns next the corner are that much nearer the 
corner. At these points the spacings narrow from 8 feet and a decimal 
to G feet and a decimal. Aside from the angle columns the maximum 
intercolumnar deviation on the north flank is 0.136, in measurements 
which are all over 8 feet with decimal variations. A maximum devia- 
tion in the diameters of columns (of corresponding lines and sizes) is 
0,23 in measurements giving diameters of 5 feet and a decimal. A max- 
imum deviation in size of the capitals is 0.312 in measurements of 6 feet 
and a decimal. 

These instances will give an idea of the amount of actual irregulari- 
ties according to actual measurement, and we will add that instances of 
two adjacent measurements being equal are almost absolutely unknown. 
We can occasionally trace some scheme in the variations by comparing 
two halves of one end, or one side of the building, but when such a 
scheme appears it does not repeat itself in any two different series of 
measurements on one side or one end of the building. For instance, 
in the metopes of the east front the spaces widen from the angles 
toward the center, but this does not hold of the intercolumnar spacings, 
where the only perceptible scheme is that which makes the corner 
intercolumuiations narrower by 2 feet and a fraction. 

That all these remarkable deflections and irregularities were intended 
has been proven by masonry measurements and masonry observations. 
Penrose places the maximum deviation, due to error or carelessness in 
the Parthenon masonry, at one-flftieth of an inch. The two ends of the 
building are of equal width within that fraction. The difference of 0.02 
(incli decimal) in 101 feet points out 'Hhe degree of error which may

have arisen from maccnracy of workraaushii) in the rartheiion." To 
quote his oavu words a^ain: "In the measurement of modern or even 
Roman bnihiings an attempt to obtain the original measurements of con- 
siderable distances to the thousandth i)art of a foot would be fallacious, 
but in a building of the best Greek workmanship it can be done satis- 
factorily if proper care be taken to selec^t such measurements as have 
been least exposed to the action of the weather, for, owing to the j^erfect 
jointing of the stones, the errors occasioned by any small shifts, which 
may have arisen from earthquakes or the violence of human agency, 
can be corrected most satisfactorily." To illustrate the refinement of 
masonry jointing he mentions the observation of Stuart that the stones 
of the steps under the columns of the Parthenon have actually grown 
together. "On breaking off ])arts of two stones at the joint he found 
them as firmly united as though they had never been separate." This 
is explained as due to molecular attraction of two surfaces ground 
together to a very smooth finish, on the principal which explains why 
two panes of glass may adhere to one another. For an account of the 
methods by which this wonderfully fine fitting and jointing were 
obtained, the Avork I am quoting must be consulted. 

II. 

Although the ultimate topic of this ])aper is the discovery of Greek 
horizontal curves in the Maison Carree at iSTimes, which I nmde in 
LSOl, I have considered it necessary not only to include an account 
of the existence of the Greek curves themselves, but also a rather 
exj^licit mention of all the irregularities connected with them; not only 
because incommensurate intercolumnar spacings and leaning faces and 
members are included in my observations at Nimes, but also because 
the existence of the Greek horizontal curves is one of a series of facts 
whose startling significance and importance can not be wholly grasped 
until all of them are made known. This point again reacts on the 
importance of all observations which tend to supplement or accent cer- 
tain explanations of any one set of these phenomena as against some 
certain other explanation. It will i^resently appear that my discovery 
at JSTimes has the result of agitating the still undetermined purpose or 
I>ui'i>oses of the Crreek optical refinements in masonry, and that it tends 
to minimize the importance of the explanations offered by Penrose in 
favor of those which have been offei*ed by certain other students. It 
also, as we shall see, throws a strong side light on the probable Egyp- 
tian origin of the Greek curves, and thereby again tends to throw new 
light on their j)urpose on account of certain peculiar features of the 
Egyptain examples. 

We will, therefore, draw nearer to my ultimate aim by degrees, and 
bj^ considering in the next place the history of the discovery of the 
Greek horizontal curves, whose confirmation and detailed demonstra- 
tion it was the great mission of Penrose to accouq)lish.

Tlie measurement of the liorizontal curves was the greatest achieve- 
ment of Penrose, but their existence was not his discovery, as many 
of the facts were which I liave just enumerated. In all cases it is the 
measurements of Penrose which have established the facts as not being 
accidental and as being in masonry construction; but the observation 
which discovered the curves was made in 1837 by Mr. John Penne- 
thorne, and in the same year and about the same time the curves of the 
Parthenon w^ere noticed by two German arcliitects, Hofer and Schau- 
bert. These gentlemen were the first to publish the discovery in 1838. 
This i^ublication appeared in a Viennese architectural journal, the 
AVeiner Bauzeitung, 

What is the peculiar constitution of the modern eye which had over- 
looked the existence of these curves til! 1837? What is the pecuhar 
constitution of the modern reader who had anxiously been conning his 
A^itruvius since 1500 without considering the passage in which this 
Eomau author directs the construction of these curves? Why is it that 
when AAUkins made his excellent translation of A'itruvius in 1812 he 
added a footnote to the passage on the curves to say that "this great 
refinement suggested by physical knowledge does not appear to have 
entered into the execution of the works of the ancients" ? Why is it 
that AA' ilkins did not do in 1812 what Pennethorne did in 1837 — that is, 
test the author by the buildings? 

Here at least are the facts. It is forty-four years only that the world 
of science has had the proper ■measurements of the Greek temples. 
. Stuart and lievett had measured the whole Parthenon as far back as 
1756. Lord Elgin and his workmen had had their scafiblds on it in the 
early nineteenth century, and yet the curves had not been seen. It was 
not even known until 1810 that the Greek columns had an entasis. 
This was the discovery of Cokerell, but he did not notice that all lines 
of the entire building exhibited a similar refinement. Donaldson dis- 
covered in 1829 the lean of the columns, but it was left for Penrose to 
discover the inward lean of the door jambs and forward lean of the 
antiC and the inclined faces of the entablature. 

Let us, then, emphasize for a moment the discovery of Pennethorne as 
leading to all the later ones, and crowning all the earlier ones, and let 
us relate the way in which he made it. Mr. John Pennethorne, who was 
then a young architect, had first visited Athens in 1832, and he did not 
then make this discovery. In 1833 he made a trip to Egyijt and was 
astounded to find in the Theban tem])le of Medinet Habou a series of 
convex curves m the architraves of the second court. On his return 
from Egypt he visited Athens a second time in 1835, again without 
observing the existence of the curves in Athens. It appears that after 
his second return to England the passage in A^itruvius attracted his 
attention. He says that he saw no reason to doubt the implications of 
the passage in Vitruvius, and thus was lead to make a third visit to 
Athens and reexamine the Parthenon. Thus was the discovery made.

It should no doubt be added that the long sides of the Parthenon have 
lost tlie main central portions of their entablatures by the gunpowder 
explosion of the seventeenth century, and that consequently the curves 
can not be studied here. At the ends of the building, which are shorter, 
it is not so easy to notice the curve of the entablature. The most 
favorable location for the observation is on the long sides of the stylo- 
bate. Here, then, is the place to point out that this platform of the 
temple and also the temple steps had been covered by rubbish down to 
1837, and that observations of the curves on their lines had been previ- 
ously impossible in the Parthenon. But we may also point out that 
the Theseum at Athens has its long sides and upper entablatures intact. 
Here at least the curves might have been noticed before 1837. The 
curves have since been noticed in a number of other ruins which had 
been visited by students and measured before 1837. The laying bare 
of the stylobate of the Parthenon in 1837 assisted the discover}^ of 
Pennethorne, but it does not explain why some other student had not 
previously made the observation for the Theseum and for numerous 
other temples. 

The reader will notice that I am working gradually toward an exjjla- 
nation of the fact that the curves of the Maison Carree, in southern 
France, were not noticed as being in construction until 1891. We have 
a parallel fact for the Athenian temples. Those buildings had been 
studied and carefully measured for a period of over eighty years before 
their curves were noticed. In 1756 were begun the measurements of 
Stuart and Eevett; in 1837 were made the observations of Pennethorne 
and Hofer. 

What, then, is the explanation for the oversight of these phenomena 
in either case? Clearly there are two. The modern eye is dull and 
blunted as compared with the eye of the Greek. People look, but they 
do not see. But, above all, the effect is discounted by the eye. What- 
ever may have been the i)urpose of the Greek curves, there are only two 
possible effects. From certain points of view (it may be from all points 
of view) a perspective enlargement — from other points of view an 
optical mystification, if not a perspective enlargement. 

We will illustrate the direct perspective effect of enlargement by 
assuming a ijoint of view opposite the center of one of the sides or of one 
of the ends of the building. From such a j)oint of view the lines will fall 
in perspective on either side, and as their change of direction is purely an 
optical effect, in which each point of the line changes position according 
to its distance from the eye, it follows that this line must be a curve down- 
ward in each direction away from the center. On this head we can 
have only one opinion from all experts in curvilinear perspective. 

We will illustrate the optical mystification by assuming a standpoint 
opposite one of the angles of the building. I will not assert absolutely 
that there is a perspective increment from this position. It is my opin- 
ion that the already recognized principles of curvilinear perspective

GREEK HORIZONTAL CURVES IN MATSON CARREE AT NIMES. 579 

may involve this positiou, but it would be a position so far not familiar 
to experts, and I prefer not to debate it here. I will, however, most 
positively assert that from the given i^oint of view one of two results 
must follow, either a direct perspective increment, or else an optical 
mystification owing- to the contradictory optical effects of two sets of 
phenomena — one of which effects is artificial, while the other effect is 
natural. 

For our present purpose it makes no difference whether optical 
mystification or perspective increment, or both, are the results of the 
Greek horizontal curves. My present argument is simply to the end 
that in either case the effect is discounted by the eye. The cause is 
therefore not perceived. 

We may therefore assign three causes for the long failure of the 
modern eye to detect the Greek horizontal curves: First, inferior 
sharpness of vision and inattention to art forms. It is admitted that 
Greek art and Greek taste were superior to our own. This amounts to 
admitting that the Greek eye was more acute and more highly trained. 
Second, the effects of the curves, whether they be perspective effects 
or simply mystifications, or both, tend to prevent the detection of the 
underlying facts and causes. Third, the curves are so delicate as not 
to be obtrusive to the eye under any circumstances. 

We are prepared therefore to understand why the curves of the 
Maison Carree have not been noticed sooner. 

I have so far carefully avoided making any reference to the i)urpose 
of the Greek curves. I have only asserted that they have certain 
results, without debating- the question whether these results were 
intended. It will now bring us nearer to our ultimate topic and aim 
if I announce my own observations for horizontal curves in Egyptian 
temples and connect them with those of Mr. Pennethorne, which I 
have mentioned for the Theban temple of Mediuet Habou. 

III. 

It is, then, a fact to be once more noted that the discovery of curves 
in Greek temple construction was preceded by a discovery of curves in 
Egyptian temple construction and that the same person made both 
discoveries. It is also a fact to be noted that the curves of the Greek 
temples (as so far discussed) are curves in elevation, curves in the 
direction of the altitude, while the curves at Mediuet Habou are curves 
in plane, convex to the line of vision. They are curves lying in hori- 
zontal planes as distinct from curves lying in vertical planes. It would 
appear reasonable, considering the growing conviction of scholars that 
Egyptian art and culture had in many important ways infiuenced the 
Greeks, that any theory as to the purpose of the Greek curves should 
be a theory which would also include Egyptian curves in its explana- 
tion, but this has not been the case, strange to say. The reasons for 
this are not only curious but they are also important to our argument. 



580 GREEK HORIZONTAL CURVES IN MAISON CARREE AT NIMES. 

Mr. Peunethonie's discovery of the curves at Athens was not iiniiie- 
diately published by liiin, aside from a ])aiuphh't printed for pii\ate 
distribution, nor was it published by him for many years. His own 
publication was delayed until J878, twenty-seven years after the publi- 
cation of Penrose, and forty-one years after his own diseo\ery. This 
delay appears to have been owing- to lack of eneouragement in his 
special studies and to the abandonment for many years of his chosen 
career. He tells us that he took up the pursuit of a.iiTicuIture soon 
after his return to England. Most curious ot all, he did not know until 
18()0 that the curves which he first discovered had been measured by 
Penrose in 1846. It was not till 1800 that the work of Penrose pub- 
lished in 1851 came to his knowledge. It was not until 1878 that he 
announced the curves at Medmet Hnbou, and meantime all the theories 
so far made known as to the curves of the Parthenon had made their 
appearance and had beeu adv.anced without this important knowledge. 
Not only that; when Mv. Pennethorne did publish, it was in a book on 
The Optics and Geometry of Ancient Architecture, which costs a large 
sum ($35), and which, being a specialist book devoted to Greek archi- 
tecture, has apparently so fiir not come to the notice of one single 
Egyptologist. There is not a single book, guidebook or any book oth- 
erwise known to me, which relates to Egypt which mentions the curves 
at Medinet Habou. I have never met an p]gyptologist who knew of 
their existence, and it appears to have been reserved for me to make 
the first observations and measurements for curves in three courts — at 
Luxor, in the great court atKarnak, and in the court at Edfou. 

Mr. Pennethorne tells us in 1878 that he did not, when in Egypt, give 
the further attention to the subject and attach the importance to it 
which it deserved, but the temple at Edfou where I have observed the 
curves was not cleared out till twenty-seven years after Pennethorne 
was in Egypt. Down to 18(50 this temple was covered by an Egyi)tian 
village. The courts of Luxor were not cleared out till 1891, the year 
when I was in Egypt, and no one could have previously made measure- 
ments there. As for the court of Karnak, it is still buried in rubbish 
and observations can only be made in an imperfect, but I think 
convincing, way on the lines of the architrave. 

It is, however, a most significant thing that the curves at Medinet 
Habou are generally unknown in 18!»5 to the world of science and of 
travel. They amount on the short side of the court to 8 inches deflec- 
tion in the architrave in a length of 80 feet inches, and, on the long- 
side, to 4i inches in a length of 101 feet inches. They can be sighted 
on the roofs of the portico with the greatest ease and are most posi- 
tively wholly constructive and not accidental, as already shown by 
Pennethorne. And yet I am acquainted with at least one very sharp- 
sighted architectural expert who has been in this court without noting 
the curves and I am acquainted with many travelers who have not 
noticed them. Is it not, then, clear that all these persons have dis- 
counted the effect of the curve ? What this effect is for standpoints

nearly opposite tbe center of any one side for that given side is indi- 
cated by one of Mr. Joim \V, McKecknie's drawings lierewith. Tills 
gentleman is an expert and instructor in perspective and the reader may 
be assured that there are no uncertain theories whatever involved in 
this picture, Kemember, we are not debating whetlier the Egyptian 
architect intended this effect. We are not even debating at this moment 
whether the construction is accidental. We are concerned with the 
actual optical eiiect of the given phenomenon. All architectural lines 
which are curved in horizontal planes, convex to the position of the 
spectators, produce the effect of curves in elevation, as showu by the 
diagram. At an angle of 45 degrees, 8 inches curve in plan gives an 
eiiect of 8 inches curve in elevation. Inside the angle of 45 degrees, 
the apparent height increases rapidly and is something enormous on 
near approach, according to the dictum of another expert in perspec- 
tive. In order to relate our text to the diagram we are speaking of 
points of vision opposite or nearly opposite the center of any one side 
of the court. In such a position the natural downward direction of the 
architrave in perspective is exaggerated by two causes — tirst, there is 
the exaggeration in height at the center; second, the receding line of 
the convex curve gives the effect of an extra downward bend to the line, 
as shown by the bird's-eye view. 

There is a similar result from other points of view% possibly compli- 
cated by optical mystifications due to the contradiction between effects 
of natural jterspecture and the effects of artificial arrangement. The 
grand fact remains that a convex curve of 8 inches in 84 feet in the 
architraves at Medinet Habou lias jiassed wholly unnoticed by an enor- 
mous number of modern travelers, and that it is wholly unknown to 
Egyptologists as far as I am aware. I should be able to name several 
such, and the absence of literary mention in books on Egypt, which are 
generally so quick to point to connectious with Greece where they are 
obvious, is something phenomenal. I will not say at present that the 
Egyptian builder intended an optical illusion, but I will definitely say 
that he did produce one. Certainly not one man can gainsay me who 
has been in this court without peiceiving the curves, and among those 
men is the leading iierspective expert of this country. 

IV. 

All these explanations seem to me of value as helping us to under- 
stand why the convex curves in the architraves of the Maison Carree 
at Nimes w-ere not measured or noticed as in construction till the year 
1891, when I had the pleasure of making this discovery. We under- 
stand, for instance, that scholars had studied and measured the Par- 
thenon for all the years between 1756 and 1837 before its curves were 
noticed, and we understand that the existence of curves in plan in 
ancient architecture had been wholly overlooked, as distinct from the 
existence of curves in elevation. 

No doubt an occasional student or observer has noticed these curves

ill the Maison Carree and set tliem down to the score of masonry dis- 
pla(;ement, a fact so common in old buildings tbat the first thought of 
every architect and builder would naturally be that the timbers of the 
roof had thrust out the cornice and that the curve was not in the 
original construction. This is why I took pains to arm myself, when at 
Nimes, with certificates from the ofticial architect of the city and from 
his predecessor in office, the latter being especially familiar with the 
roof and upper masoniy of the Maison Carree, to the effect that these 
curves are in the masonry construction, although these gentlemen had 
not previously observed the fact. 
Herewith are the certificates: 

"The undersigned, Eugene Chambaud, ex- architect of the city of 
Nimes, after examining the curved lines of the Maison Carree with Mr. 
Goodyear, has veritied the existence of these curves as being in the said 
construction, with the proviso that the curve on the east fiank has been 
exaggerated by a thrust of the roof timbers, but also verifying the fact 
that there has also been a curve on this side in the original construction, 
considering that the line of bases in the engaged columns is curved on 
this side as it is on the other, and that there has been no thrust here; 
considering also that the movement (owing to thrust) is far from hav- 
ing been sufficiently great to produce the curve of the cornice. He con- 
siders the theories of Mr, Goodyear regarding the perspective effects of 
the curves as a reasonable one, and remarks that the theory regarding 
the perspective effect of a convex curve is new but possible. He has 
observed with hiin that the variations of intercolumnar spacing on three 
sides of the monument would undoubtedly have a perspective effect, 
according to Mr. Goodyear's ideas. The Joints of the cornice on the 
west side where there is a curve of 114 centimeters, as measured by Mr. 
Goodyear, are intact with one exception, which is not important for the 
question of the curve. "E. Chambaud.

"The measures herewith have been taken with the assistance of Mr. 
Augiere, architect of the city of Kimes. He witnesses to having 
observed the curves with Mr. Goodyear, and he verifies the fact that 
there has been no thrust in the cornice of the west fiank. As professor 
of persjiective he wishes to say that he considers the theory of Mr. 
Goodyear regarding the perspective effect of a convex curve in plan 
new but reasonable. As to the effect of a concave curve in plan it is 
familiar to experts in perspective. "A. Augiere." 

I must add that on one side of the Maison Carree the curve has been 
exaggerated by a subsequent movement of the masonry, and that on 
this account I confined myself in measurements for the cornice to that 
side where the masonry is in thoroughly good condition. For measur- 
ing the cornice curve I employed tin roofers, who scaled the building 
by roj)es and dropped a plumb line to the pavement below. The curves 
of the cornice, wholly due to niasonry construction, are in horizontal 
planes convex to the position of the spectator, and measure about 5 
inches.

I also made measurements on the line of the stylobate which show 
slight corresponding- curves in the line of the temple wall, and of its 
engaged columns along the plinth line. T have no hesitation in saying 
that even on the line of bases of the engaged columns resting on the 
stylobate there are slight convex curves in both temple walls on the long- 
sides. It is also certain that the great increase of the curve above was 
obtained by leaning out the walls and engaged columns at the center. 

It now remains to say what is the importance of this observation on 
the Maison Carree: First, it overthrows the presumption of scholars 
that the Greek curves were unknown to the time of the Eoman Empire, 
whose taste has been so far considered too coarse for this refinement. 
This observation, therefore, carries the history of the Greek curves from 
the time of the fifth century before 
Christ, down to the time of the 
second century after Christ. It 
extends the life of this Greek re- 
finement seven centuries later than 
as previously known. Second, it 
reopens the question as to the pur- 
pose of the Greek curves. The 
explanations which have been x)re- 
viously oifered must be revised or 
supplemented to some extent, be- 
cause the explanations previously 
offered have referred to curves in 
elevation and not to curves in 
111 an. 

This brings us back to the ex- 
planations so far offered for the 
Greek curves. We have seen that 
the German architect Hoffer was 
the first to announce the Parthenon 
curves in publication. This was in 
1838. II offers explanation was that 
the curves of the upper lines were 
intended to accent and exaggerate the effects of curvilinear perspec- 
tive and thus give increased dimensions to the building when seen from 
a point of view facing the center of either side, but he also considered 
them as giving life and beauty to the building, and as superior to the 
more monotonous and colder effects of mathematically straight lines. 
This latter view is the one which has mainly figured in the standard 
compendiums of the Germans; for instance, in those of Kugler, of 
Schnaase, and of Jacob Burckhardt. It has not been abandoned by 
the publication of Thiersch,' whose essay is the only contribution to the 
optical and mathematical questions involved, aside from those of Pen-

rose and Peiinetborne. Thiers<3li, however, in the main accents and 
develops the point of view of Penrose. The views of the hitter as to the 
theory of the cnrves liave naturally been most familiar to English and 
American students, and as his measurements are our only authority for 
the facts, his theories have naturally been generally accepted by his 
English and American readers. The explanation of Penrose moves 
from the accepted fact that there is a tendency to optical downward 
deilection in the straight line of an entablature below the angle of a 
gable or pediment. It is his theory that these lines of the entablature 
were accordingly curved upward in order to counteract this defection. 
As to the curves of the flanks, Penrose regards them as a ccmseqnence 
incident originally on the methods pursued for the entablatures under 
the pediments, and then adds: 

"We may attribute the use of this relinement to the. feeling of a 
greater appearance of strength imparted by it, to the appreciation of 
beauty inherent in a curved line and to the experience of a want of 
harmony between the convex stylobates and architraves of the front 
and the straight lines used in the flanks of the earliest temples. And 
further, if we may suppose the lirst examples of its application on the 
flanks to have occurred in situations like those in which the two 
temples above mentioned (viz: the Parthenon and Olympian Jupiter 
Temple) are built, the presence of a delicate, but not inai)preciable 
curve in what may be considered as Nature's great and only horizon- 
tal line may possibly have combined with other causes to have sug- 
gested its use."^ 

Although Penrose is distinctly of the view that the hardness and 
dryness of modern copies of Greek architecture are due to the absence 
of these refinements, his efltbrt is in each case of the various refinements 
quoted at the opening of this paj)er to look for an oi)tical correction as 
distinct from an optical illusion; and yet for the most important curves 
of all, viz, those of the long sides of the temple, he does not even sug- 
gest that an optical correction was needed. 

We come finally to the views of Boutmy, Philosophie de TArchitec- 
ture en Grece, 1870, who returns to and revives the idea of Hofler of a 
perspective illusion, but still confining his explanation to an effect from 
one point of view, viz, that opposite to the center of the sides or ends 
of a temple. 

Now, the importance of the observation of curves in the Maison 
Carree is that they were not applied to the iiediments at all, but exclu- 
sively to the sides. The theory of an optical correction is therefore 
insuflicient, and the theory of a perspective illusion appears to be the 
only one left us; but this theory has never jireviously been announced 
as an explanation for the construction of curves in plan convex to the 
point of vision. It is, however, clear that all curves in plan convex to 
the line of vision produce an effect of curves in elevation. I am indebted 
to Prof. William E. Ware, of Columbia College, for the information that

at an angle of 45 degrees a curve of 5 inches in plan, when not perceived 
by the eye, will produce an effect of 5 inches curve in elevation. From 
all points of view further removed the effect will be less, but the build- 
ers of the Maison Carree and of the second court of lATedinet Habou 
seem to have purposed to make this good by making the curves corre- 
spondingly heavier to begin with. 

In the Parthenon the curve is under 4 inches in 228 feet. At Medi- 
net Hab(m the heaviest curve is 8 inches in less than 100 feet, and at 
Nimes it is nearly 5 inches in about 100 feet. 

To the above points we must now add the general revision in the atti- 
tude of archaeology to the question of curves in ancient architecture, 
which is probably involved m my observations for curves in plan in the 
courts at Karnak, at Luxor and at Edfou. The conservatism and habits 
of repetition in Egyptian art would under any circumstances make it

highly improbable that the curves in Egyptian architecture were con- 
fined to the one temple of Medinet Habou, but we have seen that, 
owing to the late announcement by Pennethorne (1878) and the general 
oversight by Egyptologists of this announcement, their existence even 
here is still generally unknown to science. A few words, then, as to 
my own observations in Egypt. My trip here was made in the interest 
of other studies and the subject of lotus ornament and its influence on 
Greek patterns. My measurements and observations were consequently 
hurried and imperfect. Still, here are the facts. Although the great 
court at Karnak is so filled with rubbish that one can climb in several 
places to the top of the architraves, I am able to announce, as far as 
these architraves are concerned, that curves convex to the court are 
visible. At Luxor the cohimns of the largest court on two sides have 
leaned forward so far as to threaten downfall and have been shored up

accordingly by beams duriiiii' and since tlie excavations not quite com- 
pleted in 1891. Measurements taken by me in all three courts at Luxor 
show curves in all lines of columns at the bases, all convex to the cen- 
ters of the courts, varying from 1^ to 7 inches. It is clear at Medinet 
Habou that the lower curves in the lines of tlie basis and in the lines 
of columns near the bases were comparatively slight and that the curve 
was obtained in the architrave and cornice (as it was at Nimes) by 
leaning forward the center columns. This would explain the movement 
of the masonry which has required the columns at Luxor to be shored 
up by timbers. 

All earthquakes and other forces tending to disintegrate these build- 
ings, such as pulling down and destroying the accessible parts of the 
temple, would tend to exaggerate the lean of the center columns and 
bring about the threatened downfall now imminent at Luxor. My 
observations at Edfou point the same way. On all four sides of the

court I have measured curves in the line of the bases of \h inches on 
each side of the court. Very heavy curves — of 10 inches in one case — 
appear in the cornice lines, but the cornices have moved forward and 
the original lean of the center columns has been exaggerated by acci- 
dental tipping. The joints of the columns have parted at the rear, and 
it will require careful examination and survey at Edfou to show how 
much of the upper curve is due to movement of the masonry and 
how^ much is due to construction. One main fact remains to be men- 
tioned for Egyptian temples. Although their curves have so far been 
utterly ignored and neglected, excepting by Pennethorne and myself,' 
the existence of other perspective illusions is admitted for Egyptian 
temples by Egyptological experts. 

It is noted by a number of authors that the temples were generally 
built with pavements rising toward the sanctuary and with roofs grad-

iially lowered in the same direction, and that this was done for per- 
spective illusion. Maspero is one of the authorities who mentions this. 
Mentions are also made of this by liawlmson and by Prof. Reginald 
Stuart Poole. 

Y. 

Altbougli tbese various observations point to a perspective purpose 
in the Egyptian and Greek curves, I do not wish to appear to antagonize 
the view that optical refinements were used in Greek architecture to 
correct optical illusions, for I believe that they may liave been so used; 
but I wish to point out that the theories which are confined to correc- 
tion are insufficient to meet all the facts, and that the theories which 
have considered the creation of optical illusions to have been one 
purpose of the refinements are now materially strengthened. 

The existence of a temple at Nimes having- curves on the flanks 
without having them in the entablature of the pediments tends to 
antagonize the view of Penrose that the correction of a downward 
optical deflection below the pediment was the first cause of the intro- 
duction of the curves m Greek architecture. The temple of jS^eptune 
at Paestum is quoted by Penrose, in support of his view, as having 
only curves under the pediments, but strange to say, this temple at 
Paestum has been subsequently announced by Jacob Burckhardt to 
have convex curves on its flanks in horizontal planes.' This observa- 
tion is also quoted by Thiersch. Thus I close my paper by pointing- 
out that we have at Paestum one ancient Greek precedent for the 
curves in plan at Nimes, and that both point to Egyptian influence. 
The city of Nimes was settled by a colony of Alexandrian Greeks from 
JEgypt. It apx^ears therefore probable that the curves in Greece were 
derived from Egypt and had the same purpose, but that the curves in 
the Egyptian courts were generally changed to curves in vertical planes 
by Greek art. This was a more refined expedient for attaining the 
same end, less conspicuous in buildings using colonnades for exterior 
porticoes as distinct from buildings using colonnades for the interiors 
of courts. It is comparatively easy to sight for a bulging- curve on the 
exterior of a buikling, but more difficult to sight for it in the interior 
of a court. I was not able, for instance, to sight for the curve at 
Medinet Habou without going on the loof of the portico, but at Nimes 
I was able instantly to sight for the bulge on the long sides from the 
level of the street. These facts, therefore, coincide with the view that 
the general j^urpose of the curves in Greek art was connected with the 
wish to have them inconspicuous, and that the curves at Nimes repre- 
sent either a direct influence from Egypt or the coarser taste of the 
Roman period. On the other hand, the flank curves of the J^eptune 
temj)le of Paestum, which is a very early Greek building, will represent 
the period of direct Egyptian transmission to Greece.

It is generally conceded that Vitruvins drew his matter from earlier 
Greek authors whose works have perished, and that he <lid not always 
fully comprehend the ideas of his sources. I have omitted any argu- 
ment concerning his direction that the stylobate curves are to prevent 
an effect of "alveolation" (i. e., downward deflection) at the center of 
the stylobate. The only modern author who has attempted to explaiii 
this direction by optical theories is Thiersch. This author gives his 
reasons for supposing that a spectator standing near an angle of the 
stylobate and below the level of its platform might experience an 
optical effect of downward deflection in the lines of the stylobate which 
an upward curve would correct, but masmuch as a bulging curve in 
plan could not correct this effect for the standpoint near the angle, I 
have not considered his theory in tins i)ai)er, and 1 only mention it as 
giving' one more illustration of the new light thrown on the Greek 
refinements by the discovery of curves in horizontal planes. There are 
very valuable remarks m Boutmy's work as to the general unreliability 
of Vitruvins for a comprehension of the Greek curves, and one pnrpose 
of this i>aper is to accent the value of Boutmy's contribution to the 
philosophy of Greek architectuie. I lis work also contains quotations 
from Greek authors on the oi)tics of architecture, showing that inten- 
tional optical illusions and intentional optical corrections were alike 
familiar to them. 

There is one thing more to be said before 1 close. The credit for the 
original suggestion that there is a historic connection between the 
Greek curves and those of Medinet Habou belongs to Mr. Pennethorne, 
as does the credit for both discoveries. The wholly original part of 
this paper as regards historic facts is that whi(;h i)oints to the fact that 
two classic buildings — one early Greek atPaestum and one latelioman 
at Nimes — show convex curves in plan which are identical in character 
with the curves in Egypt. The wholly originsil part of this paper as 
regards observations is that which relates to Nimes, Karnak, Luxor, 
and Edfou. The wholly original part of this paper as regards the 
effect of the Greek horizontal curves is that which shows the optical 
results in actual historic buildings of convex curves in horizontal 
l)lanes. I am willing to leave the question of purpose to the expert 
and to the general reader.

I should forfeit your good o]union of lue if I did not confess to feeling 
embarrassed by tlie position in which, by your favor, I find myself. The 
honor and distinction of tilling a chair which has been occupied by so 
many better men than myself is qualified with every doubt and difiS- 
culty. When I look round this room I see before me not only those 
gllted with greater knowledge than I possess, but who have had greater 
opportunities, and have not had the work which they love continually 
interfered with by manifold cares and duties. You will accept this as 
my apology for the disinterested and elementary remarks which I shall 
impose upon you. 

In selecting a subject on which to address you I have felt it would 
not be profitable or interesting to merely index the progress of archie- 
ology during the last twelve months, nor to condense the county his- 
tory of Shropshire into a necessarily dry and compressed guide to local 
antiquities which you must know better than I can know. I have 
thought it more profitable to devote a. little time to considering some of 
the methods of arclueological research, as they have been enlarged and 
developed in late years, and to condensing some of the more general 
conclusions that have been reached, and more especially to illustrate 
them from my own desultory studies. 

The Archipological Institute has always been a most catholic mother. 
In her ample lap she has welcomed every kind of fruit which the 
cornucopia of research has poured out to illustrate the drama of human 
life. Her aim and object have been, as far as possible, to give a picture 
of the sometimes gay and sometimes gloomy procession which our race 
has formed as it has tramped along the avenues of time from the land 
of mist and cloud to the land of darkness. Every fact, however recorded, 
whether preserved in words or graven in the universal language 
with which the ruins of art are enshrined, has been welcome. It has 
taaght the lesson that history means something more than phdosophy 
teaching by examples: it means painting the pictures of the past, and 
piecing together the broken pieces which have escaped its heavy foot

590 THE METHODS OF ARCH^OLOGICAL RESEARCH. 

into a mosaic, in which we may see how our fathers lived, as well as 
what their aims and ideals were; how far they had progressed in mak- 
ing life tolerable and decorating it with sunshine, as well as unriddling 
the meaning of the terribly tragic chapters in which we read how 
mighty empires, in which greatness and glory were combined, and in 
which prosperity seemed anchored as firmly as one of the brave oaks 
of your own country, were leveled to the ground, their ])eople slaugh- 
tered and destroyed, their palaces and temples reduced to dust, and 
their fertile fields once more occupied by the pelican and the jackal. 
It was once the custom to despise some of these lessons. The antiquary 
was a connoisseur, whose studies were dominated by taste and not by 
knowledge. To admire, to study, and to review the masteri^ieces of 
Greek art; to do the same with the masterpieces of the Italian renais- 
gjince — these were his aims, Phidias and Michael Angelo his ideals. It 
was only when the tide was flowing highest that it was deemed profit- 
able to study it. Hence why the collection and the museums gathered 
in former centuries are so wanting in historic value. They represent 
the phases of taste as applied to the acts of other days, and the various 
measures and standards which this change of taste has created, some- 
times inspired by nature alone, and sometimes by nature bewigged and 
bepowdered. We have advanced from this position. We have learned 
that the ebb as well as the flow of the tide is of supreme interest to us, 
perhaps of even more interest. Hence, while we admiie and rejoice in 
some masterpiece like the Hermes of Praxiteles, we are constrained to 
devote a corresi)onding study to the rude bas-reliefs from the temples 
of Copau, and the ruder and more homely products of the old stone men. 
We can scarcely realize that hardly a generation has gone by when, 
at the British Museum, it was the fashion to admit only classical antiq- 
uities as worthy of collection, and that the priceless treasures dug up 
by Faussett and Rolfe were treated as rubbish, unworthy of a place 
in that sanctuary of the arts, and had to seek a home in a provincial 
museum. Fifty years ago a man who had devoted his time, his jmrse, 
and his knowledge to creating a worthy department of British antiqui- 
ties would not have been rewarded with the Order of the Bath, but 
would have been treated by the students of so-called high art as a bar- 
barian and a phillistiue, tit only to consort with people like you and 
me. We have changed all this, but its mischievous results still remain. 
If we go to the British Museum we shall find the noblest collection of 
Greek art in the world. Taken altogether it is quite unapproachable, 
thanks to the labor, the zeal, and the taste of many good men, and nota- 
bly of the late and the present curators of that department. But when 
we turn to Rome — Rome, the mother of modern Europe; Rome, the 
Britain of old days, the great type of practical good sense in govern- 
ment; the Rome whose roads and bridges, whose colonies and towns, 
whose laws and municipal institutions are only rivaled by our own, and 
which ruled the world for a thousand years and more— where are we to 



THE METHODS OF AECH^OLOGICAL RESEARCH. 591 

look for an adequate picture of the Jife lier citizens led and of the vast 
colonial dependencies she controlled? We have a few busts 5 we have 
a room devoted to the antiquities of Eoman Britain, and then we find 
the mistress of many legions and the mother of us all treated every- 
where as a sort of Cinderella to her more favored sister of Greece, a 
mere outhouse and barn attached to a Greek palace. Our contention 
is that there ought to be in our great museum, if not a special depart- 
ment of Eoman antiquities, at least special room devoted to them worthy 
of the fame of Eome and of its importance in human history. For many 
of us who love art, but also love history, it is quite as important to 
know what were the surroundings of Tiberius and of Marcus Aurelius 
as of Pericles and Alexander the Great. What is true of the earlier 
Eome is much more true of Byzantine Eome, the Eome of the Mosque 
of St. Sophia, the Eome which inspired St. Mark's at Venice and the 
glorious buildings at Eavenna and Si^oletro, which shook hands with 
the East, and by this means wedded fresh ideas to those which were 
becoming stagnant. Because Gibbon entitled his work the Decline 
and Fall of the Eoman Empire, we have acquired an entirely mistaken 
perspective in regard to the part played by Byzantium in the history 
of art. Byzantium lived, thrived, and flourished for a thousand years 
after the Goths had taken Eome. Nor are the code of Justinian, the 
histories of Procopius and Constantine, and the magnificent buildings 
dating- from this time and scattered all over the ^Fgean, signals of 
decay and decrepitude, but the reverse; and yet where are we to look 
for an adequate collection of objects to illustrate Byzantine art, its 
rich barbaric sarcophagi, its enamels, silver plate, etc. 

My object in naming- these things is to point a moral. I am afraid 
the old Adam, if he be not still among- us, has left his shadow behind, 
and there remains much for the great and powerful society to urge and 
to press. Archiieology is the study of history by its monuments, and 
not a branch of aesthetics. Let us by all means guard our taste and 
accumulate the highest and best, but let us also be eclectic and catholic, 
and realize that the highest and best of all xihases of art are of supreme 
value; and, further, that what we mean by history is not only the his- 
tory of kings and armies, of great nobles, and great philosophers and 
of the arts they patronized, but also that of the crowd, by whose con- 
tinuous labor the world has been, and continues to be, subdued, and 
whose homely and prosaic surroundings have a dramatic interest of 
their own. If this be one great lesson which the wider horizon of 
modern archaeological study has taught us, another and an equally 
important one is that of the continuity of art. What Herbert Spencer 
and Darwin have pressed upon the students of natural history, we anti- 
quaries learned long before in regard to art, namely, that there are no 
jerks and jumps in its history, but a continuous flow, and not only a 
continuous flow, but something moi-e. It was formerly the notion that 
when art took an apparently new departure, and became rejuvenated

after a long period of stagiiatioij, it was a spoutaueous movement from 
withiD. We now know that m almost every case tliis rejuvenescence 
Avas due to contact with some new ideas which came in from the outside. 
A new graft into tlie old tree was the real source of better fruit. 

Let us take some examples. When the Mongols, Avho were then 
masters of China, conquered Persia, they imported great numbers of 
Persian workmen, and the result was a complete change in the decora 
tion of Chinese porcelain. The vases made by the Moors at Majorca 
and Valencni were i)robably the immediate daughters of the art fabrics 
of Egyjit. and were certainly the mothers of Italian majolica. The 
blaze of flowers and ribbons which suddenly broke out this j'ear in the 
hats and bonnets of English women, without any apparent motive, can 
be traced to the influence of a famous city on the banks of the Seine, 
where an explanation of the change is forthcoming. The Japanese are 
said to have lost their eye for color and form because their old art has 
changed recently for the worse. They have been, in fact, inoculated 
with European taste, as they have been flooded with European products. 
The story is apparently universal. We see the river come out of its 
mountain fountain and flow down blue and sparkling. Presently we 
find the color of its water change to milky white, and realize an exifla- 
nation when we trace the new color to some aftluent watering another 
soil which has come and joined its waters; and sometimes, as in the 
case of the Rhone after it enters Lake Geneva, the milky and the blue 
streams flow side by side, as the new bonnets and hats of every fantastic 
shape and color are mingled with older and more chaste designs on 
older and more sensible people. The great lesson of all this is continuity. 

Again, to take another illustration from natural history, a lesson of 
these later times in archieology has been that of •' survival." We find 
all kinds of archaic survivals — in our speech, in our fairy stories, in our 
clothes, everywhere, in fact — crystallized bowlders of older strata of 
human life, which have been preserved accidentally in another matrix, 
and to those who are willing to read their lesson, reflecting unmistak- 
able features of another time. When we see the Italian peasant going 
on pilgrimages to different altars of Our Lady to be cured of different 
human ills, are we not reminded of the similar practices in an age 
when Venus and her shrines were scattered over the same country, and 
each shrine had its own Venus, just as each altar has its own "Lady" 
endowed with difl'erent healing powers? How^ curious it is to go to a 
Kermiss in some old Butch town, such as Middleburg, or Delft, to see 
the women with their- curiously shaped lace caps, and to be told that 
it is quite possible to distinguish the lioman Catholic families from the 
the Protestant ones, the distinction in the caps having arisen in the 
fiercer days of the sixteenth century. AVe may then examine the bags 
full of curiously shaped and colored cakes sold in the booths, and see 
the roundabouts and rude swing boats loaded with i)erfectly sane peo- 
l)le, many of them (iO or 70 years old ; and then turn to Tenier's great 



THE METHODS OF ARCHJiOLOGICAL KESEARCH. 593 

pictures at Amsterdam, and see precisely the same cakes and the same 
roiiudabouts fioured there! Are not the wooden houses colored with 
red ocher which dot the Chrisenier the very same as were introduced 
by the Dutch there in the grand old days of the iSTorwegian herring- 
fishing in the seventh century ? Are not the bull fights in Spain direct 
survivals of the exhibitions in the circus, no doubt introduced every- 
where by the Romans, just as Spain was the most essentially Roman 
of all the colonies? 

Have we not our own fossil customs everywhere! The aldermen and 
the common councilors of London when decked in their state robes 
might be living in the Plantagenet times, and the beefeaters in the 
time of Henry VIII. The two ridiculous buttons at the back of our 
coats and the bands we barristers wear are useless relics of once useful 
garments, the one dating from the time when there was necessity for 
butt(»niiig back the Haps of the long coats wlieu'George III was king 
and the other renmins of the long collars of King James's time. Are 
not our judges' wigs directly traceable to the baldness of Louis XIV"? 
These useless things, like the many useless and monstrous and offensive 
adjectives used by cabmen and sometimes by schoolboys, are mere sur- 
vivals of things once usefully put on. The games played by the school 
children in the gutter preserve the ritual of primeval worship and the 
social customs of x^rimeval times. Hence, as I have always urged, it 
becomes important and interesting not only to trace the origin of things, 
but also their final departure. Our dictionary makers are the most 
diligent hunters of the first usage of words. Would it not be wise if 
they were also to record the last use of the obsolete words, the dying- 
flicker of a living light ? The very fact we are referring to has sometimes 
perverted archaeological reasoning. Because the Shetland islanders 
still use stone lamps and cups, it does not follow, as some have urged, 
that a Stone Age in Britain is entirely a mistake. It only means, of 
course, that in remote corners the very old art has lived on, just as in 
the names of the old mountains and rivers the language of the earliest 
inhabitants has frequently been preserved. These touches of poetry 
in our very prosaic lives are as much fossil relics of an old historical 
horizon as the fossils which have been found by the German geologists 
in the far-traveled limestone bowlders which strew their country, and 
belong to an age not directly represented in the solid strata of the dis- 
trict. The lessons we are discussing are notably prominent in the more 
recent works on philology, in which loan words and terms foreign to 
the language have been carefully sifted out, and we have thus been 
enabled to find not only the origin of many arts and customs but the 
stage and culture at which different connected races had arrived at tlie 
time when they separated. This we can do by comparing their common 
names for homely or other objects. The same with folklore, and the 
same witli the rituals of different religions, all of them being among- 
the most conservative institutions. This multiplication of avenues by

which to ai)i)roach the thoughts aud works of tlie old men has no doubt 
made our inquiry more complicated aud ditticuU; but it has at the 
same time uuide the materials almost inexhaustible, and the possibility 
of solving- problems once deemed iusoluble much more hopeful. 

Let us now turn to some of the concrete results which our more 
powerful analysis has enabled us to compass. In tlie first jdace, we 
have learned that it is a mistake to confuse art with race. We can not 
change our race — that is indelibly stamped upon us by nature. But 
art — art of every kind — including language, is not an inheritance from 
luiture, but is as much acqun-ed as are our hats and coats. We learn 
all our arts. Hence, we must be perpetually on our guard against the 
fallacy that because art has taken a new dei)arture, therefore we are in 
the presence of a new race. 

Archieology is a science which can only be profitably studied on 
inductive methods. Of this a very notable proof is the discussion on 
the " Origin of man,*' a subject upon which there was much specu- 
lation twenty-five years ago. It has not the same living interest for 
us now. The fact is we realize that materials are wanting at])resent 
to enable us to carry the study very far in this directioUj and the newly 
fledged hopes of a quarter of a century ago have not fructified. The 
origin of the human race, so far as archaeological research goes, is abso- 
lutely beyond our ken, and those who are determined to reach some 
result in this direction must go to the geologists for their facts aud for 
their arguments. The moral for the arcLieological vista is this : We can 
take up the various specialized aud elaborated civilizations which men 
have produced and trace them up to simpler and less specialized forms. 
We can separate the tangle created by their mutual influence upon each 
other, aud trace the enormous changes due to the gradual introduction 
of new ideas aud new processes, of new weapons and new tools. We 
cau trace the complicated pedigree until we reach an age when all 
men used very similar materials and had very similar arts. The 
cramping influence of having to use these often stubborn materials com- 
pelled a monotony of form aud of ornament Avhich is in itself bewilderiug. 
Eventually we reach a stage where it is most difficult to discriminate 
among races or their cliaracteristics by their art alone. For example, 
the polished stone axes left by the Caribs, those found in some parts 
of Europe aud those found in some parts of eastern Asia, are almost 
indistinguishable. Yet, how widely separated these races are in every 
respect! We may thus be only too easily deceived in supposing that 
we are getting nearer to the solution of the problem of the origin of 
man when our goal is the inevitable one, that with his primitive 
Aveapons in'imitive man in many latitudes was constrained to surround 
himself with very similar surroundings. A corrective to this is very 
speedily reached Avhen we turn to other fields of research, such as 
language and mythology, and physical constitution. We can trace back 
the languages of Egypt, of Babylonia, of India, aud China for a long 



THE METHODS OF ARCH^OLOGICAL RESEARCH. 595 

distance beyond the occurrence of regular annals in tliose countries — 
back, in fact, to the Stone Age in each, and similarly with the mythology, 
and the result is that, instead of apparently roachiug a common origin 
and common elements in them, the gap between them seems to get 
wider as we go further back, until we have to confess that if there was 
a common fountain to the various streams it must have been at a period 
so remote that we have no material at present by which to trace them 
to it. The men who wrote the Book of the Dead, those who wrote the 
Ei)ic of Sargon the First, those who wrote the Vedas, and those who 
wrote the Chinese classics, if they were descended, as we believe, from 
common parents, must have been isolated from each other for a long- 
period in order to become so differentiated at such an early date. 
These are only mere samples. 

If we range further afield we shall find the same lesson meeting us 
everywhere. It is said that among the Indians of !N"orth and South 
America there are ninety languages sj)oken which are unintelligible to 
each other. The same problem meets us in the Caucasus, in Siberia, in 
Indo-China, and elsewhere. The existence of these languages is a per- 
petual warning to us to be careful of dogmatizing. How can we explain 
them except by postulating a long period, during which they have been 
gradually diverging from each other ? We can not measure this period 
by any scale or measure. When we compare Icelandic with I^s^orwegian, 
and remember how long ago it is that Iceland was colonized — when we 
compare the Mongol language, still spoken b}^ the Buriats in Mongolia, 
with the language of the letters of the Mongol Khans written to the 
French kings in the thirteenth century, we shall have a measure of the 
slowness with which these changes sometimes accrue. If it has taken 
sixteen centuries to convert Latin into the various Eoman languages 
bow long has it taken for the diversion of the various Aryan forms of 
speech from one original language, and how much longer to converge 
the Aryan, Semitic, and other families of language upon a common 
mother? The very question is full of romantic difficulty, and assuredly 
we are a long way from any satisfactory answer to it. The evidence of 
language and mythology is supplemented and confirmed l)y that of the 
l)hysical features of our race — features which seem to be so conservative 
and so difficult to alter. If we examine the very earliest human pic- 
tures which have been preserved in the tombs of Egypt we shall find 
representatives of the various races which then bordered the valley of the 
Nile, and we shall find that in the features and x>hysique they areundis- 
tinguishable trom the tribes still occupying the same districts. The 
Kegro, the Nubian, the Coptic Fellaheen, the Semetic inhabitants of 
Palestine and Arabia, are there pictured as we know them now. 

The earliest monuments of Babylonia similarly discriminate clearly 
the various types of men in Mesopotamia. It is so, also, with the 
early monuments of China, of India, of Mexico, and Peru, and of the 
borders of the Mediterranean, and this evidence of the monuments is

sui:)ported by tlie shapes and contours of tlie skulls vrLicli Lave been 
found in the earliest graves, and which show not merely sporadic vari- 
ation, but variation atfecting" great classes. All this assuredlj^ requires 
us to postulate a long period during which fresh changes were incubat- 
ing and were being carried forward. We have no menus of knowing 
how long this was, We can only very naturally con(;lude that since so 
little change has taken place during the last four thousand years in 
the languages, the customs, and i)hysical features of so many di (Cerent 
races, we must go back a long way if we are to explain the dift'ereiices 
as they exist. 

We have no chronology of any kind for these misty regions. Dates 
entirely fail us. In Egyj)t and in IJabylonia anything like positive 
chronological data fail about 2500 B. C, while, as you know, the Bible 
dates are, before a certain period, not only based upon those of Baby- 
lonia, but they have been preserved in an entirely different shape in 
the Masoretic, the Samaritan, and the Septuagint versions, and there 
is no means of rectifying them. All we can say is that the Masoretic 
numbers, upon which Archbishop Ussher's chronology was based, and 
which was the basis of the calculation in the margins of our Bibles, 
are the least trustworthy of all, and can be shown to be sophisticated 
and altered. If I may be pardoned for referring to a Avork of my own 
in this behalf, namely, that which I have entitled The ]Mammoth and 
the Flood, 1 claim to have shown that all the evidences we possess — 
geological, x>aleontological, and archjieological — converges with singu- 
lar force upon one conclusion, namely, that at the verge of human 
history there was a great and widespread catastroplie, which over- 
whelmed a large part of the temperate regions of the earth and which 
caused great destruction of men and animals. This widespread 
catastrophe has left its mark upon the traditions of many and widely 
scattered peoples. It possibly accounts for the isolation of many races 
in our own day, notably in districts without great natural frontiers, 
which isolation is due, in all i)robability, to the destruction of all inter- 
vening links between the various human colonies which survived. It 
is a remarkable proof of this catastrophe that whereas man is the 
most elastic of creatures in his capacity for facing and overcoming 
difficulties, there is, nevertheless, an absolute gap in his history in 
large areas in Europe unbridged by any remains or by any evidence. 
How are we to explain this'? Once man has occupied the ground he is 
not likely to abandon it entirely and suddenly. Wherever we lind 
one set of men driving out and superseding another, we have evidence 
of gi'adual change (of overlapping). In the hill forts of Dorset we 
liave Boman remains mixed with those of Britons. In the Kentish 
cemeteries we have Boman remains mixed with Saxon. In the case 
before us, however, it is not only human art which shows a gap, but a 
whole fauna snddenlychanges. Not a single mammoth or a rhinoceros 
has ever occurred with the remains of a domesticated animal. Since 



THE METHODS OP ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH. 597 

there are no traces of a transition, it is clear one set of men and ani- 
mals did not absorb the other. To myself this sudden hiatus and gap 
means the occurrence of some sudden and widespread catastrophe 
which desolated a wide area, and destroyed its living- creatures iu 
great numbers, and the recolonization of tlie wasted area by migration 
from elsewhere. To this great catastrophe the traditions of mankind 
go back, as do the geological reference we can collect. It forms the 
great divide in early human history. 

We must not, however, be misled. Some wild writers have argued 
as if human beings were quite different in kind before and after the 
divide. I see no evidence whatever of this. The human skulls found 
with the remains of extinct animals by Lund in the caverns of Brazil 
have all the characters of Indian skulls, while those found with the 
extinct animals in Europe have the characters of European skulls, thus 
showing that at this i)eriod the native races of America and of Europe 
had already been differentiated, and it is extremely probable that the 
so-called paleolithic, or as I prefer to call them, the antediluvial men 
of Europe did not belong to one race, but to several races. Those who 
find certain resemblances to simian skulls in those of antediluvial man 
overlook the x)ower of drawing shown in the etchings of animals on 
pieces of bone found in the French caves, which is quite unmatched in 
after times until we reach a much later ])eriod, while the harpoons, the 
needles, etc., are most skillfully fashioned. Whether the simian origin 
of man be a factor or not, it is clear we have no evidence in archaeology 
as yet to bridge the gap. If we want a key to the Avhole position we 
must turn our backs upon civilized man and explore the fertile fields 
of ethnography and the multiform types which we find among savage 
and semisavage races. Many of these have survived from the time 
before the great catastrophe, which did not in fact affect the Tropics. 
In these latitudes we can find abundant material to study, showing 
how man with very rude tools fashioned for himself very respectable 
surroundings. These various tribes of savages are generally ignored 
when we study history and archtBology. Xo greater mistake could be 
made. Assuredly they present us with survivals on a great scale by 
which we cau measure and test the phases of human i)rogress in its 
earlier stages, and some time, perhaps, we may be able to get them all 
into one pedigree, and to show how a real continuity combines them 
all. Two lessons of great moment mc may learn from them. One is 
that all these varieties of language, of ornament, of dress must have 
taken a very long time to develop; and, secondly, w^hen we come into 
actual contact with them we are struck by the further fact that they 
are desperately conservative. The so-called mug money which marks 
one of the very early chapters of our archaeological history still survives 
in northeastern Africa. The ornaments and the customs of ancient 
Egypt may be still found living in western Soudan and among the 
tribes of Ashanti, while, if we turn to Australia and Tasmania, we 



598 THE METHODS OF ARCH^OLOGICAL RESEAKOH. 

shall fiiiil luiiiiaii arts still in their very iniaiicy, and so far as we laiow 
and can Jndi^o, the arts of these races have remained unchanged and 
unaltered since those primitive times, Avhen the Australians first intro- 
duced the dog into Australia, which means, when the Australian 
animals were still living, while we shall iind among the very backward 
Bushmen and Eskimos a power of drawing animals, etc., comparable 
with that of the cave men, and languages remarkable for their strncture 
and capacity. 

A third lesson which we learn is that it is (pute possible, and in fact 
an everyday occurrence, for two civilizations which liave reached very 
different stages to coexist alongside of each other contemporaneously 
in the same area. Tlie Australian and the Englishman live alongside 
of each other, as the Lapp and the Norwegian; nay, to come nearer 
home, as the gypsy and the sedentary Oxford professor; and we are 
led from this fact to the induction which has been too often forgotten 
or overlooked, that the same thing nuist always have been. We talk 
of a Stone age, of a Bronze age, and of an Iron age, and these are 
excellent terms when we ai^ply them to some particular area like Scan- 
dinavia, to which they were iirst applied; but they are nusleading 
when universally applied. Many savages are still living, or were quite 
recently, in the Stone age, the Shell age, or the Wooden age, like the 
Australians, the Marquesan Islanders, and the Indians of the Amazons, 
while alongside of them were living tlie emigrants from Europe, who 
were not only living in the Iron age, but had learned to harness steam 
to iron, and to nuiltiply human labor tenfold. Not only so, but it is obvi- 
ous in such cases that there may be a great junq) in civilization from a 
very low to a very high step on the ladder without the necessity, or the 
possibility even, of intermediate steps. A Bronze age or a Copper age is 
not at all unlikely to intervene between the hewers of rude stones or of 
polished stones in the Pacitic and in many parts of America and their 
adoption of iron; and, in fact, it may be said that the stage we some- 
times associate with Baleolithic man (very wrongly, as I think), namely, 
that in which the Tasinanians and Australians lately lived, may be 
immediately followed by an Iron age. I say wrongly, because we can 
not argue that the men who lived in our prehistoric caves and were 
contemporaries of the mammoth, whose portrait they scratched on 
ivory, Avere the same race as the low type of men discovered in Tasma- 
nia. Diogenes was a philosopher, and not a dog, as he called himself, 
although he lived in something very like a kennel, and the men who 
invented and elaborated the Vedanta philosophj^, although living with 
the simplest surroundings, are not to be measured with the untutored 
and unreclaimed wild hunters of the Kurdish Mountains, among whom 
the arts of life are at least as much advanced. 

Let us now apply this lesson a little more concretely to the compli- 
cated story of human progress. If we take our archaeological telescope 
and look back through the avenues of time, we shall reach a period 



THE METHODS OF ARCH^OLOGICAL RESEARCH. 599 

when the great civilizatious of the world were still incubating, and 
when in Europe, in north Africa, and in Asia the many scattered 
tribes were living very much as we can see tribes living now in savage 
countries, some by hunting, some by fishing, and some, no doubt, 
leading a pastoral life. This stage in Eurojie and its borders is marked 
archffiologically by what we call the paleolithic or antediluvian man. 
Some have compared him with the Eskimo, because the Eskimo, 
like him, lias artistic instincts and can draw well, and because his sur- 
roundings are supposed to have been of an Arctic character. All this 
is very doubtful and, in fact, misleading. So far as we know, the cave 
man of Europe was com])letely exterminated, as his companions, the 
mammoth and the hairy rhinoceros, were, and has left no descendants. 
His remains as found in the caves are cased with stalagmite, which 
effectually separates them from their successors. The immigrants who 
succeeded them are recognized by their long, narrow skulls, by their 
employing domesticated animals and cultivated plants, and by their 
burying their dead in long barrows. Whence they came we can not 
positively say, but we may reasonably conjecture it was from some 
country where the animals and plants just named were indigenous in 
the wild state. In their graves in Britain no metal objects have been 
found, no tangled or barbed arrowheads, while the pottery is of the 
rudest character, marked by cylindrical shapes. 

In one respect these long mounds present us with a puzzle. We can 
hardly doubt that among barbarous races few things are more likely 
to have been closely studied and more important than the ritual of 
burial, and yet we find the practices of burial and of cremation both 
in vogue. It has been thought that the two practices were, in fact, 
contemporary from the commencement. In this I can not agree. In 
the south of England burial was almost universal among the long bar- 
row men. In Scotland, on the contrary, cremation; but Mr. Anderson 
has shown that even there burial seems to have preceded burning, and 
it seems to me that burning the dead bodies was distinctly an innova- 
tion introduced by the men who had succeeded those with the long 
heads, and that originally it was unknown among these men. Again, 
there is another curious distinction, which is apparently a superficial 
one. When stone was not'to be had the bodies were laid in the ground 
in a more or less crouching attitude and covered in. Otherwise, cham- 
bers were built up of bowlders or other rough stones, which were 
approached by long galleries open to tbe outside, apparently simulating 
underground dwellings, in whicli whole families or clans were buried. 
These again were supplanted when the new men with round heads 
came in by stone boxes or cists closed all round, the introduction of 
which was, in general, coincident with that of burning, although there 
was undoubtedly some overlapping. Who, then, were these long-headed 
men? The early long-headed race of Britain hns, according to fair evi- 
dence, left its trace in Europe in the long-headed, dark-skinned, black-

haired Basques, and in ]5ritain itself tbey seem to have survived in the 
Silurians of Glamorganshire (described by the Eoman T^'riters) and in 
the small black haired people of south Wales and parts of Ireland. 
Traces of the Basque language have been said to be found in the Celtic 
languages, but this particular branch of the field has been hitherto 
very little explored, nor have the local place names in those districts 
where the race may be supposed to have survived. Here, then, we 
seem to have a clue which points to the men with the long heads having 
come from tbe southwest. The Basques have their nearest relations in 
north Africa, where a race wliich buried and did not l)nrn its dead once 
occupied the country, whose remains are still to be found among the 
Berbers and the Kabyles of the Atlas range and among the Guanches 
of the Canary Islands. And these races of the Atlas take us on again 
to the valley of the IStile, where the early Egyptians are now ] ecognized 
to have had close relations of blood, etc., with them, and who were, as 
you know, almost fanatically devoted to the practice of burial, as con- 
trasted with burning in disposing of their dead. In this behalf it is 
curious to remember the distribution of the so-called cromlechs, which 
are merely chambei'ed tombs of another form. They are found all round 
the northern part of Africa, in Spain, in the maritime parts of Gaul, and 
all over Britain, where they have not been displaced by the ]i)low and 
harrow. They abound in Holland and occur again in Scandinavia, 
specimens of their primitive stock having migrate<l from west to east 
iu Europe along the seaboard. This line of migration leads us to the 
Nile Yalley as a goal, and it seems to some of us that the earliest 
inhabitants of that valley were first cousins of our long barrow men. 
There, under favorable conditions of a pure climate and access to the 
necessary tools and weapons of culture, there developed a race which, 
although unacquainted with metals, produced a wonderful culture — 
that of the Egyptians of the old empire. 

We have as yet found no traces of a beginning of this culture on the 
spot, and until quite recently, when Professor Petrie has made some 
remarkal)le discoveries at Coptos, which may throw some light on this 
issue, we seem to have in the monuments of the fourth and fifth djniasty 
every kind of excellence we associate with Egyptian art fully devel- 
oped, including its hierogly])hical writing, its strange mythology, etc., 
and all the while Egypt Avas still in what the Scandinavian antiquaries 
describe as the Stone age. 

Whether tliis art was imported with the race which developed it in 
the jSIile Yalley, or was entirely indigenous, we do not know. It may 
be that it was the discovery of the ancestors of the tribes who are now 
represented by the Bishirins, Hadandowahs, and other wild tribes of 
the eastern Soudan, orl)y the Berbers of the Atlas range, who border 
the Nile Valley on either hand, and nuist have done so for a very long- 
period. One thing seems clear, that for a very considerable period the 
art of the Nile Valley was isolated, and does not seem to have affected 



THE METHODS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH. 601 

that of its neighbors. To us this art is supremely interesting, because 
we can trace its progress stej) by step tbrougii mauifbld vicissitudes 
for four thousand years. 

Let us now return again to our own country. The long-headed 
people here were displaced very largely by a race with round heads, 
who burned their dead and i)ut tlieir ashes in beautifnlly constructed 
urns, and then deposited them in stone cists or boxes in round or 
saucer-shaped mounds and not in long barrows. As we have said, 
there was considerable overlapping between them and their predeces- 
sors, who adopted in some cases their customs, inckiding that of bury- 
ing in round mounds or barrows. The shape of the skulls of these new 
men shows us what a profound racial difference there must have been 
between them and their predecessors. They apparently came from 
another direction, and with different surroundings. So far as we 
know, they were the first wave of that migration of tribes from the 
east which have successively followed each other in Enrt^pe, and are 
represented by the earlier Celts in central and southern France, and 
large parts of Spain, and by the Irish and Scottish Gaels, just as 
their art remains proved the round-headed folk to have mingled with 
their lu'edecessors, the Basques. If we follow our maps eastward, and 
track the steps of those races who burned their dead, we shall find them 
linked step by step — if iiot by race by a certain relationship in tlieir 
arts — to the early dwellers in Mesopotamia. Tliere a similar develop- 
ment to that we all know so well in the Nile Valley, and likewise in 
the Stone age of culture, took place in the valleys of the Eu])hrates 
and the Tigris. Here, however, we seem to have evidence that the 
culture was not homegrown, but there are reasons for believing that 
the men ■ who founded the earliest known communications with 
Chaldea brought with them the arts by which we know them from tlie 
Elamitish Mountains to the east, whence they seem to have sent colo- 
nies westward into Mesopotamia and eastward into China. This 
curious and most interesting induction is one of the most important 
discoveries of recent years. It enables us to link the culture of the 
furthest east to that of the west, and it also enables us to conclude 
that the arts are not the iieculiar heritage of any one race, for here we 
seem to be compelled to admit that the foundation of that culture 
which we call Aryan or Indo-European is really to be traced to the 
now despised Turks and Finnish races. It was a race very nearly akin 
to the Turks and Finns which certainly invented the cuneiform writ- 
ing, and apparently developed the earliest religious system in Chaldea. 
From this race it was directly learned by the Semitic races, whose origi- 
nal home was Arabia, and whose enterprise and vigor distributed them 
far and wide. One thing we must remember, that so far as our present 
evidence goes, the arts of Babylonia were as different from those of the 
Nile Valley as were the language, mythology, and the appearance of 
the people. 



602 THE METHODS OF ARCH^OLOGICAL RESEARCH. 

These Semitic i)eoj)les founded the successive kingdoms of Babylo- 
nia and Assyria, but it was tlie Plioenicians who were chiefly instru- 
mental in multiplying and distributing the wares which the older men 
of Mesopotamia had made. They were to be found trading and traffick- 
ing everywhere from far-off Britain to far-off Thule, and still farther 
to that land of mist and snow where the griffons were supposed to 
guard the gold deposits of Siberia. Their settlements and trading- 
ports were to be found all over the Mediterranean. These same Phoe- 
nicians were also great metallurgists, and if not the discoverers of 
bronze, M^hich added so much to the resources of the early craftsman, 
they were so far as we know the great distaibutors of the knowledge of 
the making and also of the materials of bronze. 

Let us revert once more to northern Europe, and notably to our own 
country. It was during its occupation by round-headed i)eople that 
the use of bronze was first introduced here. Gold was apparently their 
own discovery, but bronze, I believe, was an imported art, and had 
nothing to do with the introduction of a new race. The bronze workers, 
as we know from the numerous hoards Avhich have occurred, and also 
from the numerous molds which have been found, were traveling 
tinkers and metallurgists, such as the metal workers of Finland still are, 
and as the mediaval goldsmiths in Scotland were. The weapons, orna- 
ments, and tools are of the same type, differing in slight details only 
from one end of Europe to the other, and showing that the art was 
spread over a wide area occupied by many races, and it seems to have 
spread from the Mediterranean lands, i)erhaps by the agency of those 
traders who took Baltic amber to Greece and Italy, and who in the 
first instance were probably the Pha^nicians. It is curious that this 
bronze culture should have advanced to very different stages of style 
and elaboration in different areas. In Spain it advanced only to a small 
degree, as wo may learn from the explorations of my friends, the broth- 
ers Siret; in England and France considerably farther; in Scandi- 
navia and Hungary farther still, and I would suggest as an explanation 
that the reason is that in Spain and the western countries bronze was 
displaced by iron at an earlier date. Thus, while in Scandinavia we 
have no reason to suppose that iron was used until about the Christian 
era, in Britain it must have been used several centuries earlier. Thus 
the later and more developed bronze culture of Denmark and Hungary 
corresponded in age and was synchronous with the earlier use of iron 
in Britain, and probably also in Gaul and Spain, and hence it represents 
a later and more developed art. As I have said, the introduction of 
bronze was the introduction of a- new art, and not a new race, and it is 
a great mistake for x^eople to talk of the bronze folk as if they were 
something ditterent to the men who used stone. 

The next art revolution in these latitxidcs did, however, mean the 
importation of a new stock. This was coincident with the introduction 



THE METHODS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH. 603 

of iron. This problem as it presents itself in Britain, is one of tlie 
great puzzles of early arclueology, for it means a great deal more than 
the mere introduction of iron for the cutting of weapons and tools; it 
means the introduction of au entirely new style of ornament, a style 
of ornament apparently quite indigenous, consisting of the most grace- 
ful scrolls, known as trumpet scrolls, of endless variety and taste. 
Alongside of this we lu.ve the most wonderful skill in inetallurgy. 
Nothing can exceed the delicate manipulation with which the old 
artificers fashioned the objects of manifold shape, and of entirely new 
designs — bone trappings, shields, helmets, swords and dagger sheaths, 
spoons, mirrors, etc., and the dexterous way in which they ornamented 
them with enamel, which they were, apparently, the first to discover 
and to apply. These objects have occurred in the gretest number in 
Great Britain, and in Ireland; but they have also been found in Bel- 
gium, in eastern France, and in certain parts of Switzerland, such as 
La Teue, etc., and it would seem, therefore, that they reached us by 
some migration down the Bliine. One important fact about this art 
is, that we know its relative date. We know that it was living when 
the Komans conquered Britain. The remains of the early Boman con- 
(pierors are found mixed with objects of this date in the hill forts of 
Dorsetshire, etc., and the descriptions of Cfesar apply to this chariot- 
eering people. Not only so, but it survived the Koman Gonqnest in 
that part of these islands untouched by the Eoman Conquest — namely, 
in Ireland. The art of Ireland, until it was displaced and sophisti- 
cated by the Norsemen, was a mere development and growth of this 
art, and it is found abundantly displayed in the ornaments illustrated 
by Westwood in his work on Irish MSS. How long it has flourished 
here before the Eoman Conquest, and at what date it displaced the art 
of the Bronze people we do not know. As I have said, this same art is 
found in the Ehine Valley, and in Switzerland; it is not found in Den- 
mark and Germany, where the objects of the Iron age have an entirely 
different history. Nor, again, is it found in western France, nor in 
Spain, and the only avenue, therefore, by which it can have reached 
Britain is that suggested by my very acute friend, Mr. Arthur Evans, 
namely, the valley of the Ehine. In his original and suggestive mem- 
oir on this subject, he traces this art to Switzerland. There it seems 
to have incubated and developed itself in contact with the art of the 
Etruscans, with which at some points it has some analogy; but as a 
whole its inspiration is not Etruscan, but it goes back further to that 
primitive Mediterranean art which, for lack of a better name, we call 
Mykenean — the art of the Homeric poems. It is in the Mykenean 
objects that Ave find the same scrolls and the same dexterous manipula- 
tion of metal, and the use also of enamel. The distinction, of course, is 
that the use of iron has meanwhile been introduced. This, however, 
was only for cutting objects j the ornaments, the sword sheaths, the 



604 THE METHODS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH. 

sliieltls, lielmets, mirrors, etc., all continued to be made of bronze. The 
iutroduction of iron merely displaced the kind of metal, and did not 
affect the art. 

To revert for a sentence or two, the people who developed and used 
this later Celtic art also used coins. These coins have been traced 
partially to the coinage of Philip of Macedon, large quantities of whose 
gold staters were probably taken back by the Gauls after their inva- 
sion of Greece. Tlie gradual sophistication of these Greek models has 
been traced and followed out by Sir John Evans with his usnal inge- 
nuity and acumen. On another side we seem to have evidence that 
Druidism, which differed from the old polytheistic religion of the Gauls 
and Germans, which was related to the religions of Rome and Greece, 
was imported from the far East, and, having ap])arently reached 
Thrace, was carried back with them by the Gauls who had invaded 
Greece, and who thus ac(iuired the notions of metempsychosis, etc., 
and I am not at all sure that the old notion of Godfrey Higgins, which 
has not had many adherents lately, is not true that Druidism was 
largely the outcome of the teaching of the Buddhist monks, who, we 
know, penetrated into Persia and Syria, as they spread their ideas and 
the artistic instincts of India all the farther east from Japan to Java. 
But to return to Europe. The art I have been describing, which has 
been styled Keo Celtic by Sir A. Wollaston Franks, who has done so 
much to illustrate it, was imported by a new wave of population, to 
which the name Belgic has been given, and whose original home was 
apparently in Switzerland and South Germany. This race is now best 
represented by the Welsh, but we must not forget that it also had 
large colonies in Ireland, where Neo-Celtic art became predominant 
and where it outlived the Roman domination elsewhere. In Great 
Britain, as oJi the Continent, this art was displaced, as so nuich of the 
art of the w^orld was, by the Romans, itself a daughter of Greece. It 
is not my purpose to discuss such a well-known subject as Roman art. 
I would only i)oint out to you how the newer school of archie()h)gy 
has shown that Roman art was very largely the art of the Roman 
provinces, and not so much Italian. Alexandria was a great center of 
the silversmiths' and other artistic metal ^ork; Treves and Cologne 
and Lyons and Clermont of pottery, of glass, and also of metal work; 
and there can be no doubt that Greece, both continental and insular, 
continued to be under the Roman domination a fertile mother of 
sculpture, arcdiitecture, (?tc. 

Rome was the great assimilator and distributor of these various pro- 
vincial wares, as her language became the lingua franca of half the 
known world; her laws embodied and displaced other forms of juris- 
prudence; her generous Pantheon welcomed the foreign gods, and her 
military system mixed and mingled the natives of very different coun- 
tries and climates. I would like to say, by the way, how necessary it is 
that we should have a complete survey of Roman Britain such as has 



THE METHODS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH, 605 

been so well begun at Silchester, and how much some of us long to see 
the spade i^ut into your own Uriconiuu], When the Roman capital was 
removed to Byzantium new and fresh ideas were apparently developed, or 
perhaps old ones which had been localized there were distributed in all 
directions. In one direction Parthians and Sassanians drank at the 
well, and it is not possible now to say whether the embroideries, the 
damasks, the silver bowls, etc., which we associate with these Eastern 
l)eople were Byzantine or not. In another direction the art of Byzan- 
tium spread all over the Teutonic world. The art we call Teutonic is 
really Byzantine. The tribes which were planted on the various fron- 
tiers of the Empire and were largely in its service and its pay were all 
directly indebted to Byzantium for their art. Hence, why we hnd tlie 
same art with slight local differences among the Goths of the Crimea, 
the Lombards in Italy, the Burgundians in Austria and Switzerland, 
the Alemanni on the Rhine, the jMerovingians in Gaul, the Angles and 
Saxons in Britain, the Visigoths in Spain, the Yandals in Africa, and 
the earlier Scandinavians in Denmark and Scandinavia. The cloissonee 
jewelry, the interlaced dragon patterns, etc., all of which have such a 
common likeness, have an equally common likeness with the work 
which we can trace to the Queen of the Bosphorus; and as Lindin- 
schmidt was never tired of preaching, there is no Teutonic art. The 
art of all the Teutonic tribes who founded the modern States of Europe 
was in reality the art of Byzantium, and this was so in later times also. 
The art of the Carloviugian Empire and of the later Anglo-Saxons 
was the art of the exarchate of Kavenna, just as the art of southeastern 
Europe, as preserved in the churches of Kief, was the direct daughter 
of Constantinople. The enamels, the bronze work, the ivories, the 
illuminations in books, the jewelry, etc., are all directly traceable to 
the same opulent mother. 

But it was among the Arabs that the seeds of Byzantine art flour- 
ished and thrived the most. The Arabs themselves in regard to art 
were always a sterile race. Like their own sands, they do not seem to 
have had the instinct for art; but they had the instinct of government, 
and at Bagdad, at Cairo, and at Granada they founded communities 
which are as famous as any in the world's history. They had the Semitic 
instinct, too, for making money, and, having made it, for spending it 
freely as munificent patrons; but they initiated nothing. When Ave 
speak of Arab art we mean the art of Byzantium, which had a curious 
renaissance of its own under the impulse of fresh ideas gathered together 
from every wind of heaven by the enterprise of these Arab traders, 
who crossed all the known seas from China to the Straits of Gibraltar. 
Cicsarea, Antioch, Damascus, and Alexandria, the mother of Cairo, were 
Byzantine cities with flourishing arts before the Arabs annexed them, 
and, so far as we know, the arts of Damascus and Cairo were the daugh- 
ters of Byzantine art. The» mosques of St. Sophia and of Omar were 
Christian churches before they became the models for the stately build- 



606 THE METHODS OF ARCH^OLOGICAL RESEARCH. 

iiigs of the later caliphs. Embroidery, j)ottery, and glass and metal 
working, including- damascenert and bronze casting, all passed from 
Byzantine craftsmen to those of Arabia, and the chief development they 
received was in response to the injunctions of the Prophet ag'ainst the 
making of graven images and of painted representations, which com- 
pelled those employed by the Arabs to devote their energies to devel- 
oi)ing conventional ornamentation and so-called arabesque work. Their 
contact with the Chinese and the Hindoos enabled them in pottery, and 
probably also in bronze work, etc., to supplement the lessons they learned 
nearer home with fresh lessons from the farthest East. Then came a 
curious phase. As is often the case in the modest life of our homes, the 
daughter, having outgrown her mother's teaching, returned some of the 
lessons, and in turn became the fruitful mother of new ideas and of new 
inspiration. From Egypt and from Syria art workmen found their way 
to Venice and Pisa and other Italian towns, and started men along new 
roads by presenting them with new models. The glass, the brass work, 
and the pottery of Venice, when Venice headed the renaissance of the 
industrial arts, were all the (;hildreu of eastern workmen imported by 
the rich llepublic. Another wave of INTohammedan art influence passed 
through north Africa into southern Spain and its islands. There the 
lustered wares known as majolican had, if not their origin, their great 
development, and thence they were transplanted to Italy. The hue 
tiles which the Moors made were widely imitated, as their azulejos by 
the Spaniards; and thence also largely came the astrolabes, the clocks, 
and other inventions which Arab science had produced. 

One feature in the x)anorama we have hastily traced is obvious, 
namely, that it has been the nations and the x^eoples with great mer- 
cantile enterprise who have not only been rich enough to patronize but 
who have also been in contact with fresh ideas whicli have given art 
its new departure. The Flemings at Bruges and the Hanse traders all 
over the Baltic accumulated and developed ideas which they i)icked up 
at Novgorod and in the far-oft" districts of Perm, etc. On the other 
hand, the Venetians and the Genoese had their factories all over the 
Black Sea and among the isles of Greece. They shook hands there 
with the caravan traders from China and from the far countries of 
Siberia, and had to supply each other in return with objects suitable 
to their taste and needs. The Mongols were masters of the greater 
parts of the Asiatic world. Their ruthless conquests drove the artif- 
icers of Persia into India and into Egypt, and in either country a 
great rejuvenescence of the arts took i)lace at the same time in the 
same style, and it is a most curious piece of history, as well as interest- 
ing in art, to compare the tombs of the caliph at Cairo with those of 
the Pathan sultans at Delhi. Then the Mongols themselves became 
civilized and settled, and their artificers crowded back and brought 
new ideas with them, and atTebriz and Sullania erected buildings and 
decorated them in a manner previously unattained. Not only so, but 



THE METHODS OF ARCH^OLOGICAL RESEARCH. 607 

the great masses of woikineu were transported eastward and westward 
under the control of the same exacting masters, and thus the designs 
on Chinese porcelain — phanixes and dragons, etc. — invaded Persia, 
and similarly the Chinese learned how to make Avhat we call blue and 
white porcelain, which they did not know until the time of the Ming 
dynasty. 

To take one more illustration: We can not wander about the 
glorious ruins of your county — such ruins as Wenlock Priory — without 
being reminded of the sermon in every stone. We realize how much 
we owe to Gregory and to Augustine, who planted Christianity here, 
as well as to Benedict and St. Bernard, and their indomitable disciples 
and scholars, who reared aloft high standards of i^urity and simplicity 
of work and of duty in a community which was disintegrated under 
the influence of a barbarous soldiery and of brutal and uneducated 
manners. We are further reminded, as we can almost hear the jingling 
spurs and iron-incased feet of the knights tramping down the aisles, 
that it was the romantic enterx^rise of the crusading nobles, prelates, 
and monks which brought back the genius of Gothic architecture to 
Europe, and the taste for poetry, for sentiment, and for art, which 
they had learned from the Saracens, followers of Saladin, and it was 
very largely their handiwork that flooded western Europe with new 
ideas, which blossomed into magnificent forms in our ministers, and the 
equally fresh and novel ideas which Froissart and Chaucer and Malory 
enshrined in immortal verse and prose; and if we turn over the medal 
and look on the other side we shall realize the refiex influence of the 
crusades upon the East. 

I do not propose to carry this disintegrated story further. My pur- 
pose and object have been to press home as a universal factor of human 
progress the element of continuity which we all concede in regard to 
particular cases, and also to j)ress home the lesson that we can not do 
justice to our subject if we limit our horizon, as we are apt to do, to 
our parish, our county, or our island. These are only outlying pieces 
of much larger areas, and the true way of studying and profiting by the 
study of art is not only to be catholic but to be continually conscious 
of its interdependence and continuity. Lastly, one lesson let us carry 
away with us, lest we forget the humility which becomes the students 
of the venerable past. If it is true that we are the heirs of all the ages 
it is true also that the memory of much of our inheritance is blighted 
and sophisticated. It is not exhilarating to our vanity and self-respect 
to think that human progress is not a continual growth — that men reach 
levels very often which those who come after can not emulate. The 
men who built the Parthenon no less than the unknown architects of 
so many of our great ministers, the artifieers who manufactured the 
lovely embroideries, the matchless tiles, the radiant decorations of the 
Alhambra and the Taj at Agra, have left no heirs, and we are mere 
scholars sitting at their feet. Our strength is not great enough to bear 



608 THE METHODS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH. 

the lamps which they carried iu so many ways. Every generation of 
men, it may be, has its triumphs; yet it is not altogether reassuring to 
think that in the great meeting in the happy hunting grounds beyond 
the screen of night it will not be the nineteenth century which will 
occupy the foreground. Homer will still lead the procession of the 
poets, Socrates of the moral philosophers, Phidias of the sculptors, 
Raphael of the painters; and not only so, but we shall have to give 
place to many unknown and unchronicled masters of their crafts in the 
days of old. When that day comes I know not what I shall say to the 
archaeological giants, whose disciple alone I can claim to be, for my pre- 
sumi)tiou in addressing you in this incoherent fashion, save to remind 
them that if the men of Shropshire have not all the gifts of their fore- 
fathers, they still command the virtues of patience and long suffering, 
of urbanity and kindness; and I may be allowed to conclude with the 
hope that the sun may continue to shine brightly on your homes —

THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN.' 



By W. GowLAND, A. R. S. M., F. C. S., F. S. A. 

Late of the Imperial Japanese Mini. 



The art of casting bronze lias been practiced by almost all nations 
from very early times. In Europe at a remote period, long- before the 
dawn of history, we have numerous examples of the skill of primitive 
man as a founder of bronze. Weapons of defense and implements of 
the chase are the chief specimens of his earliest work ; but later, when 
other wants arose beyond the bare necessaries for his existence, we 
find, together with these, objects for personal adornment and domestic 
or ceremonial uses. 

In Asia the earliest practice of the art is shrouded in the mists of 
extreme antiquity. Certain bronze figures from Chaldea are attributed 
to a period not later than 2000 B. C, and, although of very archaic 
form and rude execution, indicate that the casting of bronze must have 
been followed in that country even for many centuries before that 
remote date. 

In Japan the founder's art has a much less antiquity; it does not 
extend back to these distant x^eriods; in fact, no remains of any 
metal castings, even of weapons of defense, have been found there 
approaching in age even those of the early Bronze period in Europe. 

The Japanese do not appear to have migrated to the islands they now 
occui^y earlier than perhaps seven or eight centuries B. C, and the 
aboriginees whom tliey found there were totally unacquainted with the 
use of metals. Hence all objects of metal of the earliest times which 
have been discovered are Japanese, and are not older than that time. 

The evidence afforded by tumuli and dolmens, and the remains found 
in them of the early history and civilization of the Japanese, demon- 
strates clearly that in prehistoric times there were two periods, which 
are more or less clearly defined by the progress which they made in the 
art of metallurgy, viz, a Bronze and an Iron age. The Bronze age 
begins with the immigration of the race, and terminates about the 
second century B. C. The Iron age then commences, and extends to 
the present time.

610 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 

It is worthy of note liere tliat the Bronze age and tlie first period of 
the Iron age are also characterized by two distinct forms of sepnlchral 
monuments, the former by barrows, or simple mounds of earth, and the 
latter by niegalithic dolmens and highly specialized forms of chambered 
tumuli. There is no evidence whatever of a Copper age preceding that 
of Bronze, but contemporaneous with the early Iron age, and up to 
the sixth or seventh centuries A. D., we find copper in more extensive 
use than bronze. Iron swords, trappings, and bits for horses, decorated 
with thin sheets of copper, coated with gold, are found in abundance, 
while objects of bronze are rare. 

THE BRONZE AGE. 

The castings which represent the early Bronze age in Japan consist 
solely of swords and arrowheads, tlie wants of the people then being 
evidently few and simple; and although objects for personal adornment 
were in use, th^y were made exclusively of steatite, jasper, quartz, or 
other stones. The swords are found in barrows or merely buried in 
the ground, and never along with objects of iron ; the arrowheads, on the 
other hand, occasionally occur also in dolmens, associated with iron 
swords, and thus connect the Bronze with the Iron age. These bronze 
swords are undonbtedly the most ancient castings in Japan. They are 
simple two-edged weapons, resembling in form the short sword of the 
ancient Greeks. In some examples the blade is cast in one piece with 
the hilt, but in others with a tang, to which a hilt was subsequently 
attached. The mold was of stone and was made in two pieces. Illus- 
trations of a mold and sword are exhibited. This is the oldest mold 
for casting bronze in existence in Japan. It was found by a Japanese 
archa?ologist in use by some farmers as a hone for sharpening their 
sickles. (I may say here that on my visit to Seoul, the capital of Korea, 
I found stone molds in use for casting simple silver articles, the stone 
being an indurated tuff.) 

I was unable to obtain any fragments or even scrapings of these 
swords for analysis, as there are but few existing, and they are highly 
prized, but a fragment of an arrowhead which I examined consisted 
of copper and tin, and did not contain lead as an essential constituent, 
and the swords are probably of the same alloy. 

EARLY IRON AGE (FROM ABOUT THE SECOND CENTURY B. C. TO 
ABOUT THE SIXTH CENTURY A. D.). 

In my explorations and studies of the remains which occur in the 
ancient Japanese dolmens and chambered tumuli I have always 
observed a marked scarcity of castings of bronze. Circular mirrors, 
small bells, and arrowheads occasionally are found, but they form an 
insignificant part of the contents of a dolmen, the chief objects being 
swords, arrow and spear heads, horse furniture, and other articles of 
iron, many of which are plated with thin sheets of copper, coated gener-

ally witli gold and sometimes with silver. The bells, which are of the 
form called by the Japanese "suzu," are simple hollow spheres with a 
slit cut in the lower half, and contain a loose piece of metal or a small 
round pebble to serve the purpose of a tongue. They rarely occur 
singly, but are usually cast in groups on the edges of a flat support, 
furnished with a hole and tang for attachment probably to a staff or in 
some cases to the trappings of a horse. They appear also to have been 
used as ornamental appendages to garments and the hilts of swords. 

Several plates illustrating their forms and use are exhibited. The 
mirrors are the earliest examples of art castings found in Japan. Many 
are decorated with very elaborate designs, and the excellence displayed 
in the execution of all denotes a very advanced stage in the art of 
molding and casting. Some are undoubtedly Chinese, and others are 
probably native copies of the Obiuese designs, but not a few are of true 
Japanese workmanship. An engraving of a mirror bearing a date— the 
dynastic title Wangmang — 9-23 A. D., is exhibited. 

The five mirrors from the province of Higo, in Kijushu, shown in the 
lantern slide, are said by Japanese archaeologists to be of Chinese origin. 
It is impossible to assign an exact date to the older specimens ; the 
curator of the Imperial Museum, Tokyo, attributes the Chinese forms 
to the period Han (25-220 A. D.), and I am inclined to agree with him 
in this attribution. Three specimens (Gowland collection, British 
Museum), which I obtained from the province of Yamato, were associ- 
ated with "magatama" and other very ancient stone ornaments, and are 
probably not later than the above iieriod. These are almost certainly 
Jai)anese. The simple geometric designs with which they are decorated 
bear no relation to the more elaborate patterns seen on Chinese forms. 

The largest castings of the early Iron age are curious bell-shaped 
objects which are of special interest from their form and archaic orna- 
ment. It has been conjectured that they are temple bells, but they 
l^i-esent no points of resemblance to these or to any instrument or object 
connected with the ceremonies or observances of Buddhism, and are, in 
fact, of earlier date than the introduction of that religion into the coun- 
try. Moreover, none show any signs of having been hung. A consider- 
able number have been found — always buried in the ground — chiefly 
in Yamato, Kawachi, Totomi, and the neighboring provinces. 

As early as 669 A. B. the discovery of one is recorded, and this was 
even then regarded as being of such a great antiquity that it was pre- 
sented to the Emperor. The designs with which they are ornamented — 
the simple geometric line patterns common to many i)rimitive races — 
are also evidences of their great age. They vary in dimensions from 
1 or 2 inches to 5J feet in height, those measuring 1 foot 6 inches to 3 
feet being most common, and all are of extreme thinness compared with 
their size. Their exact use is still a subject of dispute among archae- 
ologists. 

The example shown in the illustration (PI. LXIV) measures 4 feet 6

inches in height and 1 foot 8 inches in diameter at the base, and does 
not exceed three-sixteenths of an inch in thickness. It is an excellent 
casting, and must have been cast in a heated mold. 

SEVENTH AND EIGHTH CENTURIES A. D, 

Two events of marked importance in Jaijanese annals, on account of 
their influence on the tlevelopment of the arts and culture, occurred 
during this x)eriod. Buddhism, which had been introduced about 55li 
A. D., had been adopted as the religion of the country through the 
energy and enthusiasm of Prince Shotoku Taishi (593-G21 A. D.), and a 
fixed capital and court had, for the first time iu Japanese history, been 
established at Nara (709 A. D.). These two centuries form a brilliant 
epoch in the history of the art of bronze founding, as in that of the 
sister arts of painting and sculpture. Numerous temples — some on a 
scale of great magnificence — were erected for the services of the new 
religion, and the skill of both native and foreign workers iu bronze was 
specially enlisted for their decoration, as well a's for the production of 
statues of the divinities of Buddhism and of vessels for the ceremonies 
of its ritual. 

Stimulated and sujiported by the priesthood in their efforts to produce 
objects worthy of the services of the church, the bronze founders 
achieved results in those early times which have not since been sur- 
passed. Unfortunately many of their works have been destroyed by 
conflagrations and in the frequent spoliation of the temples during civil 
wars, but a few have beeu preserved which are masterpieces of the art 
of the modeler and founder. 

Many tales record the enthusiasm with which the founders of the time 
were supported by tbeir patrons and of the stubborn manner in which, 
after many repeated failures, they overcame the difficulties which beset 
them. The Empress Koken (749-758) herself is said to have aided the 
founders in stirring the molten metal for a statue of a Buddhist saint, 
which was only completed after six unsuccessful attempts. The devel- 
opment of bronze founding and the encouragement of its artists during 
this period was entirely due to Buddhism, and even for many centuries 
later the chief works of the art founders were executed for the adornment 
of its shrines. The survival of most of the older bronzes is also solely 
due to the care with Avhich they have been preserved in temples and 
monasteries by the priests of that religion. 

Japanese records and traditions relating to the works of art of this 
epoch, whether of the painter, sculptor, or founder, invariably sj^eak of 
the help afforded in their production by Korean or Chinese artists, and 
not a few of the ancient examples which survive are even attributed 
solely to them. 

It is very difficult to determine how far these traditions relating to 
Korean artists are trustworthy, as no traces of similar works have been 
fouud Ml Korea itself; yet they all present such a close agreement on 
the point, that we are almost compelled to acknowledge that, if not

Early Iron Casting. 



THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 613 

perhaps true iu the details they give of individual artists, yet, broadly 
speaking, they may be based ou facts, and that the Japanese owe to 
Koreans, or probably rather to Chinese who may have come through 
Korea, the first great advances which they made in the casting of bronze. 

Besides the intiuence which the neighboring countries — China and 
Korea — had on the technique and motives of the Japanese bronze foun- 
der, we have also abundant evidence of the influence of the art of more 
distant regions. Among the treasures of the temple Horyuji (near 
Kara, Yamato) are several Indian statues m bronze of Buddhist saints 
and deities, and a curious ewer, which are said to have been iu the pos- 
session of the temple from the date of its erection in the early part of 
the seventh century. The characteristic pose of the figures, the model- 
ing of their features, and their jeweled headdresses have been fre- 
quently copied with more or less modification, and cau be distinctly 
traced in many ancient Japanese statues, as well as in some of com- 
paratively modern times. The ewer, a bronze casting of graceful form, 
is decorated with figures of winged horses of the form of the Pegasus 
of the ancients. According to Longperier (Gonse, " L'Art Japonais") it 
is undoubtedly Sassauian and oi earlier date than the seventh cen- 
tury. An illustration is given of it in the '' Handbook " of the ancient 
articles in the temple Horyuji, which will be fauud ou the table. This 
ewer is of special interest, as, by the kindness of my friend Mr. Alfred 
Cock, I am able to show you a bronze incense burner, which has been 
modeled probably during the last century from one of the pegasi with 
which it is ornamented. Other bronzes of foreign origin are also to be 
seen in tbe treasure houses of several of the ancient temples in Yamato. 

During the epoch, especially that part of it which has been styled the 
"Kara period" (the seven reigns during which Kara was the caijital, 
709-784), the great development in bronze founding was not the only 
advance made in the working of metals, but the art of incised and 
repousse work in gilt copper, which had been practiced during the 
early Iron age, was brought to a stage of perfection beyond which it 
has never passed. A specimen of this work will be found on the table, 
and others are illustrated in the colored plates near it. 

The examj)les contained in the following list I have selected as rep- 
resentative specimens of the art of bronze founding during this period 
(seventh and eighth (centuries). 

Date 690 to 702 A. I). — Three bronze figures representing a Buddhist 
trinity — Amitabha, Kwanyin, and Mahasthama — that of Amitablni 
being about 9 feet m height. They resemble the Indian examples at 
Horyuji in being originally gilt, but the bronze of which they consist 
is of a different composition, not containing zinc as an essential con- 
stituent. 

Date 690 to 702 A. D. — A colored seated image of Yakushi (the heal- 
ing divinity), about C feet high, with two attendant deities, cast of a 
coi)per-tin-lead bronze. 

All the above are in the temple Yakushiji in Nara. Illustrations of 



614 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 

the latter gronj) are given in two plates from tbe Pictorial Arts of 
Japan, by Prof. J. W. Anderson, which are on the table. 

Date 705 A. D. — A spherical box of gilt bronze, bearing this date, 
which was found in a stone sarcophagus at Ten-o-ji, near Osaka, is inter- 
esting, as it is probably the oldest dated piece of Japanese metal work 
in the country. 

Date 708 A. D. — Bronze coins, " Wado-zeni," the earliest coinage in 
Japan of which there is any record. According to Japanese histories 
copper is said to have been discovered in the country only in G98 A. D., 
but the accuracy of this statement, for many reasons, is open to doubt, 
and the discovery chronicled doubtless only relates to the finding of 
deposits of ore of more than usual extent and richness. The issue of 
this coinage, which was cast from copper from these deposits, was 
regarded as an event of great national importance, and to commemo- 
rate it the "nen-go," or name of the period by which the series of years 
are distinguished in Japanese chronology, was altered to "Wa-do," 
which signifies Japanese copper. Besides these there were three other 
distinct coinages during this century. 

Date 732 A. D. — The great bronze bell of the temple Todaiji, in l^ara. 
Its aijproximate dimensions are, height, 13 feet; diameter, 9 feet; thick- 
ness, 8 to 10 inches. Its weight can not be easily determined, as its 
thickness is variable, but at the lowest estimate can not be much less 
than 40 tons. 

Date 749 A. D. — Colossal image of Rochana or Yairotchana, in the 
temple of Todaiji, commonly known as the Nara Daibutsu. 

This is the largest bronze figure in the country. It has not, however, 
been cast in one piece, but is constructed chiefly of numerous pieces of 
comparatively small size. Some of the lower portions have been cast 
by building up the mold on the parts already finished, but the greater 
part of the image consists of separate castings, which have been united 
by running in an alloy containing large proportions of tin and lead 
between their edges. 

The following dimensions are those given on a wood engraving of the 
image — one of which is exhibited — sold by the priests of the temple, and 
may be considered as only approximately accurate: Height, 53.2 feet; 
breadth of face, 9.4 feet; length of eye, 3.9 feet; thickness, variable, 
3 to 12 inches. 

The figure is seated on a huge lotus flower with fifty-six external 
petals, each of which measures 10 feet 6 inches by 6 feet, and appears 
to be a single casting. Twice it has been iia-rtially destroyed by con- 
flagrations and once by an earthquake. The present head, cast in the 
sixteenth century, is extremely ugly, destitute of any trace of the 
grace and refined expression of the earlier statues, and not at all in 
harmony with the ancient parts of the figure. 

The authorities of the temple state that the image is composed of 
" shakudo" (a copper alloy containing gold). They also give the weights 
of the copper, tin, gold, and mercury, which were used in casting it, and

these statements have been repeated by many writers. Tbey are alto- 
gether without any foundation in fact. I have had many opportunities 
of examining it, and although I never succeeded in getting a portion 
for analysis, yet from the streak, hardness, and color of the metal it is 
undoubtedly a variety of "karakaue" (a copper-tin-lead alloy), and the 
gold and mercury said to have been used in its manufacture were sim- 
j)ly employed for gilding its surface and not as constituents of the alloy 
of whicli it is cast. Four hundred and fifty tons of metal are said to 
have been used in its construction. If its average thickness is as 
much as 7 inches, and it is probably less, its weight must be less than 
300 tons. The two following objects are examples of the smaller works 
of the period : 

Bate 749 A. D. — Bronze bell, with curious ornamental tongue, now in 
the temjile Todaiji (ISTara). Dated 2d day, 5th month, 1st year Tembyo 
Shd-hd. This is of importance, as it is another of the earliest bronzes 
which bears a date, but, unfortunately, no artist's name. 

Bate eighth century. — Lantern of bronze and incised gilt copper in the 
courtyard of the same temple. Its eight sides are decorated with Bud- 
dhist figures, conventional representations of hares and other auimals, 
and fine arabesciues in opeu work. A photograi)h of this lantern is 
exhibited. 

A gong-shaped bell, suspended between two well-modeled dragons 
belonging to the temple KO-buku-ji, in Nara, is attributed to this period. 

A Buddhist image from the collection of M. Bing, of Paris, of the 
the same period. 

FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE NINTH TO THE END OF THE TWELFTH 

CENTURY. 

Near the close of the preceding epoch the court was removed to the 
city of Kioto, which from that time (794 A. D.) up to 1808 continued to 
be the imperial capital. This removal of the court was a severe blow 
to the art life of the ancient city; and the works and traditions of its 
old bronze founders soon appear to have been forgotten or neglected in 
the new metropolis. 

Prom tlie beginning of the ninth until near the end of the twelfth 
century, a space of nearly four hundred years, we have a period of stag- 
nation if not of decadence in all art, yet, strange to say, it embraces 
the golden age of literature, during which the famous classical romances 
were written. Its first half, as shown by these romances, was marked 
by effeminacy; during its second the country was plunged in civil war. 
The romances gives us but little information of the individual and art 
life of the people, and the pages of its histories are solely devoted to 
records of the jealousies and feuds of the great families of Pujiwara, 
Taira, and Minamoto. 

Until near its termination we have no record of the erection of any 
temple of note or of the execution of any groat art work; and I have 
been unable to find any examples of tbe art of the bronze founder 



616 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAK 

during- the entire period, excepting two insignificant boxes for holding 
seals (dated respectively 908 and 1098 A. D.) and nine distinct coin- 
ages of bronze money (from 810 to 958 A. D,). After this last date even 
the coinage of money appears to cease, and is not resumed until 1457 
A. D. — live hundred years afterwards. 

THIRTEENTH CENTURY. 

During the hist years of the twelfth century, when peace was estab- 
lished throughout the country by the victories of Yoritomo, there are 
the first signs of a revival of the old art of the Kara period. From 
1190 A. D. up to the date of his death (1198 A. D.), this remarkable 
warrior devoted all his energies to the cultivation and advancement 
of the arts of peace. Stimulated by his example and enthusiasm, the 
artistic spirit of the people was aroused from its dormant condition, 
and for nearly a liundred years we have a notable period of renaissance 
in art, a period chiefly remarkable in the history of bronze for the 
casting of that magnificent masterpiece the colossal image of Amit- 
abha, usually called the Daibutsu of Kamakura. This image, one of the 
finest examples of bronze founding, can not be adequately described 
by any word painting; it must be actually seen in the midst of its 
grove of conifers and evergreens to appreciate fully its grandeur and 
beauty, its soberness of design, and noble expression of majesty and 
repose. It stands alone and incomparable among all the chefs d'deuvre 
of Japanese bronze founders. 

Although slightly smaller than the great Buddha of JS^ara, it far 
excels it in artistic execution. Like it it has been cast in segments, 
but these have been "burned together" with bronze of similar compo- 
sition to tliat of the image itself^ the exterior of the joints having been 
subsequently finished by chiseling. 

Japanese histories relate that it was cast about the middle of the 
thirteenth century (begun 1252 A D.) by Ono Goroyemon, one of the 
first bronze founders whose name is recorded. Its dimensions, taken 
from a woodcut sold to pilgrims who visit its shrine, are as follows: 
Height, 49 feet 7 inches; length of face, 8 feet 5 inches; breadth from 
knee to knee, 35 feet 8 inches. 

The measurements of both this and the Nara Buddha, however, 
require revision ; the heights in both cases are, 1 think, exaggerated, 
and should have 6 or 7 feet deducted from them. Its thickness is vari- 
able, ranging from 1^ inches to 3 or 4 inches, or even more in some of 
the castings, and its weight will not probably exceed 150 tons. 

Other bronze images of the divinities of the Buddhist hierarchy, of 
less colossal proportions and of varying degrees of excellence, were 
made for the temples of Yamato and Kioto, one of the chief groups 
being a trinity for the ancient monastery Horyuji. Several bells were 
also cast, one at Kamakura being worthy of note, as the record given 
of it indicates the source of the metal from which they were occasion- 
ally made. It is said that 300,000 copper coins, which had been 



THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 617 

collected by the priests of the temple, were melted down for casting- it, 
and tlie metal being insnfificient, tlie casting was afaihire; 3(),(I0() more 
coins were then collected for addition to the defective bell, when it was 
remelted. It is also recorded that cojiper coins were similarly melted 
up for casting Buddhist images and ornamental utensils, hence it would 
appear that it was not then deemed necessary to use a different alloy 
for bells and art castings than for coins. 

FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH CENTURIES. 

During the lourteenth and fifteenth centuries we have again a period 
of decadence, with the exception of two short brilliant intervals, the first 
during the supremacy of tlie Ashikaga Shdgun, Yoshimitsu (1368-1493 
A. D.), and the second during that of Ashikaga loshimasa (1440-1471 A. 
D,). For the greater part of this period the country was again in a state 
of unrest and intestine conflict, and the arts of peace found but little 
encouragement, excepting so far as they contributed to the needs of war. 

Workers in iron are brilliantly rei)resented by one of the greatest of 
the famous forgers of sword blades, Masamune, and by several dis- 
tinguished armorers and smiths of the renowned Miochin family; but 
the bronze founder was not in request. His chief work during these 
two centuries was a colossal figure of the Buddha Vairotchana, cast 
during the time of Yoshimasa for the temple at Hase (Kamakura). I 
have not seen this image, but it is said to be an admirable casting and 
to measure 30 feet G inches in height. 

Two bronzes which were exhibited at Nara in 1888 represent the 
smaller castings of the period, one an incense burner, which was pre- 
sented by the hero Kusunoki Masa-shige (first half of the fourteenth 
century) to the temple at Hase (Yamato), and a war bell also given by 
him to the Emperor Godaigo. 

SIXTEENTH CENTURY. 

In the last decade of this century, after another period of civil war, 
the patron of art and culture is again a famous warrior, Hideyoshi 
(often laiown as Taiko Sama). Although then engaged in war with 
Korea, the closing years of his life were devoted to jieaceful pursuits at 
home, and in imitation of Yoritoino at Kamakura, he erected a huge 
Buddha and a temple to contain it at Kioto. On the destruction of 
the image, which was of wood, by an earthquake only eight years after 
its erection, he contemplated replacing it by one of bronze, but the 
execution of this was delayed by his death (1598 A. D.), and was only 
accomplished by his son and widow sixteen years afterwards. 

No large bronzes of importance appear to have been cast during this 
century. Two specimens of the smaller bronzes are exhibited, one a 
a figure of Y'akushi (the healing divinity), belonging to my friend Mr. 
Alfred Cock, in which the deity is represented holding a crystal ball, an 
emblem of purity, in his left hand. It bears the names of its dedicators 
to the temple and the date 1509. 



618 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 

The other is a bell of the form known as " waniguchi/' crowned with 
the figure of a tortoise encircled by the coils of a snake, kindly lent by 
my friend Mr. Harding Smith. It also bears the name of its dedicator 
and the date 1593. 

Several specimens of dedicatory bronzes of this time are to be found 
not only in Buddhist temples but also in Shinto shrines. Two examples 
of the latter may be mentioned, although they are notable rather for 
the fame of their donors than for their artistic excellence; a gigantic 
bell of sinular form to the last offered by Hideyoshi to the Shinto shrine 
at Nachi (Kyushu) and a large mirror (3 feet diameter) dedicated to 
the Tenjin Miya at Kitano (Kioto) by Kato Kiyomasa, oneof Hideyoshi^s 
noted generals in the Korean camj)aign. 

I can not omit to show you on the screen a magnificent bronze in the 
famous Cernuschi collection in Paris, which is attributed to this period. 
It is supported on a pedestal of rich open work, and is decorated with 
gourds and an heraldic representation of the leaf and flowers of the 
Paulownia imperialis. 

Another splendid example of " cera perduta " casting of this period 
is a group of egrets, standing upon an inverted lotus leaf, which has 
been kindly lent by my friend Mr. Alfred Cock. 

SEVENTEENTH CENTURY AND FIRST HALF OF THE EiaHTEENTH. 

In 1603 Tokugawa lyeyasu, a man of remarkable ability, both as a 
warrior and as a statesman, succeeded to the Shogunate, and by his 
wisdom and foresight established on firm foundations the Japanese 
system of feudalism, which, under the rule of his successors, gave 
absolute peace to the country for more than two and a half centuries, 
and resulted in an advance and develoiiment of the arts unparalleled 
in any jjrevious age. 

During the supremacy of these Tokugawa Shoguns, the painter, the 
lacquerer, the potter, and the founder were encouraged and stimulated 
as they had never been before to bring their respective arts to the high- 
est point of excellence; and it is in no small degree owing to the works 
which they produced during this jieriod that Japan owes the promi- 
nent position which she now so deservedly occupies in the world of art. 

The first great works of the bronze founders of the seventeenth 
century were a colossal figure of the Buddhist divinity Eochaua, in 
Kioto, to replace the wooden image destroyed by an earthquake in the 
previous century, and a huge bell for its temple. 

The figure is said to have been 58i feet high, and from the records 
regarding the first attempt to cast it, it would appear that it was cast 
in situ and in segments, the mold being built up on the parts already 
finished. It would thus, when completed, have been practically a 
single ijiece of metal. This attempt was a failure, as when casting 
the lower part of the head the wooden scaffolding was set on fire 
by the operations and the image partly melted. It was successfully 
completed in 1G14, but only forty-eight years afterwards, like its wooden

predecessor, it was destroyed by au earthquake. Accordiug to official 
records its fragments were melted in 1608-1G8.3 and cast into the 
bronze coins (Kwan-ei-tsu-ho) then current.' 

This record is interesting, as it aftords another proof that the alloy 
used by bronze founders did not differ much in composition, if at all, 
from that in use at the time m the mints for coins. I have analyzed 
these coins, with the following results : Individual coins differed con- 
siderably from one another in composition, the percentage of copper 
present varying from 60.8 to 86.8, a variation not greater, however, 
than might be expected from the nature of the alloy and the mode in 
which it was cast. Hence, in order to ascertain their average composi- 
tion, 7,600 pieces were melted together, and the resulting metal was 
analyzed and found to consist of —

We may hence not unreasonably conclude that this represents, 
approximately, the composition of the alloy which was used for 
casting the colossal Buddha. 

The bell is the largest in 
Japan. Its dimensions are, ap- 
proximately, height, 14 feet; 
external diameter at the mouth, 
9 feet; thickness at the rim, 
10| inches. In section these 
bells differ from European 
form in having the rim thick- 
ened internally, so that their 
mouths are constricted. (Fig. 
1.) And it is this constric- 
tion which causes the gentle 
rising and falling tones which 
characterize the boom of all 
Japannese bells. It is hardly 
necessary to mention that 
these bells are not swung, 
neither are they famished 
with tongues, but are rung by 
striking the outside by means 
of a beam of wood suspended 
from the bell tower and swung like a battering ram. The point 
struck is a low boss, which sometimes has the form of a lotus flower.

a The weight of this hell is often erroneously given hj' writers as 74 tons. 

The exact average thickness of these bells can not be ascertained 
without special measurements, which are not permitted, but it can not 
exceed 8 inches, the thickness I have assumed for the above calcula- 
tions, and may possibly be somewhat less. The casting of a large bell 
in old times in Japan was an important event, and was accompanied by 
religious ceremonies and popular rejoicings. On the day appointed for 
running the metal into the mold a grand festival was held at the tem- 
ple in the grounds of which the founding operations were performed, 
and people of all ranks came from far and near with contributions, many 
with offerings of mirrors, hairpins, and metal ornaments, to be added 
to the bronze in the furimces. On one occasion, that of the founding 
of the great bell of Zo-joji, the Shoguu himself (lye-initsu) was not 
only present, but took i)art in the direction of the operations. In 
succeeding years the day was not forgotten, but its anniversary was 
celebrated by temple feasts. 

The fame and repute of this " golden " period in the bronze founder's 
art does not however rest on the above castings, which are cliietly 
remarkable for their size and weight, but on those now to be described, 
many of which are masterpieces of design, modeling, and technical 
skill. 

The oldest of these are the bronzes cast for the mortuary chapels and 
tombs of the early Tokugawa Shoguns and members of their families. 
At the famous mausoleum at Xikko there are some grand examples, one 
of the most notable being the tomb of lyeyasu (the first Tokugawa Sho- 
gun, died 1604 A. D.), a fine casting in bronze, with bronze gates, dis- 
tinguished by impressive simplicity and chasteness of design (PI. LXV). 
In front of the tomb are the three ceremonial ornaments (Sangusoku) of 
the Buddhist altar, viz, a vase, incense burner, and candlestick, all of 
the severe style of the period. 

The gates (PI. LXVI) are splendid examples of bronze founding. 
Almost their whole surface is covered with delicate diaper and tloral 
patterns, upon which ground the bolder ornamentation is molded in relief. 
These consist of representations of the ''chakra," or Buddhist wheel of

the law, and floral designs, uiost of which are coated with gold. In 
front are the two fabulous animals (Koma-inu and Ama-inu) supposed 
to represent lions. 

The tomb of lyemitsu (third Tokuwaga Shogun, died 1649 A. D.) 
closely resembles that of lyeyasu in form, but the reliefs on its bronze 
gates are simply Sanscrit characters in medallions. These tombs are 
situated in a grove behind the chapels and oratory, and their simplicity 
presents a striking contrast to the magnificence of these edifices, which 
are the most richly decorated shrines in the world. It is said that their 
plain and simple design is intended as a concrete expression of the 
Buddhist ajihorism that " at death there is an end to all magnificence." 

Numerous large standard lanterns (toro) of bronze (PL LXYII), con- 
tributed by the territorial nobles, who vied with one another in thus doing 
honor to their departed chiefs, line the courtyards of the shrines. Many 
hundreds of these "toro," which were favorite votive offerings of the 
wealthy both to Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, were cast during 
this period of revival in bronze founding. They adorn the approaches 
and grounds of every temple of note in the country, those of Zo-jo-ji 
(Tokyo) alone number more than two hundred.' 

Each group or pair di tiers from any other, yet in outline and decora- 
tion all are in harmony; and if no other examples of bronze founding 
were in existence, the gracefulness of form and fertility of design which 
characterizes all would alone mark their modelers and founders as art- 
ists of the first rank. It will be noticed that both of these in the illus- 
tration, although of the same general form, differ entirely in decoration. 

The mausolea of other Tokugawa Shoguns also afford some fine 
examj^les of the bronze founders' art, notably the tombs of lye-tsuna 
(1G50-1680), andTsuuayoshi (1681-1708), at Uyena (Tokyo), andof lye- 
uobu (1709-1712), at Shiba (Tokyo). They are of similar form to those 
at Nikko, differing from them chiefly in the more elaborate decoration of 
their gates. Finely modeled dragons and the armorial badge of the 
Tokugawas ornament the gates of lye-nobu's tomb, while in the tomb 
of Tsunayoshi — who was a noted patron of art — there is still a further 
departure from the simple style of earlier times, the symbolical combi- 
nations of the fabulous unicorn (Kirin) and pine tree, the phoenix (Hoo) 
and x>aulownia, and 6f the pine, bamboo, and plum being perhaps 
almost too lavishly emuployed. 

Another important bronze at Nikko, representative of the period, is 
a bronze column (1619 A. B.), termed so-rin-to, 42 feet in height, a form 
of the Indian " stupa," as introduced into Japan through China. Before 
removal to its present site it stood near the tomb of lyeyasu, and was 
doubtless erected there in accordance with the Chinese superstitious 
beliefs in the eflicacy of such structures in warding off evil influences 
and insuring the protection of Heaven. Besides these, four huge lotus

petals, for tlie base of the image of the Daibutsu at Kamakura, were 
cast at the beginniug of the eighteenth century (1717). A small bronze 
of the seventeenth century I am enabled to show you through the kind- 
ness of Mr. W. Cleverly Alexander; it is an incense burner, in the 
form of two rats, by Meiho. Also a candlestick for the Buddhist altar, 
decorated with a dragon coiled round its stem, from the collection of 
Mr. Alfred Cock. Two other candlesticks of the seventh century, or 
probably earlier, have been kindly lent by Mr. E, W. Heunell. 

FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY UP TO THE 

PRESENT TIME. 

Hitherto the skill of the bronze founders had been chiefly exerted in 
the production of colossal images and other huge castings for the tem- 
l)le of Buddha, and in giving a severe beauty to the forms and orna- 
ments of utensils and implements for ceremonial purposes ; but during 
this period, with the continuation of peace their art found a wider 
range in the designing of objects for secular use for the decoration of 
the home and the everyday needs of life. 

Shortly before, the okimono, or ornament, a thing of no practical 
utility, but only of display, had been introduced, and this specially 
opened up to the artist a rich and unlimited field for the exercise of his 
ingenuity and skill in the art of ornament and design. The vase, too, 
formerly used only as a ceremonial vessel of the Buddhist altar, now 
became a necessary object for the adornment of private life, and in its 
form and decoration the artist was no longer hampered by the old tradi- 
tions and rules ot the church. The founders of this period hence are 
not chiefly notable, as in earlier times, for the works destined for the 
services of Buddhism or the embellishment of its shrines, although 
many remarkable castings were made, principally standard lanterns, 
dedicated as votive offerings to temples and monasteries, and torii, or 
gateways of Shinto shrines, but owe their world -wide fame to the skill 
and fertility of design exhibited in the objects above mentioned for 
household use, many of which are masterpieces of form and ornament. 
The following characteristic examples of Buddhist art can not, however, 
be omitted from my account of this period: 

Date 1736 A. D. — A fine image of Sakya-muui, in the grounds of 
Zojoji (Tokyo). 

Bate 1765 A. D. — A colossal figure of Kwanyin, 9 to 10 feet high, 
near the post town of Futagawa, on the Tokaidd. 

Date 1778 A. D. — An image of Sakya-muni (7 to 8 feet high?), in the 
courtyard of Jo-shin-ji, Tokyo. 

End of eighteenth century. — An image of Amitabha, formerly at IMeguro, 
near Tokyo, now in the Cernuschi collection (Paris). Height from the 
base of the lotus flower to the top of the nimbus 11 feet 9 inches.

THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 623 

Mr. Alfred Cock, is an excellent example of the Buddhist art of the 
period. 

The period is also marked by an important naturalistic monument 
in the schools of both pictorial and glyptic art. 

They had up to this time followed the older men in basing their 
designs on the traditious of Buddliism and the forms and motives of 
Chinese and occasionally of Indian art, but now they began to break 
away from the trammels by which they were bound to these old con- 
ventional forms and motives, and to go to nature for their inspirations 
and models. 

It should, however, be remembered that much as the works, espe- 
cially of Chinese artists, were admired, mere slavish copies were never 
or rarely made of them; thus in the bronzes even of the early days, the 
figures of Buddhist divinities, there is a serenity of expression and 
graceful arrangement of drapery which we look for iu vain in the mas- 
terpieces of Chinese art. Nearly contemporaneous with the establish- 
ment of the Shijo-rui — the school of naturalistic painting — in Kioto, 
by the famous painter Okyo, we find the art founders adopting these 
new motives and new modes of representing the old. Stiff geometric 
designs give place to those based on natural forms, and even in repre- 
sentations of the mythical dragon we see, as has been pointed out by 
Professor Anderson, "distinct evidences of direct study of snake form." 

Students of natural objects, of plantr*and animal life, were now made, 
the designs of the naturalistic paiuters were followed, and an impulse 
was given to the art of bronze founding greater than had been known 
since the Kara period. 

For a little more than three-quarters of a century we have another 
golden age in its history, during which a succession of brilliant artists, 
distinguished by marvelous technical skill and originality of design, 
worthily maintained the best traditions of the founders' art, and Japan 
attained a position in cera perduta casting which she had never reached 
before. 

Two men, Seimin and Toiin, stand out prominently during the closing 
years of the last century and the first quarter of the present. Others, 
among whom should be mentioned Harutoshi, Kunihisa, Kamejo, Teijo, 
Taiichi, approach these great masters in skill, even occasionally proving 
their equals. The work of these famous artists is well represented by 
the specimens on the table, the most important of which are from the 
collections of my friends Mr. Alfred Cock, Mr. Mills, Mr. Alfred Par- 
sons, and Mr. J. M. Swan, and by PI. LXVIII, fig. 1, a group of tortoises 
from the collection of Mr. J. M. Swan, and PI. LXVIII, fig. 2, a brazier 
from the collection of Mr. Alfred Cock. 

In examining their works it will be noticed that, as among the paint- 
ers, several were specially distinguished for their skill in the repre- 
sentation of certain motives — Sosen as a painter of monkeys, Gauku 



624 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 

of tigers, Okyo of carp, etc. — so among the founders several are 
similarly renowned ; thus Seimin chiefly owes his fame to the perfect 
modeling of his tortoises, Toiiu Somin for the vigor and life expressed 
in their dragons, and Kamejo for the delicate and truthful rendering of 
her quails. It is needless to say that they did not confine themselves 
to these, but executed other works not less demonstrative of their skill. 

The human figure, however, does not form i)art of their naturalistic 
studies. The forms and movements of lower annual life are expressed 
with a truthfulness which has never been surpassed, but in representing 
man they seem rarely to have been able to free themselves from the 
conventionalities of the art dogmas of the old Sinico-Japanese schools, 
and seldom show even traces of that close observation of nature which 
characterizes their other works. 

One of the finest examples is a seated figure of Ban-kurobe in the 
garb of a ])ilgrim, cast by Murata Kunihisa, in 1783 ("now in the famous 
Cernuschi collection, Paris). PI. LXIX. 

Portrait statues are of extreme rarity, those representing famous 
personages being merely conventional creations which are supposed to 
portray the type or class to which they belonged rather than the indi- 
viduals themselves. This example would seem to be one in which an 
attempt has been made to produce with truthfulness a characteristic 
likeness of the man whom it is intended to commemorate. 

With the death of the last representative of this brilliant group of 
art founders near the end of the first half of the present century, the 
art gradually x)assed into a stage of decadence, the lowest depths of 
which it but recently reached, and from which it is only just emerging. 

Vast numbers of bronzes have indeed been cast, but they are too 
often of meretricious design and tawdry ornament, or debased copies 
of the creations of Seimin, Toiin, and their distinguished contempora- 
ries. Fortunately there are a few notable exceptions to this later 
statement. In the first decades of the second half of tlds century 
Dosai, Gidd, Somin, Joun, Tanchosai, Toryusai, andlzan (specimens of 
whose works are exhibited) did much excellent work, and ably sustained 
under considerable difficulties the reputation of their famous predeces- 
sors. Among more recent founders, a distinguished position should be 
given to Suzuki Chokichi (now living), whose well-known magnificent 
example of cera perduta casting is in the South Kensington Museum. 
It is an ancient incense burner with doves and peacocks, the doves 
especially being nuisterpieces of modeling, and an embodiment in 
bronze of the highest developments of the naturalistic school, of which 
Chokichi is an earnest and ardent follower. 

And I here should like to say a word on the excessive crude and vul- 
gar ornament which disfigures too many modern Japanese bronzes. 
Such ornament is never found on any vase, brazier, or other object 
intended for use by the Japanese themselves, but is confined to those 
articles specially made for sale to foreigners. (The collection exhibited

to illustrate the forms and ornaments of Japanese bronzes before the 
oiDening of the country to foreign trade amply demonstrates this.) 
These are all veritable " pot-boilers " cast by men often capable of doing 
better things, who earn more by the production of these vulgar mon- 
strosities for exportation than others who still endeavor to follow the 
simple canons of Japanese art. Modern Jai^anese bronze founders, 
like their brethren in pictorial art, hence work in an adverse environ- 
ment, and under many disadvantages unknown to their predecessors. 
In the early centuries religious enthusiasm, the quiet seclusion of tbe 
monastery, and the patronage of a powerful priesthood stimulated, 
fostered, and supi)orted the old artists in their work, so that all their 
powers were put forth in the execution of the grand masterpieces of 
those times. 

In later times the same result was achieved under the system of 
feudalism which i)revailed in the country. Workers in bronze were 
attached to the courts of the greater daimyos (territorial noble); 
their incomes were secure, they were free to work out their designs as 
they wished, and need only do so when they felt inspired. 

During recent years the Emperor has done much for the encourage- 
ment of a select few of the chief art workers in bronze in the revival 
of their old art, the result being that some of the objects of modern 
work which adorn the imperial palace are of extreme beauty, and 
equal those of the older masters in gracefulness of form and sobriety 
of ornament. But for the great majority there is no such patronage, 
yet the bronze founders must live, and to live means for too many that 
they must waste their talents in producing work in designing which they 
are hampered by the demands of commerce and the chief, or rather sole, 
end of which is merely pecuniary remuneration. Up to the eighteenth 
century we rarely find the name of the artist or founder attached to 
any bronze. Most of the existing specimens of the earlier bronzes 
were made, as we have seen, for use in the ceremonies and ritual of 
the Buddliist religion, and were not usually allowed to bear any name, 
excepting when they were ex voto offerings, and then only the names 
of the donors. The records of the temples are also silent, with few 
exceptioiis, even on the authorship of the grand masterpieces to which 
they often owe their popularity and fame. The dedicators alone are 
remembered and the artists forgotten. Being almost invariably men of 
plebeian origin, the bronze founders occui)ied a lower status in life than 
the caligrapher, painter, or armorer, and their lives have not been 
thought worthy of record. All the knowledge we have of even the 
great masters of the last generation is derived solely from their works 

Several charming specimens of both the larger and smaller bronzes, 
esi^ecially of the latter, as late as the last hundred years, are unfortu- 
nately not signed (see especially the candlesticks of fine open work lent 
by Sir Trevor Lawrence), and many of equal merit are signed by artists 
whose names do not appear in the lists of noted bronze workers. So

that the materials for a history of the men themselves, such as has been 
comi)iled of tlieir fellow-artists the painters, do not exist; and are but 
scanty and incomi)lete, even for a record of their works. 

This will conclude the first part of my paper. I must ai)ologize for 
the fragmentary character of the account I have attempted to give you 
of the rise and development of bronze founding in Japan, and will ask 
you to regard it merely as a collection of notes which may be of use in 
the compilation of its history when further materials are brought to 
light. I have i)urposely omitted from it the consideration of tlie guards 
(tsuba) and other furniture of the sword, because they are more partic- 
ularly the work of the chaser and carver of metals than of the founder, 
and also because the subjects of their designs and their technical exe- 
cution extends over such a wide field that a special paper would be 
required for their adequate treatment.

THE TECHNICS OF JAPANESE BRONZE FOUNDING. 

Several methods of casting metals have been practiced by the Jap- 
anese. In the earliest times molds of stone, in which the shape of the 
object was cut, sufficed for the simple forms of their ancient weapon; 
and although they are no longer employed in the casting of bronze? 
their use still survives in the casting of lead for some industrial pur- 
poses, and of small silver bars, which have subsequently to be worked 
with the hammer into jewelry and ornaments. Somewhat later, molds 
of clay were introduced, probably by Chinese, and it is almost certain 
that contemporaneous with their adoption the method of cera perduta 
casting was first practiced. 

Casting in molds of sand or loam is also of an early date. In 708 
A. D. it was in use in the mint for the production of bronze coins. At 
present it is chiefly employed for small or flat objects — plain or only 
roughly ornamented — and for castings for industrial uses. 

These methods have been followed in some form or other by almost 



THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 627 

all nations, but I may mention en passant — although it hardly comes 
within the scope of this paper — another method which is essentially 
Japanese, i. e., the casting of refined copper in canvas molds in hot 
water. Specimens of copper so cast for the use of the bronze founder 
are on the table. It is also used occasionally, but rarely, for silver, 
never for bronze. 

One mode of casting they have never practiced, that is, what is 
called the "ascending" method, in which the ingates are so arranged 
that the molten metal enters the mold at its base and gradually rises 
and fills its cavity. They have, however, introduced a modification in 
the "descending," or ordinary method — which will be described later — 
to minimize some of its disadvantages, the chief of which are, as is well 
known to founders, the occasional formation of "cold sets"^ on the 
core and sides of the mold, and unsoundness in the castings due to the 
entanglement of air in the streams of metal when falling from the top 
of a high mold. 

It will be seen from the descriptions which follow of the operations 
of the Japanese bronze founder that, while in their general features 
they have much in common with those of the bronze founder in Europe, 
they present some differences of greater or less importance, differ, 
ences which are chiefly found in certain details of manipulation which 
are the results of the conditions under which the Jai)anese founder 
has worked, the composition of his chief alloy, and the nature of his 
training. 

Before proceeding to consider these operations, we will first glance 
briefly at the founder himself. He was — as I have stated above — 
almost without exception of the plebeian class of the people, and 
although many at various periods were men of marvelous ability and 
of the highest merit as artists, yet they seem never to have ranked 
higher than artisans. Several sculptors in metal, who were specially 
distinguished for their skill in the design and ornament of the furni- 
ture of the sword, and many noted smiths, forgers of famous blades 
and of armor, were indeed elevated above this grade, and had the 
honor of receiving complimentary titles in recognition of their ability; 
but I have not succeeded in finding a single example of an art founder 
having been similarly honored. 

Ko special courses of study, such as were followed by painters, were 
open to him. A knowledge of the principles and practice of his art had 
to be obtained under a system of apprenticeship, whicli had much in 
common with that in vogue in Europe during the latter part of the 
Middle Ages, and in which drudgery and household work absorbed not 
a little of his time. As an apprentice he was bound to serve his master 
for a fixed term of years, during which his duties were not only to assist 

i^Cold sets," metal which has been splashed up against the sides of the mold or

628 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 

in the actual work of the foundry and studio, but also to attend to the 
j)ersonal wants of his master. He lived in his master's house, was fed 
and clothed by him, and became in fact a minor member of his family. 

During his apprenticeship he was taught every branch of the found- 
er's art, from the lOugh work of mixing and tempering clay for molds, 
and the maknig of crucibles, to the highest stages of designing and 
modeling objects in wax and of subsequently casting them in bronze. 
After long years of faithful work, if distinguished by special ability, 
he might be selected by his master as his successor, and at least was 
entitled to receive from him a modest sum of money, either as a loan 
or a gift, sufficient to enable liim to establish a small atelier of his own. 

The foundry of the artist always now forms jiart of his dwelling 
house, and doubtless this was the case in earlier times. Special rooms 
are set apart for drawing, modeling, and the preparation of the molds, 
the rougher operation of molding being carried on in sheds at the side 
of the garden or yard. The foundry itself, in which the metal is melted 
and cast, is also situated m the yard. A special feature in many is the 
well-arranged garden on which the modeling rooms open, so that the 
artist works amid cheerful surroundings, which must influence his work 
for good. The working staff consists of the artist, his apprentices, the 
members of his family, all of whom, even the children, assist in some of 
the operations, and one or two workmen. Castings from models designed 
by the artist himself form sometimes the sole work of the foundry, but 
generally other work is undertaken, and castings are then made of 
objects which have been modeled by other artists who send their molds 
ready prepared merely to be filled with metal. 

The Japanese processes of casting bronze and the appliances and 
materials used, which I shall now endeavor to describe, are those which 
I have seen from time to time in the art foundries of Osaka during 
my residence there, and I have to ask for your indulgence if I burden 
you with some dry and apparently trivial metallurgical details which 
maybe uninteresting to those who are not specially concerned with the 
melting of metals. I will, however, try to deal with them as briefly as 
possible. 

This part of my subject may be conveniently divided into the follow- 
ing sections: 

1. Preparation of the mold and core. In clay; in sand or loam. 

2. The furnace and foundry appliances. 

3. The operations of casting. 

4. The alloys used. 

5. Stains and patinas. 

1. -PREPARATION OF THE MOLD AND CORE (IN CLAY). 

The materials used for modeling and the preparation of the mold and 
core are as follows : Vegetable wax, prepared chiefly from the fruit of 
Rhus succedauea; it possesses great fluidity when melted, but has the 



THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAF. 629 

disadvantage of being extremely brittle in cold weather; beeswax; 
resin, obtained from various conifers, cliiefly Pinus massoniana and 
densiflora; clay, raw and burned; river sand; chopped rice straw; 
rice husks. Various mixtures of vegetable wax and resin, to which 
beeswax is sometimes added, also of beeswax and resin alone, are used 
for modeling, according to the character of the design of the object, and 
the extent and nature of its ornament. For castings of the highest 
class, and especially for those with delicate lines and forms or ornament, 
the latter mixtures are always employed, the former being used only for 
large or common works of simple shapes, with rough or little decora- 
tion. The clays used in Osaka and Kioto are obtained from the hills 
of decomposed granite in the neighborhood. They are extremely plastic, 
but are not very refractory, as they contain considerable amounts of the 
alkalies. 

Great care is devoted to their "tempering," which is effected by many 
months, even years, of exposure to the weather, with frequent turning 
over in the yard or sheds of the foundry. They are always mixed for 
use with varying proportions of old iire bricks in both fine and coarse 
powder, and wlien employed for large or solid cores with coarsely 
chopped rice straw, rice husks, and river sand. Special importance is 
attached to the use of the oldest clay for the preparation of molds and 
hollow cores, as it has been found by experience that they are then 
much stronger and less liable to crack than when made of newer mate- 
rial. The amount of rough usage these molds will bear without injury 
is very surprising. I have seen them rolled over the rough floor of the 
foundry from one end to the other and yet yield perfect castings. The 
core, which is one of the most important i)arts of the mold, possesses 
some curious features which are specially characteristic of Japanese 
foundry practice. For small figures it is generally solid, and these diifer 
but little from those in common use everywhere; in other cases it is 
always hollow. 

The hollow core — this is used by the Japanese wlienever possible — is 
of two kinds, in one of which it is closed at one end: in the other both 
ends are open. The chief pe(;uliarity of the former is its thinness, 
compared with similar cores in Europe, otherwise it does not differ 
much from them. I will hence only describe in detail the latter, or 
open core, as it has many peculiarities, and is i)articularly distinctive 
of the methods of founding adopted by artists. In its usual form 
its thickness is not much, sometimes not at all, greater than that of 
the outer shell of the mold; in fact, it merely forms its inner wall; 
and, in order that this kind of core may be employed almost all 
castings, even of vases, braziers, and similar objects, are cast without 
a bottom, the bottom being cast separately and subsequently attached 
by means of solder. It is usually fashioned on a wooden framework, 
the parts of which are ingeniously arranged, so that it can be with- 
drawn as soon as the entire mold has been finished and dried. This

framework, an example of which is shown in plan and section in fig. 2, 
is constructed as follows: A sufficient number of flat strips of wood, 

A A, resembling temi)lates, are 
prepared, their external edges 
being roughly cut to the shape 
of the interior of the article to 
be cast. Two circular disks of 
wood, B B, each in two seg- 
ments, and furnished Avith a 
central hole, are also prepared 
to form the top and bottom of 
the frame. The above strips 
are then arranged around the 
l^eripheries of the disks, and 
are kept in position by means 
of wires or cords. A bar of 
wood, C, of suitable length, is 
then x)assed through the aper- 
ture iu the disks, and the frame- 
work is firmly attached to it 
by wedges. The object of this 
bar is to enable the core to be 
moved about or revolved, and 
so to facilitate the work of the 
modeler. Thin strij)S of bam- 
boo, or sometimes a cord of 
straw, or both, are now bound 
rouiid the exterior of the frame. 
The core is then molded on it 
to the proper thickness with a 
mixture of burned and raw 
clay, and rice husks applied in 
several layers, the lower layers 
being coarser and more porous 
than those above them, and 
the exact form is given to it 
by one or two final coatings of 
clay mixed with sand. After 
the core has been dried the 
vase or other object is modeled 
on it in wax of the proper com- 
position (see above). Wooden 
or metal stamps are sometimes 
used for molding Chinese characters and parts of the ornament, but 
only for the commonest articles, the whole of the modeling of all others 
being performed by hand.

THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN, 631 

A drawing- or rougli model is sometimes used by the artist for liis 
guidanee, but not unfrequently lie works without either, and even wheu 
using them he does not merely copy their lines or the exact details of 
their ornament; in fact, often he departs from them altogether, if he 
feels that by a modification of their outlines or decoration the beauty 
of his subject may be increased. 

In preparing this model on the core he exerts his utmost skill ; no 
plaster casts are made from it; if the casting is a failure, liis work — it 
may have been a masterpiece — is lost, but if successful, it bears in 
imperishable bronze all the subtle and delicate touches of his hand. 
When the model is completed the ingates or openings C C C and 
D D D (fig. 7), through which the metal is i)oured into the mold, and 
the necessary outlets for the escape of the air and gases and for running 
out the wax, are molded on it, and in some objects pins of bronze are 
inserted in it to aid in keeping the core in position. The ingates for 
castings of moderate size, especially for those of considerable height, 
are not placed only at the top of the mold, but also in one or more tiers 
around its sides. Thus in fig. 7 we have four ingates (A A A A) a 
little above the middle, and three (B B B) on the top of the mold. The 
object in thus placing them being to diminish some of the disadvan- 
tages of the "descending" method of casting which have been pre- 
viously alluded to. For thin castings this practice is extremely 
successful, a much smaller proportion being defective from vesicular 
structure caused by entangled air, from burned i)atches. and from "cold 
sets," than when the ingates are all at the top. 

The wax model is now coated with a thin layer of line clay, applied 
with a brush with great care. After drying, other layers are similarly 
applied, until the crust is sufficiently thick to permit additional layers 
of somewhat coarser clays to be put on with the hand and tools, to give 
the requisite strength to the mold. The mixture of clays for the first 
layers is very carefully prepared, and is sometimes mixed with finely 
powdered porcelain, to prevent them from being melted by the molten 
metal. The formation of a fused crust on the casting, which Ls always 
difficult to remove, destroys its surface, and mars the sharpness of its 
designs, is. thus avoided. 

The mold is then dried very slowly in a warm part of the foundry. 
When dry, the wooden core is removed and the wax is then melted out 
by means of a carefully regulated charcoal fire, by which both the hol- 
low core and the outside of the mold are heated, and at the same time 
all traces of moisture are expelled and its walls baked hard. 

PREPARATION OF THE MOLD (IN SAND OR LOAM). 

Molding in sand or loam has not been extensively practiced by the 
Japanese for artistic castings, with the exception — as I have stated 
above — of fiat objects, such as coins and mirrors, and others of simple 
forms in which no parts bf the ornament are in undercut relief. Even 



632 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 

in many cases in wliicli the use of a sand or loam mold was jierfectly 
admissible, a clay mold seems to have been preferred because it could 
be heated before it was tilled with metal,, a point to which much 
importance is attached. Their methods of molding in sand do not 
differ greatly from ours; I will hence only describe that followed in the 
old mint about sixty years ago, where this kind of molding was 
brouglit to a high state of perfection for casting the bronze coins 
known as "tempo." 

Specimens of these coins and of mirrors cast in the same way are 
exhibited. 

The model, or "mother" coin as it was termed, was prepared in 
bronze, either by the "cera x)erduta" method or by cutting and engrav- 
ing. For mirrors and similar objects this or a model in wood was used 
as the "pattern," but for coins, when many bad to be cast, the "])at- 
terns" were prepared tirst by casting from tlie "mother" coin what were 
termed "seed" coins in pewter, and then from these the actual working 
"patterns" in bronze. 

Lantern slides were shown illustrating the operations of molding 
and casting in the old mint in Yeddo in 1835, as follows: 

Filling the mold frame with sand. 

Molding by means of the metal patterns. 

Smoking the molds. 

Pouring the bronze into the vertical sand molds, see PI. LXX, 

The "flask" or frame for holding the sand was of wood, without 
transverse or longitudinal ribs. It was placed on a flat board on the 
floor of the molding room, where it was tilled with damj) sand — the sand 
being well trodden to consolidate it — the excess was scraped ofl' and 
the surface made level and smooth. Upon this surface, which was 
first dusted with charcoal powder, two bronze rods to form the ingates 
and main feeding channels were i^laced, and on each side of them a 
row of the metal "patterns," all being carefully pressed into the .sand. 
Another frame was then placed upon it and filled with sand, which 
was also very carefully trodden. The frames were then separated, 
the "patterns" removed, and a small channel was cut from each cavity 
in the mold leading to the main channel. They were now placed on an 
open frame and their inner surfaces were smoked with burning pine 
wood held below them in a brazier. After being again fitted together 
they were placed between two boards and firndy braced up, and then set 
up vertically in the melting room to receive the bronze. 

2.— THE FURNACES AND APPLIANCES OF THE FOUNDRY. 

The furnaces and appliances which are used by Japanese artists for 
melting and casting bronze are of a very simple character. Tliey con- 
sist of a series of cupola furnaces in segments, several crucible fur- 
naces, and two kinds of blowing machines. 

Eeverberatory fuiuaces were not employed by the old founders, but

during recent years several have been erected from my designs in Gov 
erument and other establishments, chiefly, however, for the production 
of ordnance and castings for industrial purposes. 

When small castings only are required the bronze is generally melted 
in crucibles, but for those of larger dimensions a cupola furnace, or 
more than one, is always employed, 

A typical cupola furnace, which is that winch was actually used in 




Fig. 3.

the casting operations to be described subsequently, is represented in 
fig. 3. 

It is very ingeniously constructed of cylindrical segments. The 
lowest, which forms the hearth, consists of a cast-iron pan lined with 
fire clay and a coating of brasque, composed of clay and charcoal. It 
is furnished with an aperture, G, in front, for tapping out the metal, 
and another at the back for the insertion of the twyer, through which 



634 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 

tlie blast is introduced. Each of the other segments consists of a cyl- 
inder of fire bricks or slabs, cemented together with tire clay, and firmly 
bound with iron bands. The number and size of these segments used 
in erecting a cupola depends on the quantity of metal it is intended 
to melt at each charge, and as a considerable number of various sec- 
tions and degrees of taper are kept on hand, any form can be giveu 
to the interior of the cupola. In all well-arranged foundries these seg- 
ments, with their accompanying hearths of various sizes — generally 
from 1 foot to 2 feet 3 inches in diameter — are always ready, so that 
a furnace can be built up without delay at any time for either large 
or small meltings. 

The cupola is erected by placing the hearth segment on a platform of 
brick about 1 foot high, so that the tap hole may be of a convenient 
height for tapping. Upon this segment one of the others is placed and 
luted to it with fire clay; another is placed on this and similarly luted, 
and others are added if necessary until the furnace is of suitable 
height. The advantages which this method of erecting cupola furnaces 
possesses for small foundries, where the work is of an irregular char- 
acter, and where castings are often urgently needed which are too 
large for crucibles and too small to justify the lighting up of a large 
permanent cupalo, are self-evident. 

There is only one twyer, and this is the chief disadvantage of the 
larger sizes of these furnaces, as it causes an unequal distribution of 
heat in the zone of fusion, the results of which are undue volatilization 
of lead and zinc in the overheated spaces and an unnecessary waste of 
blast and fuel. There is no special charging door, the fuel and metal 
being sinq)ly thrown into the open top of the furnace. 

Portable furnace for melting bronze. — Another furnace which is not now 
in use in Japan, but is still employed in China, resembles the hearth 
segment of the cupola I have just described. It is, however, made light 
and portable, stands on three feet, and is fitted with sockets in its 
sides, into which long handles are inserted, so that it can be carried 
by two or four men. It is i^laced in front of a bellows, as shown, 
and then charged with charcoal and bronze. When sufficient of 
the latter has been melted it is carried to the mold, the fuel raked 
ofti, and the molten metal poured through a beak- shaped opening in 
its side. 

For objects of small size and complicated forms and of delicate model- 
ing the bronze is melted in crucibles in small furnaces, which, like the 
cupola, are worked by means of a blast. This form of furnace consists 
of a simple cylindrical chamber, with a lining of fire clay, generally 
partly embedded in the ground of the melting room, and fitted with a 
movable clay cover. Its sides are pierced with four or six. or more 
holes, about 3 to 5 inches above its base, for the admission of the blast. 
The fuel used is charcoal. Kecently air furnaces connected with cliim- 
ney stacks, similar to those of Europe, ha\'e been erected in many 



THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 635 

foundries, but tlie above form is still in extensive use in the melting 
rooms of artists. 

The crucible used (fig. 4) consists of a thin inner crucible of porcelain 
inclosed in an outer one of fire clay; aud its construction affords a good 
example of the ingenuity of the Japanese in overcoming the difficulties 
arising from the uourefractory character of their fire clay. As has been 
liointed out alreadj-, granitic clays, not very infusible, are alone avail- 
able for metallurgical i)urposes in Japan, j)orcelain clays being expen- 
sive and reserved for the potter. If the crucible were made entirely of 
the former it wOuld soften and crack at intense heats; hence it is lined 
with a cup of difficultly fusible porcelain just at that part where, 
owing to the position of the twyers, the temperature of the furnace is 
extremely high; so that, even if the outer part is partially fused or 
destroyed the metal will not be lost, but be retained by the porcelain 
cup within it. 

Blowing machines. — The machines used for producing the blast can not 
be passed over without notice. They are of two kinds, both of which 
are peculiar to the East, aud although defective in many respects when 
compared with the more perfect forms of blowers, 
such as Baker's and Root's, in use in this country 
and also in the large commercial aud Government 
works in Japan, yet their convenience and efficiency 
is sufficiently great to enable them to hold their own 
in the art foundries, where, indeed, they are still 
universally employed. One of these, called the 
"fuigo," is shown in the lantern slide. It is used for 
X)roducing the blast for the crucible furnace pre- ^.^ ^ 

viously described, and also very extensively for other crucible for melting 
metallurgical operations, such as copper, lead, and bronze. 

tin smelting. As the Chinese form, with which it is almost identical, 
has been described more than once, I will not trouble you with a 
detailed account of it. It is essentially a rectangular wooden box, fitted 
with a piston, which is worked horizontally, aud with four valves so 
arranged that it is double-acting, a blast being produced by both the 
forward and backward motion of the piston. The air chamber generally 
measures about 3 feet by 1 foot 10 inches by 7 inches. 

The other blowing machine, which is called "tatara," appears to have 
escaped the observation of foreign writers, as it has not hitherto been 
described. Fig. 5 represents it in plan aud sections. It consists of two 
air chambers A A, in some cases constructed of wood, in others of clay 
with merely a lining of wood at their sides. The bottom of each cham- 
ber is an inclined plane sloi^ing from a central ridge. The top of this 
ridge is fitted with metal bearings, in which the axle of the pressure 
board B works. The pressure board is made of wood and is fitted with 
two valves, C C, opening inwards, one being placed at each end. Its 
edges are sometimes lined with a packing of fur or feathers, so that it

may fit closely to tlie sides of tlie cliamber and leakage of air be pre- 
vented. 

About eiglit or ten persons are required for working one of these 
machines in melting bronze, and often the whole of the artist's house- 
hold — men, women, and children — aid in the operation. A rocking 
motion is given to the pressure board by the workers stepping alter- 
nately on and off either end (fig. C), and the air is thus compressed first 
in one chamber, then in the other, and passes to the blast outlet E

through a channel at the bottom and front of each. At tlie junction of 
these channels with the blast outlet a flap valve, D, closes either channel 
when the opposite half of the pressure board descends. The workers 
are aided in stepping on and off by ropes hanging from the roof, which 
they grasp with their hands, and in keeping time — and the efliciency of 
the machine depends greatly on this — by singing songs which have been 
specially composed for them. 

The blast is intermittent, irregular in pressure, and deficient in

volume ; and the effective power of a machine worked by eight men does 
not exceed 1 ton of cast iron melted per hour, the cost of the labor, 
however, being only about 8 pence. 

3.— THE OPERATIONS OF CASTING. 

The metal used for the charges of a cupola furnace when a " cast " 
has to be made consists either of old bronzes and defective castings, or 
more generally of a mixture of these with new alloy. The separate 
metallic constituents of the bronze, viz, copper, tin, lead, or zinc, do 
not forjn part of these charges, but the alloy is previously ])repared by 
melting them together some days beforehand. The alloy then obtained 
is cast into thin plates, which are broken up while hot, and the frag-

ments are used for the casting cliarges. When crucibles are used, the 
alloy is however frequently made at the time of casting, although for 
castings of special importance bronze which has already been once or 
oftener cast is always preferred. 

For my description of the operations of casting I have selected the 
casting of a brazier in the mold shown in fig. 7, as it is a typical exam- 
ple of Japanese practice, and I was present in the foundry during the 
whole of the ojjerations. 

The bronze was melted in the cupola furnace (fig. 3). Charcoal was 
used as fuel, and the blast was produced by a " tatara" worked by eight 
persons. 



638 



THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 



From an early hour iu the morning and while the melting was pro- 
ceeding the foundry stafit' was engaged in preparing the molds for the 
recei)tiou of the metal by heating them to redness. This was eifected 
in tlie following manner: The mold (fig. 7) was placed on five or six 
bricks, H H, to raise it above the earthen fioor of the melting room. 
Its ingates, COCO and D D D D, were closed with stoppers of 
clay and the conical tubes, F F, were fitted over its air outlets, E E, 
to prevent any fuel from falling into them. A wall of fire-clay slabs, 
G G, was now built up around it, the slabs being kei^t iu position by 
hoops and bands of iron and an exteriud luting of clay, a space about 
3 inches wide at its narrowest part being left between the inside of 
the wall and the outside of the mold. A charcoal fire was then made 

on the floor below the mold, 
and the space between the 
wall and the mold was com- 
pletely filled with burning 
charcoal, which was mixed 
with fragments of bricks 
and crucibles to prevent the 
heat from becoming too in- 
tense. The interior of the 
core was also partly filled 
with the same mixture, and 
two clay tubes were fitted 
above it to serve the pur- 
pose of chimneys. The tem- 
perature of the interior was 
regulated by i)artially or 
entirely closing the upper 
openings of these tubes 
with tiles. The mold was 
kept at a red heat for more 
than two hours, by which 
time the metal was nearly ready. The wall of clay slabs and the 
draft tubes were now rapidly taken down and the fire was raked 
away. The bricks 11 H, supporting the mold, were carefully removed, 
and the holes through which the wax had run out stopped up with fire 
clay. During their removal the floor below was sprinkled with water 
and softened by shoveling, and on this the mold was allowed to rest. 
Large stones were now piled around its base to steady it and the stop- 
pers were removed from the ingates. The ingates, of which there 
were seven — four about the middle of the mold and three at the top — 
were fashioned in the form of small cups of fire clay about 2 inches in 
diameter, each having three apertures, half inch in diameter, opening 
into the channel leading into the mold. 

The mold was now ready for receiving the metal. On looking into it

throagli one of the ingates it was seen to be a dull red heat. The 
bronze was then tapped intofoar iron ladles, each of which was held by 
a workman, and a small quiintity of Avood ashes was thrown upon its 
surface. The workmen then took up their positions opi)osite the lower 
iugatesand on a signal being given poured the contents of their ladles 
simultaneously into the mold. The quautity of metal had been very 
accurately estimated, as it just reached gbout half way up each ingate. 
These ingates were then closed with clay stoppers luted in with fire- 
clay. Three of the ladles were filled again and poured in the same man- 
ner as before, but into the upper ingates, completly filling the mold. 
During i)ouring very finely powdered rice bran was thinly sprinkled on 
the metal as it flowed from the mouths of the ladles. The mold was 
allowed to stand for six hours before breaking it from off the casting. 
Several other smaller molds were then filled in a similar manner, and as 
one ladleful of metal was sufficient to fill each, they had only one ingate 
and one air outlet. While the bronze was being poured into them 
they were rather vigorously tapped with a short stick to dislodge any 
air bubbles which might have adhered to their sides. 

For castings of very large size ladles are not used, but the bronze 
is run from one or more of cupola furnaces, first into a receptacle 
lined with fire clay, and then from this through an aperture in its 
bottom into the mold. The outflow is regulated by means of a plug, so 
that a considerable depth of metal is always retained in the receptacle 
in order that scoriiie and oxidized scums may be prevented from enter- 
ing the mold. To prevent oxidation as far as possible, the surface of 
the metal is kei)t carefully covered with a layer of charcoal or of jiar- 
tially carbonized straw. 

A subsidiary but often necessary part of the founder's work, and 
one in which the Japanese exhibit very great skill, is the repairing of 
any defects that the castings may show on their removal from the 
molds. Thus, for example, occasionally the rim or other part of a vase 
may be imperfect owing to the retention of air in the mold when the 
metal was poured in. In this case the imperfect part is carefully 
remodeled in wax on the defective casting, a clay mold is made over it 
in the usual way, and the wax is melted out. A certain quantity of 
metal is then j^oured in and allowed to run out until the edges of the 
defective part have been partially melted, when the outlet is stopped 
and the mold allowed to fill. When it has solidified the clay mold is 
broken away and the excess of metal filed off". 

Handles and ornamental appendages, which have been separately 
cast, are frequently attached to objects in this manner. Separate 
parts of complicated groups and of colossal figures are similarly united, 
and often this is so skillfully done that it is impossible to say whether 
the whole is a true single casting or is composed of several pieces which 
have been separately cast. 

Eude as the appliances and methods of the Japanese art founder 



640 THE ART OP CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 

which I have just described may seem to us, he has produced with 
them castings iu brouze ou all scales which, with all the modern equip- 
meuts of our foundries, it would be ditticult for us to excel. The sim- 
plicity, adaptability, and portable character of his appliances have 
been of special advantage to him in his remarkable achievements in 
colossal castings. Thus, when a huge image of a Buddhist divinity or 
a bell of unusual weight was \ equired for a temple in any locality, the 
whole of the operations were conducted on the spot. Temporary sheds 
for the modeling were erected in the temple grounds. The furnace and 
blowers were transported thither in segments; sometimes the latter 
were even made by the local carpenters. If the casting had to be made 
in one piece the necessary number of cupola furnaces, each with its 
blower, were erected around the mold. The cost of the blast was nil, 
as the services of any number of eager volunteers from the crowds 
which congregated at the temple festival on the day of casting were 
readily obtained for the meritorious work of treading the blowing 
machines. In this way the great bells and colossal images were cast. 
It may be interesting to note here that the methods of heating the 
mold and of repairing defective castings were in use in Europe during 
the tenth and eleventh centuries, and doubtless at a very much earlier 
date. They are described by Tl)eoi)hilus in his valuable treatise, I)e 
Diversis Artibus, written in the early half of the eleventh century, 
and his description is practically identical with that I have just given 
you of them as they are jiracticed in Japan. 

4.— THE ALLOYS USED. 

The success which the Japanese artist has attained in the execution 
of his famous masterpieces in bronze is not, however, solely due to his 
methods of modeling and casting, but is largely dependent on the 
physical character of the alloys he has used. His alloy, par excellence, 
is called "karakaue" — which signities "Chinese metal" — this name 
having been given to it because it is believed not to have originated in 
Japan, but to have been introduced from China. The exact date of its 
introduction is unknown, but there is little doubt that it was not later 
than the seventh century, when the bronze coins in circulation in the 
country were chiefly Chinese, and it was probably in this form that the 
Japanese first became acquainted with it. The name '' karakane" does 
not, however, designate any definite alloy. It has a generic rather 
than a specific signification, and is applied to a very varied group of 
mixtures of metals of the copper- tin-lead series, in which the propor- 
tion of copper may range from 71 to 80 j)er cent, of tin from 2 to 8 per 
cent, and of lead from 5 to 15 per cent. 

The Table II which follows contains all the analyses of the alloys 
bearing this name which have been published by various analysts, as 
well as some which I have made myself of typical specimens. It also 
includes several other allied alloys which are not in such general use as 
" karakane," but are valuable for special purposes:

THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 



643 



And as a comparison of the alloy "karakaue" with similar alloys of 
other countries is of considerable metallurgical as well as historical 
interest, I have given in Table III some analyses of several ancient 
objects, which will enable tin's comparison to be made. 

I would also call your attention to a very valuable series of analyses 
of oriental art metal work made under the direction of our chairman, 
Professor Roberts-Austen, who has won special distinction for his 
researches on alloys, and published by the science and art department. 

It will be seen from Table II that the presence of lead, as an impor- 
tant constituent, is one of the characteristic features of the composi- 
tion of the Japanese bronze " karakane," although, as is shown in 
Table III, it is not peculiar to them. Several reasons have been 
advanced for the origin of the iiresence of this metal in copi)er-tin 
alloys 5 those, however, we need not divscuss here. One thing is cer- 
tain, that even in very early times the relative properties of copper- 
tin and copper-tin-lead alloys were known, as in almost all specimens 
which have been analyzed swords and weapons in which strength and 
hardness were essential consist of the former (copper-tin), and coins, 
decorative objects, and figures, in which these properties were not 
necessary, of the latter (copper-tin-lead). 

The wide range in the proportions of the constituents of "karakane" 
is fully demonstrated by the analyses given above. This variability 
in composition is not solely the result of attempts on the part of the 
founder to produce si>ecial alloys, as might be conjectured, but is chiefly 
owing to the practice, universally adopted, of mixing considerable 
quantities of old metal "scrap" of unknown composition with the 
furnace charge, even when the copper, lead, and tin of the same charge 
have been carefully weighed in definite proportions, a practice not alto- 
gether unknown in this country. In the case of the temple bronzes, it 
is generally due to their having been cast from accunuilations of ex 
voto offerings of the most heterogeneous character. 

A few words on the purity of the metals used by the Japanese in pre- 
paring their alloys may not be out of place here. The copper, as will be 
seen from the following analyses, is almost without exception extremely 
free from the injurious metals — arsenic, antimony, and bisnuith: 

Japanese copper refined by native processes.

644 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 

Imperfectly refined copper, containing larger proportions of sulphur 
and iron than those given above but still comparatively free from 
arsenic, antimony, and bismuth, is sometimes used. When Japanese 
castings are unsound from vesicular cavities, the unsoundness is gen- 
erally due to the sulphur in such copper. The sulphur becomes oxi- 
dized, during melting and pouring the alloy, to gaseous sulphurous 
anhydride, and the cavities are formed by bubbles of this gas being 
retained in the casting during solidification. In our own foundries 
this element is also too frequently the unsuspected cause of the same 
defects in castings. 

The tin used generally contains lead, occasionally iron and copi)er, 
but rarely other impurities. 

The lead is tolerably pure, excej)ting that it always contains a little 
silver. 

Zinc, which is of frequent occurrence in Japanese bronzes (karakane), 
has never been added as metal, and its presence is due to the brass 
articles which often form part of the "scrap" of the furnace charges. 

The presence of arsenic and antimony, both of which are often found 
in considerable amounts in these alloys, is not due to the use of 
impure metals, but to the addition of a i)seudospeise called " shiro-me" — 
a by-product of the desilverization of copper by lead ' — the composition 
of which is given in the following analysis, which I have made of a char- 
acteristic specimen : 

Shiroine. 

Copper 72. 70 

Lead 8. 53 

Arsenic 11. 37 

Antimony 4. 27 

Tin 93 

Iron 13 99.50 

The first official record we have of the use of this pseudospeise is con- 
tained in an edict of the Government in 1761, prescribing its addition 
to the copper-tin -lead bronze to be used in the mints for the casting of 
coins, but doubtless it had been similarly employed very much earlier 
than that date, and almost certainly in the casting of the colossal 
Buddha in Kioto in 1614 A. D. It was added to tlie alloy in order to 
increase its hardness without diminishing its fusibility, and to obtain 
in the castings a sharper impression of the mold than was possible with 
the copper-tin-lead alloy alone. During later years it has been used by 
some bronze founders because its addition to "karakane" has been 
found to facilitate the jiroduction of the gray patina, which is preferred 
for objects which have to be decorated with inlaid-line designs in silver. 

It is almost needless to say that silver, although mentioned in temple 
records as having been added to the bronze used for the casting of some 
of their famous images and bells, has never been so added, as there is 
never more present than can be accounted for by its occurrence in the 



Shirome.

copper, lead, or shirome used. Mercury and gold, wliich are also erro- 
neously recorded as constituents of some noted bronzes, do not exist 
in the alloy, and can onlj^ liave been used for gilding their surfaces. 
Patches of gold have, however, been employed for the decoration of 
some ancient bronzes. 

The chief characters on which the value of the Japanese copper-tiu- 
lead alloys as art bronzes depend may be briefly stated as follows : 

(1) Low melting point. This is of especial importance to the Jajia- 
uese founder owing to tJie fusible nature of the clays and sands of 
which his crucibles and molds are made. 

(2) Great fluidity when melted compared with the sluggishness of 
copper-tin bronzes. 

(3) Capability of receiving sharp impressions of the mold. 

(4) Their contraction on solidification is not excessive. 

(5) Their peculiar smooth surface. 

(6) The readiness with which they acquire rich patinas of many tints 
when suitably treated. 

The advantages resulting from the above properties will be obvious 
to all artists in bronze. They are chiefly the result of the use of lead 
as one of the chief constituents of the alloys. The low melting point 
of these bronzes, their fluidity when melted, and the facility with which 
they acquire certain patinas are indeed entirely due to the use of this 
metal. The fine velvety surface and sharpness of the castings depend 
in a great measure on the structure of the mold and its comparative 
high temperature when the bronze is poured into it, although partly 
also on the influence of the lead. These alloys are, however, not with- 
out some disadvantageous physical properties, and these are also due 
to the lead which they contain. They are often low in tenacity, and 
offer but little resistance to bending and torsien when compared with 
simple copper-tin bronzes, even when they contain sufflcient tin to 
enable them to hold more lead in solution than they would otherwise 
do. Their use is hence almost limited to the production of objects of 
art. And even for those art castings, such as, for example, large 
equestriau or other statues, where a considerable strain has to be borne 
by certain parts, their use is unadvisable. But in most art castings of 
moderate size — and even in many of colossal proportions, where the 
position of the center of gravity of the mass does not cause excessive 
tension in any part — it is not necessary that the metal of which they 
are cast should possess great tenacity. For all such these alloys are 
eminently adapted, and especially so, as by no others can the work of 
the artist's hand, with all its delicate and masterly touches, be so 
readily and perfectly reproduced. 

1 do not think they could be advantageously used for statues or 
monuments exposed to tbe weather in the impure atmosphere of our 
great towns, but for castings protected from these combined adverse 
influences I think the Japanese bronze, "karakene," is worthy of a 
trial. As we have seen, the Japanese founders have no fixed or stand-

ard composition for tlieir alloy. I may hence be permitted to suggest 
the proportions iu which, in my opinion, the metals should be mixed to 
produce a bronze which, for castings of moderate size and thickness, 
would secure many of the advantages possessed by it. They are as 
follows :

The zinc to be omitted from castings with very delicate lines of ornament. 

Specimens of each of these alloys are on the table for your inspec- 
tion, also a specimen of ordinary gun metal, C, containing 2 jier cent of 
zinc, for comparison with them. They do not differ much in tensile 
strength, that of A being 13.25 tons, of B 12.19 tons, and of C 14.29 
tons per square inch. These alloys have been kindly prepared for me, 
and their tensile strengths determined by the Broughton Copper Com- 
pany (Manchester), who are specially skilled in the manufacture of 
copper alloys. 

. The other alloys, which are not contained in the " karakane " group, 
do not require a lengthy consideration, as they are much less fre- 
quently made use of by artists. Thus the simj)le copper-tin alloys 
which were employed in prehistoric times are not found in use after 
the introduction of '' karakane" from China until comparatively 
recently, and then only occasionally for mirrors. 

Neither have the copper-zinc alloys, " Shinchu," or brass (Table II, 
Nos. 24 and 25), been much iu favor among artists. They were 
unknown in Japan before the establishment of Buddhism, and were 
probably introduced contemporaneously with that religion from China 
(sixth century A. C). Their use iu art has been almost exclusively 
restricted to the production of the ceremonial vessels and utensils of 
temples and shrines, and especially for the " Go-gusoku," or five orna- 
ments of the Buddhist altar. 

Even when a yellow metal is needed for the purposes of decorative 
ornament brass is seldom used, copper coated with gold being jireferred, 
the rich color and quality of the gold surface being more pleasing to 
the Japanese than the harsher tones of the copper-zinc alloy. Hence 
there is scarcely a single example in the country of any great work of 
art executed in brass. 

Occasionally the yellow bronze, " sentoku" (Table II, No. 26), con- 
sisting of copper, tin, and zinc — an alloy occupying an intermediate 
position between "karakane" and brass — is used instead of the latter 
alloy. It is, however, probably not older than the fifteenth century. 
An old Chinese legend records that it was accidentally discovered after 



THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 647 

the destruction of a temple by fire, when the bronze, brass, and gokl 
vessels of the altar were melted together into a mass. The beautiful 
color of the metal attracted the attention of some art founders, who, 
after numerous unsuccessful attempts, at last succeeded in producing 
an alloy resembling- it. . Gold is said to be an essential ingredient in its 
composition, but I have not found any in the specimens I have exam- 
ined. It is not in very common use. Vases and otlier objects cast of 
it — generally with but little ornament in relief — are occasionally met 
with, but the finest specimens are found among the guards and other 
ornamental furniture of the sword, and all are chiefly notable as exam- 
ples of chasing rather than of founding, or for the beautiful color and 
texture of their surfaces. 

The method of preparing or melting bronze is, as is well l^nown to 
all founders, secondary only to its correct comijosition, and as it has 
such an important influence on the character of the castings, one or 
two points relating to it, derived from my own experience, may be 
briefly considered here. Cupola furnaces should never be used for any 
bronze castings. If coke is employed as fuel in them the metal will be 
contaminated with sulphurous anhydride (SO^), and the casting will 
be vesicular. This may be avoided by using charcoal, but with either 
fuel the bronze will be of uncertain composition. The Japanese method 
is in this respect decidedly faulty. 

For castings of small or moderate size the bronze should be melted 
in plumbago crucibles. For large castings requiring the contents of 
several crucibles a vessel of sufficient capacity should be provided into 
which the metal from all the crucibles should be i)oured, and then from 
it into the mold. 

The bronze should not be stirred with iron rods, or it will be con- 
taminated with iron, but with plumbago stirrers. This method should 
be adopted whenever practicable, even for castings of considerable size, 
and the fuel used should be charcoal or specially selected coke as free 
as possible from sulphur. 

For colossal castings reverberatory furnaces must be used, and when 
worked with care they give satisfactory results. A point apt to be 
neglected in these furnaces is the proper mixing of the alloy — not a 
diiflcult matter, but requiring more supervision than is often given to 
jt — and everyone who has had to make many castings with them will 
have occasionally found crusts of a white alloy attached to the sides of 
the hearth, indicating that some of the castings did not contain their 
full amount of tin. 

A second point of importance which is often overlooked is the liabil- 
ity of the metal to absorb sulphurous anhydride (SO2) from the prod- 
ucts of combustion of the fuel. This may be prevented by keeping a 
sufficient supply of charcoal on the melting hearth while the copper is 
being melted, and afterwards a thick layer on its surface, and at the 
same time guarding against a large accumulation of ashes and clinker 
in the fireplace. ■ ^ 



648 THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 

Another important point is the prevention of the formation of sub- 
oxide of <'0j)per (Cn/)) during- the nieltiuii' of the copper before the 
addition of the tin and other metals, as, wlienever this is formed, it dis- 
solves in the copper, and when the tin and zinc are added it reacts with 
them, forming difficultly fusible oxides, which diminish very greatly the 
fluidity of the bronze.' 

It is prevented, to a certain extent, by keeping an excess of charcoal 
on the melting hearth, but too often this is an insufficient precantion, 
and I would strongly recommend in all cases that the copper should be 
treated by the process known as "poling" before the addition of the 
tin and other metals. This is performed by placing the end of a pole 
of green wood below the surface of the copper; much gas and vapor 
are given off, the metal is violently agitated, so that every partic^le is 
brought into contact with the charcoal on its surface, and all traces of 
suboxide are removed. 

Phosphorus, aluminium, and manganese have each the effect of 
removing this oxide. They should not, however, be added in excess, 
but only in sufficient quantities to insure this result. The kind of cop- 
per used is also of great importance. 

The purest metal obtainable should alone be employed in the prepa- 
ration of bronze for valuable "cera perduta" castings, electro-deposited 
copper if possible, or at least Avhat is known as "best selected" copper, 
and this should have an electric conductivity of not less than 98 per 
cent on Matthiessen's scale. 

5.— STAINS AND PATINAS. 

The rich patinas which Japanese bronzes acquire by age or special 
treatment, and which enhance so much the beauty of the artists' work, 
are worthy of a brief consideration, although perhaps they do not 
strictly come within the scope of the title of this paper. In many bronzes 
the beautiful color is due merely to a "stain," i. e., a colored film of 
infinitesimal thinness. In others the surface of the metal is altered to a 
considerable depth, and in these only have we true patinas. Frequently 
both a " stain " and a patina are produced by similar treatment, but the 
operations required for the latter are of a more jirolonged character than 
for the former, and are accompanied by s|>ecial nmnipulations, in addi 
tion to the apiilication of what are termed pickling solutions. For the 
production of true patinas of the richest and darkest shades of brown 
by Japanese methods it is essential that lead should form one of the 
constituents of the bronze, and that zinc should either be absent alto- 
gether or be present only in small proportions. On the other hand, 
"stains" of any color can be given to metal of any eom])Osition and 
even to unalloyed copper. 

The substances used in the operations are copper sulphate, basic 



'This can be easily demonstrated by melting a little cojiper iu a crucible, allowing 
it to oxidize, and then adding zinc, when the resulting alloy will be found to be so 
pasty that it can hardly be poured out of the crucible.

acetates of copper (verdigris), iron sulphate, snlpliui- in fine powder, 
alum, vinegar prepared from unripe plums, and a decoction of the roots 
or entire plant of Calamagrostis halconensis (Kat. Ord. Grcuninca'), 
potassium nitrate, and sodium chloride. The most important of these 
reagents are the flrst five in the above enumeration. Various mixtures 
of these are dissolved or suspended in j)lum vinegar and water to form 
what are called the pickling solutions. Sometimes they are api^lied in 
the form of pastes. Some are also used singly to obtain special effects, 
especially the decoction of Galamagrostis. The proportions in which 
they are mixed to form the pickling solutions are different in every art 
foundry, even for the same patina. Hence several recipes — said to be 
used for special patinas — which have been communicated to foreigners, 
and in which these proportions are given in very exact weights, are not 
strictly representative of actual practice. So far as my observations 
go, the ingredients are never carefully weighed in making a solution, 
and when it is made additional quantities are so often mixed with it at 
the discretion of the craftsman, that after the flrst day of its use it is 
impossible to say what its composition really is. Old solutions are 
always preferred to new, and in many cases are added to the new in 
large quantities, thus still further increasing the indeflniteness of their 
comi)osition. In the bronze department of the imperial mint, which 
was superintended by an old art worker of great skill, there was only 
one pickling solution for the treatment of bronze. About equal parts 
of copper and iron sulphates and smaller quantities of alum and sul- 
phur mixed with varying quantities of plum vinegar, water, and old 
solution were used in its preperation. Almost every variety of stains 
and patinas, excepting red and green, were obtained by its use by 
varying the mode in which it was applied and the treatment of the 
bronze between the applications. 

The processes for producing a patina by the use of these solutions 
are, as might be expected from what I have just stated, neither simple 
nor easy, and the intermediate operations on which its production 
depends, more than on the exact composition of the solution, are so 
variously modified in different foundries that I can only give you an 
imperfect account of their chief features within the limits of this 
liaper. 

When the casting has been freed from any adherent portion of the 
mold its surface, where necessary, is very carefully smoothed by lightly 
rubbing it with a piece of soft, close-grained charcoal or with an 
impalpable powder of silicious shale i^repared by levigation. After its 
surface has been thus prepared it is sometimes boiled in a decoction of 
finely ground beans {Glycine hispida), this treatment being supposed to 
facilitate the action of the pickling solution. 

It is then immersed in the pickling solution, which is frequently 
heated almost or quite to the boiling point, but sometimes to a much 
lower temperature. In other cases it is allowed to remain in a cold 
solution for many hours. After the casting has been acted on until the

required effect of this stage of the process has been obtained it is taken 
out aud washed with water, and also with a de(!Oction of Galamagrostis. 
It is then carefully heated over a brazier containing burning charcoal, 
being turned round from time to time until every j)art has been brought 
to the proper temperature. During this operation it is frequently 
wetted Avith the above decoction or with a i^ickling solution, and the 
amount of time and patience bestowed on this manipulation is almost 
incredible. The casting is again submitted to the action of the pickle, 
again heated as above described, and these operations are repeated 
until the desired platina has been produced. 

It is obvious that large bronzes can not be thus treated. The pick- 
ling solution can only be applied to them in washes, and their action 
is thus merely sufficient to produce a very thin film of altered metal, 
scarcely, if at all, more than a stain, and the true patina only results 
from the action of time. A green petina, in imitation of that of ancient 
bronzes which have been ex})osed to the action of the weather, is 
obtained by treating the casting with |)lum vinegar, to which common 
salt is occasionally added, and exposing it to the air, and sometimes this 
is supplemented by burial in the ground for varying lengths of time. 
This patina, although often very beautiful, is, I need hardly say, of an 
entirely different character from the mixture of carbonates, oxychlo- 
rides, and oxides of which the true old patina consists. 

It Avill be seen from the foregoing that much practice, careful observa- 
tion, and patient labor are required for the successful performance of 
these operations. The artist has no definite rules for his guidance in 
carrying them out, each seems to have his own methods of procedure, 
aud these he varies according to his ex])erience. His success does not 
depend on the use of solutions of definite composition, or on the exact 
proportions of the metals in his alloys, but rather on his ability to cor- 
rectly modify the manipulation of the various stages of the i^rocess, so 
that the patina he aims at may be infallibly produced. These are the 
chief features of what may be termed the "wet" method of producing 
patina. The oldest bronzes, however, owe their patinas almost exclu- 
sively to the action of time, and those of intermediate age generally to 
"dry" methods, in which they were exposed to carefully regulated 
temperatures in furnaces heated by charcoal. These "dry" methods 
have now been almost entirely displaced by the "wet" methods just 
described, and were not in use in the foundries in Osaka to which I 
had access, so that I have not seen them in operation. Several speci- 
mens of bronzes, with magnificent patinas, are exhibited from the col- 
lections of my friends, Mr. Alfred Cock, Mr. Swan, and Mr. Tomkinson. 

From the account I have just given you — I fear a very imperfect 
one — of the methods of casting bronze in Japan, it will be seen that 
they do not differ very greatly from ours. The chief differences lie in 
the use of the artist's model itself, in the preparation of the mold, 
in the heating of the mold, and the composition of the bronze. AH 
these we can imitate; but the special excellence of Japanese bronze 



THE ART OF CASTING BRONZE IN JAPAN. 651 

castings — the faithful reproduction of the wax model, the comparative 
absence of retouching, the delicacy and vigor of the relief decoration — 
are not due solely to these, but are tlie results of a combination of con- 
ditions which are only of exceptional occurrence here. Chief among 
these is the nature of the Japanese people, the intense feeimg and love 
of art with which they have been imbued for centuries past, and their 
just and enthusiastic appreciation of faithfulness in work. These qual- 
ities have made every workman an artist, hence tlie patient and mar- 
velous skill which we see displayed in all his work, as well on common 
articles for everyday use as on those for the special purpose of decora- 
tion. The training which the artist receives in the operations of found- 
ing is also an important factor Avhicli can not be overlooked. Besides 
these there is an esprit de corps in the staff of a Japanese art foundry, 
which is not always found in Europe, the outcome of which is that an 
amount of painstaking care almost incredible is exercised by all, so 
that the work shall be as perfect as they can make it and worthy of 
the renown of their master. 

One word only in conclusion. I think it will be admitted by all that 
a sculptor should himself i)Ossess a practical knowledge of the technical 
processes by which his work is to be reproduced in bronze. Now in 
this country this knowledge can only be acquired with the greatest dif- 
ficulty by our artists, as it does not form a part of any course of their 
art training. I would hence repeat and indorse, with the emphasis it 
deserves, the suggestion made by Mr. Simonds in a valuable paper on 
"Artistic bronze casting," read before this society nine years ago, 'Hhat 
studios should be established in connection with our national art schools, 
where the student of sculpture could be i)ractically taught the various 
processes incidental to his profession of molding and bronze casting," 
and, I would add, the coloring of metals. It would seem to be a matter 
in the encouragement and development of which our society might be 
able to aftbrd valuable aid. There should be no insuperable difficulties 
in carrying it out, and I am sure you will agree with me that if it were 
carried out it could not fail to be of inestimable value to our artists, 
and to promote in no small degree the advancement of the art of bronze 
founding in our country. 

The magnificent bronzes which I have the jirivilege of exhibiting to 
you tonight are chiefly from the collections of my friends, Prof. W. 
Anderson, Messrs. W, Cleverly Alexander, Alfred Cock, E. Dillon, F. 
Dillon, W. E. Hennell, Sir Trevor Lawrence, Messrs. E. Mills, Alfred 
Parsons, Charles H. Eead, F. A. Satow, W. Harding Smith, E. Phene 
Spiers, J. M. Swan, H. V. Tebbs, and M. Tomkinson, to all of whom I 
desire here to express my sincere thanks for having so kindly lent them 
for the illustration of my paper, and especially so as I feel that any 
interest it may have had is largely due to them. I also owe many 
thanks to M. Cernuschi for his kindness in permitting me to have pho- 
tographs taken of the fine specimens in his unique collection, which I 
have shown you on the screen.

By Rudolph Virchow. 



Our university, since its tbuiidation eighty-two years ago, has been 
in the habit of celebrating- the beginning- of its scholastic year with par- 
ticularly solemn feelings. Among the festivals it observes, this Octo 
ber day above all invites self-scrutiny, a review of past successes, an 
examination of the methods pursued, and, on the other hand, a consid- 
eration of new problems, a survey of the future. Have we proved our- 
selves able to perform the tasks devolving upon us ? Have we used to 
good purpose our means for the training of youth to fulfill the highest 
aims of the state and of humanity? Do we enjoy the consciousness 
that the hopes have been realized which our activity aroused in our- 
selves and in our country? 

Upon the new rector rests the heavy responsibility of interpreting 
these and similar reflections. But who has the eloquence to sum up in 
a general statement all the widely diverging ideas of his colleagues? 
How few succeed in gaining- eveit a superficial view of the changes 
unceasingly taking place in the sciences ! Not one of us, we frankly 
confess, is an authority on all branches of human knowledge; not one 
can do more than judge the course of studies at the university from 
the iwint of view of his specialty, his individual experience. The temp- 
tation thus assails the speaker to discuss the branch to which he has 
devoted himself rather than study in general. I shall endeavor to steer 
clear of this danger. Forty-six years ago I became a member of this 
faculty in the capacity of prixatdocent; for forty- three years I have been 
ordinarius in an out-of-town university and here, and now the confi- 
dence of my colleagues has honored me with this high post. In the 
interval great changes, greater than those of centuries before, have 
taken place in science as well as in political life. All dei)artments of 
human endeavor have been remodeled, some undergoing radical trans 
formation, others being subjected to incisive criticism. Who that has 
been interested in jiublic life can have failed to note and seriously con- 
sider these great happenings? University life is surely not an isolated 
phenomenon amid the spiritual experiences of the nations. We uui 
versify teachers are forced to keep constant watch upon all departments

of education, upon the elementary and secondaiy schools, which are to 
supply us with zealous young knowledge-seekers, and no less upon the 
instruction dispensed at the higher schools, especially tbe technical 
institutions, many of which have latterly manifested the laudable ambi- 
tion to be, or at least to be called, high schools (Hochschulen). For the 
X)rimary establishments the university is a constant warning to equij) 
their wards so thoroughly that they may take in our instrnction with 
full understanding; for the higher institutions, it is a model by which 
to fashion their methods and expedients. On the other hand, the uni- 
versity has the duty to fnrnish the state and society with generation 
after generation of well-trained young men permeated with systematic 
knowledge, governed by high moral views, keeping alive the sacred 
torch of science, and bearing it aloft through all the i)erplexities and 
darkness of daily life. 

Time was when not only this exalted position of the universities was 
generally recognized, but when they were distinguished by great priv- 
ileges, many of which are now lost. We have passed tlie period — a 
fortunate even if not a permanent condition — when universities were 
exposed to violent attacks, and most irksome restrictions of their lib- 
erty were demanded. But we will not forget that this university, too, 
established in sad days to be in the words of its founder, Frederick 
William III, " a nursery of better times," fell under suspicion, and was 
subjected to rigid surveillance. Various reasons combined to produce 
so sad a condition of affairs. One of them, and I beg that you, my 
dear students, give it your special attention, arose out of the attitude 
of many students, and was due to the widespread misconception with 
regard to the objects of study and the position of the students. 

No less a man than Johann Gottlieb Fichte was the first to give 
expression to this thought on an occasion similar to the present one. 
In his memorable address "on the only possible interference with aca- 
demic liberty," delivered on October 19, 1811, when he assumed his duties 
as the first rector of our university, he said, "Only he that studies is a 
student;" a severe dictum, but worthy of consideration. With pro- 
Ijhetic insight he describes the consequences when students, instead of 
considering study their chief task, "instead of concentrating all their 
thinking and planning upon their chosen science," spend their time in 
cherishing obsolete traditions connected with a separate, privileged 
student class, and in keeping up supposed prerogatives. Let it suffice 
to refer to this address, which every student may profitably read. Fichte 
was careful to point out that he was not speaking of conditions preva- 
lent at our university, but that he had in mind the "state of affairs at 
other universities," and the serious tone of his admonition plainly dis- 
closes his opinion of the gravity of the danger, so threatening, indeed, 
Jthat he considered it the "only possible interference with academic 
liberty. " 

The serious crisis which occurred a few years later, overwhelming all 



STUDY AND RESEARCH. 655 

the German universities, mention of which recalls the Carlsbad Eesolu- 
tions, has at last vanished, and we realize with gratitude that it has 
left us in undiminished enjoyment of our most precious possessions — 
liberty of instruction and liberty of study (Lehrfreiheit und Lernfrei- 
heit), possessions in which we have abundant reason to take pride when 
we compare our own with other European nations. Teachers and 
students have lost none of that independence and self-dependence 
which grow out of the feeling of responsibility, and are incomiiatible 
with control from without. In particular, liberty of instruction, granted 
as a special privilege by emperors and rulers up to the dissolution of 
the German Empire, has become a constitutional right in our time. 
Moreover, we retain the privilege of choosing our rector through our 
professors (ordentliche Professoren), and the corporate character of the 
university has not been called into question before the law. 

To be sure many other privileges, originating when the body of 
students was well nigh sovereign and medieval customs determined 
the conditions of student life, have vanished wholly. Even academic 
jurisdiction, with the exception of a certain degree of disciplinary 
competence, has been abolished; our scepters, which appear on occa- 
sions like this, are ornaments rather than the insignia of power. The 
student is wholly amenable to civil law; he is a citizen, like those in 
other walks of life, and it behooves him to know that he now enjoys no 
privilege but that granted him by reason of his preparatory education, 
namely, liberty of study, and that to be acquired by devotion to uni- 
versity studies, namely, eligibility to many, in fact tlie highest, positions 
in the gift of the state. For the rest, we no longer have any academic 
liberty that differs from ordinary civil liberty. The student has no 
peculiar legal code; the academic citizen, like every other citizen of 
the state, must look to the constitution as the source of law. But 
the constitution has granted him more rights than he possessed before, 
especially the right of occupying himself with politics within the 
limits set by the constitution and by law, and exemption fi'om the 
jurisdiction of special courts. 

Therefore, my dear students, receive my well-meant counsel to 
devote yourselves to study as your first and foremost task, with high 
seriousness and with the consciousness of all it involves. Self-evident 
as it may seem, experience teaches that this admonition can not be 
repeated too often or with too much emphasis. It applies not alone to 
the last terms at the university, but to the early ones as well. The 
more abstruse and comprehensive the science which the matriculate 
student chooses as his specialty, the earlier must methodical study 
begin; for the instruction of the later terms is intelligible only when 
based on that of the earlier. The temptation to enjoy academic liberty, 
first of all by neglect of study, is doubtless great with a young student. 
Stepping out from under the rigid discipline of the gymnasium into the 
golden sunlight of academic liberty, he feels sensuous delight in stretch- 



656 STUDY AND RESEARCH. 

ing Lis limbs aud acting iu au irresponsible, improvident way. We all 
know the feeling, and are in the habit of treating this use of academic 
liberty with " academic forbearance." But a limit must be set to for- 
bearance; for, in reality, academic liberty according to our interpre- 
tation and according to that of the state, is a very different aflair. 
"Academic liberty" is not "liberty to do nothing," not "liberty in the 
pursuit of pleasure or the indulgence of the passions," but "liberty of 
study." This is true academic liberty, to jjractice which the university 
is opened to students. 

Neither teachers nor students should forget that the aim of university 
work is high: general scientific and ethical culture and full mastery of 
some one branch of knowledge. At least once in his life, and that at 
the end of his university course, the attainments of a cultured young 
man ought to reach the tide mark of scientific research, particularly in 
his specialty. If he fails to gain that point then, there is little hope 
that he will ever take creditable rank with his scientific associates; he 
has the prospect of never being anything but a bungler. Let none 
deceive himself on this subject; only in exceptional cases does a period 
of study occur later in life equal in freedom to that normally granted 
the academic citizen. 

For the full exercise of this liberty of study the first condition is 
love of study. Indisposition to study and liberty of study are contra- 
dictory terms. The would-be university student is at once, on entering, 
forced to decide what aud how he will study. He who lacks desire to 
study will evade the issue. With such an one choice is not exercised as 
to the manner of studying; it wavers between studying and not study- 
ing. The university has no means of compelling study. The disci- 
plinary and regulative measures at its command are barely stringent 
enough to insure attendance at lectures; only the medical faculty pos- 
sesses in its examinations an institution calculated to enforce a certain 
degree of order in the sequence of lectures and exercises. But experi- 
ence teaches that, in the absence of love of study, even this regulation 
fails to x)roduce satisfactory results. How, then, can love of study be 
awakened ? 

At a great university like ours the j)ersoual influence of the teacher 
upon individual students is naturally very limited; only peculiar cir- 
cumstances make it possible for the teacher to come into close contact 
with a small circle of those he addresses or, in very exceptional cases, 
Avith single individuals. His influence, therefore, is exerted in the main 
upon the mass of his audience, and it is reserved for a late examination 
to reveal to him how superficially it has touched single members of his 
class. It is a pleasure to be able to state that the number of students 
who follow the lectures with delight and success, even distinguished 
success, is by no means small. But it were wrong to conceal the fact 
that too often the complaint escapes from the teacher that his efl^orts 
have been vain. Some, indeed, go a step further, aud maintain that 



STUDY AND RESEARCH. 657 

it is noticeable tbat from year to year the culture of students becomes 
less aud less wide. 

This is especially true in departments, as, for instance, jurisprudence 
aud medicine, which, besides being- wholly different from the studies 
pursued before entrance, are distinguished by an overwhelming- fuilness 
of uew ideas. Precisely iu these branches the attitude of the student 
during- the first few terms decides his development, indeed his whole 
future. In such studies each lecture grows logically out of the last, 
and the superstructure will be a labyrinth to him Avho is not acquainted 
with every cranny of the substructure. The result is an imperfect 
piece of work built up on an insecure foundation, and the later influence 
of the teacher avads naught to fill up the gaps. 

Doubtless the difficulty of the subjects taught contributes greatly to 
the abatement of zeal in the beginner. Yet it is precisely the beginner 
upon whose enthusiasm everything depends. Is it possible that the 
university teacher is to be held responsible for the diminution of ardor 
so often occurring- in the early terms ? Most rigid investigation will not 
substantiate the reproach, and, so far as I know, it has not been made, 
certainlj^ not with any degree of frequency. I should say that, on the 
contrary, all reflection upon the matter leads to the subject of prepara- 
tory work. 

This question at present engages the attention of many minds. Cul- 
tured men, aud no less the state, are occupied with the problem of the 
changes necessary in the instruction dispensed by the higher schools, 
in order to secure i^reparation for the university of the sort conducive 
to the best interests of its work. My address would have to transgress 
its limits by far, were I to attempt the discussion of this important 
problem in ail its phases. The disputants difi'er on the curriculum, on 
the amount of time to be assigned to each study, on the methods of 
teacliing, arriving finally at the overburdening- of pujjils, mayliai) also 
of teachers. The experience of the university teacher is wide enough 
to admit of his formulating- an opinion on the majority of these ques- 
tions; for to day's consideration, however, a few of the less hackneyed 
ones will sufiice. 

The university teacher must first of all make two closely connected 
demands upon the j)reparatory schools. He must require that the 
matriculates bring to the university delight in study and ability to do 
indei)endent work. As compared with these demands, the evidence of 
positive attainments sinks into the background. In the latter respect, 
each faculty sets up a different standard ; but with regard to the former 
there is probably no appreciable variation. 

As for delight iu learning, it is inborn in every normally gifted child. 
Daily we may observe the child's pleasure at becoming acquainted with 
some new object, or at learning- to use its organs in a new way. Its 
eagerness grows with every step iu advance. It is an innate quality, 
aud the use made thereof depends primarily ujjou the constitution of 
SM 94 42 



658 STUDY AND RESEARCH. 

the organs. Various differences in their actions crop out early, con- 
ditioned, as they are, by natural endowment and inherited peculiarities. 

Is it presumable that this quality is peculiar to children'? Surely 
not. It is distinctive of man in hoary age as well, so long as his organs 
are not in an abnormal condition, or external circumstances have not 
caused a disturbance or interruption. Eecall the joy of the scholar, 
bowed down under the weight of years, when a new outlook upon the 
domain of science is vouchsafed him. How his delight in study is 
stimulated when he succeeds in grasping a new series of phenomena, 
be it of nature or of the human mind, hitherto unintelligible or inac- 
cessible! How, then, were it possible to explain the absence of this 
common human quality in young men of culture about to join the ranks 
of academic citizenship 1 They certainly possess it, but not infrequently 
it has been stunted by injudicious treatment. Hence it is necessary 
not to create, but to reanimate it. 

Under careful training, delight in learning soon develops into desire 
for knowledge, which refuses to stop at mere acquaintance with a fact, 
and urges the student to seek its explanation. It casts about for the 
connection between phenomena and occurrences, for their causes and 
history, and rests satisfied only when it has discovered their genetic 
and causal relations. This is the characteristic sign of a genuine desire 
for knowledge, and it involves the beginning of research. Proneness 
to investigation is also manifested by children. They are in the habit 
of taking to pieces objects that fall under their observation, and they 
imitate movements to find out what must be done to i)roduce them. 
Education, then, finds all its elements ready at hand in child nature; 
it is merely necessary to bring them into play, and cultivate them along 
the right lines by concentrating the mind upon facts, keeping the 
interest actively engaged, confining work to the main xioint, and 
diverting the attention from objects of subordinate importance. 

We are justified now in i)ropounding the question: Is this done in 
our schools? In our very primary classes the child's delight in study 
is so materially curtailed that a considerable proportion of our people 
develops not legitimate curiosity, but its i^erverted form, inquisitive- 
ness, i. e., the inclination to rest satisfied with an external, therefore 
an incomplete, understanding of a subject, and to pass quickly from one 
subject to another. Thus a natural quality beneficent in its character 
is distorted and forced into forms of expression which, not rarely 
harmful, at best are useless. 

If the legitimate desire for knowledge is to be aroused in the child 
mind, that is, if it is to be trained up to a consideration of genetic and 
causal relations, its attention must be fixed upon historic facts. Even 
religious instruction, of all branches the one which depends upon 
almost verbal transmission of doctrines, does not confine itself to 
dogmatic precept, but uses sacred history as a means of illustration. 
Nothing, however, is so well adapted for that sort of instruction as 



STUDY AND RESEARCH. 659 

natural history so-called, which deals with tangible objects that furnish 
patent illustrations of genetic processes. Our public schools are mak- 
ing daily progress in the application of object lessons, aud the only 
desideratum now is that illustrations by pictures may gradually be 
sui3erseded by explanations from the object itself. 

In the higher schools linguistic studies have always absorbed the 
lion's share of time and attention. The gymnasium being the direct 
descendant of the Latin school of the Middle Ages, a. i^redilection for 
Latin has come down to it as an inalienable heritage. Greek, for whose 
introduction we are indebted to the humanists, took rank Avith it only 
later. We recognize with gratitude that this circumstance was accom- 
panied by the beneficent result of supplying civilized Europe with a 
common basis of culture for those nations participating in it — those 
called the Western peoples in Kussia. This common basis has con- 
tributed more than any other factor to the promotion of mutual under- 
standing and the strengthening of the sense of relationship. For a 
long time the universal use of Latin by scholars facilitated intercourse 
among all classes of people in different countries. 

All that has changed — changed entirely — and even those who, fully 
recognizing the salutary iniiuence of the classical Knguages upon 
European culture, desire to see it perpetuated, must confess that it is 
impossible to restore the old conditions. The national idioms have been 
invested with their natural rights, and much as we may deplore the 
polylingual character of scientific literature, which prevents our read- 
ing a number of excellent disquisitions in the original, yet we must 
acknowledge that no power on earth is able to effect a change in the 
near future. Our educational institutions only in exceptional cases 
graduate men who can speak Latin or write a Latin paper with ease, 
and the universities, despite their reluctance, have been forced to 
diminish the time given to instruction in the Latin language and grad- 
ually to eliminate it from their business transactions. 

From the first, the prominence of Latin was a weak point in the 
humanistic schools. To be sure, it was not a matter of choice with 
them; in their time Latin was the universal language of the church 
and of law, and they themselves were Latin schools. They merely 
continued what had become a general custom through the practice of 
a thousand years. But their obedience to the custom was an element 
of weakness in their constitution, for the i)roductions of the classical 
writers of Eome ranked far below those of Greece. The best of them, 
indeed, owed their culture to Greek predecessors, and the school of 
Athens through all times maintained its preeminent place in the esteem 
of men. Its teaching formed the background of all scholarly work, 
and our occidental culture has derived from Greek literature its most 
stimulating ideas and its most familiar forms. Homer, Herodotus, 
Aristotle, and Plato continue to the j^resent day to be the masters of 
the nations. 



6 GO STUDY AND RESEARCH. 

The couliict is still undecided. When Greek authors began to be 
read in the original, interest vanished in the works of Latin writers 
as literature. Nevertheless the Latin language maintained the chief 
place in the curriculum of the schools. But its study became less and 
less exhaustive; as the use of the language decreased from day to 
day, rhetoric was dispensed with, and attention confined to grammar. 
Indeed, the instruction in grammar usurped so much time that even 
Latin composition became a pium desiderium. 

It is plain, then, that we have arrived at a turning i^oint with regard 
to the classical languages. Discipline in grammar is not the instrument 
of progress needed by our youth. It does not induce that delight in 
study which is a condition of independent development; on the con- 
trary, it is obvious that for many pupils, ijerhaps still more for many 
parents, it has become a hateful pursuit. Greek has been more than 
half abandoned ; no teacher in the preparatory schools dreams of giving 
the general run of pupils such instruction as to fit them on graduation 
to read and construe Greek authors in the original. Apparently the 
medical faculty has most reason to lament the displacement of Greek, 
seeing that its science is the only one which, for more than two thou- 
sand years, has built itself up without a break on the basis of Greek 
works. But it can not be denied that Hippocrates and Galen have so 
few points in common with modern medicine that, although the latter 
reverently clings to Greek terminology, the study of those authors is 
of inappreciable importance in the judgment of diseased states. The 
essential value of Greek literature accordingly lies not in its technical, 
but in its philosophic and poetic ])ortious, whose educational influence 
we are inclined to underrate at present. 

In the domain of philology, however, a significant innovation has 
grown up, which we may proudly claim as the achievement of German 
scholarship, namely, comi^arative philology. Througli it the proper 
place has first been assigned to the genetic element in ]»hilology. Even 
now it has furnished results of inestimable value in the history of 
civilization. Constant additions to this fund of discoveries lead us 
to expect that comparative linguistics will remain an integral part of 
higher education. Its details, naturally, will be rendered accessible 
only by means of university instruction. In deciding the course of 
the higher preparatory schools we are concerned only with the two 
classical and the modern languages. All that the university teacher 
must insist upon is that, no matter what languages may be prescribed, 
they be taught in a manner to train the pupil for original research and 
to preserve his delight in study. It remains to be seen whether new 
methods of teaching will effect these results. 

At present we are prepared to cite subjects of instruction in which 
the methods of teaching are so well planned that they amply furnish 
the needed discipline. They are mathematics, philosophy, and the 
natural sciences. On the one hand, they are so abundant and diversified 



STUDY AND RESEARCH. 661 

in contents that tlie desire for knowledge is constantly stimulated, and, 
on tlie other hand, by their essential nature they offer wide opi)ortuuity 
for original investigation. These advantages explain why their study 
schools the mind of the young so thoroughly that it easily familiarizes 
itself with the work of any of the faculties. 

Instruction in at least the elements of these branches has long been 
part of the regular course at our higher institutions. Onlythe amount 
of knowledge to be considered the standard has varied from time to 
time. The opinions of teachers and of the state officials authorized to 
make decisions changed frequently, and in the end the overwhelm- 
ingly i)hilological character of their education always militated against 
a more extended engagement in those studies. Only the necessity of 
meeting the exigencies of swiftly progressing technics and of the indus- 
trial arts keeping pace therewith extorted concessions, and as it was 
believed that they could not be carried out at the humanistic institu- 
tions a division of labor was finally resolved upon, and produced the 
Real-Schule and Real-Gymnasium, and, as a further result, the higher 
technical schools. 

The expedient has not proved successful in establishing permanent 
peace. We are in the heat of the conflict about the prerogatives of the 
different kinds of higher schools, particularly the admission of the grad- 
uates of the Eeal-Schule first to university courses and then to state 
offices. Again and again the cry resounds for a homogeneous school 
system, and especially for the radical reform of gymnasium methods. 
Probably not all these pretensions are equally just. 

As a rule the universities have refused to support the demand of the 
Eeal-Schule to admit its graduates as such. They are apt to be partial 
to the Gymnasium. As intimated above, the interests of the diflereut 
faculties with regard to the character of preparatory education are not 
identical. The faculties that depend upon philological aids in the fur- 
therance of their pecnliar educational mission will not be satisfied with 
preparatory work that assigns a more or less subordinate place to the 
classical languages; while those in w^hose departments knowledge of 
the ancient languages is not the indispensable condition for the under- 
standing of their specialties must consider to what extent a full course 
in mathematics and the natural sciences offers adequate compensation 
for deficiencies in the classical education. Experience has not yet 
helped us to come to a decision on this point. This circumstance may, 
however, be adduced: Among the foreigners admitted to our various 
departments not a few have attended the lectures zealously and with 
praiseworthy results, in spite of not having enjoyed Gymnasium training 
in our sense of the term. 

The practical requirements of the different faculties with regard to 
the i)reparatory work of the matriculates differ undeniably. It remains 
for the future to show whether a single sort of higher educational insti- 
tution can fulfill all. One assertion can even now be definitely made. 



662 STUDY AND RESEARCH. 

If tlie classical languages are no longer able to furnisli tlie bond that 
nnites all the provinces of culture, a substitute can be found only in the 
lustrous triad — mathematics, philosophy, and the sciences — upon whose 
development occidental culture in all its ramifications depends. 

For our present purpose it is of secondary importance to determiue 
that this culture has its roots in the Orient — in Egypt or Babylonia. So 
far as we are concerned occidental culture began on the western shore 
of Asia Minor, among the Ionian Greeks, the first to base their specu- 
lations about the universe on the mathematical computation of celestial 
phenomena, and the first to create a natural philosophy which summed 
ui) in a harmonious review all knowledge and conceptions of nature 
and her forces. In this jihilosophy is contained the begiuning of those 
general speculations upon the world characteristically called "world- 
wisdom" (Weltweisheit) by the Germans, which have gradually led to a 
complete transformation of the old ideas of heaven and earth and man 
himself; an achievement that forms the imperishable glory of Greek 
philosophy. 

The occidental nations, it must be admitted, were very late in attain- 
ing to an understanding thereof After the fall of Constantinople, 
when the Greek scholars fled to Italy and knowledge of Greek litera- 
ture spread rapidly, and when in Germany the humanists arose and 
one university after another was founded, only then the independent 
spirit of research awakened in all the nations. Mathematicians and 
scientific men of marked originality appeared, aud soon philosophers 
were at work accommodating the conceptions about man to the new 
views and sounding the very depths of intellectual life. 

A little after the beginning of this momentous i^eriod he arose whose 
gigantic achievement civilized men are at present celebrating. Day 
before yesterday it was four hundred years since Christopher Columbus 
first gained sight of a strip of land belonging to that New World where 
thousands are now exulting in his memory. For him was reserved the 
enviable fortune to demonstrate at a stroke, by means of a hazardous 
experiment, the sphericity of the earth, and at the same time to open 
up the vastest playground ever granted to human enterprise. Let us 
offer due homage to his genius and energy on this spot, too. Let us not 
forget that, despite his errors, which at the present moment we are 
inclined to emphasize too strenuously perhaps, he is the creator of a 
new time, the time of new thoughts and new actions ! 

After him there was activity everywhere in the world of the intellect. 
Next to great mathematicians and astronomers arose physicists of the 
first rank; the reform movement developed in the church, and the 
corner stone of the modern structure of medicine was laid. Even now 
we are in the midst of the upheaval, but victory is everywhere on the 
side of the new. Our age has already earned the title of the age of 
the natural sciences. No branch of intellectual endeavor has been 
able to escape the modern influence. The Eoman Church itself, the 



STUDY AND RESEARCH. 663 

energetic antagonist of the movement, lias liacl to yield, and a qualified 
representative of the Evangelical Church, our esteemed colleague, Dill- 
man, a few years ago made use of the following significant words in his 
rectorate address: "A church which is unable to stand the light of 
science, or is compelled to mitigate its brilliance by all sorts of colored 
glasses, should be laid with the dead." Truly the modern conception 
of life is based AvholJy upon the natural sciences, and no one can 
seriously dispute the fact. 

In view thereof the question is permissible whether the young- 
charges of our higher schools ought not to be initiated into this new 
knowledge to a greater degree than hitherto. We willingly concede 
that disputed points, upon which the authorities themselves are not 
agreed, shall be excluded from the instruction in the schools, and shall 
be reserved for the special training at the university. On the other 
hand, it is just to demand that a young man supposed to be sufficiently 
self-dependent to make proper use of academic liberty of study should 
be able to take in the chief results of astronomic and biologic science 
without danger to himself. Can he be considered mature if his whole 
world in a sense is closed to him ? And how can the instruction at the 
university be expected to take effect when the young man is left 
without the instruments needed for his difficult work ? 

He needs mathematics, not for its own sake nor to be able to under- 
stand the movements of the heavenly bodies. Physics has gradually 
turned into a mathematical science, and even chemistry and physiology 
find themselves forced daily with more urgency to make delicate calcu- 
lations. They enable the investigator to i^enetrate to the comprehen- 
sion of the most recondite processes, and to learn not only to Judge of 
the strength of living forces, but to calculate them accurately, and so 
regulate their j)ractical application. 

But mathematics alone is inadequate. Thinking is a necessary fiic- 
tor in understanding. Many have an idea that it is supererogation to 
make thinking an object of study; that systematic thinking is not 
indispensable to success. Unfortunately even logic has fallen almost 
into oblivion among students. At many schools the opinion prevails 
that it is sufficient occasionally to quote a proposition of logic. How 
is it possible for one who does not know the laws of thought to study 
psychology ? How can the complex relations between spiritual acts and 
the j)hysical constitution be made clear to him? The young medical 
student enjoys an advantage in this regard; but what can be expected 
of the jurist, the theologian, the pedagogue? At least the school can 
inculcate respect for philosophy; even that were a great attainment. 
The impulse to learn to think philosophically would soon assert itself. 

Finally the natural sciences. What admirable topics for study and 
for instruction are offered by the descriptive sciences — botany, zoology, 
and mineralogy! It is a misconception to assume that the university 
teacher lays chiei" stress upon systematic information. By no means; 



6G4 STUDY AND RESEARCH. 

the facts of a science can be taugiit as well at the university. No pupil 
is harmed by ability to name and distinguish a number of plants, ani- 
mals, or minerals. But the real discipline to be derived from the sci- 
ences ought to consist in the education of the senses, more particularly 
of sight and touch. At present we complain that many in our classes 
have no precise knowledge of colors; that they make false statements 
about the form of objects in full view; that they show no appreciation 
of the consistency and the surface characteristics of bodies. Nothing 
would be easier than to give an accurate description of color and form, 
if teachers required their pupils to make a drawing, a mere sketch, in 
pencil or in colors, of the objects they have observed. Such knowledge 
is useful to everybody; to the medical man it is invaluable, as not infre- 
quently most important diagnoses depend upon his skill in this direction. 

The experimental sciences, too, especially physics and chemistry, are 
essential in a complete course of study; more than anything else they 
reveal the genetic and causal relations of jirocesses, and prepare the 
student for the methodical consideration of even the more difficult 
problems of biology. As a matter of course oidy the simpler and more 
conqirehensible exi)eriments can be considered in connection with a gen- 
eral course preparatory for academic study. But every graduate of the 
higher schools should at least have an inkling of this method in order 
to be able to form an opinion. 

The enumeration of the elements tliat go to make up acceptable prep- 
aration for university work has been rather lengthy, not because of the 
multiplicity of subjects to be passed in review, but because in the pres- 
ent state of the question as to the relation of the university to the 
preparatory schools the chief consideration is the amount of prepara- 
tion necessary to make university instruction profitable. To avoid mis- 
conception it should be added that many of the branches mentioned 
may seem suj)erfluous to the student who means to confine himself to 
his specialty. But if the state intended to provide only for specialists, it 
could dispense with universities; it could establish separate ecoles, as 
iu France, or separate colleges, as in England, or separate ccenobiums, 
as iu tlie Eoman Church. If we cling to the idea of universitas, if we 
take pride in being more than an agglomeration of specialty schools, 
then we must look to it that there shall be real collaboration among the 
faculties; that general scientific culture shall accompany devotion to a 
specialty. If, however, we find to our great regret that we fall far 
short of this ideal, which we can and should attain, then the blame 
must be cast upon the inadequacy of preparatory work which I have 
sought to describe and which I expect to see remedied by means of an 
accurate presentation of the facts. 

So long as the remedy is not discovered, nothing remains but for the 
university to provide instruction in certain elementary or at least pre- 
liminary subjects, which, to bo sure, is a burden and a degradation, 
and yet rarely suffices to till up tlie gaps left by the preparatory work. 



STUDY AND RESEARCH. 665 

The university teacher has the less time for instruction of that kind, as 
the university is not only an institution for study, but also an institu- 
tion for research, the latter in a double sense. Our nation is accustomed 
to look upon its university teachers as investigators, and, on the other 
hand, science and the state depend upon us bo train up as investiga- 
tors at least a portion of the students. From this point of view we apply 
the term academic to the members as well as to the institutions of the 
university. 

The old name academy, in Plato's sense, a school aspiring to the high- 
est aims of spiritual endeavor, since the days of the Medici has been 
used to designate the associations of distinguished thinkers and original 
workers banded together for untrammeled interchange of ideas. This 
is the origin of the academies of sciences. In later times all imaginable 
sorts of academies grew up beside them; but they do not concern us 
now. Only the academy of sciences is charged with the progressive 
investigation of scientific problems as its chief task. But in Germany 
there are only three, at the utmost four, such academies, and their 
capacity is by no means large enough to insure progress in the wide 
domain of science. Katurally a part of their duty fell to the share of 
the universities, and they fulfilled it honorably, in some cases with 
distinction. This is the reason why the university teacher needs more 
time than must be devoted to mere instruction. 

In the other direction, too, as I said before, in the education of new 
generations of original workers and teachers, a solemn obligation rests 
upon the universities. It is a paramount duty, upon whose efiicient 
performance depends the steady recruiting of the ranks of the privat- 
docenten, a constituent element of the faculty, the nursery of future 
professors, which is indispensable to the prosperity of the university. 
Therefore we must begin early to train students as original investi- 
gators. Opportunities are ample, since governments everywhere have 
created institutes and seminaries in which not only guidance and 
instruction are offered, but also free and independent work. We have 
special reason to be grateful to our own Government for its indefatiga- 
ble care in establishing and enlarging such institutions. The moneys 
expended on them are well invested. They bear abundant fruit, and 
we are justified in the confidence that in the future, too, funds will be 
forthcoming to satisfy the ever-growing needs. We are accustomed to 
have Prussian kings consider the founding of scientific establishments, 
even in most perilous times, as their sacred duty as rulers, indeed, as a 
means of strengthening the state. Our own university grew up under 
such circumstances and out of such considerations, but, not having been 
endowed with a sufficient sum to be index^endent, it must look to tlie 
state for constant help. May it to day recommend itself anew to the 
favor and the provident care of our Government! 



SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTUKE.i 



By Lieut. CoL H. Elsdale. 



An able writer, Mr. Pearson, has recently observed in Lis work, 
National Progress and National Character, that few or no farther lead- 
ing discoveries or new departures in physical or mechanical science are 
to be expected; that future generations have now only to fill in the 
details and to supplement what has already been done. 

I can not agree with him. We must not thus set limits to the invent- 
iveness of mankind. The well-known epithet nEpi^padr]^ av))p will 
justify itself in the future as in the past. Nor can we set arbitrary 
bounds to the inexhaustible secrets of nature, and to the importance of 
the new arrangements and fresh combinations which are open to further 
research into them. An ever larger and larger number of fertile brains 
are continually at work in discovery and invention, as is clearly shown 
by the most cursory study of the annual publications of any of the 
various State patent offices. And these fresh brains start from an ever- 
wideniug vantage ground of accumulated research and proved expe- 
rience. The result must surely be that important inventions and new 
discoveries will crowd thicker upon the world in the twentieth than in 
the nineteenth century. I think that we have now looming before us 
in the immediate future, darkly no doubt, but still very distinctly, 
leading discoveries in science which will constitute new departures 
fully as large as, if not larger than, those which have resulted from, 
let us say, the introduction of railways or telegraphs in the past. Their 
number may possibly be legion. I j)ropose here to confine myself to the 
consideration of four leading problems, some, if not all, of which seem 
practically certain of solution in the next generation, if not in our own. 
And their solution will involve rcvsults of enormous and almost incal- 
culable importance to the future of mankind. 



The conquest of the air is the first of them. Aerial navigation has 
been the dream of enterprising and inventive men in all the ages, and 
that dream is now drawing near to its realization.

668 SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE 

The invention of balloons lias no doubt given some impetus to the 
study of the subject, and navigable balloons of increasing speed and 
importance are at this moment being made on the Continent. Thus, 
the latest improved machine now under construction for the French 
war office is expected to obtam a speed of 40 kilometers, or nearly 25 
miles, an hour. The navigable balloon, however, at its best, will, on a 
broad view, provide nothing more than a convenient stepping-stone or 
intermediate stage, to pave the way for the flying machine proper, 
which will certainly follow and supersede it in the future. Meanwhile, 
unless some bold inventor should bring forward speedily a true flying 
machine, we may expect to see successive modifications in, or progres- 
sive forms of, navigable balloons introducing the principle of the flying 
machine proper gradually and tentatively. 

Thus, whereas at present all the weight is sustained by the balloon, 
in future models the greater part of the weight only will probably be 
gas-sustained, and the rest of the lifting power and necessary changes 
of elevation will be provided for by the lifting action of air screws. 
By and by the air screw, or air propulsion in some form, will predomi- 
nate. The balloon will be first reduced to an auxiliary appliance, and 
then laid aside altogether. The result, of course, of its final rejection 
will be an immense gain in a greatly diminished resistance and a corre- 
sponding increase in speed and power. 

When first it became my duty to study this subject, some thirteen 
or fourteen years ago, the flying machine proper was a demonstrable 
impossibility in the then condition of mechanical science. Since that 
time the problem has been attacked and its great acknowledged diffi- 
culties steadily minimized from three diflerent quarters simultaneously. 
The net result has been to reduce it to far more moderate and manage- 
able dimensions; and if a corresi)on(Ung rate of progress is to be main- 
tained for another thirteen or fourteen years, this great problem is 
morally certain of solution. 

I do not propose here to consider the subject in any detail or to give 
any figures or calculations upon it, but rather to confine myself to such 
observations on its leading conditions as are necessary to explain and 
support the above statement and to indicate generally our present 
position on the whole question. 

The problem of aerial navigation by flying machines hinges prima- 
rily, of course, on the ratio of power developed by, to weight involved 
in, the motor. Only thirteen years ago that ratio Avas simply prohibi- 
tory. Any competent mechanical engineer who considered the matter 
could have no difficulty in concluding that it was then practically 
impossible to make a motor on any large and safe working scale which 
would lift its own weight, much less the weight of a heavy i)assenger- 
carrying machine and passengers as well. Since that date a large 
progress has been achieved, and motors can now be made which, for 
the same weight, will give a greatly increased power. One of the latest 



SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE. 669 

new departures iu this Hue is the motor which Mr. Hiram Maxim has 
worked out for his flying- machine. I have had the privilege of inspect- 
ing it, and can certify that, whatever be the merits or ultimate success 
of the machine generally, it is a marvel of mechanical ingenuity, and 
the motor especially develops an extraordinary and unprecedented 
amount of power for weight carried. 

yide by side with tliis great increase of power iu the motors, and of 
equal importance, perhaps, in its bearing on the general question, we 
must next consider the great fall in the price of aluminium, together 
with the progress which has been made in the study of its valuable 
alloys, such as the alloy with about 5 per cent of copper. 

Within my recollection the price of aluminium has fallen from a guinea 
to about 2 shillings the ounce weight. A very moderate further fall in 
price — far less than the above great and recent fall of 90 per cent — and 
a little further corresponding iirogress in the study of the nature and 
properties of these alloys, will cause aluminium alloys to drive steel out 
of the market for many important engineering purposes, such as the 
construction of bridges of wide span. And the new metals will be of 
cardinal importance to aerial navigation, as they are the material upon 
which we must rely for the construction of the flying machines of the 
future. 

The third direction in which very important i)rogress has been 
achieved recently is the theoretical and practical study of the condi- 
tions which govern the resistance of the air and determine the laws of 
flight or locomotion, as well as of suspension therein. The resistance of 
the air is the one all-sufilicieut fulcrum or basis on which every flying 
machine must rely. In the investigation of its laws something has 
been done by the study of the flight of birds and the analysis of the 
results of instantaneous photographs of them, especially by modern 
French writers. For the laws which govern the flight of birds must, 
mutatis mutandis — that is, in principle — apply to all aerial locomotion. 
Hence, in the last edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica we see prog- 
ress on the subject. Thus we find therein an instructive table, showing 
clearly that, contrary to many people's ideas upon the subject, the sus- 
taining or wing area in all flying bodies in nature increases in a much 
less proportion than the increased weight to be carried. For the swal- 
low or the sparrow has a much less proportionate area of wing than the 
fly, the gnat, or the beetle; and the vulture or wild swan a much less 
area than the swallow. This is an important fundamental fact in aerial 
navigation, as showing that the flying machine of the future can be 
made of very moderate dimensions. But by far the most useful prog- 
ress in this direction has been made by Professor Langley in his excel- 
lent " Experiments in aerodynamics," wherein he may fairly be said to 
have laid down, for the first time, a really sound and reliable scientific 
basis for the study of aerial locomotion by a series of careful experi- 
ments and well-reasoned deductions from them. We may note with 



670 SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE. 

pleasure that Professor Langley is reported to be now engaged upon a 
model aerial macliine on a working scale. Whatever its ultimate meas- 
ure of success, his new experiments with it can not fail to advance the 
cause of aerial navigation another stage. 

I repeat that the net result of modern progress in these three direc- 
tions — the study of the governing conditions of the work to be done, 
the increase in the power of the motor necessary for doing it, and the 
decrease in its amount, or in the weights to be lifted — has been to 
bring the x^roblem of aerial locomotion well within the range of prac- 
tical men. What is now required is that the field of research and 
experiment should no longer be left to uni:)ractical enthusiasts, as for 
the most part it has been of yore. It is high time that really compe- 
tent and well-informed mechanical engineers should follow the example 
of Mr. Maxim and Professor Langley by turning their attention to the 
subject. Once let this be done, and I am satisfied that the j)roblem will 
be in a fair way of solution, and can not fail ultimately of a satisfactory 
issue. Nevertheless, after some considerable study of the question, I 
have a persuasion amounting to a conviction that whatever partial or 
temporary- success may attend all such machines as Mr. Maxim's, 
which depend upon locomotion through the air for sustaining power in 
it, the ultimate solution of the problem will be something diiferent. 
That is, I believe that a really safe, workable, and reliable flying 
machine must be based upon the i»rinciple of dissociating the stable 
vertical suspension in the air, if required, from horizontal locomotion 
through it. Such a machine must be callable of rising vertically in 
the air in a dead calm, and remaining suspended in it, as apart from, 
or in addition to, any question of horizontal locomotion through the 
air. Moreover, it must be so constructed that no possible breakdown 
or failure in any engine or in any part of the gear will endanger the 
lives of the passengers. But these conditions will no doubt involve a 
considerable further reduction in the ratio of weight carried to power 
developed in the motor, and for this we must be content to await the 
further progress of science. 

Once let this vital issue of stable suspension in the air be satisfac- 
torily achieved in a really sound, safe, and reliable way, and the conse- 
quences which will follow from the new departure are enormous and 
incalculable. Locomotion through the air, as straight as an arrow from 
a bow, and at a hitherto unheard-of rate of speed, will immediately and 
easily follow, and the resulting machine is bound for light transport to 
distance all competition in locomotion, whether by land or by sea. For 
one of the special and leading advantages attaching to aerial, as opposed 
to all ordinary locomotion at present, is that increased speed will not 
involve a great and disproportionate increase of power as it does now. 
It is perfectly well known to every, marine engineer, and to every well- 
informed man everywhere, that an enormous increase of power is nec- 
cessary to gain a very moderate increase of speed in ocean navigation. 



SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE. 671 

Thus, if a steamer with a given horsepower will run at say 14 knots an 
hour, if we double that horsepower we may only succeed in driving her 
some 16 knots more or less — that is, the doubling of the horsepower will 
only give us one-seventh additional increase in speed. But in aerial 
locomotion the conditions are radically different, and the gain is all the 
other way. Thus, if a flying machine with a given horsepower will run 
at say 50 miles an hour, with less than double that horsepower it will 
be likely to run 100 miles, so that the increased power required for 
doubling the speed is most moderate, instead of being enormous and 
XDrohibitory as it would be in water trans^jort. 

The aerial navigation of the future will not only be much swifter and 
more direct, being in a straight course over moor, mountain, or bog, wood, 
ravine, or river, but it will also be much safer than our ordinary locomo- 
tion by railway and steamer at present. For as the traffic on our rail- 
ways and steamboats steadily increases, the risk of accident on the 
crowded lines and ocean thoroughfares, due to a set of objects all 
moving in one horizontal plane, increases continually, as we are already 
finding out in many a disastrous collision. But once let this problem of 
stable suspension in the air be satisfactorily solved, and we shall cut 
oft' at a stroke a whole host of causes and possible contingencies which 
now inevitably involve continual risk of accident. For the flying 
machine of the future will travel directly and independently through 
the air from point to point. It will incur no risks from drowsy or over- 
worked signalmen, from inevitable imperfections in or obstructions upon 
the permanent Avay, from chances and contingencies due to the running 
of excursion trains or extra traffic, from icebergs, or floating hulks, rocks, 
shoals, treacherous currents, unreliable compasses, or other hindrances 
to safe navigation. If it meet or overtake a fellow machine in the air, 
it has the whole wide ocean of air above or below it in which to pass in 
safety, besides an unlimited field on either hand. An endless number 
of external sources of accident will be eliminated. Once let the flying 
machine be stable, strong, safe, and powerful enough for its work, and 
it will represent the safest kind of locomotion ever invented. 

It will compete with the railways for light traffic, such as the trans- 
port of mails, on terms which must apparently confer an overwhelming 
advantage. Thus, if "we roughly set the cost of the stations along 100 
miles of our English railways, and the cost, working, maintenance, and 
renewal of the aerial machines against the corresponding charges for 
engines, rolling stock, and working expenses on the line, we have the 
following advantages to score to the aerial line : 

Annual interest at, say, r> per cent on the first cost of 100 miles of line at 
£39,000 a mile, which has been about the average cost of construction of 
English railways £ 195, 000 

Annual charge for maintenance or renewal of the permanent way, at £231 
per mile = 23, 100 

Total 218.100 



672 SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE. 

This shows that in aid of the inainteuauce and working of 100 miles 
of aerial line, or as increased dividends to the shareholders, there will 
be an annnal subsidy of more than £200,000, representing the saving 
on the cost of a corresponding length of railway. It will be seen that 
the gain is so great that it is scarcely credible that any possible increase 
in the working expenses of the aerial line, as compared with the cor- 
responding charges on the railway, could swallow it up. 

The revolution made in locomotion by the flying machine, whereby 
we shall be able to run from London to New York in perhaps from 
thirty-six to forty-eight hours, and from London to Paris and back 
between breakfast and luncheon, will be at least as great as that caused 
recently by the introduction of railways and steam navigation. 

I can not go into the principles of construction of these aerial machines 
further than to say, as I have already said elsewhere in a professional 
publication, that they will probably be of very moderate size, much 
less than the huge navigable balloon for military purposes, for Miiich 
they will be most valuable, and will be speedily adopted. For ordinary 
or civil purposes also they will no doubt be small at first, but it is im])os- 
sible to set limits to their future development. The web, or superposed 
webs, of aeroplane, part steadying, part sustaining, which will be their 
leading external feature, will be inclined during flight at a very small 
angle with the horizon tal, probably not more than lA to lf°. Inside 
this, or below it, there will be a long low car, presenting a minimum 
surface to the air, in which j^assengers, light baggage, or mails will be 
carried. And the machines will run, as above, at a tremendous pace, 
probably up to, or even exceeding, 100 miles an hour. 

Finally, I repeat that if anything like the same rate of progress is 
to be maintained during the next ten or fifteen years as has actually 
been made during the last ten or fifteen years, the problem of aerial 
imvigation by flying machines, which ten years ago was tlemonstrably 
insuperable in the then condition of mechanics, and which at present 
is very difficult, if not altogether impossible, will soon be comparatively 
easy, and will be morally certain of solution.

A wise man of old, in naming three things which puzzled him, 
associated together "the way of a fish in the sea" and "the way of a 
fowl in the air." It is here proposed to follow his example, and, having 
disposed of the way of the fowl in the air in discussing the question of 
aerial navigation, to consider next whether any important new depar- 
tures are not possible and even probable in marine locomotion. I believe 
they are quite possible and probable, whether in the immediate or in 
the more remote future. Any revolution which may be effected in this 
direction will not be as startling and wonder-provoking as the con- 
quest of the air. Nevertheless, such a future conquest of the water, 
as we may ])erhaps caU it, may prove ultimately to be of very great 
importance. 



SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE. 673 

I believe, tlieu, that a practical revolutiou iu niariue navigation is 
possible, if we ouly will set ourselves, with the wise man of old, to 
study the way of the fish in the sea. With all possible respect to the 
numerous professors and students and innumerable practical men 
engaged in marine engineering and marine locomotion generally, I 
would venture to challenge them to consider carefully whether they 
are not all, in the main, on the wrong tack. They are one and all, so 
far as appears by a study of all tlie publications, as the Engineer, 
Engineering, the Scientific American, etc., setting themselves steadily 
to gain increased speed by a continual development of the locomotive 
power. Successive improvements in engines, boilers, screws, economy 
of fuel, and so on, are all very desirable in their way no doubt. But 
these things seem to me unduly to monopolize attention to the exclusion 
of the one vital problem which appears to contain the key to the 
whole question — namely', the diminishing of fluid resistance. At 
present, as w^e increase the jiropulsive power continually, we are con- 
tinually piling up extra resistance to meet and swallow it up. I repeat, 
that any great further progress iu ocean navigation is to be sought 
and obtained by a careful and scientific study of the way of the fish 
in the sea. 

The subject of fluid resistance, as the leading and governing fiictor 
in all water iiropulsion, may probably be novel to most readers, since, 
if the question has ever been publicly discussed at all, it has been in 
naval or other special publications. It seems necessary, therefore, to 
rehearse the matter briefly from the beginning. 

Years ago I was informed by Mr. Brenuan, the inventor of the well- 
known torpedo, that he applied no less than 100 horsepower to drive 
his torpedo at its then speed, say probably at about 24 knots an hour, 
or 25 at the outside. Xow this torpedo is well designed to the eye and 
was adapted, to the best of the judgment of a clever inventor, for fluid 
propulsion. It is, or then was, no larger tlian a good-sized porpoise, or, 
say, a very moderate-sized shark. But anyone who on an ocean voyage 
has watched a school of porpoises playing round an Atlantic liner will 
agree with me that they experience no difficulty whatever in swimming 
at such a pace as this and in keeping it up apparently for an Indefinite 
length of time. 

If now we turn to any professor of physiology and ask him what 
power a porpoise, or a small shark of about the same size as the torpedo, 
can reasonably be expected to develop and maintain, he will probably 
tell us 1 horsepower, or, if he were disposed to be liberal, he might per- 
haps say 2. Anyway, whatever be the exact expenditure of force in 
the loropulsiou of the porpoise, for which I have no data and do not 
stop to argue, it is clear that if it were to develop anything in the 
remotest degree approaching to tlie power required to drive the torj^edo 
at the same speed it would quickly be reduced to impotence. It would 
rapidly burn wp and consume the tissues of its body in such an immense 
SM 94 43 



674 SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE. 

production of energy, and in a few minutes we should see it floating on 
the water an inert and lifeless mass, instead of sporting about as lively 
as ever, as we actually do see it. Now, wlience comes this enormous 
difference in the power required to propel the porpoise and the torpedo 
at the same speed? The answer to this question contains, as I sub- 
mit, the true and proper line of develoi)ment of the marine engineering 
of the future. 

No doubt we shall be told at once that steamships can not imitate 
the movements of the porpoise, that his motion is a question of fluid 
displacement and '' stream-line" action or effect, due to the sinuous 
inflections of his body, and of his tail especially. This is i^artly +rue, 
and it is not here contended that we can make ships with flexible back- 
bones like a fish, and give them a fish-like motion. Nevertheless it 
appears i^robable, if not certain, that the main and essential cause of 
the enormous waste of power at present attaching to man's work, the 
ship or the torpedo, when compared with nature's work, the porpoise 
or the shark, is surface or skin friction. 

That skin friction is the leading agent in rendering necessary the 
immense power required to pro2)el ocean steamers or battle ships through 
the water is clearly recognized by the chief authorities on the subject, 
such as Mr. White in his standard work on naval architecture. Herein 
he only follows on the principles which were first, I think, formulated 
by the elder Mr. Fronde, late investigator of marine problems to the 
British Admiralty, in a paper read many years ago at a meeting of 
the British association at Bristol. In order to clear away a prevail 
ing misconception, or popular error, which quite vitiates any sound 
argument on this whole subject, it seems necessary to refer to Mr. 
Fronde's paper. Therein he demonstrated that the idea that the resist 
ance to motion of a body through water is to be measured by " head'' 
resistance, or the resistance of its cross secti<m, to passage through the 
water is baseless and mistaken. There is really no such thing as head 
resistance, so that if a fairly well-designed body, such as a torpedo, were 
entirely immersed in a perfect fluid and started in motion at any given 
speed it would, if there were no surface friction, continue to move 
uniformly in a straight line ad infinitum. The result of this law, as 
applied to water, which is not quite a perfect fluid, but has some small 
amount of viscosity, is that very nearly but not quite all — about 98 per 
cent, speaking approximately from memory — of the total resistance to 
the motion of such a torpedo underwater is due to skin or fluid friction. 
Any consideral)le reduction therefore in this friction avouUI efl'ect a very 
large corresponding gain in the speed of the submerged body, or a 
diminution in the power required to propel it at the same speed. 

When we come to deal with the case of bodies only partly submerged, 
such as shii3s, the matter is not .so simple, as a very appreciable fraction 
of the total resistance to motion is due to the action of waves and wind, 
and involves a consideration of length, depth, etc., on the part of the 



SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE. 675 

ship, as compared with the magnitude, period, direction, aud character 
oi the opposing waves. Nevertheless Mr. White, to whom I again refer 
as the leading authority, has clearly laid down that a varying percent- 
age, amounting always to considerably the larger half, of the total 
resistance to such a vessel's motion through the water is still due to 
surface or skin friction. 

Broadly, therefore, we are brought to this conclusion, that this friction 
is the leading and essential cause of the great waste of power in the 
propulsion of all vessels of man's design, whether partly or wholly sub- 
merged, when comi>ared with the natural propulsion of fish or marine 
animals, such as whales, under corresponding circumstances and condi- 
tions. Hence the question of the i)0ssible reduction of tliis friction is 
one of vast and supreme importance to the marine engineer. 

Now if we saw that nature solved this problem in only one way, and 
that way clearly inapplicable to such bodies as steamships, we might 
well despair of any good result to be obtained by inquiry and investi- 
gation into the subject. Thus, if all fish, marine animals, and rapidly 
moving aquatic birds were all alike coated with slime like the eel we 
might fairly conclude that, as we can hardly hope to coat her Majesy's 
iiionclads with perpetual slime, we may give the question up. But as 
a matter of fact we find on a very slight consideration of the subject 
tUat nature solves this problem in many and various diiferent ways. 
The slime of the eel whereby, as we may perhaps i^resume, he is enabled 
to slip easily through the water has no sort or kind of resemblance to 
the rough, hard, shagreen, or tough outer skin of the shark, nor is this, 
again, in the least like the scales of the numerous varieties of scale fish, 
the fur of the otter or the seal, or the feathers of a rapidly diving bird. 
Here, therefore, as it appears, is a vast field open to inquiry, investiga- 
tion, and exi)eriment. 

As I think, it is a much more promising field than our present system 
of piling up enormous engine power to meet an enormous and ever- 
increasing-resistance. For we have already said that the resistance 
to our locomotion through water at present increases in a rapidly 
increasing ratio as we increase the speed; whereas it seems clear that 
nature in her beautiful arrangements for dispensing with or minimizing 
skin friction contrives to avoid altogether this disproportionate piling 
up of resistance to increased speed. It should, however, be noted that 
this whole problem Is greatly comj)licated by the question of the con- 
tinual fouling of ships' bottoms, due to the growth of weeds, the shells 
of marine parasites, etc. Scientific investigators may i)iopose as many 
elaborate antifriction, surfaces as they please, but any old tar who has 
seen his shij) frequently coated thickly with barnacles and weeds, in 
spite of the use of numerous patent antifouling compositions, will be 
likely to shake his head doubtfully over them. 

This is a serious complication. It means that wc must seek for some 
substance or some system of construction for the external coating of 



676 SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE. 

our vessels which will lend itself as little as possible to the lodgment 
of such weeds and barnacles. And it also means probably that our 
ships must be overhauled in dry dock more frequently and regularly^ 
which again will involve the construction of numerous docks at suit- 
able ports along the ocean highways. But I submit that such meas- 
ures will well repay us, if thereby we can gain a more than equivalent 
increase in speed. 

Nevertheless I freely admit that it is very possible that no inert and 
lifeless surface of man's design can be or ever will be devised which 
will compete for the present puri)ose with the living skin, fur, or 
feathers which an all-wise Creator has specially adapted to the pur- 
pose of marine navigation according to the requirements of the various 
aquatic forms of life. 

But we need not thereupon despair. It would be simple folly to 
despair of this problem so long as we are so profoundly ignorant of its 
true conditions. When we have thoroughly investigated the laws and 
working of this fluid friction and ascertained its true nature and 
limits, we shall then, and not till then, be justified in forming an 
opinion as to whether it be or be not possible to meet and deal with 
it successfully by methods which are practically applicable to ocean 
navigation. 

Practical methods are the essence of the matter; for nobody is fool- 
ish enough to pretend that we can coat our ironclads externally with 
sealskin or with porpoise hide, and undoubtedly we are at a great 
disadvantage as compared with nature and her living forms. Very 
possibly the ultimate solution of this question may be found in the 
application of some new material altogether to the external coating of 
our vessels. Compressed pai^er, or compressed ramie fiber, which are 
now increasingly employed in America for railway wheels and steam 
pipes, would seem promising materials for the purpose. They admit of 
being molded externally into any minute grooves or tiny overlapping 
plates, like the scales of a fish. Little or no extra expense will thereby 
be incurred, as an enormous hydraulic pressure, capable of forming any 
required surface, is already employed in the regular course of manu- 
facture; or they can just as easily be molded into a rough shagreen, 
which in form can be made a facsimile reproduction of the skin of the 
shark, and by their tough and strong retentive structure they would 
effectually protect the steel or real skin of the vessel from corrosion by 
the salt water. But all this is mere conjecture. Any such suggestions 
which any man can propound will be nothing more than conjecture, so 
long as we are content to remain in our present deplorable darkness and 
ignorance of the real governing conditions of the problem. What we 
most require is therefore light. 

I venture to think that the lords of the Admiralty could hardly 
spend £2,000 or £3,000 a year, or whatever modest sum a systematic 
course of experiments, undertaken by a comj)etent authority like Mr. 



SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE. 677 

Fronde, mig^lit cost, with greater advantage to lier Majesty's navy and 
to tlie nation at large as tlie leading- maritime power, than by spending 
it in snch an investigation. It is easy to see the general line which a 
course of exi)eriments might take. Thns one niigbt commence with a 
real live porpoise, or, if smaller scale experiments and a cheaper plant 
be necessary, with a salmon or a pike. Tow him through the Mater, in 
a tank or pond, in a more or less inanimate and nonresisting condition, 
and measure carefully by chronograplis and power meters the exact 
horsepower required to attain a given speed or the exact time and 
speed due to a given horsepower. Then run a steel bar through him 
to kill and keep him rigid, and repeat the experiments with a view to 
ascertain how far the rigidity of form would affect the result. Next 
weigh and take an exact cast of him in plaster of paris, and cause any 
number of models to be made, all of the same uniform pattern and 
w(Mghted up to the same weight, but vary the material and surface 
structure of the models indetinitely, with a view to ascertain the con- 
ditions of minimum and maximum skin friction. Eepeat the experi- 
ment with these various models. The result of such a preliminary 
coarse of experiment, especially if carried out on a good-sized scale, say 
with models of a large porpoise or a shark, could not fail to be most 
valuable and important. It would establish incoutestably, once and 
for all, Mdiether I am correct in believing that there is any such large 
difference between the power required to tow a torpedo through the 
water and that required for a fish or marine animal of a corresponding- 
size. If so, we should learn generally how, by further systematic 
investigation, to determine the real and essential conditions on which 
this difference hinges. Thereby we should probably see eventually the 
best way of minimizing fluid friction in practice. It should be borne 
in mind that, if we could only gain a knot an hour in the speed of an 
ironclad or an Atlantic liner for a given horsepower, the result would 
be very im])ortant, and would amply repay any possible cost and 
trouble in the experiments. 

It would probably be found that a smooth surface of iron or steel is 
about the worst which we can give to our ships. For a smooth metal 
surface has apparently the property of attracting and detaining the 
particles of water in contact with it, whether by molecular attraction 
or otherwise. Thereby the water in immediate contact with the vessel's 
side or bottom is drawn along with her, and its particles communicate 
their motion to an outer circle of particles, and so on till a vast mass of 
water is set constantly in motion along with the ship. This is precisely 
what we want to avoid, as the essence of the reduction of fluid friction 
is to slip easily through the water with the least possible disturbance. 
Herein lies, as I imagine, the great advantage of the surface structure 
of the fish. It would probably be found by experiment that an exact 
model of a fish in any ordinary material, as wood, iron, steel, etc., when 
towed through the water at a given rate, would communicate motion to 



678 SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE. 

a straw or light floating object lying near its conrse to a far greater 
extent than would the real fish passing throngh the water at the same 
speed. Experiments ou this i)oint would be easy, and would be as val- 
uable and suggestive when api)lied to different materials and surfaces 
as the former suggested experiments on horsepower. 

Nature seems to abhor generally a really smooth or polished surface 
for water iiropulsion. Thus, if we put a x)iece of the skin of the sole 
under the microscope we shall see that it is composed of overlapping 
layers of scales. On the lower or outer end of each scale we see a 
number of small projecting horns or points. I can only presume that 
the i^articles of water in most immediate contact with the fish are 
passed on from scale to scale like the rain running ofl" a slated roof 
without pausing to adhere to any individual scale, and that their 
disengagement without adhesion or friction arising from molecular 
attractiou is facilitated in some way l)y the projecting rows of points. 
Further similar and collateral investigations will easily suggest them- 
selves. But enough, and perhaps more than enough, has been said. 
I will therefore conclude this discussion by repeating that the question 
of the reduction of fluid friction is one of primary importance to the 
whole future of ocean navigation, and that it is high time that the 
attention of competent marine engineers should be directed to the 
subject. 

So far I have conftned myself to this question of fluid friction, as a 
thorough study of its laws constitutes, it is contended, the proper and 
the only sound and scientific basis for the marine engineering of the 
future. But we must not stop there. It does not require the trained 
perception of a naval architect to see that we must go further. I hope 
that the majority of such skilled specialists, who take a broad view of ^ 
the present position of their profession, will agree with me that tbe 
next step after we have eliminated as far as possible, or brought down j 
to an irreducible minimum, the all-important element of fluid friction, 
will be to set ourselves to reduce similarly to a minimum the other 
important retarding element of wave action. This means probably, in 
the case especially of cargo-carrying steamships, the adoption of a 
vessel of the American whale-back type, or some suitable modification 
of it, with a light commodious superstructure for the convenience and 
comfort of passengers and crew. 

Should we be fairly successful in these two distinct objects, the 
reduction to a minimum of fluid friction by suitable modifications in 
the external materials and structure of our ships, and the similar 
reduction of retarding wave action by the employment of a long, deep, 
mainly submerged vessel, the ocean steamships of the future may 
perhai)S run at 40 or even 50 knots an hour without any undue or 
extraordinary increase in propulsive power. 

It is at present quite impossible to give any estimate of the magni- 
tude and importance of the issues involved in a successful solution of 



SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE. 679 

these problems. This will entirely depeud upon the extent to which we 
can reduce the fluid resistance. If we can eventually approximate in 
any considerable degree to the easy course of the fish, the result will 
amount to a complete revolution in ocean navigation. 

III. 

In order not to prolong this paper unduly I will only briefly mention 
two more distinct subjects in which there seems to be room for probable 
large new departures in the future, and at no remote date. 

The problem of how to extract the stored-up power in coal without 
burning it is of the first importaijce to the whole future of physical 
and mechanical science. It is generally admitted that the very best 
designed furnace is but a lame and most wasteful way of utilizing the 
vast reservoir of potential work in a ton of coal. The leading chemists 
and professors of science are aware of the magnitude and importance 
of this problem, and no doubt many able and competent brains are 
now at work upon it. The question, if I rightly apprehend it, amounts 
to this : How can we best, by some simple and practical process, reduce 
coal to a condition in which it will, when brought into conjunction with 
the inexhaustible reservoir of oxygen in the atmosphere, give us the 
necessary elements for the production of an electric battery? The suc- 
cessful solution of this problem will constitute a new era in science 
and lead to results of vast and incalculable importance in the future. 
It is quite jDossible that its early solution, by supplying us with the 
necessary conditions for the production of power in an extremely light 
and portable shape, will greatly hasten and fiicilitate a successful attack 
upon the first discussed problem of aerial navigation. 

Lastly, the problem of how to reduce the vegetable foods, which at 
present are only adapted to animals like the cow, the sheep, or the 
horse, to a condition suited to the human digestion and to the human 
palate is one of great importance. The chemical constituents of these 
vegetable foods, such as grass, are similar to those which we now con- 
sume in various existing foods, and they are adapted to the require- 
ments of the human frame. It is only a question of digestion. It can 
hardly be but that with the continual progress of organic chemistry 
and medical science some means will sooner or later be discovered of 
solving this problem. If the lu-ocess can be brought to a cheap and 
workable shape the sources of our food supply will be greatly enlarged 
and extended at a time, perhaps, when increasing population and a 
growing pressure in the struggle for existence will render such a result 
most opportune and welcome to the world. 



THE FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY AND THE 
TRANSITION FROM THE PHILOSOPHIC TO THE SCIEN- 
TIFIC AGE.i 



By Rudolph Virchow. 



A pleasant task is set the orator on this day. The sou of the founder 
of our university made choice of his father's birthday as tlie occasion 
on which to renew annually in festive assembly the memory of Ring- 
Frederick William III, and to keep alive among- all classes the feeling 
of gratitude for his high minded deed. 

The task has gradually increased in difficulty. For many years we 
were accustomed to listen to meu at this celebration who had helped to 
rear our university, which enjoys the honorable distinction of bearing 
the name of Frederick AVilliaui. As living witnesses they were qual- 
ified to give testimony of the intentions which underlay the beginnings 
of the great work. Their personal experiences enabled them to recount 
the difficulties that had to be overcome in order to realize the funda- 
mental ideas. As contemporaries of the founder finally they could 
justly claim attention when they spoke of the successes obtained by 
the new institution, and of the impediments which had often opposed 
themselves to the inner and outer development of academic life. With 
what reverent attention we younger men barkened to the Avords drop- 
ping from eloquent lips, and how wide were the circles that expected 
to hear in them a sober and frank judgment on the methods tliat had 
been employed and to receive advice and encouragement for the future ! 

The ranks of these meu have been quickly exhausted; the last of 
them has i^assed away. Even the oldest of our contemporaries who 
saw King Frederick William III belong to a younger generation, which 
had a realizing sense neither of the degradation nor of the glorious 
reconstruction of our country. We can follow up the story of the 
founding of our institution ouly by means of historic tradition, which, 
it is universally conceded, is fragmentary and untrustworthy even in 
the case of recent events. We may say with some degree of certainty 
what we have become, but we grow dubious when we are called upon 
to tell how we have become what we are. The specialist has confidence 
in himself only when his specialty is concerned, and so it happens that 
most of the recent orators of this day have preferred to depict the 
course of development in the light of their specialty.

682 FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY. 

Yet not one has been able to forego the consideration of the struggle 
through which the idea of the establishment of this university culmi- 
nated in a creative act at a time of sore hardship. Often as the story 
has been told, it must be told anew for the benefit of youth ripening 
into manhood and the refinement of endeavor in all circles of academic 
culture. It must be instilled into them that the founding of the Berlin 
University was not merely an act of highest political wisdom, but also 
an eminently moral deed. 

As early as his crown prince days, Frederick William had been drawn 
into the surging flood that was soon to submerge the whole of Europe. 
He had been compelled to take i)art in the unfortunate campaign 
against revolutionary France, which had shattered Prussia's strength. 
His father's last political act of importance, the third partition of 
Poland, had burdened him with a heritage whose baneful influence 
made itself felt for many days. He had assumed the reins of govern- 
ment filled with the most benevolent and the noblest intentions for 
the weal of his subjects. To his own country he promised economy 
and far-reaching reforms; to foreign countries, strict neutrality. He 
devoted himself earnestly to tlie atiairs of government, not in the 
perfunctory fashion of a mere administrator of the highest power, but 
with the positive energy of a true reformer. Then it was, as we know, 
that the idea of founding a university at Berlin occurred to him and 
grew strong. In vain! The inarch of European att'airs, to whose com- 
plication Frederick William II had greatly contributed, with fatalistic 
logic dragged Prussia into ruin. A single battle annihilated the army, 
and with it the state of Frederick the Great. What the arms of the 
enemy had left undone was completed by the treachery and the folly of 
the leaders. The King could save the remnant of the loyal brave only 
by leading it back across the Vistula. All the provinces beyond the 
Elbe were lost; the rest, imijoverished, bereft of practically all their 
resources, appeared to be easy booty for the conqueror. To hope for 
better days was by most held to be audacity. 

And there were audacious men in Prussia. The severity of the 
oppression, the monstrous ill-usage to which the jieople — to which even 
the King and his family — were exposed, aroused the desire for revenge 
and tlie longing for deliverance from alien rule in unsusiiected strength. 
To a greater extent than for centuries personal interests sank into the 
background to make room for the great thought of patriotism and 
liberty. Out of the chaos of passions sprang up idealism — that Ger- 
man idealism which was soon to become the hobgoblin of the conqueror. 
How long since nothing had been heard of a German Vaterland ! And 
now the poet's cry rang out, " Our country must be wider." How few 
had harbored the thought that such a Vaterland might become the 
rock of civic liberty and peace, the home of the highest aspirations 
after culture ! 

With sincere gratitude Ave must acknowledge that the King was one 



FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY. 683 

of the idealists. In tlie days of Memel and Konigsberg- lie found time 
to pass the prospects for the future in review with faithful counselors. 
Depressed by the tragic fate of the country, anxious lest new efforts 
lead to deeper humiliation, his heart full of concern about the sad 
effects upon his dear ones, he still had the strength of mind to preserve 
his personal dignity, and not only to cling to the hope of a favorable 
turn in his fortunes, but also, with truly statesman-like appreciation of 
the circumstances, to devise ways and means whereby the rehabilitation 
of the people might be made possible through its own energy. 

His deei) religious feeling, never left him during his long reign, filled 
him with immutable trust in God. " With God for King and country" 
soon became the battle cry with which the people rushed to the bitter 
war, for confidence was inspired by the caution and resolution with 
which the tried men summoned to the King's council made all pre^)- 
arations for long-delayed deliverance. It had become a principle with 
the Government to call into unhampered action all the living forces 
of the State. As early as 1807 and 1808 reforms that may be described 
as almost revolutionary were instituted. The principle that every citi- 
zen is in duty bound to serve in tlie defense of his country, wholly new 
to the modern world, was enunciated. The way was opened for the free 
economic development of the rural districts and the self-government of 
the municipal communities. New institutions in the i)rovince of peda- 
gogics were to offer the surest guarantee for the education of the peoi)le, 
and as his first and highest task the King put upon his programme the 
establishment of a university in Berlin. 

By the cession of the western provinces, Halle, Erlangen, and a 
number of Saxon, Westphalian, and Ehenish universities were lost. A 
deputation of professors from Halle approached the King at Memel in 
August, 1807, to petition for the transfer of their university to Berlin. 
For political reasons the King felt obliged to refuse the request, but he 
announced his intention of creating a new university at; Berlin, adding 
the celebrated sentiment that what the state had lost in physical forces 
must be replaced by spiritual forces. Accordingly, a cabinet order of 
SeiJtember 4, 1807, decreed " the establishment at Berlin of an insti- 
tution for all branches of learning in suitable connection with the 
Academy of Sciences." 

Berlin at that time was still occupied by the French. A year passed 
before the evacuation on December o, 1808. On December 13 a new 
cabinet was formed, and on February 20, 1809, Wilhelm von Humboldt 
was put at the head of the bureau of education. Now the actual work 
began. A few months later we find the erudite statesman in the far 
East occupied with what he considered his first and foremost duty, the 
preliminaries for the organization of the Berlin University. It was to 
be more, he said, than a merely local institution; by its instrumentality 
"German science was to be given a refuge, the hope of which had 
almost been relinquished." He engaged the services of a number of 



084 FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY. 

distinguished seliolars, secured the privileges for the new institution, 
and procured for it this jiahvce in which we now are, failing to obtain 
only the endowment which he had demanded. On June 14, lSl(),he felt 
impelled to hand in his resignation, but he gave up his office with the 
consciousness of having reached the highest i)ractical success of his 
life. 

At Christmas of 1809 the King left East Prussia, accompanied by 
his family and his councilors. A sorely tried man of 40, he returned 
to the capital whence his ancestors daring four centuries had managed 
the building up of the state, of which little more than the foundations 
remained. He came back to the places that had witnessed the peaceful 
joys of his young married life, and where he had striven to insure his 
people's hapT)iness by training it to the fear of God and to pure moral- 
ity. How changed was all that ! Yet his greatest trial was still to come. 
The King's dearest possession, his beautiful, high-minded wife, his 
solace and comfort in misfortune, who had shared all his sufiering with 
unparalleled courage, was to be torn from his side. The insidious 
disease, whose ravages had long been perceptible, made rapid strides, 
and on July 19, 1810, the (^ueen succumbed. 

The world knows how deeply Frederick AVilliam felt the loss, how his 
whole people sorrowed with him. p]ven at this late day, every beholder 
of the magnificent monument erected by the King in honor of his 
martyr wife is seized with admiration and grief. At the time, the 
remembrance of the Queen's troubles was an added incentive to the 
most strenuous efforts for the deliverance of the country, and so make 
amends, as it were, for the distress inrticted upon the noblest of women. 

A chronological.review of the documents pertaining to the prepara- 
tions for the new university betrays by only a slight gap the occurrence 
of the sad event. In August the negotiations are resumed, the last for 
whicli Wilhelm von Humboldt's counsel was invited. The cabinet order 
a]ipointing the first rector and the deans of the four faculties bears date 
September 28, and on October 10, 1810, the officers elected up to that 
time assembled in the university building. It was a small gathering", 
sixteen persons in all. The proceedings were conducted in a business- 
like manner, without blare of trumpets. It is evident that the troublous 
times weighed on all minds. Perhaps never before nor since has so 
momentous an act, one so long and eagerly awaited, been accomplished 
so quietly and informally. 

Work was begun at once. On October 15 Hufeland, Graefe, and 
Klaproth, and on October 21 Fichte, opened their lecture courses, and 
on October 29, the day originally set, the majority of the professors 
followed suit. Small though the corps of instructors was, it was ener- 
getic and efficient; the brilliancy of their names and achievements com- 
pensate for their restricted numbers. 

It is not our object to-day to enter into further details. Our anni- 
versary celebration rather suggests a general discussion of the results

effected by the new iustitution. To what extent has it fullilled the 
expectations entertained by the King at its establishment? And what 
has been its significance in the development of science! 

Without boastfiilness we may say that its first eftect was to stimulate 
most i)owerful]y the sense of nationality. Its very existence indicated 
that Prussia had not given herself up for lost. Its first years, to be sure, 
witnessed an increase in tfie oppression exercised by alien rule. Napo- 
leon's Russian campaign heightened the misery of the provinces still in 
the possession of Prussia. The exactions levied by the enemy, despite 
his having become an ally, exhausted their last resources. Forced to 
participate in the invasion of Eussia, the Prussian army revolted from 
tbe humiliation of acting as the tool for a stranger's purposes. The 
patriots, and with them the young who had stayed at home, aijplied 
themselves to devise means to shake oft" the yoke of foreign rule. A 
circle of enthusiastic youths gathered about Fi(;hte, who had never 
given up the hope of regeneration, and had begun his inspiring 
addresses to the German nation even before the establishment of the 
university. And when finally, after the disgraceful end of the Russian 
campaign, resistance began to gather force in distant East Prussia; 
when a rising of the whole people came within the range of the possi- 
ble, and resolution won the day in the King's council, then the summons 
to the war of liberation was nowhere obeyed more enthusiastically than 
in the Berlin University circles. Here all was in readiness. Teachers 
and students presented themselves for military service; the memorial 
tablet in this hall records the names of the brave who in 1813 and 1815 
sealed their devotion to their country with death. • So the university 
showed by precept and example what forces spiritual elevation creates 
for the service of the state. 

Slowly the almost deserted lecture rooms filled uj) after peace was 
established, and a still longer time it took our academic youth to real- 
ize that their duty consisted in study and preparation for action, not in 
action itself. Rei^eatedly academic liberty was in imminent danger on 
account of the unbridled desire of individuals to interfere with the 
course of public att'airs. But gradually the conviction that quiet work 
was the real object of study gained ground, and the palladium of aca- 
demic life, namely, liberty of instruction for the teachers and liberty of 
study for the students (Lehrfreiheit und Lernfreiheit), was happily 
rescued from all assaults. 

Along what lines did the actual development of the university pro- 
ceed? Let us briefly review the aims of scholarly research before 1810; 
details are of course out of the question. 

Since the Reformation the jihilosophic faculties had assumed a more 
andmoredominatingpositiouatthe North German universities. Though 
occupying the last place in the hierarchic series, the philosophic fac- 
ulty exercised a determining influence upon the general tendency of the 
studies with regard to method as well as matter. In this department

classical philology and history were represented as well as mathematics 
and a part of the natural sciences; and pliilosophy in the restricted 
sense being added, this faculty gave clearest exin-ession to the uni- 
versality of academic instruction. The philosophic faculty was the 
microcosm, as it were, of the universitas. The other faculties were in 
this way forced into the position of specialty schools ; even the medical 
faculties, though frequently they possessed chairs of chemistry, botany, 
and naturiil history, not wholly escaping this descrij)tion. The more 
sturdily philosophy in the narrow sense of the term developed, the 
more it seemed the center, or in fact the culmination, of scholarly study. 
Its method was adopted as the standard for all branches. 

Philosophy first developed to magnificent proportions in Halle. The 
Elector Frederick III founded the university at Halle in 1094, as also 
the Academy of Arts and of Sciences at Berlin, in order, as he said, to 
"make a human being of man, to cleanse him of the filth of barbarism, 
and give him a home on earth."' In Halle philosophy, for the first time 
on German soil, obtained a preeminent position. Christian Wolf gath- 
ered numerous disciples about him, and they quickly spread the new 
manner all over Germany. Soon, however, he aroused the suspicions 
of the orthodox. An address, " De i^hilosophia Sinensium morale," gave 
the occasion for a cabinet order by Frederick William I, on November 
15, 1723, removing him from his position and punishing him with 
immediate banishment. Thus ended this first j)romising attempt. 
The recall of Wolf by Frederick II in 1710 was unavailing to make 
amends. 

The glory of having secured for philosojjhy a second and long period 
of splendor fell to the share of the University of Kouigsberg, founded 
by Duke Albert of Prussia in 1514, to be the high school of the uu adul- 
terated Lutheran creed. But as early as the time of the great Frederick 
it began to lose its theologic character. Immanuel Kant, who received 
the professorship of logic and metaphysics in 1770, became the accepted 
teacher of central Euroi)e ; through his agency criticism replaced dogma. 
Notwithstanding this, his authority was recognized by the ecclesiasti- 
cal schools; even the Catholic universities in the central provinces of 
Germany sent him students designed to serve as teachers at home. 
The rigidity of his moral system, the absolute validity of the categori- 
cal imperative taught by him, formed the connecting link between two 
views of life diametrically opposed to each other at every other point. 
Frederick William III, who had been interested in Kant's works from 
his crown prince days, and had entered into personal relations with 
him during his East Prussian exile, esteemed at its full value his high 
moral infiuence. Kant's successful career contributed not a little to the 
strengtheningof the hopes cherished in Government circles in connection 
with the establishment of a new university. 

These hopes centered in Fichte, one of Kant's disciples, who in fact 
gtood godfather to our university, and at its very inception impressed

upon it, as it were, his sign manual. It had been his fortune to be 
teacher in Jena at that period of greatest luster, when the poet princes 
inaugurated a new era in literature and a host of excellent scholars 
joined them. Among the younger men pouring in from all sides were 
the brothers Humboldt, who built the bridge across which Fichte 
passed to the northern capital. In 1793 the professorship of i)hilosophy 
was conferred upon him at Jena. This is the first step toward that 
departure in philosophy which, in its essence idealistic, led to "Natur- 
philosophie" and in quick succession transformed one branch of science 
after another on lines of a priori reasoning. Fichte was soon accused of 
atheism, and when a strong and agile antagonist arose in his own camp 
in the person of Sclielling, lie preferred to leave the little town of the 
muses. Frederick William III received him in Berlin, even before the 
university was organized, and so created for him the possibility of 
applying his idealism on the field of practical politics in a way probably 
never before vouchsafed to a philosopher. His fiery zeal, his eloquence, 
his love of liberty, insured an influence, which would certainly have 
become paramount for a long period after the establishment of peace, 
had fate not decreed otherwise. On January 27, 1814, Fichte died of 
typhoid fever, contracted at the bedside of his wife, who had brought 
the infection from the military lazaretto. 

At the instigation of Schleiermacher, Hegel was proposed to the min- 
istry in 1816 as Fichte's successor. Despite the opposing' vote of De 
Wette, who represented that this philosopher's system contradicted 
Christianity and no less the reliable principles of Aristotelian logic, and 
in reality was but a form of " Katurphilosophie," the Government 
offered no objections. But the negotiations were without result on this 
occasion. A little while later, in 1818, the services of the ready dia- 
lectician were secured for Berlin. Everybody awaited his lectures with 
eagerness. The circle of his adherents grew rapidly and annually 
became greater. Soon his influence over the thought and speech of his 
contemporaries had become so decided that Hegelians were to be found 
in every faculty. The Avhole body of science was remodeled by them, 
and their master's terminology was carried to the remotest depths of 
every specialty. When, on November 14, 1831, he succumbed to the 
cholera on its first march through our land, he left a veritable staff of 
drilled disciples who undertook to continue the work in his sj)irit and 
transmit the traditions of his system to future generations. Nothing 
could have seemed more firmly joined than the system of this self- 
centered school. Theology and jurisprudence, political science, and 
a?sthetics all wore the garb of Hegelian language and theory; only in 
medicine and the natural sciences the invasion had confined its depre- 
dations to individual authorities. Although the master was gone, his 
halo remained visible for fully a decade, one may say, up to the death 
of King Frederick William III, whose minister, Altenstein, himself an 
enthusiastic Hegelian, kept the system in power by his favor. But not

one of his disciples i)ossesse(l the creative impulse, nor even the glow- 
ing enthusiasm, which move great circles of men. The i)e(lantic, often 
emi:)ty phrases left as the residue of a great inovement, came to be the 
target of ridicule, as before they had been the object of astonishment 
or even admiration. 

Hegeiianism was the last of the successive i)hilosophic schools that 
grew uj) under the eye of Frederick William III. With "Naturphilos- 
ophie" in its more rigid, or better its more logical, development he did 
not come into direct contact. Its exi)onent, Schelling, first Fichte's dis- 
cii^le, then his rival, finally his successor in Jena, had soon transferred 
his activity to Bavaria; and there he had succeeded, by bold strictures 
on physiology and pathology, m attracting the attention of physicians 
to himself and his system. But the influence which "il^aturphilosophie" 
did indeed obtain in medicine lasted only a short time. So far as 
Berlin is concerned, it might have passed without leaving a trace, had 
Hegel not imported many details from his old friend Schelling into his 
own system. 

It is peculiar that a few decades later, after "I^Iatiirphilosophie" had 
passed its zenith, ten years aftei the <leath of Hegel, immediately after 
that of King Frederick William III, an unexpected turn in affairs 
seemed to hold out to " jSTaturphilosophie" the hope of filling the vacant 
chair of jjliilosophy. Not long after his accession to the throne Fred- 
erick William IV called Schelling to Berlin (1841). The largest lecture 
halls were inadequate to hold the crowds, consisting partly of students, 
partly of numerous representatives of all strata of the cultured, eager 
to hear from his own lips the famous thinker's views, held almost equal 
to a revelation. It soon became evident that, as might have been 
imagined, the aging pliilosopher sought to cover up the weaknesses of 
his system by all sorts of mystic additions and by a correspondingly 
confusing piiraseology, but that in thought he had penetrated neither 
further nor deeper. The attempt to introduce " Naturphilosophie" was 
soon abandoned, and with the author his system vanished from Ber- 
lin; its soil had been prepared, but also exhausted by Hegeiianism. 

A rapid survey of the inner history of our university reveals unmis- 
takably that during the whole time of Frederick William III its devel- 
opment took place, if not entirely, certainly to all outward appearance, 
under the standard of i^hilosophy. Yet this monarch was neither a 
philosopher in the strict sense of the word, nor an enthusiastic admirer 
of philosophy. On this point we have information through his biog- 
rapher, the court preacher, Bishop Eylert, who was in close intercourse 
with him during those years. Biased by his ecclesiastical i^osition, he 
may have made his report one-sided, but there is no reason for doubting 
its truthfulness. 

Eylert says of the King: '■'■ Philosophy as such he did not care for; 
he was not gifted with taste in that direction. In the history of philos- 
ophy, which at least in its general features was not strange to him, he 



FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY. 689 

found nothing to induce liim to cultivate the study. The succession of 
shifting systems which it describes, wherein what has been built up is 
destroyed, what has beenjiraised to the skies is degraded and censured, 
and ideas rejected but now appear in new guises and fresh colors, 
rather had the effect of instilling distrust of hunuin wisdom into him." 
Eylert then describes how the King learned to love Kant : " But when,'' 
the biographer goes on, " after the death of Kant, Fichte raised a new 
system, and the divine homage paid to the former was transferred to 
the latter, who in turn was put into the shade by Sclielling, and the 
members of philosophic dynasties continued to be deposed and enthroned 
in rapid succession until llegel was called to Berlin, the King became 
disgusted. He lost whatever desire he may have had to work his way 
through the labyrinth of ideas, and ceased wholly to take interest." 

It seems, then, that the King sjieedily arrived at the conclusion 
reached on devious paths by the bulk of the cultured, even by the 
learned. It is certain that with the death of Hegel the university was 
forever delivered from the magic spell thrown over it by philosophical 
systems. No philosoi)lier since then has occupied, nor to be Just has 
claimed, an equally authoritative position. But as for the conditions 
prevailing during the reign of Frederick William III no epithet can 
more comprehensively describe them than the expression, ''the philo- 
sophic age." 

A term of that kind is open to misconstruction. We have since then 
had eminent philosophers among our teachers, excellent men, fitted to 
explain to their audiences the nature of i)liilosophy, the laws of thought, 
the method of perceiving and judging, the course and degree of intel- 
lectual development, but hapi)ily not one of them has invented a 
system of philosophy or sought to introduce it into the speech of our 
youth by the agency of artistically constructed phrases. To be sure, a 
strong motive for studying philosophy has thus been removed, for many 
minds are more attracted by what is dark and unintelligible than by 
what is clear and perspicuous. It is possible, too, that after the study 
of a delinite system of philosophy ceased to be the rule, the desire 
to devote study to philosophy in general was permanently impaired. 
Among us teachers it is a recognized fact that the training of many of 
our students in logic and dialectics falls far short of the standard that 
ought to be set up for every academic citizen, indeed for every man of 
education. Therefore we are not wanting in admonitions to our stu- 
dents to make up their serious deficiencies in this direction by their 
own efforts. It is hard to establish since when this lamentable condi- 
tion has existed. The school of "Naturphilosophie," which was pro- 
ductive of a host of faulty methods and invalid conclusions in its very 
exponents, was by its nature ill fitted to discipline students to that 
degree of proficiency in thinking which we at present require. In view 
of De Wette's discovery of a contradiction between the logic of Aristotle 
and that of Hegel seventy-seven years ago, consolation may be derived 
SM9I 44 



690 FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY. 

from the fact that this opposition rarely crops out in the scholars of 
to-day. In the measure in Avhich philosophic systems were pushed 
iuto the background, sober observation and common sense asserted 
themselves. 

King Frederick William III must be classed among the sober-minded. 
It is highly characteristic of him that his intimate biographer begins 
the description of his mental qualities by praising his "sound, natural, 
common sense" as the foundation of his personality. "In a rare 
degree," he writes, "it (common sense) was i^eculiar to the King, so 
that it may be said that his sound, natural, uudistorted good sense pre- 
vailed in all affairs, and always was his helpful companion." There- 
fore he loved nature, and altliough he had not enjoyed a comprehensive 
education in the natural sciences, he was wont to devote attention and 
thought to the phenomena of nature. And in connection with this char- 
acteristic his biographer distinctly and repeatedly gives evidence that 
" his closest confidant, the one who understood and stimulated him, was 
Alexander von Humboldt — the daily mess mate, the constant traveling 
companion, the intimate friend of our never-to-be-forgotten royal 
master." 

Humboldt had also had a "Naturphilosophie" period. In Jena, in 
1795, he devoted much time to the problem then occupying all minds, 
the half naturalistic, half spiritualistic being called vital force. The 
" Rhodian genius," that winsome creation of a naturalist's fancy, which 
he later abandoned with reluctance, will always remain interesting as 
a characteristic picture of the mental confusion from which even the 
best men of the time could not extricate themselves. Curiously, it was 
at that very period that Humboldt, stimulated first by Girtaner's 
investigation of the principle of irritability, and later more particularly 
by the discoveries of Galvani and Volta, was zealously engaged with 
his famous experiments on the growth of plants and on the irritation 
of the nerve and muscle liber, which demonstrated his ability to manip- 
ulate the rigid methods of the scientist. It is touching to read in a 
letter dated Jena, 1797 : " The conviction is growing that these experi- 
ments may sometime or other become the basis of the art of medicine, 
and that I may be founding a new science (vital chemistry)." More and 
more he turned to the empirical observation of nature, and as early as 
1795 he wrote to Blumenbach: "Facts endure when philosophic struc- 
tures hastily erected have long crumbled. I have always kept my facts 
and my theories apart. This way of observing the phenomena of nature 
seems to me most fruitful and thorough." 

Then came his great scientific tour in America, immediately on his 
return, September 3, 1801, Humboldt announced his willingness to 
serve the King. Frederick William received him with great distinction, 
and generously supplied him with the means for continuing liis work. 
In the capacity of companion to Prince William he was sent to Paris in 
1808, where he remained even after the discharge of his political mission, 



FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY. 691 

until 1826, enjoying intimate intercourse witli the first scientists of the 
century. Here he completed not only his equipment as a scientific 
investigator, but also his general philosophic development. In 1827 he 
took up his permanent abode in Prussia, and then began his close 
relation to the King, to whom he became a friend and counselor. For 
our university his return definitely marked the transition to the time 
of the natural sciences. 

It were unjust to attribute this change to Humboldt alone. Long 
before his return, a solid phalanx of genuine scientists had gathered 
in Berlin. The Academy of Sciences and the Collegium Medico-Chi- 
rurgicum included most efficient men among its members. The latter 
institution indeed, even before the establishment of the university, 
was so fully equipped with scientific instructors and facilities for the 
study of the sciences, that it was worthy of being ranked with a regular 
medical faculty. This fact explains why the medical faculty of the 
newly organized university at first had the greatest nnmber of students. 
There were besides other institutions, each with its corps of scholars, 
among them the Botanical Gardens, the Observatory, and the Library. 

After all, these institutions were inadequately, in fact meanly, fitted 
out, and it required the benevolence of the King and the enduring 
interest of the ministers to develop and perfect them so as to make' 
them accord with modern views and enable them to bear comparison with 
those of other States. New positions, new opportunities for work, had 
to be created, and Alexander von Humboldt was ever ready to give 
help in that respect. He may be considered the guardian angel of 
the natural sciences in the time of Frederick William III, and even after 
his death. His extensive culture, vast memory, and numerous con- 
nections enabled him to understand persons and things thoroughly and 
judge them without bias, while his unprejudiced, upright character 
guaranteed the impartial use of his influence, no matter to what calling, 
what nation, or creed his protege might belong. Humboldt was the 
confidant not only of the scientist, but of every scholar, though the 
former was naturally most strongly attracted to him. 

So it happened that as early as 1828 we find liim presiding over the 
association of German scientists and physicians, which at that time, a 
few years after its formation, held its first meeting in Berlin. If this 
association, which brought together the representatives of all depart- 
ments of the natural sciences for i)ersonal acquaintance and the inter- 
cliange of ideas, came to exert great and lasting influence upon the 
development of scientific culture in Germany, then it owes this position 
not a little to the personal interest of Humboldt. With the Berlin 
meeting began the heightened activity which has made the Association 
of Scientists the most popular and most numerously attended of all the 
associations without a fixed seat. The attendance of the foremost 
scholars, even from foreign countries, invested its proceedings with 
decisive authority in the dissemination of improved methods, in pro-

motiiij;' tlie general spread of new diseoveries, and especially in com- 
pelling tln> esteem of (lovernnient circles. The circumstance that 
Frederick William III himself ai)peared at a social reunion of the 
scientists was an evidence of telling success. 

Humboldt was at that period busily urging the erection of a new 
observatory nt Berlin. The old tower in Dorotheenstrasse, which had 
long served for astronomical observations, was inadequate for the 
subtler problems of science, now that astronomy had aims beyond the 
computation of the calendar. Frederick William Til, who had had the 
new observatory at Konigsberg built in days of most grievous distress, 
and had been made cognizant by Bessel of the importance of the celes- 
tial science, yielded to the solicitations of his experienced counselor. 
He granted funds for more perfect instruments, and soon afterwards for 
the building of the new observatory. 

Tliis grant inaugurated the new period of royal activity, which since 
then has made addition after addition to the scientific institutes at the 
ca])ital. Some institutions of the kind had existed before. The need of 
a better corps for the medical care of soldiers had led to the establish- 
ment of an anatomical amphitheater in 1713; the Academy of Sciences 
had fitted up a chemical laboratory in its house on Dorotheenstrasse 
under Frederick the Great; the flower and vegetable gardens laid out 
in Dutch fashion by the Great Elector had gradually developed into the 
Botanical Gardens, so meanly furnished, to be sure, that Frederick 
William 111 had to be at great expense to remodel them comi^letely in 
1801. 

On all sides the conviction was evidently taking root that the natural 
sciences can be understood only by the observation of nature herself, 
and that the effective combination of science and tangible objects 
requires provisions on a large scale, such as can be afforded by museums, 
collections, laboratories, institutes. This conviction became particularly 
strong when it was realized that experimentation is the most important 
means of forcing nature to reveal the essence, causes, and development 
of a phenomenon. From the closet of the philosophers no valid expla- 
nation of the facts of nature had proceeded. Since belief in magic 
formulas survived only in the lowest strata of the people, tlie formulas 
of "nature philosophers" found as little contidence. 

Frederick William III and his ministers, to a great extent from finan- 
cial reasons, confined their assistance in the transformation of scu'utific 
institutes to individual cases and to the sporadic betterment of the 
worst abuses. A definite attitude, assumed under the guidance of fixed 
principles, was never reached. Also, Frederick William IV gave more 
attention to the art academies than to the scientific institutions, and it 
was only a chain of fortunate circumstances that brought about in 185G, 
the latter ])art of his reign, the erection of the new Pathologic Institute, 
the first of its kind in the world. 

Luckily it was not long before similar institutions for other branches 



FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY. 693 

were founded, most of tlieiii on a much more magniticent scale. Under 
Emperor William arose the palaces of the Physiologic and the Physical 
Institute; the Chemical Institute was completely remodeled and an 
additional building erected, together with a pharmaceutical institute; 
then followed two anatomical institutes, the great Museum of ISTatural 
History, with the Zoologic Institute, the Hygienic Institute — in shorty 
in the course of a few decades so large a number of buildings was 
erected that at present not one of the experimental sciences is left with- 
out a home of its own in Berlin, or without the instruments necessary 
for successful research. Xor have the institutions for the sick been 
neglected, the less so as the municipal authorities, in praiseworthy 
emulation of the example set by the Government, have erected hospitals, 
each with more perfect appointments than the last. 

"Thus," to cite the expression used by one of the most famous expo- 
nents of physical science, our recently departed friend, Siemens, at the 
second Berlin meeting of the Association of Scientists, "we have 
stepped into the age of the natural sciences." Nowadays the scholar is 
called upon to be an investigator, and the demands made upon instruc- 
tion have increased to so great an extent that the academic course of 
studies is arranged with a view not only of initiating the student into 
the methods of investigation, but also of affording him the opportunity 
of practicing them. There is no longer need to i^rove the usefulness of 
this sort of science. Every member of the nation is aware of tlie i)rotit 
that accrues to the State and to society from the new institutions. 
Bacon's old dictum, scientia est potentia, has become truth. 

Surely the retrospect upon the career of our university, viewed from 
the heiglit of its present stage of development, is elevating — we may 
tell ourselves that eighty years have sufticed to jiroduce a complete 
revolution in science and instruction. He who has contributed even a 
mite to this consummation may look back upon his work with deep satis- 
faction. But it were folly to believe that we have nothing more to 
investigate, that we are proof against new dangers. Not even the 
old ones are entirely removed. Perhaps the so called exact natural 
sciences, physics and chemistry, will enjoy immunity for a long time to 
come, inasmuch as in them we have reached a perception of the unity 
of the forces of nature, instead of regarding them as separate agencies. 
But that great host of sciences whose essential theme is life and its 
mysteries — biology in all its ramitications — is by no means unassail- 
able, and it is precisely in this quarter that mysticism has always made 
its most redoubtable encroachments. 

It took long for life, as such, to be recognized in the light of a study. 
The beginning of its rational observation arose not more than two hun- 
dred years ago, and of these two centuries more than three quarters 
were used up in refuting the doctrine of vital force as a i)eculiar StvauiS 
of a more or less spiritual nature. Only since we know that life means 
cell activity, and since we can see the living being in the cell and force 



694 FOUNDING OF THE BERLIN UNIVERSITY. 

it to submit to experimentation — knowledge which the worhl owes 
primarily to our own Johannes Mliller and his school — no one speaks 
of vital force. But this knowledge does not finally solve the question 
about the nature of life any more than the question about the nature 
of the human mind is answered by the proof that mental activity is 
connected with nerve substance. And so long as these are open ques- 
tions, so long the gates are not closed to mysticism. 

With regard to this fear, nothing is more instructive than the pro- 
ceedings of the medical faculty, since 1812, on the establishment of a 
professorship of animal magnetism. When a considerable number of 
petitioners, among them sensible physicians, entreated the appointment 
of a professor of this branch, the minister of state, Von Schuckmann, 
said that, convenient though it might be to absorb wisdom during 
sleep, he could never consent to the employment of a master of the art, 
because his common sense taught him to consider it jugglery. The 
medical faculty and the department of medicine were also opposed 
thereto. A few years later the chancellor. Von Hardenberg, expressed 
the urgent wish to advance Wolfart and Koreff", the chief representa- 
tives of animal magnetism, and curiously enough Wilhelm von Hum- 
boldt seconded the proposition. So it happened that by a royal cabinet 
order the two men were made professors. This was in 1816 and 1817. 

In more recent times animal magnetism has been replaced by spirit- 
ism, and at present hypnotism is making tremendous exertions to dis- 
lodge it and rise to the rank of a recognized science. It is a conflict like 
that with homeopathy. Will science succeed in warding oft" the danger, 
and will the Government remain strong enough to keep the paths of 
science free from obstructions? 

Our time, so sure of itself and of victory by reason of its scientific 
cansciousness, is as apt as former ages to underestimate the strength 
of the mystic impulses with which the soul of the nation is infected by 
single adventurers. Even now it is standing bafHed before the enigma 
of anti-Semitism, whose appearance in this time of the equality of rights 
is inexplicable to everybody, yet which, in spite of its mysteriousuess, 
or perhaps on account of it, fascinates even our cultured youth. Up to 
the present moment the demand for a professorship of anti-Semitism 
has not made itself heard; but rumor has it that there are anti-Semitic 
professors. He who knows the "JSTaturphilosophie" in all its minute 
branchings is not astonished at such phenomena. The human mind is 
only too prone to leave the diflflcult path of well-ordered thinking and 
to indulge in fanciful musing. Such aberrations can be counteracted, 
to speak with Schuckmann, only by sound common sense; and he who 
has lost good sense through a perverted education can rescue himself 
only by rigorous empiric work. There is nothing for it but to learn 
and get accnstomed to explain the unknown from the vantage ground 
of the known, instead of choosing as the premise for fantastic deduc- 
tions the dark and the unknown, as though they were new truths. The

natural sciences owe their triumi)bant career to tlieir loyal clinging to 
actual knowledge, whence they pierced the darkness of unexplored 
regions. The first aim always was to search out the old law in new 
phenomena and so link them with the old ones. He who hopes to find 
a new law in every exception is no better off than he who sees a miracle 
in every exception. 

And, as in the intellectual world, so it is in the moral world. The 
impulse to do the good and act uprightly rests upon the inner satisfac- 
tion experienced when we perform an action in accord with human 
nature, reason, and the reciprocal duties of men. The satisfaction 
becomes the greater if in its performance we offer resistance to the 
suggestions of passion, personal interest, or worldly advantage. Is a 
positive creed or a compelling obligation necessary for this? Is there 
not a moral law proceeding from our inner nature which urges us to be 
true and to act nobly witliout human statute? Was Kant's categorical 
imijerative naught but a philosophic formula ? To be sure, there is a 
moral education which teaches and strengthens the habit of acting 
justly and avoiding wrong — true moralit}^ — but in point of fact no 
education can create the moral impulse where it does not exist. There- 
fore our academic discipline leaves to students a certain measure of 
personal liberty, which their feeling of responsibility grants them with- 
out restriction, and which permits them to develop independently, 
according to the bent of their minds. They are not bound down to 
certain religious ceremonies; they are given no ethical code created 
specially for them. What we expect and demand of them now, as in 
former days, is the free development of a self-centered, honest, wholly 
fine personality. May this aim be aspired to by all that come to us; 
may it be reached by a goodly number ! Then will the hope wherewith 
King Frederick William III founded and cherished this university be 
fulfilled. 



THE IN^STITUTE OF FKA:N^CE m 1894. 



By M. LoEWY, 

rresident of the French Academy of Sciences and FiesidenI of the Institute. 



Gentlemen: It is on the eve of an anniversary that tlie mind 
seems to me best disposed to yield to those reflections wliich every 
great commemoration naturally evokes in us. On the day of tlie cele- 
bration itself, we are apt to be overcome by the brilliancy of the solemn 
occasion and the enthusiasm of thenioment. Since, then, custom bidsme 
celebrate by a direct address to its members the foundation of the Insti- 
tute, wbicli will next year attain its completed century, this seems tome 
a fit occasion to consider not what lias so often been admired in you — the 
picturesque variety, if I may venture to call it so, of the talents wliich com- 
pose each one of the academies and their totality — but rather the close 
union which binds into one great whole all the works of the mind, for in 
this solidarity I see the true reason for the existence of your society ; this 
is its true principle, this is its true life. Such was also, as you well know, 
the feeling of the convention Avhen it converted our previously isolated 
classes into one great whole. This creation realized the idea that the 
men of that period had formed of the human mind in its rich unity. 
It also realized the dream of a model republic, in which the autonomy 
of admission and the perfect liberty of individual efforts, so far from 
impeding rather secure that harmonious concert of action where even 
tradition results in progress. On that day was born the ''living ency- 
clopedia," which so justly deserves its name. Like the other written 
work, it was fit that this also should see the light on French soil, and if 
such an example is unique in the world's history, it will create no sur- 
prise to see that it is set by France, the home of liberal initiative, the 
laud in which even the language seems to be the offspring of good 
sense. Time has shown that this bold foresight, one of the last acts of 
the eighteenth century, was by no means Utopian. The powerful vitality 
of the institute is the strongest argument in favor of a brotherhood in 
the ideal of sciences, arts, and letters. As the part it plays in the moral 
and intellectual development of the nation is continually becoming

698 THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894. 

more important, tliis incessant activity bears evidence to the liigh 
prestige which it enjoys throughout the civilized worhl. 

Not only the history of the institute, but also our personal experi- 
ence and careful reflection, teach us every day the advantages of our 
life in common. However different the tasks may be which the live 
academies consider their special functions, the supreme aim of all your 
efforts remains the same. You seek for truth in all its aspects, for the 
beautiful in all its forms; you strive to inspire man with a clearer con- 
sciousness of his ability to improve. In order to attain this end, we 
all and everywhere employ the same means; the methods we employ 
all have but one and the same priucij)le — to observe and to analyze all 
the facts in nature and to combine them upon a basis of the unchange- 
able rules of reason. The arts appeal perhaps to a logic somewhat less 
severe, but by no means less rigorous, than that employed for algebra. 

The beautiful, the ideal representative of truth, can not perish any 
more than the latter; hence it is subject to laws that are as much above 
discussion as those which govern science. The plan for a masterpiece 
of architecture, the composition of a beautiful symphony, may be ana- 
lyzed with nearly as much j)recision as a geometrical problem. 

The sciences, for their part, never begin and never progress without, 
as Bacon says, Ijringing man and nature nearer to each other; the sys- 
.tem of the world in its scientific aspect is probably the most beautiful 
of all works of art. While science and art define the just limits of our 
powers, they also make us better aware of their extent and their bound- 
ary lines. Both of them finally, with all their kindred — literature, his- 
tory, philosophy — teach man the same lesson of hard work, in which he 
is sustained by his faith in the ideal, and fill him with the consciousness 
of the lofty mission intrusted to his mind. 

In proportion as progress is secured and accumulates in the vast 
domain of human activity, the identity of the ends pursued and the 
inevitable connection between the eftbrts made to reach them become 
daily more marked; the study of the great problems of nature and of 
life help us to comi)rehend better the marvelous harmony that rules all 
creation; in the boundless space that surrounds us, all created bodies, 
from the most minute atom to the grandest of all constellations, influ- 
ence one another in some way, and their reciprocal action is subject to 
eternal laws; all natural forces are preserved, binding the infinitely 
small and the infinitely great to each other; new worlds arise, others 
pass away, and from one evolution to anotlier the universe advances in 
perfect order toward a mysterious destiny, and we are more and more 
struck by tlie admirable relations which all parts of this infinitely 
complex creation entertain to each other. 

At every instant some close, unthought of, connection between 
the most varied branches of science and art is brought to light. 
Who could have thought fifty years ago of the remarkably fruit- 
ful intervention of physics and chemistry in astronomy, a science 



THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894. 699 

wliicli iiji to tliat time seemed to be of a purely' matliematieal nature? 
^/Vbo could Lave imagined that astronomers were to lind in pliotograpliy 
and spectroscopy their most j^owerfiil means of investigation; that 
by analyzing with their aid the luminous rays, the only messengers 
through whom we are in direct communication with the stars, we 
could arrive at positive conclusions in regard to the physical condition 
of the celestial bodies, the distance which separates them from us, 
their rotation, their nascent state, the present i^eriod of their stellar 
life, and their wane? What a triumph for natural philosophy to be 
able to assert that the innumerable bodies in the canopy of heaven con- 
tain the same material elements as our globe! 

In ascertaining the truly marvelous fact that a single luminous wave 
sprung from a star is enough to convey such intimate and varied 
knowledge, we can not help being seized with profound admiration for 
the sublime arrangement which holds and unites all things together in 
a perfect and inseparable whole. And this communication, no less sur- 
jjrising than accurate, which modern science has succeeded in estab- 
lishing with the most remote of the heavenly worlds, inspires us with 
confidence in the constantly progressive advance of human intellectual 
power. 

Unforeseen prospects are again spread out before us. We may already 
dimly perceive the solution of the momentous problems relative to the 
medium and to the mode of transmission of i)hysical forces. It may also 
be that we are nearer than we think to acquiring precise notions of 
that primordial substance from which come all those elementary bodies 
that constitute the material Universe. 

We are thus led to the extreme boundaries of the knowable, to the 
threshold of the great mysteries which it seems human curiosity will 
never be allowed to penetrate. As was said by one of the greatest think- 
ers that have honored our comprny, Ernest Kenan, " it is here that our 
reason collapses; that all science stands still; that analogy is dumb. 
The antinomies of Kant, an insuperable barrier, loom before us." 

This enigmatic unity of origin of all the substances that fill space 
would at once explain the connection shown by study to exist among 
the phenomena that seem to be most independent, and the inevitable 
concatenation of all the sciences whose subject is nature. 

But instances of so deep an interpenetration are not found in the 
physical sciences alone. The close relations to one another of all the 
operations of the mind become every day more apparent and numerous. 
As we now know, the necessary preparation for successful application 
to historical and archaeological studies comprise a knowledge of the cli- 
mate, of the structure, and successive evolutions of the soil on which 
the human races have developed, and all the traces that these races 
have left behind on their passage must be rigidly investigated. 

The necessity of universal knowledge asserts itself on every occasion. 
It was again evidenced in one of our quarterly meetings, when one of 



700 THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894. 

our colleagues laid before us, with admirable clearness, liis manifold 
investigations of a curious question in history. 

This, then, is the time when, more than ever before, we must yield 
to the exigericy of participating in the general productions of intellec- 
tual activity, to the need of universal cultivation of the mind. 

But, on the other hand, the inevitable eflect of this condition of things 
is that at no time was so desirable a requirement so difficult to till. 
We are no longer living in a period when eminent minds might believe 
it iiossible to embrace the whole of human knowledge. Neither do I go 
so far back as tlie century in which Leonardo da Viuci was at once the 
representative of poetry, fine arts, mathematical and natural sciences. 
I merely refer to the times of Cuvier, of Arago, and of Humboldt, when 
a poet could, without being charged with temerity, have pretensions to 
scientific attainments and even make a lasting record, as Goethe did, 
in natural history. 

At the present time the repeated and prodigious conquests of science 
and the general advance of ideas have imposed entirely novel condi- 
tions of labor on the human mind. 

The grandeur, variety, and number of the discoveries that have been 
achieved in the latter half of this century suggest the statement that 
it offsets all that was done in preceding ages. 

Innumerable ways are now laid open before intellectual activity. On 
the one hand it will henceforth be impossible to ascribe any limits to 
the fields of investigation in the sciences of the past, and on the other 
hand we are now supplied with methods of wonderful accuracy and 
power for observing and analyzing the most impressive phenomena as 
well as the most minute manifestations of nature, whose secrets we are 
thus more and more enabled to penetrate. 

But each discovery evokes further and manifold revelations, and iudi 
vidua! investigators are overwhelmed in the presence of new horizons 
that spread out before them. However extensive the faculties may be, 
the efforts must be confined and action concentrated on a limited field of 
study, as are those of the plowman working a fertile fallow land of Vast 
exi)anse. 

How many of the scientific men of our day could fairly assert that 
they have been able to master in all its recesses the science that they 
l^ursue? 

We are then confronted by a condition which is apparently bound to 
grow unavoidably worse and seriously to hamper the soaring of human 
exertion. 

Should we conclude, as some interpreters of Buffon's saying have 
done, that genius in the future will be nothing else than long patience? 
We do not believe it. 

Our common life helps us out of the dilemma, as far as it is possible. 
It enables us to acquaint ourselves at once with all new attainments 
and to turn them to advantage. It draws every mind out of the par- 



THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894. 701 

ticular si)liere witliiu which it wouhl be prone to confine itself, and in an 
enhirged expanse it aifords glimpses over the whole domain of thought. 

It is this common life, in Tvhich each of us aims at borrowing from 
his neighbor his commendable qualities, that made us fond of express- 
ing ourselves with clearness and logic; this is one of the causes of our 
originality, and may have been noticed not only among writers but also 
among scientific men. 

Nor is this all : There is a consensus of opinion that great discoveries 
or lofty conceptions are stamped with a reflective logic, which keeps 
imagination within bounds, protects the scientific man from wild 
hypotheses, the artist and writer from false ])rinciples and errors of 
taste. This character of high imi>ersonality, of prudent wisdom, whose 
disregard is one of the failings of our contemporaries, is found to exist 
in your assembly in a conspicuous degree, for yours is in that respect a 
privileged assembly. 

Indeed all these investigations conducted by you in every direction 
and by every method must be harmonious, since they are the result of 
the same efforts, converge toward the same goal, and express the whole 
of human thought. By this constant collaboration you are the most 
vivid light of intellectual life. By its pure and brilliant rays you see 
the close solidarity of your endeavors ; you constantly have before your 
eyes the ideal plan under which they are united and utilized for the 
better advantage of the work in which all the ages of humanity have 
participated — the progress of civilization. You obtain a better grasp 
of its main lines, you make more steady progress in the discovery of 
truth, and, with the assistance of all the noble qualities inherent in 
national characteristics, you climb with a firm step the luminous heights 
toward which we are driven by our destiny on earth. 

In fine, while it can not be gainsaid that so great a number of wonder- 
ful results, of bold doctrines, of sublime conceptions, has stirred to its 
very depth the mind of our age, and has imparted to the spirit of criti- 
cism a disquieting acuteness, this is the place where we are to look for 
a brake and a regulator to api^ly to the wanderings of mysticism and 
skepticism, of which the one gives all up to rash imagination and the 
other brings all under barren animadversion. 

"You will preserve for the most ideal manifestations of the mind, for 
art and for literature, the glorious traditions of the past. 

You will push aside those morbid productions, those arbitrary specu- 
lations that do not rest on the true reality of nature and of moral life, 
and which, instead of touching the soul with the spark of enthusiasm, 
pervade it with delusive bitterness. 

It shall always be your pride that profound good sense, superior 
logic, which confer on our country its first title to glory in the history 
of civilization, can be said to be a sacred trust over which the Institute 
of France watches with pious care. 

In the course of this plenary sitting, a symbol of the effective union 



702 THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894. 

which now binds all the academies in common aspirations, onr thoughts 
naturally revert to those whose death has left among us recent and 
lamented vacancies. It is our reverent duty, and it fills our heart with 
inward satisfaction, to give them a heartfelt remembrance by recalling 
in a few words the works and the accomplishments of our late col- 
leagues whom death, alas, has taken from us in the course of the year. 
The Academy of Sciences has suffered most. The list of our losses 
is headed by a member of the section of rural economy, M. Cham- 
brelent. Our lamented colleague, whose zealous activity continued to 
the last hour of his life, combined the highest knowledge of engineer- 
ing with all the <iualities of these daring pioneers of civilization, who 
undertake a struggle with the forces of nature and often discover in 
those blind and apparently dreadful agents fresh elements of fertility 
for the soil and of comfort for the people. A great part of his life was 
devoted to works of that kind, such as the erection of protecting dams 
in the Camargue, so frecpiently laid waste by the waves of the sea, the 
removal of torrents in the Alps, the protection of forests against fire, 
the digging of canals. But his chief performance, for which his mem- 
ory will endure forever in the agricultural history of our country, was 
the reclaiming and replanting of the Landes. Nearly the whole of 
the vast territory, covering nearly 1,975,000 acres, which lies between 
the Bay of Biscay and the valleys of the Garonne and the Adour, had 
been for centuries unfit for cultivation and proof against civilization. 
In that immense desert, covered in winter with stagnant and noxious 
water, none but a lew wandering shepherds, doomed victims of fever 
and destitution, were ever seen. 

A few cases, widely separated, were the only excei^tions. Chambre- 
lent engaged in a i^ersevering investigation of the causes which had 
allowed a few favored spots to overcome the natural barrenness of the 
soil. He had no sooner begun active service in the corps of pouts and 
chaussees (bridges and causeways) than he found the most simi)le and 
cheapest solution of that great problem. But the remainder of his life 
was spent in securing its application. It was no easy task, and Cliam- 
brelent had to fight manifold obstacles. The incredulity of the inhabit- 
ants whose faith had been blighted by the failure of preceding attemi^ts, 
the spirit of reluctance in more enlightened circles, the mistrust an<l 
indolence which were opposed to his schemes bj^ the executive author- 
ities, all this seemed likely to subdue the most powerful will, the most 
indomitable perseverance. But nothing could shake the robust faith 
of this remarkable man, whose modest and affable manner concealed a 
manly and energetic soul. 

Forsaken by all, Chambrelent resolved to teach the lesson of example 
and to furnish, at his own expense, an irrefutable demonstration. lie 
purchased an extensive portion of land in one of the most desolate spots 
of the country. In a few years the application of his device, so siinj)le 
and so easy of execution, was crowned with signal success ; that barren 



THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894. 703 

soil was gradually covered witli woods and harvests. The aspect of the 
Landes will be transformed from the day when the methods of our 
lamented colleague shall be applied to the whole of that region, and 
the name of Landes will subsist only as a vestige of the past, but the 
memory of Chambrelent shall live through the ages in the hearts of the 
people, for whom he shall have proved one of their greatest benefactors. 

No less severe for us was the loss of Edouard Fremy, who died at 
the age of 80, at the Museum, in the glorious scientific establishment 
the management of which had taken up a portion of his life and whose 
increased attractions were so largely due to his efibrts. His uncommon 
faculty of investigation had placed him among the masters of chemis- 
try, with every branch of which he became conversant. His numerous 
discoveries, especially in regard to industrial ai)plications of chemistry, 
have bestowed upon him a lasting claim to the gratitude of the scien- 
tific world. Countless is the number of distinguished pupils who were 
formed under his teaching and of the investigators who frequented his 
laboratory to advantage in the forty years during which he occupied a 
foremost rank in French science. 

Our colleague was denied the satisfaction of bringing to an end the 
publication of the " Encyclopedic Chimique," a monumental work, 
which he undertook in common with several of our members. The 
overwhelming fatigues of a long life wholly devoted to work had in 
recent years weakened the springs of his activity and cast a sort of 
shadow over his once bright mind. But his image still stands before 
our eyes as that of a man of profound observation, a sharp and clear 
intellect, and a high character, which won him universal regard. 

A month later we followed to his last resting place an honorary 
academician especially lamented by his colleagues. General Fave, a 
highly distinguished officer, who, while he was nobly attending to his 
duties as a soldier, gave constant and fruitful attention to the arts of 
war. He wrote many papers on history and strategy, and achieved 
reputation by his numerous inventions, highly valuable for the national 
defense. Ko one could come in contact with General Fave without 
being impressed with the high cultivation of his mind, which, with his 
affable disposition and his exquisite courtesy, gave him a genuine fas- 
cination. 

A i^hysician has also gone from our midst. We shall cherish the 
memory of Brown- Sequard as one of the most original and interesting- 
characters of our age, a deep thinker and bold investigator. That illus- 
strious physiologist had won fame by works of the highest order long 
before his name became so universally known through the last and most 
curious of his efforts. His capacity for production was extraordinary. 
Always bent on the pursuit of new truths, he was obliged at times to 
defer the final demonstration of his general views, which thus appeared 
in the light of actual divination. 

He was lavish of his energies, and even of his life, when it was a ques- 



704 THE INSTITUTE OY FRANCE IN 1894. 

tiou of tnorouglily testing a scientific proposition, and wlien blood was 
required in liis latest experiments lirowuSecpiard took his own. His 
professional courage, carried to the point of hardihood, was well known. 
Down to his last day his body bore the indelible marks left by experi- 
ments which he had voluntarily undergone. 

In the iutellectual arena Browu-Sequard was one of the most fearless 
champions. The endless array of scientific facts he has brought to 
light and his surprisingly bold views have been the cause of passionate 
debates and the origin of ardent enthusiasms. The scientific movement 
thus started by him is an extensive one, and his many pupils, some of 
whom have in their turn become masters, Avill for a long time to come 
find material for deep reflection in his works. 

One of the most sudden losses sustained by the Academy of Sciences 
during the year is beyond doubt the death of Ernest Mallard. His 
engineering labors engrossed all his attention for many years, and he 
could not, until late, enter the path of scientific research. It took but 
a few years to place him above the ordinary level. His efforts have put 
a new phase on crystallography and reduced to simple and general laws 
a large number of facts for which no explanation had yet been found. 
Mallard would have been justified in devoting his whole tinie to these 
si)eculative studies which were so prolific of felicitous results. Con- 
siderations of interest and humanity frequently interfered. Down to 
his last day he followed up technical experiments on fire damp and 
ex[)losive matters, at the cost of unceasing labor and danger. He 
thought he could not i)ut his high mental faculties to better use than 
by working for the better safety of the lowly miners. 

The death of the celebrated German physicist, Ilelmlioltz, which 
occurred in the mouth of September, has brought to us especial grief. 
The Academy of Sciences witnesses in his demise the disapi»earance 
of one of its most genial associates, one of the most illustrious men of 
the times. He first became known for his important physiological 
investigations; but the prolific work accomplished by him in the 
course of half a century embraces the whole domain of physical and 
nuithematical sciences, and has had far-reaching consequences. Helm- 
holtz was a veritable originator; his researches m geometry, his dis- 
coveries in optics, acoustics and physiology liave secured invaluable 
coiHpiests for science; it would be hard to say on which of those sci- 
ences his genius cast the most brilliant light. 

Even among the most favored nations men gifted with so powerful 
iutellectual faculties appear but rarely in the course of several gen- 
erations. It is by reason of their majestic isolation that they exert a 
dominating influence upon the civilization of their country. Helmholtz 
maintained the most intimate intercourse with French savants through- 
out his life. The universal cultivation of his mind, the elevation of his 
thoughts, the nobleness of his heart won for him here the most sincere 
friends. To our admiration for his genius Avas sui)eradded the regard 
bred by the qualities of his fine nature. 



THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894. 705 

The arcliipology of France lias lost M. Waddiugton, who was in his 
early days elected a uieiuber of the Academy of Inscriptions in recog- 
nition of the long years he had devoted as a zealous numismatist, an 
inquisitive and learned explorer, to those auxiliary sciences which have 
completely renovated historical methods. The epigraphy of Asia Minor 
is indebted to him for investigations that have opened and paved the 
way for further advancement. Waddiugton was drawn away from his 
favorite studies by the high public offices he was called upon to till, at 
first at home and then abroad, in the service of the country. But it 
would ill become science to grieve over his temporary exile, for his keen 
and liberal mind knew how to turn to advantage his versatile attain- 
ments in the important positions he filled. Alike moderate and firm, 
be was enabled to carry through a series of usefnl reforms in public 
instruction, and the influence which these reforms are calculated to 
exert will be lasting and beneficent. Our colleague had returned to 
the study of arclueology when death robbed science and the academy of 
the fruitful investigations which we were still justified in expecting. 

The Academic des Inscrii)tions et Belles-Lettres has also had the 
deep sorrow of losing two of its most renowned foreign associates. Sir 
Henry Layard, a descendant of an ancient family of French emigrants, 
died at Venice on the 20th of July. As a traveler, politician, ambassa- 
dor, he gave, in the most varied pursuits, evidence of high intellectual 
capacity, and left in many parts of the globe the marks of a tenacious 
and productive activity. The memorable expedition to which science 
is indebted for so many magnificent monuments of Assj'riau antiquity 
was successfully led by him through manifold dangers. After landing* 
on the left bank of the Tigris he hired a comi^any of nomad Arabs, 
and was happily moved to begin excavations in the neighborhood of a 
village bearing the suggestive name of Nimroud. It was soon ascer- 
tained that the site of ancient Calah had been discovered. A number 
of low-reliefs, sepulchers, and inscriptions were thus again brought to 
light, thanks to Layard's bold initiative. The discoveries that were 
made later at Kouyundjik, added to those of our fellow-countryman, 
Botta, have thrown an unsuspected light on the history of that remote 
antiquity, and have secured for their authors a well-deserved and 
lasting fame. 

The recent announcement of the death of Commandeur J.B. deRoss, 
has brought us special sorrow. In him we lose not only a celebrated 
savant, but also a sincere and devoted friend of our country. The 
members of the French school at Rome never called in vain upon him 
for information and support. He evidenced his good will toward them 
by continuous services, and his reliable learning by precious indications 
for their work. We had, in a manner, the first fruits of his talent, for 
it was at Paris that his first papers were printed. He first became 
known for remarkable epigra[)hic investigations, but his chief title to 
fame lies in the discovery of that portion of the Catacombs of Rome 
SM 04 45 



706 THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894, 

that is most extensive and richest in memories. It was there that 
he fonnd the materials for his monumental compilation of Christian 
inscrii)tions, in which he resurrects an epoch and a society in which we 
take the liveliest interest. On these publications so fraught with usefnl 
information, important discoveries and valuable analysis, I)e Kossi 
set the first scientific foundation of Christian archaeology. But I must 
desist, regretting my inability to follow in all its manifestations his 
comprehensive genius, and his eminent mind adorned by the most noble 
virtues. 

The Academy of Fine Arts has also had its share of mourning. It 
was bereft, toward the end of January, of one of its oldest members, 
M. Cavelier. Upon Ids leaving thfe Villa Medicis, the young sculptor 
first gained celebrity by a statue of Penelope, a charming work which 
at once revealed a substantial talent and that soundness of taste which 
has ever since characterized the long list of his works. 

Our colleague held with immovable conviction throughout his life to 
the noble conception he had formed of art and of its mission. While 
an eclectic in the manner of execution, he endeavored always to repre- 
sent nature under its most ideal form in a classic style. Cavelier has 
left among his friends, his many pupils, and all those he had favored, 
the memory of a distinguished artist, of a kind master, and of a devoted 
colleague. His name, inscribed on many a sculptural composition by 
which our public buildings are adorned, is assured of going down to 
posterity, and of being cited as one of those that have reflected honor 
and brilliancy upon French art. 

Federico Madrazo, the painter, whose recent death was a national 
bereavement for Spain, was doubly ours, as a foreign associate and as 
an artist trained in the school of the great masters who, in the first 
half of the century, won glory for our country. France was the cradle 
of his new-born talent; it was in our annual salons that he won the 
awards by which fame was brought to his name. His historical pictures, 
and chiefly his admirable portraits that embellish the finest galleries in 
Europe, are the highest vindication of the honors which, at home as well 
as abroad, crowned his long and glorious career. 

The French Academy was no more spared than that of the Fine Arts. 
The death of M. Maxime du Camp has taken from the world of letters 
and of inquiry an indefatigable worker, a refined writer, a vigorous 
and honest polemist. Maxime du Camji leaves behind him extensive 
and manifold works. The marks of the romantic youth of a tra\eler 
and soldier are found in his first productions. But even during that 
period of juvenile enthusiasm his exuberant nature knew how to sub- 
mit to the delays of patient study. Maxime du Camp thus betokened 
the eminent qualities that were to make the latter part of his life as a 
writer illustrious. His great production on Paris, a city which, like 
Montaigne, he loved down to its warts and blemishes, shows most 
admirably his ability as an investigator and philosopher always equal

to his subject. Posterity will undoubtedly apply to our colleague the 
ancient saying of Cicero '' that qualities of honor and probity must be 
exhibited even in the style." 

Not only the Institute, but all France, mourns for Leconte de Lisle 
this year. For she honors in him one of the most sterling poetic celeb- 
rities of this century. His name will live as long as his three master- 
pieces, " The Poemes Antiques," the " Poemes Carbares," and the 
"Poemes Tragiques." He was engaged for thirty years in perfecting 
that great and magnificent work, which, by its very nature, seems to be 
destined for immortality. 

He came to ns from a distant island, a French possession lost in the 
tropical seas. La Eeuuion. It was there that he first came into the 
world, on the 22d of August, 1820. His parentage was from Brittany, 
and it may be that it Avas this dual origin that enabled him to depict 
with such fidelity the wrath of the Scandinavian seas and the splendor 
of Indian climes. In France he lived in obscure and modest seclusion, 
accessible only to the guard of honor made up of a few friends and 
elected disciples. These certainly knew that the illustrious recluse 
was anything but insensible and supercilious. A cursory perusal of 
his poems may liave given rise to such an imjiression, but the testi- 
mony of those who came in contact with him and greater familiariza- 
tion with his verses place him before ns in the attitude not of a frigid 
marble god, but simply that of an ancient sage absorbed in his work 
and following ii with patient ardor. 

In 1886 the votes of tlie.xVcademy sought him in his retirement. 
Glory did not come to his name until a very late hour. He himself 
never thought of complaint on that ground; he well knew that the 
character of his works was not such as to largely draw the admiration 
of the multitude. He reviews India and its religions; Greece, the birth- 
place of art; the restless and dark-souled barbarians in his works, and 
in all of thciu he takes a tragic and picturesque view of history, and 
looks npon nature as the eternal soother of all sorrows. 

In history- he gave preference to obscure and legendary periods. 
They afforded him a wider field for the description of human passions 
pitched to a degree of grandeur and energy which does not comport 
with the periods of j^eaceful civilization. A decided foe of the morbid 
sentimentality which partially pervades the literature of the first half 
of this century, he raised the principle of impersonality in art to the 
eminence of a dogma. His poetry is in a high degree stamped with the 
characteristics of scientific thought. It partakes of it by the logical 
developmentof the subject-matter, by the stanch erudition which leads 
him through the traditions of all the races, and in his poems he again 
brings the soul of ancient heroes into powerfully realistic life. In some 
of those revivals he combines the clear-sightedness of Thncydides with 
the fiery imagination of Lucretius. 

No poet, perhaps, has been more of an artist thaa LeQonte de Lisle, 



708 THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE IN 1894. 

He has written some of the most beautiful lines that ever impressed 
themselves upon human memory. But hoNvever perfect and polished 
may be, the form he never for its sake loses sight of the point; through 
the moving splendor of images can always be perceived a firm intelli- 
gence, a purity of sentiment, the absolute sincerity of which is attested 
by the dignity of his life. On greeting him as one of our greatest ]>oets 
we forestall the judgment of posterity without fear of being belied l)y it. 

All these colleagues, whose memory of recent date I have just recalled, 
"labored, each one according to his aptitude, toward adding to the intel- 
lectual patrimony of their country. We could do them no better honor 
than by calling to their seats in our midst those who most worthily 
continued their labors. 

It is said of Socrates that he was in the habit of curiously questioii- 
ing even the shoemakers and fullers of a town as small as Athens, who 
thought that the intelligent world ended at tlie Pineus and the intel- 
ligible world at the pillars of Hercules; and it may be that he thought 
so himself; for however wise a man may be, he nevertheless belongs to 
his age and to his country, and such a natal pride surely brings to-day 
a smile to our lips. 

Here, on the other hand, is another city, even much smaller than 
Athens; I mean the Institute. It is in France, in the most sociable 
country, the second home of foreigners; it receives in its midst the 
representatives of all the noble qualities of the mind; in fine, does it 
not, with its extensive ramifications in the provinces and abroad, con- 
dense, as it were, the whole of the civilized world? It tells man of 
nearly all he knows about himself and about the universe. Well, gen- 
tlemen, if an ideal Socrates could by questioning you come in possession 
of all your knowledge what would there remain for him to learn ? In a 
word, would not the man who could unite within himself all the things 
that you know and succeed in harmoniously blending them be the per- 
fect man? Let us then strive, gentlemen, to draw nearer to such per- 
fection, and to achieve such intimate blending through ever-increasing 
cooperation, closer intercourse. Such is the wish I have repeatedly 
heard uttered about me, and which in closing I take the liberty of 
expressing to you. 



HEKMAI^^Is^ YON HELMHOLTZ.' 



By AliTHUE W. EUCKER, F. E. S. 



Death lias been busy lately among tlie ranks of German i^liysicists. 
Hertz, Kundt, and Von Uelmlioltz have all been laid low within a few 
months, and the world is the iioorer by some of the best promise of the 
future and the ripest experience of the past. 

The last named on this sad death roll was for long regarded as the 
doyen of the physical sciences in Germany. He celebrated his seven- 
tieth birthday three years ago, and on that occasion the whole world 
(to quote his own words) "from Tomsk to Melbourne" united to do him 
honor. The close of his career thus lacks the element of tragedy, 
which shocked us when we heard that Hertz, in his early maturity, 
before we had ceased to wonder at his first great success, was#dead. 

But the elder, like the younger man, died too soon, working to the 
last. He held one of the highest scientific posts in Germany. Long 
mathematical papers have quite recently been contributed by him to 
the Berlin Berichte. He was present at the meeting of the British 
Association at Edinburgh in 1892, at the Chicago Congress of Electri. 
cians in 1893. It was hoped that he would have attended the meeting 
of the British Association at Oxford in 1894. 

No remarkable events distinguished the earlier years of Helmholtz 
from those of the majority of clever middle-chiss lads. His mother, 
Caroline I*eun, was of English descent; his father was a professor of 
literature in the gymnasium at Potsdam, who, both in and out of school, 
did all that he could to help his promising boj-. On looking back to 
his youth. Von Helmholtz accused himself of a "bad memory for dis- 
connected things," but admitted that he had an unusual power for 
grasping and remembering the details of a connected train of thought. 

When he began the systematic study of geometry he astonished his 
teachers with the practical knowledge of the laws of form which he 
had already attained, chietly by the aid of wooden blocks. He acquired 
"a great love of nature," was especially attracted by physics, and con- 
fessed that while the class was reading Cicero or Virgil, he was often 
busy with illicit calculations under the desk. 

But, though he describes his interest in the special line of study to 
which he subsequently adhered as "amounting even to a passion," it

is evident that tlie passion was controlled by a strong- vein of common 
sense. Neitlier at tliat time, nor for many years afterwards, was a liv- 
ing to be made out of pliysics. The only influential meiuber of the 
family was a military surgeon. It was therefore decided that the young 
man should adopt the profession of his relative, and devote to his 
favorite science such time as he might be able to spare from more 
urgent duties. 

It was not long before the characteiistic bent of his mind displayed 
itself. He was the pui)il of Johannes Miillei-, from Avhose laboratory 
came many of the most distinguished German physiologists of tlielast 
generation. The first two papers which Helmholtz published were on 
fermentation and muscular action, respectively, but the first effort 
which attracted general attraction was an essay on the Conservation 
of Force, published in 1847, when he was 20 years of age. 

It is unnecessary to repeat the oft-told tale of how the pioneers of the 
great generalization, now called the conservation of energy, were for 
a time ignored. German physicists turned away from Mayer. Eng- 
land would not hear, or listened in unintelligent silence to Joule. But 
the year 1847 was an epoch in the history of science. Joule himself, 
for the first time, claimed the full extent of the territory he had con- 
quered. '-On the 28th of April, 1847," says his biographer, "Joule 
gave a popular lecture in Manchester, at St. Anne's Church reading 
room,-' and chose this opportunity to deliver "the first full and clear 
exposition of the universal conservation of that principle now called 
energy." 

The local press would at first have nothing to do with the address, 
"One paper refused to give even notice of it." "The Manchester 
Guardian would, as a favor, print extracts to be selected by them- 
selves." Finally the Manchester Courier, aftin- long debate, promised 
to insert the whole as a special favor, not to Joule, but to his brother. 

Of course no l)lame can attach to the newspaper men for failing to 
recognize the importance of views that were rejected by many of the 
best known scientific authorities, but the theories which in April were 
hawked from one provincial editor to another, found in June, when the 
British Association met at Oxford, an advocate who compelled atten- 
tion. Joule has told the story himself. All the circumstances were 
depressing. An earlier paper, read some years before, had. attracted 
little notice. The chairman, perhaps on this account, suggested that 
the author should be brief. No discussion was invited. In a moment 
the meeting would have i^assed to other business, and the enunciation 
of his views would once more have faded "if a young man had not 
risen in the section and, by his intelligent observations, created a lively 
interest in the new theory. The young man was William Thomson." 
The result was that the paper created a great sensation, and from that 
moment the tide of opinion turned. 

What Thomson did in June, in Oxford, Helmholtz did scarcely a

mouth later in Berlin. His paper was read to the Physical Society of 
that city on the 23d of July, 1847. It was too clear, too powerful, and 
too convincing to be ignored. The line of thought which he had been 
following has been traced by his own hand. The study of medicine led 
to the problem of the nature of ^' vital force." He convinced liimselt 
tbat if— as Stahl had suggested — an animal had the power now of 
restraining, and now of liberating the activity of mechanical forces, it 
would be endowed with the power of perpetual motion. This led to the 
question whether i)erpetual motion was consistent with what was known 
of natural agencies. The essay on the Conservation of Force was, 
according to Yon Helmholtz himself, intended to be a critical investiga- 
tion and arrangement of the facts which bear on this point for the 
benefit of x)hysiologists. In form, however, it was addressed to the 
physicists. 

The paper was called Ueber die Brhaltung der Kraft, eine physika- 
lische Abhandlung. It opens with the statement, "Vorliegende 
Abhandlung musste ihrem Hauptinhalte nach hauptsachlich fiir Phy- 
siker bestimmt werden." It was communicated to the Physical Society 
of Berlin. The author appears to have expected that it would there 
be received as a mere summary of accepted facts, and to have hoped 
that, having gained this authoritative sanction, he could thereafter 
appeal with greater force to his brother physiologists. To his surprise 
the physicists were not only interested, but showed a strong disposition 
to treat the essay as a fantastic speculation. The editor of Poggendorff's 
Annalen declined to publish it. On the other hand, Helmholtz Avas 
supported by his fellow-student, Du Bois Reymond, and by mathema 
ticiau Karl Jacobi. In the eml they carried the Physical Society with 
them. 

The essay itself is full of interest. The phraseology differs from that 
we employ, but the use of terms now regarded as archaic is not due to 
any mistiness of perception. Write energy here and there for "force," 
potential energy for "tension," as defined in the essay, assume our 
fuller knowledge of the results of experiment, and the whole might 
have been written yesterday, instead of nearly fifty years ago. 

The author began by an argument which practically amounts to the 
statement that science is limited to the search for a mechanical expla- 
nation of nature, and that, whatever the final result of the quest may 
be, it must be pushed as far as possible. 

Assuming that the basis of a mechanical theory must ultimately be 
the action of forces between material iioints, and, implicitly assuming 
the Newtonian laws of motion, the conclusion is reached that the law 
of the conservation of energy holds good, and holds good only if the 
forces are central; that is, if they are attractions or repulsions, the 
magnitudes of which depend solely on the distances between the mutu- 
ally reacting pai'ticles. 

The cogency of this as an a priori })roof of the conservation of energy 



712 herma:nn von helmholtz. 

of course depends n]>on whether the premises are admitted to be axi- 
omatic; but it was followed by an appeal to experiment. The greater 
part of the memoir was occupied with an elaborate discussion as to 
whether the law of the couservation of energy was consistent with the 
facts then known. This involved a survey of the api)li<'ation of the law 
to mechanics, heat, electricity, magnetism, and electro-magnetics. A 
number of most interesting calculations and suggestions were made, 
and the conclusion arrived at was ''that the law of the conservation of 
energy does not contradict any known fact in natural science, but in a 
great number of cases is, on the contrary, corroborated in a striking- 
manner." 

The author was acquainted with the earlier experiments of Joule 
only, and, while employing the idea of a mechanical equivalent of heat 
and using symbols to represent it, dismisses the results of observation 
as having but ^-little claim to accuracy." It need hardly be said that 
this opinion was not afterwards extended to the later investigations, 
which were only just then becoming known. 

In a note appended, when the essay was republished in 1881, Von 
Helmholtz expressly disclaimed any right to priority as an originator 
of the doctrine of conservation of energy, but his essay is the more 
remarkable on account of his slight acquaintance with the Avork of his 
predecessors. lie knew nothing of Mayer, and his information as to 
Joule's experiments Avas only gained after his own work was far 
advanced. 

Enough has, perhaps, been said to show that he must, as Professor 
Tait asserts, "be classed as one of the most successful of the early pro- 
moters of the science of energy on legitimate principles." 

The ])aper on the Conservation of Energy was only the third or 
fourth which Helmholtz had published, but his remarkable abilities 
were now fully recognized. 

His connectiou Avith the army was scA'ered in 1848. For some mouths 
he was an assistant in the Anatomical Museum of Berlin, and also 
teacher of anatomy at the Academy of Arts. After this he held in 
succession the professorships of physiology in the universities of 
Konigsberg, Bonn, and Heidelberg, and in 1871 he Avas appointed pro- 
fessor of natural philosoi^hy in the ITniversity of Berlin. 

Honors of all sorts were showered upon him. Late in life he was 
ennobled by the German Emperor, and the esteem in Avhich he was held 
in this country Avas proA^ed by the aAvard of the Copley medal, the high- 
est distinction in the gift of the Eoyal Society. 

It would be impossible to follow in chronological order the work 
which Yon Helmholtz gaA^e to the Avorld during these long years. The 
most that can be attempted is to convey some idea of its importance. 
He was great as a mathematician and i^hysicist, but the direction of 
his most characteristic efforts Avas probably determined by the early 
necessity for seeking a livlihood by the practice of medicine. On the 



HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ. 713 

borderland of physics, pliysiology, and psychology he won a place that 
is all his own This thorny region has been invaded by others from 
both sides, bnt it is not too much to say that You Helmholtz, in his 
triple niastery over anatomy, mathematics, and physics, had unique 
qualilicatious for the task. 

To the oculist he gave the ophthalmoscope, and thus made it possi- 
ble to investigate the conditions of the inmost recesses of the living 
eye. If tlie eye be illuminated a portion of the light returns from the 
hinder surface, is brought to a focus by the lenses of the eye itself, and 
forms an image of the retina in external space. To see this was no 
easy matter. If the patient's eye were focused on a luminous object 
the image would coincide with the source of light, and, even if other- 
wise visible, would be lost in the glare. If he looked elsewhere the 
image would move, but, inasmuch as the lenses can not be adjusted to 
the clear vision of any object nearer than about 10 inches, that is the 
minimum distance from the eye at which it can form the image of its 
own retina. To see this clearly an observer without appliances must 
place himself at least 10 inches from the image, that is, at 20 inches 
from the patient. At that distance the view would be so limited that 
no result could be obtained. 

Yon Helmholtz, however, convinced himself that, if these difticulties 
could be overcome, the image of a brightly illuminated retina could be 
seen. He made the observations through a small hole in the center of 
a mirror, which reflected light into the eye under examination. Then, 
by means of a lens, he shifted the ijosition of the image backward 
until the relative positions of the observer and the patient were such 
that, according to calculation, the retina should be visible. 

Again and again he tried and failed, but he was convinced of the 
validity of the theory, and at last the experiment succeeded. From 
that time the occulist has been able to look into the darkness of the 
pupil, and to see through the gloom the point of entry of the optic 
nerve and the delicate network of blood vessels by which it is sur- 
rounded. 

The great monograph on the Sensations of Tone appeared in 1803. 
The theories advanced were novel, but, though some points are still 
open to dispute, they have as a whole been generally accepted. The 
aim of the work was ambitious, being nothing less than the discovery 
of the physical basis of the sensations which affect us when listening 
to consonant and dissonant musical intervals, respectively. The gen- 
eral nature of the solution arrived at is now well known. If two notes, 
which differ but little from unison, are produced together, throbbing 
alternations in the intensity of the sound are heard as beats. If the 
interval is gradually increased the beats become quicker, till at last 
they can no longer be distinguished separately. According to Yon 
Helmholtz, however, they produce the effect of dissonance. "The 
nerves of hearing," he says, "feel these rapid beats as rough and 



714 HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ. 

unpleasant, because every intermittent excitement of any nervous 
apparatus affects it more powerfully than one that lasts unaltered. 
Consonance is a continuous, dissonance an intermittent sensation of 
tone." The disagreeable effect depends in part upon the number of 
beats, in j)art upon the interval between the notes which produce them, 
being greatest when the rapidity of the beats is neither very large nor 
very small, and when the interval between the two notes is not great. 
In applying this theory it is necessary to take into account not only 
the beats between the two fundamental notes, but also those due to two 
series of secondary sounds by which they may be accomi^anied. The 
presence or absence of one of these — the so-called ui)per harmonic par- 
tials — depends upon the way in which the note has been obtained. 
They produce the differences of quality w^hich distinguish one musical 
instrument from another. They are also the basis of our appreciation 
of the closeness of the relationship between the notes they accompany. 
The want of perfect consonance between compound notes is attributed 
to beats between those members of the two groups of sound which are 
not very ftxr apart on the scale. The growing importance of these 
beats, as the intervals become less and less consonant, was traced with 
wonderful ingenuity. 

This theory alone wonld be insufQcient to account for a percei^tion 
of want of consonance between two iJure notes unaccompanied by 
partials. To explain this recourse was had to a second series of 
attendant sounds, the most important of which had been discovered 
in 1745 by Sorge, a German organist, and was well known as 
Tartini's tone. Von Helmholtz proved that such notes would arise 
when the vibrating body was set in somewhat violent motion, provided 
that the resistances offered to equal displacements in opposite directions 
were unequal. Of course the air, which transmits the sounds to the 
ear, does not possess this property. On the other hand, the drum skin 
of the ear, to which the aerial vibrations are communicated, is not sym- 
metrical, being bent inward by the little " hammer " bone. Von 
Helmholtz, therefore, concluded that it is probable that Tartini's tone 
is due to this membrane. From his point of view it is subjective, in 
the sense that it is produced within the organism, though it originates 
in the auditory apparatus, and not in the brain. It is, if one may use 
the phrase, the rattling of the machinery of the ear. 

Having thus accounted for the production 'of secondary sounds by 
tones, which were themselves unaccompanied by partials. Von Helm- 
holtz explained our sense of the dissonance of inq^erfect intervals, when 
produced by such pure notes, by beats due to the combinational tones. 

But, though he maintained that these theories exj)lained the physical 
"reason of the melodic relationship of two tones," the author of the 
" Tonempfindungen " was careful to point out that the i)rinciples he 
enunciated had not always determined the construction of the scale, 
and do not determine it everv where now. The selection of a series of 



HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ. 715 

notes which were a j^osteriori found to obey certiiin natural laws was 
voluntary. The scale itself is not natnral, in the sense that it is not 
a necessary conseqnence of the construction of the ear. On the con- 
trary, it is the product of artistic invention. Music is thus not a mere 
branch of mechanics, but an art. The architect and the composer alike 
deal with materials which are subject to mechanical laws, but they are 
alike free to fashion from these forms determined not by calculation, 
but by the sense of beauty. 

Von llelmholtz was at work on optics while still engaged in the study 
of sound. The Handbu<;h der Physiologischen Optik appeared in sec- 
tions in 1856, 1800, and 1860. It is, as he himself has said, a complete 
survey of the whole held of that science. In the first place he treated 
the eye as an optical instrument, traced the path of the rays through 
it, and discussed the mechanism by which it can be accommodated to 
distinct vision at different distances. To investigate the last point 
it was necessary to measure the images formed by reflection from the 
surfaces of the crystalline lens. For this purpose he invented a special 
instrument — the opthalmometer — by which such measurements can be 
made on the living patient with great accuracy. 

In an interesting course of popular lectures, published in 1868, and 
since translated by Dr. Atkinson, Yon Helmholtz insisted that far from 
being, as was often supposed, a perfect organ, the eye has many optical 
defects; and that our unconsciousness of these is due not so much to 
its perfection from the instrument-maker's point of view, as to the ease 
with which it adapts itself to different circumstances, and to the skill 
with which long ])ractice enables us to interpret the messages it conveys 
to the brain. 

The se(;ond section of the work was devoted to the sensation of sight. 
The theories of color and of intensity, the duration of the sensation of 
light, the phenomena of contrast and subjective aj)pearances were all 
discussed with a fullness never before attained. The last part was 
devoted to such problems as our visual appreciation of three dimensions 
in space and binocular vision. 

The theory of color, originally due to Young, was adopted and 
enlarged by Helmholtz. It assumes that all the sensations of color are 
compounded out of three fundamental sensations, which are respec- 
tively a red, green, and violet or blue. Nearly if not all the phenomena 
of color-blindness can be explained on the hypothesis that, in the case 
of i^ersons so affected, the power of appreciating one or other of these 
sensations is wanting. 

It was hardly to be expected that differences of opinion would not 
arise as to some of the points discussed in two works so wide in their 
scope and so novel in their methods as the treatises on the sensations 
of tone and on physiological optics. Koenig, the celebrated instrument 
maker, has demonstrated the existence of beats which in the case of 
compound sounds could be explained as due to the upper partials, but 



716 HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ. 

as they are prodiuted wlieu the notes are as i^nre as it is possible to make 
them, they do not appear to be accounted for by the original theory. 
A writer ( Voigt. Wiedemann's Aunaleu, 1890, 40, p. (JGO) who has recently 
examined the matter, concludes that both the combination tones of Von 
Hehuholtz and the beat tones of Koenig can theoretically be produced 
without the unsymmetrical arrangement which the former regarded as 
essential, and that the one system or the other will tend to predominate 
according to circumstances. The more nearly the energies of the two 
vibiations api)roach equality the greater is the probability that the 
combination tones will be heard. The less nearly the condition of equal 
energy is fultilled, themoi-e important will the beat notes become. 

Several other points of considerable interest have been raised, but 
those who on one ground or another have objected to the views of Von 
Helmholtz, have not been entirely in accord among themselves. It is 
probable that the theory will finally be accepted in its broad outlines, 
but will require modifications of some nnportance in its details. 

The theory of color, too, with which the name of Von Helmholtz is 
associated, is not without its difficulties. A new edition of his Optics 
is appearing in parts, and in this alterations have been made which 
prove that the author regarded the original hypothesis as capable 
of modification and improvement. A strong committee of the Koyal 
Society, which has recently reported on color vision, adopted the 
terminology of the Young-Helmholtz theory, but pointed out that it 
fails to explain some curious cases of diseased vision, in which the sen- 
sation of color is confined to the blue end of the spectrum, while all 
the other tints appear as white. On the other hand, the rival theory 
of Hering also fails to account for some of the known facts. Thus the 
problem is not finally solved, but the importance of the contribution to 
its solution made in the Physiologischen Optik is not disputed even by 
those who feel that there is need for further inquiry in the future. 

In these investigations on the eye and the ear, on light and sound, we 
see Von Helmholtz at his most characteristic work; but the shortest 
sketch of his scientific achievements would be incomplete without 
reference to his eminence as a mathematician. 

He was, as might have been expected, deeply interested in the 
electro-magnetic theory of light, and develo]>ed it in a form Avhich is 
even more general than that adopted by Clerk Maxwell; but it seems 
probable that, while Von Helmholtz has indicated possibilities. Max- 
well has taken account of all that is necessary to explain the facts. 

Another inquiry of the first importance, and conducted with the 
greatest ability, was that on the laws of vortex motion. The move- 
ments of a liquid may be so complicated that it is at first sight an 
almost hopeless task to analyze the motion into its simplest elements. 
Changes of shape of the most exaggerated character may occur. A 
compact mass may be drawn out into long threads. Particles at one 
time far apart may be brought close together and again separated. 



HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ. 717 

If, however, instead of coiitemplatiug the final results we consider 
what is actnally going- on at a given instant at a given place it is 
possible to describe the facts in simple terms. A minute sphere of 
the liquid may be moving as a whole in some definite direction, may 
be changing its shape, and may be rotating about an axis. This last 
is the distinguishing characteristic of vortex motion. You Helmholtz 
was the first to detect some of the most remarkable properties of those 
portions of a fluid in which it occurs. The investigation was confined 
to a frictionless, incompressible liquid, and the author proved that in 
such an ideal substance the property of vortex motion could neither be 
])roduced nor destroyed by any natural forces. If it existed in a group 
of particles, they would be incai)able of transmitting it to others. 
They could not be deprived of it themselves. The laws of their motion 
would establish between them a curious and indissoluble fellowship. 

A number of beads, strung on a ring of thread or wire and I'otat- 
ing about it, afford, with regard to a similarly shaped system of par- 
ticles possessing vortex motion, an analogy so imperfect that it is 
almost dangerous to use it. But the two have, at all events, one prop- 
erty in common. The wire may be moved from place to place or bent 
into various forms, but wherever it goes, however it is distorted, it 
carries the beads with it. The connection thus artificially secured 
would be automatically maintained in a ring of fluid particles endowed 
Avith vortex motion. The ring might enlarge or contract, be deflected 
or distorted, but amid all such vicissitudes the rotating particles 
would move among their fellows apparently free, but in reality insep- 
arably united. 

This and other iteculiarities, upon which it is unnecessary to dwell, 
give to vortex motion a special interest and importance. Lord Kelvin 
has made the protbund and remarkal)le suggestion that the atoms of 
matter may be vortex rings in a frictionless liquid. Whatever the 
ultimate fate of this theory may be, it is justified as affording a glimpse 
into new possibilities. It is, at all events, not absurd to dream that 
we may some day regard matter as a special form of S(une more funda- 
mental substance, from the comi)aratively simple properties of which 
the laws of chemistry and j^hysics may be deduced. Apart, however, 
from the use which has been made of vortexes in this and lu other 
ways, as affording a basis for the explanation of physical facts, Von 
Helmholtz must rank as the discoverer of a series of fundamental 
propositions in hydrodynamics which had entirely escaped the notice 
of his predecessors. 

During the last years of his life Von Helmholtz was president of the 
" Physikalisch Teclmische Eeichsaustalt" at Charlottenberg. In 1884 
the late Werner Siemens offered £25,000 toward the foundation of a 
State research laboratory. The Iveichstag voted the necessary addi- 
tions to this sum. The institution has been established on a large scale, 
and the first volume of records was juiblished in March of the present

year. The preface was sigued by Vou Helnilioltz, and thus the career 
of the great investigator was fittingly ckjsed by the inauguration of a 
national college devoted to learning and research. 

In a brief and imperfect sketch such as this it is barely possible to 
give an idea of the extent of the work of Von Helmholtz; it is certainly 
impossible to do justice to its fulness and depth. I have mapped the 
directions of the main streams of his thought. Only those who follow 
them in detail can count the fields they have fertilized. In the course 
of his investigations all sorts of side issues were studied, a vast number 
of subsidiary problems solved. The alertness of his intellect, the read- 
iness with which he turned from one science to another, the extraor- 
dinary ease with which he handled weapons the most diverse and the 
most difficult to master, these are not less wonderful than the catalogue 
of his main achievements. 

The technical merits of his work will, of course, be appreciated 
chiefly by experts. Special knowledge is not necessary to understand 
its importance. He was one of the first to grasp the xjrinciple of the 
conservation of energy. He struck, independently and at a critical 
moment, a powerful blow in its defense. He penetrated further than 
any before him into the mystery of the mechanism which connects us 
with external nature through the eye and the ear. He discovered the 
fundamental properties of vortex motion m a perfect liquid, which have 
since not only been applied in the explanation of all sorts of physical 
phenomena, of ripple marks in the sand and of cirrus clouds in the air, 
but have been the bases of some of the most advanced and pregnant 
speculations as to the constitution of matter and of the luminiferous 
ether itself. 

These scientific achievements are not, perhaps, of the type Avhich 
most easily commands general attention. They have not been utilized 
in theological warfare; they have not revolutionized the daily business 
of the world. It will, however, be universally admitted that such tests 
do not supply a real measure of the greatness of a student of nature. 
That must finally be appraised by his j)ower of detecting beneath the 
complication of things as they seem something of the order Avhich 
rules things as they are. Judged by this standard, few names will 
take a higher i)lace than that of Hermann vou Helmholtz.

Wherever the iuvestigatiiig' ininds of scientists are at work promot- 
ing- the insight of man into the mysteries of nature, wherever friends 
of natural philosophy are keenly alive to the importance of this com- 
paratively new field of study, a field in which lie some of the most 
essential interests of modern civilization, there will be sincere and 
deep regret over the death of a young ]>rofessor whose splendid 
career came to an untimely end on the first day of this year. Prof. 
Heinrich Hertz, of the University of Bonn, in Germany, died on Jan- 
uary 1, 1894, uot yet 37 years of age. For the last two years he had 
not been in good health, and, though under the treatment of his capa- 
ble physicians he several times rallied and seemed to be restored to his 
former strength, the last winter brought a serious relapse. A chronic 
and painful disease of the nose spread to the neighboring Highmore's 
cavity, and graduallj^ led to blood poisoning. He was conscious and in 
possession of his full mental power to the last; he must have been 
aware that recovery was hopeless, but not a word escaped his lips that 
would have shown to his dear ones whether hope or fear filled his heart. 
His wife and his mother were at his bedside for many weeks, giving 
him their tenderest care, and in spite of his continuous suflerings 
there were many hours of genial discourse. At such times they read 
to him, and he gave himself up to general topics and to matters of per- 
sonal interest to them, displaying even yet his wonted brightness and 
cheerfulness. 

Heinrich Hertz, boru iu Hamburg on February 22, 1857, was the eldest 
sou of exceptionally good and clever parents. His father was at the be- 
ginning of his career a lawyer; in due course of time he rose to the posi- 
tion of judge of the supreme court of appeal, and has now for a number 
of years been a senator of the free city of Hamburg. The childhood of 
Professor Hertz was subject to every pure, healthful, and elevating 
influence that a highly capable father and a superior mother can exer- 
cise. Both of them gave a great part of their time to their children ; 
their eldest boy especially enjoyed the advantage of their companion- 
ship in many a holiday's ramble through the green fields and woods, and

iu cozy winter uiglits spent in leadiug Homer, the Germau classics, and 
other books. 

In passing throngh the high school classes of his native city his 
predilection for the study of natural science early asserted itself. 
Whenever a new course of study began and a new text-book was put 
into the hands of the class, the boy would devote every leisure moment 
to the perusal of the volume, exi)erinientiug frequently with apparatus 
made by himself, and never ceasing until he could tell his father, "I 
have mastered that book." This statement always proved to be per 
fectly correct. In spite of his decided gift for natural science, Hertz 
chose as his vocation civil engineering. But when, after completing his 
studies, he came to take the iirst steps toward the practical execution 
of this design, he felt that his choice had been a mistake. His parents, 
with a ready perception of the deeply rooted needs of his strong and 
peculiar nature, whose desires they would not think of thwarting, 
entered into his new idea, gave him their approval, and furnished him 
with the necessary means. So he set out on anew course of studies in 
mathematics and natural science. He gave himself up to this work 
heart and soul, and for a number of years knew no other object in life 
but unceasing and unrelenting hard work. He studied physics at 
Munich and Uerlin, and enjoyed the warm regard of Professor Helm- 
holtz. In 1880 he became his assistant, and at his instigation, in 1883 
settled down as a " privatdocent," or professor without salary, at the 
University of Kiel. It was from this time on that he made the science 
of electricity the one great object of his researches, the main pursuit ot 
Ms life. The first years were filled with investigations relating to 
electric discharges, etc. He busied himself, above all, Avitli the new 
conceptions of the inner mechanism of electric phenomena and of the 
connection between these and the phenomena of light and of radiant 
heat. These conceptions, originating with Faraday and Maxwell m 
England and represented in Germany by llelmholtz, were now carried 
forward by Professor Hertz. 

His reputation soon spread through his native country, and he was 
in 1885 called to the Polytechnic School of Karlsruhe, which for vari- 
ous reasons became very dear to him. One of its attractions was the 
exceptionally fine and well endowed laboratory of the institution, 
which furnished the most desirable facilities for unlimited experiment- 
ing. At Karlsruhe Professor Hertz found a wife who was in every way 
a lovely and graceful, devoted, and highly intellectual companion to hmi. 
His life was from this time on divided between the pursuit of his main 
object, the progress of science, and home happiness; both he and his 
wife derived rare gratification from literature and tlie beauty of nature. 
It was from Karlsruhe that he went to Heidelberg, there to enjoy the 
proudest moment of his life, iu the year 1889, when, greeted with enthu- 
siastic applause by most prominent scientists, he stood upon the [)lat- 
foriu to tender an account of his researches and their results. Who 



SKETCH OF HEINRICH HERTZ. 721 

that saw him there, the very picture of youthful vigor and life, could 
have forboded tliat those flue and i)enetratiug eyes, to which for the 
first time siuce our earth turned around its poles electric waves had 
been revealed, were so soon to be closed in death ! 

Soon Professor Hertz received flattering calls to the most prominent 
universities. He preferred the smaller town of Bonn, where he settled 
down in 1890, even to Berlin, tlie capital, because what lie sought after 
was the most serious and fruitful work, not glory and outward advan- 
tage. In Bonn he succeeded to the eminent physicist, Professor Clau- 
sius. This was in itself a high distinction conferred ui)on so young 
a man as Professor Hertz. Cousidered all over Europe as one of the 
most prominent, he Avas looked up to as one of the most promising 
leaders in the science of electricity. Not only had his own country con- 
ferred high honors npon this young and ardent worker, but the chief 
academies of England, France, Italy, Austria, and l^nssia now crowned 
his eftbrts with prizes, honorary memberships, and other tokens of uni- 
versal esteem and gratitude. 

Up to the middle of this century the jdienomeiui of electricity and 
magnetism had been only inade(iuately explained by applying to them 
Newton's law of gravitation, and asserting that in the same way as 
celestial bodies exercise power of attraction at a distance and without 
the intervention of a medium the two kinds of material electricity were 
attracting and repelling each other while passing through space or 
through nonconductors. 

It was the great English physicist Faraday who first sought to carry 
the knowledge of electricity to a higher stage by entering upon the 
study of phenomena with a mind free from preconceived opinions. He 
put forth as the foundation on which to base new theories his observa- 
tions of electric and magnetic forces, their influence upon each other, 
their attractions for material bodies, and their propagation by the 
transmission of the excitation from one point of space to another. He 
questioned the assumption of space being void, aud conjectured that 
the ether which transmits the luminous waves sufl'ers modifications 
perceived under the form of electrical and magnetic manifestations. 
His discoveries, important as they were, gained due consideration only 
when Faraday's great countryman. Maxwell, treated the same sub- 
ject in a purely scientific and theoretical way, publishing in 1865 his 
Mathematical Theory of Light. The nature and properties of ether he 
left undecided, and they form to this day dominant questions, destined, 
it seems, ultimately to reveal the deepest secrets of natural science. 
Maxwell labored to confirm the connection, surmised by Faraday, 
between light, electricity, and magnetism; the idea of velocity now 
entered the theory and became of supreme importance. Maxwell 
arrived at the conclusion that the velocity of electromotion in a given 
medium must be identical with the velocity of light in the sajne 
medium, and that therefore ether, being contained in all ponderable 
SM 94 40 



722 SKETCH OF HETNEICH HERTZ. 

bodies, would have to be looked upon as tbe conductor of electric 
motion and power. Consequently tlie periodical motions of ether, which 
our eye conceives as light, and which he figured as transversal waves, 
were considered by Maxwell to be at the same time undulations of 
electricity. These concei)tions, unproved by experiment as JVlaxwell 
left them, had merely the value of a scientific hypothesis emanating 
from a man of rare genius. To liave proved them facts, and tliereby 
to have united two vast and highly important domains of natural phi- 
losoj)Iiy, is the lasting credit of Professor Hertz. 

The complexity of phenomena of light and electricity and the insuffi- 
cient opportunities afforded by the laboratory for deductions of such 
magnitude rendered the obstacles barring the road to exact observation 
well-nigh insurmountable. Many of the best and ablest naturalists 
were laboring to cope with these difficulties. Two English scientists of 
highest staiuling, Prof.G. F. Fitzgerald and Dr.O. T. Lodge, were during 
the eighties occupied with experiments for the investigation and meas- 
urement of electric waves. But it was reserved for Hertz to discover 
and apply with marvelous ingenuity the necessary "detector," a reso- 
nating circuit with an air gap, the resistance of which is broken down 
by well-timed impulses, so that visible sparks are i^roduced. After an 
unceasing course of experiments, in which he manifested indefatigable 
energy and a wonderful faculty of reaching the very essence of the 
matter, he succeeded in deciding the questions : Is the propagation of 
electrical and magnetic forces instantaneous? and further. Can elec- 
trical or magnetic effects be obtained directly from light"? The jjaper 
"On very rapid electric oscillations," which was published in 1887, was 
the first of a splendid series of researches which appeared in Wiede- 
mann's Annalen between the years 1887 and 1890, and in which Hertz 
showed with ample experimental i)roof and illustration that electro- 
magnetic actions are propagated with finite velocity through space. 
These twelve epoch-making j)apers were afterwards republished — with 
an introductory chapter of singular interest and value, and a reprint of 
some observations on electric discharges made by Von Bezold in 1870 — 
under the title Uutersuchungen iiber die Ausbreitung der elektrischen 
Kraft. A translation of this book, entitled Electric Waves, by D. E. 
Jones, B. Sc, with illustrations and a preface by Lord Kelvin, has just 
been published in England. 

In 1889, when laying before the Congress of German Naturalists at 
Heidelberg the results of his labors, Professor Hertz, with the modesty 
characteristic of the true investigator, the utterly unassuming disciple 
of science, gave ready and graceful acknowledgment to the efforts made 
by his predecessors or cooperators in the work, some of whom had all 
but attained the results which they aimed at and which he achieved. 
It is pleasant to recollect that when he had gained the end toward 
which they also had been striving, the English professors, Oliver Lodge 
and Fitzgerald, were foremost in announcing his success, and in prepar- 



SKETCH OF HEINRICH HERTZ. 723 

ing the Englisli-speakiTig world to appreciate tlie importance of Lis dis- 
coveries. A natural bent of iiiiud toward the qiiestious at issue had 
awakened the young professor's creative powers; his complete concen- 
tration upon the vital point and his intuitive perceptions led him to 
definite results and complete success where so many able minds had 
searched in vain. In the April number of this magazine Herbert 
Spencer, speaking of the late Professor Tyndall, gives a number of 
traits that apply with singular force and exactness to Professor Hertz, 
Of these the first is "the scientific use of the imagination." It may 
well be said that with this constructive imagination, as Mr. Spencer 
terms it, originated Professor Hertz's rare success as a discoverer and 
as an instructor. 

To find out the most effective arrangement of electrical conductors 
and to secure t\\e conditions which would produce the strongest vibra- 
tions at regular intervals and iu quickest succession, we might say the 
adjustment of his instruments was the first part of his work. Having 
brought about electric undulations up to several hundred millions iu 
one second, Hertz proved through experiment that the waves of elec- 
tricity are transversal like those of light, and that the transmission 
requires a certain lapse of time. He ascertained exactly the velocity 
of electricity; it is found by multiplying the length of wave, which he 
measured, by the duration of the vibration, which can be calculated, 
and he found this velocity to be, as Maxwell had supj)Osed, equal to 
that of light, and, moreover, equal to the velocity of electric waves in 
metallic wires. The grand consequence of this last discovery was the 
cognizance of a new fact, that what had hitherto been considered as a 
current of electricity in a wire is really a movement along the surface 
of the wire. Maxwell's magnetic theory of light found further cor- 
roboration by the experimental demonstration of electric power as 
propagating from its center in waves similar to sound. The electric 
undulations are subject to the same process of retiection, refraction, 
absorption, etc., as the rays and waves of light, from which they are 
in the end distinguished only by their considerably greater length, 
measured sometimes by kilometers. The crowning experiments of this 
course finally changed what had hitherto been looked upon as a coin- 
cidence between two orders of distinct phenomena into a demonstration 
of identity. By gathering the electric sjiark iu the focus of a large 
concave mirror, whence it came forth in the form of a rectilinear beam, 
the properties of the«electric ray were shown to be identical with those 
of a luminous ray, the former producing phenomena which have here- 
tofore been observed only in lights — those of polarization. This result 
renders all theorizing on the matter superfluous; the identity of the 
two powers springs from the experiment itself; ocular proof is produced 
for the projyosition that light is in its very essence an electrical phe- 
nomenon, whether it be the light of the sun, of a candle, or of a glow- 
worm. Supi^ress electricity in the universe, light would disax^pear. 



724 SKETCH OF HEINRICH HERTZ. 

Suppress the lumiiiiferous ether, electric and magnetic forces would 
cease to act through space. Even a body not casting light can be a 
center of electrical action if it radiates heat. Electricity therefore pos- 
sesses all nature and even man. The eye itself is, in fact, an electrical 
organ. 

The influence of this new system of physics upon the development of 
natural scien"e and the manifold applications in practical life of which 
it is capable can not easily be overrated. Only recently a new a])plica- 
tion of Hertz's discovery was made by an American, who is trying to 
develop photographs by the agency of the Hertzian waves, as science 
has named them — that is, by electricity instead of light. Hertzian 
waves, Hertzian investigations, apparatus, and methods form hence- 
forth an essential part of all hand and text books of electricity. The 
facts established by Hertz's experiments have been molded into a math- 
ematical formula by their author, who in this purely theoretical work 
also has shown himself to be a master of high genius in the realm of 
abstract science. There is at present in press and will soon be issued 
by T. A. Barth, at Leipsic, a comprehensive work, entitled Principles of 
Mechanics in a New Counection, found among his unpublislied i)aiiers 
at the death of Professor Hertz. Its appearance is eagerly watched 
for by the scientilic world. 

However highly his own time and posterity may i^rize the n)an of 
science, the great discoverer, in Professor Hertz, his value as su<;h to 
the world tit large does not surpass Ihat of the rare ])urity and great- 
ness of his character, of the intrinsic merit which he possessed for 
those who knew him ])ersonally. A world-wide reputation so rapidly 
attained miglit have produced in the young man some feeling of 
elation and pride and in his colleagues somewhat of envy. But, as 
Prof. Hubert Ludwig, representing the University of Bonn, at Professor 
Hertz's funeral in Hamburg, said in his memorial speech: 

" The rich harvest of fame and glory which was granted him, and 
that was so fully merited as iu)t to be tainted by a single breath of envy 
or jealousy, never caused him to gi\'e up one atom of the noble sim- 
plicity and genuine modesty which were a fundamental trait of his 
character. His modesty was a most lovable (piality in this great man, 
asserting itself not only in everyday lile, but also in his scientific 
labors, which it pervades with the endearing charm of an amiable per- 
vsouality. It was coupled with the most considerate indnlgence when 
judging others. His ever-ready recognition of other people's merits 
made it a sheer imijossibility to grudge him his attainments or to be 
his enemy. 

'None knew him but to love liini, 
'None named him but to praise.' 

At the same time he was governed by an inflexible veracity." 

He was indeed a most lovable man, and was never happier than in 
giving pleasure to others. His kindness and benevolence found exi)res- 
sion in many ways, most of all toward those above whom he was placed 
as head of bis department in the university. It was a pleasure to notice 



SKETCH OF HEINRICH HERTZ. 725 

his satisfaction, when he foimd it in accordance with his duty, to confer 
a benefit or fav'or. And when it was incumbent upon him to refuse or 
displease, he became the director who performed his duty and the 
friend who regretted what had to be done. He was always ready to 
show hospitahty to scientific men who came to Bonn from other parts 
of Germany or from foreign countries. Even under the restraint of a 
foreign tongue (he spolve English and French with consideral)le fluency) 
his conversation was charming. Kot what he had achieved gave liim 
his ascendency in scientific discourse, but what he, beyond a thousand 
learned men, could achieve at anytime — original and sagacious thoughts, 
springing nj) on the spur of the moment, and losing none of their force 
by being expressed in the most unpretending, simple form. When 
entertaining friends or conversing with his dear ones he perfectly for- 
got the learned professor in himself; he was so uuich at his ease, so full 
of fun, that none around him could he]p sharing his gayety. Many of 
his guests, prominent men of science as well as students, will always 
remember with pleasure and gratitude delightful trips made with Pro- 
fessor Hertz to the Siebengebirge or evenings of genial intercourse at 
his house in the Quantiusstrasse at Bonn. Absolutely devoid of any 
desire to pose before the public, the professor sometimes astonished 
students newly entered for his lectures by ])utting in a bit of humor 
where they had expected abstract instruction ; but they soon found them- 
selves none the worse for it. Some simple word, a casual remark made 
as if it were a self-understood thing, from his lips did more toward 
improving the mind of his audience than a long lecture from another. 
He was not a scientist inculcating one special branch of knowledge; 
he was a thinker. To be considered an authority, even by the youngest 
beginner, was an idea that never entered his mind. In the congenial 
atmosphere of advanced classes new ideas and conceptions seemed to 
rise in him and flow from his lips as though there could be no easier 
thing in the world. He was at his very best when propounding a 
problem to this small circle, showing how he would attack it. iSTone, 
however capable, but could profit by his teaching; genius itself seemed 
to ijrompt it. 

With i)enetratiug perspicacity he took hold of his problems. As a 
veritable disci])le of natural science he strove to accomplish his ideal 
ends, although by means of theory, which he completely mastered, yet 
not merely by theory and not for her sake only; what he aimed at first 
and last was the most accurate establishment of facts. Pervaded as 
his strong personality was by an absorbing love of his science, the rare 
harmony of his nature kept him equally from an exaggerated enthusiasm 
and from prosaic dullness. An uncommonly great number of valuable 
researches made at the Physical Institute at Bonn during the short 
time of his leadership j)rove his rare capacity and untiring eagerness 
to incite young talents to the best possible application of their faculties 
and so pave the way for their success in research. But in a wider 



726 SKETCH OF HEINRICH HERTZ. 

sense of the word we may call liis disciples all those physicists who 
are at this moment and will be for a long time occupied in exploring 
the provinces which he was the first to open. In this sense almost 
one-quarter of all living physicists call themselves Professor Hertz's 
followers. 

The honors paid at his funeral to the memory of this young and 
ardent worker were exceptionally great. He was buried in his native 
city. Hamburg, where the most widespread sympathy for his family and 
the deepest regret over his loss were shown. From Bonn, Karlsruhe, 
and Berlin came friends, colleagues, and students, some of them officially 
representing their colleges. Universities and prominent men from all 
parts of our globe have sent messages of esteem and sympathy to the 
wife, the parents, and the University of Bonn. It may be questioned 
whether such utterances of sympathy and respect, much as they tend 
to make mankind feel itself as one, can offer consolation to those whose 
bereavement is greater than words are able to convey. However, what 
Mr. Lowell said in one of his simple and admirable memorial addresses 
is certainly true : 

"It may seem paradox, but the only alleviation of such grief is a 
sense of the greatness and costliness of the sacrifice that gave birth to 
it, and this sense is brought home to us by the measure in which others 
appreciate our loss." 

Prof. Hubert Ludwig, of Bonn, uttered the last farewell at the grave 
of his friend and colleague. He expressed the sentiment of those 
grieving at his bier in these final words: 

''This loss is so great that we are tempted to recall the old saying of 
the envy of the gods. But in this solemn hour let us resolutely banish 
such temptation, and instead of rebelling against destiny, let us at the 
open grave of this God-inspired investigator bow low onr heads and 
hearts before the inscrutable."
