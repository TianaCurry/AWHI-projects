REPORT 

OF THE 

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN 
INSTITUTION 

C. G. Abbot 
FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1931 

To the Board, of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution: 

Gentlemen : I have the honor to submit herewith my report 
showing the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution 
and the Government bureaus under its administrative charge dur- 
ing the fiscal year ended June 30, 1931. The first 21 pages contain 
a summary account of the affairs of the Institution. Appendixes 
1 to 11 give more detailed reports of the operations of the United 
States National Museum, the National Gallery of Art, the Freer 
Gallery of Art, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the Interna- 
tional Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, the Astrophysical 
Observatory, the Division of Kadiation and Organisms, the United 
States Regional Bureau of the International Catalogue of Scientific 
Literature, the Smithsonian library, and of the publications issued 
under the direction of the Institution. 

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION 

OUTSTANDING EVENTS OF THE YEAR 

An appropriation of $10,000 was made by the Congress for pre- 
liminary architectural plans of the extensions to the Natural History 
Building of the United States National Museum authorized by Con- 
gress last year. The new reptile house of the Zoological Park was 
completed and formally opened to the public on February 27, 1931. 
A reorganization of several exhibition halls of the xArts and Indus- 
tries Building of the National Museum has added greatly to the 
attractiveness of the exhibits of costumes, coins and stamps, and 
machinery. A small souvenir guide to the Institution and its 
branches has been published privately by the Smithsonian and seems 
highly appreciated by visitors. For unity of policy, greater effi- 
ciency, and simplification of records and accounts, the separate edi- 
torial staffs of the Smithsonian, the National Museum, and the Bu- 

1 



2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

reau of American Ethnology have been consolidated under one gen- 
eral management and the offices brought closely together. Two ex- 
ceptionally valuable publications, The Skeletal Remains of Early 
Man, by A. Hrdlicka, and A History of Applied Entomology, by 
L. O. Howard, were completed. A bequest netting approximately 
$50,000 has been received from the estate of the late James Arthur. 
Its income is to be used for promoting knowledge of the sun. A 
friend of the Institution has announced to it a large intended bequest 
to promote and reward original investigation. Numerous valuable re- 
search and collecting expeditions by the National Museum, the Bu- 
reau of American Ethnology, and the Zoological Park have returned 
highly successful. Accounts of their results will be found below. A 
gigantic dinosaur, Diplodocus longus, 75 feet long, whose skeleton 
has been in preparation for several years, has been placed on exhi- 
bition. Improved methods of solar-radiation research have been 
perfected and applied in connection with the observing stations at 
Table Mountain, Calif., and Mount Brukkaros, Southwest Africa, 
Volume V of the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory, con- 
taining all results of the years 1920 to 1930, inclusive, on the meas- 
urement of solar radiation has been sent to press. The numerous 
variations of the sun since the year 1920 are represented by monthly 
mean values whose average probable error is less than 0.1 per cent. 
Long-continuing regular periodicities in solar variation are demon- 
strated. Highly accurate results on the spectral distribution of 
phototropism in plants have been obtained by the Division of Radia- 
tion and Organisms. By cooperative work with the Fixed Nitrogen 
Research Laboratory, excellent results on the absorption of pure 
organic chemicals in the infra-red spectrum have been reached, and 
an independent method for determining the ozone content of the 
earth's atmosphere has been worked out and applied at Table Moun- 
tain, Calif. 

THE ESTABLISHMENT 

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of 
England, who, in 1826, bequeathed his property to the United States 
of America " to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of 
knowledge among men." In receiving the property and accepting 
the trust. Congress determined that the Federal Government was 
without authority to administer the trust directly, and therefore con- 
stituted an " establishment " whose statutory members are " the Presi- 
dent, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the 
executive departments." 



EEPOET OF THE SECRETARY 6 

THE BOARD OF REGENTS 

The aflFairs of the Institution are administered by a Board of 
Regents whose membership consists of " the Vice President, the Chief 
Justice, three Members of the Senate, and three Members of the 
House of Representatives, together with six other persons other than 
Members of Congress, two of whom shall be resident in the city of 
Washington and the other four shall be inhabitants of some State, 
but no two of them of the same State." One of the Regents is elected 
chancellor by the board. In the past the selection has fallen upon 
the Vice President or the Chief Justice, and a suitable person is 
chosen by the Regents as Secretary of the Institution, who is also 
secretary of the Board of Regents, and the executive officer directly 
in charge of the Institution's activities. 

Changes in the personnel of the board during the year consisted 
of the loss of two citizen Regents : Robert S. Brookings, of Missouri, 
through expiration of his term, and Dwight W. Morrow, of New 
Jersey, through the automatic expiration of his term as a citizen 
Regent upon his induction into the office of United States Senator 
from New Jersey. 

The roll of the Regents at the close of the fiscal year was as 
follows : Charles Evans Hughes, Chief Justice of the United States, 
chancellor; Charles Curtis, Vice President of the United States; 
members from the Senate, Reed Smoot, Joseph T. Robinson, Claude 
A. Swanson; members from the House of Representatives, Albert 
Johnson, R. Walton Moore, Robert Luce; citizen members, Irwin B. 
Laughlin, Pennsylvania; Frederic A. Delano, Washington, D. C; 
and John C. Merriam, Washington, D. C.

MATTERS OF GENERAL INTEREST 
PKESEXTATION OF LANGLEY MEDAL TO MANLY AND BYUD 

As mentioned in my last report, the fifth and sixth awards of the 
Langley Gold Medal for Aerodromics were made late in 1929 to 
Charles Matthews Manly (posthumously) and to Admiral Richard 
Evelyn Byrd, respectively. On December 11, 1930, at the annual 
meeting of the Board of Regents of the Institution, the posthumous 
presentation of the medal to Mr. Manly was made through the person 
of his eldest son. In presenting the medal, the chancellor of the 
board, Hon, Charles Evans Hughes, spoke of the previous awards 
and then said : 

It was awarded posthumously to Charles Matthevrs Manly at the board's 
meeting of December 12, 1929. This exceptional action was taken in recognition 



8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3] 

of the fact that the outstanding merit of Mr. Manly's invention and construc- 
tion of the light, radial, gasoline airplane engine has become more and more 
apparent in the last years. 

Mr. Hughes then quoted Mr. Charles L. Lawrance, president of 
the Wright Aeronautical Corporation, in part, as follows : 

When we consider that the most popular type of airplane engine of to-day is 
almost identical in its general detail and arrangement with the one evolved by 
Charles Manly in 1902, we are lost in admiration for a man who, with no data 
at his diisposal, no examples of similar art on which to roughly base his design, 
and no workmen capable of making the more difficult parts of his engine, never- 
theless, through the processes of a logical mind, tlie intelligent application of 
the science of mathematics, and the use of his surprising mechanical skill, suc- 
ceeded in constructing an engine developing 52.4 horsepower for a weight of 
125 pounds, or a weight of 2.4 pounds per horsepower, which stood up under 
severe tests, once even going through a full-power, nonstop run of 10 hours. 

Mr. Manly accepted the medal on behalf of his father, and con- 
cluded with the words, " I am sure that if he were living there is 
no honor which he would so greatly treasure." 

The presentation of the medal to Admiral Byrd was made at the 
Smithsonian on the morning of March 27, 1931, by Chancellor 
Hughes. After reviewing the purpose of the founding of the Lang- 
ley medal, Mr. Hughes said : 

Your investigations in connection with the science of aviation have included 
severe tests of airplanes, their navigating instruments, and the possibilities 
of using them for geographical exploration. In these enterprises you have 
made the nonstop west-east passage of the Atlantic, the first nonstop flight to 
the North Pole, and the first nonstop flight to the South Pole. You have ex- 
plored and photographed great regions of the globe hitherto unseen by man. 

It gives me great pleasure to present to you. Admiral Byrd, the Langley 
Gold Medal for Aerodromics, in recognition of your outstanding investigations 
relating to the application of the science of aerodromics to geographical 
exploration. 

Admiral Byrd, in expressing his appreciation of the award, con- 
cluded : 

All fliers have the deepest respect for the work of Professor Langley. My 
own feeling of respect is so profound that this rare medal is doubly precious 
to me in bearing his name. 

His work was epochal in the evolution of aviation, and may I remark here 
that I believe all age-old things in a state of civilization must follow the great 
law of evolution as do all things in a state of nature. * * * But here is 
the big point — because space is pr;ictically unlimited the evolution of aviation 
has fewer limits than ground-held things. 

SMITHSONIAN SCIENTIFIC SEKIES 

In 1926 the Institution reached an agreement with a New York 
publishing firm for the issuance of a series of popular, illustrated 
volumes dealing with the branches of science covered by the activi- 



RErORT OF THE SECRETARY 9 

ties of the Smithsonian and its branches. The Institution receives a 
definite royalty from the sale of the books which provides greatly 
needed additional funds for the continuation of its researches. Vol- 
umes 1 to 4 were issued in 1929, and volumes 5 to 8 in 1930. The 
titles are as follows : 

1. The Smithsonian Institution, by Webster Prentiss True. 

2. Tlie Sun and the Welfare of Man, by Charles Greeley Abbot. 

3. Minerals from Earth and Sky. Part I, The Story of Meteorites, by George 

P. Merrill. Part II, Gems and Gem Minerals, by William F. Foshag. 

4. The North American Indians. An account of the American Indians north 

of Mexico, compiled from the original sources, by Rose A. Palmer. 

5. Insects : Their Ways and Means of Living, by R. E. Snodgrass. 
G. Wild Animals in and out of the Zoo, by William M. Mann, 

7. Man From the Farthest Past, by C. W. Bishop, C. G. Abbot, and A. flrdlicka, 

8. Cold-Blooded Vertebrates, by C. W. Gilmore, D. M. Cochran, and S. F. 

Hildebrand. 

Volumes 9, 10, and 11 were in press at the close of the year, and 
the manuscript of volume 12 was practically completed. 

The first edition of the series to be put on the market was a 
limited de luxe set known as the James Smithson memorial edition; 
this was quickly sold out. The publishers are now selling two dis- 
tinct editions known as the patrons' edition and the William Howard 
Taft memorial edition. 

RESEARCHES IN EUROPEAN ARCHI\TSS 

Dr. C. U. Clark continued his research work among the European 
archives under the grant furnished by Ambassador Charles G. 
Dawes in 1929. In addition to the important materials listed last 
year, Doctor Clark has made some very interesting new discoveries 
of manuscrii^ts relating to the ethnology of many tribes of North 
and South America. In the library at Evora in Portugal he brought 
to light a great many documents of unusual interest which had been 
deposited by Jesuit missionaries of the early colonial period in 
Brazil. In the British Museum Doctor Clark discovered some im- 
portant works of Francisco Cardenas relating to the Maya Indians 
of Yucatan. In addition to the new work in Portugal and Eng- 
land, Doctor Clark continued his researches in the archives of the 
Indies at Seville and in the Vatican Library and the Propaganda 
Fide in Eome. Insomuch as the Dawes fund will expire in Sep- 
tember, Doctor Clark will bring his work to a conclusion at that 
time. The results that have been obtained through this research 
have been exceptionally valuable, and the interesting material 
brought to light was considerably more than might have been 
expected. Although the research was undertaken primarily for the 
purpose of locating material on the Maya Indians of Yucatan, in 



10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

the course of the work documents of unusual interest were found 
which concerned tribes covering most of North and South America 
and the islands of the West Indies. 

COOPERATR'E ETHNOLOGICAL AND ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS 

In 1928 an appropriation of $20,000 was authorized by Congress 
for cooperative ethnological and archeological investigations in the 
United States. Proposed investigations were to be approved by the 
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, who allotted from this ap- 
propriation a sum equal to that raised for the work by the organiza- 
tion proposing it. Seven projects were approved during the past 
year and sums were allotted to them as follows : 

Allotments from the fund for cooperative ethnological and archeological 
itwestigations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1931 

1930 

July 3. Laboratory of Anthropology, to conduct archeological investigations 
of Basket Maker culture in the Guadalupe Mountain area of south- 
eastern New Mexico for the purpose of locating, exploring, and 
thoroughly examining both disturbed and undisturbed Basket Maker 
sites and establishing the principal characteristics of this area. 
A study and recording of pictographs found in this area will also 
be made, $900. 

July 8. University of Utah, to conduct archeological investigations and explora- 
tions in the State of Utah and the intensive excavation of one or 
two sites chosen as a result of the explorations, $800. 
1931 

Feb. 18. Laboratory of Anthropology, to continue the reconnaissance and 
excavation, where desirable, of Basket Maker sites in the Guadalui^e 
Mountains and adjacent sections on the north and west, $213.15 
(together with unexpended balance of $386.85 from previous allot- 
ment). 

Mar. 26. University of Utah, to conduct archeological investigations at 
Promontory Point, Great Salt Lake, Utah, and to continue the 
archeological reconnaissance begun in the fall of 1930 in the 
drainage of the Sevier River in west central Utah, $250. 

Mar. 26. Logan Museum, to conduct archeological investigations along the upper 
Missouri River, excavating earth-lodge villages belonging to the 
Arikara before 1850, $250. 

Apr. 21. The State Historical Society of Colorado, for a general investigation, 
reconnaissance, and mapping of the so-called Paradox Valley 
country with intensive work on a single site to be selected as a 
result of the i-econnaissance, $175. 

May 28. University of Denver, to complete the archeological survey of eastern 
Colorado begun during the summer of 1930, $250. 

At the beginning of the fiscal year the balance of the fund for 
cooperative ethnological and archeological investigations was very 
low, but by combining the unexpended balances on a number of the 
allotments it was possible to make the above grants. 



EEPORT OF THE SECRETABY 11 

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK 

Twenty-nine expeditions went out during the year in the interests 
of the Institution's investigations in geology, biology, anthropology, 
and astrophysics. Besides numerous localities in the United States, 
these expeditions visited many other parts of the world, including 
Africa, Alaska, Canada, China, Haiti, Santo Domingo, the South 
Sea Islands, Spain, and the West Indies. 

Many unique specimens were brought back to the Institution for 
study, and much-needed information was obtained in the field. 
The Smithsonian is indebted to its friends and to other scientific 
institutions for a considerable part of the expense of these expedi- 
tions, as its own meager funds for this purpose were exhausted early 
in the year. 

Among the year's expeditions I may mention particularly Dr. 
Paul Bartsch's third year of explorations for mollusks in the West 
Indies, this year's work covering the southern Bahamas, the islands 
off the south coast of Cuba, and the Caymans ; further anthropologi- 
cal researches in Alaska by Dr. Ales Hrdlicka and Henry B. 
Collins, jr.. Doctor Hrdlicka working along the Kuskokwim Eiver 
and Mr. Collins on St. Lawrence Island; biological collecting on 
" Tin Can Island " in the Tonga Archipelago by Lieut. Henry C. 
Kellers, United States Navy, through the cooperation of the Navy 
Department and the United States Naval Observatory; the Parish- 
Smithsonian expedition to Haiti, organized by the late Lee H. 
Parish with the financial assistance and cooperation of his father, 
S. W. Parish, for the purpose of making general biological collec- 
tions on the little-worked islands off the Haitian coast; and the 
continuation of the collecting explorations of the Rev. David C. 
Graham near Suifu, China, which resulted in over 62,000 specimens 
for the National Museum. 

Brief accounts of certain of the j^ear's expeditions will be found 
in the reports of the National Museum and the Bureau of American 
Ethnology appended hereto. All are described and illustrated in 
the Institution's yearly pamphlet. Explorations and Field Work of 
the Smithsonian Institution, 1930, publication No. 3111. 

PUBLIC ATIUKS 

On March 1, 1931, the editorial work of the Institution and its 
branches was consolidated in a central oiRce under the direction of 
the editor of the Institution. The steadily increasing output of the 
Smithsonian made it desirable to centralize authority to a certain 
extent in the interests of a more uniform policy and style and to 
prevent duplication of effort in the keeping of financial and other 
records. The volume of work passing through the editorial office 



12 ANNUAL EEPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

will be apparent from the fact that nearly $120,000 is now sjjent for 
printing each year; at certain periods of the year as many as 60 
separate publications are in press at one time, some of them con- 
taining hundreds of manuscript pages, and most of them highly 
technical papers requiring careful editing and proofreading. It is 
hoped that the increased efficiency from a business standpoint of 
the recent reorganization will result in releasing more time of the 
small editorial staff for straight editorial work, to the end that 
Smithsonian publications may appear with greater accuracy and 
prom.ptness. 

The Institution's publications constitute its primary means for 
accomplishing the diffusion of knowledge. They are issued by the 
Institution proper and by the bureaus under its administrative 
direction and appear in 13 distinct series, as follows: 

Smithsonian Institution : 

Annual report (with general appendix made up of selected articles review- 
ing the year's advances in science). 

Contributions to Knowledge (suspended). 

Miscellaneous eollections. 

Special puhlicatious. 
National Museum : 

Annual report. 

Bulletin. 

Proceedings. 

Contributions from the National Herbarium. 
Bureau of American Ethnology : 

Annual report (with accompanying papers on ethnological subjects). 

Bulletin. 
Astrophysical Observatory : 

Annals. 
National Gallery of Art: 

Catalogue. 
Freer Gallery of Art : 

Publications. 

Xinety-eight volumes and pamphlets were published during the 
year in these various series, and 205,711 copies of Smithsonian pub- 
lications were distributed. This number included 27,425 volumes and 
separates of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, 25,984 vol- 
umes and separates of the Smithsonian annual reports, 4,627 Smith- 
sonian special publications, 86,680 publications of the National 
Museum, and 29,475 publications of the Bureau of American Eth- 
nology. The titles and authors of the year's publications will be 
found in the report of the editor, Apf)endix 11. 

LIBRARY 

The Smithsonian library contains about 800,000 volumes, pam- 
phlets, and charts, pertaining largely to science and technology. It 
comprises 10 divisional libraries, one of which — the National Museum 



PEPOET OP THE SECRETARY 13 

library — includes 3G sectional libraries, the small working units 
maintained in the offices of the curators and other Museum officials. 
The year's accessions totaled 14,050, including 6,972 volumes and 7,078 
pamphlets and charts. Among the many gifts received during the 
year may be mentioned several thousand volumes and pamphlets 
from the library of the late Dr. George P. Merrill, presented by Mrs. 
Merrill and the other heirs; 600 scientific publications from Mrs. 
Dora W. Boettcher; and 386 volumes and pamphlets from the heirs 
of the late Dr. O. P. Hay. 

Work on the union catalogue progressed satisfactorily. The staft' 
completed the shelf list of the Museum library, catalogued tlie pub- 
lications of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and the John 
Donnell Smith collection, and made progress in reclassifying and re- 
cataloguing the library of the Freer Gallery of Art. A number of 
special activities were carried forward, such as the checking and com- 
pleting of sets of publications, the transfer to other organizations of 
certain publications not needed at the Institution, and the exchange 
of duplicate publications for others needed to complete sets. 

GOVERNMENTALLY SUPPORTED BRANCHES 

NATIONAL MUSEUM 

The appropriations for the maintenance of the Museum totaled 
$830,394, which included provision for four additional employees, 
namely, an associate director, a clerk in the library, and two guards. 
Although these additions are of great help to the efficient operation 
of the Museum, there are still many offices, particularly in the scien- 
tific departments, where the need for more workers is urgent. The 
second deficiency bill for 1931 carried $10,000 for the preparation of 
preliminary plans for the two wings to be added to the Natural 
History Building under an authorization by Congress in the pre- 
%Tious year. These plans, in course of preparation by the Allied 
Architects Incorporated, will provide for two wings similar in 
arrangement to the present building, that is, with the ground floor 
and the third floor devoted to offices and laboratories and the two 
floors between occupied by exhibits. This additional space will 
relieve the present badly overcrowded condition in the natural his- 
tory department of the Museimi; a similar need for space will still 
exist, however, in the arts and industries department and the divi- 
sion of history, and it is hoped that buildings for these collections, 
which are of such great interest to the ^^ublic, may soon be provided. 

The year's additions to the collections exceeded in number those 
of any previous year in the Museum's history, reaching a total 
of 1,022,850 individual specimens. Gifts of duplicates to schools 
totaled 7,384 specimens, and 31,516 specimens were loaned to scien- 
tific workers outside of Washington. 



14 ANNUAL REPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

The department of anthropology received additional ethnological 
material from Alaska resulting from the explorations of Dr. Ales 
Hrdlicka and H. B. Collins, jr., giving the Museum the most 
complete collection in existence of the ancient ivory culture of the 
Bering Sea region. About 5,000 specimens illustrating the life of the 
American Indian were received as a bequest from the late Victor J. 
Evans, of Washington. Further material representing the native 
tribes of West Africa was given by C. C. Roberts. 

The most important accession in the department of biology was 
the Barnes collection of Lepidoptera, purchased by a special appro- 
priation of $50,000 to the Department of Agriculture and transferred 
to the Museum. Additional material has been received as a result 
of the field activities of Dr. David C. Graham in China and of Dr. 
Hugh M. Smith in Siain. Dr. H. C. Kellers obtained large collec- 
tions of material for the Museum from the island of Niuafoou in the 
Pacific. A large collection of birds, mammals, reptiles, and plants 
obtained by E. G. Holt on an expedition to the boundary region be- 
tween Venezuela and Brazil was presented by the National Geo- 
graphic Society. 

Thirty-two species of minerals new to the collection were received 
by the department of geology, chiefly by purchase through the 
Roebling fund. Other interesting accessions included a large mass 
of native silver and calcite estimated to contain 220 pounds of pure 
silver; a vertebra of an extinct reptile, which has fossilized into opal; 
and a green tourmaline weighing 17.9 carats, purchased through the 
Chamberlain fund. Many valuable fossil specimens were added dur- 
ing the year, particularly through the explorations of C. W. Gilmore 
and Dr. J. W. Gidley. 

In the arts and industries department one of the most interesting 
accessions was the airplane Bremen^ the first heavier-than-air craft 
to make the east-west nonstop flight across the North Atlantic. This 
was deposited by the New York Museum of Science and Industry. 
Of especial interest also was a model showing a section of the Cono- 
wingo hydroelectric generating station, presented by the Philadelphia 
Electric Co. The division of graphic arts received a miniature book. 
The Gospel of St. Matthew, printed in 2V2-point type, the smallest 
type ever cast. Among the especially interesting accessions in the 
division of history were a chair owned by Benjamin Franklin, a 
chair belonging to President James Madison, and a mahogany screen 
owned by George Washington. 

In search of specimens and information needed in the progress of 
the scientific investigations carried on by the Museum many expedi- 
tions were in the field during the year, financed either by the Smith- 
sonian Institution or by contributions from interested friends. The 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 15 

results of the researches of the staff were published by the Museum 
in 7 volumes and 41 separate papers. The distribution of its publica- 
tions totaled 86,680 copies. The number of visitors during the year 
was 1,669,140. 

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART 

Three exhibitions were held in the gallery during the year : A 
collection of 78 water colors by William Spencer Bagdatopoulos, a 
memorial exhibition of water colors by Henry Bacon, and the fortieth 
annual exhibition of the Society of Washington Artists. 

Art works received by the Institution, subject to transfer to the 
national gallery upon approval of the National Gallery of Art Com- 
mission, included several portraits, among them a portrait of Com- 
modore Stephen Decatur by Gilbert Stuart, bequeathed by the late 
Stephen Decatur Parsons. Among the loans accepted by the gallery 
were 15 paintings by British and Dutch masters lent by the execu- 
tors of the estate of the late Henry Cleveland Perkins, and five 
paintings by old masters lent by Mrs. Marshall Langhorne. 

Four paintings were purchased during the year from the Henry 
Ward Ranger fund by the Council of the National Academy of 
Design. Under the conditions of Mr. Ranger's will, the National 
Gallery may claim any of the pictures thus purchased during the 
5-year period beginning 10 years after the artist's death and ending 
15 years after his death. 

The director. Professor Holmes, calls attention to the fact that just 
60 years have passed since he first entered the doors of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, where he was almost immediately employed as an 
artist. It may be added that since that time, except for short periods 
of connection with other organizations, he has remained with the 
Smithsonian and has served it with marked success in the fields of 
geology and anthropology as well as of art. To few men is it given 
to achieve distinction in three major fields of activity and to con- 
tinue at the age of 85 in the able direction of such an important 
enterprise as the National Gallery of Art. 

FREER GALLERY OF ART* 

Additions to the collections by purchase include a Chinese bronze 
vessel of the fifth century B. C. ; two Chinese jade ornaments of 
the third century B. C. ; Nepalese, Persian, and Arabic manuscripts ; 
and Chinese, Indian, Nepalese, and Persian paintings. 

1 The Governmpnt's expense in connection with the Freer Gallery of Art consists mainly 
In the care of the building and certain other custodial matters. Other expenses are paid 
from the Freer endowmennt funds. 



16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

The year's curatorial work embraced the studying and recording 
of inscriptions and seals on recently acquired Chinese paintings and 
of Buddhist inscriptions on stone sculptures and votive bronze 
images. The cataloguing of the near eastern section of manuscripts 
and paintings was completed. Translation of the Persian texts has 
identified more than 60 Persian miniatures taken from various early 
manuscripts. Translations have also been made of inscriptions on 
objects submitted by outside persons and by other institutions for 
expert opinion. A total of 2,312 objects and 107 photographs of 
objects were sent in for such opinion. 

Important changes in exhibition were made during the year. 
Galleries I and II are now devoted to the display of works of art 
from the Near East and India; gallery XIV now contains ancient 
bronzes, silver, and silver gilt; gallery XVIII exhibits scroll paint- 
ings; and gallery XIX displays pottery, porcelain, and panel 
paintings. 

The total attendance for the year was 125,789 ; of these 1,510 came 
to the office in connection with studies or for other special purposes. 
Fifty-two groups were given decent service in the galleries and 
10 classes were given instruction in the study room. 

In spite of existing difficult conditions, the gallery's expedition 
in China under direction of C. W. Bishop carried out important 
excavations in southwestern Shansi. The principal aim of the 
gallery in this work is to help establish an atmosphere of greater 
mutual regard and confidence between native and foreign scientists. 

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY 

The bureau continued its diversified researches among the Indians 
in various parts of the United States and at one locality in Canada. 
The chief of the bureau, M. W. Stirling, visited several sites of 
archeological interest in Florida and chose for excavation a large 
sand burial mound on Blue Hill Island in the Ten Thousand Islands 
group off the west coast. He then investigated several sites on the 
island of Haiti in company with H. W. Krieger, of the National 
Museum. Returning to Florida, work was continued in the eastern 
part of the State, in the course of which two series of large geometric 
earthworks were discovered on the eastern side of the Everglades. 

Dr. John R. Swanton was engaged in field work among various 
tribes in Louisiana during the first part of the fiscal year, and later 
devoted considerable time in Washington to the editing of Gatschet's 
material on the Atakapa language. Dr. Truman Michelson worked 
among the Kickapoo and Cheyenne of Oklahoma and the Fox of 
Iowa. John P. Harrington prepared his report on the San Juan 



EEPOKT OF THE SECEETAllY 17 

Indians of California, and later in the year returned to that State 
to continue his studies, this j'ear on the Esselen and Antoniano 
Indians in the southern part of Monterey County. 

Dr. F. H. H. Roberts, jr., concluded his excavations begun the pre- 
vious year at a site on the Zuili Reservation, N. Mex., and later in the 
year began work on the ruins of a large pit-house village near 
Allantown, Ariz. J. N. B. Hewitt again visited the Grant of the 
Six Nations of the Iroquois on the Grand River in Ontario, Canada, 
and briefly the Tuscarora reservation in western New York State, 
in connection with the Iroquois texts which he is preparing for 
publication. Winslow M. Walker was added to the bureau stall as 
associate anthropologist in March, 1931. Toward the end of the 
year he left Washington to investigate a number of caves near 
Gilbert, Ark., and on June 30 the work was still in progress. Miss 
Frances Densmore continued her study of Indian music for the 
bureau, working particularly with the Chippewa on Lake Superior 
and the Seminole of Florida. 

The bureau issued two annual reports and three bulletins during 
the year and distributed 20,475 copies of its publications. 

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES 

The exchange service handles for the United States the official 
exchange with all other countries of parliamentary documents, 
departmental documents, and miscellaneous scientific and literary 
publications. 

The number of packages of such publications handled during the 
year was 641,338, a decrease of 53,327 from the previous year; the 
weight of this material was 642,190 pounds, a decrease of 65,904 
pounds. 

As usual, aid was given the Library of Congress in procuring 
needed foreign publications, as well as a number of other establish- 
ments here and abroad in obtaining specially desired publications. 

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK 

The year has been marked at the Zoo by an unusually large 
number of accessions and by the opening of the new reptile house, 
enabling the park for the first time to exhibit these interesting 
creatures. The year's accessions totaled 1,266 animals, while 761 
were lost through death, exchange, or return of animals on deposit, 
leaving a total of 2,501 in the collection at the close of the year. 
The outstanding accession of the year was the bequest of the Victor 
J. Evans collection of 244 animals, representing 133 species, which 
composed Mr. Evans's private zoo and which contained a number 



18 ANNUAI, REPORT SMITHSONIAN" INSTITUTION, 19 31 

of rarities. To illustrate the unusual importance of the year's 
additions, it may be said that 63 species were shown for the first 
time in the National Zoological Park. 

Visitors to the park totaled 2,171,515, a slight decrease from the 
previous year's total. The fact that there was not a greater decline 
in number of visitors, as there was in other similar institutions owing 
to the present economic depression, was due to the great public in- 
terest shown in the new reptile exhibits. Attendance of school 
groups numbered 649 from 21 States, comprising 34,026 individuals. 

The new reptile house was opened on February 27, 1931, with a 
reception attended by 3,000 people. The building contains special 
lighting and ventilating systems and all the modern features known 
for the best exhibition of animals. Since its opening it has become 
the most popular building in the entire park. The most urgently 
needed additional building is one for small mammals and the great 
apes; plans for this building are now being prepared under an 
appropriation by Congress for the purpose. 

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY 

A large part of the year's work was devoted to the preparation 
of text, tables, and illustrations for Volume V of the Annals of 
the Astrophysical Observatory, which will cover the results of 
observations made at the several stations since August, 1920. The 
entire manuscript was sent to the printer toward the end of June. 

The three stations at Montezuma, Chile, Table Mountain, Calif., 
and Mount Brukkaros, Southwest Africa, have continued observa- 
tions of the radiation of the sun on all possible days. The results 
from the last two stations have not proved as satisfactory as those 
from Montezuma, and considerable effort has been expended on im- 
proving them. During the year new varieties of the short method 
of determining the solar constant of radiation, applicable to condi- 
tions at Table Mountain and Mount Brukkaros, have been worked 
out, with resulting great improvement in the values from these two 
stations. 

Upon the completion of the reduction of all the solar constant 
observations from the three field stations interesting results have 
been derived from their comparison. Whereas the probable error 
of the monthly mean values since 1920 is less than 0.1 per cent, 
the extreme range of the solar-constant values is 2.8 per cent. The 
march of solar variation since 1920 may be expressed very faith- 
fully as the sum of five regular periodicities of 68, 45, 25, 11, and 
8 month intervals. The curve of temperatures at Washington, D. C, 
and Williston, N. Dak., may also be represented by the sum of 
these same periodicities with the addition of an 18-month period. 



REPOET OF THE SECRETARY 19 

These results are so striking as to offer great hope that the rela- 
tionship between solar variation and the weather may enable the 
skilled meteorologist to forecast principal changes of weather far in 
advance. 

In the hope of finding a site as satisfactory as Montezuma, Chile, 
for solar observations, an expedition supported by John A. Roebling 
and headed by A. F. Moore is now in the field testing various locali- 
ties in Africa and outl.ying regions. 

DIVISION OF RADIATION AND ORGANISMS 

During the second year of the existence of the Division of Radia- 
tion and Organisms, under direction of Dr. F. S. Brackett, a num- 
ber of researches in physics and chemistry in connection with bio- 
physics were begun. The phototropic experiments upon oat coleop- 
tiles initiated during the previous year were continued with refine- 
ment of technique by Doctors Johnston and McAlister. The purpose 
of this investigation was to determine the phototropic response of 
the oat coleoptile toward light of different colors, or of different 
spectral regions, by means of light filters, and this year's more elab- 
orate experiments showed results in striking agreement with the 
rougher results of the previous year. 

Preliminary experiments on the carbon dioxide assimilation of 
wheat plants were conducted by Doctor Johnson and Mr. Hoover, 
using special all- vitreous growth chambers. Entire plants are used 
instead of individual leaves as in earlier work, and a typical day's 
run of the recording apparatus shows the carbon dioxide assimilated 
for different light intensities. Equipment is being developed for 
more elaborate experiments using approximately monochromatic 
light. 

Through the cooperation of tlie Department of Agriculture, Doc- 
tor Meier has carried out preliminary experiments on the growth 
of algse under controlled illumination and temperature conditions, a 
part of her work as National Research Council Fellow in the division. 
By the use of a large quartz spectrograph, the modifications in 
growth rate or resulting death point may be observed comparatively 
for different wave lengths of light. 

With the further cooperation of the Department of Agriculture, 
in connection with the crop physiology and breeding investigations 
of Doctor Swingle, of the Bureau of Plant Industry, Doctor Meier 
and members of the division have carried on researches on the effects 
of controlled radiation, humidity, and temperature on certain tropi- 
cal and xerophytic plants. It was found possible to maintain con- 
ditions that yielded for date palms ten times greater growth rate 
102992—32 3 



20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONH.N INSTITUTION^ 19 31 

than that of control plants in the greenhouse. Other interesting 
results were also obtained, which, if applicable to palms, as seems 
likely, would be of considerable practical importance. 

In the field of pure physics and physical chemistry, the intensity 
distribution in the mercury spectrum has been determined directly, 
and in cooperation with the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory the 
spectra of HCl, HON, and the halogen substitution products of 
benzene have been investigated in the region between the visible 
and 2/x. This work has been done by Doctors McAlister and Wulf 
and Mr. Liddel. 

Several additional rooms have been prepared and equipped for the 
use of the division. The research field of the division is so wide 
and interesting both to pure science and agriculture that a con- 
siderable expansion of its resources and personnel is greatly to be 
desired. 

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE 

In compliance with the resolution passed at the last international 
convention held in Brussels in July, 1922, the United States bureau 
of the catalogue has been kept in existence pending resumption of 
publication, and the compiling of necessary records of current Ameri- 
can scientific publications has been continued so that they may be 
indexed when publication is resumed. 

Every effort is being made by the United States bureau, through 
the chairman of the executive committee of the catalogue, to hasten 
the necessary reorganization, but the financial depression and other 
unfavorable conditions have so far prevented the development of a 
definite plan. Besides the necessary cooperation of the regional bu- 
reaus, all that is needed to put the enterprise on its feet is a capital 
fund of $76,000, to refinance the central editing and publishing 
bureau. 

NECROLOGY 

FRANK WIGGLESWORTH CLARKE 

Frank Wigglesworth Clarke, honorary curator in the Division of 
Mineralogy, United States National Museum, since 1883, died at his 
home in Washington on May 23, 1931, in his eighty-fifth year. Doc- 
tor Clarke was chief chemist at the United States Geological Survey 
from 1883 to 1925, when he retired from active service. 

The mineral collection in the National Museum had been recognized 
as a distinct entity for but a short time prior to Doctor Clarke's ap- 
pointment as honorary curator. He laid the foundation for these 
now justly celebrated mineral and gem collections. In addition to 



KEPORT OF THE SECEETAEY 21 

his duties at the survey, he devoted much time and effort to the up- 
building and care of these collections, the early reports of the divi- 
sion testifying to his personal activities. His official retirement from 
the Government service did not affect his interest, which never 
flagged. He visited the department frequently, giving freely of the 
store of knowledge acquired by his long years of service. 

Doctor Clarke was also greatly interested in the collection of 
meteorites, was instrumental in adding to it a number of specimens, 
and prepared a catalogue which was published as a part of the 
Smithsonian Report for 1886, 

Doctor Clarke was a graduate of Harvard, had many honorary 
degrees, and was affiliated with several of the prominent scientific 
societies. He was the author of numerous papers, his Data of Geo- 
chemistry being a standard reference work. 

Respectfully submitted. 

C. G. Abbot, Secretary. 



APPENDIX 1 
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM 

Sir : I have the honor to submit the following report on the con- 
dition and operations of the United States National Museum for 
the fiscal j'^ear ended June 30, 1931 : 

The total appropriations for the maintenance of the National 
Museum for this period amounted to $830,394, an increase of $67,880 
over the appropriations for tlie 3^ear 1930. Of this amount $12,909, 
together with a small additional sum secured by readjustment in 
our salary rolls, provided salaries for four additional employees, 
namely, an executive officer to be associate director of the United 
States National Museum, a clerk in the librarj^, and two guards. 
The new positions provided mark a further advance in the building 
up of our staff, far too few in number at present for the needs of the 
Museum. 

The second deficiency act for the fiscal year 1931 included $3,596 
to cover increases in salaries occasioned by the Brookhart bill, which 
made adjustment in annual pay in certain minor grades. Congress 
further provided $11,875 for salary step-ups in connection with effi- 
ciency ratings, and $2,420 was received to cover reallocations made 
by the Personnel Classification Board. 

The sum of $1,000 was added for the purchase of additional books 
for the Museum library, making $3,000 available annually for that 
purpose. There was further allotted an increase of $1,000 for print- 
ing and binding for the National Museum. 

As noted in the report for last year, the second deficiency act for 
the fiscal year 1930 provided $3,500 toward the remodeling of the 
women's comfort room in the Arts and Industries Building, the 
expenditure of which came within the operations of the present fiscal 
year. Other additions under the heading of building repairs included 
$25,000 for the construction of overhead galleries for the study collec- 
tion of mammals and $7,000 for fire-protective measures in the 
aircraft building. 

In the appropriation for heating and lighting there was provided 
an additional $2,000 for the purchase of an electrically driven fire 
pump for fire protection in the Natural History Building. 

The second deficiency bill for 1931 carried provision for $1,620 for 
an additional clerk and $10,000 for the preparation of preliminary 
plans for additions to the Natural History Building. These expendi^ 
22 



EEJPORT OF THE SECRETARY 23 

tures will figure in the allotment of funds for 1932 and will be consid- 
ered in the annual report for that year. 

Requirements for additional funds for the National Museum follow 
lines indicated in previous annual reports. The question of further 
personnel continues to be one of paramount importance, as pressure 
for additional workers in the scientific, clerical, and custodial forces 
is constant and continued. Additions made to the staff in recent 
years have filled in at vital points, but many further positions remain 
to be provided before our organization can function with maximum 
efficiency. There are several large collections for which the Museum 
now has no curators. In some divisions assistants in professional 
grades are needed as understudies for older men who should be in a 
position to train successors in their particular fields. Clerical assist- 
ance is at a minimum everywhere and in several divisions no service of 
this kind is at present available. Further subprofessional workers also 
are needed and the work of the custodial services in our woodworking 
shops is behind. Temporary clerical and other assistance is provided 
as funds permit, but this is unsatisfactory, as there is much lost 
motion in giving necessary training to assistants who under civil 
service rules remain at most only six months. The gradual increase 
in staff that has come in recent years has been of great assistance, 
but additional employees in numerous places are still urgently 
needed. 

Additions to funds allotted for the purchase of books have been 
useful, but the appropriation available for this purpose should be 
increased to at least $5,000 a j^ear. Scientific books appear in steadily 
increasing numbers and at a cost considerably in advance of that of a 
few years ago, so that the money available for books is below our 
actual needs. Stimulus to the scientific work in the National Museum 
in the past few years is beginning to sho^A in steadily increasing 
amounts of manuscript for publication as the result of researches on 
the part of the staff. There should be an increase in the funds for 
printing and binding to allow this material to be published promptly, 
in order that it may be made available for use by the many persons 
interested. 

As in previous years our existing appropriations are taken up so 
largely with necessary routine expenditures that there is little money 
available that may be used in exploration and field work in connec- 
tion with the National Museum. Many friends and correspondents 
now make large additions to our collections annually, and the Smith- 
sonian Institution, from its private income, provides funds that are 
used in an exploration program of considerable importance. The 
Museum, however, should have in its appropriation adequate funds 
that would enable it to develop various field researches along logical 
and continuinir lines. 



24 ANNUAL REPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

ADDITIONS TO THE NATURAL HISTORY BUILDING 

In the report for last year there was a discussion of the Smoot- 
Elliott bill authorizing the extension of the Natural History Build- 
ing by adding wings at the east and west ends at a cost of $6,500,000, 
which was approved by the President on June 19, 1930. As men- 
tioned above, the second deficiency bill for 1931 carried $10,000 for 
the preparation of preliminary plans for these additions. The Allied 
Architects Incorporated, of Washington, D. C, have been selected by 
the executive committee of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare 
preliminary plans which will be ready for consideration at the time 
this report is published. Briefly it is planned to add to the present 
building so that it will extend through the available space from 
Ninth Street to Twelfth Street, the additional construction to dupli- 
cate in general arrangement the present building, with the ground 
floor and third floor devoted to offices and laboratories and the two 
intermediate floors given over to exhibits. In so far as modern 
advances in museum design are found applicable to our needs, they 
will be incorporated in the plans, and various facilities not at present 
available will be arranged. It is desired to so schedule the appro- 
priations covering this important matter that funds for the com- 
mencement of this work will be provided in the bill for the coming 
fiscal year. Delay will be highly embarrassing, since our collections 
in natural history have increased to a point where exhibition and 
laboratory space is now badly crowded, and under present conditions 
we must at times make refusal of valuable material that should be in 
the national collections. In recent years various expedients to pro- 
vide more space have been adopted, until now we have reached our 
limit of resources without additional construction. It will be 
observed in further paragraphs of this report that additions to the 
exhibition and study collections contained in the Natural History 
Building in the present fiscal year have reached the vast number of 
nearly 1,000,000 specimens. 

If the building program indicated can be carried out at this time 
there will be provided adequate quarters for the natural history col- 
lections. It must not be overlooked, however, that consideration 
must soon be given to further construction to house our highly 
valuable materials in arts and industries and in history. 

COLLECTIONS 

Additions to the collections of the National Museum during the 
fiscal year reached the total of 1,022,850 individual specimens, the 
major part of these coming, as in previous years, to the department of 
biology. The additions are far in excess of those of any previous 



■REPORT OF THE SECRETABY 25 

year in the history of the Museum and include individual specimens 
and collections of high value and great importance. Materials of 
various kinds received for examination and report during the year 
amounted to 1,297 lots, including many thousands of separate speci- 
mens. Gifts of duplicate materials to schools and other educational 
organizations included 7,384 specimens, while exchanges of dupli- 
cate materials with other institutions and individuals amounted to 
33,471 specimens, for which there was received in return material 
needed for our collections. Loans to scientific workers outside of 
Washington amounted to 31,516 specimens. 

Following is a digest of the more important accessions for the 
year in the various departments and divisions of the Museum. 

Anthropology. — Alaska again has yielded most important acces- 
sions to the department of anthropology, the material coming 
through explorations financed by the Smithsonian Institution. 
Doctor Hrdlicka this year visited the Kuskokwim Valley, the 
Alaska Peninsula, and adjacent islands, obtaining valuable materials 
from a region that so far has not been represented in our collections. 
Work was continued on St. Lawrence Island by Henry B. Collins, jr., 
who secured additional collections of value in connection with his 
previous materials from this area. Through our continuing pro- 
gram of exploration the Museum now possesses the most complete 
and valuable collection in existence of the ancient ivory culture of 
the Bering Sea region. 

Of equal importance in this department has been the bequest of 
the American Indian collection of the late Victor J. Evans, of Wash- 
ington. This collection, deposited by the executors of the Evans 
estate, Mrs. Victor J. Evans and Arthur L. Evans, numbers approx- 
imately 5,000 specimens, comprising costumes, weapons of war and 
the chase, pottery, basketry, domestic implements, oil paintings, and 
other valuable materials illustrative of the life of the American 
Indian, many of the objects being now impossible of duplication. 

A further collection from west Africa was received as a gift from 
C. C. Koberts, this material representing the native tribes of Ashanti, 
Benin, and the Gold and Ivory Coasts. The Carnegie Institution of 
Washington presented a miniature plaster model of the stucco- 
covered Pyramid E-VII sub at Uaxactun in Guatemala, the oldest 
known -example of Mayan architecture. Under the Bruce Hughes 
fund of the Smithsonian Institution there were obtained various 
antiquities from Mesopotamia and Persia for exhibition. ^Vs a gift 
from His Majesty George V of England there has come a chenille 
Axminster carpet made in 1851. 

Textiles, and bone, wood, and stone implements from caves in 
northeastern Arizona occupied by prehistoric Basket Maker and 



26 ANNUAL REPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

Pueblo peoples were presented by Charles L, Bernheimer, of New 
York City. The Archeological Society of Washington deposited a 
collection of flint and bone implements from caves near Sergeac, Dor- 
dogne, France, collected in 1930 during work of the American 
School of Prehistoric Research. A series of stone artifacts recovered 
at Monasukapanough, a prehistoric Indian village in Albemarle 
County, Va., was presented by D. I. Bushnell, jr. 

Biology. — The most important accession in the department of 
biology, and one of the most important from a scientific standpoint 
that has come to the Museum in recent years, was the Barnes col- 
lection of Lepidoptera, purchased by a special appropriation of 
$50,000 to the Department of Agriculture and transferred by that 
department to the National Museum. This collection, consisting 
principally of moths and butterflies from North America, was 
assembled by Dr. William Barnes, of Decatur, 111., during a lifetime 
of endeavor at an expense of several hundred thousand dollars, and 
is rich in material of value to the specialist. 

Dr. Paul Bartsch, curator of mollusks, traveling under the Walter 
Rathbone Bacon scholarship of the Smithsonian Institution, ob- 
tained extensive collections of mollusks from the West Indies. Ad- 
ditional important specimens in several groups have come from the 
field activities of Dr. David C. Graham in China and of Dr. Hugh 
M. Smith in Siam. Large and interesting series of specimens of 
various kinds were obtained by Dr. H. C. Kellers, United States 
Navy, while a surgeon on the United States Naval Observatory eclipse 
expedition to the island of Niuafoou in the Pacific, being the first 
material to be received by the Museum from that area. The 
National Geographic Society presented a large collection of birds, 
mammals, reptiles, and plants obtained by E. G. Holt, as leader of 
an expedition to the boundary region between Venezuela and Brazil. 
Much of this collection represents species not found hitherto in the 
national collections. 

Doctor Wetmore, assisted by F. C. Lincoln, of the Biological Sur- 
vey, obtained interesting collections, chiefly of birds and reptiles, in 
Haiti and the Dominican Republic. A collection of 3,800 eggs and 
12 nests of North American birds was presented by Gov. C. D. Buck, 
of Delaware. A further collection of birds was obtained by Doctor 
Wetmore in Spain during field work in the summer of 1930. The 
division of birds received 16 genera new to its collections, as well as 
330 species and subspecies not previously represented, a notable addi- 
tion to these large collections. Two eggs of the California condor, 
a species near extinction in the wild state, were received fi'om the 
National Zoological Park. 

A large sailfish caught by Hon. William R. Wood near the island 
of Sonora, Pearl Island group, Panama, was presented by Mr. Wood 



KEPORT OF THE SECRETARY 27 

to the Museum and has been mounted and placed on exhibition. It 
is of maximum size and is far larger than any other in our collec- 
tions. The Bureau of Fisheries, United States Department of Com- 
merce, transferred a large collection of fishes, principally from 
Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. 

Type specimens of annelids, sponges, sipunculid worms, and 
Crustacea were presented to the division of marine invertebrates, 
while 114 types of helminths from Prof, Edward Linton, and the 
entire collection of Dr. W. G. MacCallum, of Johns Hopkins Hos- 
pital, with various other type specimens from collaborators, were 
added to the section of helminths. 

Large collections of grasses from Japan, Madagascar, and else- 
where were transferred by the Department of Agriculture. A large 
series of specimens of cultivated plants came from the Brooklyn 
Botanic Garden. 

Geology. — Thirty-two mineral species new to the collections were 
obtained during the year, mainly through purchase under the 
Koebling fund. There were obtained also under this fund a large 
mass of native silver and calcite estimated to contain 220 pounds of 
pure silver, and a section of a vein of similar material carrying 190 
pounds of silver from the Keely mine in the cobalt district of 
Ontario, a large cut black diamond weighing 8.97 carats for the 
exhibition series, and the fossilized vertebra of an extinct reptile of 
large size that has been changed in fossilization to a fine quality of 
precious opal, a most unusual specimen. There was included also a 
flawless crystal of scapolite, said to be the largest crystal of this 
mineral yet found, two bowlders of precious jade, and a tourmaline 
weighing 401^ carats. The Chamberlain fund contributed to the 
Isaac Lea collection three Mexican opals of unusual color, a green 
tourmaline weighing 17.9 carats, five rubies from Siam, carved 
articles of jade, coral, rose quartz, and carnelian, and other interest- 
ing and valuable articles. 

Specimens of nine meteorites, added to the collection through 
exchange or purchase, include one complete iron weighing 23 pounds 
from near Santa Fe, N. Mex., and other valuable examples. A com- 
plete set of the potash minerals of the Carlsbad (N. Mex.) deposits 
was secured with the assistance of Dr. W. T. Schaller through the 
courtesy of the United States Potash Co. Silver, nickel, and cobalt 
minerals and ores from various localities in Ontario were collected 
during field work by the assistant curator of mineralogy. A set 
of platinum ores from South Africa was obtained through the 
cooperation of the Geological Survey of the Union of South Africa. 

Dr. A. F. Foerste contributed a series of 1,000 invertebrate fossils 
from the Silurian deposits of the Ohio Valley. Type material in 
Foraminifera was presented by Dr. J. A. Cushman, Mr. John W. 



28 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

Skiiuier, Mrs. F. B. Plummer, and Dr. T. Wayland Vaughan, Many 
valuable specimens, particularly of fossil mammals, were obtained 
from collections by C. W. Gilmore in the Eocene deposits of Wyo- 
ming, among them being several nearly complete skeletons that will 
eventually be mounted and placed on exhibition. There may be 
mentioned especially a nearly complete skeleton of Hyrachyus, a 
rhinoceroslike animal about the size of a tapir, a nearly complete 
skeleton of Orohi'ppus^ a small primitive horse, and two more or less 
complete crocodile skeletons; 38 turtles were obtained belonging to 
eight genera. Additional fossil horse material resulted from field 
explorations near Hagerman, Idaho, under Dr. J. W. Gidiey. 

The collection of fossilized tracks of animals was augmented by 
an unusually distinct dinosaur footprint from the Triassic of 
Virginia, presented by F. C. Littleton, of Aldie, Va. Fossil bird 
bones, types of new species described by Doctor Wetmore, were pre- 
sented by Dr. E. L. Troxell, of Trinity College, Hartford, Conn. 
To the exhibitions in the section of paleobotany there came a fine 
example of a fossilized tree from near Natchitoches, La., presented 
by George Williamson tlirough the interest of Prof. E. W. Berry. 

Arts and industries. — An important accession in the aircraft sec- 
tion was a series of objects illustrating the first use of aircraft for 
military purposes in the United States, relating to captive balloons 
used during the Civil War, the collection having come from Prof. 
Thaddeus S. C. Lowe, organizer of the first military balloon section 
of the Federal Army. The airplane Bremen, the first heavier-than- 
air craft to make a nonstop flight westward across the north Atlantic, 
was deposited by the New York Museum of Science and Industry. 
For the section of land transportation there was secured a coachee, 
or light family carriage, made in Philadelphia about 1783 that there 
is reason to believe was owned at one time by General Washington 
at Mount Vernon. An original Concord stage coach was deposited 
by Will Rogers and Fred Stone. The Philadelphia Electric Co., 
through its president, William H. Taylor, presented a model of a 
section of the Conowingo hydroelectric generating station on the 
Susquehanna River near Conowingo, Md. Another valuable acces- 
sion was an original horizontal stationary steam engine built in 1864 
in the shops of the United States Military Railroad Department at 
Alexandria, Va., presented to the Museum by the Southern Railway 
system. This engine was in operation for 58 years. 

The Pepperell Manufacturing Co. presented a model exhibit cover- 
ing the growth and manufacture of cotton. A number of interesting 
examples of hand-woven textiles from several individuals included a 
linen damask tablecloth woven in Vermont about 1780, the design 
being an illustration of Independence Hall, Philadelphia. This was 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 29 

presented by Mrs. Jennie Bancroft Alband. Dr. J. T. Lloyd pre- 
sented a hand prescription balance used many years ago by 
pharmacists. 

In the section of wood technology there were added important col- 
lections of woods from Jamaica collected by Gerrit S. Miller, jr., 
a set of woods from various localities obtained from the Field 
Museum of Natural History in exchange, and a series of 132 kinds 
of native woods presented by the Philippine Bureau of Forestry 
through A. F. Fischer. 

For the division of graphic arts there was obtained a miniature 
book, The Gospel of St. Matthew, printed from Si/o-point type, the 
smallest type that has ever been cast. The printed surface of the 
page measures 1% by 1% inches and has approximately 540 words 
to a page. 

The trustees of the Stephen H. Tyng Foundation of England have 
made the section of photography in the Smithsonian Institution 
the depository for duplicate pictorial prints procured by the founda- 
tion. The first installment of photographs from this source came 
during the year and will be followed by others. The works chosen 
are selected by the trustees of the foundation as representative 
works of outstanding pictorial merit produced b}^ the photographers 
of any nation. 

History. — In the antiquarian section a watch and a sword carried 
during the French and Indian War by Capt. Jeremiah Marston, of 
the British Armj'', were presented by Charles F. Clark. There came 
also a chair ov/ned by Benjamin Franklin, a chair of President 
James Madison, a mahogany screen belonging to General Washing- 
ton, and a cane made from a piece of one of the timbers of the 
U. S. S. C onstitutio7i by bequest from James C. McGuire. 

The aluminum ti-ansit used by Admiral Peary during his north 
polar expedition in 1898 was received as a gift from Mrs. William 
Porter Allen. A uniform worn during the Spanish-American war by 
Maj. Gen. Leonard W^ood was added to the collections as a gift by 
Mrs. Leonard Wood. An exceptionally interesting series of military 
uniforms and equipment was presented by the Rumanian Government 
through Dr. Andrei Popovici, secretary of the Rumanian Legation. 
A similar series of Turkish military arms and uniforms came as a 
gift from the Turkish Government through the Turkish ambassador, 
Ahmet Muhtar. 

For the numismatic collection there were obtained examples of 
current coins from the Governments of Estonia, Italy, Poland, and 
the Cameroons. A set of coins from Palestine was presented by 
P. Knabenshue, American consul general at Jerusalem. Numerous 
other coins from a large number of countries were transferred bv

the Department of State. The United States Treasury Department 
transferred to the national collections bronze copies of the gold 
medal awarded by Congress to Col. Charles A. Lindbergh in recog- 
nition of his services to the science of aeronautics and of the gold 
medal awarded by the Congress to Lincoln Ellsworth for his trans- 
polar flight in the dirigible Norge in May, 1926. The philatelic 
collections received 7,855 specimens during the year, the majority 
having come by transfer from the Post Office Department. 

CHANGES IN EXHIBITIONS 

In the paleontological series of the Museum exhibition the most 
important addition has been the installation of the large dinosaur 
Diplodocus longus^ collected at the Dinosaur National Monument, 
Utah. This specimen as mounted in our halls measures more than 
TO feet in length and stands 12 feet 5 inches high, with the head and 
neck rising to a still greater height. The base has been so arranged 
that at the shoulders and at the hips visitors may walk through 
beneath the skeleton. This specimen, found embedded in a very 
hard and difficult rock, has required nearly six years for preparation. 

An important change in the historical series has been the transfer 
of the costumes collection to a larger hall, where the cases containing 
the series of dresses of wives of the Presidents are now installed in 
a double row facing one another. This collection is one of the most 
popular in the Museum and shows to excellent advantage in the large 
space now available for it. 

The numismatic collections have been transferred to the smaller 
room formerly occupied by the costumes, where the light is much 
better, allowing the coin and medal series to be viewed more readily, 
especially on days when artificial light is necessary. The philatelic 
collection also has been moved to a location where it is much more 
easily available. 

EXPLORATIOXS AND FIEIJ) WORK 

Field investigations carried on as usual throughout the year have 
been concerned with a wide variety of interests, and though mainly 
in the biological field, have included those researches concerned with 
man and with fossil animals of various kinds, as well as with various 
groups in botany and zoology. The work has been financed princi- 
pally through grants from the general income of the Smithsonian 
Listitution, assisted by contributions from interested individuals, 
while certain projects were financed from special funds of the Insti- 
tution. Limited assistance has been given from the annual govern- 
mental appropriations of the National Museum, but aid from this 
source has been relatively small and has concerned only a few of tlie 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 31 

various projects. Additional money that ma}' be used for researches 
in the field is one of the principal needs of our organization. 

A brief account of field work for the present year follows : During 
the months of July, August, and September, the assistant curator 
of ethnology, Henry B. Collins, jr., assisted by J. A. Ford, was 
engaged in field work on St. Lawrence Island in Bering Sea, 
in continuation of work begun earlier in the season. In 1928 and 
1929 Mr. Collins's excavations on Punuk and St. Lawrence Islands 
revealed the existence of a prehistoric phase of Eskimo culture ances- 
tral to the modern type of that region and derived apparently from 
a still earlier phase, known to students as the old Bering Sea culture. 
Stratigraphic excavations were made this year at Gambell and a long 
succession of cultural changes was revealed in detail as one village 
midden after another was trenched. Through this an excellent 
chronology was established on the basis of stratigraphy, the evidence 
of the old beach lines, and the demonstrable succession of art styles 
on implements, principally harpoon heads of walrus ivory. Inci- 
dental to this work Mr. Collins took occasion to secure an excellent 
collection of birds from this island, the bird life of which has been 
comparatively little known. The active interest of the Revenue Cut- 
ter Service in this work continued and was of invaluable assistance, 
particularly the transportation furnished on the cutter Northland to 
areas otherwise inaccessible. Cooperation from this source has been 
highly appreciated. 

The curator of ethnology, Herbert W. Krieger, engaged in a recon- 
naissance of an archeological nature in the Republic of Haiti, this 
work being carried on from January to May, 1931, when the approach 
of the rainy season brought it to a close. The present population 
of Haiti has no history or tradition regarding the early Indian occu- 
pants of the island, and is therefore of no assistance in locating 
former Arawak or Ciboney village sites and kitchen middens, so that 
one has to rely on Spanish and French narratives for the ethnologi- 
cal and historical introduction useful in this work. The reconnais- 
sance was highly successful in determining the distribution of former 
Arawak and Ciboney village sites, and it was found that scattered 
groups of each type occupied at different times much of the habitable 
portions of the island. A check was made also on data from Spanish 
writers who gave differing accounts with regard to the former pres- 
ence of a troglodytic population in the isolated mountains of the 
southwestern peninsula. 

As a further important result, this season's investigations estab- 
lished the identity of the Samana cave culture, investigated by a 
Smithsonian expedition in 1928, with the large shell middens on lie 
a Vache, on the Caribbean coast of Haiti. The same primitive, non- 
agricultural, non-Arawak Ciboney apparently are also responsible 



32 AK-]SrUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

for the large middens consisting primarily of conch shells {Strorribus 
gigas) recently discovered by Doctor Wetmore on Beata Island off 
the southern coast of Barahona Province, Dominican Republic. 
Cumulative evidence obtained during the current year and from 
previous Smithsonian expeditions links the culture of the West 
Indies with the Arawakan tribes of Venezuela and of the Guianas. 
There is also data to show that there was no direct tribal contact of 
these island Arawak with the tribes of southern Florida, although 
culturally in many ways they were closely associated. There seems 
to have been a vast overlapping of culture traits of the southeastern 
United States from the south, these trait complexes centering about 
the cultivation of maize and the production of pottery. In so far as 
cassava (yucca) formed a staple food, the former aboriginal culture 
traits are associated with those of the South American forested 
tropical lowlands. 

As in former years, the expedition headed by Mr. Collins was made 
possible by a Smithsonian grant, while that of Mr. Krieger was 
financed by Dr. W. L. Abbott. 

From April 21 to June 6, 1931, the assistant curator of archeology, 
F. M. Setzler, was engaged in archeological investigations in Texas, 
arranged in cooperation with the Bureau of American Ethnology 
of the Smithsonian Institution. After briefly examining several 
sites along the Gulf coast, he excavated four caves and one rock 
shelter in Presidio County and visited several other caves in that 
vicinity. From one large cave examples of aboriginal basketry, 
matting, cradles, sandals, and other materials were recovered. 
Although this site is only 150 miles east of a marginal Basket Maker 
culture, no trace was found of these early Southwestern people. The 
material exhumed by Mr. Setzler differs in some respects from any 
other in the Museum, and more research will be required before it 
can be identified definitely. He has prepared a preliminary report 
on this field work. 

Except for two weeks in October, 1930, J. Townsend Russell, jr., 
collaborator in Old World archeology, spent the year in Europe, 
where he continued archeological studies and participated in the 
excavations of the American School of Prehistoric Research at Castel 
Merle, in the Dordogne, France, and in Czechoslovakia. Toward 
the close of the fiscal year Mr. Russell was active in details looking 
toward a cooperative undertaking with the University of Toulouse 
for excavation of prehistoric sites in France, which will add de- 
cidedly to the collections of the National Museum in a field from 
which our Institution previously has had very little. These investi- 
gations are financed by a special fund for work in Old World 
archeology. 



REPORT OF THE SECBETAEY 33 

Dr. Ales Hrdlieka, curator of physical anthropology, left in May 
on a fourth expedition to Alaska, for the purpose of obtaining 
measurements and, if possible, casts of the few remaining full-blood 
Aleutians. He expected to work in the region of supposed contact 
between the Eskimo, the Aleut, and the Indian, and to examine the 
various mountain passes between Bering Sea and Cook Inlet and 
the Gulf of Alaska, through which migrations of early man from 
the Bering Sea area southward may have been possible. 

Dr. Paul Bartsch, through the Walter Rathbone Bacon Traveling 
Scholarship under the Smithsonian Institution, continued field work 
in the Vv^est Indian islands in a study of the terrestrial molluscan 
fauna of this area, completing a program of travel initiated two 
years ago. This year efforts were focused on the southern Bahamas, 
the islands off the south coast of Cuba, and the Cayman group. Doc- 
tor Bartsch was accompanied by three assistants, Harold Ciuttick, a 
student of George Washington University ; Ray Greenfield, who had 
been with him two years ago in Cuba ; and Alva G, Nye, jr., of Wash- 
ington. Harold Peters of the Bureau of Entomology, also accom- 
panied the party to collect specimens of avian parasites. The party 
left Miami, Fla., on June 9, 1930, in the Island Horae^ a 33-ton, shal- 
low-draft vessel. Work was carried through the islands and cays of 
the southern Bahamas until August 6, and then the party explored 
the wonderful molluscan fauna of Great Inagua Island, which 
proved by far the richest of all the Bahamas. On reaching Guanta- 
namo, Cuba, the Island Horiie was pronounced unseaworthy, and an- 
other boat the Jose Enrigue^ a 35-ton sloop with an auxiliary 22 
horsepower gasoline engine, was chartered at Santiago. On August 
28 the party continued through the keys along the south coast of 
Cuba, and from September 10 to September 17 was occupied on Cay- 
man Brae, Little Cayman, and Great Cayman islands. Sails were 
then set for Cuba, and until September 24 the keys along the coast 
from Cayo Largo to the Isle of Pines were searched. On Septem- 
ber 29 the port of Batabano, Cuba, was reached and the collections 
were shipped by rail to Habana. The expedition returned to Wash- 
ington on October 3. This cruise yielded a larger amount of mollus- 
can material than any of the previous trips, no less than 250,000 
specimens of mollusks being secured, together with many observa- 
tions on molluscan faunistic relations. Large collections in other 
groups were also obtained, among them 925 bird skins and 596 rep- 
tiles and amphibians, besides a number of live animals, principally 
reptiles, for the National Zoological Park. 

The Rev. David C. Graham, whose explorations in western 
Szechwan, China, and the neighboring regions of Tibet, have 
been a feature of these reports for many years, continued work near 



34 ANXTJAL EEPORT SMITHSOITIAN" INSTTTUTION, 1931 

Suifii, and forwarded to the National Museum large and important 
collections numbering in all 62,000 specimens, the greater part con- 
sisting of insects. His main trip during 1930 was an excursion into 
the unknown and difficult country south of Tatsienlu. 

Dr. J. M. Aldrich, in continuation of work which has extended 
over a period of many years, spent part of June and July, 1930, in 
making collections of Diptera in Idaho, Washington, California, and 
Colorado. He visited many type localities, and his collections for 
this season include a larger number of interesting forms than he has 
obtained before in a like period in the United States. 

Dr. Waldo L. Schmitt continued his investigations of the marine 
fauna at the Carnegie Marine Biological Station, Tortugas, Fla., 
from July 9 to August 8, 1930, through the cooperation of the 
Carnegie Institution of Washington, undertaking this year a pre- 
liminary investigation of the deeper water readily accessible to the 
laboratory. Among the prizes brought back were three specimens 
of the giant isopod Bathynomus^ the largest specimen being 10% 
inches long, and a new portunid crab of the genus Benthocascon, a 
group heretofore known only from a single specimen taken in the 
Andaman Sea, Indian Ocean. 

Dr. H. C. Kellers, United States Navy, through the courtesy of 
the Naval Observatory and the friendly cooperation of the Navy 
Department, was again detailed to act as representative of the 
Smithsonian Institution for the purpose of making biological collec- 
tions during the United States Naval Observatory eclipse expedition 
to Niuafoou, nicknamed " Tin-can Island," a partly submerged vol- 
canic crater situated between Samoa and Fiji. His collections in- 
clude 100 bird skins and over 7,000 alcoholic specimens of various 
kinds. 

Ernest G. Holt, under the auspices of the National Geographic 
Society, continued explorations along the Venezuelan-Brazilian 
boundary and returned with valuable collections, principally of birds, 
reptiles, amphibians, and plants which have been presented to the 
National Museum by the society. In the preliminary examination 
of this material many forms not before represented in our collections 
have been found. The material is particularly welcome, as the 
Museum has previously had but little from this region. 

Because of association in the work of the National Herbarium 
it is proper to mention field investigations by Mrs. Agnes Chase, of 
the Department of Agriculture, who collected in the Eastern Shore 
region of Maryland for the purpose of studying the distribution of 
certain coastal plain species of grasses, and by Jason R. Swallen, 
who spent about three months in the region from Tennessee to Texas 
and northeastern Mexico studying the ranges of grasses. 



EEPOET OF THE SECRETAHY 35 

Gerrit S. Miller, jr., visited Jamaica from February to April with 
the special object ol" determining whether or not bones of rodents or 
other mammals that are now extinct might be found in the village 
middens of the pre-Columbian Arawaks. Several kitchen middens 
were investigated and much material bearing on the food habits of 
the aboriginal inhabitants was obtained. Miscellaneous collections 
of various kinds also were made, particularly of plants, reptiles, and 
Arawak artifacts. 

Dr. A. Wetmore, accompanied by Frederick C. Lincoln, of the 
Bureau of Biological Survey, collected from the middle of March 
until the end of May in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, continu- 
ing the biological survey of Hispaniola that has been under way 
for several years. The first work was done in the region of Fort 
Liberte in the north, where they were accompanied by S. W. Parish 
and by M. W. Stirling, Chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology, 
who were traveling with Mr. Krieger to examine archeological sites 
that the latter had under investigation in that area. Keturning to 
Port-au-Prince, Doctor Wetmore, through the courtesy of the United 
States Marine Corps, made a reconnaissance by airplane of the La 
Hotte Mountains of southwest Haiti, securing information that gov- 
erned later travel by pack train in this area and the ascent of Pic de 
Macaya, the highest mountain in this complex. On arrival again 
at the coast a visit was made to He a Vache to supplement collections 
made there last year by the Parish expedition. 

Returning to Port-au-Prince, Doctor Wetmore and Mr. Lincoln 
traveled by auto through the mountains to Barahona, in the Domini- 
can Republic, where they secured a small sloop and continued to 
Beata Island, a little-known island where new forms of birds, rep- 
tiles, and land shells were obtained and an extensive series of Indian 
shell mounds was examined. Work in the Dominican Republic 
was made possible through letters given by General Rafael Trujillo, 
President of the Republic, to whom all thanks are due for this 
invaluable assistance. 

Edward P. Henderson, assistant curator of mineralogy, under the 
auspices of the Roebling fund, spent a month in the well-known 
silver and nickel camps of Ontario, Canada. Starting from Toronto, 
he first visited the cobalt district, 300 nules to the north, where rich 
silver masses and their associations were acquired. Sudbury, the 
most important nickel district in the world, was next visited. Here 
a quantity of nickel ore and its minerals was obtained. The pegma- 
tite dikes of the Province at Bancroft yielded recently described 
materials lacking in our collections. The hearty cooperation of the 
mining companies, quarry owners, and the staif of the Royal Ontario 
Museum of Mineralogy was largely responsible for the success of 
102992—32 4 



36 AN"NUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN" INSTITUTION, 19 31 

the trip. Later m the year Mr. Henderson made a brief trip to some 
of the noted mineral localities in North Carolina to obtain material 
needed for the study of particular problems. 

Dr. C. E. Resser spent about four months in the field, working 
first in the Grand Canyon, in Arizona, under the auspices of the Car- 
negie Institution. The second phase of his work led diagonally 
across the State of Arizona on a rapid reconnaissance, followed by a 
return to the Grand Canyon for further studies. In this he was 
accompanied by Dr. A. A. Stoyanow, of the University of Arizona, 
and by members of the Park Service, who aided in his investigations. 
Early in July, starting from Salt Lake City, where Dr. R. Endo 
became a member of the partj^, work began on the local geology 
about Delta, Utah, where the party was accompanied by Frank 
Beckwith, with a profitable visit to Zion Canyon. Thence the course 
lay north to the Tetons and other places in the vicinit}'' of Yellow- 
stone National Park. During investigations at those places. Dr. 
and Mrs. Curt Teichert joined the party. Rain interfered mate- 
rially with travel and work ; and since matters of moment requiring 
attention arose at the Museum, work was closed for the season. 
Travel from Salt Lake City was by truck, the entire trip home being 
made by this means. The season as a whole was most profitable 
in the knowledge gained of the various geologic strata, although not 
many fossils were secured, as the strata studied are for the most part 
nonfossiliferous. 

Since the field exploration in charge of C. W. Gilmore extended 
into the present year, but brief mention was made of it in last year's 
report. This exploration in the Bridger (Eocene), in the Bridger 
Basin, southwestern Wyoming, met with unusual success in the 
acquisition of large and representative collections. Some of the 
outstanding specimens have been mentioned elsewhere in this report. 
The collection as a whole gives the division a good representation of 
the Bridger fauna and in all probability contains many undescribed 
forms, being particularly rich in mammals. Its value was further 
enhanced by the cooperation of Dr. W. H. Bradley, of the United 
States Geological Survey, who secured the necessary data for a 
large-scale map, which, with his geological sections, insures the ac- 
curate placing of the specimens both geographically and geologically. 
George F. Sternberg, as in pre^dous seasons, rendered efiicient serv- 
ice, and George B, Pierce ably assisted as field assistant. At the 
close of the fiscal year Mr. Gilmore, again accompanied by Mr. 
Sternberg, was in the field in Montana and Wyoming. 

Although work at the fossil locality near Hagerman, Idaho, was 
very successful in the season of 1929, the results of the 1930 expedi- 
tion under Dr. J. W. Gidley exceeded it in both quantity and quality, 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 37 

as some of the best material found in the deposit was obtained near 
the close of operations. Camp was established early in May and 
work was begun where operations had closed the previous season. 
Two months' additional work fully confirmed the opinion that this 
fossil bone deposit is one of the most important discoveries in the 
field of vertebrate paleontology in recent years. Associated with 
the abundant horse remains were found bones of beaver, otter, 
mastodon, peccary, and others. The collecting for the season was 
brought to a close early in July, but the field was still so promising 
that a third expedition was undertaken m the spring of 1931, under 
N. H. Boss, chief preparator in the division of vertebrate paleon- 
tology. This party was still in the field at the close of the fiscal year 
so that its results will come properly in the report for next year. 

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT 

Usual routine repairs have been necessary in connection with the 
buildings of the National Museum to keep them in proper condition. 
In the Natural History Building the auditorium was painted, as 
were also the corridors surrounding it. A considerable amount of 
painting was done in ranges in halls on the first and second floors, 
many of which had not been painted since the completion of the 
building nearly 20 years ago. Metal and wooden window frames 
were painted, as were also the walls and floors of the engine room. 
A revolving door was installed at the north entrance, a needed 
improvement particularly in the winter season. 

Steel galleries were erected in two ranges on the ground floor and 
in certain adjacent rooms that provide housing for the study collec- 
tions of mammals which have been stored temporarily in two exhibi- 
tion hails on the second floor. Necessary plans and specifications for 
this work were prepared by the engineering division of the Office 
of Public Buildings and Public Parks. The work of erection of the 
galleries began on April 15, 1931, and was well along toward comple- 
tion at the close of the fiscal year. 

In the Arts and Industries Building various exhibition halls were 
reconditioned during rearrangement of some of the exhibits, and the 
women's comfort room was enlarged and remodeled. In the Aircraft 
Building a sprinkler system and other fire safeguards were installed. 
The building was repainted within and without and a concrete base 
was built at the bottom of the sloping sides around the entire 
exterior. 

In the rooms occupied by the National Museum in the Smithsonian 
Building walls and ceilings in 12 rooms in the division of plants were 
repainted, and insulating material to control excess summer heat and 



38 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

excess heat radiation m winter was installed in the ceiling in the 
main herbarium hall. 

The power plant was in operation from September 29, 1930, until 
Jilay 27, 1931. The consumption of coal during the year was 3,329 
tons, at an average cost per ton of $5.65. The amount required was 
somewhat less than that of last year, due primarily to the mild winter, 
and secondarily to the fact that some of our electric current was 
purchased from the Potomac Electric Power Co., thus relieving the 
load on the boilers at such times as all of the exhaust steam was not 
needed for heating the Natural History Building. The Steamboat 
Inspection Service has examined the boilers and tb-"". elevators have 
been regularly inspected by the District of Columbia inspector. The 
total electric current produced amounted to 613,000 kilowatt-hours, 
manufactured at a cost of 1.78 cents per kilowatt-hour, including 
interest on the plant, depreciation, repairs, and material. In addi- 
tion electric current to the amount of 73,250 kilowatt-hours was pur- 
chased and used in the exhibition halls of the Arts and Industries 
Building. Needs for electrical current are steadily increasing, par- 
ticularly to iDrovide favorable lighting in our exhibition halls during 
dark days in winter, and increased purchases will be required in the 
future. 

The ice plant manufactured 406.8 tons of ice, at an average cost 
of $] .67 per ton, a reduction from the expense for the previous year. 
With the plant operating at full capacity it is not practicable at the 
present time to manufacture the entire amount of ice required during 
the hottest weather of summer, so that it is necessary to purchase a 
certain amount at that time. 

During the year 20 exhibition cases and bases, 439 pieces of storage, 
laboratory, and other furniture, and 1,667 drawers of various kinds 
were added, the greater part of these being manufactured in our 
shops. 

MEETINGS AND BECEPTIONS 

The lecture rooms and auditorium were used during the present 
year for 103 meetings, covering the usual wide range of activities. 
Government agencies that utilized these facilities for hearings, meet- 
ings, lectures, and other special occasions included the Bureau of 
Agricultural Economics, the Plant Quarantine and Control Adminis- 
tration, the Forest Service, the Bureau of Dairy Industry of the 
department of Agriculture, and the United States Public Health 
Service. In addition a meeting was arranged by the Director of 
Scientific Work of the Department of Agriculture for an address 
bj^ Dr. Samuel C. May, of the University of California, on the work- 
ings of the Government. There were various conferences held from 



REPORT OF THE SECIiETARY 39 

June 16 to 23 in connection with the Fifth National Farm Girls 
and Boys 4-H Club Camp. The Department of Agriculture Grad- 
uate School also utilized the auditorium for an address by Dr. E. A. 
Fischer, of the Rothamsted Experiment Station, on statistics. The 
scientific societies that met regularly in the auditorium or small 
lecture room included the Vivarium Society, the Entomological 
Society of Washington, the Society for Philosophical Inquiry, the 
Anthropological Society of Washington, and the Helminthological 
Society of Washington. Meetings were also held by the Wild Flower 
Preservation Society (Inc.), the Audubon Society of the District 
of Columbia, the Biological Societ}'^ of Washington, and the Potomac 
Garden Club. 

The National Association of Retired Federal Employees held 
regular meetings during the year, and there was one meeting of the 
Smithsonian Relief Association. The National League of Com- 
mission Merchants met on December 17 under the auspices of the 
Bureau of Agricultural Economics for the purpose of explanation 
of the provisions of the recently enacted perishable agricultural 
commodities act. The Maryland-Virginia Farmers' Marketing Asso- 
ciation met on February 12 to discuss plans for a farmers' market. 
Dr. Arthur A. Allen, of Cornell University, lectured on Februar^^ 
23 before the Audubon Society of the District of Columbia on 
native birds and their advantages on golf courses. Dr. Raymond 
L. Ditmars lectured before the Biological Society of Washington on 
February 28 on reptiles. 

The American College of Physicians during its fifteenth annual 
clinical session met in the auditorium on March 28 for an address 
by Dr. Ales Hrdlicka on the diseases of the human race. 

On April 13 there was held the eighth national and sixth inter- 
national oratorical contest for the Evening Star area for contestants 
from private and parochial schools of Washington. This was fol- 
lowed on ?»Iay 8 by the second zone finals for the same contest. 

On April 28 the Bureau of Dairy Industry, United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, held a meeting of the International Association 
of Milk Dealers. On May 18 the Carnegie Institution of Washington 
arranged an address by Sir James H. Jeans, of the Royal Society of 
London, on Out in the Depths of Space. On May 19 there was an 
address by Dr. M. A. Grossman, of the Republic Research Corpora- 
tion on Nitriding before the metallurgical advisory connnittee of the 
Bureau of Standards and the Washington-Baltimore Chapter of the 
American Society for Steel Treatiu^r. 

The seventh annual national spelling bee was held in the audi- 
torium on May 26, when the first prize of $1,000 was won by Ward 
Randall, of White Hall, 111. 



40 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

MISCELLANEOUS 

The exhibition halls of the National Museum were open during 
the year on week days from 9 a. m. to 4.30 p. m., except that the Air- 
craft Building, as has been noted, was closed for repairs for eight 
months during the year. Our Museum halls were also open on Sun- 
day afternoons from 1.30 p. m. to 4.30 p. m., with the exception of 
the Aircraft Building. All buildings remained closed during the 
day on Christmas and on New Year's. 

The flags on the Smithsonian and Museum Buildings were placed 
at half mast from 1.15 p. m. April 9 through April 11, out of respect 
for the late Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Hon. Nicho- 
las Longworth. During the forenoon of Memorial Day the flags 
also were held at half-mast. Visitors for the year totaled 1,669,140, 
a decrease of a little more than 230,000 from the record of the pre- 
ceding year, this difference being due partly to the fact that the Air- 
craft Building was closed for a considerable part of this period. 
Attendance in the several buildings in the National Museum was 
recorded as follows: Smithsonian Institution, 258,616; Arts and In- 
dustries Building, 731,186; Natural Histoiy Building, 631,498; Air- 
craft Building, 47,840. The average daily attendance for week days 
was 4,452, and for Sundays 5,472. 

During the year the Museum published 7 volumes and 41 separate 
papers, while the distribution of literature amounted to 86,680 copies 
of its various books and pamphlets. Additions to the Museum 
library, obtained partly by exchange, partly by donation, and partly 
by purchase, included 2,528 volumes and 832 pamphlets, an increase 
over those of the previous year. The library of the National Museum, 
as separate from that of the Smithsonian Institution proper, now 
contains 79,407 volumes and 109,129 pamphlets. Much progress was 
made during the year in the arrangement and cataloguing of these 
collections, not only in the main libraries but also in the 36 sectional 
libraries of the organization. Duplicate volumes in our series have 
been assembled and many have been distributed to other organiza- 
tions, either as gifts or as exchanges. 

On March 5, 1931, John E. Graf was appointed associate director 
of the National Museum under the assistant secretary. Mr. Graf 
came to the Museum by transfer from the Department of Agricul- 
ture, where he had long been connected with the administration of 
the Bureau of Entomology, in recent years as assistant chief. 

In the department of anthropology the former divisions of Ameri- 
can archeology and of Old World archeology were consolidated on 
February 1, 1930, as a division of archeology, under Neil M. Judd 
as curator. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 41 

On February 1, 1931, Dr. A. J. Olmsted, chief photographer, was 
appointed assistant curator of the section of photography under the 
division of graphic arts. 

Frank M. Setzler was appointed assistant curator of the division 
of archeology, August 16, 1930, and Gustav A. Cooper, assistant 
curator in the division of stratigraphic paleontology on October 
20, 1930. 

Following the retirement of Dr. Marcus Benjamin, Paul H. Oehser 
was appointed Museum editor on April 16, by transfer from the 
Department of Agriculture. Miss Gladys O. Visel was transferred

APPENDIX 2 

REPORT ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART 

Sir : I have the honor to submit herewith my report on the opera- 
tions of the National Gallery of Art for the fiscal year ending June 
30, 1931 : 

PRESENT DISTRIBUTION OF THE ART COLLECTIONS 

In 1920 the art collections of the Institution, so far as they had 
been assigned to the care of the recently established National Gallery 
of Art, were installed in the central skylighted hall of the new 
Natural History Building of the National Museum. This hall 
extends from the rotunda on the south to the north front of the 
building, the windows of which look down on Constitution Avenue. 
Permanent screens were introduced in this hall affording excellent 
hanging space for the paintings. The disposition then made of the 
numerous groups of art works has been changed from time to time 
and important groups have been added. During the 10 years that 
have passed slight record of the placement of these collections has 
been kept, and it may be advisable to indicate here briefly the present 
distribution. 

The Harriet Lane Johnston collection, an early bequest of great 
value, comprising paintings and historical documents, is installed in 
the northwest long room of this hall. Across the hallway from 
this collection, occupying the northeast long room, is the Ralph Cross 
Johnson gift of rare European old masters, presented in 1919. 

Distributed through a number of rooms, including the large cen- 
tral gallery, are numerous groups of works by our American masters. 
Prominent among these is the great gift of 152 paintings, represent- 
ing 106 artists, by William T. Evans, of New York. The Alfred 
Duane Pell collection of art objects of varied types and much inter- 
est is accommodated in the north extension and hallway at the north 
end of the hall. A number of the larger works of both paintings and 
sculptures are installed in available spaces in the rotunda. 

On the ground and first floors are several groups of historical 
paintings. First among these is the group of World War portraits. 
Shortly after the close of the World War a number of Americans 
organized a national art committee, the purpose of which was to ob- 
tain portraits for the National Gallery of Art of a number of dis- 
tinguished leaders of the allied forces. Entering this hall from the 

43 



44 ANNUAL REPOKT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

north the visitor finds himself face to face with many of the out- 
standing personages of tlie great war — kings, queens, presidents, sol- 
diers, statesmen, and others — whose faces and achievements are fa- 
milar to the peoples of every civilized nation. 

Occupying the walls of a large room on the second floor is the 
collection of portraits of survivors of the Civil War painted from 
life by Walter Beck 50 years after the close of the war. Associated 
with this group are two other World War groups, the John Elliott 
collection of portraits of young Americans who entered the air service 
of France before the United States had decided to take part in the 
war, many of these losing their lives in the struggle; and a very 
interesting collection of sketches of prominent World War person- 
ages made by John C. Johansen for use in executing his great work, 
the " Signing of the Peace Treaty, June 28, 1919," now occupying 
the west wall of the lobby. In the lobby are assembled also numer- 
ous busts and other works of sculpture, while a number of paintings 
embellish available spaces on the walls of the stairway. The Freer 
collection, the most important single unit of the gallery's possessions, 
occuj^ies a commodious building immediately west of the Smith- 
sonian provided by the donor. The recently acquired Gellatly col- 
lection of art works of wide scope and great value is retained, as 
originally installed by the donor, in the Heckscher Building, New 
York City, due to lack of gallery space in Washington; while the 
large collection of drawings by John S. Sargent (1856-1925), a gift 
from his sisters Miss Emily Sargent and Mrs. Violet Ormond, re- 
main in storage at the Corcoran Gallery of Art for the same reason, 

THE GALLERY COMMISSION 

The tenth annual meeting of the National Gallery of Art Commis- 
sion was held in the Regents' room of the Smithsonian Institution 
at 10.30 o'clock, December 9, 1930. The members present were : Gari 
Melcliers, chairman; Frank J. Mather, jr., vice chairman; W. H. 
Holmes, secretarj'-; Herbert Adams, James E. Eraser, J. H. Gest, 
John E. Lodge, Charles Moore, E. W. Redfield, and Dr. Charles G. 
Abbot, ex officio. 

The minutes of the last annual meeting, held December 10, 1929, 
were read and approved. The annual report of the secretary of the 
commission reviewing the activities of tlie gallery for the calendar 
year 1930 was read and accepted. 

After careful inspection, a portrait of Commodore Stephen De- 
catur, by Gilbert Stuart, bequeathed to the National Gallery by the 
late William Decatur Parsons, and an enamel watch by Loulinie & 
Legandroy, Geneva, Switzerland, bequeathed to the Institution by 
Miss Charlotte Arnold H. Bryson, were accepted by the commission. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETABY 45 

THE ABNEY BEQUEST 

Doctor Abbot made the following statement: Under the will of 
Mrs. Mary Lloyd Pendleton Abney, of Ncav York, dated May 16, 
1928, the following bequest is made : 

Clause — 

Seventh. To the National Gallery, at Washiugton, D. C, heretofore known 
as the Corcoran Gallery, I give and bequeath the four Key family portraits 
said to have been painted by Peter Lilly and Godfrey Kneller, to wit, portraits 
of Mrs. John Zouch (Lady Zouch) ; Michael Arnold; Ann Arnold, wife of 
Michael Arnold and daughter of Thomas Knipe; and Susan Gardner, the 
mother of John Ross ; and I give and bequeath also the portrait of Mary 
Tayloe Lloyd, wife of my grandfather, Francis Scott Key, painted by Godfrey 
Kneller, and her miniature, painted by Robert Field ; the Key table, and two 
chairs which were used by Francis Scott Key ; the Lloyd mahogany table and 
four old chairs and old knocker from the Francis Scott Key house, which was 
at Georgetown, by the Arlington Bridge, now known as the Key Bridge. * * * 

(Note by the executrix: Mrs. Abney, while living donated and delivered to 
others the furniture mentioned in clause 7, and the " old knocker " was not 
found among her effects.) 

[Doctor Abbot, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, has been 
informed by Mrs. Jane F. Brice, the sister and executrix of Mrs. 
Abney, that the Corcoran Gallery has executed waiver to any right 
it might have to the bequest, and the matter was presented by her 
to the director of the National Gallery, with the oral request, by 
her husband, to have the National Gallery also execute a waiver of 
its rights. 

The matter was laid before the permanent committee of the Board 
of Regents. Having in mind the probable value and interest of the 
objects, both from the artistic and historical standpoints, and in 
view of the national character of the gallery, the committee did not 
feel that on the ex parte statements of the executrix, who is also 
the residuary legatee under the will, they could waive any rights 
that the gallery might have, without a proper adjudication of the 
matter, and so informed Mrs. Brice. The matter is now before the 
court.] 

THE RANGER COLLECTION 

At the request of the chairman, James E. Eraser read a report 
that had been made to the council of the National Academy regard- 
ing the selection of the Ranger pictures to be retained by the 
National Gallery. 

After full discussion in which it developed that the commission 
was not to be asked to take any official action, Mr. Gest submitted 
the following resolution, which was adopted : 

Resolved, That the thanks of the commission be tendered Mr. Fraser for his 
comprehensive statement and that the paper be included in the records of this 
meeting as a matter of informatiou. 



46 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN" INSTITUTION, 19 31 

THE WASHINGTON BICENTENNIAL CELEBRATION 

Herbert Adams brought up the matter of the "Washington bicenten- 
nial celebration planned for 1932, saying that the Sculpture Society 
had suggested a comprehensive scheme for the exhibition of paintings 
and sculptures pertaining to Washington. The matter was discussed 
at some length, and Mr. Moore stated that the Bicentennial Commis- 
sion had this matter in hand and that the commission would probably 
address a letter to the secretary of the Institution on the subject. 

EXECTIONS 

The secretary was directed to cast a ballot for the reelection of 
Gari Melchers, chairman; Prof. F. J. Mather, jr., vice chairman; and 
William H. Holmes, secretary. 

The secretary called attention to the fact that the terms of three 
members of the commission would expire on December 14. Mr. 
Fraser submitted the following resolution which was adopted : 

Resolved, That the commission recommend to the Board of Regents the 
reelection for the succeeding term of four years of the following members : 
Herbert Adams, Gari Melchers, and Charles Moore. 

There being no further business to come before the meeting, the 
commission adjourned at 12 o'clock. 

EXHIBITIONS HELD IN THE GALLERY 

1. A collection of 78 masterly water colors of Asiatic, European, 
and American Indian subjects, by William Spencer Bagdatopoulos, 
the Greek-English artist, was shown in the two northern small rooms 
of the gallery October 30 to December 22, 1930. A catalogue was 
supplied by the gallery. 

2. A memorial exhibition of water colors of Egyptian, Greek, 
French, Italian, and English subjects, by Henry Bacon, was installed 
in the large middle room of the gallery March 14 to April 30, 1931. 
The collection proved of exceptional interest. A catalogue was sup- 
plied by the gallery. 

3. The fortieth annual exhibition of the Society of Washington 
Artists, the second held in the gallery, occupied the walls in the 
central group of rooms, main floor of the gallery, February 1 to 
March 1, 1931. The exhibition included 162 paintings and 21 works 
of sculpture and received flattering public attention. An illustrated 
catalogue was supplied by the society. 

THE GALLERY CATALOGUE 

Two catalogues of the art collections of the Institution have been 
published as Bulletin 70 of the United States Xational Museum, the 
first edition in 1906 and the second in 1916, by Richard Eathbun, 



KEPOET OF THE SECRETAEY 47 

assistant secretary of the Institution, and two catalogues of the Na- 
tional Gallery of Art, the first edition in 1922 and the second in 1926, 
by the director. 

During the year the director has devoted his energies largely to 
the preparation of a comprehensive catalogue of the art works of 
the Institution, giving especial attention to works of painting and 
sculpture. This catalogue does not include the wide range of minor 
art works usually included in museums of art; and since no definite 
line has yet been drawn between assignments to the gallery and those 
that properly pertain to the Museum, the limits of the catalogue 
must remain indefinite. 

The form of the catalogue has received very especial attention. 
The cards used measure 8 by 10^ inches, corresponding thus to the 
standard manuscript sheets of the Institution, Each unit or card of 
the catalogue comprises two somewhat rigid sheets, one devoted to a 
record of the source of the work and to the biography of the artist 
and the other to a picture of the work itself. Some 600 cards are 
now completed. The portrait group comprises about one-third of 
this number. These are separately assembled owing to the anticipa- 
tion that the Institution may find it possible, in the near future, to 
organize a national portrait gallery, and possibly at least to print 
separately this portion of the catalogue of the art works of the 
Institution. 

Portraits of several types are included in the catalogue approxi- 
mately as follows: 

1. Oil paintings. 

2. Water colors. 

3. Pastel and related technique. 

4. Engravings. 

5. Sculpture. 

PROFESSOR HOLMES AXD THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION 

It may not seem out of place, since the director's official life is 
nearing its close, to record here briefly his connection with the Smith- 
sonian Institution. Just 60 years ago he entered the north door of 
the Institution an entire stranger and proceeded to sketch a bril- 
liantly colored bird installed in one of the Museum cases. He was 
observed at this work, and as a result was soon engaged in drawing 
natural history specimens for the resident professors. In 1872 he 
was appointed artist to the survey of the Territories and took part 
in the survey of the Yellowstone region. In 1874 he was appointed 
assistant geologist on the survey then working in Colorado and has 
found his services continuously called for in the fields of both science 
and art. Advancing step by step and from yeai to year in both 
branches^ he finds himself to-day a member of the National Academj 



48 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

of Sciences and Director of the National Gallery of Art. His varied 
activities in these fields are recorded in upward of 50 annual reports 
made to the departments with which he served.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 53 

NECKOLOar 

The death of James Parmelee at his home in Washington, D. C, 
on April 19, 1931, is announced. Mr. Parmelee was a member of the

56 ANNUAL REPOKT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

Curatorial work within the collection has embraced specifically 
the study and recording of inscriptions and seals on recently acquired 
Chinese paintings and of Buddhist inscriptions on stone sculptures 
and votive bronze images. The work of cataloguing the near eastern 
section of manuscripts and paintings, mentioned as being under 
way in the last report, has been completed. Translation of the 
Persian texts has fixed the identity of upwards of 60 Persian minia- 
tures taken from various early manuscripts of the Shdhndmah, the 
Gulistdn of Sa'adI, and other works. In addition to translations of 
inscriptions on objects in the Freer collection others have been 
made of inscriptions on objects submitted to the curator by other 
institutions and by private persons for expert opinion as to their 
esthetic or historical value. In all, 2,312 objects and 107 photo- 
graphs of objects were submitted for examination. 

The most important changes in exhibition that have been made 
since 1923 were accomplished during the week of March 15, amount- 
ing to the opening of four new galleries and changed exhibitions in 
two others. Galleries I and II, at the right of the entrance, are 
now devoted to the display of works of art from the Near East 
and India. Included in these are early Arabic manuscripts and 
paintings, Arabic tooled leather bindings, Persian manuscripts, 
paintings and painted pottery, Indian painting and sculpture. This 
change has not only given increased space to the near eastern section 
but also has left the eastern end of the building to the exclusive 
exhibition of the arts of China. Ancient bronzes, silver, and silver- 
gilt are now displayed in Gallery XIV, ceremonial and ornamental 
jades of the Chou and Han periods in the adjoining corridor. Gal- 
lery XVIII exhibits scroll paintings and Gallery XIX pottery, por- 
celain, and panel paintings. 

The care and preservation of objects in the collection has in- 
cluded work that can be itemized as follows : 

(1) Remounted: 

2. Chinese scroll paintings. 

1 Chinese panel painting. 

2 Japanese screen paintings. 
6 Indian miniature paintings. 

(2) Repaired (i. e., reliued, remounted, or resurfaced) : 

22 paintings hy Whistler. 
2 paintings by A. H. Thayer. 
2 paintings hy T. W. Dewing. 
2 paintings by D. W. Tryon. 
2 paintings by G. Melchers. 
1 painting by J. S. Sargent. 
1 painting by A. Ryder,

THE LIBRARY 

During the year there have been added to the main library Gl 
volumes, 20 unbound periodicals, and 150 pamphlets. Twenty vol- 
umes were sent to the bindery, 10 volumes to be bound, 4 volumes 
to be repaired, 48 numbers of Kokha to be bound in 4 volumes, and 
6 numbers of T''oung Pao to be bound in 2 volumes. A list of the 
new accessions to the library accompanies this report as Appendix 
A (not printed). 

The library is in process of being catalogued under the direction 
of the librarian of the Smithsonian Institution, W. L. Corbin. This 
work was begun in November, 1929, and is not yet completed. 

REPRODUCTIONS AND PAMPHLETS 

Seven hundred and sixty-four new negatives of objects have been 
made. Of these, 329 were made for registration photographs, 435 
for special orders and 67 for study purposes. The total number of 
reproductions available either as carbon photographs or as negatives 
from which prints can be made upon request is now 3,858. Twenty- 
four additional post cards have been published, making a total num- 
ber of 96 subjects now on sale. One hundred and nineteen lantern 
slides have also been added to the collection, making a total of 1,030 
available for study and for sale. 

The total number of sales of reproductions, at cost price, is as 
follows : Photographs, 1821 ; post cards, 15,489 ; lantern slides, 12. 



58 ANNUAL. EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

Of booklets issued by the gallery, the following were sold at cost 
price : 

F. G. A. pamphlets 117 

Synopsis of History pamphlets 105 

List of American paintings 37 

Annotated outlines of study 17 

Gallery books 204

BUILDING 

The workshop has been constantly occupied with the making of 
necessary equipment, as well as with the work necessary to the upkeep 
of the building. Under the latter the most important item was the 
renewal of the attic shade system with new and better operating 
parts and a complete set of new curtains. A new device for holding 
the smaller paintings to be photographed, four new exhibition cases, 
two bookcases, and additional frames for the card display are among 
the items of new equipment. The report of the superintendent, 
which gives a detailed account of shopwork and of the planting in 
the court, accom|)anies this report as Appendix C (not printed), 

ATTENDANCE 

The gallery has been open every day from 9 until 4.30 o'clock with 
the exceptions of Mondays, Christmas Day, and New Year's Day. 

The total attendance for the year was 125,789 ; the total attendance 
for week days was 82,574; the total Sunday attendance 43,215. As 
before, the average Sunday attendance is much more than twice that 
of week days, 831 being the average for Sunday and 318 that for a 
week da}'. Attendance reached its height in April and August with 
totals of 23,401 and 14,950, respectively. 

The total number of visitors to the offices was 1,510. Of these, 
91 came for general information, 295 to call upon members of the 
staff, 119 to see objects in storage, 100 to submit objects for examina- 
tion, 74 to study the building and installation methods, 11 to visit 
the galleries on Mondays, 216 to study in the library, 203 to see the 
reproductions of the Washington Manuscripts, 19 to make photo- 
graphs and sketches, and 16 to make tracings, while 229 came to pur- 
chase photographs, and 137 to examine photographs of objects in the 
collection. 

Fifty-two groups, ranging from 2 to 47 persons, were given docent 
service in the exhibition galleries, and 10 classes in groups ranging 
from three to nine persons were given instruction in the study room. 

On Thursday, March 12, 1931, Dr. Rudolf Meyer Riefstahl gave an 
illustrated lecture on Islamic Painting before an audience of 163 
persons. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 59 

FIELD WORK 

A general survey of the gallery's activities in the Far East will 
be found in Mr. Bishop's confidential letters, copies of which are 
transmitted herewith (Appendix B not printed). 

As in past j^ears, we have steadfastly adhered to our fundamental 
practice of conducting our expedition with due respect both for the 
dignity of the Institution and for the sensibilities of the Chinese, 
since it is our purpose, as long as we stay in the field, to serve our 
own immediate ends only to the extent that in so doing we serve 
also the ends of future archeological research in China and help to 
establish an atmosphere of greater mutual regard and confidence 
between native and foreign scientists. The fact that under existing 
conditions, difficult at times to the point of discouragement, we should 
have been able to carry out important excavations in soutliwestern 
Shansi during the autumn and spring seasons of last year, speaks 
well, I think for our policy, our field staff, and our Chinese collab- 
orators. Mr. Bishop's detailed illustrated report on these excava- 
tions is ex]3ected shortly. 

PERSONNEL

APPENDIX 4 

KEPOKT ON THE BUEEAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY 

Sir : I have the honor to submit the following report on the field 
researches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri- 
can Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1931, conducted 
in accordance with the act of Congress approved April 19, 1930. 
The act referred to contains the following item : 

American ethnology : For continuing etlinological researches among the Amer- 
ican Indians and the natives of Hawaii, the excavation and preservation of 
archeologic remains under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, includ- 
ing necessary employees, the preparation of manuscripts, drawings, and illus- 
trations, the purchase of books and periodicals, and traveling expenses, $70,280. 

M. W. Stirling, chief, left Washington during the latter part of 
January to continue his archeological researches in Florida. On the 
way south he took the opportunity to investigate a number of archeo- 
logical sites in several of the Southern States, notably a group of 
mounds which had been reported in the vicinity of High Point, N. C, 
and two mound sites on Pine Island in the Tennessee River in 
northern Alabama. 

A few days were spent in the vicinity of Montgomery, Ala,, exam- 
ining the early historic sites being investigated there by the Alabama 
Anthropological Society. A large mound had been reported in the 
vicinity of Flomaton, Ala. ; this was visited and found to be a natural 
formation. 

Continuing down the west coast of Florida, Mr. Stirling visited 
briefly the archeological sites at Crystal River, Safety Harbor, and 
Alligator Creek. The principal work for the season was commenced 
on February 5 on Blue Hill Island south of Key Marco, one of the 
northernmost of the Ten Thousand Island Group. A large sand 
burial mound was excavated and found to be of early post-Columbian 
Calusa origin. Excavation of the mound disclosed a number of inter- 
esting structural features quite unusual in Florida sand mounds. 
Six feet above the base of the mound a clay floor was encountered 
which gave evidence of having been the base of a temple structure, 
as it was surrounded by post holes and in some instances by the 
decayed remains of the wooden uprights still in place. This struc- 
ture had evidently been destroyed and the mound subsequently 
enlarged by adding 6 feet more of sand above the original substruc- 
ture. Numerous burials were encountered both above and below the 
60 



KEPORT OF THE SECRETAEY 61 

clay floor. A few articles of European manufacture were recovered 
from the upper level of the mound. As none were recovered from 
beneath the temple floor, it is possible that the older section of the 
mound is of pre-Columbian age. Cultural material recovered was 
interesting though not abundant. This included characteristic pot- 
tery specimens, pendants and ornaments made from fossil shark 
teeth, shell dishes, cups, celts, and a few stone knives and arrowheads. 
Articles of European manufacture consisted of glass beads and iron 
axes of Spanish type. More than 250 burials were removed. 

Following the completion of this work, Mr. Stirling went to the 
island of Haiti where, in the company of H. W. Krieger, of the 
United States National Museum, he investigated archeological sites 
previously worked by Mr. Krieger in various parts of the island. 
Returning from Haiti to Florida, work was continued in the eastern 
part of the State, where a number of mounds were investigated be- 
tween Miami and Cape Canaveral. 

The most interesting discovery of the entire season consisted in 
locating two series of large geometric earthworks on the eastern 
side of the Everglades, not far from Indiantown. One of these 
groups is one of the largest and best preserved works of this type 
now existing on the North American continent. It is hoped that at 
an earl}^ date the bureau will be able to begin excavations on this 
most interesting site. At the completion of this reconnaissance, Mr. 
Stirling returned to Washington, leaving almost immediately for 
Chicago in order to attend a meeting of the National Research Coun- 
cil, the purpose of which was to organize research on the subject of 
early man in America. 

Dr. John R. S wanton, ethnologist, was engaged in field work in 
Louisiana from July 1 to August 14, 1930. It was found that Rosa 
Pierrette, the sole Indian acquainted with the Ofo language and 
the one from whom, in 1908, he obtained the only specimens of that 
language in existence, was dead, and the language therefore is dead 
also. A search was made for speakers of Atakapa, but all appeared 
to be gone except one old woman who could barely recall a few 
words. The Chitimacha Indians of Charenton were visited and a 
small amount of linguistic material was obtained from them. Of the 
Tunica at Marksville, only two or three are still able to use the old 
tongue, but one of these proved to be an ideal informant and Doctor 
Swanton obtained from him a number of short stories and one long 
story in native text. The rest of the time was spent at Kinder, where 
a considerable body of material in Koasati was obtained. 

In view of the extinction of Atakapa as a spoken language, Doctor 
Swanton considered that the words, phrases, and texts collected by 
Dr. A. S. Gatschet in 188G, which comprise by far the greater portion 



62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

of the material in that tongue still preserved, should be published 
without delay and the greater part of the winter of 1930-31 was 
spent in editing it. To Gatschet's material have been added the 
Eastern Atakapa words collected by Murray and the Akokisa vocab- 
ulary obtained by the French captain, Berenger, and published by 
Du Terrage and Rivet. A bulletin containing all this is now in the 
hands of the printer. 

Work has progressed on the tribal map of North America which 
is being copied by Mrs. E. C. M. Payne, and additions have been 
made to the text to accompany it. 

Doctor Swanton is preparing the first draft of a Handbook of the 
Indians of the Southeast. 

The closing weeks of the year were devoted to reading the proof of 
Bulletin 103, entitled " Source Material for the Social and Cere- 
monial Life of the Choctaw Indians." 

Dr. Truman Michelson, ethnologist, was at work among the Kicka- 
poo of Oklahoma at the beginning of the fiscal year. A really 
representative body of Kickapoo mythology is now available, and 
it is quite certain that it is more northern than Fox mythology. 
The ritualistic origin myths are still terra incognita. A good begin- 
ning has been made on Kickapoo social organization. In the middle 
of July Doctor Michelson went among the Foxes of Iowa. The 
object of the trip vv^as to restore one Fox test phonetically and to 
obtain some new texts, in the current sjdlabic script, on Fox cere- 
monials, in both of which projects he was successful. Doctor 
Michelson returned to Washington August 4. He completed his 
memoir on the Fox WapAnowiweni and transmitted it for publica- 
tion February T. His paper. Contributions to Fox Ethnology, II, 
Bulletin 95 of the bureau, appeared in the course of the fiscal year. 

The remainder of the time was largely taken up studying materials 
gathered previously and also in extracting from Fetter's Cheyenne 
Dictionary such stems and words as can be rigorously proved to be 
Algonquian. The material on the physical anthropology of the 
Cheyenne showed clearly the great variation that occurs among liv- 
ing races. A proper technique was worked out for determining the 
Cheyenne words of Algonquian origin. Though Fetter's alphabet 
is inadequate, it was possible to partially control this material by 
comparing it with that of Doctor Michelson. Approximately TOO 
of such words and stems were extracted. Though the technique 
mentioned above is very slow. Doctor Michelson is convinced that it 
is the correct procedure. It was entirely feasible to establish about 
TO phonetic shifts which have transformed Cheyenne from normal 
Algonquian into divergent Algonquian. 

Toward the close of May Doctor Michelson left for Oklahoma and 
i-enewed his work with the Cheyenne of that State. He restored 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 63 

phonetically the material extracted from Fetter, with the result that 
it is now possible to formulate the transforming phonetic shifts with 
greater nicety. He also measured a number of Cheyenne. Though 
the number is not yet large enough to be absolutely decisive in a 
statistical sense, there is good reason to believe that the vault of 
their skulls is low, thus resembling the Dakota Sioux rather than 
most Algonquian tribes. Some new data on Cheyenne social life 
and mythology were obtained. It was his privilege to consult with 
some other anthropologists in Oklahoma and to visit one museum. 

John P. Harrington, ethnologist, was engaged during the summer 
of 1930 in the preparation of his report on the Indians who were 
brought together at San Juan Bautista Mission in the first half of 
the nineteenth century b}^ the Spanish-speaking padres from various 
parts of San Benito County, Calif., and the adjacent region. A valu- 
able vocabulary of the language, recorded by Father Felipe Arroyo 
de la Cuesta, had already been published by the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution in the sixties of the last century, but aside from this vocabu- 
lary there was little or nothing in print on these Indians. Elaborat- 
ing a wealth of material obtained from Mrs. Asccncion Solorsano, 
the last San Juan Indian who spoke the language, who died in 
January, 1930, Mr. Flarrington prepared a report on all phases of 
the life of these Indians, as far as reconstructable. This report tells 
of the remarkable way in which the language and partial ethnog- 
raphy were rescued from this sole survivor, and then proceeds to 
the history, geography, and customs of the tribe, including all that 
could be learned of former religion, ceremony, and mythology. 

Mrs. Solorsano was an Indian herb doctor, and a feature of the 
work during the summer of 1929 had been to obtain specimens and 
information to cover the ethnobotany of the tribe. Further speci- 
mens were obtained in the summer of 1930 by Mrs. Dionisia Mon- 
dragon and Miss Marta J. Herrera, daughter and granddaughter of 
Mrs. Solorsano, and these were all identified by C. V. Morton, of the 
National Herbarium. This section gives the treatment for curing 
some 60 different ailments wnth these herbs and by other curious 
means. It forms a nucleus for making comparative studies in 
Indian medicine. 

At the end of January, 1931, Mr. Harrington left for California 
for the purpose of continuing his studies in this region, this time 
specializing on the Esselen and Antoniano Indians in the southern 
part of Monterey County. Taking the specimens of San Juan 
Bautista plants with him and arriving in wild-flower season, a thor- 
ough collecting of plants was rewarded with a great mass of in- 
formation which further elucidated much of the San Juan plant 
material. This collecting was done in several places in southern 
Monterey County and simultaneously in San Benito County. Seeds 



64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

used for food were actually made up into the food product to get 
the primitive process, and the same method was followed in the 
study of medicines. 

Along with the plants the field of ethnozoology was thoroughly 
covered and practically all the animals known to these Indians were 
identified. Specimens were obtained, especially of birds, which 
proved to be the most difficult field for identification in the collect- 
ing of animal names, and the skins were identified by the division of 
birds of the National Museum. Eight different kinds of snakes were 
known by name and identified. 

One of the rarest features of the work was the obtaining of a 
number of old Indian place names in the old Esselen country, the 
western tributary of the Salinas River known as the Arroyo Seco. 
A study of the place names resulted in the discovery that the Esselen 
were not a coastal but an inland people, inhabiting the Arroyo Seco 
and a section of the Salinas River and centered about Soledad Mis- 
sion. They were one of the smallest tribes in California, and the 
name properly begins with an h ; they were known in the San Juan 
Bautista from all that section of California. The expedition went 
from Monterey to the Aguage de Martin and from there climbed the 
mountain. Some 40 exposures were made of the various rocks con- 
nected with the ceremonies and the springs and camps, and several 
hundred pages of notes were taken down in California Spanish 
from Don Angel and others dealing with the history of these cere- 
monies and the life of Mariana and Joaquin Murrieta. On the way 
back to the coast the Cruz Cervantes ranch was visited, where Mur- 
rietta and Mariana were equipped by Don Cruz for starting their 
war against the Americans. 

An examination of place names and village sites and linguistic 
studies occupied Mr. Harrington up to the end of June. Not only 
were vocabularies of early recording utilized but the invaluable rec- 
ords contained in the old mission books were, through the courtesy of 
Bishop McGinley, of Fresno, placed at the disposal of the Smith- 
sonian Institution for copying, and a considerable part of these 
books has already been copied and revised with the aid of the oldest 
Indians. 

Dr. F. H. H. Roberts, jr., archeologist, devoted the fiscal year to a 
number of activities. During the months of July, August, and Sep- 
tember, excavations at a site on the Zufii reservation, 16 miles north- 
east of the Indian village of Zufii, were brought to a conclusion. 
The work had been started the latter part of May, 1930. At the 
end of the season's field work the ruins of two houses, one containing 
64 rooms, the other 20 rooms, and a number of ceremonial chambers 



EEPOET OF THE SECRETARY 65 

had been cleared of the debris which had accumulated in them in 
the centuries which have passed since their abandonment. 

Evidence showed that the largest of the houses had not been 
erected as a complete unit and that it was not occupied in its en- 
tirety at any time. The central block, together with a supercere- 
monial chamber placed at its southern side, constituted the original 
block of the structure. Subsequent additions consisted of an east- 
and-west wing and a series of chambers south of the original portion 
and east of the great ceremonial chamber. Masonry in the walls of 
the latter portions was inferior to that in the original section. The 
outlines of the rooms in these same portions of the building were so 
irregular that they appeared to have been built by a different group 
of people. The walls in the original section were constructed in a 
style characteristic of the ruins in the Chaco Canyon, 85 miles north- 
east from the Zuni region. The stonework in the latter portions of 
the building was suggestive of the type found in the ruins of the 
Upper Gila area to the south. 

The small house did not give evidence of growth stages as distinct 
as those observed in the large building ; it did show, however, that a 
fairly small structure had been added to on various occasions. The 
walls in this building were of the same nature as those in the later 
portions of the larger dwelling, except that the stones were more 
carefully dressed. This suggested that the small house may have 
been built by the same group which erected the later portions of the 
large one. 

In addition to the two houses and seven small ceremonial chambers 
two great kivas were found. Only one of these was excavated. In 
the case of the other it was possible merely to trace the outer walls 
in order to obtain the size and position of the structure. The find- 
ing of these two great kivas was significant because investigations in 
the Southwest have shown that such structures are always associated 
with some form of the Chaco culture. The great kiva connected 
with the larger of the two dwellings revealed one of the essential 
characteristics of such structures when the debris which filled it was 
removed. It had an average diameter of 55 feet. The second of 
these large circular houses was completely detached from the other 
buildings in the village and had been placed in a court formed by 
the other structures. It averaged 78 feet in diameter, which makes 
it the largest yet discovered. 

The excavations yielded 400 specimens of the people's handicraft 
in addition to the information on house types. Included in the 
collection are pottery vessels, tools or implements of stone and bone, 
ornaments, and a number of stone images. The pottery is character- 
ized by examples typical of the Chaco Canyon wares and also speci-

mens characteristic of the Upper Gila region to the south. The 
summer's investigations demonstrate that the village on the Zuni 
Reservation belongs to the great period of the prehistoric pueblos, 
that designated as Pueblo III in southwestern chronology. The 
evidence obtained also indicates that there was a fusion of two groups 
of people at this location: One, the first to arrive, came from the 
Chaco area in the north, and the other from the Upper Gila villages 
in the south. Charred timbers obtained from the ruins enabled Dr. 
A. E. Douglass, of the University of Arizona, to give the dates 
1000 to 1030 A. D. for the life of the community. 

Upon the completion of the above work one week was spent in 
making an archeological survey on the Zuni reservation and in the 
region west and northwest from that district. As a result of the 
reconnaissance, a promising site for further investigations was 
found. Following this, a trip was made to Cortez, Colo., for the 
purpose of inspecting ruins being excavated by Lee Dawson near 
the opening into McElmo Canyon, 4 miles southwest from Cortez, 
It was found that Mr. Dawson had an unusually interesting group 
of unit-type houses on his property. Of particular interest were the 
kivas or ceremonial chambers associated with these structures. In 
many of them the walls had been ornamented with a series of paint- 
ings placed in bands encircling the walls. From Cortez the writer 
went to Denver and from there returned to Washington the middle 
of October. 

During the winter months, galley, page, and final proofs were read 
on Bulletin 100, a report on work conducted during the summer of 
1929, entitled ".The Ruins of Kiatuthlanna, Eastern Arizona." In 
addition, the specimens brought in from the summer field work were 
studied. Drawings and photographs were made of them for use in 
a report on the work. Six hundred pages of manuscript, entitled 
"The Village of the Great Kivas on the Zuni Reservation, New 
Mexico." was prepared. Thirty text figures were drawn to accom- 
pany this manuscript. 

Doctor Roberts left Washington May 14, 1931, for Denver, Cole, 
for the purpose of inspecting and studying the specimens obtained 
by the Smithsonian Institution-University of Denver Cooperative 
Expedition in the summer of 1930 and also for the purpose of 
examining collections in the Colorado State Museum. He left Denver 
on May 25 for Santa Fe, N. Mex. At the latter place two days were 
spent in studying the collections at the Laboratory of Anthropology 
and at the Museum of New Mexico. From Santa Fe he proceeded 
to Gallup, N. Mex., where supplies were obtained for a field camp. 
From Gallup this material was taken to a site 31/4. miles south of 
Allantown, Ariz., where a camp was established and excavations

started on the remains of a lar<^^e pit-house village. One refuse 
mound containing 12 burials with accompanying mortuary offer- 
ings and two pit houses had been investigated at the close of the 
fiscal year. 

The pit houses were found to be characteristic of that type and 
quite comparable to those excavated in the Chaco Canyon in 1927, 
reported in Bulletin 92 of the Bureau of American Ethnology, and 
to those excavated in eastern Arizona in the summer of 1929, 
described in Bulletin 100 of the bureau. 

From July 1, 1930, to May 10, 1931, J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist, 
was engaged in routine office work, and from the latter date to the 
end of the fiscal year he was engaged in field service on the Grant 
of the Six Nations on the Grand River in Ontario, Canada, and, 
briefly, on the Tuscarora reservation in western New York State. 

Mr. Hewitt devoted much time and study to rearranging and 
retyping some of his native Iroquoian texts which critical revisions 
and additional data had made necessary to facilitate interlinear 
translations and to render such texts as legible as possible for the 
printer. 

The texts so treated are the Cayuga version of the founding of the 
League of the Iroquois as dictated by the late Chief Abram Charles ; 
the version of the Eulogy of the Founders as dictated by Chief Jacob 
Hess in Cayuga, and also his versions of the addresses introducing 
the several chants; also, four of the myths of the Wind and Vege- 
table Gods which are usually represented by wooden faces and husk 
faces (which are customarily misnamed masks, although their chief 
purpose is to represent, not to mask). The Onondaga texts of these 
myths were in great need of careful revision, for their relator was 
extremely careless in his use of the persons and the tenses of the 
verbs, frequently changing from the third to the second person and 
from past to future time by unconsciously employing the language 
of the rites peculiar to the faces ; and also the decipherment of a set 
of i:)ictographs or mnemonic figures, designed and employed by the 
late Chief Abram Charles, of the Grand River Reservation in 
Canada, to recall to his mind the official names and their order of 
the 49 federal chiefs of the Council of the League of the Iroquois, 
in chanting the Eulogy of the Founders of the League; and also to 
recall the 15 sections or burdens of the great Requickening Address 
of the Council of Condolence and Installation ; this paper with illus- 
trations is nearly ready for the printer; and also a critical study of 
the matter of the Onondaga and the Cayuga texts, giving the several 
variant versions of the events attending the birth and childhood and 
work of Deganawida. He was born of a virgin mother, which indi- 
cated that underlying them there appeared to be an ideal figure, 
102992—32 6 



68 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAlsr INSTITUTIOlsr, 19 31 

although of course unexpressed. This discovery showed the need for 
thorough search in the field for a living tradition in which this ideal 
is fully expressed. Further search was deferred to field work. It 
was clear that such an ideal enhanced the beauty of the birth story 
of Deganawida and made more interesting the historicity of such a 
person. Mr. Hewitt had the great satisfaction of recovering such a 
tradition in his subsequent field researches. He found that the in- 
feriority complex had precluded his present informants from ex- 
pressing themselves during the lifetime of other informants, whose 
recent deaths opened their mouths without the fear of contradic- 
tion. The death of Abram Charles within the year made these shy 
informants vocal. 

In January Matthew W. Stirling, chief of the Bureau of American 
Ethnology, requested Mr. Hewitt to undertake the editing of the 
Manuscript Journal of Rudolph Friederich Kurz, of Berne, Switzer- 
land, in the manner in which he had prepared the Edwin Thompson 
Denig Report on the Indian Tribes of the Upper Missouri River, 
published in the Forty-sixth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ameri- 
can Ethnology. The Kurz manuscript was written in German dur- 
ing the years 1846 to 1852. The typed German text consists of 454 
pages of large legal cap size, while the English translation of it by 
Myrtis Jarrell occupies 780 pages. The journal is a narrative of 
Mr. Kurz's experiences in a trip up the Mississippi River from New 
Orleans to St. Louis, thence up the Missouri to Fort Union at the 
Mouth of the Yellowstone River, and of his difficulties with the 
Indians while endeavoring to make drawings or pictures of them. 
There are 125 pen sketches of Indians and others accompanying the 
manuscript. 

Mr. Hewitt represents the Bureau of American Ethnology, Smith- 
sonian Institution, on the United States Geographic Board, and 
is a member of its executive committee. In connection with the 
forthcoming issue of the sixth report of this board much extra work 
had to be done by members of the executive committee. Mr. Hewitt 
prepared a memorandum for a portion of the introduction. Mr. 
Hewitt also devoted much time and study to the collection and 
preparation of data for official replies to correspondents of the 
bureau, some demanding long research. Miss Mae W. Tucker has 
assisted Mr. Hewitt in the care of the manuscript and phonograph 
and photograph records of the archives. 

On May 10, 1931, Mr. Hewitt left Washington, D. C, on field 
duty and returned to tlie bureau July 2, 1931. During this trip he 
visited the Grand River grant of the Six Nations of Iroquois Indians 
dwelling near Brantford, Canada, and also the Tuscarora Reserva- 
tion near Niagara Falls, N. Y. 



EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY 69 

Winslow M. Walker was appointed to the staff of the Bureau of 
American Ethnolon^y as associate anthropologist in March, 1931. He 
resumed his research in Hawaiian archeology, begun during a year's 
stay in the Hawaiian Islands in 1929, in preparation for a paper on 
Hawaiian sculpture. 

In preparation for work in the field Mr. Walker undertook re- 
search in the early narratives of exploration in Louisiana and Arkan- 
sas. He left Washington May 29 to investigate some caves in the 
vicinity of Gilbert, Ark., in the Ozark Mountains, with the hope of 
being able to throw new light on the Ozark bluff dwellers and other 
early inhabitants of the caves. Sixteen caves were explored and 
excavations were made in several of the most promising. A large 
cave at Cedar Grove yielded several skeletons and a considerable 
number of stone, flint, and bone artifacts. As the fiscal year closed 
Mr. Walker was still engaged in excavating this cavern. He intends 
to make a brief survey of certain mounds and village sites along the 
Red River Valle}^ in the northern part of Louisiana on the com- 
pletion of his work in Arkansas. 

SPECIAL RESEARCHES 

The study of Indian music for the Bureau of American Ethnology 
has been carried forward during the past year by Miss Frances Dens- 
more. The three phases of this research are (1) the recording of 
songs and collecting of other material in the field, including the pur- 
chase of specimens; (2) the transcription and analysis of songs, with 
the development of information; and (3) the preparation of material 
for publication. All these phases have received attention during 
the year, and the songs of three hitherto unstudied localities have 
been recorded. 

Early in July, 1930, Miss Densmore went to Grand Portage, an 
isolated Chippewa village on Lake Superior, near the Canadian 
boundary. This village was visited in 1905, a ceremony was wit- 
nessed, and one of its songs written down ; therefore a return to 
Grand Portage was particularly interesting. The purpose of the 
trip was to witness the Chippewa dances on the Fourth of July, but 
she remained more than three weeks, continuing her study of native 
customs. Several songs of the ivahunowhi were heard and translated, 
these resembling the songs of the Grand Medicine, which formed a 
subject of intensive study during 1907-1911. She also witnessed the 
tipi-shaking of an Indian medicine man and listened to his songs 
for almost an hour. This performance is very rare at the present 
time. Although the evening was quiet, the tipi was seen to sway as 
though buffeted by a tempest, then remain motionless a few seconds 
and again shake convulsively. This was continuous while Miss 
Densmore watched the performance and was said to have continued 



70 ANN-UAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

several hours afterwards. Inside the tipi sat the medicine man, 
believed to be talking with spirits whom he had summoned, the 
spirits making known their presence by the shaking of the conical 
structure. The next day the medicine man said that he had sum- 
moned the spirits in order to ascertain whether his treatment of a 
certain sick man would be successful. He said that if the spirits 
" spoke loud and clear " the man would recover, but if their voices 
were faint the man would die. The response was said to have been 
satisfactory, and accordingly he instituted a " beneficial dance," 
which was attended by Miss Densmore, and the songs heard for a 
considerable time. These, like the songs in the tipi, resembled the 
songs of the Chippewa Grand Medicine Society. 

The study of Indian music was continued by a trip to Kilbourn, 
Wis., during August and September. Two pageants are given simul- 
taneously at The Dalles of the Wisconsin River, near Kilbourn, each 
employing about 100 Indians. In the pageants the swan and hoop 
dance, as well as war and social dances of the Winnebago, were seen. 
The dances of other tribes presented in the pageants included the 
eagle dance and other pueblo dances. Songs of the swan, hoop, and 
frog dances were later recorded by leading pageant singers. 

At Kilbourn Miss Densmore recorded numerous songs of Pueblo 
Indians from Isleta and Cochiti, these consisting chiefly of corn- 
grinding and war songs. The words of these songs are highly poetic 
and many of the melodies resemble Acoma songs in structure. 

As John Bearskin and his family were traveling from Kilbourn to 
their home in Nebraska they passed through Red Wing, Minn., and 
songs were recorded at Miss Densmore's home. Bearskin recorded 
three complete sets of the Winnebago medicine lodge songs and a set 
of Buffalo feast songs. 

In January, 1931, Miss Densmore went to Washington, where she 
worked on the preparation of material for publication, and proceeded 
thence to Miami, Fla., where she began a study of Seminole music, 
recording songs of the corn dance from the man who leads the 
singing in that ceremony; also the songs that precede a hunting 
expedition. The customs of the Seminole were studied and a collec- 
tion of specimens was obtained. This collection includes two com- 
plete costumes and is now the property of the United States National 
Museum. 

The second phase of the research is represented by eight manu- 
scripts which include the transcriptions and analyses of 77 songs and 
two flute melodies recorded by Winnebago, Isleta, Cochiti, and Sem- 
inole Indians. The cumulative analyses of Indian songs has been 
continued and now comprises 1,553 songs. The 14 tables submitted 
during this year constitute a comparison between a large series of 
Nootka and Quileute songs and the songs previously analyzed by 
the same method. 



EEPOKT OF THE SECRETAE.T 71 

The third phase of work comprised the preparation for j)ublica- 
tion of " Menominee Music " and "Acoma Music." 

Frank M. Setzler, assistant curator, division of archeology, United 
States National Museum, was detailed to the bureau for the purpose 
of conducting an archeological investigation in Texas. After briefly 
examining several sites at Victoria and Brownsville along the Gulf 
coast, he excavated four caves and one rock shelter on the Mollie B. 
Knight ranch, in Presidio County, and visited several other caverns 
in the vicinity. 

From one large cave a total of 70 specimens, including baskets, 
matting, cradles, sandals, beads, corn, gourd shards, and one skele- 
ton, were recovered. No pottery or evidence of European influence 
was found. Although the site is only 150 miles east of a marginal 
Basket Maker culture, no local trace was found of these early south- 
western people. The material differs in some respects from any other 
in the Museum and more research will be required before it can be 
definitely identified. 

EDITORIAL WORK AND PUBLICATIONS 

The editing of the publications of the bureau was continued 
through the year by Stanley Searles, editor, assisted by Mrs. Frances 
S. Nichols, editorial assistant. The status of the publications is

DISTRIBUTION OF PUBLICATIONS 

The distribution of the publications of the bureau has been con- 
tinued under the charge of Miss Helen Munroe, assisted by Miss 
Emma B. Powers. Publications distributed were as follows : 

Report volumes and separates 6, 003 

Bulletins and separates 13, 924 

Contributions to North American Ethnology 33 

Miscellaneous publications 515 

Total 20,475 

As compared with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1930, there was 
a decrease of 4,393, This decrease is mainly in the distribution of 
bulletins and separates, and possibly is largely explained by the very 
large number of separates from the handbook which were sent in the 
previous year to the many groups of Camp Fire Girls. No great 
demand from any one group was received in this past fiscal year. 

Twenty-eight addresses were added to the mailing list during the 
year and 20 were taken off. The mailing list now stands at 1,635, in 
addition to the members of the staff of the bureau and other branches 
of the Institution who receive the publications regularly as issued.

EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY 73 

During the early part of the calendar year Miss Mae W. Tucker 
was detailed to this branch to assist in listing and cataloguing the 
great collection of Indian negatives already classified by Mr. Gill 
in previous years. Of the purely ethnologic subjects, including por- 
traits, arts, and industries, the list will embrace more than 7,000 
units. This work, so long delayed, has progressed most satisfactorily. 

LIBRARY 

The reference library has continued under the care of Miss Ella 
Leary, librarian, assisted by Thomas Blackwell. 

During the year 600 volumes were accessioned, of which 97 were 
acquired by purchase, 100 by binding of periodicals, and 403 by gift 
and exchange ; also 190 pamphlets and 3,500 serials, chiefly the pub- 
lications of learned societies, were received and recorded, of which 
28 were obtained by purchase, the remainder being received through 
exchange, giving us at the close of the year a working library of 
26,671 volumes, 16,717 pamphlets, and several thousand unbound 
periodicals. Books loaned during the year numbered 975 volumes. 
During the year 473 volumes were bound. In addition to the use of 
its own library, which is becoming more valuable through exchange 
and by limited purchase, it was found necessary to draw on the 
Library of Congress for the loan of about 250 volumes, and in turn 
the bureau library was frequently consulted by officers of other 
Government establishments, as well as by students not connected 
with the Smithsonian Institution. The purchase of books and peri- 
odicals has been restricted to such as relate to the bureau's researches. 
During the year the cataloguing has been carried on as new acces- 
sions were acquired and good progress was made in cataloguing 
ethnologic and related articles in the earlier serials. The catalogue 
was increased by the addition of 3,500 cards. A considerable amount 
of reference work was done in the usual course of the library's 
service to investigators and students, both in the Smithsonian 
Institution and outside.

MISCELLANEOUS 

The correspondence and other clerical work of the office has been 
conducted by Miss May S. Clark, clerk to the chief, assisted by 
Anthony W. Wilding, clerk. Miss Mae W. Tucker, stenographer, 
was engaged in copying manuscript material for Doctor Swanton 
and in assisting Mr. Hewitt in his work as custodian of manuscripts 
and phonograph records. The manuscript Dictionary of * * * 
Indian Languages of North, Central, and South America and the 
West Indies, compiled by W. R. Gerard, which was in danger of 
becoming illegible due to the frayed condition of the paper on which 
it was written and the faded writing, has been copied by Miss Tucker. 
Work was begun on the catalogue of the photographic negatives 
belonging to the bureau. To date approximately 7,000 negatives 
have been listed. 

During the course of the year information was furnished by 
members of the staff in reply to numerous inquiries concerning the 
North American Indians, both past and present, and the Mexican 
peoples of the prehistoric and early historic periods to the south. 
Various specimens sent to the bureau were identified and data on 
them furnished for their owners.

APPENDIX 5 

KEPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE 

SERVICE 

Sir : I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera- 
tions of the International Exchange Service during the fiscal year 
ending June 30, 1931 : 

The appropriation granted by Congress for the support of the 
system of international exchanges during the year was $r)2,810, an 
increase of $1,513 over the amount allowed for the preceding year. 
Of this increase, $1,000 was for freight, $160 to cover the additional 
sum required to meet the provisions of the Brookhart Act amending 
section 13 of the classification act of 1923, and $353 to advance to 
the next step in their respective grades those of the employees of 
the exchange ofiice eligible for promotion. The repayments from 
departmental and other establishments aggregated $5,000.57, making 
the total available resources for conducting the service during 1931 
$57,810.57. 

The total number of packages handled w^as 611,338, a decrease 
from the previous year of 53,327 (7.7 per cent). The weight of 
these packages was 612,190 pounds, a falling off of 65,901 pounds 
(9.3 per cent). These decreases no doubt were due to the world-wide 
depression. However, the economic condition affected the output of 
literature more abroad than in the United States, as will be noted 
when it is stated that the number of packages sent through the Inter- 
national Exchange Service decreased only 6 per cent, while those 
received from abroad decreased nearly 22 per cent. 

The publications passing through the service are classified as par- 
liamentary documents, departmental documents, and miscellaneous 
scientific and literary publications. The number and weight of the 
packages containing the publications coming under these different 
headings are as follows:

During the year 3,002 boxes were shipped abroad, a decrease from 
the number for the preceding 12 montlis of 233, a little over 7 per 
cent. Of the total number of boxes, 692 contained full sets of United 
States official documents for authorized depositories abroad, and the 
remainder (2,310) were filled with publications for miscellaneous 
correspondents. The boxes measured 16,003 cubic feet.

As explained in previous reports, in addition to the packages for- 
warded abroad in boxes for distribution by foreign exchange bureaus, 
man}^ are transmitted direct to their destinations by mail — some be- 
cause it is more economical to send by mail than by freight; some, 
like the daily issue of the Congressional Kecord, because treaty 
stipulations provide that they shall be so forwarded; and some for 
the reason that they are for places remote from existing exchange 
agencies. The total number of packages transmitted by mail during 
the year was 76,609, an increase over last year of 8,664. 

Last year mention was made that nine boxes of exchanges from 
Germany were destroyed at the steamship pier in New York through 
the burning and sinking of the vessel on board of which the boxes 
were being transmitted to this country. I regret to report that during 
the current fiscal year eight bo.xes for China met a similar fate at 
the pier in New York, the steamship President Harrison^ on board

of which the consignment had been phiced for transmission to China, 
Iiaving been destroyed by fire and water. 

As usual, assistance was rendered during the year to the Library 
of Congress in procuring for its division of documents copies of 
various foreign governmental publications missing in its collections. 
Aid also was given to a number of establishments, both here and 
abroad, in obtaining specially desired publications. For this service, 
as well as for the help in the distribution of exchanges, letters of 
appreciation are often, received by the Institution from its corre- 
spondents. 

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS 

There are now forwarded to foreign depositories of United States 
official documents 112 sets — 62 full and 50 partial — an increase of 
three over the number transmitted last year. Afghanistan, Bengal, 
and the Vatican Library were added to the list of those countries 
receiving partial sets. Greece, to which the shipment of a full set 
was temporarily suspended, has been listed to receive a partial set. 
The partial set sent to Alsace-Lorraine has been discontinued. 

The address to which the partial set for Guatemala was forwarded 
has been changed from the Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores to the 
Biblioteca Nacional. The depository in Poland to which a full set 
of Government documents is forwarded has been changed by the 
Polish Government from the Library of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs to the National Library in Warsaw. 

A complete list of the depositories is given below :

APPENDIX 6 
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK 

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera- 
tions of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending 
June 30, 1931 : 

The regular appropriation made by Congress for the maintenance 
of the park was $220,520, an increase of $17,520 over 1930. In order 
that plans and specifications might be prepared for a small mammal 
house before the convening of the next Congress, $4,500 was appro- 
priated and made immediately available for this purpose. In addition 
an appropriation of $10,000 was provided in the second deficiency act 
for new boilers and conduits. The regular appropriation act also 
reappropriated $9,703 remaining unexpended under the bird-house 
appropriation of 1928 for grading and the construction of cages 
adjacent to the bird house. In the 1932 appropriation act $4,500 was 
also made available immediately upon approval of that act to provide 
for care of the Evans collec<-^on. Thus a total of $255,223 was avail- 
able during the fiscal year. The regular appropriation, together with 
the additions, has made it possible to carry out some greatly needed 
repairs and improvements, and the work of the park has jDrogressed 
in a very satisfactory manner. 

ACCESSIONS 

Gifts. — The outstanding gift of the year was the Victor J. Evans 
collection of 133 species and 244 individuals, which was bequeathed to 
the United States Government for the National Zoological Park by 
the late Victor J. Evans. 

Mr. Evans for years had been deeply interested in animal life and 
had formed an unusually fine collection of rarities in his private zoo. 
These are listed among the donations and include two specimens of 
the white-crowned guenon {C erco'pithecus petronellae) ., an exceed- 
ingly rare little monkey, regarding which practically nothing is 
known. 

Mr. Evans had previously donated many rare species to the Zoo, 
among them the glacier bear, almost unique in captivity. 

The reptile house created a great deal of interest throughout 
America, and a steady stream of gifts for the exhibition has been 
comine in ever since the house has been open. 
86 



EEPORT OF THE SECRETARY 87 

Foster H. Benjamin, engaged in field work in Florida for the 
United States Department of Agriculture, has sent in many fine 
specimens; and we have profited very much through the field trips 
of Dr. Charles E. Burt, of Waxahachie, Tex., who has sent us the 
specimens picked up that he thought would be interesting to the 
Park. Dewey Moore, of Indio, Calif., has been on the alert and has 
sent a number of valuable specimens that we could not otherwise have 
obtained. 

William K. Eyan, of Washington, D. C, a fancier of rare birds, 
has presented several especially desirable species. 

The San Diego Zoo, of San Diego, Calif., contributed a collection 
of some of the California species of reptiles that are difficult to 
obtain. 

In the late fall the director, on his vacation, visited Central 
America, and while at Tela, Honduras, he was presented such 
species as seemed desirable from the famous Tela Serpentarium. 
R. E. Stadelman, in charge of the laboratory, accompanied him on 
field collecting trips. The United Fruit Co. greatly facilitated the 
work, and thanks are due to R. K. Thomas and Dr. R. P. MacPhail 
for kindly hospitality and much aid. Incidentally the director col- 
lected various small species and through the aid of the honorable 
Secretary of Agriculture of Cuba and the chief of the Oficina Sani- 
dad Vegetal, Ernesto Sanchez Estrada, was enabled to bring home 
a flock of 20 Cuban flamingoes. The entire collection obtained on this 
trip was transported by the United Fruit Co. free of charge to New 
York, and every possible facility for the proper care of the specimens 
was afforded. This was most valuable assistance, which enabled 
the successful landing of specimens that might not otherwise have 
been procurable. 

The United States Biological Survey of the Department of Agri- 
culture and numerous members of its staff have contributed speci- 
mens to the Zoo and have assisted iti making arrangements for other 
parties to supply us with specimens. 

Dr. Alexander Wetmore and Frederick C. Lincoln on a trip to 
Haiti obtained and presented several specimens of two species of 
lizards not seen before in captivity. 

An outstanding gift Vv^as that of three beautiful specimens of 
Kodiak bear cubs collected and presented by Senator Frederick 
Hale, of Maine. He caught these and brought them personally to 
Washington, where they are now thriving. As the National Zoologi- 
cal Park endeavors to maintain an especially good collection of 
Alaskan bears these cubs are a highly appreciated addition. 

Practically all the plants placed in the reptile house as setting for 
animals were gifts from various branches of the United States Gov- 
ernment and private individuals. The larger contributors were: 



88 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

Bureau of Plant Industry of the Department of Agriculture, the 
Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks, the United States 
Botanic Garden. Walter Eeed Hospital, and San Diego Zoo. 

ENDOWMENTS 

The first endowments ever received by the Zoo were two given 
during the fiscal year 1931. The Frances Brinckle Zerbee Memorial 
Fund of $1,000 was given to the Smithsonian Institution b}'^ Maj. 
Leigh Zerbee, her husband, for the use of the National Zoological 
Park to maintain stock in aquariums. Mrs. Zerbee was particularly 
interested in fishes and other small aquatic forms and it was in recog- 
nition of her keen interest in such matters that Major Zerbee estab- 
lished this memorial fund. A bronze tablet has been placed in thc^ 
reptile house over the aquaria in which this stock is to be maintained. 

William S. Barstow of Great Neck, Long Island, presented $1,000 
as an endowment in the name of his son, Frederic D. Barstow. 
This money has been invested and the income from it will be 
used to keep a cage in the zoo stocked with some interesting small 
mammal. Frederic D. Barstow, who died soon after this fund 
was established, was a keen enthusiast regarding birds and mammals 
and had made several trips to the Tropics for the purpose of 
collecting them. 

The only previous contribution to the Zoo at all similar in charac- 
ter was the construction of the Beatrice Henderson cage for birds. 
This cage was built during the summer of 1912 by the late John B. 
Henderson, jr. It is about 24 by 40 by 26 feet, situated near the 
great flight cage, and now houses cockatoos of various kinds.

Many species of reptiles deposited eggs since being moved into 
their new quarters in the reptile house, and a few hatched after 
June 30, but there were no natural increases in the stock during the 
year. 

Early Easter morning an African python laid about two dozen 
eggs and incubated them for a period of two months. Unfortunately, 
however, they proved to be infertile. This was of considerable 
scientific as well as popular interest. 

Purchases and exchanges. — The principal purchases this year have 
been a male black African rhinoceros, a specimen of the rare babi- 
russa, a pair of raccoon dogs, a Bornean gray gibbon, a Siamang 
gibbon, and a white-handed gibbon. The last three were purchased 
under the Walter P. Chrysler fund. At the time these animals were 
acquired the Zoo had a pair of white-cheeked gibbons and their 
young, which gave us a total of 4 species of gibbons on exhibition at 
one time. 



EEPORT OP THE SECRETARY 95 

The rhinoceros has apparently adapted himself to our conditions 
and has made a splendid growth. 

A quantity of reptiles were purchased for the opening of the new 
building. Chief among these is a magnificent king cobra, measuring 
14 feet 6 inches in length. This was secured six months before we 
had quarters for it, but Dr. Raymond L. Ditmars, of the New York 
Zoological Park, very kindly took care of it during this time and 
then brought it down personally. 

A number of small exchanges have been made, but the most inter- 
esting was that of a polar bear which was received from the Zoologi- 
cal Park of Edinburgh. This is a male which has been placed with 
Marian, a young female of the same species. 

REMOVALS 

Causes of death. — When it has been thought that determination of 
the cause of death of certain animals might be useful, the specimens 
have been submitted to the pathological division of the Bureau of 
Animal Industry for examination. The following list shows the 
results of the autopsies: 

MAMMALS 

Artiodactyla : Obstruction in the oesopliagus, 1 ; odema of the heart and peri- 
cardium, 1 : chronic pneumonia, 1 ; liver spotted with tubercules, indications 
of tuberculosis, 1. 

Carnivora : Gastroenteritis, 1 ; multiple body abscesses, 1 ; enteritis, 1. 

Primates : Gastritis and ulcerated pyloric knob, 1. 

BIBOS

VISITORS 

The great number of visitors who have been coming to the park 
since the opening of the reptile house has prevented sucli a decline 
in the year's attendance as exists in other institutions of public 
interest because of the economic depression which has so reduced 
travel. The estimated attendance as recorded in the daily reports 
of the park is as follows : 



1930 

July 186,600

IMPROVEMENTS 

The most interesting event of recent years has been the opening of 
the public exhibition building for reptiles, amphibians, insects, and 
miscellaneous invertebrates. The construction of this building was 
started in March, 1930, and the exhibition was formally opened the 
evening of February 27, 1931. Some 3,000 people attended the re- 
ception, and the following day the building was crowded from morn- 
ing to night. The formal opening was attended by a large number 
of officials of the United States Govermnent and officials of other 
zoos who were particularly interested in the building. Among the 
latter were Dr. W. Eeid Blair, director of the New York Zoological 
Park; C. Emerson Brown, director of the Philadelphia Zoological 
Garden; George P. Vierheller, director of the St. Louis Zoological 
Garden; Dan Harkins, director of Franklin Park Zoo, Boston; and 
Dr. Raymond L. Ditmars, curator of reptiles, New York Zoological 
Park. 

Since its opening it has been by far the most popular and crowded 
building in the entire Zoo. Natural habitat for the reptiles has 
been provided as far as possible. There is a special ventilating sys- 
102902—32 9 



116 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

tem for the public and a special heating system for the reptiles. 
Light is all from above so that the visibility is far superior to any- 
thing vre have ever had before. This building, containing over a 
hundred cages, fills a long felt need in the Zoo. 

"With a view to helping house the Victor J. Evans collection, Con- 
gress added $4,500 to the appropriation, and with this money we 
have built a series of large mammal paddocks with sheds, runs for 
cranes, and large outdoor cages for pheasants. 

Out of money unexpended from a previous year and reappropri- 
ated for this Fiscal year is being built a flight cage for the eagles, to 
replace the one that had to be torn down to clear the site for the 
reptile house. Other cages will be constructed near by, so that all 
of the birds will be grouped in the general vicinity of the bird house. 

Contracts have been let for new boilers at the central heating 
plant, to replace two secondhand ones that had been installed 29 
years ago. The main steam line from the central heating plant to the 
buildings began to give way during the early fall, and certain of the 
steam lines supplying individual buildings began to develop leaks, 
which indicated that they could no longer be successfully repaired. 
This matter was presented to Congress, with the result that sufficient 
money was provided to renew the lines that showed most imminent 
danger of giving out. The new pipes are planned to be a portion of 
an extensive central conduit system when finally completed. 

A quantity of earth from near-by excavations was made available 
to the park without cost, and, by carefully planning the dumping 
of this, three considerable level areas were developed on which we 
are now able to place outside paddocks, runs, and cages. 

NEEDS or THE ZOO 

Since completion of the reptile house, the next building on our 
program, the small mammal and great ape house, becomes the one 
most urgently needed at the present time. We have no suitable quar- 
ters at all for these groups of animals, both of which are represented 
in the collection by continually increasing numbers of interesting 
species. Plans and specifications for this building are now being 
prepared under the appropriation of $4,500 made available by the 
last Congress for this purpose. 

Following this, the next exhibition building needed is one for 
the pachyderms. A room to complete the bird house is also needed. 

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 7 

EEPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY 

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi- 
ties of the xVstrophysical Observatory for the fiscal year ended June 
30, 1931 : 

PLANT AND (, EJECTS 

This observatory operates regularly the centrni station at Wash- 
ington and two field stations for observing solar radiation on Table 
Mountain, Calif., and Mount Montezuma, Chile. The station at 
Mount Brukkaros, Southwest Africa, which was establislied b}'- the 
National Geographic Society, is being continued for the present in 
cooperation with the Astrophysical Observatory with funds donated 
by a friend of the Institution. In addition the observatory controls 
a station on Mount Wilson, Calif., where occasional expeditions are 
sent for special investigations. 

The principal aim of the observatory is the exact measurement of 
the intensity of the radiation of the sun as it is at mean solar distance 
outside the earth's atmosphere. This is ordinarily called the solar 
constant of radiation, but the observations of past years by this ob- 
servatory have proved it variable. As all life, as well as the weather, 
depends on solar radiation, the observatory has undertaken the con- 
tinued measurement of solar variation on all available days. These 
measurements have now continued all the year round for 12 years. 
As will appear in this report, recent studies indicate that the perma- 
nent continuation of these daily solar-radiation measurements may 
have great value for weather forecasting. In addition to this prin- 
cipal object the observatory undertakes spectroscopic researches on 
radiation and absorption of atmospheric constituents, radiation of 
special substances, such as water vapor, ozone, carbonic-acid gas, 
liquid water, and others, and the radiation of the other stars as well 
as of the sun. 

WORK AT WASHINGTON 

Funds having been appropriated by the Congress to print Volume 
V of the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory, the year was spent 
principally in preparing text, tables, and illustrations expressing the 
results of observations made since August, 1920, at the several 
stations. 

117 



118 ANNXTAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

As stated in previous reports, much effort had already been ex- 
pended in reducing the observations made at Table Mountain, Calif., 
but without satisfactory results. The atmosphere above Table Moun- 
tain, though to the eye appearing very fine and clear, contains va- 
riable amounts of ozone, water vapor, and dust, which produce 
embarrassing difficulties in computing the solar constant of radiation. 
Daily measurements of the amount of atmospheric ozone by the 
method of Dobson had been in progress at Table Mountain, since 
August, 1928, but they require fully as much time for reduction as 
does the solar constant itself. Fortunately, as described in last year's 
report, we were able to devise a simple method based on our holo- 
graphic work whereby corrections can be made easily for the absorp- 
tion of ozone on all days when solar-constant measures are made at 
Table Mountain. All the Table Mountain solar-constant values from 
the beginning there in 1925 have now been corrected for ozone 
absorption. 

The changes of haziness and of absorption associated with varia- 
tions of atmospheric water vapor make a difficulty of a more serious 
nature. After several unsuccessful attempts to vary the Montezuma 
procedure to suit Table Mountain conditions, the process of reduction 
of the short-method solar-constant determinations at Table Moun- 
tain was radically changed. It will be recalled that the essence of 
the short method consists in employing pyranometer measurements 
of the brightness of the sky near the sun as an index of the prevailing 
atmospheric transparency. 

If the brightness of the sky were unaffected by varying quantities 
of smoke or dust, we should expect the normal change of its bright- 
ness from day to day to be exactly determined by the quantity of 
atmospheric water vapor prevailing. In other words, there would be 
a normal relation between pyranometry, precipitable atmospheric 
water vapor, and atmospheric transparency, for the different wave 
lengths. But if unusual degrees of dustiness or smokiness prevail, 
then the pyranometer will record a positive or negative excess from 
the normal value proper to the prevailing quantity of precipitable 
water. This " excess " will be associated with changes in the atmos- 
pheric transmission coefficients for all wave lengths. 

On these lines we have worked out new varieties of the short 
method of determining the solar constant of radiation applicable to 
conditions at Table Mountain and Mount Brulvkaros. We have re- 
reduced all the observations made at these stations according to these 
new methods. Great improvement in their solar-constant deter- 
minations resulted, although it must be confessed that neither of 
these two stations yields results as generally satisfactory as does 
Montezuma. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 119 

COMPAlilSON OF RESULTS 

With the coinpletion of the reduction of all the solar-constant 
observations from the three field stations results of much interest are 
found by comparing them. Figure 1 shows the monthly mean solar- 
constant values derived from Table Mountain, Montezuma, and 
Mount Brukkaros since 1926. The probable error of the weighted 
mean curve shown as a heavy line in Figure 1 is less than 0.1 per cent. 
In short, it is adequately accurate to show all that needs be known 
of the general march of solar variation. 

Figure 2 shows the preferred monthly mean solar-constant values 
from 1920 to 1930, inclusive. The extreme range of it is 2.8 per cent. 
Although apparently so irregular, Figure 3 shows that the march of 
solar variation may be expressed with surprising fidelity as the sum 
of five regular periodicities, of 68, 45, 25, 11, and 8 months' intervals. 
It is interesting to note that, though derived with no regard to it, 
all of these intervals turn out to be nearly related to the lli4-year 
sun-spot period. Thus 68 months is its half, 45 months its third, 
and so on. Other periods are found which are not so long-lived as 
these. Thus, curve H in Figure 3 shows periods of 45 and 5.6 days, 
respectively, which lasted throughout the year 1924. The excellent 
representation of the original curve A by the sum of the five peri- 
odicities, as shown at B, encourages me to give in curve I the 
expected march of solar variation in 1931 and 1932. 

Figure 4 gives the results of an attempt to represent the tempera- 
tures of Washington, D. C, and Williston, N. Dak., as made up of 
periodicities having these same five intervals, 68, 45, 25, 11, and 8 
months. It proved necessary to add a period of 18 months in each 
case. The original temperature curves A and C are found by taking 
consecutive means of 5-month departures from normal. Thus, 1/5 
(Jan. + Feb. + Mar.+Apr.+May) : 1/5 (Feb. + Mar. + Apr. + May + 
June), and so on. This eliminates the shorter irregularities and 
brings out prominently the principal departures from normal tem- 
perature that have occurred since 1918. 

Curves B and D are 5-month consecutive means of curves repre- 
senting the observed march of temperature as the sum of the six 
periodicities above described. I do not insist that this method of 
treatment gives certainty as yet, but I look forward for five more 
years to 1936, when it can be subjected to a more rigorous test. Time 
will show whether or not it is the germ of the method of forecasting 
weather for future years, to which Langley looked forward when he 
founded the Astrophysical Observatory. 

The comparison of stations shows that the daily solar-constant 
values are not as accurate as are needed. Montezuma results are by 
far the best. Yet they lack many days of completeness and many

days represented are unsatisfactory. It is indeed almost beyond the 
limit of possible accuracy to observe the solar constant day after day 
with such exactness that the differences between the absolute values 
shall always evaluate changes correctly if reaching one-third of 1 per 
cent or more. This is what is needed. We have in mind a few 
improvements which may bring us to this degree of accuracy at 
Montezuma, but unless other stations superior to Table Mountain 
and Brukkaros are found it seems doubtful if fully satisfactory 
daily values are obtainable to supplement the Montezuma record.

-Washington nnd Willlston temperatures associated with solar periodicities. 
Five-month consecutive means 



Further studies made during the year tend to confirm the impres- 
sion stated in last year's report that temperatures and barometric 
pressures in the United States respond by opposite trends to positive 
and negative sequences of change in daily solar-radiation values. As 
yet, however, the evidence is not fully satisfactory owing to the 
imperfection of the daily record of solar changes, as just explained. 

To promote statistical studies along these lines, a new instrument 
designed to discover and evaluate periodicities in solar and weather 
records has been designed. Its construction was aided by a grant of 



EEPORT OP THE SECRETABY 123 

$1,000 from the Research Corporation of New York. At the close of 
the fiscal year the instrument was almost ready for use, having been 
constructed by A. Kramer at the instrument shop of the Observatory. 

FIELD STATIONS 

In cooperation with Doctor Wulf, of the Fixed Nitrogen Research 
Laboratory, of the Department of Agriculture, an investigation has 
been carried through at Table Mountain, Calif., on the absorption of 
well-determined quantities of ozone in the visible spectrum. In this 
research, ozone-laden air contained in special absorption cells was 
interposed before the slit of the spectrobolometer which records the 
energy of the solar spectrum. A new, independent method of de- 
termining the atmospheric ozone content was worked out and ap- 
plied. Its results agree nearly with those determined by the method 
of Dobson. 

The daily observation of the solar constant of radiation has been 
carried on regularly at the three field stations: Table Mountain, 
Calif. ; Montezuma, Chile ; and Mount Bruldcaros, Southwest Africa. 
The latter station has been supported by grants from John A. 
Roebling. Impressed by the probability of useful weather applica- 
tions, Mr. Roebling has made a further grant to finance an expedi- 
tion of a year's duration in Africa and outlying regions to endeavor 
to find a site equal to Montezuma, Chile, for solar-radiation work. 
Accompanied by Mrs. Moore, A. F. Moore, who has had long experi- 
ence at our mountain observatories, occupied Fogo Island peak in 
the Cape Verde Islands for several weeks, and is now in Southwest 
Africa testing various high mountain sites in comparison with Mount 
Brukkaros. 

A fire caused by a kerosene heater destroyed the computing room 
at Montezuma station, with mathematical tables and instruments used 
in the reductions. The observations suffered a few days of delay 
before new tables could be sent, but no days were lost to the perma- 
nent record of the station. 

PERSONNEL 

At Washington the personnel is unchanged since the last report, 
except that Oliver Grant served as additional computer throughout 
the 3^ear in the preparation of Volume V of the Annals. Also George 
Cox served from November, 1930, on the reduction of ozone observa- 
tions and other computing. Both young men were compensated from 
the Roebling funds. 

C. P. Butler, formerly assistant at Montezuma, was placed in 
charge of that station on January 11, 1931, vice H. H. Zodtner, trans- 
ferred to Table Mountain to carry on there during the absence of 



124 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

A. F. Moore. Walter Watson, jr., reported for duty as assistant at 
Montezuma February 1, 1931. 

SUMMARY 

The principal work accomplished has been the development of 
new methods and the complete reduction of all solar-constant obser- 
vations made at the field stations since 1920. The results with 
accompanying text and illustrations have been collected and sent to 
press as Volume V of the Annals of the Observatory. Comparison 
of values shows that the variation of the sun indicated by monthly 
mean values since 1920 is determined with sufficient accuracy for 
all purposes. The probable error of monthly means is less than 0.1 
per cent. Solar changes found since 1920 range to 2.8 per cent. 
Daily observations are less satisfactory than monthly means, but 
improvements are proposed. An expedition is in Southwest Africa 
endeavoring to discover a site for a solar radiation observatory equal 
to Montezuma, Chile. A new instrument for the periodic analysis 
of solar and weather data is nearly completed. 

On the whole the outcome of 10 years of intensive study of solar 
radiation, as brought together in the text of Volume V of the Annals 
of the Observatory now in press, is very interesting. It encourages 
great hope that the causes of weather may be traced in solar variation 
to such a degree as to enable the skilled meteorologist to forecast 
principal changes of weather far in advance.

APPENDIX 8 

KEPORT ON THE DIVISION OF RADIATION AND 
ORGANISMS 

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi- 
ties of the Division of Radiation and Oriranisms during its second 
year ending June 30, 1931. 

RESEAECII IN PROGRESS 

Building around the central idea of a laboratory combining experi- 
mental work in biophysics with fundamental experimentation in 
physics and chemistry, researches have been carried forward in both 
these fields. The phototropic experiments upon oat coleoptiles 
previously reported have been carried further with considerable 
refinement of technique. The carbon dioxide assimilation of wheat 
has been studied as a function of intensity in artificial light. Pre- 
liminary experiments with algae have been initiated with a view to 
determining carbon dioxide assimilation as a function of wave length 
and intensity, growth rate as a function of wave length and inten- 
sity, and death point as a function of wave length, and time-intensity 
dosage. The propagating chamber which was developed by the 
division has been used in cooperation with the Department of Agri- 
culture for the purpose of investigating the effects of artificial light, 
humidity, and temperature upon the growth of certain desert and 
tropical plants. 

In the field of pure physics and physical chemistry the major 
part of the time has been devoted to the development of the necessary 
equipment for the general intensity and infra-red work contemplated. 
The intensity distribution in the mercury spectrum has been deter- 
mined directly. In cooperations with the Fixed Nitrogen Research 
Laboratory the spectra of HCl, HCN, and the halogen substitution 
products of benzene have been investigated in the region between the 
visible and 2/x. 

PHOTOTROPISM 

In a preliminary experiment the phototropic response of the oat 
coleoptile toward light was determined comparatively for different 
colors or spectral regions by means of light filters. The results of 
this experiment may be conveniently summed up in the accompjiny-

ing graph, Figure 1. The spectral regions used are indicated by the 
transmission curves. The wave lengths are plotted as abscissae and 
the jDercentages of light transmitted by the filters as ordinates. The 
continuous curves indicate the regions of transmission for each of 
the filters; the blue filter (B) transmitting the region between 4,000 
and 5,000 A units, the green filter (G) transmitting between 4,800 
and 5,900A units, the yellow filter (Y) transmitting all visible 
wave lengths longer than 5,300 A, and the red filter (R) transmit- 
ting all wave lengths longer than 5,900 xV. For the sake of convenience 
the observable response curves have been plotted upon the same dia- 
gram in dotted lines. Tlie response in the red was found to be zero. 
The response to yellow light has been arbitrarily assigned the value 
" unity." Using a logarithmic scale (inside the frame) the relative 
responses in green and blue have been indicated. In the right-hand

curve each point is i)lottcd at the wave-length center of gravity of 
the region for each filter, in the case of yellow, only counting those 
wave lengths not included by the red filter. 

This curve plotted through these three points may be regarded as 
a first approximation. On the basis of this curve the centers of 
gravity were redetermined where each wave length was weighted 
according to resi)onses as indicated by the first approximation curve. 
The middle curve was thus obtained by simply shifting the points 
to the weighed center of gravity wave lengths. Using this second 
approximation curve as the basis for again reweighting, the third 
or left-hand curve was obtained. Reweighting was, of course, im- 
possible for the blue region, as data are not available on the shorter 
wave-length side. 

These results are presented for the sake of comparison with the 
results obtained in the more elaborate experiment carried out with

the use of a monochromator for obtaining narrower spectral regions 
or purer colors. In this way more points could be secured in deter- 
mining the response curve, and the amount of correction required for 
shift of center of gravity minimized. The results of this second 
experiment are shown in Figure 2. Points determined showing the 
relative response as a function of wave length are indicated by solid 
dots plotted on an arithmetic scale (inside frame). These points 
have again been plotted as crosses on a logarithmic scale as indicated 
outside the frame. The results of the earlier experiment are shown 
as circles.

Agreement between the two experiments is quite striking consider- 
ing the rough nature of the earlier experiment. 

In the phototropic experiments the biological technique has been 
developed by Doctor Johnston and the intensity relations determined 
by Doctor McAlister. The demands upon physical technique were 
so extreme that special vacuum thermocouples had to be developed 
and the galvonometer deflection measured by means of a thermal 
relay. 

It is interesting to note in this connection that Blaauw had secured 
similar curves for phototropic response, measuring instead of relative 



128 AISriTUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

intensity, the time required for the first observable response. That 
these curves determined by time of initial response should be almost 
identical to those determined by quantitative intensity ratios strongly 
points to a possible time-intensity product as the effective factor in 
controlling the phototropic response. This is particularly interest- 
ing, as such a relation is found to hold to a first approximation in the 
case of photographic plates on the one hand and the erythema 
dosage for the human skin on the other, as well as in most simple 
systems. 

PHOTOSYNTHESIS 

Special all-vitreous growth chambers have been developed wherein 
the carbon dioxide assimilated by wheat plants can readily be de- 
termined. The accompanying illustration (pi. 1, fig. 1) indicates the 
type of chamber developed ; the plants are inserted through holes in 
the cork stopper and held in place by cotton, the roots being 
immersed in a nutrient solution contained in the Erlenmeyer flask: 
the leaves extend upward in a special tubular compartment. This 
tubular compartment is double walled, permitting the circulation 
of water for the maintenance of temperature. Illumination is 
secured through these lateral walls. For experimentation with the 
blue and ultra-violet similar containers have been made of corex. 
Air is conditioned by a humidifier and introduced through an air- 
flow regulator into the base of the leaf chamber. It is expelled at the 
top and a portion passed through a conductivity cell. The variation 
in carbon-dioxide content is thus determined by changes caused in 
the conductivity of a potassium hydroxide solution. The record is 
made continuously by a Leeds and Northrup automatic bridge. 

In later experiments eight 300-watt lights mounted upon adjustable 
arms were substituted for those shown. Thus 2,400 watts could be 
placed at any distance from 20 centimeters to a meter, the illumina- 
tion being lateral and strictly symmetrical. A thermocouple with a 
cylindrical receiver is introduced through the top in order to deter- 
mine accurately the relative intensities for different adjustments. 
The accompanying diagram (fig. 3) shows a typical run carried out 
during a single day, showing the carbon dioxide assimilated for each 
different light intensity. 

To a first approximation the curve is apparently made up of two 
straight-line segments. While this appears to support the classical 
theory of Blackman concerning limiting factors, no such conclusion 
should be drawn until more rigid control can be maintained. The 
small changes in values which maj^ result may be sufficient to obliter- 
ate the apparent linearity. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 129 

This work differs from earlier work in that it is carried out with 
entire plants instead of individual leaves cut from plants as pre- 
viously used. The results presented must be regarded as simply 
preliminary, since certain difficulties are yet to be overcome. These 
experiments are preparatory for those contemplated wherein approxi- 
mately monochromatic light will be used. The development of 
equij^ment for this more elaborate experiment is nearing completion. 

In this work Doctor Johnston has carried out the physiological 
phases of the experiment and Mr. Hoover has perfected the carbon 
dioxide recording apparatus loaned to the division by the Fixed 
Nitrogen Research Laboratory and has carried out the observations 
with this instrument.

ALGAE INVESTIGATIONS 

As a result of the cooperation of the Department of Agriculture 
Doctor Meier has been able to initiate a program of algae investi- 
gations which will be extended through the following year as a 
part of her work as National Research Council Fellow in the divi- 
sion. Preliminary experiments have been carried out in which the 
many special types of algae which she has collected have been sub- 
jected to different nutrient solutions, and to different temperature 
and illumination conditions, with a view to determining the condi- 
tions required for the experiments contemplated. 

She has found that certain varieties may be grown in a colorless 
condition in the dark and subsequently gain their normal coloration

upon exposure to light. These will be used for experiments in which 
coloration is determined as a function of wave length and intensity. 

Provision has been made for growing a large number of algae 
cultures under comparable conditions. For this purpose two tables 
have been constructed, each with four glass-bottomed reservoirs. 
Small Erlenmeyer flasks containing solution cultures of algae are 
immersed in these large water baths and illuminated by artificial 
light from below. A circulating system maintains each set of four 
reservoirs at the same temperature. The small Erlenmeyer flasks 
containing the algae are maintained in agitation by a common driv- 
ing mechanism. Only the illumination is different in one reservoir 
from that in another. Thus the effect of modifying wave length or 
intensity may be determined for 18 different samples at once. The 
flasks may be supplied with small manometers in order to make a 
rough check on the photosynthetic processes as they are affected by 
growth and modification of conditions of illumination. All this 
work, however, is simply an auxiliary to the more careful experiment 
to be carried out intensively in a modified Warburg apparatus 
wherein differential nephelometric measurements are made as well as 
the usual maiiometric measurements upon oxygen concentration. The 
apparatus for these more refined measurements is in process of 
construction. 

A large quartz spectrograph has been constructed, using two quartz 
prisms some 15 cm on a side with quartz lenses of a 60 cm focal 
length. By means of the spectrograph unicellular organisms distrib- 
uted uniformly on a slide or in a culture dish may be exposed simul- 
taneously to different regions of the spectrum. Modifications in 
growth rate or resulting death point may be observed comparatively 
for different wave lengths. In Plate 1, Figure 2, the results of a pre- 
liminary exposure of algae are readily observed. For all wave 
lengths shorter than 3,000 A the typical mercury lines appear just 
as they would be seen on a photographic plate. Plere, however, they 
are recorded by the absence of the organisms after a week's growth 
subsequent to exposure. It should be noted that although the lines 
on the long-wave length side of 3,000 A are stronger by actual ther- 
mocouple determination they have not affected the algae colony. 

For convenience. Figure 5 may be referred to in this connection, 
which shows the relative intensities of the different lines of the mer- 
cury arc as determined in an experiment to be discussed later in 
another connection. 

By a succession of such experiments, wherein the first noticeable 
killing can be determined for different exposure times, the relative 
dosage of different wave lengths can be determined.

REPORT OP THE SECRETARY 131 

COOPERATIVE WORK WITH THE BUREAU OF PLANT INDUSTRY, DEPARTMENT 

OF AGRICULTURE 

A first experiment has been carried out in the general plan of co- 
operation between the United States Department of Agriculture and 
the division, in the crop physiology and breeding investigations of 
Dr. Walter T. Swingle. In this experiment the effects of controlled 
radiation, humidity, and temperature on certain tropical and xero- 
phji;ic plants were investigated in a preliminary way. The results 
may be summed up as follows : 

First, it was found possible to maintain conditions which yielded 
in the case of date palms, ten times greater growth rate than that 
exhibited by the control plants in the greenhouse (pi. 2). Second, 
humidity was shown to be a controlling factor in the growth of date 
palms. Third, the ephedra under these conditions yielded two crops, 
both larger than the single crop grown in the greenhouse. Fourth, 
conditions maintained, perhaps due to the red-rich, blue-poor radia- 
tion, yielded exceptional root development in both palms and pan- 
dani- Fifth, pandani have shown exceptional offshoot development, 
a matter of great significance in propagation of identical individuals. 
If the same proves true of palms, as seems likely, this result is of 
considerable practical importance. 

In this experiment the plant conditions and developments were 
in the hands of Dr. Florence E. Meier, associate physiologist in the 
Bureau of Plant Industry. Members of the division assisted during 
the experiment by the development of control apparatus in connec- 
tion with a propagating chamber for maintenance of constant 
humidity and temperature. 

In further preparation for the cooperative program the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture has constructed four additional individual 
growth chambers of a larger and slightly modified design but in 
general similar to the four already constructed by the division. A 
humidifier to serve all the individual growth chambers has been 
constructed by their shops and is in progress of installation. It 
should be possible to begin experimentation vnth these individual 
growth chambers some time during the coming fall. 

SPECTROSCOPIC DEVELOPMENTS

A large spectrograph, equipped with salt prisms, which will record 
intensity distribution of radiation from the visible to 15/i in the deep 
infra-red, is nearly completed. A preliminary grating set-up shows

remarkable possibilities of an old grating ruled for the Smithsonian 
by Rowland for infra-red work shorter than 6/i. Two echelette 
gratings have been ruled for the division by the Johns Hopkins 
University and have been given preliminary tests in the near infra- 
red. While these tests have so far been discouraging, they may 
still prove satisfactory in the deeper infra-red beyond Qfx, for which 
they were more particularly designed. 

The near infra-red work has been continued in cooperation with 
the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory. Investigations of the

halogen derivatives of benzene have been extended; the near infra- 
red spectrum of HCN has been investigated in both liquid and vapor, 
the results being presented at the Pacific coast meetings of the Physi- 
cal Society during the summer. Investigations of HCl in vapor and 
dissolved in carbon tetrachloride have been carried out with a view 
to determining the rotational freedom existing in such solutions. 
This work has been carried out by Doctor Brackett, in association 
with Urner Liddel and Dr. Oliver Wulf, of the Fixed Nitrogen 
Research Laboratory.

The energy distribution in the mercury arc has been measured by 
Doctor McAlister at a resolution 10 times greater than the previous 
work. These results were presented at meetings of the Physical 
Society. This work has been made possible through the loan of two 
quartz monochromators by the Bausch & Lomb Optical Co. Figure 
4 shows by the solid line the spectrum plotted with a single mono- 
chromator; it is replotted with dotted lines where two monochrom- 
ators are used, arranged so that the light passed first through one

and then through the other. It will be seen that not only is the 
background of energy observed between lines greatly reduced, but 
also the lines are much narrowed, or, in other words, the resolution 
is greatly increased. The intensities of the lines are only reduced 
by a factor of two where the resolution and freedom from scattering 
is increased by a larger factor. Figure 5 shows tlie spectrum plotted 
with the double monochromator arrangement but a still narrower 
slit. 



134 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

As a result of these measurements of spectral distribution in the 
visible and ultra-violet, an invitation has been extended to the divi- 
sion to be represented on the committee on ultra-violet measurement 
standards of the Illuminating Engineers Society. Doctor McAlister 
represented the division in the first of these meetings during the 
summer, where plans were made for cooperation in the development 
of suitable standard sources and technique for intensity measurement. 

THERMOCOUPLE TECHNIQUE 

As a result of the development of the specially sensitive vacuum 
thermocouples by members of the division many requests have come 
in for the construction of couples for other institutions. This has 
been possible only in exceptional cases. Couples have been con- 
structed for the University of California, for the Department of 
Agriculture, and for the General Electric Co. 

As an adjunct of these highly sensitive couples a special thermo- 
couple multiplier has been developed which is capable of magnify- 
ing galvonometer deflections by any desired ratio up to 1,000 times. 
It has the special advantages of making this magnification linearly 
for any amplitude and of introducing no appreciable added instabil- 
ity into the measurements. This technique is applicable not only to 
the infra-red investigations but also to the phototropic experiment 
where the measurement of extremely small intensities is required. 

REPORT ON THE WORK OF INDIVIDUALa 

Dr. Earl S. Johnston, plant physiologist, became a full-time mem- 
ber of the staff in February, 1931. Doctor Johnston began his work 
with the division as a consultant while still a professor at the Univer- 
sity of Maryland. He has taken an active part in the plans and de- 
velopments along the lines of plant physiology almost from the 
beginning. His addition to the staff has made possible much more 
rapid progress in the biological phases of the work. He has aggres- 
sively pushed the phototropic experiments and the wheat experiment, 
and has assisted in the preliminary growth chamber experiment. His 
assistance in matters of publication has been very valuable. 

Dr. E. D. McAlister became a member of the staff in September, 
1930, devoting half of his time to the work of the division and the 
other half to the work of the Research Corporation. During the 
latter part of the year all his time was assigned to the work of the 
division. Doctor McAlister's long experience in thermocouple tech- 
nique and infra-red measurements makes him unusually well qualified 
for the work of the division. He has carried out the most exacting 
phases of thermocouple observations on intensity and wave-length 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 135 

distribution in the phototropic experiment. He has materially con- 
tributed to the development of the preliminary growth chamber and 
controls. He has carried out an investigation on the distribution of 
the mercury arc in the blue and ultra-violet. He has furthermore 
handled a large }>art of the technical developments of thermocouples. 
This is in addition to his work with the Kesearch Corporation, for 
which he has carried out exhaustive investigations of the possibilities 
of the thermopile for use as a source of electromotive force in ap- 
plied fields. He has carried out preliminary developments of the 
nephylometer for general experimental use. 

Leland B. Clark, in addition to carrying on all the regular ghass- 
blowing, lias handled tlie vacuum technique development in connec- 
tion with the thermocouples. He has constructed a practical butjdph- 
thalate pump of original design. His assistance in many phases of 
special laboratory technique is of great value to the division. 

William H. Hoover has carried out a large part of the equipment 
and operation of the preliminary growth chamber; he has adjusted 
and increased the sensitivity of the carbon dioxide detecting device 
loaned to the division by the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory 
and he has installed and put in operation temperature-control equip- 
ment for the individual wheat experiment. He has designed and in- 
stalled a new thermostat which greatly increases the stability of the 
carbon dioxide recording mechanism. This is in addition to his 
work with the Astrophysical Observatory, for whom during the year 
he has spent a month in the development of photometric equipment 
and two months on a trip to Table Mountain, as well as some com- 
putational work on the annual report. 

Miss Stanley, in addition to the regular stenographic work, now 
a considerable load, has ably handled all our bookkeeping in con- 
nection with purchases. 

L. A. Fillmen, a mechanic of wide experience in apparatus and 
equipment construction, became a half-time member of the staff in 
August, 1930. His experience and ability have contributed largely 
in the development of equipment for the laboratory. Through the 
courtesy of the Fixed Nitrogen Kesearch Laboratory, Mr. Fillmen 
worked for several months in their shop while our shop was being 
equipped.

EXTENSION or HOUSING 

The large room No. 14 of the basement was added to the laboratory 
in order to provide for the intensity measurements in the visible 
and ultra-violet and development of the algae and wheat experiments. 
Partitions have been built in order to provide sufficient dark-room 
space. A room has also been constructed in order to make possible 
the accommodation of a glass-blowing course, which Mr. Clark has 
undertaken for the Department of Agriculture. Koom No. 12 has 
been equipped as a thoroughly up-to-date machine shop by the 
Research Corporation, with whom the division shares Mr, Fillmen's 
time. Room No. 13 has been equipped for the shopwork of the 
members of the division. 

COOPERATION 

The division has been especially fortunate in the cordial coopera- 
tion of other institutions. This includes near infra-red work with 
the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, experiments in higher 
plants with the Bureau of Plant Industry, sharing of equipment and 
personnel with the Research Corporation, personal assistance from 
the Astrophysical Observatory, assistance in the form of apparatus 
and equipment from the Bausch & Lomb Optical Co. and the General 
Electric Co. 

GENERAL 

In undertaking experimental work along those biological lines 
wherein radiation plays an important part it is inevitable that men 
are required with special training and experience not only in biology 
but also in the fields of physics and chemistry. To bring about the 
cooperation in these border-line problems of men with specialized 
training in each of these fields has been the essential dominating 
idea in the development of the division. The lack of men with 
specialized chemical training in the organic and photochemical fields 
is more and more keenly felt. Furthermore although the division is 
well provided with people of highly specialized training in the field 
of plant physiology and physics it is handicapped by the lack of 
sufficient laboratory assistance in order to carry out their ideas and 
make their time effective. Without increasing its program or widen- 
ing the scope of its activities the division urgently needs sufficient 
funds to round out its personnel in this way. 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 137 

SUMMARY 

The end of the second year finds the research work of the division 
well under way with preliminary results on phototropism, and on 
carbon dioxide assimilation of wheat; algae experiments on light 
adaptation have been initiated; promising experimental work has 
been begun in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture; and 
spectroscopic measurements have been completed in both the ultra- 
violet and infra-red. The laboratory space has been extended and 
equipped for the expansion of the work. Shop facilities have been 
added to care for the apparatus development. Essential additions 
have been made to the division personnel in both the physiological 
and physical sides of the project.

APPENDIX 9 

REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF 
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE 

Sir : I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera- 
tions of the United States Regional Bureau of the International 
Catalogue of Scientific Literature for the fiscal year ending June 30, 
1931. 

The routine work of the bureau, consisting mainly of compiling 
necessary records of current American scientific publications to be 
indexed for the catalogue when publication is resumed, has been 
continued. 

In compliance with the resolution passed at the last international 
convention held in Brussels in July, 1922, this bureau has been kept 
in existence. This resolution, unanimously adopted, was " That the 
convention is of opinion that the international organization should 
be kept in being through mutual agreement to continue as far as 
possible the work of the regional bureaus until such time as it may be 
economically possible to resume publication." Complying with the 
intent of the resolution, this bureau has been continued, though with 
a force of only two employees, in order to keep the enterprise alive 
with the lowest possible expenditure of money. Each year part of 
the regular annual congressional appropriation has reverted to the 
Treasury ; this year, out of the appropriation of $8,145, only $5,624. 
was spent, and thus $2,521 will revert. 

This bureau is making every effort through the chairman of the 
executive committee, in whom authority to reorganize is vested, to 
influence the other bureaus to take the steps necessary to resume 
publication, but on account of depressed financial conditions still ex- 
isting and the disorganized political situation in some countries no 
definite plan has yet been advanced. This is a situation to be de- 
plored, for nothing has ever taken the place of the catalogue, and its 
need in the world of science becomes ever more obvious. Aside from 
the necessary cooperation by the regional bureaus in furnishing clas- 
sified references for the Catalogue, a capital fund estimated at $75,- 
000 is needed to refinance the central bureau, the editing and pub- 
lishing center of the enterprise, and it seems probable that when a 
definite plan is presented some of the great endowed foundations 
interested in this and similar fields will provide this comparatively 
small sum. 
138 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 139 

Dr. Ernest Gushing Richardson, one of the great international 
authorities on bibliography, stated in a paper on the International 
Catalogue published in Science, June 20, 1930 : 

♦ * * The research endowments are bomharded with bibliographical 
projects of varying method and degrees of merit. They aid or support a good 
many projects. They are deeply concerned as trust organizations to put their 
money where it will do the most good. Other things being equal, they prefer 
to put it where one dollar will do the work of four. * * * It is here they 
can give the most bibliographical service with the least money. The proposi- 
tion touches the libraries in a very similar way. If and when the matter is 
revived it will depend for financing, if not on the endowments, than on library 
subscriptions. If this machine is scrapped, when a new one is started either 
a $3,000,000 endowment must be had from promoters of research or a quad- 
ruple price charged to libraries. 

Respectfully submitted.

Assistant in Charge.

APPENDIX 10 

KEPORT ON THE LIBRARY 

Sir : I have the honor to submit the following report on the activ- 
ities of the Smithsonian libraiy for the tiscal year ended June 30, 
1931: 

THE LIBRAKY 

The library, or library system, of the Smithsonian Institution is 
made up of 46 separate libraries, each related in some special way to 
the work of the Institution and of the seven Government bureaus 
under its administrative charge. The chief of these is the Smith- 
sonian deposit in the Library of Congress. The others are the library 
of the United States National Museum, the Smithsonian office 
library, the Langley aeronautical library, and the libraries of the 
Astrophj^sical Observatory, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the 
Division of Radiation and Organisms, the Freer Gallery of Art, 
the National Gallery of Art, and the National Zoological Park, to- 
gether with the 36 sectional libraries in the National Museum. These 
collections, which number in all about 800,000 volumes, pamphlets, 
and charts, not to mention the thousands still uncatalogued, while 
they contain many publications on art, history, literature, philos- 
ophy, music, and education, pertain largely to science and tech- 
nolog3^ This important group of libraries has made available to 
Smithsonian cm})Ioyees and to American research workers in gen- 
eral, especially those connected with the various departments of 
the Government, most of the leading scientific publications of the 
world during one of its outstanding eras. Thus it has had a note- 
worthy part in carrying out since 1846 — the year in which the Smith- 
sonian began its activities — the will of James Smithson, the founder 
of the Institution. 

CHANGES IN STAFF 

During the last year there were several changes in the library 
staff. Miss Marian W. Seville was made head of the order depart- 
ment and promoted from the rank of library assistant to that of 
senior library assistant. Mrs. M. Landon Reed, who had served in 
the exchange department for some time on temporary appointment, 
was given a permanent position as clerk. Miss Margaret Moreland 
140 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY ] 41 

was advanced from the gi'ade of under library assistant to that of 
senior stenographer, to fill a new position established in the libra- 
rian's office at the beginning of the year. Miss Anna M. Link was 
promoted from the rank of minor library assistant to the place 
formerly occupied by Miss Moreland. Miss Virginia C. Whitney, a 
graduate in library science of George Washington Universit}^, was 
appointed minor library assistant to succeed Miss Link. The tempo- 
rary employees were Mr. Alan Blanchard, Mrs. Daisy Cadle, Mrs. 
Lewis Deschler, Miss Katherine Everhart, Mrs. Grace A. Parler, 
Miss Jennette Seiler, Miss Eleanor Spielman, and Mr. Clyde Wil- 
liams. 

EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS 

The collections in the library system have been built up partly by 
the early provisions of the copyright law, partly by purchase and 
gift, but to a very large extent by exchange, for from the first the 
Institution and its branches have exchanged their publications for 
those of other learned institutions and societies and for scientific and 
technical journals and monographs. These have come to the Smith- 
sonian libraiy by mail or through the International Exchange Serv- 
ice, which is administered by the Institution. 

In the course of the fiscal year just closed there came to the library 
by mail 24,594 packages and by the Exchange 1,688, each containing 
one or more publications. These were stamped, entered, and for- 
warded to the appropriate libraries of the system. Among the 
notable sendings, of which there were many, was one of 331 volumes 
and parts of Neerlandia from the Allgemeen Nederlandsch Verbond, 
at The Hague. This was assigned to the Smithsonian deposit. 

The publications received included 4,5G5 dissertations from the uni- 
versities of Basel, Berlin, Bern, Bonn, Breslau, Cornell, Erlangen, 
Gand, Giessen, Greifswald, Halle, Heidelberg, Helsingfors, Jena, 
Johns Hopkins, Kiel, Konigsberg, Leiden, Leipzig, Lund, Maiburg, 
Neuchatel, Pennsylvania, Rostock, Strasbourg, Tiibingen, Utrecht, 
Warsaw, and Ziirich, the Academy of Freiberg, and technical schools 
at Aachen, Berlin, Braunschweig, Dresden, Karlsruhe, and Ziirich. 

Of the 1,808 letters written by the library staff during the year — 
an increase of 97 over 1930 — nearly all had to do witli the exchange 
of publications. At the close of the year this correspondence was up 
to date. The number of publications obtained in exchange in re- 
sponse to special requests from the various libraries of the Institution 
was much larger than usual, or 3,590. Exchange relations for several 
hundred new publications were entered into, particularly on behalf 
of the Smithsonian deposit, the Langley aeronautical library, and the 
libraries of the National Museum and Astrophysical Observatory. 



142 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

GIFTS 

During the year the library received many gifts. Chief among 
these was one of several thousand volumes and pamphlets, together 
with a collection of important letters and photographs, from the 
library of the late Dr. George P. Merrill, head curator of geology. 
These were presented by Mrs. Merrill and the other heirs of the 
estate and are to be kept in the office formerly occupied by Doctor 
Merrill, both as a permanent memorial to him and as an outstanding 
addition to the library in the division of geology. Other valuable 
collections received were as follows: GOO publications of a general 
scientific nature from Mrs. Dora W. Boettcher, given in memory of 
her husband, F. L, J. Boettcher, who was once connected with the 
Smithsonian Institution; 386 volumes and pamphlets from the 
heirs of the estate of the late Dr. O. P. Hay, of the Carnegie 
Institution, who for some years before his death used the library 
in the National Museum almost daily and gave it many valuable 
publications; 34 volumes, especially on atomic weights, together 
with a package of letters from the first four Secretaries of the 
Smithsonian, from the late Dr. Frank Wigglesworth Clarke; 30 
publications by or about Prof. Henry Carvill Lewis, from his 
sister, Mrs. Edward S. Sayres; and 50 or more early numbers of 
periodicals on art, from Mrs. Marietta Comly. Among other gifts 
were 8 volumes on the history of Japan, from the Historiographical 
Institute, Tokyo; 4 volumes, namely, A Handbook of Mohammedan 
Decorative Arts, by M. S. Dimand, and Catalogue of European Dag- 
gers, Catalogue of European Court Swords and Hunting Swords, 
and Handbook of Arms and Armor, European and Oriental, by 
Bashford Dean, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art; and The 
Permian of Mongolia, by Amadeus W. Grabau, from the American 
Museum of Natural History. About 600 publications came from the 
American Association for the Advancement of Science, 267 from the 
International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, 255 from the Geo- 
physical Laboratory, 55 from the American Association of Museums, 
and many from the Library of Congress. 

Preeminent among the books presented to the library was a copy 
of Nippon, by Phillip Franz von Siebold, as reissued recently in five 
volumes by the Japaninstitut of Berlin. The narrative of the 
author's experiences in Japan during the years 1823 to 1830 is illus- 
trated with pictures of the Japanese people and life during that 
period. This handsome and costly work, highly significant for its 
worth both as art and as history, was given to the Smithsonian by 
G. A. PfeilTer, of New York, and was deposited in the library 
of the Freer Gallery of Art. Other unusual gifts included Machu 
Picchu, a Citadel of the Incas, by Senator Hiram Bingham, from

SMITHSONIAN DEPOSIT 

The Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress is, as has 
been said, the chief unit in the library system, numbering at present 
more than 500,000 volumes, pamphlets, and charts. It is peculiarly 
rich in scientific monographs, the reports, proceedings, and trans- 



144 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

actions of learned institutions and societies, and scientific and 
technical journals. To the scholar, therefore, particularly in the 
fields of natural history, physical science, and technology, the deposit 
offers a wealth of material. 

During the last fiscal year the Institution sent to the deposit 
20,879 publications — an increase of 1,735 over the year before — or 
2,626 volumes, 12,775 parts of volumes, 4,393 pamphlets, and 1,085 
charts. Of these, 4,565 were dissertations. Of the charts, 883 were 
maps and atlases which the Smithsonian, in the course of the reor- 
ganization of its library system, had selected as worthy of preserva- 
tion in its main library. Some of these were important manu- 
script maps; many of the others were also new to the division of 
maps in the Library of Congress. 

The number of publications obtained by the Smithsonian library 
in exchange to meet special needs in the deposit was 2.364, or 159 
more even than in 1930, when the records showed more than a two 
and a half fold increase over 1929 and almost a fivefold increase 
over 1928. This steady growth in the exchange service of the 
library on behalf of the deposit is worthy of note. 

In addition to the publications sent to the deposit, several thousand 
documents of foreign governments, which were received by the 
Smithsonian library, were forwarded, without being stamped and 
entered, to the division of documents in the Library of Congress. 

It might be added that toward the close of the year the Smith- 
sonian library, with the aid of the National Museum, especially the 
section of photography, took steps, at the happy suggestion of the 
chief of the Smithsonian division in the Library of Congress, to 
have portraits made of the founder and five Secretaries of the 
Smithsonian Institution to be hung in that division with those of 
other prominent scientists already there. When they are finished, 
they will be presented for this purpose. 

NATIONAL MUSEUM LIBRARY 

In the library system of the Smithsonian Institution the library 
of the United States National Museum ranks next in size and in- 
fluence to the Smithsonian deposit. Its 2 major and 36 minor col- 
lections are largely on natural history and technology. Tlie cata- 
logued items of the library total 79,407 volumes and 109,129 pam- 
phlets. During the fiscal year 1931 the accessions to it were 2,528 
volumes and 832 pamphlets, an increase of 375 over 1930. Many of 
these came by gift, more by purchase, but most by exchange. 

The year was one of much progress, in which the staff went far 
toward making the library a more complete and available instrument 
in the research work of the museum. This was the result partly of 
the appointment to the Museum and other permanent library rolls 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 145 

of the Smithsonian of several new trained assistants and partly of 
the increase in funds for the acquisition of material needed by the 
scientists which could not be obtained by exchange. The staff entered 
8,799 periodicals, substituting for the old system of entry a new sys- 
tem that is being employed extensively by libraries using Library of 
Congress cards. They catalogued 1,639 volumes, 785 pamphlets, 
and 17 charts, or 427 more than the previous year. They also, as in 
former years, did the cataloguing and entering for the library of the 
National Gallery of Art, the total number of publications thus 
treated being 311 and 533 respectively — tv/ice the number of 1930. 
They contributed 11,193 cards to the Museum catalogue and revised 
672 catalogue headings. They also added 8,036 cards to the shelf 
lists, and prepared almost as many duplicate cards for the union shelf 
list in the Smithsonian Building. They sent to the sectional libraries 
6,522 volumes and parts and to the members of the scientific staff 
for their personal use 1,419 reprints, many of which had come to light 
in the process of sorting the few remaining collections of miscel- 
laneous material in the library. They filed the Wistar Institute cards 
as the}'^ came in, and brought up to date the filing of the large accu- 
mulation of Concilium Bibliographicum cards of the author set, 
17,000 cards being added to this file. The current cards of the sys- 
tematic set were forwarded to the sections that have files on their 
special subjects. The number of volumes bound was 1,402, or 131 
more than in 1930. In this connection it may be added that more 
volumes than usual were completed by special exchange letters, the 
number of publications received in response to them being 1,090, an 
increase of 402 over the year before. 

The number of publications loaned to the staff of the Smithsonian 
and its branches totaled 7,221, more than one-third of which were 
charged in the reading room of the Arts and Industries Building. 
Of these the library borrowed 2,049 from the Library of Congress 
and 271 elsewhere. Loans of 142 publications were made to libraries 
not in the Smithsonian system. The number of volumes returned to 
ihe Library of Congress was 2,519 and to other libraries 407 — in each 
instance many more than usual. 

The main shelf list — that of the collection in the Natural History 
Building — was completed early in the year, and the work of taking 
an inventory was begun. This had to be discontinued, however, in 
the fall, owing to lack of help. 

Finally, attention should be called to the fact that even with the 
400 feet of new shelving that the Museum installed for the collection 
in 1930 the natural history library is still in a very crowded condi- 
tion. Sufficient space and equipment both to relieve its present con- 
gestion and to permit of growth for a period of years should be 
provided as soon as possible.

ANNUAL KEPOBT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 



During the year the Museum library staff was able to assist only 
a few of the sectional libraries with their special problems, including 
those in the divisions of plants, mammals, and geology. 

These libraries number 36, and are as follows :

Administrative assistant's office. 

American archeology. 

Anthropology. 

Biology. 

Birds. 

Botany. 

Echinoderma. 

Editor's office.

Physical anthropology. 

Proi)erty clerk's office. 

Reptiles and batrachians. 

Superintendent's office. 

Taxidermy. 

Textiles. 

Vertebrate paleontology. 

Wood technology. 



OrFICE LIBRARY 

The office library consists of works of general reference, sets of 
the publications of the Smithsonian and its branches, and of various 
foreign societies and institutions, as well as numerous publications of 
a less learned and more cultural and even recreational character for 
use during the leisure hours of the Smithsonian employees. The 
additions to the library in the course of the last 12 months were 686 
volumes and 32 pamphlets. The number of periodicals entered 
was 229. 

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY LIBRARY 

The library of the Bureau of American Ethnology contains 26,671 
volumes and 16,717 pamphlets, chiefly on the archeology, history, 
myths, religion, arts, sociology, language, and general culture of the 
early peoples of the Western Hemisphere, especially of the North 
American Indian. The collection was increased during the past year 
by 600 volumes and 190 pamphlets. The number of periodicals 
entered was 3,500, and of cards added to the catalogue 3,500. The 
number of volumes bound was 473. The loans were 875. 



ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY LIBRARY 

The library of the Astrophysical Observatory is closely related in 
content to the researches in astrophysics and meteorology that are 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 147 

being conducted by the Institution. It has 4,188 vohimes and 3,192 
pamphlets. The additions during the year were 180 volumes and 92 
pamplilets. The number of volumes bound was 127. 

RADIATION AND ORGANISMS LIBRARY 

The library of radiation and organisms is a small, highly special- 
ized collection pertaining to one of the newer interests of the 
Institution, for the furthering of which it recently organized a 
division. During 1930 publications bearing mainly on this interest 
to the number of 20 volumes, 1 pamphlet, and several periodicals 
were added, bringing the collection to 94 volumes, 9 pam])hlets, and 
6 charts. Space and equipment, adequate for some years to come, 
were provided for the library in the north tower of the Smithsonian 
Building. 

LANGLEY AERONAUTICAL LIBRARY 

The Smithsonian's well-known collection of aeronautical publica- 
tions is now deposited in the Library of Congress, where, under its 
own stamp and bookplate, it occupies a unique place in the division 
of aeronautics and is even more available as an aid in research than 
it was before 1930, when it was transferred from the Institution. It 
will continue to bear the name of the Langley Aeronautical Library, 
in memory of Samuel Pierpont Langley, who while Secretary of the 
Smithsonian made a notable contribution to the science of aero- 
nautics. Most of the collection once belonged to Doctor Langley, and 
to other experimenters associated with him, including Alexander 
Graham Bell, Octave Chanute, and James Means. The rest of it has 
been received from time to time by the Institution chiefly in exchange 
for its publications. The library contains 1,856 volumes and 1,056 
pamphlets. Among its items are sets, including most of the early 
numbers, of the aeronautical magazines, both American and foreign, 
and many other important publications, some of which are very rare, 
together with files of photographs, letters, and newspaper clippings. 

During the fiscal year just closed the Smithsonian library was in- 
strumental in increasing the Langley collection by 45 per cent more 
than in 1930, or by 122 volumes, 445 parts of volumes, and 133 
pamphlets. Most of these were obtained by exchange. In this con- 
nection it may be added that the library, cooperating with the divi- 
sion of aeronautics in the Library of Congress, entered into exchange 
relations, on behalf of the Langley collection, with 50 or more new 
aeronautical societies and institutions, and received in response to its 
special requests many publications. It is hoped that this service on 
the part of the Smithsonian library can be considerably enlarged in 
the near future.

148 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY 

The library of the National Gallery of Art contains many valuable 
works on art, both American and foreign, including sets of the lead- 
ing magazines. The collection numbers 1,243 volumes and 1,332 
pamphlets. During the last year its accessions were 145 volumes, 
166 pamphlets, and 533 periodicals. Most of these came by purchase 
and exchange. Numerous gifts were received, however, especially 
from Dr. William H. Holmes, director of the gallery, and James 
Townsend Russell, jr., honorary collaborator in Old World archeology 
in the National Museum. The number of volumes bound was 51. 

FREER GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY 

The library of the Freer Gallery of Art is a prominent member of 
the Smithsonian library system. As the collection has to do largely 
with the arts and cultures of the Far East, India, Persia, and the 
nearer east, it is not only a unique and valuable aid to those imme- 
diately connected with the gallery, as well as to visitors who come 
there for research, but in many of its items — notably those in Chinese 
and Japanese, not a few of which are extremely rare — it supple- 
ments to an unusual degree the collection in the oriental division of 
the Library of Congress. In the library, too, are works on the lives 
and art of various American painters, especially James McNeill 
Whistler, a large number of whose pictures are owned by the gallery. 
It also has numerous publications on the Washington manuscripts, 
the well-known fourth and fifth century manuscripts of the Bible, 
which are among the treasures of the gallery. 

The main library, which is kept permanently in the gallery, con- 
sists of 4,423 volumes and 3,148 pamphlets. Its accessions during the 
year just closed were 61 volumes and 150 pamphlets. The number 
of volumes bound was 20. In addition to its main library, the gallery 
has a special collection, numbering 814 volumes and 500 pa-mphlets, 
chiefly of archeological interest, which is for the use of its staff in 
the field. Among the significant publications deposited in the library 
during the year by the Smithsonian Institution were a copy of Nip- 
pon, by Phillip Franz von Siebold, and of Lo-Lang, by Yoshito 
Harada and Kingo Tazawa — two of the gifts described in more 
detail earlier in this report. The work of reclassifying and recata- 
loguing the collections, which was begun the year before, was carried 
almost to completion, 6,083 cards being added to the dictionary cata- 
logue of the library and a like number being prepared for filing in 
the union catalogue in the Smithsonian Building. This notable prog- 
ress was made possible bj" the further generous cooperation of the 
gallery with the Smithsonian library. Of the 435 visitors, 216 came

to study, 16 to make sketches from plates, and 203 to see the reproduc- 
tions of the Washington manuscripts. 

NATIONAIi ZOOLOGICAL PARK LIBRARY 

Among the 1,217 volumes and 407 pamphlets in the library of the 
National Zoological Park are many of great value to those interested 
in the care and habits of animals. Its additions for the year were 
four volumes and four pamphlets. 

SUMMARY OF ACCESSIONS 

The accessions for the year may be summarized as follows :

It is estimated that on June 30, 1931, the number of volumes, 
pamphlets, and charts in the Smithsonian library system was as 
follows : 

Volumes 578,057 

Pamphlets 192,477 

Charts 26, 346 

Total 796,880 

In addition to this total, there were, of course, many thousands of 
volumes still uncatalogued or awaiting comf)letion. 



UNION CATALOGUE 

Besides keeping up the current cataloguing work, the staff com- 
pleted the shelf list of the National Museum library and prepared 
a copy of part of it for filing with the union shelf list in the 
Smithsonian Building; catalogued and arranged the publications of 
the Carnegie Institution of Washington; finished cataloguing the 
John Donnell Smith collection, including a large set of miscellaneous 
publications, for which they prepared about 1,100 analytical and 
subject entries; began the recataloguing of the general botanical 
collection in the National Museum ; and, finally, made notable prog- 



150 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

ress in the work, begun the year before, of reclassifying and 
reeataloguing the library of the Freer Gallery of Art. 

The work on the union catalogue and shelf list may be summed up 
by the following statistics : 

Volumes catalogued 5, 127 

Volumes recatalogued 37 

Pamphlets catalogued 2, 754 

Pamphlets recatalogued 3 

Charts catalogued 219 

Typed cards added to catalogue 7, 896 

Library of Congress cards added to catalogue 14, 949 

Museum cards copied for union shelf list 13,219 

Freer cards prepared for union catalogue and shelf list, to be added 
later 7,551 

SPECIAL ACTIVITIES 

A number of special tasks were undertaken by the staff during 
the year. These were chiefly connected with the reorganization of 
the library system that has been going on for some time. 

Further progress was made in sorting the miscellaneous material 
in the west stacks of the Smithsonian Building, and hundreds of 
publications were found that were lacking in the libraries of the 
Institution, The art-room collection was checked and a list pre- 
pared for the National Gallery of Art. The regents' and archives' 
sets of Smithsonian publications were also checked and, so far as 
possible, the missing numbers supplied. The natural history col- 
lection in the National Museum was shifted and rearranged, to 
make it less crowded and more accessible, and a similar treatment 
of the technology collection was begun. 

Many publications — in some cases, whole files — not needed by the 
Institution or its branches, were transferred to other Government 
libraries. These included 1,935 publications of the United States 
Geological Survey, 904 of the Canadian Geological Survey, and 
100 of a miscellaneous character. They likewise included the rolls 
of 883 maps and atlases that had been stored for many years in 
the old Museum. 

Four hundred and fifty of the duplicates among the publications 
of the Carnegie Institution of Washington were sent back to that 
institution. In return the Carnegie give the Smithsonian many of 
the volumes that were lacking in its sets. The duplicate publica- 
tions of the University of California received similar treatment, 
476 items being returned to the university and a large number sent 
to the Institution toward completing its files. 

The librarian gave several lectures, on Shakespeare, Virgil, the 
Nature of Poetry, and the Smithsonian Institution, before various 



REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 151 

groups in Washington, including the Cosmos Club, the Shakespeare 
Society, the Classical Club, and American University. 

CONCLTJSION 

Despite the fact that the year was one of the most successful 
since the beginning of the reorganization of the library system in 
1924, much more could have been accomplished both for the libra- 
ries in the system and for the scientists and other employees of 
the Smithsonian if sufficient funds had been at hand for the purchase 
of all the books and periodicals not obtainable by exchange that 
were needed in the current work of the Institution; if the binding 
allotment had been large enough to permit the binding of all the 
volumes prepared during the year — as it was, 600 had to be held 
for months as they could not be sent to the bindery until after 
June 30; and, most of all, if it had been possible to employ more 
permanent trained assistants. Among the additional personnel 
needed on the library staif are several cataloguers and general library 
assistants, a typist, and a messenger. 

Respectfully submitted. 

William L. Corbin, Librarian. 

Dr. Charles G. Abbot, 
Secretary^ Smithsonian Institution. 



APPENDIX 11 
KEPOKT ON PUBLICATIONS 

Sik: I have the honor to submit the following report on the 
publications of the Smithsonian Institution and the Government 
bureaus under its administrative charge during the year ending 
June 30, 1931 : 

A consolidation of all the editorial work of the Institution and 
its branches, put in effect by the secretary on March 1, 1931, brought 
all of the 13 series of publications issued by the Smithsonian under 
the general direction of the editor. This step was taken in the 
interests of greater unity of editorial policy, more efficiency, and 
less duplication in the keeping of the many records, financial and 
otherwise, necessary in an editorial office, and, most important of all, 
greater accuracy and more prompt appearance of Smithsonian 
publications. 

On January 31, 1931, Dr. Marcus Benjamin, editor of the National 
Museum, retired after a service of 35 years. He was succeeded by 
Paul H. Oehser, formerly on the editorial staff of the Bureau of 
Biological Survey. Mr. Oehser and Mr. Stanley Searles, editor of 
the Bureau of American Ethnology, will continue in charge of the 
editorial work of their respective bureaus, but by centralizing the 
general direction of the work in the office of the editor of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, the advantage is gained of establishing a definite 
point of contact between heads of bureaus, authors, and the Govern- 
ment Printing Office. Furthermore, the same general style can now 
be adopted for all the series published under the Institution, so that 
authors, many of whom publish in several of the series, will know 
beforehand what style is expected. To aid toward this end, it is 
proposed to issue a condensed style sheet based on the Style Manual 
of the Government Printing Office, covering those matters that occur 
constantly in every manuscript and concerning which authors and 
typists are often in doubt. 

PUBLICATIONS ISSUED DURING THE TEAR 

The Institution proper published during the year 16 papers in the 

series of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, 1 annual report and 

pamphlet copies of the 24 articles contained in the report appendix, 

and 3 special publications. The United States National Museum 

152 



EEPORT OP THE SECRETARY 153 

issued 1 annual report, 1 volume of proceedings, 3 complete bulletins, 
1 j^art of a bulletin, 1 complete volume, 1 part and 1 index in the 
series Contributions from the National Herbarium, and 40 separates 
from the proceedings. The Bureau of American Ethnology pub- 
lished two annual reports and three bulletins. 

Of these publications there were distributed 205,711 copies, which 
included 29 volumes and separates of the Smithsonian Contributions 
to Knowledge, 27,425 volumes and separates of the Smithsonian Mis- 
cellaneous Collections, 25,984 volumes and separates of the Smith- 
sonian annual reports, 4,627 Smithsonian special publications, 37,967 
copies of the Brief Guide to the Smithsonian Institution, 86,680 
volumes and separates of the various series of the National Museum 
publications, 29,475 publications of the Bureau of American Eth-. 
nology, 118 publications of the National Gallery of Art, 1,355 publi- 
cations of the Freer Gallery of Art, 10 volumes of the Annals of the 
Astrophysical Observatory, 65 reports of the Harriman Alaska 
Expedition, and 1,036 reports of the American Historical Association.

and finally, in his will, probated November 6, 1919, he provided stock 
and securities to the estimated value of $1,958,591.42 as an endow-

ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 



During the year, the Institution received as gifts a total of approxi- 
mately $145,000, which included donations for specific uses not to 
be invested, for increase of endowments for specific purposes, and a 
small sum for the increase of the general endowment fund. 

All payments are made by check, signed by the Secretary of the 
Institution, on the Treasurer of the United States, and all revenues 
are deposited to the credit of the same account. In many instances 
deposits are placed in bank for convenience of collection and later 
are withdrawn in round amounts and deposited in the Treasury. 

The practice of investing temporarily idle funds in time deposits 
has proven satisfactor3\ During the year the interest derived from 
this source has resulted in a total of $5,026.75. 

The foregoing report relates only to the private funds of the 
Smithsonian Institution. The following is a statement of the 
congressional appropriations for the past 10 years for the support 
of the several governmental branches under the administrative 
control of the Institution and of appropriations for other special 
purposes during that period.

Present: Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, chancellor, in the 
chair, Vice President Charles Curtis, Senator Joseph T. Robinson, 
Representative Albert Johnson, Representative R. Walton Moore, 
Representative Robert Luce, Frederic A. Delano, Dr. John C. 
Merriam, and the secretary, Dr. C. G. Abbot. Dr. Alexander Wet- 
more, assistant secretary was also present. 

At the previous annual meeting of the board, the Langley gold 
medal for aerodromics was awarded to Charles Matthews Manly 
(posthumously) and to Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd. At the pres- 
ent meeting the actual presentation of the medal was made to Mr. 
Manly through his son Charles W. Manly. The chancellor made the 
address of presentation, and Mr. Manly accepted the medal on behalf 
of his family. Extracts from the remarks of the chancellor and Mr. 
Manly will be found in the Report of the Secretary of the Smithsonian 
Institution for 1931. 

Mr. Delano, chairman of the executive committee, offered the 
following customary resolution, which was adopted: 

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 
1932, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the 
secretary, with the advice of the executive committee, with full discretion on 
the part of the secretary as to items. 

The secretary presented his printed report for the fiscal year ending 
Jane 30, 1930. He stated that the publications of the Institution 
during the fiscal year 1930 totaled 95 volumes and pamphlets, of 
which 38 were issued by the Institution proper, 51 by the National 
Museum, and 6 by the Bureau of American Ethnology. Under the 
Institution's pohcy of world-\\ade distribution, 168,163 copies of its 
publications were sent out to organizations and individuals, for the 
most part free. 

Mr. Delano submitted the printed report showing the financial 
affairs of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1930. 

The annual report of the National Gallery of Art Commission was 
presented and accepted, and the following resolution was adopted: 

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution hereby 
approves the recommendation of the National Gallery of Art Commission that

of the commission for the ensuing term of four years, their present teims having 
expired. 

The matter of the purchase and erection of the Bush-Brown statue, 
The Indian Buffalo Hunt, was brought up, and on motion it was 
resolved to refer it to the executive committee with power to act. 

The secretary then presented a supplementary report, mentioning 
a number of special events and activities during the year. He spoke 
particularly of the support by the Research Corporation of the work 
of the Division of Radiation and Organisms; of continued generous 
gifts by John A. Roebling to aid the Institution's solar-radiation 
researches; of additions by Mr. Gellatly to the very valuable art 
collection previously given to the Institution; of the considerable 
sum already received in royalties from the sale of the Smithsonian 
Scientific Series; of the completion of the series North American Wild 
Flowers, by Mary Vaux Walcott; and of the important discoveries 
in European archives of early manuscripts relating to the Americas 
by Dr. C. U. Clark, working under a grant from Ambassador Charles 
G. Dawes. 

At the request of the Secretary, Doctor Wetmore described certain 
of the year's explorations under the Institution. Doctor Wetmore 
also spoke of the status of the proposed additional wings on each 
side of the Museum Building. 

It was announced that a telegram had been received from Admiral 
Byrd fixing March 27, 1931, as a convenient date for the presentation 
of the Langley gold medal awarded to him at the last meeting of the

170 AITNUAL EEPOKT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

Other matters of importance to the work of the Institution were 
then brought before the board for discussion. 



On March 27, 1931, as noted above, the Langley gold medal was 
presented to Admiral Byrd in the main hall of the Smithsonian 
Building in the presence of members of the Board of Regents and 
other distinguished guests. The presentation was made by Chancellor 
Charles E. Hughes; Admiral BjTd, in accepting the medal, spoke of 
his appreciation of the award and of his great respect for the work of 
Professor Langley. Further details of the presentation will be found

GENERAL APPENDIX 

TO THE 

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1931 



171 



ADVEKTISEMENT 

The object of the General Appendix to the Annual Rei^ort of the 
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific 
discovery in particular directions ; reports of investigations made by 
collaborators of the Institution ; and memoirs of a general character 
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous cor- 
respondents of the Institution, 

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the 
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual 
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more 
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological 
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations 
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this 
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such 
papers as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific 
progress. 

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum- 
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by 
well-known private publishing firms, the secretary had a series of 
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely 
the prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, 
geology, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zool- 
ogy, and anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though, not 
altogether satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888. 

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of 
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them origi- 
nal) embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and 
discussion. This method has been continued in the present report for 
1931.

TWENTY-FIVE YEAES' STUDY OF SOLAR RADIATION 



By C. G. Abbot 

Secretary, Smith sonian In-'^titution 

[With 3 plates] 



INFRA-RED SOLAR SPECTRUM MAP AND THE DISPERSION OF ROCK 

SALT 

Thirty years ago at Washington, under Dr. S. P. Langley's direc- 
tion, F. E. Fowle and I completed a map of the sun's invisible infra- 
red spectrum. Our map extended from Fraunhofer's "A," at wave 
length 0.76 micron, to a point far down in the infra-red of wave 
length 5.3 microns. We felt out and recorded the invisible spectrum 
lines with the photographic registering spectrobolometer. Langley 
used to say that in his use of the spectrobolometer on Mount Wliitney 
in 1881 the indicator often raced across the scale 1 meter long in a 
minute. We had so far tamed this wild creature by the year 1900 
that the indicator seldom wandered a centimeter in an hour. Never- 
theless, that delicate electrical thermometer, the bolometer, was then 
so sensitive that a deflection of a millimeter on the photographic 
recording scale corresponded to a temperature change of only 
0.000004° Centigrade. 

The infra-red solar spectrum map which we made between 1895 
and 1900 contained 740 lines. Their positions were recognized as 
cooled bits of the spectrum by the fine metallic sensitive thread of the 
bolometer. No doubt a considerable number of those 740 lines were 
spurious, for every tremor of the eartli and every accidental temper- 
ature change added its unwelcome deflections to the record. We 
eliminated the false and preserved the true, as well as we were able, 
by comparing many independent records. To fix the wave lengths 
we made a special investigation of the dispersion of rock salt prisms. 
Paschem repeated it later. His results agreed generally with ours 
in the fifth decimal place of the refractive index of rock salt. 

In 1928 H. B. Freeman and I went over a part of this infra-red 
spectrum again on Mount Wilson. We used three times as great 
dispersion as in the old work at Washington. In the region from 
0.76 to 1.8 microns we obtained about 1,300 lines where formerly we 
found about 550. Dr. H. D. Babcock, of the Mount Wilson Observa- 
tory, has done much photographic work covering a part of this upper 

175

infra-red solar spectrum region. He finds that our old bolometric 
work of 1000 deserved a good word as to the accuracy of the wave 
lengths and as to the general reality of the lines found and that our 
new work added to it some really useful detail. 





Many of the infra-red spectrum lines are now identified by investi- 
gators as due to specific elements in the gases of the sun, others to 
vapors in the earth's atmosphere. There were two mystery bands in 
the spectrum called wi and w. of wave length about 2.0 microns, 
which long puzzled us because we knew they were atmospheric but

surely not due to water vapor. I have seen quite recently some beau- 
tiful absorption spectra by H. J. Unger, of the University of Oregon, 
wliich prove that wi and a>2 are really caused by terrestrial carbonic 
acid gas.

Figure 2. — Simultaneous lowering of the sun's radiation and of the temperature of 
the earth's northern hemisphere as observed in March, 1903 

SOLAR-CONSTANT WORK BEGUN IN 1902 

Doctor Langley was deeply interested in the value of the solar 
constant of radiation, which is the measure of the intensity of the 
sun's rays as they are in free space at the earth's mean solar distance. 



178 ANNUAL REPOKT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

Hence, in the year 1902, we began a solar-constant research destined 
to be a very long one. At that time solar-constant values ranging 
from 1.76 to 4.0 calories were given in standard textbooks. 

Our earliest Washington work raised a question which has en- 
grossed us for over 25 years. Our results of 1902, 1903, and 1904 
seemed to indicate that the sun's output of radiation decreased rather 
suddenly in March, 1903, by about 10 per cent, and continued low 
thereafter. We should certainly have attributed this to obscure 
error if the temperature of the entire north temperate land area of 
the world had not shown a decrease at the same time. We think now 
that we were misled by an atmospheric turbidity caused by a vol- 
canic eruption in southern Mexico. At all events, we began then to 
suspect that the sun is a variable star and that its fluctuations pro- 
duce important weather changes. I hope now, after more than 25 
years of investigation, to present evidence to convince you that such 
is really the case. 

The determination of the solar constant of radiation involves two 
principal parts. First, the exact measurement of the intensity of 
solar radiation as received at the observing station ; second, the exact 
estimation of the loss which the rays suffer in traversing the atmos- 
phere. The first requirement involves an accurate pyrheliometer. 
The second requirement involves exact measurements of the atmos- 
pheric transmission coefficients for all important solar spectrum rays. 
Besides this, there must be estimates of the relative transmissibility 
of the spectral rays in the optical apparatus, and of the atmospheric 
transmission of those feeble parts of the solar spectrum lying in the 
ultra-violet and the infra-red beyond the limits of the spectrum 
region usually observed. 

THE SILVER-DISK PYRHELIOMETER 

When we began solar-constant work in 1902, the beautiful electrical 
compensation pyrheliometer of Knut Angstrom was already avail- 
able, though not fully perfected. Following, however, in Langley's 
path, we developed for our use the older form of pyrheliometer of 
Pouillet and Tyndall. With us it became in 1910 the well-known 
silver-disk pyrheliometer, of which the Smithsonian Institution has 
since furnished more than 60 standardized copies at cost to solar- 
radiation observers in all parts of the world. 

The silver-disk pyrheliometer, though simple, effective, and ac- 
curate, and capable of maintaining a constant scale of readings for 
many years, is not an independent standard. Means are required 
to reduce its scale to true calories per square centimeter per minute. 
For this purpose we developed the standard water-flow and water-

stir pyrheliometers. Our findings with these instruments are ex- 
pressed as the so-called *■' Smithsonian Pyrheliometry of 1913," 
which has been accepted quite generally as the standard pyrhelio- 
metric scale of the world. It differs by about 3 per cent from the 
Angstr()m scale. Experiments by independent methods are now in 
j)rogress in Germany to further establish the true pyrheliometric 
scale. 

THE STANDARD WATER-FLOW PYRHELIOMETER 

In the standard water-flow pyrheliometer, the solar rays admitted 
by a measured aperture are chieflj^ absorbed on a hollow blackened 
metallic cone at the rear of a test-tube-shaped blackened metallic 
chamber. A measured current of water continually removes the 
heat produced on the cone and on the inner walls of the chamber.

An electrical thermometer measures the rise of temperature thus 
produced in the water current. For test purposes, known quantities 
of heat may be introduced at the cone by measured electrical cur- 
rents. The accuracy of the instrument, which is very satisfactory, 
is measured by the equivalence of heat introduced and heat found. 
The instrument is represented in Figure 3. 

THE FUNDAMENTAXf SOLAR-CONSTANT METHOD 

The fundamental solar-constant method as worked out by Langley 
involves determining the intensity of all parts of the solar spectrum 
repeatedly on a day of unchanging clearness, so as to disclose the 
increase of intensity of each spectral ray which occurs as the sun 
mounts higher and higher. For a ray of homogeneous wave length, 
the intensity is connected with the length of path in the atmosphere 
by the exponential formula of Lambert and Bouguer : 

6=6^11^; or log e=m log a-{-log c„ 

Here e is the observed intensity; e^ that which would be observed oiitside 
the atmosphere ; a is the fraction transmitted with vertical sun ; and m is the

180

air mass, or in other words the ratio of the length of path of the ray in the 
atmosphere to that obtaining with vertical sun. In its logarithmic form the 




formula is the equation of the straight line. We find it satisfactorily exact on 
many days at our excellent high-altitude stations in California, Chile, and 
South West Africa. 



SOLAR RADIATION ABBOT 181 

Since the formula holds strictly only for rays of homogeneous 
Avave length, we require spectrum measurements. If from a series 
of holographs of the solar spectrum, in which the partial transmissi- 
bility of the optical instruments has been allowed for, we determine 
atmospheric transmission coefficients for about 40 selected wave 
lengths between 0.34 and 2.5 microns, we can compute the intensity 
which each of these rays would represent if observed outside the 
atmosphere. This determines the sun's spectrum energy curve as it 
would be observed in free space. If we compute the area included 
under the curve thus determined, and divide it by the area included 
by the curve observed by the spectrobolometer, the quotient is the 
factor by which we must multiply the total intensity of the solar 
beam as measured by the pyrheliometer to give the intensity which 
the pyrheliometer would have read if in free space. Correcting the 
result to mean solar distance, we have the solar constant of radiation. 

TRANSMISSIBILITY OF OPTICAL APPARATUS 

As required for solar-constant determinations, we have made many 
measurements of the relative transmissibility of our optical instru- 
ments for the different spectral rays. Our procedure involves two 
spectroscopes, of which the auxiliary one delivers its spectrum upon 
the slit of the main one used for the holographic work. Under these 
circumstances, we measure with the bolometer the intensity of many 
spectral rays both before and after they traverse the main spec- 
troscope. Their relative transmissibilitj^ appears in the ratios of 
these measurements. 

WAVE-LENGTH DISTRIBUTION OF SOLAR RADIATION, AND THE SUN'S 
EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE 

Such determinations of transmission in the optical train, together 
with the determinations of transmission in the atmosphere, enabled 
us to represent and tabulate the distribution of energy in the solar 
spectrum as it is outside our atmosphere. Our best results in this 
line were published in 1923 in a paper entitled " The distribution of 
energy in the spectra of the sun and stars." ^ They have been of use 
to other investigators for various purposes. 

If we assume that the sun is approximately a perfect radiator, our 
work on the solar constant yields three methods of estimating his 
effective temperatures : First, from the spectral position of maximum 
intensity. Second, from the general form of the curve of distribu- 
tion of energy in the spectrum. Third, from the sun's distance and 
diameter combined with the value of the solar constant of radiation.

These methods yield absolute centigrade temperatures as follows : 
6,170° ; 6,200° ; 5,750°. The discrepancy is rather wide, but is, I think, 




caused by the fact that the sun differs in several respects from a per- 
fect radiator of uniform temperature. 



SOLAR RADIATIOISr ABBOT 183 

THE MEAN VALUE OF THE SOLAR CONSTANT OF RADIATION 

The solar-constant methods just described were used exclusively 
at Washington from 1902 to 1905; at Bassour, Algeria, in 1911 and 
1912, and at Mount Wilson, Calif., from 1905 to 1920. Only one, or 
at most two, determinations per day resulted from them, and they 
were at the mercy of changes in atmospheric transparency during 
the several hours per day required. If the sky clears as the sun 
mounts higher, the solar-constant value is too high, and vice versa. 
But in the average of many days of highest apparent excellence, 
atmospheric changes were largely eliminated. We believe that our 
mean value determined during this period, 1.94 calories per square 
centimeter per minute, will never be greatly corrected. 

THE SHORT METHOD OF SOLAR-CONSTANT DETERMINATION 

In 1919 we devised a new and briefer method, less affected by 
atmospheric changes though dependent on the long method for 
indispensible data of average atmospheric transmission. If the sky 
is hazy and therefore bright, the atmospheric transparency is low. 
We found it iDOSsible to express empirically the observed atmospheric 
transmission coefficients at our 40 wave lengths as functions of the 
brightness of the sky near the sun. This brightness we measure 
with an instrument called the pyranometer, which we invented. We 
have so far perfected this short method of solar-constant measure- 
ment that five independent values of the solar constant can be 
observed and computed by two observers in five hours of work. We 
still use the fundamental long method of Langley occasionally, but 
only as a check to assure us that the empirical short method is still 
sound. 

Soon after the Mount Wilson Observatory was founded by that 
great scientific organizer. Dr. George E. Hale, he invited Doctor 
Langley to conduct solar-constant work there. We carried on solar- 
constant measurements at Mount Wilson each summer and autumn 
from 1905 to 1920. By simultaneous measurements at Washington 
and Mount Wilson and again at Mount Wilson and Mount Whitney, 
we proved that the fundamental method of Langley yields equal 
results whether carried on at sea level, at 1,700 meters, or 4,400 meters 
of elevation. 

THE BALLOON PYRHELIOMETER 

About 1914 we constructed a form of automatic pyrhcliometer 
which could be attached to a group of sounding balloons and used to 
record the total intensity of the solar beam at very much higher 
elevations. In July, 1914, my colleague, L. B. Aldrich, assisted by 
by the United States Weather Bureau, sent up one of these balloon 
pyrheliometers from Omaha. It was recovered uninjured in Iowa,

before and after the ascent, under the same conditions of temperature 
and pressure which it encountered during the flight. Correcting 
results to mean solar distance, this instrument recorded a solar in- 
tensity of 1.84 calories at the elevation of 22,000 meters. The baro- 
metric pressure there was 3 centimeters, so that twenty-four twenty-

fifths of the atmosiDhere had been left behind. Allowing for the 
probable atmospheric absorption and scattering still remaining, the 
result for the solar constant is 1.87 calories, which, within the error of 
the determination, is certainly a good check on our adopted mean 
value of the solar constant, 1.94 calories. 



DISTKTI'.UTION OF RADIATION OVER THE SOLAR DISK 

Mount Wilson observations seemed to confirm our impression that 
the solar radiation is variable. Doctor Langley, therefore, suggested 
that we make dailv observations of the distribution of brightness 



186 AXNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

aloiiii' the solar diaiiicler. For it seemed probable that if tliere are 
changes in the intensity of sohir radiation, there must be associated 
changes in the distribution of brightness along the diameter of the 
solar disk. 

We first conducted these measurements with a horizontal telescope 
of 140 feet focus at Washington in 190T. In 1913 we equipped a 
tower telescope of 60 feet focus at Mount Wilson. From 1913 to 1920 
Ave made drifts across the sun's disk in several wave lengths of radia- 
tion on every day on which we conducted solar-constant observa- 
tions. In this way we discovered indications of slight alterations in 
the brightness distribution along the solar diameter. These changes

-i 






Figure 9. — Distribution of energy of radiation along diameter of solar disk 

seemed to be associated with the observed variations of the solar 
constant. Thus in 1907 and in 1914, j-ears of numerous sunspots and 
high solar radiation, there was greater contrast between the center 
and edge of the solar disk than in 1913, a year of minimum sun spots 
and low solar-constant values. The observed change of contrast was 
greater for shorter wave lengths. Our determination of the distri- 
bution of radiation over the sun's disk has been used in England, 
Europe, and Japan as a check on which to test solar theories. 

SOI.AR VARIATION AND THE WEATHER 

In the year 1917, H. H. Clayton, then chief forecaster of Argentina, 
wrote that he had found relations between our observed variation of 
the sun and the weather of the world. He employed averages of 
many Mount Wilson solar-constant values in his studies, thus largely- 
eliminating atmospheric errors. We were so keenly impressed by 
Clayton's results that we undertook to maintain daily solar-constant 
work throughout the year. At the recommendation of Dr. Walter 
Knoche, then in charge of the Chilean weather service, we located a 
new solar-constant station at Calama, in the Atacama desert of 
northern Chile. Later by the generous aid of John A. Roebling, we 
i^moved this station to Mount Montezuma, at 9,000 feet elevation.

$55,000 to enable me to find, equip, and operate a solar-constant sta- 
tion in the best locality of the Eastern Hemisphere. After journey- 
ing to Algeria, Egypt, and Baluchi- 
stan, I chose Mount Brukkaros, in 
South West Africa, at 5,200 feet ele- 
vation. I am sorry to report that 
neither Table Mountain nor ISIount 
Brukkaros equals Montezuma in 
favorable qualifications for the solar- 
constant work. At present, m}' col- 
league, A. F. Moore, is testing 
other high mountains in South West 
Africa and the Cape Verde Islands, 
hoping to find a site as good as 
Montezuma. 

I have collected in Volume V of 
the Annals of the Astrophysical 
Observatory, recently issued, the 
results of 10 years of solar-constant 
work at several stations.

Monthly mean values from the 
Avidely separated stations agree ex- 
cellently and unite to determine the 
principal trends of variation of the 
solar radiation with adequate accur- 
acy and certainty. As the probable 
error of the general mean curve is 
less than 0.1 per cent, we may feel 
much confidence in solar changes as 
small as one-fourth of 1 per cent 
when indicated by monthly mean 
values from three stations. The 
maximum range of variation of the 
general mean of the monthly mean 
values of the solar constant since 
1920 is 2.8 per cent, and only 1.2 per 
cent since 1926. The variations of 
individual days may be considerably 
wider, so that the extreme range of 
solar variation since 1920 appeal's to 
be about 4 per cent.

PERIODICITIES IN SOLAR VARIATION 

Although the monthly mean variations are apparently irregular, 
they may be expressed with high correlation as the sum of 5 regular 
periodicities of 68, 45, 25, 11, and 8 months' interval, respectively. 
This is the more interesting because 68 and 45 months are respec- 
tively the half and third of the sun-spot period of lll^ years.

Figure 13. — Spurious 12-montli and real 11-month period in solar-constant observa-

Periodicity of approximately 25 months' interval in former centuries 
has been found by Dr. A. E. Douglass in the growth of trees, and by 
Dr. Ernst Antevs in the retreat of glaciers. Professor Marvin has 
claimed that our solar-constant results were affected by a 12-month 
periodicity, probably terrestrial. Figure 13 shows that he is in error 
and has mistaken the 11-month periodicity for 12 months owing to 
having founded his conclusion on insufficient data.

consecutive means of the observed departures from normal of the

sentations of these temperature departures as the sum of periodicities 
of 68, 45, 25, 11, and 8 months, which T think we may now attribute 
to solar variation. However, in addition to these five periodicities,

E, F, G, H, I, periodicities of 68, 45. 25, 18, and 11 months in the temperature of 
Williston, N. Dak. D, their summation, and C the departures from normal temper- 
ature, hoth smoothed by 5-month consecutive means. B and A, similar smoothed 
curves for Washington temperature departures. 

I found it necessary to include for both stations an important 
periodicity of 18 months' interval which therefore seems to be a 
wide-ranging terrestrial contribution. At Williston, in addition to 
all these, I found inconspicuous periodicities of 5, 3.6, and 3 months. 
It seems to me very interesting to trace the similarities and the dis- 
similarities of march of the curves A and C, wherein long-continued 
pronounced departures from the mean temperatures stand out so 
conspicuously.

DAILY MARCH OF SOLAR VARIATION 

As regards the daily variation of the solar radiation, our results 
are less satisfactory. Many days are wholly lacking from the 
record, owing to unfavorable weather conditions, and many others 
are unsatisfactory. The three widely separated observing stations 
show a similarity, it is true, in their record of the daily march of 
solar variation, but are not in close enough agreement to fix it 
definitely. We have in mind, however, several improvements of 
apparatus which we hope will bring closer agreement. 

WEATHER CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH SEQUENCES OF SOLAR 

VARIATION 

The station at Montezuma is far more satisfactory than either of 
the others. I show in Figure 15 the record of its daily observations 
since 1924. Sequences of rising and falling solar-constant values, 
respectively, are indicated in the figure by full and dotted curves. 
I prefer to segregate these by months, including in a separate 
group all the sequences of a given month for the seven years 1924 
to 1930. I have computed the average march of departures of tem- 
perature and barometric pressure at Washington, and of temperature 
at Williston, associated with these instances of rising or falling 
solar radiation. These results for March, April, September, and 
October are shown in Figures 16 and 17. About 10 cases contribute 
to each mean curve shown. Full and dotted curves correspond, 
respectively, to rising and falling solar-radiation sequences. The 
several months differ in detail, but agree in this, that the march 
of weather shows opposite trends following the incidence of solar 
sequences of opposite directions. 

It is curious and interesting to note that, though concurring with 
Washington in displaying this phenomenon of opposition just de- 
scribed, Williston temperature curves generally run in opposite sense 
to those of Washington. I mean that the full curve corresponding 
with rising solar radiation being found generally above the dotted 
one for Washington, we find it generally below the dotted one for 
Williston. 

We note for both stations certain critical dates when the separation 
of the full and dotted curves reaches maxima. At Washington these 
critical dates are approximately 5, 11, and 17 days after the full 
development of the solar sequence. At Williston corresponding 
critical dates seem to occur after about 2, 7, and 13 days, respectively. 

If I am right in regarding these contrasting weather phenomena 
as really depending on rising and falling sequences of solar radia- 
tion, I must make the assumption that the solar changes produce

primary effects in certain localized centers of influence upon the 
earth. Thence the effects travel southeastward in the well-known 
manner and reach distant localities as successive impulses at later 
periods depending on the distance traversed from the several centers. 




LAG IN WEATHER RESPONSE TO SOLAR CHANGES 

The phenomena of lag in weather response to solar changes are, I 
am convinced, important. Mr. Clayton has produced evidence which 
my studies also confirm, indicating that the lag of weather effects 
caused by periodic solar variations is roughly proportional to the

length of period of the solar change. Hence, if, a,s our results indi- 
cate, the sun is a star whose radiation varies by the combination of 




several periodicities of widely differing intervals, no correspondingly 
marked weather change is to be expected to follow an especially 



SOLAR RADIATION ABBOT 197 

notable case of solar change, for the outstanding character of the 
given solar change resulted from the superposition of several peri- 
odic changes. Owing to differing lags, these periodic changes must 
induce weather changes at various later times, which are not super- 
posed, and are, therefore, inconspicuous. 

BY-PRODUCTS OF SOLAR-RADIATION WORK 

The atmospheric transmission at about 40 wave lengths has been 
determined on thousands of days at many stations, including Wash- 
ington, Bassour, Hump Mountain, Mount Harqua Hala, Mount Bruk- 
karos. Mount Wilson, Table Mountain, Mount Montezuma, and Mount 
Whitney, ranging in elevation from sea level to 4,400 meters. 

From the measured atmospheric transmission coefficients, Mr. Fowle 
has determined the number of molecules per cubic centimeter of gas 
at standard conditions. His result agrees perfectly with those 
obtained by other methods. 

Mr. Fowle has developed a spectroscopic method of estimating the 
thickness of precipitable water equivalent to the water vapor con- 
tained in the atmosphere. This quantity is computed on all days 
when solar-constant values are determined. 

Two methods of determining the quantity of atmospheric ozone 
from holographic observations of the visible spectrum have been de- 
veloped. Their results run parallel to those of Dr. G. M. B. Dobson. 

SUMMARY 

I have been dealing with the intensity of the energy of the sun's 
rays; its losses in the atmospheres of the sun and the earth; its in- 
equality over the solar disk; its distribution in wave lengths in the 
spectrum; the development of instruments and methods to measure 
these phenomena; the variability of the solar radiation; periodicities 
in solar variation; and the dependence of weather thereon. These 
wide-ranging yet closely related researches have engrossed my col- 
leagues and myself for more than a quarter of a century. They have 
yielded the following results, 

1. Improved stability and sensitiveness of the recording spectro- 
bolometer. 

2. Accurate values of the dispersion of rock salt. 

3. Mapping of about 1,500 lines and bands of solar and terrestrial 
absorption in the infra-red spectrum. 

4. Development of the silver-disk, the water-flow, and the water- 
stir pyrheliometers, which have enjoyed wide acceptance. 

5. Improvement of the fundamental process of solar-constant 
measurement. 



198 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

6. Nearly 2,000 solar-constant measurements at Washington, Bas- 
sour, Mount Wilson, and Mount Whitney from 1902 to 1920, yielding 
a mean value of 1.94 calories per square centimeter per minute, and 
proving that the sun is variable. 

T. Many determinations of the distribution of energy over the 
sun's disk for various wave lengths. 

8. Many determinations of the distribution of energy in the solar 
spectrum, yielding estimates of the effective temperature of the sun. 

9. Development of the recording balloon pryheliometer and deter- 
mination therewith of the solar radiation at 25,000 meters altitude. 

10. Development of the pyranometer, an instrument for measuring 
sky radiation. 

11. A new brief method of solar-constant determination, whereby 
five independent values per day are obtained with minimum atmos- 
pheric influence. 

12. Dail}^ observations of the variability of the sun at several 
widely separated high-altitude desert stations beginning with the 
year 1920. 

13. Determination of the march of variation of the monthly mean 
values of the solar constant of radiation for the past 12 years with 
an accuracy sufficient for all purposes. 

14. Discovery that the sun's radiation varies in five continuing 
regular periodicities. 

15. Indications that the weather is to a considerable degree gov- 
erned by solar changes and is probably predictable therefrom. 

IC. B3^-products of the research which include determinations of 
atmospheric transparency, precipitable water, and ozone content. 

With hope that the apparent connection between solar variation 
and the weather will be verified and will lead to improved methods 
of long-range forecasting, my colleagues and I are going on with 
solar-radiation studies, introducing such improvements as may help 
to establish a more exact record of the solar variation available for 
all future time.

THE COMPOSITION OF THE SUN 



By Henry Nobris Russell 
Princeton TJu'wersitu 



[Willi 4 plates] 



Once in a long time, in the history of science, a true " royal road " 
is found which leads to the solution of a problem which had previ- 
ously been unassailable. There is no better example than the dis- 
covery of the spectroscope. Seventy years ago, or a little more, 
almost nothing was known of the composition of the heavenly bodies, 
and there was no reasonable hope of knowing more. The high 
densities of the moon and the inner planets, to be sure, indicated that 
they must be solid bodies, probably similar in general constitution 
to the earth, while the much lower densities of the sun and the major 
planets indicated that their constitution was different, but this in- 
formation did not go very far. Suddenly the hopeless quest became 
a reality with Kirchhoff's discovery that a rarefied luminous gas 
gives out light of definite wave lengths, which, analyzed by the spec- 
troscope, produces a definite pattern of lines, fixed in position and 
intensity for a given source, and fully characteristic of it. Gases 
absorb the same kinds of light v\'hich they emit; hence the multitudes 
of dark lines of the solar spectrum became immediately intelligible, 
each carrying its own message about the sun's atmosphere. A dozen 
or more familiar chemical elements were then immediately identified 
in the outer parts of the sun and, shortly afterwards, in great num- 
bers of the stars. This still remains the most impressive evidence 
regarding the fundamental unity of nature. Atoms of the very same 
kinds are found in our terrestrial laboratories, in the sun, the stars, 
and in nebulae so remote that their light takes a hundred million 
years to reach us. As the investigation of spectra on earth and in 
the heavens progressed, the correlation of the two became continually 
more complete. At the present time almost all the lines of any 
strength in the spectra of the sun and the stars can be reproduced 
at will in the laboratory; and the few exceptions are yielding year

by year. The great outstanding puzzles of the nebular and auroral 
spectra yielded a few years ago, and the solar corona alone remains 
uninterpreted. 

The proof that iron (for example) is present in the sun has been 
for two generations a standard laboratory experiment — which ought, 
by the way, to be exhibited to the general public in our great science 
museums whenever the sun shines. The analysis of the sun would 
therefore appear to be a very simple matter, but, as is usual in all 
precise work, many complications arise. 

With such strong lines as those of iron the simpler " method of 
coincidences " is conclusive, and many other elements — hydrogen, 
calcium, magnesium, sodium, aluminum — can be found at once in 
the same manner. Evidently, too, in a general way, an abundant 
element will give strong lines and a rare one weak lines, so that our 
analysis can be roughly quantitative as well as qualitative. 

But if we wish to make it complete, we must record and measure 
as accurately as possible all the lines of the solar spectrum and also 
the emission lines of all the elements. 

The solar part of this great task was first adequately attempted 
by Rowland. Developing the difficult technique of constructing dif- 
fraction gratings to a point which has hardly since been equalled and 
certainly not surpassed, he obtained photographs of the spectrum 
which showed the faintest lines with a distinctness which is still the 
envy if not the despair of other workers. His great " Table of solar 
spectrum wave lengths " covers the whole range from the ultraviolet 
to the red — as far as the best plates then in existence were sensitive — 
and includes more than 20,000 lines. Within this region it is sub- 
stantially complete. The recent revision of Rowland's table, under- 
taken at Mount Wilson, has added only seven faint lines, not counting 
those which appear only in sun spots, and so fell outside his purview. 
The principal reason for the revision (apart from the practical 
one that the earlier work was out of print) was that Rowland's scale 
of wave lengths, though a great improvement on anything which pre- 
ceded it, requires correction on the average by 1 part in 28,000, and 
also by smaller fluctuati'ng amounts not exceeding one two hundred 
thousandth of the whole, but too large to be ignored in precise work. 
The corrected wave lengths are good to one or two parts in a million- 
Measures of comparable precision have been made in the laboratory 
for many, though by no means all, emission spectra. It is a danger- 
ous thing, however, merely to compare a set of laboratory wave 
lengths, however precise, with the solar tables and conclude the 
presence of an element because a number of its lines appear. Allow- 
ance must be made, of course, for the small shift to the red in the sun, 
which, on the average (though not in all details) agrees with Ein- 



COMPOSITION OP THE SUN — RUSSELL 201 

stein's prediction. Even so, the number of solar lines is so great that 
a good many coincidences will occur through mere chance. 

The Fraunhof er lines are relatively sparsely strewn in the red ; but, 
even there, if we write down a fictitious wave length, quite at random, 
there is 1 chance in 16 that it will agree within 1 part in 500,000 with 
some solar line. In the green the chance is 1 in 12, in the violet and 
ultra-violet, 1 in 9. 

In a rich spectrum, with several hundred lines, there should there- 
fore be dozens of apparent coincidences of wave length with solar 
lines, many of them to one part in a million or better, by chance 
alone. We must evidently have some test to distinguish these spur- 
ious agreements from real ones. The obvious criterion is that, if an 
element is really present, the relative strength, as well as the absolute 
position, of its lines will be correctly reproduced in the solar spectrum. 
Numerical coincidences with faint lines are meaningless unless the 
strong lines of the element are present, and coincidences even with 
strong lines are suspicious if other stronger or equally strong lines 
fail to appear. 

In this respect there are noteworthy differences between different 
elements. Iron, for example, is very richly represented in the solar 
spectrum, almost 3,300 of its lines having been identified; but it is 
also very completely represented, for practically every line that can 
be produced in arc or spark in the laboratory is to be found in the 
sun. There are, indeed, many faint iron lines whose positions can 
be accurately predicted by means of the modern theory of spectral 
structure. Many of these have been detected in the laboratory by 
long exposures, but still more appear in the sun in exactly the pre- 
dicted positions and with the expected intensities. 

Magnesium, though but 25 lines are recorded in the " Kevised Row- 
land," is almost as completely represented there as iron, for its 
spectrum is poor in lines, and every line that could be anticipated is 
present. 

Copper, however, which has a fairly rich spectrum, exhibits only 
its strongest lines in the sun, while silver reveals its presence only 
by its two strongest lines, and even these are faint. Gold does not 
appear at all, nor do mercury and bismuth. What is much more 
remarkable, there is no evidence of phosphorus or arsenic, or chlorine, 
bromine, or iodine, or of neon, argon, or their heavier homologues. 

The absence of any evidence of these familiar elements in the sun's 
atmosphere was for a long time a perplexing problem. It was al- 
ways suspected that they must really be there, but " concealed " in 
some fashion or other ; and now this conjecture is changed to a well- 
founded belief. 



202 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

The main key to the puzzle is that we can observe but a part of 
the whole spectrum of the sun or of a star. Our atmosphere, fairly 
transparent (in good weather!) for visible light and for the near 
ultra-violet, becomes suddenly opacjue between 2,900 and 3,000 Ang- 
stroms — that is, at about three-quarters of the wave length of the 
ordinary limit of visibility in the violet. For all shorter waves it 
is as opaque as a stone wall. This limitation, which cuts the astro- 
physicist off permanently from the most interestin'g region of the 
spectrum, arises from the presence of a small percentage of ozone 
at the very top of the atmosphere, far too high to hope to penetrate 
by any known means of flight. At the other end things are not so 
bad. The eye ceases to be sensitive about A8,000. Modern photo- 
graphic plates run out beyond AlO,000, with hope of future gain. 
Energy-measuring devices, such as the bolometer used with such 
success by Langley and Abbot, are free from this limitation and 
have detected solar radiation beyond AlOO,000, but they are relatively 
insensitive and record only a few of the strongest spectral lines. 
Moreover, in the infra-red the water vapor and carbon dioxide of 
the earth's atmosphere cut huge, wide bands out of the spectrum. 
We may really count ourselves fortunate that the spectral region in 
which it is easy to work is so little bedeviled by the influence of the 
earth's atmosphere, which, as my old teacher. Professor Young, used 
to say, translating literally from the French, " is the astronomer's 
black beast!" 

At present our observations of the solar spectrum are impossible 
below A2,900; accurate and complete from A3,000 to a7,300; under 
completion to AiO,000, with hope of considerable extension, and 
possible, but rough, far into the longer wave lengths. 

Now, there are some elements, such as boron, which have not a 
single spectral line in the observable range, though there are plenty 
in the farther ultra-violet and presumably some {not yet discovered) 
in the infra-red. The same could have been said for phosphorus un- 
til certain successful photographs Avere taken at the Bureau of 
Standards a month ago (December, 1931). There is evidently no 
hope of identifying such elements directly in the solar spectrum. 

For many other elements the strongest lines lie far out of reach in 
the ultra-violet. This is true for the nonmetallic elements without 
exception and for some metals — gold, mercury, cadmium, etc. The 
limitation of our observing powers puts us at a great disadvantage 
when it comes to such spectra. A large majority of the "absent" 
elements belong here. 

There are several more elements of this group which have their 
next strongest lines deep in the red, beyond the limit to which Kow- 
land could photograph. Modern plates reveal these lines (in all cases 



COMPOSITION OF THE SUN RUSSELL. 203 

faint) in the sun, and carbon, oxj^gen, nitrogen, and sulphur have 
thus been added to the list. 

The second clue to the riddle is found in the fact that the same 
element may give difl'erent spectra under different conditions. 

The importance of this was first realized by Sir Norman Lockyer 
more than 50 years ago. When a compound of a metal is volatilized 
in a Bunsen or hydrogen flame, the spectrum shows lines (usually 
only a few) characteristic of the metal, and often also bands (re- 
solved with high dispersion into a multitude of close-packed lines) 
which vary with the compound present and are evidently due to 
undecomposed molecules. At the higher temperature of the electric 
arc, many (though not all) of the bands disappear, in.dicating that 
the compounds have been dissociated by the high temperature, while 
the lines — due evidently to free atoms of the metal — become stronger 
and more numerous. Band spectra, if present, are strongest in the 
light from the relatively cool outer flame of the arc, for obvious rea- 
sons. With the condensed spark between metallic poles as source, 
new lines make their appearance, and others which are faint in the 
arc are greatly intensified or " enhanced." 

Lockyer suggested, more than 50 years ago, that the elements 
familiar to the chemist were themselves compounds which, at the 
very high temperature of the spark, were decomposed, and that the 
enhanced lines came from the products of this decomposition while 
the arc lines were from the unaltered element. He supported his 
contention by the observation that, in white stars like Sirius — which 
are undoubtedly hotter than the sun — only the enhanced lines of the 
metals appear, while in the sun both arc and enhanced lines are 
present. For silicon, he pointed out four groups of lines appearing 
in hotter and hotter stars as representing successive stages in the 
process of decomposition of the familiar element. 

Lockyer was in advance of his times; and his bold theory, though 
generally doubted at first, was essentially sound. We have now 
every reason to believe that atoms are complex structures, composed 
of electrons circulating in some fashion about a nucleus. By dis- 
turbing the atoms with sufficient violence, one after another of these 
electrons may be removed, a process called ionization. Both neutral 
and ionized atoms can emit and absorb line spectra, but the two 
are ciitirely different. Spcctroscopically, an ionized atom behaves 
like an entirely new element, and each successive ionization again 
leads to a wholly different spectrum. The arc lines belong to the 
neutral atoms, ordinary enhanced lines to atoms which have lost one 
of their electrons, and so on. Lockyer's four sets of silicon lines 
correspond to atoms possessing all their electrons, or deprived of one, 
two and three. The detailed theory of the process was first applied 



204 ANNUAL EEPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

in astrophysics by an Indian physicist, Saha, and has revolutionized 
our understanding of the subject. 

In the solar spectrum the arc lines predominate. Enhanced lines, 
though numerous, are usually inferior in strength, though by far 
the strongest lines in our whole spectrum arise from ionized calcium 
(Ca+). "Band lines" due to compounds are not conspicuous, but 
some were recognized by Rowland as due to compounds of carbon. 
Many more have since been detected, and it is probable that a great 
number of the faint lines which are as yet unidentified may turn out 
to be due to compounds whose spectra have not yet been measured 
with adequate precision for comparison. 

A decisive test of the ionization theory is found in the spectra 
of sun spots. The spots, though darker and redder than the rest of 
the sun's surface, and obviously cooler, give off light of their own. 
This exhibits a very distinctive spectrum, similar in general to that 
of the sun, but with many differences. Some lines are much weaker, 
others are stronger, and some greatly strengthened. Comparison 
with the data of the laboratory shows that the weakened lines are 
practically all enhanced lines, and the strengthened lines are lines 
of easily ionized metals, while hundreds of band lines appear in 
the spots alone. At the lower temperature of the spots new com- 
pounds form which are completely decomposed over the disk, and 
the compounds otherwise present are increased in quantity. Ioniza- 
tion diminishes, so that enhanced lines fade, and arc lines strengthen. 
The agreement with theoretical prediction persists to the minutest 
detail. For an element of difficult ionization, like silicon, the en- 
hanced lines are very much weakened, and the arc lines little, if at 
all, strengthened, while for one easy to ionize, such as strontium or 
scandium, the enhanced lines hardly change and the arc lines are 
enormously strengthened in the spot. This agrees perfectly with 
calculation, which shows that for such elements most of the atoms 
are ionized even above the spots, but the percentage of neutral atoms, 
while still small, is greatly increased there. There are three elements, 
lithium, rubidium, and indium, which appear only in the spot spectra. 
All are easy to ionize, and must be so completely ionized at the ordi- 
nary photospheric temperature that their arc lines disappear. The 
strongest lines of the ionized atoms are out of reach in the ultra- 
violet, and so we would lose them altogether from our list, were 
it not for the relative coolness of the spot. This actually happens 
for caesium, the easiest of all elements to ionize; and there are a 
good many other elements, such as barium and the rare earths, which 
reveal themselves only by their enhanced lines. 

Elements of difficult ionization are also at a disadvantage in the 
sun, but for a different reason. Not all the lines, even of a neutral 



COMPOSITION OF THE SUN KUSSELL 205 

atom, are equally easy to produce. The atom may exist in a multi- 
tude of different states, each with its own store of internal energy. 
We may picture the atom, if we will, by imagining the electrons 
revolving about the nucleus in orbits, and the different states by sup- 
posing that some of the outer orbits differ in size, shape, and incli- 
nation to one another. (This picture, though imperfect, is as good 
as the familiar one of "rays" of light.) Whatever picture (or 
mathematical formula) we adopt for the energy states, there is no 
doubt of their existence. 

An atom which changes from a state heavily loaded with energy 
to one less powerfully " excited " must release its energy, and it does 
so by giving out light. The number of vibrations per second in this 
radiation — of kilocycles, to use a word now familiar to all radio 
listeners — is exactly proportional to the amount of energj^ released. 
No one knows why — if we did, we would be a good deal nearer to 
understanding the nature of things than most of us ever hope to be — 
but the fact is again firmly established. 

Knowing this, it is possible, by a study of the spectra, to map out 
with very great accuracy the various energy states of a given atom 
and the transitions between them which cause the emission, or, when 
reversed, the absorption of a spectral line. 

The properties of these atomic states or spectroscopic terms, as 
they are also called, are governed by a complicated and precise sys- 
tem of rules, which are now fully understood. The work of Som- 
merfeld, Lande, Pauli, Hund, and others has led to a theory which 
interprets, and, what is more, predicts, the structure of even the 
most complicated spectra, and enables us to specify exactly what 
occurs when each one of the hundreds or even thousands of lines is 
emitted or absorbed. 

An atom, left to itself, will settle down into its normal state, with 
the smallest possible content of energy. From this state it may pass 
by absorption of light into any one of a number of others, producing 
certain spectral lines. Each atom is doing only one thing at a time ; 
but among the billions of atoms in the smallest perceptible quantity 
of gas, all these transitions are happening at once. Those which are 
most likely to occur give the strongest lines. 

An atom in an exited state of higher energy content absorbs a 
number of other lines, quite different from the first, and so on for 
each of the numerous exited states, till the whole complicated spec- 
trum is built up. 

Now the relative numbers of atoms in the various energy states 
depend on the temperature of the gas. In a cool gas practically 
all of them are in the normal state ; but, with rising temperature, an 
ever-increasing though usually small proportion will be found at any 
moment in each of the exited states. 



206 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

Sodium vapor, for example, when cool, absorbs only the familiar 
l)air of lines in the yellow, and others in the ultra-violet, which are 
produced by transitions from the normal state. But at a white heat, 
a minute fraction (perhaps 1 in 100,000) of the atoms are in an 
exited state and absorb other pairs of lines in the red, orange, and 
green. In the electric furnace those lines are very feebly absorbed, 
but in the far hotter atmosphere of the sun they are stronger in pro- 
portion to the great principal pair in the j^ellow. 

Similar phenomena occur in the more complicated spectra, such 
as those of titanium and iron, where there are dozens of different 
exited states. The behavior of the lines at different laboratory tem- 
peratures has been of great importance in working out the intricate 
problem of their analysis. 

Once more the sun-spot spectrum confirms the theor}^ perfectly. 
Lines absorbed by unexcited or slightly excited atoms are strength- 
ened most in the spots and those of excited neutral atoms less so. For 
elements of easy ionization the increase in the number of neutral 
atoms in the spots is so great that it swamps the loss due to dimin- 
ished excitation; but for elements harder to ionize, such as silicon 
and zinc, the reverse is the case, and the lines of high excitation 
potential are weakened in spots. 

The same principles apply to enhanced lines. As might be ex- 
pected, enhanced lines of high excitation are greatly weakened in 
spots, and often obliterated. 

By a detailed study of the behavior of lines of all these sorts it 
is possible to find both the temperature and pressure in the spots. 
Miss Moore (of Mount Wilson and Princeton) has completed a very 
successful study in which she finds that the temperature of a typical 
spot is 1,000° lower than that of the disk, the total pressure 70 per 
cent higher (since the gas is more transparent and we can see deeper), 
but the pressure due to the free electrons 40 per cent less, owing to 
the diminished ionization. The agreement of theory and observation 
is satisfactory to the finest details. 

Even at the solar temperature, 5,740°, only about 1 atom in 
20,000 should be excited to the extent measured by 5 volts (that is, 
by the energy imparted to an electron by 5 volts' potential drop). 
It is easy to understand, then, why only 46 solar lines out of nearly 
6,000 for which the energy relations are known are absorbed by 
atoms more highly excited than this. 

Almost all the metals (except gold and mercury) have arc lines 
of low excitation in the accessible part of the spectrum, so that 
they are, so to speak, on an even footing in our solar lists. Some 
of them have similar enhanced lines accessible, (as do calcium, 
scandium, titanium, and the rare earths) ; but for many others, such 



COMPOSITION OF THE SUN KUSSELL, 207 

as iron and nickel, the " ultimate " lines of low excitation are beyond 
the observable limit in the ultra-violet, and only lines of considerable 
excitation are accessible. For magnesium and aluminum the only 
accessible enhanced lines are of very high excitation and are natu- 
rally faint, while for the accessible lines of the alkali metals the 
excitation is so high as to banish all hope of finding them. 

Passing to the nonmetals — which are so hard to ionize that only 
arc lines could be expected in the sun — we find that the ultimate 
lines are in all cases hopelessly out of reach and the accessible lines 
have excitation potentials ranging from 6 volts upward. Our spec- 
troscopic tests for these elements are therefore at best perhaps a 
hundred-thousandth part as sensitive as they would be if we could 
observe the far ultra-violet, and the wonder is not that we fail to 
find so]ne of them but that we do find any. Carbon, sulphur, and 
nitrogen, though they show only faint lines, must be as abundant as 
the commoner metals. Oxygen, whose lines are stronger, must be 
still more so. But hydrogen is really amazing. Despite the very 
high excitation potential of 10.15 volts, its lines are among the 
strongest in the solar spectrum. It may be that a large allowance 
should be made for the peculiar character of its lines, which are 
exceptionally susceptible to widening by the electric fields of neigh- 
boring ions, and hence to apparent strengthening. But, even so, there 
appears to be no escape from the conclusion that hydrogen is far 
more abundant in the sun's atmosphere than any other element — 
much more so, indeed, than all the others together. 

For the elements which do not appear in the solar spectrum, the 
excitation potentials of the best available lines are in most cases 
hopelessly high. There may be some chance of finding phosphorus 
when its spectrum has been investigated in the infra-red, but this is 
all. 

An unexpected aid in our search has, however, recently appeared. 
More and more band spectra are being identified in the sun; that 
is, more species of molecules detected in the atmosphere. Most of 
these are compounds of hydrogen, oxygen, or carbon, but boron 
oxide (BO) was detected a few years ago in sun spots by Nicholson 
and Perrakis, and silicon fluoride (SiF) more recently by Richard- 
son, both in the spots and on the disk — adding two more elements to 
the list of those positively identified in the sun. The other com- 
pounds so far identified (some in spots only) are the hydrides CH, 
NH, OH, MgH, AlH, SiH, CaH, the oxides AlO, TiO, ZrO, and 
the carbon compounds CN and Co. It is possible but not certain that 
molecules of hydrogen (H^) may exist in sun spots. 

The chemist will gaze with open eyes at this list. All but the last 
are mere fragments of molecules, already partly decomposed and too 
active chemically to be isolated in ordinary temperatures. But it 



208 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

is not surprising that such partial decomposition occurs at the sun's 
temperature. It is probable that a few other more familiar mole- 
cules (notably CO and Nz) exist in the sun's atmosphere, but these 
molecules, in their normal state, absorb only in the far ultra-violet 
and can not therefore be detected. 

The hydrides are known to be rather easy to dissociate, and their 
presence in the sun is additional evidence of the great abundance of 
hydrogen. All the other compounds which have been detected con- 
tain at least one constituent which is known to be very abundant in 
the sun's atmosphere in the free state. 

Last, but not least, comes helium, which shows strong emission 
lines in the spectrum of the sun's outer atmosphere — the chromo- 
sphere — but no dark lines on the disk, except occasionally in dis- 
turbed regions near spots. The emission lines were recognized at 
solar eclipses 60 years ago, and for 20 years could not be matched 
in the laboratory, so that the name " helium " was coined to describe 
the unlaiown solar element. How it was detected in radioactive 
minerals, found to be a light inert gas — as had been suspected from 
the height to which it rises in the chromosphere — and finally dis- 
covered in natural gas in such abundance that it is used in airships, 
is one of the romances of science which can barely be mentioned here. 
It is still the outstanding puzzle of solar physics. Its visible lines 
demand very high excitation — 20 volts or more — so that it is not 
surprising that they do not show in absorption, but very remarkable 
that they appear so strongly in emission at the sun's limb. In fact, 
one line of ionized helium (A4686) with the enormous excitation po- 
tential of 48 volts appears faintly in the chromosphere; why, no 
one yet knows. 

All told, 61 of the 90 known chemical elements have so far been 
identified, positively or with some margin of doubt, in the solar 
spectrum. Of the remaining 29, 13 have lines so unfavorably placed 
that they could not well be expected to appear, while for 12 more 
the spectra have not been accurately enough measured to permit 
of a decisive test. This leaves four elements — holmium, rhenium, 
bismuth, and radium — for which the strongest lines are in accessible 
regions of the spectrum, and do not appear in the sun. These metals 
must be present only in minute proportions, if at all, in the solar 
atmosphere. Holmium is one of the rarest of the rare earths. Khen- 
ium appears to be exceedingly rare on earth, and radium, on account 
of its short life, must be rare anywhere in the universe, so that we 
could not expect to find it or any of the other strongly radioactive 
elements in perceptible amounts. 

So much for the qualitative analysis of the sun or, at least, of 
its outer layers. What can we do to make our analysis quantitative? 



COMPOSITION OF THE SUN RUSSELL 209 

Here new diiRculties beset us. We may ask, what is the total 
amount of iron vapor in the sun's atmosphere per square mile (or 
square centimeter) of its surface ? But the sun has no definite surface. 
At the top, of course, its atmosphere thins out gradually into space, 
like the earth's. But at the bottom it is not limited by a solid surface, 
or even by a cloud layer, but becomes gradually more and more hazy, 
so that we can not see down very far. This increasing opacity is 
due to the presence of free electrons and ions in the gas, as was first 
shown by my colleague Stewart, of Princeton, and later worked 
out in more detail by Milne, of Oxford. Milne's calculations indi- 
cate that the change from extremely low density to practical opacity 
takes place in a layer only about 20 miles thick, which explains the 
sharpness of the sun's limb, even as seen with the largest telescopes. 

By far the greatest part of the absorption which produces the 
Fraunhofer lines takes place in this thin reversing layer. In the 
upper part of it the atoms are few, but get in their full effect, while 
the more numerous atoms lower down are " blanketed " to an increas- 
ing degree by the general opacity of the layers above them. Milne 
has shown that the net effect of this partly obscured absorption is 
very nearly the same as we would get if the atmosphere were perfect- 
ly clear — except for the specific line absorption — down to a certain 
depth and quite opaque below this, and that we may introduce this 
imaginary surface at a level in the actual atmosphere such that the 
gas above it blocks one-third of the escaping light in the regions 
between the spectral lines. 

The amount of material above this fictitious surface is surprisingly 
small. This was first pointed out by Lockyer, who showed by 
direct comparison that a Bunsen flame an inch or so thick, charged 
with a very small proportion of sodium vapor by a bit of salt held on 
a platinum wire, absorbed the ultimate lines of the metal more 
strongly than the whole thickness of the sun's atmosphere. This 
very important conclusion was almost forgotten for 40 years, and 
revived only in our own day, with so powerful a support from 
atomic physics as to be irresistible. 

Stewart and Unsold have shown theoretically that the width of 
a dark spectral line, produced in a rarefied gas, should be propor- 
tional to the square root of the number of atoms per unit area in 
the absorbing layer (no matter what its thickness) which are active 
in producing this particular line. The strongest solar lines are 
wide enough to make measures of their contours practicable — though 
not easy — and the corresponding numbers of atoms per unit area 
" above the photosphere " can thus be deduced. For the strongest 
lines of all (the H and K lines of Ca-f, taken together) this comes 
out 2 X 10 ^° atoms per square centimeter, which equals the number 
of molecules in a layer of ordinary air one-third of an inch thick. 



210 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

For the sodium lines the calculated number is only one nine- 
hundredth as great, thus supporting Lockyer's old conclusion. 

For the thousands of fainter lines similar measures would be 
very laborious and of doubtful value, since a number of other in- 
fluences, solar and instrumental, produce a small widening of the 
lines. A recent admirable investigation of the green magnesium 
lines by Prof. H. H. Plaskett, of Harvard (and soon of Oxford), 
shows that the prediction of dark solar lines is a much more com- 
plicated aifair than is supposed in the simpler theory already 
mentioned, and that exact calculation of the number of atoms active 
in producing them is very difficult. Some other line of attack is 
to be desired, and one is opened by the modern theory of spectra. 

Most spectroscopic terms are nmltiple, with from two to seven 
components. Combinations between two such terms give rise not 
to single lines but to groups of from 2 to 19 lines, called multiplets. 
Some lines in such a group are much stronger than others, and their 
relative intensities — that is, the relative number of atoms engaged 
in their production — can be calculated from the quantum theory, 
independently of the temperature, pressure, and other conditions. 

We may now have (for example) 2 lines in the same multiplet, 
of which the stronger has the intensity 4 on Rowland's arbitrary 
scale, and the weaker intensity 1, while the formulae indicate that 
40 times as many atoms are at work on the first as on the other. 
Another pair of lines with the same Rowland intensities may give 
the theoretical ratio 25, another 50, and so on — for Rowland's esti- 
mates are rather rough. But great numbers of lines are available, 
and the average of all gives a good determination of the relative 
number of atoms which produce lines of various intensities on Row- 
land's scale. In this way Doctor Adams, Miss Moore, and the writer 
have calibrated Rowland's scale. The same difference in his inten- 
sities corresponds to a greater difference in the numbers of active 
atoms for lines in the violet than in the red ; but this can be allowed 
for. With the aid of the strong lines which have been individually 
measured, the actual number of atoms which are at work in pro- 
ducing a solar line of given intensity may be found. 

For a line of Rowland's intensity — just well visible with ordinary 
high dispersion — there are about 10" atoms at work per square cen- 
timeter, or enough to make a layer of gas, under standard conditions, 
a little over a ten-millionth of an inch thick. The faintest lines of 
all require about a twentieth as much. 

We may now find how many atoms of each element are engaged 
in producing each one of its observable lines. To find the total 
number of atoms of this element, in the solar atmosphere, we must 
allow for those which give lines in the infra-red and ultra-violet, 
which we can not observe. This can be done if we can get at all the 



COMPOSITION OF THE SUN RUSSELL 211 

important lines which are absorbed by the atom in at least one of 
its energy states (whether normal or excited), for the numbers in 
other states can then be calculated by thermodynamic theory, know- 



FiGURE 1.- — Diagram showing the energy levels of the sodium atom. The dots repre-

energy content of the atom. The lines represent those transitions which can 
actually occur and produce spectral lines. An atom in the lowest energy state 
absorbs only a certain series of spectral linos, one in the next highest energy state, 
two other series of lines. (See text.) 




Figure 2. — Similar diagram for the spectrum of titanium. The number of energy 
states is very large, and the transitions between them give a very complicated 
spectrum 

ing the sun's temperature. In this way the numbers of neutral atoms 
have been found for many elements. Most ionized atoms have all 
their best lines in the far ultra-violet and are not amenable to our 
treatment, but there are several whose numbers can be found, Now 

102992—32 15 



212 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

the pi'oportion of the atoms of any clement which are ionized 
depends not only on the temperature, but on the pressure (and also, 
of course, on the ease of ionization of the element). 

We know the proportion for half a dozen elements whose strongest 
arc and spark lines are both accessible, and so we can find the pres- 
sure — or, at least, that part of it due to the free electrons. At the 
level of the " j^hotosphere " (as defined above), this comes out 
one twenty -thousandth of the " standard atmosphere." We can now 
calculate that an element with an ionization potential of 8.5 volts 
would be half ionized and half neutral. Most of the metals are more 
easily ionized than this. Only one atom of sodium in a thousand is 
neutral, and less than one in a hundred for calcium. One-fifth of 
the iron atoms, and one-third those of silicon, are neutral; but 85 
per cent are neutral for zinc, 99.6 per cent for carbon, and all but 
one in 30,000 in the case of hydrogen. Making the appropriate 
allowances, we find the total amounts of the various elements in the 
sun's atmosphere. For the metals, the results should be fairly 
reliable. They indicate that six elements, — sodium, magnesium, 
silicon,^ potassium, calcium, and iron — furnish 95 per cent (by 
weight) of all the metallic vapors, and six more nine-tenths of the 
remainder, as is shown in Table 1.

This is very much like the order of relative abundance that is 
found on earth. The results of Clarke and Washington (based on 
hundreds of careful analyses of typical rocks) show a greater abun- 
dance of silicon, aluminum, and titanium. But these results repre- 
sent the composition of the outer 10 miles of the earth's crust, which 
is composed mainly of granitic rocks, richer in these three elements 
than are the far thicker layers of dense rocks deeper down. 

Again, nickel and cobalt are much less abundant in terrestrial rocks 
than in the sun. But in meteorites (which are probably more repre- 
sentative of the general composition of the solar system than is the 
siliceous slag, which forms the outer layers of the earth) they occur 
in nearly the same proportions as in the sun.

COMPOSITION OF THE SUN — RUSSELL, 213 

Among- the rare elements there is a general parallelism between 
solar and terrestrial abnndance. Some elements, of wliich the most 
noteworthy is scandium, appear to be much more abundant in the sun 
than here ; but small quantities of these, widelj^ disseminated among 
the rocks, may well have escaped the search of the ordinary chemist, 
even though skilled. The actual amounts even of the rare elements, 
in the sun's atmosphere, are very great. For example, platinum is 
represented only by three faint lines in the solar spectrum; but to 
produce these there must be something like 500 million tons of the 
precious metal above the photosphere. This amounts, however, to 
less than 8 ounces per square mile of surface, or one-eightieth of an 
ounce per acre. An equal amount, rained down in thin dust on the 
earth's surface, would not be worth the labor of sweeping up. 

The amounts of the nonmetallic elements are much harder to 
determine in the sun, for the onl}?- available lines come from atoms 
in highly excited states. For every atom in such a state there are a 
very great number in the normal state — sometimes millions — and 
these huge factors are hard to determine accurately. As has already 
been said, carbon, sulphur, and nitrogen must be as abundant as the 
commoner metals, oxygen more so, and h3^drogen far more abundant 
than all the rest. 

In the hotter stars, where lines of ionized oxygen, nitrogen, etc., 
and of neutral helium, are conspicuous, a better comparison can be 
made. Miss Payne, of Harvard, working a few years ago by meth- 
ods developed by Milne, derived values for the relative abundance 
of a number of elements and reached the very important conclusion 
that the stars are remarkably similar in composition. The great 
differences in their spectra arise, not from differences in the abun- 
dance of the elements, but in their ionization and excitation at dif- 
ferent temperatures. Her results, and those of the writer's later 
work, are in remarkably good agreement. 

Combining them in a final summary, we may conclude that at 
least 90 per cent of all the atoms in the sun's atmosphere — and per- 
l\aps 95 per cent or more — are atoms of hydrogen. Of the remainder, 
helium and oxygen contribute some two-thirds, and all the metals, 
together with carbon, sulphur, etc., the rest. 

These are the proportions of the various constituents by volume 
in the gas. By weight, the metals, whose atoms are much heavier, 
make up a quarter of the whole (or less, with the higher estimates 
of the abundance of hydrogen). 

Whether the sun's interior is of the same composition is a harder 
question. The great ascending cyclonic whirls which produce sun 
spots must come from a considerable depth, but from only a very 
small fraction of the way to the center. Whether the deeper layers 
are sufficiently stirred by currents to undo the very small tendency 



214 ANNUAL KEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

for the heavy atoms to settle gradually to the center is not certain, 
but it appears to be fairly probable. 

The remarkable differences in the abundance of the elements are 
as yet almost unexplained ; this is a problem for the next generation 
of physicists, and a fascinating one. It is natural to imagine that 
the many different elements have been }3roduced in some way or other, 
out of a more primitive material— perhaps out of hydrogen, which is 
the simplest, and in many ways seems fit to be the raw material for 
the rest. Abundant elements would then be those that have been 
formed in large amounts, wdiile the rare ones have either been less 
likely to form, or more likely to change over into something else. 

One general relation, first pointed out by Harkins, of Chicago, is 
conspicuous. Elements of odd atomic number are much less abundant 
than those of the adjacent even numbers. There is hardly an excep- 
tion among the 56 elements included in the study of the sun's atmos- 
phere, and on the average the even elements are eight times as 
abundant as the odd ones. 

This must have something to do with the stability of the atomic 
nuclei, but no one yet knows how. 

Another very striking case has been accounted for. Lithium and 
beryllium, the lightest elements next to hydrogen and helium, occur 
in surprisingly small amounts in the sun, less than a hundred thou- 
sandth part as much as either these lighter elements or heavier ones 
like oxygen or iron. Atkinson, of Rutgers, has accounted for this 
by a theory of the building up of atoms out of hydrogen in the 
intensely heated interior of the sun or of a star. In such a region 
the lighter atoms are stripped of all their electrons and reduced to 
bare nuclei, -which collide violently with one another. Once in a 
very long time (as atomic events go) a hydrogen nucleus, or proton, 
will hit some other nucleus so hard that it penetrates it and stays 
there, forming a new nucleus, of greater atomic weight. The wave 
mechanics indicate that the probability of such penetration is much 
greater when the charge on the nucleus is small, and hence the lith- 
ium or beryllium atoms, if originally present in large numbers inside 
a star, would get built up into heavier ones, till in the final " steady 
state " very few were left. This process of atom building liberates 
a great amount of energy, sufficient to keep the sun shining for 
thousands of millions of years. 

This theory, though beautiful and most promising, is still provi- 
sional. It is probable, however, that with increased knowledge 
regarding the composition of the stars and the sun, as well as of 
their masses, densities, and other characteristics, a great deal more 
can be found out about the past history and the evolution both of 
stars and of atoms than anj^one knows now.

SUN SPOTS AND RADIO RECEPTION^

[With 2 plates] 



Of all astronomical bodies the sim is by far of the greatest imme- 
diate concern to human beings. Literally in him we live and move 
and have our being. Every square yard of the earth's surface 
exposed to direct sunshine receives energy at the rate of more than 
one-and-a-half horsepower; the whole earth receives from the sun 
heat at such a rate that if converted into doing work it would 
represent the equivalent of 230,000,000,000,000 horsepower. With 
the exception of a few experimental solar engines once set to work 
for irrigation purposes in arid regions, man has practically made 
no attempt to convert, directly, solar rays into mechanical effort. 
Perhaps when oil is running low and coal is $100 a ton we may 
learn to tap profitably this abundant source. 

When we reflect, further, that, after all, the whole earth can 
intercept less than one-billionth of the sun's total output, we realize 
our complete inability to conceive of this stupendous and seemingly 
inexhaustible supply. To determine conditions at the surface of 
the sun and to measure its temperature, which is about 12,000° F., 
is a far simpler task than to divine the source of its enormous 
energy or to conjecture just what is going on in the interior. 

However, the sun is a typical star, and, thanks to the researches 
of Eddington at Cambridge University, we are no longer as igno- 
rant as we once were concerning the interior of the stars, and our 
best guess as to the source of their radiant energy leads us into the 
very structure of the matter of which stars are made. We may pic- 
ture the interior of the sun as a veritable hurly-burly of atoms and 
electrons, flying hither and thither at terrific velocities which rapidly 
increase as the sun's center is approached, where the temperature is 
of the order of 80,000,000°. From this hot interior of the sun 
must ultimately arise the source of solar radiation, which not only

manifests itself in familiar light and heat but in a wide variety of 
electromagnetic disturbances, whose far-reaching effects we are just 
beginning to appreciate. 

Studies during the last few years indicate that there are cosmic 
causes at work which may profoundly influence the electrical state 
of the earth's atmosphere which radio waves traverse. Probably the 
sun is the one astronomical body most responsible for changes in 
our terrestrial affairs. Every radio listener knows that daytime re- 
ception is vastly poorer than night-time reception in the broadcasting 
zone. Here is the most obvious exhibition of the effect of the sun's 
rays upon radio. On the other hand, both day and night reception 
vary greatly from time to time for what has often seemed no good 
reason at all. It is from relatively very recent researches that we 
have come to believe much of the cause for this varying degree of 

reception is to be found in 
the sun's atmosphere itself. 
When we examine the 
sun's surface through the 
telescope, we find that it 
presents a strange mottled, 
or granulated appearance. 
In this mottled surface 
there develop now and then 
dark patches, often grow- 
ing into huge black areas 
surrounded by a somewhat 
shaded region called the 
penumbra. These dark 
areas are the sun spots. Whatever may be ultimately accepted as the 
best explanation of the si)ots, one can not go far wrong in picturing 
a sun spot as a terrific storm in the sun's atmosphere, a cyclonic 
whirlwind for which the most violent tropical hurricane would be a 
microscopic illustration. 

One of the most extraordinary features of sun spots is the perio- 
dicity with which they appear on the solar surface. For nearly a cen- 
tury and a half sufficiently accurate records of the appearance of 
sun spots have been made, so that if we plot the degree of spottedness 
of the solar surface year by yeai-, we discover a periodic rise and fall 
in the stormy condition of tlie sun's surface spanning approximately 
11 years. We are now not far from Avhat we call a sun-spot maxi- 
mum. About eight years ago sun spots were very scarce, and when 
they occasionally appeared were very small and insignificant affairs. 
Curiously enough, at the beginning of a sun-spot cycle the spots 
appear on the sun's surface at relatively high latitudes and as the

cycle progresses they increase in size and number and break out at 
successively lower latitudes on the solar sphere, a given cycle of spots 
finally disappearing just a few degrees from the solar equator. 

The true character of sun spots 
as magnetic whirls in the solar 
atmosphere was first established by 
Hale, of the Mount Wilson Ob- 
servatory, in 1908.^ By means of 
the newly invented spectro-helio- 
graph, Hale was able to photo- 
graph different layers in the solar 
atmosphere and establish the ex- 
istence of vortices similar to the 
whirlwinds which are character- 
istic of cyclonic storms in the 
earth's atmosphere. Furthermore 
by analyzing with polarizing ap- 
paratus the character of the rays 
of light radiating from the sun 
spots, Hale was able to demonstrate that the light emitted from the 
center of these gigantic whirls betrayed unmistakably that they were

by Zeeman in 1896.

With the reappearance of the last sun-spot cycle it was firmly 
established that the polarity of these spots completely reverses from 
one cycle to the next.^ It has been recently suggested by a Nor- 
wegian scientist, Bjerknes * that the sun spots are the visible ends of 
a tubular vortex which may extend east and west for great distances 
below the sun's surface. A reversal in the direction of whirl in

ing to the latitudes of many major spots on the sun 

this supposed vortex would account for a reversal of the magnetic 
polarity of the sun spots with the change of cycle. 

No completely satisfactory explanation of the ultimate origin of 
these whirls has yet been made. There is one peculiarity, however, in 
the sun's behavior which doubtless has an important bearing on this 
point. While the sun rotates on its axis from west to east in common 
with the axial rotation of other bodies in the solar system, its period 
of rotation is not the same for different parts of the solar surface.

Near the Equator the sun rotates once on its axis in a period of al- 
most 241/^ days, whereas in latitude 35° the motion of the spots across 
the surface indicates that almost 261/2 days are consumed in a single 
rotation. Spectroscopic observations make it possible to determine 
the rate of rotation in regions of higher latitudes than those in which 
the spots appear. In latitude G0° the rotation period is nearly 31 
days. The continual slipping of the atmospheric layers of lower lati- 
tude past those of higher latitude must result in the formation of 
eddy currents favorable to the formation of cyclonic whirls, thus 
producing sun spots.

FiGUEE 5. — Showing reversal in the magnetic polarity of the spots with change in

The mention of sun spots invariably raises the question of a 
possible connection between the sj)ots on the sun and terrestrial phe- 
nomena. Some statisticians with an insatiable appetite for correla- 
tions have attempted to connect with sun spots almost every cycle 
in world affairs from fluctuations in the New York stock market to 
the fecundity of rabbits in northern Canada. In the popular mind 
almost every w^orld catastrophe has sooner or later been attributed 
to sun spots, from a Florida hurricane to the great World War, both 
of which, by the way, did not culminate around a sun-spot maximum. 

But, seriously, there are to the scientist certain well recognized 
phenomena on the earth which pass through cycles whose correlation 
with the sun-spot cycle is unmistakable. 



220 



ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 



For more than a century and a half records of the numbers of sun 
spots have been kept and afford data for a study of their periodicity 
over a range of about fifteen 11-year cycles. For more than a cen- 
tury records of the variation in the earth's magnetism have been 
made and preserved. The remarkable correlation of sun spots with 
magnetic changes on the earth is at once apparent when we make a 
graph of the number of sun spots and compare this with a similar 
graph for changes of the compass needle (fig. 6). Simultane- 
ously with the so-called magnetic storms, which are wont to sweep

the earth upon the appearance of great sun-spot activity, we witness 
frequent and brilliant displays of the aurora borealis. 

The auroral light is due to an electronic discharge in the upper 
and highly rarified atmosphere of the earth and is most probably 
activated by charged particles of electricity emanating from the sun, 
whose activity varies with the sun-spot cycle. It seems probable 
that the magnetic vertical whirl of sun spots acts as a directing field 
in guiding electrons escaping from the sun. When a conspicuous 
spot appears near the center of the solar disk, and is therefore ap- 
proximately in line with the earth and the sun's center, there is 



SUN SPOTS AND RADIO — STETSON 



221 



a particularly good chance of the ejected electrons striking the 
earth's atmosphere and causing an ionization, or electrification, of 
the upper atmosphere, giving rise to an auroral display. At the 
same time the induced earth currents will distort the earth's mag- 
netic field, causing the small variations in the compass needle so 
characteristic of a " magnetic storm." 

Wliile for many generations scientists have recognized the recur- 
rent cycle in solar activity and the magnetic changes in the earth, 
never before the present period of sun-spot activity has it been 
possible to study so thoroughly the changing degree of electrification 
in the earth's atmosphere with the coming and going of the spots 
across the solar disk. All this has come about by the development 
of the radio. 

The same electric disturbances which alter the earth's magnetic 
field and produce the displays of the aurorae, or northern lights, so 
change the electrical state of our atmosphere that the radio waves 
are also afi'ected to a very marked degree by the coming and going 
of the gigantic solar cyclones.

In the adjoining figure is a graph showing the number of sun 
spots during the 12 months of the year 1926 and another graph show- 
ing the average condition of radio reception over the North Atlantic 
and the South Atlantic and across the Continent. The sun-spot 
graph is made from the so-called Wolfer numbers and is plotted with 
an inverted scale, i. e., the larger the numbers the shorter the ordi- 
nate of the curve. These Wolfer numbers are based upon the 
number of spots visible on the sun's surface at a given time and to 
some extent upon their area, but do not take into account the posi- 
tion of the spot on the sun's disk. The general run of these graphs 
indicates that radio reception is distinctly impaired by an increase 
in the sun-spot numbers. 

Quantitative measurements of radio reception since 1926 seem to 
have established beyond much doubt that long-distance night recep- 
tion in the broadcast zone is in general poor when sun spots are

numerous and good when the spots are few (fig. 8). The quan- 
titative measurement of radio reception in the broadcast zone was 
begun by Dr. G. W. Pickard in his priA^ate laboratory in Newton 
Center, Mass., in February, 1926. Great credit is due to Doctor Pick- 
ard ° for his contribution in this field and his stimulus to other 
workers. In February, 1928, a duplicate set of apparatus was in- 
stalled at the astronomical laboratory at Harvard University and the 
measurements carried on there under the direction of the author. 
Simultaneous records made for a short time at both receiving sta- 
tions gave the necessary reduction factor for rendering those two

In making plans for research at the new Perkins Observatory at 
Dehiware, Ohio, it was decided to use the opportunity to further 
the present investigation by establishing an additional station in 
the middle West at one-third the distance from WBBM over which 
we were operating in Massachusetts. Another observer, Mr. Brown, 
of Pasadena, Calif., is gathering similar data from a Pacific coast 
station. The continuance of the Boston data is assured through the 
cooperation of G. W. Kenrick at the Tufts College Laboratory, 
Med ford, Mass. 

Now, every night, Sundays and holidays included, stations in Mas- 
sachusetts, in Ohio, and in California tune in on a prescribed wave 
length to study the effect of the day's solar radiation ujpon the elec- 
trical state of the earth's atmosphere.

In addition to the measurement of radio reception, the sun is pho- 
tographed at the Perkins Observatory every clear day in cooperation 
with the Yerkes, Mount Wilson, Harvard, and Naval Observatories, 
and a careful study made of the size, numbers, and location of the 
sun spots. It is believed from a preliminary study that the distance 
of the spots from the center of the disk, or the sun-earth line, is an 
important factor in the study of correlation of sun spots with radio 
reception and other electromagnetic phenomena on the earth.'' 

The radio apparatus in use at the Perkins Observatory is a super- 
heterodyne receiver especially constructed for the purpose, and feed- 
ing into a self-recording galvanometer which registers the strength 
of the carrier wave received from the broadcasting station of WBBM, 
Chicago, and WJZ, New Jersey. The apparatus is so designed that

the modulations of the carrier wave do not affect the record appreci- 
ably and the results obtained are independent of the nature of the 
program broadcasted. Realizing the importance of the investigation, 
the broadcasting station scrupulously maintains a constant energy 
output in its antenna current, and each night before the observers 
begin work the receiving set is carefully calibrated by means of a 
small local oscillator in the laboratory placed in close proximity to 
the receiving set. The output of the local oscillator necessary to 
maintain full deflection of the recorder in the receiving circuit is then 
read from the micro-ammeter in the circuit. The constant of the 
apparatus for the evening is thus determined. In this way local

sources of error, both at the broadcasting and receiving ends, are 
eliminated and the resulting measure of the variable reception from 
night to night may be attributed to the changing electrical condi- 
tions of the atmosphere through which the broadcasted wave travels 
en route to the receiving station. 

Opinions differ as to just what happens when a broadcasted wave 
travels over the earth. Some believe that an ether wave is propa- 
gated which is reflected back to earth from an ionized layer of the 
earth's atmosphere, known as the Kennelly-Heaviside layer, which 
lies some 70 kilometers above the earth's surface. Others maintain 
that the electric wave is refracted rather than reflected from such a 
layer. Whatever the mechanism, the wave appears to be turned back 
by this ionized layer of the earth's atmosphere. Any change in the.

intensity or degree of this ionization or electrification of the earth's 
upper atmosphere would have the effect of bending the ray more 
abruptly or less abruptly toward the earth and thereupon at once be 
noticed in the intensity of radio reception. The more rapid changes 
of this sort are doubtless responsible for the phenomena of fading, 
with which every radio fan is thoroughly familiar. According to our 
theory the sun constantly bombards the earth's atmosphere with 
electrons or bundles of energy of high frequency, which in turn tear 
apart the positive and negative charges of the atmospheric molecules, 
in other words, ionize it to a very considerable extent, thus producing 
the Kennelly-Heaviside layer. If the sun is more active on occasion, 
as when large spots appear on its surface, the degree of ionization 
increases, producing substantially the effect of lowering the Kennelly-

Heaviside layer and upsetting the radio reception. When the sim is 
again less active, the atmosphere tends to return to its normal state 
of ionization and the radio broadcasting reception tends to improve 
as the ionized layer lifts. 

For certain wave lengths it is possible that the effect of a rising 
and falling ionized layer may actually be the reverse of that noted 
in the broadcasting zone, giving impaired reception during less solar 
activity. Curiously enough, this is just what has been observed by 
Doctor Pickard at the Newton Center laboratory when working on 
long waves of 18-kilocycle frequency. 

Further study of the data shows a definite 14 or 15 month period in 
solar activity to be exhibited both in the matter of sun spots and in 
radio reception. 

Another important result of the study of the reception curve is 
to show how completely unfounded is the popular impression that 
radio reception is universally poor in summer and good in winter. 



226 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

Generally speaking, reception should be better in the winter months 
on account of the shortened days and decreased daylight. On the 
other hand, the sun spots and radio curves of 1926-1928 show that 
the increased solar activity gave much poorer reception in the winter 
months of both 1926 and 1927 than during the summer months of the 
same years. Conditions again improved in 1928, but reception again 
became poor in the fall and winter of 1929. It may be mentioned 
that the high degree of static due to thunderstorms in the summer 
months results in the fact that the average radio listener will decrease 
the sensitivity of his set in summer to lessen these disturbances with 
the necessary accompaniment of low audible intensity of distant sta- 
tions. Hence the general impression of a low intensity accompanying 
warm weather temperature. 

The radio reception registered in 1929 has tended to follow the 
same 15-month cycle in the sun-spot numbers with a marked depre- 
ciation during the recent fall maximum, when, under normal condi- 
tions, radio reception should have been improving with the decreasing 
hours of sunshine. 

Some progress has been made by Doctor Pickard and others in the 
correlation of the temperature changes with radio reception, and 
while concomitant variation markedly exists it is doubtful if the 
relation is one of cause and effect. It seems far more plausible that 
changes in the solar activity are more directly responsible for varia- 
tions in the signal strengths received than that such should be de- 
pendent upon any absolute values of atmospheric temperature. 

The subsequent rise in sun-spot numbers corroborated to a remark- 
able degree a prediction ventured at the New York meeting of the 
American Association for the Advancement of Science, in 1928, that 
the period of maximum for the present 11-year cycle had not been 
passed. Forcasting on the basis of the 15-month cycle, which had 
worked so effectively during the preceding years, the year 1930 was 
expected to show a general decrease in sun-spot numbers as the 
year waxed, with a corresponding increase in radio signal strength in 
the broadcast zone. By the very end of 1930 and the beginning of 
1931 the general rise of a secondary sun-spot maximum became 
evident. By 1931, however, it was believed that we should be so 
far from the maximum of the 11-year period that the secondary 
maximum period should have no such marked effect upon radio 
reception and allied electromagnetic phenomena as did the sun-spot 
maxima of 1928-29. Such has been proven to be the case by the sub- 
sequent observations. The curve of radio intensities received since 
observations have been made at the Perkins Observatory is shown in 
Figure 12, the ordinates increasing from the top toward the bottom 
of the figure. The trend of this inverted curve of radio reception 
with the curve of decreasing sun-spot numbers is self-evident. The

general lifting of the ionization level in the earth's atmosphere may 
be expected to continue with fluctuations through the next three years, 
but in 1934 solar activity should be as quiescent as at tlie last mini- 
mum in 1923. 

With the assistance of Marvin Cobb, nearly 3,000 hours of recording 
data have accumulated to date (January, 1932), which is making 
rapidly available a store of material for more extensive investigations. 

Through an analj^sis of existing data it has become possible to de- 
termine the percentage change of intensity of signal strengths as a 
function of the distance of the receiving station from the subsolar

light observations which enter into part of the records during the

some of the less obvious departures in radio reception from the ex- 
pected values which follow generally the inverse trend of sun-spot 
numbers. 

An examination of three years' radio data has revealed the appar- 
ent dependence of the intensity of reception upon the position of the

eral showing 100 per cent increase in strength at those times when

Further studies of the lunar effect are being pursued at the Perkins 
Observatory which give promise of evaluating further corrections 
to the radio curve for more direct comparison with the curve of 
sun-spot numbers. 

Perhaps the most remarkable result of our correlation study has 
been the discovery that radio apparatus has become an effective tool 
in the study of solar radiation. Furthermore, since meteorological 
changes are correlatable with changes in^ radio reception, it is but 
fair to specify that a new method has been evolved which may ulti- 
mately lead to important correlation between sun spots and the

Grateful acknowledgement is due the American Academy of Arts 
and Sciences for grants from the Rumford Fund to aid in the pur- 
chase of apparatus for this new field of research in radiation, and 
to the American Association for the Advancement of Science for 
assistance in the making of the observations and reductions. 

In conclusion, it may be said that investigations in radio trans- 
mission, together with researches in the change in the earth's mag- 
netism and electricity and the ultra-violet radiation of the sun, may 
yet prove to furnish the most definite data as to changes in the 
sun itself.

SO near that their light takes only a few years to reach us, but the 
faintest we can see are, for the most part, at distances of about 3,000 
light-years ; that is to say, they are so remote that their light has to 
travel through space for about 3,000 years before it reaches us — we 
see them by light which left them before the beginning of the Chris-

Besides this collection of individual stars, we also see a band of

This also consists of stars, but of stars which are too distant to be 
seen as individuals by our unaided eyes, although numerous enough 
to appear as a continuous cloud. Thus, the sk}^ which our unaided 
eyes disclose to us, consists of two distinct parts — a foreground, con- 
sisting of separate stars, and a background, formed by a continuous 
cloud of distant stars. No middle distance can be seen by the unaided 
eye. 

Yet telescopic observation at once discloses that a middle distance 
exists. Like the foreground and the background, it consists of 
stars — in this case, of stars which are too distant to be seen individ- 
ually without telescopic assistance, and yet are not sufficiently numer- 
ous to form a continuous cloud; for it is only in the direction of the 
Milky Way that the distant stars lie close enough together to affect 
our eyes. The telescope shows that this middle distance of stars con- 
nects the foreground of individual stars with the background which 
we can only see as a band of light, and it becomes possible to study 
the system of stars as a continuous whole. 

Such studies have shown that the system of stars is shaped like 
a disk or a coin or a cartwheel. Perhaps the last of these three com- 
parisons is the best, because it has now been found that the system 
of stars is in a state of rotation. Early investigators, Sir William 
Herschel in particular, imagined that the sun must be somewhere 
near the hub of this wheel ; we now know that it is at a great distance 
away. 

It is so far away that even the brightest stars near the hub are too 
faint to be seen by the unaided eye. The farthest stars our unaided 
eyes can see are only about 3,000 light-years away from us, while the 
hub of this great wheel of stars is probably something like 40,000 
light-years away. We still do not loiow the diameter of the wheel 
with any approach to accuracy, but it is probably something like 
200,000 light-years. Still less do we know the total number of stars 
which constitute the wheel. It is almost certainly greater than a 
hundred thousand million and may quite well be two, three, four, 
or even five times this number. 

Thus, we shall get the best picture which modern science can give 
us of our system of stars if we think of it as shaped like a cartwheel, 



AN EVOLVING UNIVERSE JEANS 231 

with the Sim perhaps a third or a halfway along one of the spokes, 
and rotating like a cart wheel. The Milky Way is formed of all the 
stars which are at great distances from the sun, including of course 
the great number which are near the rim of the wheel. 

The wheel is held together by the gravitational attractions of the 
different stars of which it is composed. As a con£ec|uence, the outer- 
most stars move with the slowest speeds and take longest to perform 
a complete revolution — just as in the solar system the outermost 
planets move most slowly and take the longest time to describe their 
orbits round the sun. So far as is at present known, the sun moves 
at about 200 miles per second, and requires something over 200,000,000 
years to perform a complete revolution. 

In the early days of astronomy our galactic system was thought to 
be the only system of stars in the slvy, but we now^ know that it is 
only one of innumerable systems. If you look to the north of the 
star Beta, in the constellation of Andromeda, you will, if 3^our eye- 
sight is good, see a faint hazy patch. This is the object known as the 
Great Nebula in Andromeda. It looks at first like diffused star- 
light, as though a bit of the Milky Way had broken away — the 
astronomer Marius described it as looking like candlelight seen 
through a horn, while Herschel described it and similar objects as 
" shining fluid." 

When this patch of light is viewed through a powerful telescope, 
a certain amount of detail begins to appear; we can see dark lanes 
across the background of light and notice a certain regularity in the 
form and structure of the object. But to study it properly we must 
photograph it with an exposure of man}^ hours. Endless new detail 
now appears. The Nebula is found to be far larger than can be 
seen either by the unaided eye or by direct vision through a telescope; 
it is found to cover about 20 times as much sky as the full moon. 
The only part we can see with the unaided eye is a comparatively 
bright central mass, wdiich is fuzzy in appearance and ill defined in 
outline. Round this is a detailed structure which lies hidden until 
it is photographed with a very long exposure. 

Just as Galileo's telescope broke up the Milky Way into separate 
points of light which he at once identified as stars, so the modern 
high-power telescope breaks up the outermost regions of this Nebula 
into separate points of light. We know that these, too, are stars. 
Many of them do not shine with a steady light, but fluctuate in a 
very characteristic and quite unmistakable way with which we are 
very familiar, because many stars of our own system do precisely the 
same. Indeed stars of this type are so peculiar, so uniform in their 
behavior, and so similar to one another that we can estimate the dis- 
tance of the Nebula from the apparent faintness of these stars. 



232 ANNUAL. REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

Doctor Hubble, of the Carnegie Institution Observatory at Mount 
Wilson, has found it to be at such a distance that its light takes about 
800,000 years to reach us. 

There is no longer any room for reasonable doubt that, in its outer 
parts at least, this great Nebula in Andromeda is formed of a system 
of stars which is similar in its essential nature to our own system. 
It is not the only such system in the sky ; millions of others can be 
observed. 

Although these are of varied shapes and constitutions, it is found 
that the greater number of them can be arranged in a single sequence. 
At one end of the sequence are Nebulae consisting solely of round 
fuzzy masses, in which no stars are visible even in the most powerful 
telescope, while at the other extreme end we have clouds of stars 
such as our own system. Half way along the sequence are Nebulae, 
such as the great Nebula in Andromeda, which consist of a central 
fuzzy mass surrounded by stars, in which both the fuzzy mass and the 
stars are present, the former occupying the central and the latter the 
outer regions. 

Like our own system of stars, these nebulae are generally flat in 
shape. The comparison of the cart wheel remains quite a good one, 
partly because many of these nebulae are known to be rotating and 
all are believed to be so ; partly also because they often are found to 
have a thick central projection, corresponding to the hub of the 
wheel, while the rest of their structure is flat. The Great Nebula 
in Andromeda is of this cart-wheel shape, but it is rather disguised 
because we are neither looking at it full on nor edgewise on. If we 
could look at it full on, it would appear nearly circular in shape ; if 
we could look at it edgewise on, it would appear rather more than 
a bright line of light; indeed it would probably look very much like 
the nebulae. N. G. C. 891, which is seen edge-on. From the angle 
at which we actually view it, it appears elliptical in shape. 

We know all this because the various nebulae in the sky are, of 
course, seen at possible angles, so that we can study their structure 
as 3-dimensional solids. AVhen we do this, we find that the sequence 
I have already described starts with perfectly globular nebulae and 
ends up with quite flat nebulae. The sequence is one of nebulae 
arranged in order of flatness. 

It is easy to obtain a theoretical interpretation of this sequence. 
We know how an increase in the speed of rotation of a body is accom- 
panied by a flattening of its shape. Our own earth, which is rotat- 
ing slowly, is only slightly flattened, so that we describe it as orange- 
shaped. Jupiter rotates much more rapily (once every 10 hours), 
and as a result is much flatter in shape. Finally, astronomical bodies 
which are rotating very rapidly may be almost completely flat. 



AN" EVOLVING UNIVERSE — JEANS 233 

It is natural, then, to interpret our sequence of nebulae as one of 
bodies which are rotating at different speeds. And as we know that 
the speed of rotation of a body increases as it shrinks, we may rea- 
sonably conjecture that this sequence of nebulae corresponds to dif- 
ferent stages of development. At the one end, we have the globular 
fuzzy mass of gas with little or no rotation; at the other end, we 
have the flat cart-wheel shape in which rotation predominates and 
governs the structure of the whole mass. A satisfactory confirma- 
tion of this is to be found in the fact that a number of these flat 
nebulae have been observed to be in a state of rapid rotation. 

Now before Doctor Hubble had arranged the nebulae in sequence 
in the way I have described, I had tried to work out, as a problem of 
abstract mathematics, the sequence of configurations which a mass 
of rotating gas would assume as it cooled and shrank and, as a con- 
sequence, increased its speed of rotation. I arrived at a sequence 
of shapes which agreed almost exactly with that which Doctor Hub- 
ble subsequently found when he arranged the observed nebulae in 
sequence guided solely by the facts of observation, and deliberately 
putting theoretical considerations out of his mind. This leaves little 
room for doubt that the nebulae we see in the sky are members of 
this theoretical sequence, that they began as rotating masses of gas, 
and that we see them in various stages of development. 

If a rotating mass consists of water or some entirely incompressi- 
ble substance, an increase in the speed of its rotation merely in- 
creases its flatness. But compressibility of substance, such as comes 
into play with a gaseous nebula, introduces new features in addition 
to flattening. 

At first the spinning mass simpl}^ flattens and assumes the shape 
of an orange. After a time a new feature appears — a pronounced 
bulge all round its equator. Finally this becomes so marked that 
the equator is merely a sharp edge; the rotating mass has assumed 
the shape of a double-convex lens as in N. G. C. 3115. 

This configuration forms a noteworthy landmark in the evolu- 
tionary path of a nebula. Until it is reached, the effects of shrink- 
age can be adjusted, and are adjusted, by a mere change of shape — in 
spite of its reduced size, the rotating mass carries the same angular 
momentum as before by the simple expedient of rotating more rap- 
idly and bulging out its equator. But we find that this is no longer 
possible when once this landmark has been passed. 

Further shrinkage now involves an actual break-up of the nebula. 
This can no longer carry all its angular momentum as a single body ; 
it is in the state of a fly-wheel which is rotating too fast for safety, 
and it relieves the situation by the ejection of matter from its equa- 
tor. This brings us to the type of configuration shown in N. G. C. 
5866, 4594, and 891. 



234 ANNUAL, REPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

We have so far spoken of the nebular equator as being of circular 
shape, as it undoubtedly would be if the nebula were alone by itself 
in space. But an actual bursting flywheel, of course, first breaks at 
its weakest point ; if it were of absolutely uniform strength it would 
begin to break at all points of its circumference at once. In the same 
way, if the equator of the nebula were a perfect circle, and if the 
substance of the nebula were disposed symmetrically around its axis 
of rotation, the ejection of matter would necessarily start from all 
points of the equator simultaneously; there could be no conceivable 
reason why it should start at one point rather than any other. 

In nature we do not expect to find perfect balances of this kind ; if 
the main factors are of exactly equal weight, some quite minor fac- 
tor invariably intervenes to turn the balance in one direction or an- 
other. In the present problem there could be no choice as between 
one point of the equator and another if the various minor factors 
were absent, but as soon as minor factors come into play, a discrimi- 
nation at once takes place. 

We have so far spoken of the rotating nebula as though it were 
alone in space. Yet it must have neighbors, and these will raise tides 
Qii its surface, just as the sun and moon raise tides on the surface of 
the rotating earth. Wherever the neighbors are, there will always be 
two points of high tide antipodally opposite to one another and two 
points of low tide intermediate between the two points of high tide. 
The equator will not be strictly circular, but slightly elliptical. 

It is in all probability this tidal pull that determines the choice of 
points for the ejection of matter. Matter will be ejected at the points 
at which the gravitational pull of the nebula is weakest, and so at 
the two ends of the longest diameter in the equator of the nebula. 
After the nebula has passed its critical landmark, it ought still to 
retain the lenticular figure which formed the landmark, but with the 
additional feature of matter streaming out from two antipodal points 
on its equator. 

This is exactly what we see in the types of nebulae which we de- 
scribe as " spiral." In N. G. C. 5866 we see a nebula in which the 
ejection of matter is probably just beginning; we notice the bulge 
along the equator and a dark band which probably represents ejected 
matter which is alreadj^ cooling. A more advanced state of develop- 
ment is shown in N. G. C. 4594; and a still later one in N. G. C. 891 
in which the ejected matter already dwarfs the central nucleus in 
size, although probably not in total mass. 

These are all photographs of nebulae seen very approximately 
edge-on. The well-known " whirlpool " in Canes Venatici (M. 51) is 
a spiral nebula which may be very similar physically to that shown 
in N. G. C. 891, but is seen face-on ; we are looking along its axis of 
rotation. Again, the central nucleus occupies only a small part of 



AN EVOLVING UNIVERSE JEANS 235 

the picture. In two other spiral nebulae, M. 81 and M. 101, the evolu- 
tion has proceeded still further, so much so that in the last of these 
there is very little nucleus left, and by far the greater part of what 
we see is what we believe to be ejected matter forming the spiral 
arms. In these last nebulae, we can see that the spiral arms proceed 
from two antipodal points, exactly as required by dynamical theory. 

Yet this does not quite end the story, since the arms spread further 
into space than we should expect if rotation alone were responsible 
for their spreading. There must be other factors at work, and these 
we do not yet understand ; the s^^iral formation of the nebular arms 
remains a mystery. It seems possible that the theory of relativity 
may ex]Dlain it all to us in time, but it has not done so yet. 

Gas set free out of an ordinary nozzle into a vacuum would immedi- 
ately spread into the whole of the space accessible to it. Why then does 
not the jet of gas shot oflF from the equator of the nebula do the same? 

The explanation is to be found in the gigantic scale on which this 
latter process takes place. As we increase the scale of the phenom- 
enon, the mutual gravitational attraction of the particles of gas be- 
comes of ever greater importance until finally, when we come to very 
large-scale phenomena (but before nebular dimensions are reached), 
gravitation overcomes the expansive influence of gas pressure and 
holds the jet together as a compact stream. 

But dynamical theory predicts that when this happens, a further 
phenomenon ought also to appear. The influence of gas-pressure is 
in the direction of keeping the density spread out uniformly along 
the filament, while that of gravitation is towards making the stream 
condense into compact globules. When nebular dimensions are 
reached the latter tendency prevails, so that the jet of ejected matter 
breaks up into drops, much as a jet of water issuing from a nozzle 
does, although for a very different physical reason. In the photo- 
graphs reproduced of N. G. C. 891, M. 51, M. 101, and M. 81 we can 
trace this process going on. 

The nebula shown in N. G. C. 891 exhibits a lumpy or granulated 
appearance in its outer regions. In M. 51 this takes the form of 
pronounced condensations, and in the outer regions of M. 101 and 
M. 81 these condensations have further developed into detached and 
almost starlike points of light; indeed many of these are known to 
be stars or groups of stars. 

Dynamical theory not only predicts that these globules of gas must 
form, but can also predict their sizes and masses. The calculation 
of the masses leads to an extremely interesting and significant result ; 
the calculated mass of a single condensation proves to be approxi- 
mately equal to the mass of the average star. 

This provides an excellent confirmation of our theory, and gives. 
I believe, the key to the evolutionary process we have been consider- 
ing—we have been watching the creation of the stars. 



236 AKNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

In N. G. C. 3115 we saw the raw material of the process — a gaseous 
mass of extreme tenuity, already molded, as a result of shrinkage and 
consequent increase of rotation, to the stage at which disintegration 
is about to commence. Further shrinkage takes place, and in N. G. C. 
5866 and 4594 we see the ejection of the jets of matter from which 
the future stars will in due course be made. In N. G. C. 891 and 
M. 51 individual stars are beginning to form, although at present 
only as vague condensations in what is still a continuous nebula 
mass. Finally, each condensation forms a separate star, until the 
whole nebula is transformed into a star cloud. Thus the great 
nebulae prove to be the birth places of the stars. 

Long before this complete evolutionary sequence was known, I 
had taken a preliminary step in the reverse direction, and had shown 
that the stars had in all probability been born out of a uniform mass 
of tenuous gas by a process which I designated " gravitational in- 
stability." If all the matter of our own system of stars were uni- 
formly sjDread throughout the space occupied by the system, it would 
form a gas of density about 10"-^. 

I showed that such a medium would be unstable, and that its in- 
stability would cause it to break up into condensations whose dis- 
tances apart could be calculated mathematically, which calculation 
showed that these distances would be about equal to the actual aver- 
age distance of the stars. Thus the single supposition that the stars 
had been born out of a uniformly spread mass of gas was found to 
explain at a single stroke why the stars all have approximately the 
same mass, and why these masses are what they are. 

A similar situation has recently arisen with respect to the nebulae. 
In a telescope they appear to differ widely in shape, size, and bright- 
ness. But Doctor Hubble has shown that differences in size and 
brightness between nebulae of the same shape are almost entirely 
due to a distance effect. If all the nebulae were put in a row at the 
same distance from us, nebulae of the same shape would be found 
to have approximately the same dimensions and luminosity, while 
even nebulae of different shapes would exhibit only comparatively 
small ranges of dimensions and luminosity, especially the latter. 

Because of this, it is possible to estimate the distances of all nebu- 
lae, even the very faintest, with fair accuracy; their faintness gives 
a measure of their distance. The faintest which can be observed 
photographically in the 100-inch telescope prove to be at the amaz- 
ing distance of about 140,000,000 light-years. Some 2,000,000 nebu- 
lae lie within this distance. 

Doctor Hubble finds that these are fairly uniformly spaced at an 
average distance of about 1,800,000 light-years apart. To construct 
a model, we may take 300 tons of apples and space them at about 10 
yards part, thus filling a sphere of about a mile diameter. This 



ANT EVOLVING UNIVEESE JEANS 237 

sphere is the range of vision of the 100-inch telescope ; each apple is 
a nebula containing matter enough for the creation of several thou- 
sand million stars like our sun; and each atom in each apple is the 
size of a solar system with a diameter equal to or slightly larger than 
that of the earth's orbit. 

Thus the arrangement of the nebulae in space reproduces on an 
incomparably grander scale the uniform spacing of the stars in our 
galactic system. It is natural to inquire whether the uniform ar- 
rangement of these larger masses can not again be explained by the 
supposition that the nebulae themselves came to birth as condensa- 
tions produced b}'^ the gravitational instability of an earlier and even 
more tenuous mass of uniform gas. The test of the conjecture is, of 
course, by numerical calculation. 

The masses of two nebulae are known with fair accuracy; one has 
3,500 million times the weight of the sun, the other 2,000 million 
times. If all the nebulae have masses of about this magnitude, the 
average density with which matter is spread in space must be some- 
thing like one gramme to 10'° cubic cms. The theoretical form- 
ulae show that instability would cause such a medium to form into 
condensations which would be at approximately equal distances apart, 
and that these distances would be of the order of hundreds of thou- 
sands of light-years. While the calculated distance comes out rather 
less than Doctor Hubble's observed distance of 1,800,000 light-years, 
yet it is near enough to it to make our conjecture seem reasonably 
probable. 

These nebulae provide one of the great puzzles of astronomy. The 
theory of relativit}^ suggests that the whole universe may be expand- 
ing, and recent astronomical observations, made mainly at Mount 
AVilson, have suggested that it is actually doing so, and this in no 
half-hearted way. If we may take the observations at their face 
value, the nebulae are even now rushing away from one another at 
almost incredible speeds. The last nebula which Mr. Humason in- 
vestigated at Mount Wilson, at an estimated distance of about 105 
million light-years, appears to be receding from the earth at the rate 
of 19,700 kms a second — about 12,300 miles a second ! [Still more 
recently, nebulae at an estimated distance of 135 million light-years 
appear to be receding at about 15,000 miles a second.] 

Some astronomers doubt whether these apparent recessions of the 
distant nebulae represent real motions in space or not. If they do, 
space must have expanded quite substantially since the nebulae first 
condensed out of the primeval gas. 

The mathematical work of Lemaitre and others has suggested 
that the mere condensing of the primeval gas into nebulae in the way 
just explained, would of itself suffice to cause space to start expand- 
ing. Before the expansion started there would be approximately the 



238 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

same amount of matter in the universe as now, but it would be packed 
into a smaller space; the density of the primeval gas would be 
greater than we have calculated for it. Consequently, the distance 
apart of the condensations which ultimately formed nebulae would 
be less than we have calculated. After they had formed, their 
rushing apart would increase their distances, with the result that 
by now these distances would be nearly, but not quite, as far apart 
as those given by a calculation which ignores the expansion of the 
universe entirely. 

The upshot of the whole matter is that, whether the universe is 
expanding or not, the actual condensations of a primeval gas ought 
to represent the present nebulae fairly well. 

If this account of the origin of the nebulae is accepted, it becomes 
possible to trace out the mechanical evolution of the universe from its 
origin as a uniform gas spread throughout primeval space. We 
have in succession : 

1. A uniform tenous gas of density of the order of 10"^° and 
of diameter at least thousands of millions of light-years. 

2. Condensations developing in this gas at points hundreds of 
thousands, or perhaps millions, of light-years apart, and forming 
separate nebulae with masses of the order of thousands of millions 
of suns. 

3. Condensations developing in turn in the arms of these nebulae, 
and forming stars with masses about equal to that of our sun. 

Further, according to the " Tidal theory " of the origin of the solar 
system, we may add to this: 

4. Condensations developing in the arms of gas pulled out from 
the stars by the tidal action of other passing stars, and forming 
bodies of planetary mass. 

5. Condensations similarly developing in the arms of gas pulled out 
tidally from the planets, and forming bodies of a mass comparable 
with the satellites of the planets. 

This scheme covers five complete generations of astronomical 
bodies, having masses of the order of 10=^ 10", 10^*, lO^^, 10-^ gm., 
respectively, the birth of each generation from the preceding gener- 
ation being through the agency of what I have described as " gravi- 
tational instability." 

Owing to the repeated action of this agency, sometimes by itself, 
but more often in conjunction with other agencies, we see the universe 
gradually evolving from a single chaotically-spread primeval gas of 
extreme tenuity, down to comparatively small dense bodies such as 
our earth which form possible abodes for life.

THE ROTATION OF THE GALAXY ^ 



By A. S. Eddington 
Plumian Professor of Astronomy in the University of Camhridge 



Early in 1718 Edmund Hallcy communicated to the Royal Society 
the paper announcing his discovery of the proper motions of the 
stars, under the title " Considerations on the Change of the Latitudes 
of some of the Principal Fixt Stars." Referring to a compariscni he 
had made of modern places of stars with the ancient observations 
collected in Ptolemy's Almagest, he wrote : 

I was suiiDrized to find the Latitudes of three of the principal Stars of Heaven 
directly to contradict the supposed greater Obliquity of the Ecliptick, which 
seems confirmed by the Latitudes of most of the rest, they being set down in 
the old Catalogue as though the Plain of the Earths Orb[it] had changed its 
Situation, among the fixt Stars, about 20' since the time of Hipparchns. . . . 
Yet the three Stars PaUlicium or the Bulls Eye, Sirius and Arcturus do con- 
tradict this rule directly. . . . What shall we say then? It is scarce credible 
that the Antients could be deceived in so plain a matter, three Observers con- 
firming each other. Again these Stars being the most conspicuous in Heaven, 
are in all probability nearest to the Earth, and if they have any particular 
Motion of their own, it is most likely to be perceived in them, which in so long 
a time as 180<) Years may shew it self by the alteration of their places, though 
if be utterly imperceptible in the space of a single Century of Years. . . . This 
Argument seems not unworthy of the Royal Society's Consideration, to whom 
T humbly offer the plain Fact as I find it, and would be glad to liave their 
opinion. 

Two hundred years have gone by, and now we are faced with a 
great accumulation of data concerning these apparent movements 
of the stars. This has been supplemented, mainly during the last 
20 years, by extensive determinations of their velocities in the line of 
sight by use of the spectroscope. We have, therefore, a mine of ma-

the motions of the stars as a system and to reach some kind of dynam-

set. According to modern views the dimensions of our galaxy are 
immense; and although our survey of stellar motions extends over

a region containing perhaps 10 to 100 million stars, this is but a small 
part of the whole. We have to take a risk in inferring the nature of 
the complete system from the small sample within reach. 

Throughout the nineteenth century astronomers working on stellar 
motions concentrated their attention on one main theme — the solar 
motion, or velocity of our sun as an individual star with respect to 
the system as a whole. For our present discussion of the system of 
the stars this has no particular interest, being merely a distorting 
factor in our outlook which is sometimes troublesome to eliminate. 
We are concerned with the stellar motions remaining after our own 
translational velocity has been allowed for; they are by no means 
those of an unorganized crowd. By later researches four leading 
peculiarities have been discovered. I give them in historical order : 

(1) Star streaming, i. e., a tendency of the stars to move to and fro 
along one particular axis in space rather than in directions at right 
angles to it. 

(2) A strong correlation between the velocity and the physical 
characteristics of the stars. For example, stars classed as of " late " 
spectral type have a higher average speed than those of " early " 
type. 

(3) Stars of exceptionally high velocity (greater than 80 km per 
sec.) are found to be moving exclusively toward one hemisphere of 
the sky. 

(4) An effect rather complicated to describe which we interpret 
as evidence of rotation of the whole system. This is the main theme 
of my lecture. 

In conjunction with these results we have to consider a matter of 
common knowledge inferred from the apparent distribution (not the 
motions) of the stars. Our stellar system has a very oblate form. 
It is believed to be almost a disk — resembling the spiral nebulae seen 
abundantly in the vast universe be3'^ond the confines of our galaxy. 

NATURE OF THE ROTATION 

The discovery of the fourth effect and the interpretation placed on 
it are due to J. H. Oort of Leiden. Among other investigators 
should be mentioned especially B. Lindblad, who had been develop- 
ing the hypothesis of galactic rotation for other reasons, and J. S. 
Plaskett, to whom we owe the most convincing evidence. 

It will help us to understand what kind of indication of rotation 
we might look for in a system of stars, if we transfer our attention 
for a moment to a phenomenon nearer home, namely Saturn's rings. 
These have a rough resemblance to the disklike form attributed to 
our galaxy. At one time there was a division of opinion as to whether 
the rings were solid structures or whether they consisted of swarms 



EOTATION OF THE GALAXY — EDDINGTON 241 

of small particles. In a famous mathematical investigation, which 
is one of the classics of celestial mechanics, Clerk Maxwell showed 
that the solid type of ring was dynamically impossible ; it would be 
unstable. The only permissible constitution was a swarm of separate 
bodies. Many years later Maxwell's theory of the ring was strikingly 
confirmed by Keeler; and it is his method of confirmation which 
especially interests us. If a solid ring rotates, its outer edges must 
necessarily travel faster than the inner edge ; on the other hand, if 
the ring is a swarm of meteoric particles, they will follow the same 
rule as the planets in the solar system, viz. the inner particles must 
travel faster in order to counterbalance the stronger gravitational pull 
of the planet. Keeler found by spectroscopic observation that the 
inner edge of Saturn's ring travels faster than the outer edge, indi- 
cating therefore that it is a swarm of particles and not a solid arch. 

In the galaxy we know that we are dealing with a swarm of par- 
ticles — stars — and not with a solid ring. Consequently, we may ex- 
pect that it will rotate after the manner of Saturn's ring, the inner 
stars traveling faster than the outer stars. This is fortunate for 
our hopes of detecting rotation. For investigating this problem we 
are dependent almost entirely on observed radial velocities. Ra- 
dial velocity means the approach or recession of other particles from 
our own particle (the sun) ; clearly radial velocity measurements 
would be unaffected by and would not detect a rotation like that 
of a solid body in which all particles preserve the same distance 
apart. It is important to bear in mind that the effect manifested by 
the radial velocities, and detected and measured by Oort, is not the 
absolute rotation but the differential rotation or Saturn's ring ef- 
fect — the increase of angular velocity as we go toward the center of 
the system. 

Figure 1 shows a portion of the galaxy rotating about a center 
situated far outside the diagram, the rotation being faster as we go 
toward the center. We must ask. How will this appear to an ob- 
server in the midst of the region? He will appreciate only the 
relative motion of the different parts of the system. In Figure 2 
we have reduced him to rest by applying to all parts of the region 
8 velocity equal and opposite to his own. 

The observer is armed with a spectroscope and measures velocities 
(relative to himself) in the line of sight. We see from Figure 2 
that there are four directions in which this line of sight velocity will 
be zero, viz., to the right and left (approximately) because there 
there is no relative motion, and up and down the page because there 
the relative motion is entirely transverse to the line of sight. But in 
diagonal directions an effect will be observed ; the stars seen in both 
directions along one diagonal are receding and those seen along the 



242 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

other diagonal are approaching. Figure 3 shows the resulting dis- 
tribution of radial motion (ignoring the transverse motion which is

not detected by the spectroscope). It will be seen that the distribu- 
tion of motion is of the kind which distorts a square into a diamond. 



ROTATION OF THE GALAXY — EDDINGTON 243 

This distortion comes from the shearing effect when the inner part 
of a ring travels faster than the outer part. 

Mathematically we can describe this distribution by saying that, 
when the stars are arranged according to galactic longitude I, their 
observed radial velocities contain a term C sin 2(Z — Zo), where U is 
the longitude of the center of the system. Moreover, it is clear that 
the effect is greater for greater distances being approximately pro- 
portional to the distance of the stars considered from the observer. 
We therefore express the term as 

Ar sin 2(? — Zq), 

where r is the distance of the stars examined, and A is a constant. 

The stars have their own individual motions superposed on the 
general rotation of the system, and we can only expect to discover 
this effect if we average out the individual motions by taking means 
for a considerable number of stars. Owing to the increase of effect 
with distance it is best to search for it in the more distant classes of 
objects. It may be said at once that the search is successful. The 
expected distribution of velocity is found in all classes of objects 
that could be expected to show it, and they agree among themselves 
both as to the magnitude of the effect and as to the direction in which 
the center of the galaxy is situated. 

OBSERVATIONAL EVIDENCE 

Through the researches of Harlow Shapley, the center of our 
galaxy had already been located in the direction of the great star 
clouds of Sagittarius — the richest part of the Milky Way. He 
deduced this from the distribution of the most distant galactic ob- 
jects observable, particularly the globular clusters, which may be 
supposed to outline the shape of the system. The exact center can 
not be found with any high accuracy, but the position generally 
adopted is in 325° galactic longitude. Oort's method of deducing 
it from the rotation effect is entirely independent ; it generally gives 
a rather higher longitude 330°-335°, but the difference is within the 
probable uncertainty of the determinations. 

As already stated, the magnitude of the effect increases with the 
distance. For stars distant 1,000 parsecs ^ it amounts to 17 km per 
sec, that is to say the stars seen at this distance in one part of the 
sky are in the mean moving toward us at 17 km per sec, whereas 
those 90° away are moving from us at the same rate. For other dis- 
tances the effect is in proportion — 81/^ km per sec. for 500 parsecs 

^1 parsec = 3.26 light-years.

distance, 34 km per sec. for 2,000 parsccs, and so on. This provides 
what may ultimately prove to be a valuable means of finding the 
mean distance of a class of objects when it is not determinable by 
older methods; for if we measure the magnitude of the rotational 
effect we can at once write down the corresponding distance. To 
illustrate this I will refer to a remarkable investigation by Plaskett 
and Pearce. 

Their research dealt with the radial velocities of about 250 stars 
of the most distant type known. They wished to sort these into 
groups according to distance; but since the stars were far beyond 
the range of ordinary methods of distance determination this separa- 
tion presented some difficulty. It is not much use to sort them accord- 
ing to apparent brightness, because brightness is a poor criterion 
of distance. The authors availed themselves of a method developed 
recently by Otto Struve. We are looking at these stars through a thin 
veil of cosmical cloud. The cloud leaves its mark on the light, pro- 
ducing certain narrow absorption lines in the spectrum of the star. 
If the absorption is intense it is a sign that we are looking at the star 
through a great thickness of cloud — that the star is very remote. By 
this criterion Plaskett and Pearce divided the stars into three groups 
showing low, medium, and high absorption, respectively, which must 
correspond presumably to small, medium, and great distance. 

In the following table the third column gives the magnitude of 
the rotation term for each of the three groups and the fourth col- 
umn gives the deduced distance (the proportion being 17 km per 
sec. per 1,000 parsecs as already stated.) It will be seen that Struve's 
criterion has been successful; or at least that Oort's and Struve's 
methods of estimating distance (both of which must be regarded as 
on trial) confirm one another.

Turn now to the fifth and sixth columns, in which the same analysis 
is applied not the stars but to the motions of the cosmical cloud. 
The velocity of the cloud can be measured in the same way as that of 
a star from the Doppler shift of the spectral lines which it absorbs ; 
but, of course, our measurement refers not to the whole cloud but 
to the particular part of the cloud responsible for the absorption 



ROTATION OF THE GALAXY — EDDINQTON 245 

If the absorption occurs uniformly in the cloud, the mean distance 
of the stretch traversed by the star's light should correspond to 
halfway. The distance of the veiling cloud should, therefore, always 
come out to be half the distance of the corresponding stars. A glance 
at the table will show how closely this is fulfilled. To speak frankly, 
I should have been better pleased to see more discordance, since 
the closeness must to some extent be put down to rather outrageous 
luck — as the authors indeed recognize. 

The transverse proper motions can be examined for differential 
rotation in like manner, but I am skeptical as to whether they add 
very much to the evidence. In treating the radial velocities we have 
gained greatly by using the most distant stars and, granting that 
sufficiently luminous stars can be found, there is no more difficulty 
in determining radial velocities at 2,000 than at 20 parsecs distance. 
But proper motions depend on measurements of arc, and what we 
gain through the magnification of the effect by distance we lose in 
the reduction from linear to angular displacement. The effect on 
the apparent angular motion is thus the same at all distances and 
remains always on the verge of what is detectable observationally. 
However, so far as the evidence goes it is favorable to the theory. 
An extensive investigation by Sir Frank Dyson gave correctly the 
center in longitude 330°, but the magnitude of the differential rota- 
tion was somewhat smaller than that deduced from the radial 
velocities. He pointed out that the analysis also indicated certain 
larger terms not explicable by rotation — a fact which seems to spoil 
the significance of the result. 

When I decided to lecture on this subject, I thought I was going 
to describe the newest of the various methods employed in our search 
for information about the stellar system. I was mistaken ; it is the 
oldest. Vixerunt fortes ante Agamemnona multi. Precisely this 
method was employed by Gylden in 1871.^ Using the proper motions 
then available he discovered the double-period term sm2{l — lo) 
and explained it just as we have done. To make the conclusion 
more convincing he made a test of the validity and efficiency of the 
method by applying it to the apparent motions of the asteroids, 
using them as a model for illustrating differential rotation as I have 
used Saturn's ring. From the motions of the asteroids he deduced 
the direction of the center of the system, viz, the sun; his error was 
about 6°. That would be one way of finding the sun again if ever 
it ceases to be visible ! Keturning to the stellar system Gylden re- 
marked that a definitive determination of the center was not at 
present practicable because the common rotational motion was pre-

246 ANNUAL REPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

sumably in the plane of the Milky Way, and proper motions for the 
part of the Milky Way in the southern hemisphere were lacking. 
He had to content himself with such indications of the center as 
could be found from analysis in the plane of the Equator. It is true 
that the direction provisionally given by Gylden for the center of 
the system is opposite to that now generally accepted; but that is 
because the double-period term fixes only the line to and from the 
center, and does not decide between the two possible antipodal posi- 
tions. He concluded: "At all events there remains an indication 
that the motions of the stars have something in common, and that 
they are not so at random as many astronomers have been inclined 
to assume." 

By these researches we find the change of velocity in going toward 
or away from the center; we do not learn the actual velocity at any 
point. A possible way of discovering this is by observing the globu- 
lar clusters which can be seen at very great distances up to and 
beyond the center of the galaxy. By their great spread they will 
have a mean motion fairly representative of the system as a whole, 
whereas our stellar observations are limited to a comparatively small 
region and give the local motion. The difference represents the mean 
speed at which the stars in our neighborhood are traveling through 
the system. The result of this determination can not at present be 
regarded as very accurate, but is sufficient to show that our orbital 
speed is large, probably between 200 and 300 km per sec. 

CONSEQUENCES OF THE ROTATION 

We have thus to recognize that for a broad cosmical survey the 
standard of rest to which we have been in the habit of referring all 
our measured velocities is an inappropriate one. We realized long 
ago that it was too crude to take the sun as standard, and we have 
referred velocities to the " mean of the stars " — meaning the stars 
which come within range of ordinary measurements. Now we have 
to recognize that this also is a very local standard affected by large 
orbital velocity, and we must apply a further correction of two or 
three hundred kilometers per second to reduce to the center of our 
galaxy. I am afraid it is too much to hope that this will be our 
final resting place; we see in outer space some hundreds of thou- 
sands of other galaxies which will claim a share in defining a uni- 
versal standard. Meanwhile the shift of our viewpoint to the center 
of the galax}'^ has produced one great improvement; it has brought 
better order into the motions of the spiral nebulae. It is the gen- 
eral rule that spiral nebulae are receding from us at very high speed ; 
the greater the distance, the higher the speed. But the rule was 
marred by two notable exceptions. As these two are the largest 



ROTATION OF THE GALAXY EDDINGTON 247 

and almost the nearest of the spiral nebulae we do not expect any 
decided recession in their case; but it was disconcerting to find that 
they were approaching us with high velocity. We now learn that 
this apparent approach is merely the reflection of our own high 
orbital speed in their direction, and when we refer their motion to 
the center of the galaxy nothing very serious remains. 

At this point we can weave into the picture another feature of 
stellar motions mentioned in the list on page 240. High velocity 
stars, i. e. stars with speeds greater than about 80 km per sec.,* always 
move towards one hemisphere of the sky. Why are there none mov- 
ing the opposite way? The direction favored by the high velocity 
stars turns out to be just the reverse of the direction of our orbital 
motion, so that when we have regard to orbital motion we must think 
of them as the extreme laggards — lagging behind the majority of the 
stars by 80 km per sec. or more. Had they been going the other way, 
they would have been an advance guard hurrying ahead of the others. 
Here lies a significant difference; stars can lag behind without any 
serious consequences, but if a star goes too fast the attraction of the 
system will fail to control it and it will escape. 

To fix ideas, let us take the orbital velocity in our neighborhood to 
be 200 km per sec. The so-called high velocity stars are lagging 
behind by 80 km per sec. or more, so that their speed about the center 
of the system is no more than 120 km per sec. Had there been anj^ 
high velocity stars in the opposite direction, i. e. gaining 80 km per 
sec, they would have had an orbital speed of 280 km per sec. or more. 
No such stars are observed, and the reason is plain. It is a well- 
known rule that for particles moving under the attraction of a mass- 
center the velocity for escape is \/2 times the velocity for a circular 
orbit ; so if 200 km per sec. is the appropriate speed to keep the aver- 
age star moving in a circle about the center of the galax}^, 200 \/2 or 
280 km per sec. is the speed which will cause it to leave the system 
altogether. The asymmetry of the high velocity stars — the fact that 
none are found moving towards one hemisphere — is an inevitable 
consequence of rotation. Such stars (if they ever existed) must have 
escaped from our system long ago. 

The magnitude of the Oort effect and the orbital speed of the 
stars in our neighborhood together determine our distance from the 
center of the galaxy. As the latter datum is at present badly deter- 
mined, I will give the result for several different adopted values. 
The mass of the system which controls the orbital motion can also 
be calculated."* 

* The velocity is referred to the local standard, viz, the mean of the stars in our 
neighborliood. 

» The calculation is on the assumption that the main part of the mass of the system Is 
concentrated near the center. If the mass is more generally diffused, the distance and 
controlling mass are somewhat reduced, but the order of magnitude is not greatly altered.

These results may be compared with estimates arrived at in an en- 
tirely independent way. The distance from the center seems to be 
of the right order of magnitude. Thus Shapley from his work on 
globular clusters located the center of the galaxy at 13,000 to 25,000 
parsecs distance. The mass also, although higher than most current 
estimates, is not unreasonably large. By extrapolating the results 
of actual counts of stars. Scares and van Rhijn obtained a total of 
30,000,000,000 stars in the galax}''. Since dark nebulae hide our 
view, more especially in the direction of the center, it is doubtful 
whether their survey comprehended the whole system, and the num- 
ber may well be greater. The average mass of a star is probably 
not more than half the mass of the sun, but there is in addition the 
mass of the cosmic cloud and of the bright and dark nebulae to be 
brought into account. 

How long does the galaxy take to make one complete revolution? 
The answer is about 250 million years. We can state the figure 
fairly definitely because it does not depend on any of the more 
doubtful estimates; the only datum needed to determine it is the 
magnitude of the Oort effect. It should, however, be added that 
since the inner parts of the galaxy rotate faster than the outer 
parts, there is no one period of revolution for the whole ; the period 
250 million 3'ears refers to the zone in which the sun lies. It is 
important to notice that the galaxy has made five or six rotations 
within geological times. The sun and earth were away on the 
far side of the center 100 million years ago — a time which geo- 
logically does not seem to be very remote. 

We may now sum up the evidence for the hj-pothesis of a rotation 
of the galaxy. An effect resembling differential rotation is observed 
in all classes of distant stars and also in the cosmic cloud pervading 
the system. These give consistent indications of the direction of the 
center and the}' agree also as to the amount of differential rotation. 
The evidence from proper motions has small weight, but for what 
it is worth it supports that derived from spectroscopic radial veloc- 
ities. The dimensions and total mass of the galactic system, inferred 
from this effect, are reasonably consistent with current estimates 
based on other data. Our large orbital velocity of 200-300 km per 
sec. is confirmed to some extent by observations of globular clusters 



KOTATION OF THE GALAXY EDDINGTON 249 

and spiral nebulae which are too remote to partake of it. Further, 
since stars with a large individual velocity additive to the general 
orbital velocity would escape from the system, we have a simple ex- 
planation of a well-known phenomenon, viz, that high velocity stars 
favor a direction now identified as that opposed to the orbital motion. 
Finally, the very oblate shape of the stellar system is strongly sug- 
gestive of rapid rotation; and in the spiral nebulae, which are be- 
lieved to be patterns of our galaxy, the rotation can be directly 
observed and measured. 

The evidence seems convincing ; nevertheless a thread of insecurity 
runs through the whole fabric. It is the old story — our conclusions 
rest mainlj^ on observations of the northern celestial hemisi^here. and 
the southern observations make a poor counterweight. This is a com- 
mon complaint in all discussions of stellar statistics; but I think 
that in none is it so serious as in the determination of galactic rota- 
tion. For this the most useful data have been piuvided by the 
Dominion Astroph3'sical Observatory (British Columbia), which by 
reason of its rather high latitude is less able than some of the other 
northern observatories to poach on the southern hemisphere. In th^ 
investigation of Plaskett and Pearce, whose results I have quoted 
(p. 244), out of 250 stars only 4 were between 193° and 343'^ galactic 
longitude; a stretch of one-third of the whole circuit was unrepre- 
sented by a single star. This is the operation which Kapteyn used 
to describe as " flying with one wing." B}'' mathematical dexterity 
the required constants of rotation have been extracted from the lop- 
sided data; but no mathematical dexterity can avert the possibility 
that the neglected part of the sky may spring an unpleasant surprise. 
As a spectator I watch the achievements of our monopterous aviators 
with keen enthusiasm; but I confess to a feeling of nervousness when 
my turn comes to depend on this mode of progression. 

THE DYNAMICAL PROBLEM 

The admission of galactic rotation must modify our earlier views 
in a way which is not always sufficiently appreciated, and I think 
that there are many who retain an incongruous mixture of the old 
with the new ideas. The distribution of the stars is far from regular 
and it has been customary to think of the galaxy as subdivided into 
a number of vaguely defined aggregations or star clouds. Particu- 
lar attention has been paid to a supposed aggregation in w'hich the 
sun is nearly central ; this is known as " the local cluster." Charlier 
attributed to it a diameter of 700 parsecs with a thickness about one- 
third as great; others have attributed greater dimensions. (It is 
sometimes hinted that investigators place the boundary of the local 
cluster suspiciously near the distance at which their observational 



250 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

data fade away.) There can be no permanent cluster of this kind if 
the hypothesis of galactic rotation is accepted. Taking the minimum 
estimate of 700 parsecs diameter, the differential rotation is such that 
the inner edge of the cluster will make eight revolutions whilst the 
outer edge makes seven. Obviouslj^ a compact cluster will be quickly 
sheared into elongated form, ultimately to be drawn out into a com- 
plete ring. It is not legitimate to reply that their mutual gravita- 
tion will help to keep the stars of the local cluster together and per- 
haps override the forces of dispersal ; for it is from these very stars 
that the observational evidence of the dispersing motion has been 
derived. That the distribution of stellar motions around us is such as 
would elongate and disperse a local cluster is an immediate observa- 
tional conclusion — independent of our interpretation of it as evi- 
dence for rotation of the galaxy. It would be contrary to observation 
to deny the existence of irregularities of distribution like star clouds, 
but I think they must be regarded as transitory eddies in a whirlpool, 
which form and dissipate continually. 

The results now before us raise an interesting dynamical problem ; 
but before entering on it, it is necessary to be clear as to our guiding 
principles. One possible aim would be to develop a theory showing 
how the present complexities of motion and distribution of the stars 
might have arisen by natural evolution from some simpler and more 
uniform initial state satisfactory to our sense of fitness ; but that is 
probably too ambitious a program at present. In most investiga- 
tions the guiding idea has been that, whatever initial formation the 
stellar system may have developed from, it has at any rate been a 
very long while about it. Consequently, if we trace back its history a 
few thousand million years we ought not to find much change. Ac- 
cordingly, the mathematical conditions of the problem are assumed 
to be that the stellar system is (approximately) in a steady state. 

It may perhaps be thought that too much of a fetish has been 
made of the " steady state " in the various mathematical theories of 
the galaxy, but that is a misconception of their aim. Although 
formally the mathematician may seem to be designing a model stellar 
system which will last for ever, that is only his way of tackling the 
design of a model which will last long enough to fulfill the obvious 
requirements of the problem. Geological time swallows up at least 
1,500 million years; we must allow a reasonable margin beyond that 
for the evolution of the solar system, say 3,000 million years alto- 
gether. The minimum requirement of our model system is that it 
will keep going for that time without collapse. Actually we are hard 
put to it to invent a galaxy with even this limited degree of per- 
manence, which shall at the same time embody the main features 
of stellar motion and distribution enumerated on page 240. As for 



EOTATION OF THE GALAXY EDDIN-GTON 251 

those who dabble in the long time scale of billions of years now 
fashionable (and I have to confess myself one of them) we must 
simply ignore them. Whatever the study of individual stars may 
bring forth in its favor, the evidence of galaxies and of systems of 
galaxies is dead against so leisurely a rate of progress. The problem 
of the galaxies is unapproachable except from the standpoint that 
the material universe is a much more evanescent affair. 

The term " steady state " is used with two distinct meanings, and 
we must further define which meaning concerns us here. Starting 
with an entirely irregular distribution of stars and stellar velocities, 
there are two stages in the approach toward ultimate equilibrium. 
The first stage is accomplished when the orbits described under the 
general attraction of the whole mass have become so distributed as 
to preserve the shape and density unaltered ; the " density of popula- 
tion " at any point then remains steady although the individuals are 
moving to and fro. This is called dynamical equilibrium. But these 
orbits are from time to time perturbed by chance approaches of the 
stars to one another, and the distribution slowly changes until a 
special form of dynamical equilibrium is reached with the additional 
property that these haphazard perturbations produce no change on 
balance. This is called statistical equilibrium. We shall see pres- 
ently that the steady state of the stellar system is that of dynamical 
equilibrium, and not the ultimate statistical equilibrium which 
belongs to a far distant future. 

The rate of approach to equilibrium, whether dynamical or statis- 
tical, may be measured by a " time of relaxation " — a time in which 
deviations from the equilibrium distribution decay to about half their 
original magnitude. For statistical equilibrium the time of relaxa- 
tion is estimated by Jeans and Charlier at 10^* to 10^" years. This 
is so great compared with even the most extreme time scale that we 
may put statistical equilibrium outside our thoughts. But the time 
of relaxation toward dynamical equilibrium is of the order 1,000 
million years. Remembering that in our part of the system individ- 
ual stars go right round their orbits in 250 million years, any irreg- 
ularity will in general be dissipated all over the system in something 
like that period. We, therefore, expect to find dynamical e(iuilibrium 
fairly complete. 

In a series of three papers in 1913-1915 I discussed the conditions 
for a steady state (dynamical equilibrium) of a system of moving 
stars, including the case of a flattened system like our galaxy, both 
with and without rotation. Re-reading these papers I do not find 
anything to modify in the mathematical investigations, except that 
later writers have found short cuts to some of the results; nor do 
Ihey seem to need much extension or adaptation to cope with the prob- 



252 AXNUAIi REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

lems that have cropped up since then. But when I turn to the efforts 
I then made to fit the theory to the observed properties of the sys- 
tem, it is like a glimpse of the middle ages. Is it possible that only 
15 years ago we thought the stellar universe was like that ! With some 
misgiving I found I must place the sun at least 500 parsecs away 
from the center of the system; but I did not expect to be believed. 
Nowadays 7,000 parsecs is the minimum estimate. I was perturbed 
to find that on the rotation theory I must ascribe to our neighbor- 
hood an orbital velocity as great as 25 km per sec; in excuse I of- 
fered a suggestion as to how the differential effects of so rapid a 
rotation might happen to be concealed. Now we admit an orbital 
velocity 10 times greater, and claim that its differential effects are 
not concealed but strikingly manifested. It almost looks as though 
with a little more courage — a little less reluctance to rend the then 
accepted fabric — the purely dynamical theory might have forecast 
the changes that have since been made as the result of observation; 
I doubt, however, if that would have been justifiable without some 
additional facts to build on. But I take warning not to be in too 
great a hurry to stretch the dynamical theory to fit even our present 
enlightened ideas. I seem to hear the voice of the Halley lecturer 
of 1945 repeating my remark, " Is it possible that only 15 years ago 
we thought the stellar universe was like that ! " 

In the past 15 years the accepted dimensions of the galaxy have 
been enlarged tenfold, and we have to start the comparison of theory 
with observation anew. There is, however, one result which seems 
to have been able to survive all vicissitudes, viz., the period of revolu- 
tion of the stars in their orbits around the center. The period 
adopted in 1914 was 300 million years, which is close enough to the 
250 million years deduced from the Oort effect. 

STAR STREAMING AND PERMANENCE 

In 1915 the main stimulus to dynamical investigation came from 
the phenomenon of star streaming — the tendency of the stars in our 
neighborhood to move to and fro along one particular line rather 
than at right angles to it. Ever since this was pointed out by Kap- 
teyn in 1905, it has been recognized as the most conspicious pecu- 
liarity of the observed proper motions. It might be a merel}'' local 
arrangement due to two independent clouds of stars meeting and 
passing through one another; on the other hand it might have a 
wider significance as part of the general law of motion of the whole 
galaxy. A suggestion was put forward by H. H. Turner that the 
line of star-streaming points to the center of the galaxy; if so, the 
motion seems to be a very natural one. He pointed out that if we 
examined in the same way the motions of the comets in the solar 
system they would show a preferential motion in the radial direction 



ROTATION OF THE GALAXY EDDINGTON 253 

towards and away from the sun. We do not see anything odd in 
this distribution of comctary orbits; equally we may anticipate a 
preferential motion of the same kind in the orbits of the stars. 

One doubt arose in connection with this suggestion which needed 
theoretical examination. If the main lines of stellar traffic all 
converge to the center of the system, will there not be a frightful 
congestion at the center? It is true that the radial roads are laid 
down as preferential only, but, allowing for the divergence of in- 
dividual stars from the general direction, there would still seem to be 
fear of a congestion in the inner part of the galaxy so great as to 
lead to trouble. Mathematical calculation has, however, dispelled 
this fear. One way of relieving congestion is to speed up the traffic 
at the spot concerned. That applies to the stellar system ; the stars 
which approach the center put on speed under the gravitational 
attraction, and by clearing out of the neighborhood as quickly as 
possible keep down the density to a tolerable value. Apparently, 
then, nothing stands in the way of adopting Turner's suggestion 

But Kapteyn and others w^ho followed him pinned their faith to a 
different theory. They believed that the line of star streaming was 
transverse to the radius; this would mean that the stars tend espe- 
cially to move in circular orbits about the center like planets, only 
(unlike the planets) they go either way round indifferently. This 
seems a very artificial disposition, and it could scarcely be regarded 
as an explanation of star streaming in the sense that Professor Turn- 
er's suggestion was. However, the first question is not which scheme 
affords the better explanation but which gives a correct representa- 
tion of the facts. Now that there is general agreement as to the di- 
rection of the center, we can answer at once; the direction of star 
streaming is radial, or nearly radial,*^ as Turner supposed. But the 
observational decision in favor of radial star streaming is recent, and 
theory had first innings in the contest Radial versus Transverse star 
streaming. 

Adopting the specification of star streaming, introduced by 
Schwarzschild, I was able to show rigorously that in a steady system 
with star streaming the preferential motion must necessarily be 
radial. Shortly afterwards J. H. Jeans showed rigorously that in a 
steady system with star streaming the preferential motion must 
necessarily be transverse.^ I doubt whether many spectators of the 
game understood how to interpret the score of " one all " which was 
the apparent result of the contest. Possibly they thought it was just 
a case of two theorists contradicting one another as usual. But 

•The most trustworthy determinations give a difference of about 10* between the line 
of star streaming and the radius ; it is difficult to decide whether the discrepancy is large 
enough to be significant. 

' Unless the system la spherical— an exception Irrelevant to the study of our own 
highly oblate galaxy. 



254 ANNUAL EEPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

actually the two investigations were complementary; the one ex- 
cluded all save radial star streaming, the other excluded all save 
transverse star streaming. Between them they established that 
neither radial nor transverse nor any other direction of star stream- 
ing is compatible with strict dynamical equilibrium. It seems to be 
clearly established by observation that radial star streaming exists; 
but Jeans's investigation indicates the price that must be paid — the 
galaxy can not be in a steady state. Nor would a transverse direction 
of star streaming have saved it; the determination of the direction 
merely decides which horn of the dilemma our galaxy shall impale 
itself on. 

Here lies the chief difficulty in pursuing dynamical theories of 
the galaxy. A perfectly steady model having been proved to be 
impossible, we must seek some compromise among the incompatible 
conditions for permanence, which will give a semipermanent model 
satisfying our minimum requirements of duration. I do not think 
that much serious progress has been made toward such an adaptation 
of the steady state theory. Oort and Lindblad have obtained certain 
theoretical relations between the intensity of star streaming (the 
prolateness of the Schwarzschild velocity-ellipsoid) and the mag- 
nitude of the differential rotation and found a rather impressive 
agreement with observation; but it may be urged in criticism that 
they have selected one out of a number of incompatible conditions for 
a steady state, and it is not at all clear why this (rather than the 
rejected conditions) should be retained in the appropriate compro- 
mise. My own impression is that it is the least essential of the 
conditions for longevity. 

ROTATION OF THE COSMIC CLOUD 

My survej'' of the dynamics of the galaxy must necessarily be 
superficial, since it would be idle to enter into details without recourse 
to mathematical formulae. I should like, however, to refer to an 
aspect of the problem which has not as yet received much attention. 
The recognition of a cosmic cloud of rarified gas extended through 
interstellar space and sharing in the rotation of the galaxy opens up 
a new field of theoretical investigation; and the djmamical equilib- 
rium of the cloud is a problem equally important with, and consider- 
abl}'' easier than, the dynamical equilibrium of the stellar configura- 
tion. 

We find that in our own neighborhood the motion of the mean of 
the stars agrees with the motion of the cosmic cloud ; the difference 
can not be put higher than 2 or 3 km per sec. Moreover, it appears 
that this agreement is not confined to our immediate neighborhood, 
but extends at least 1,000 parsecs away from us, since Plaskett's inves- 
tigation of the differential rotation of the cloud covers this range. 



ROTATION OF THE GALAXY EDDINGTON 255 

The coincidence was not unexpected so long as both were regarded as 
" at rest," but it takes on a new significance when it is understood to 
mean that both stars and cloud are moving about the center of the 
galaxy with the same orbital velocity (of order 250 km per sec). 
That they should agree to within 1 per cent is indeed surprising ; and 
I think that the explanation of this coincidence should take preced- 
ence over many of the other aims of dynamical theory. 

It seems impossible to admit any kind of interaction which would 
tend to jdrag along the stars with the cloud or the cloud with the 
stars. We have to regard them as two intermingled systems inde- 
pendent in all respects except that the controlling gravitational field 
is the same for both. If there is any community of motion it must 
be because the same causes have operated in both and not because 
one has constrained the other. At first sight a similarity seems 
plausible. We often treat the stellar system as a glorified gas with 
stars for molecules. Is it not then a case of two " gases " finding 
their own conditions for equilibrium independently? Why should 
we be surprised that they both hit on the same solution ? Neverthe- 
less, I admit that I am surprised; the reason is that the two gases 
differ enormously in viscosity. 

An atom in the cosmic cloud may in the course of its wanderings 
expect a collision with another atom about once a year ; in that time 
it traverses a path about equal to the distance of the earth from the 
sun. This is a long free path according to ordinary standards, but 
it is insignificant in the scale of the stellar universe. On the other 
hand the free path of a star is practically infinite ; it can go hundreds 
of times around its orbit from one side of the galaxy to the other 
without appreciable risk of deflection. The length of the free path 
determines the viscosity of a gas. The viscosity of the cosmic cloud 
is negligible for astronomical purposes; the viscosity of the star-gas 
is enormous. In fact the stellar universe, regarded as a gas, is the 
stickiest thing you could possibly imagine. 

The theory of a rotating nonviscous gas is familiar, and it can be 
applied directly to the cosmic cloud. We can at once derive an 
important result; the motion of the cloud must correspond almost 
exactly to that of a particle revolving in a circular orbit about the 
center. A slight deviation — if only a few km per sec. — would set 
up an enormous density gradient in the cloud, so that in one or other 
direction the stars would be embedded in a solid jam of cloud-atoms.* 

" I ought to mentlou that the tinio of relaxation toward dynamical equilibrium is ]onger 
for the cloud than for the stars owing to the lower velocity of the particles. We may say 
that the velocity of sound in the cloud (about 3 km per sec.) is less than the velocity of 
sound in the star-gas ; and accordingly the pressure-waves which level out the distribution 
of cloud matter take a longer time to travel through the galaxy than those which level 
out the distribution of stars. It is, therefore, possible that if we adopt a short-time scale 
the cosmic cloud may not yet have reached the dynamical equilibrium assumed in my 
discussion. 



256 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

There is, perhaps, a difficulty in explaining how this special distribu- 
tion of motion could have been set up originally, but at any rate it 
is the only distribution which could survive for any length of time. 
Since we find that the stars in the mean have the same motion as 
the cloud it follows that they also have the velocity corresponding to 
a circular orbit. This had been assumed by investigators of galactic 
rotation without much attempt at justification. By reference to the 
cloud we are now able to establish it firmly. 

I think it is not going too far to say that the mere existence of 
the cosmic cloud is in itself a proof of galactic rotation. What has 
kept this gas distended through the galaxy instead of collapsing long 
ago into a dense nebula at the center ? Some of the ways of evading 
collapse possible for particles with long free paths (the stars) are 
not open to a regular gas ; so that the possible answers are very lim- 
ited. The distension could be maintained by temperature; but the 
temperature of the cosmic gas (about 15,000°) is far too low. The 
only alternative is rapid rotation sufficient to counteract the pull of 
gravity. The very existence of the cosmic cloud, therefore, depends 
on rotation ; and although there is not the same theoretical necessity 
for rotation of the galaxy of stars, the observed agreement of the 
motions shows that the latter also must be rotating. 

The conception of the stellar system as a gas with stars for mole- 
cules, and its comj^arison with the genuine cosmical gas filling the 
same region and rotating in the same way, helps us to see more clearly 
the difficulty in the way of constructing a strictly permanent stellar 
system. With the cosmic cloud we have no difficulty in fulfilling 
the strict conditions of equilibrium, but that is because we neglect 
viscosity. Viscosity — the rubbing of one zone of gas on another zone 
rotating at a slightly different speed — must slowly change the dis- 
tribution of rotation. Viscosity objects to the existing differential 
rotation, and tries to set up a condition of its own. But it can never 
succeed; it can only act as spoil-sport. As soon as it effects any 
serious change the density gradients already mentioned must be set 
up — which means that the cloud falls to the center of the system or 
departs into outer space. I daresay that in the end viscosity tri- 
umphantly establishes the law of motion it is striving for — only there 
is nothing left to obey it. 

Similarly in the system of the stars we have a tug-of-war between 
the viscosity conditions and the simple pressure conditions which 
must inevitably end in the collapse or disruption of the system. The 
only question is how to arrange some kind of balance which will 
stave off this fate for a reasonable time. I have already referred to 
certain current solutions which seem to me to insist too strongly on 
the fulfilment of what we here identify as viscosity conditions, per- 



ROTATION OF THE GALAXY — EDDINGTOl?!" 257 

haps not sufficiently recognizing that by the time these conditions 
prevail there will be no galaxy left. 

Let us leave these deep waters of theoretical investigation, and for 
our last look at the galaxy use no other criticism than our common- 
sense. We have not much difficulty in imagining ourselves looking 
at it from outside, for the lelescope reveals multitudes of spiral 
nebulae, seen from every aspect, any one of which, we believe, may 
be taken as a pattern of our own galaxy. Rotating? Obviously it 
is. It is just like a Catherine wheel. Permanent? It does not look 
very permanent. Every engineering instinct we possess protests that 
such disklike arrangements of matter are precarious, and their sta- 
bility is not to be trusted. To emphasize our sense of the transitori- 
ness of things, the other galaxies are rushing away at high speed as 
though our poor system were the plague-spot of the universe. In a 
few thousand million years our neighborhood will be nearly evacu- 
ated, and our skies will have lost one of their chief telescopic glories. 
This is a rough and ready way of treating serious problems, but it 
is not out of harmony with the results thrust upon us by stricter 
methods. Perhaps the lesson of the galaxies is to wake us from our 
dream of leisured evolution through billions of years. It is hard to 
credit our stellar system with so much age and endurance. It is 
more like a young man in a hurry.

A thousand years ago the stars were looked upon as fixed points 
of light permanently attached to the sky. A few brave minds dared 
to imagine them as more than this, but without accurate measuring 
instruments there could be only speculation as to the true nature of 
points of light. At present we look upon the stars as huge aggrega- 
tions of matter, extremely hot and probably gaseous to the very 
center, held together by the mutual attraction of their separate par- 
ticles and radiating away great quantities of light and heat. Where 
the ancients saw a single star, the increasing power of our telescopes 
has shown us more and more stars, until now we know many millions 
for each of theirs. One may perhaps ask why we arc interested in 
knowing more exactly how the stars are built and what goes on below 
their surfaces. 

In the first place there is our natural curiosity. The stars appear 
to be the parents of the planets, and so of all life in the universe. We 
ourselves are, in the last analysis, made up of minute particles which 
were once probablj^ parts of a star — the sun. Millions of j^ears ago 
the outer layers of the sun were as now, a swarm of atoms, so hot that 
no two could hold together long enough to build anything more or- 
ganized than local eddy currents. We believe that suddenly another 
star, another great hot globe of gas, then swept hj. It passed close 
enough to raise great tides in the sun and even to tear loose parts of 
the sun's outer layers. The passing star kept on, but the clouds of 
atoms, torn loose from tlie sun, had to face new conditions. 

As they circulated in paths at various distances from the sun, 
they necessarily began to cool. As they cooled, their atoms began 
to hold together in groups of different kinds, and what had once 
been clouds of disorganized atoms torn from the sun slowly became

definite bodies. On one of these bodies at least, we know that an 
organization of the atoms proceeded so far as to form not only land 
and water, but even that highest type of organization which we call 
life. And in the course of this mysterious process there finally 
emerged the brains of human beings, who have just recently begun 
to look back and to inquire into the makeup of the star from which 
they came. 

It is an extremely interesting problem to try to explain with the 
help of physics and mathematics why a certain amount of material 
isolated in space should take on the particular size it does and begin 
to throw out in all directions energy at a particular rate. For every- 
thing we now know indicates that if you should put a certain number 
of million tons of cold stuff off in space it would do just that. If 
there were much more than this particular amount it would probably 
break up, and if there were much less it would never shine at all. 

Another reason for making an intensive study of the stars is the 
hope that such a study may supplement physics as we know it in 
our terrestrial laboratories. The stars provide us with a wide variety 
of conditions. The temperatures at the surfaces of many far exceed 
any which we can as yet produce, while the pressures in their atmos- 
pheres are often lower than any which we can obtain in the labora- 
tory. It is true that some things about the way atoms can behave 
have been learned first from the stars in recent years, but just now 
it seems more likely to be the other way about, and that physics, 
especially theoretical physics, will help to put together one of the 
most interesting puzzles known to us. And yet inside the stars is 
guarded the secret of at least one process which at present there is 
no prospect of duplicating in any terrestrial laboratory — the conver- 
sion of matter into energy. 

If we could be allowed to ask 10 questions about any star and have 
them answered, I think they might be these : 

1. "Wliat is its distance from us ? 

2. What is its velocity in space? 

3. Wliat is its true luminosity or candlepower? 

4. How large is it, in miles? 

5. What is its mass? 

6^ What substance is it made of? 

7. What is the temperature at its surface and how does it change 
toward the center? 

8. What is the pressure in its atmosphere and how does it change 
toward the center? 

9. How long is the life of a star? 

10. The most interesting question of all, What is the source of its 
continual flow of light and heat? 



STELLAR LABORATORIES — DUNHAM 261 

It is asking a great deal to expect to find out the detailed structure 
of an object which never appears otherwise than as a point of light, 
even in the largest telescope, but I hope to show that some of our 
questions about such an object can nevertheless be answered. 

The distance of a star was first measured by the amount of change 
in its apparent direction when the observer was carried from one side 
of the earth's orbit to the other side six months later. Even before 
the distance of any star was known, astronomers had noticed that 
some stars had changed their positions over a period of years. Arc- 
turus had moved rather more than 1 degree since the beginning 
of the Christian era. This might mean either that Arcturus was 
close to us and moved slowly, or that it was far away and traveled 
very fast. As soon as the distance became known, however, the 
apparent motion could at once be translated into true motion, and 
this turns out to be 84 miles per second. Most stars are found to be 
moving at a more deliberate pace, but 10 to 20 miles per second is 
very common among the stars^ 

It is easier to picture how far away a star like Arcturus must be, 
if we realize that even when moving at 8i miles a second it takes 
about 800 years for its direction to change by as much as the moon's 
apparent diameter. 

Knowledge of the distance of a star at once unlocks another most 
important fact, namely, its true luminosity or candlepower. A star 
will look bright either if it is very close and of moderate brightness 
or if it is far away and extremely brilliant. If the distance can 
be measured, we can decide immediately between these two possibili- 
ties, and from the apparent brightness we can find the actual candle- 
power of the star. 

It turns out that the candlepower of the stars varies to a remark- 
able degree. There is, in fact, as much difference between the faint- 
est and the brightest as between a firefly and a powerful searchlight. 
Our sun holds a place half-way between these limits and would 
correspond to an ordinary household electric light. 

In marked contrast to this great range in intrinsic brightness 
among the stars is their unexpected similarity in mass. It would 
be extremely difficult, and perhaps impossible, to determine the mass 
of a star were it not for the fortunate circumstance that many pairs 
of stars are known in which the two are held together by their 
mutual attraction while they revolve around a common center of 
gravity in elliptical orbits. If we know how far away such a pair 
of stars is from us, we can find out their masses from the speed with 
which they swing each other around in their orbits. The interesting 
result is that when we compare the masses of the stars with that 
of the sun we find them all very much alike. For there are a few 



262 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

stars 10 times as massive as the sun, and nearly all have at least one- 
tenth its mass. 

Now the true brightness of a star clearly depends on how big 
it is, but it also depends just as much on how bright a square inch 
of its surface is. And the brightness of each square inch is almost 
entirely a question of how hot it is. As a piece of iron is heated in 
a blacksmith's forge it gives out no visible light at first, but in time 
it begins to glow with a feeble reddish light. As the temperature 
increases two things happen. It gives out more light from each 
square inch, and the quality of the light changes from reddish to 
yellowish, and finally at very high temperatures is intensely bright 
and looks nearly white. These changes always happen together. It 
is impossible to heat a poker until it is very bright and to have it still 
look red. And it is equally impossible for a feebly shining poker to 
look white. Now the astronomer, imprisoned as he is upon the earth, 
far from his celestial experiment, is quick to take advantage of such 
a reliable connection between the surface brightness, the surface 
temperature, and the color of an object. 

In order to find the temperature of a star it is only necessary to 
measure its color. This is a straightforward process if a prism is 
used to break up the colors. Then by means of a photographic plate, 
or, still better, a radiometer, thermocouple, or photoelectric cell, the 
relative strengths of the red and the blue are measured. The propor- 
tion of blue light to red light increases as the temperature rises, and 
if a star is found to have a certain proportion of blue to red light its 
temperature can easily be inferred. It is worth while to note that 
we have here a means of finding the temperature of a star without 
knowing anything at all about its distance. For the color of an 
object ordinarily depends in no way on whether it is close or far 
away. 

As a matter of fact there are two exceptions to this rule. The set- 
ting sun looks red when the air is filled with smoke from a forest fire 
because the short waves of blue light are scattered by the tiny 
particles of smoke, while the longer red waves pass through to our 
eyes with little interference. The same thing may happen to star- 
light. It has been shown recently that some stars, particularly those 
at great distances, look redder than others, which in every other 
respect appear to be the same kind of star. This is taken as evidence 
for the existence of clouds of very small particles of material in ihe 
otherwise empty spaces between us and some of the distant stars. If 
such clouds of material are at all uniformly distributed through 
space, stars will look redder the farther away they are. 

The only other known case in which the color of objects is in- 
fluenced by their distance is that of the extremely distant nebulae, 



STELLAR LABORATORIES DUNHAM 263 

but here the apparent reddening seems to be due to properties of 
space which reveal themselves when great intervals are involved. 
Neither of these effects needs to be considered in studying stars rela- 
tively close to us within our own system. And so we may quite 
confidently infer the temperatures of these stars from their colors. 

We come now to the question, "How big are the stars?" Since we 
can not see the disk of any star with any telescope, we may proceed 
by an indirect method. 

Supjjose that I had a cannon ball and also a small bullet of 
something harder even than tungsten to melt. Suppose I were to 
place them side by side a quarter of a mile away where you could 
not see the disk on either, and heat them both equally until they 
were faintly red hot. The cannon ball would be quite easily visible, 
but the bullet would be so faint that you could hardly see it. If I 
assured you that they were equally distant and you could see that 
the color of both was the same you would at once know that the 
bullet must be smaller than the cannon ball, and if you had an instru- 
ment to measure how much fainter the bullet looked 5'ou could tell 
just how much smaller it must really be than the cannon ball. 

But now suppose I should somehow heat the bullet to a much 
higher temperature, so that it looked brilliantly white hot and should 
adjust the temperature until the bullet gave out as much light as the 
much larger, dull red cannon ball. Again suppose that I assured 
you the two were equally far away. If you were color-blind you 
would merely see two equally bright points of light and might quite 
naturally suppose them to be of equal size. But if your eyes were 
normal eyes you would almost instinctively allow for the fact that 
the white-hot bullet must be far brighter for every unit of its surface 
than the cooler, redder cannon ball. You would know that if the 
two seemed equally bright the white-hot bullet must be the smaller. 

In just the same way the astronomer who has measured the dis- 
tance and the color of a star can calculate its diameter in miles. 
Within recent years these calculated diameters have been beautifully 
confirmed by direct measurement of the diameters of several of the 
larger stars with the interferometer, an instrument which makes it 
possible to measure the apparent diameter of a star too small and 
too distant to show a disk in a telescope. 

With this confirmation of the method, the diameters of many stars 
have been determined. They show a remarkable range in size, from 
stars like the faint companion of Sirius, which is not much larger 
than the earth, all the way up to Antares, which is so tremendous a 
star that if the sun were at its center the orbit of the earth and even 
that of Mars would still be well below its surface. 



264 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

Now the masses of the stars do not show anything like this 
wide variation. In fact, we can say in a general way that all stars 
are made of pretty nearly the same amount of matter. And if this 
is the case, then matter must be very tightly packed in the small 
stars and spread very thin in the larger stars. If we could dip up 
with a teacup a sample of the stuff of which the companion of 
Sirius is made, we should need a powerful derrick to lift it, for at 
the surface of the earth it would weigh about 10 tons. It is hard 
to see how matter can be so tightly packed as this. The other extreme 
is no easier to understand, for an ordinary room full of the average 
stuff of which Antares is built would weigh hardly more than an 
ounce and the outer parts of the star must have matter even more 
rarefied than in the best vacuum we can produce in our own labo- 
ratories. It is hard to understand how a star built of such thin 
stuff can be sufficiently opaque to show any definite shape at all, but 
modern physics has answers ready for both these questions. 

The methods so far described have given us much information 
about the characteristics of many stars — their distances, sizes, masses, 
and superficial temperatures. But we are never satisfied. What 
we should really like to do is to be able to dip a thermometer into the 
stars and attach to them pressure gauges and read off their tempera- 
tures and pressures directly. We should also like to attach speed- 
ometers to stars to find out their velocities. Unfortunately we can 
not do this. But, as a matter of fact, nature has provided us with 
instruments which act as excellent thermometers, pressure gauges, 
and speedometers, if only we can read them. They occur in great 
numbers throughout the universe. They are atoms in the stars. 

Now it is true that atoms do not carry indicating dials on which 
we can read off directly what we want to know about the stars; 
but although very small they are nevertheless remarkable mecha- 
nisms, extraordinarily sensitive to the conditions in which they find 
themselves. All the light which comes to us from a star has started 
from individual atoms, and so the light carries with it a record of the 
physical conditions under which it was sent out. The atoms in the 
stars have been broadcasting a description of their surroundings for 
millions of years, but it is only recently that we have paid the least 
attention. The spectroscope has made it possible to record these 
atomic messages, but they are always in code. The study of atoms in 
our laboratories is giving us the key to this code and is helping us 
to read the information which is hidden in a stellar spectrum. 

We must not ask to see a correct and up-to-date picture of an atom. 
That has been impossible since 1925, in which year the atom became 
a ip function in higher mathematics and quite impossible to draw. It 
is just as real as it ever was, however, and just as reliable. But for 



STELLAR LABORATOEIES DUNHAM

our purposes it will be entirely satisfactory to think of the simpler 
and older model with electrons revolving around a central nucleus. 

To make things simpler still, we shall consider only one kind of 
atom, the calcium atom, because it illustrates so well some of the 
things I wish to describe. A calcium atom on the model we are using 
consists of a central positive nucleus which holds by electrostatic at- 
traction 20 negative electrons. Eighteen of these revolve about the 
nucleus in orbits relatively close to the nucleus and do not take any 
part in giving out the light which we see coming from the stars.

Figure 1. — Atomic transformations 
A, a rapidly moving atom colliding witii a normal atom. B, after the collision the 
first atom recedes more slowly than It approached, having transferred part of its 
energy to the second atom which is now in an excited state, i. e., one of its electrons 
now occupies a larger orbit. C, a light dart colliding with a normal atom able to 
absorb the exact amount of energy carried by the light dart. D, an excited atom 
which has stored the energy resulting from a collision either with another atom or 
with a liglit dart. E, the electron which occupied an excited orbit has fallen back 
to its normal position, and the energy which It had stored at D now appears in the 
form of a light dart traveling in a random direction. F, a slowly moving atom 
colliding with an excited atom. O, after the collision, the first atom Is recoiling 
more rapidly than it approached, having talcen up energy from the excited atom 
which is left in its normal state. An atom may become excited in two ways and an 
excited atom may unload its energy in two ways. Accordingly, atomic transforma- 
t''"^- may follow any one of four cycles ;

In Figure 1 the nucleus and these 18 inner electrons are all repre- 
sented by a large dot. But the two outer electrons are very im- 
portant. These are shown as smaller dots. 

Normally these two outer electrons circulate close to the nucleus. 
But they may also circulate in a number of larger orbits, of definite 
sizes. Intermediate positions do not occur. Now it takes energy or 
work to lift an electron from a smaller orbit to one of these larger 
or " excited " orbits, and this lifting of the electron can be done in 
either of the two ways illustrated in Figure 1- The first is by a 



266 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

collision with another atom. The atom is rushing about at the rate of 
2 or 3 miles a second among other atoms in a star and frequently 
collides with its neighbors. The violence of one of these collisions 
may be just enough to raise the electron to a larger orbit. 

The second way in which an electron can be raised to a higher 
orbit is by a collision with a dart of light. In the atmosphere of a 
star great quantities of light are coming through from deep layers on 
their way to the surface. As far as the atom is concerned this light 
acts as if it were in the form of minute darts of energy, each with a 
very definite rate of vibration and carrying a definite amount of 
energy. Those vibrating rapidly have short wave lengths, carry a 
large amount of energy, and appear blue to our eyes. Those vibrat- 
ing more slowly have longer wave lengths, carry less energy, and 
appear red. One of these light darts may strike an atom in its path, 
and, if the atom can respond exactly to the rate of vibration of the 
liglit dart, the energy which the light dart carries may raise one of 
the electrons in the atom to a larger orbit farther from the nucleus. 
Since the light dart is made of nothing but energy, and since it has 
transferred all of this energy to the atom, it entirely disappears as 
the result of striking the atom. 

Whether the atom was struck by another atom or whether it was 
hit by a light dart, the result is the same, namely, an atom that is 
wound up and has stored within it a definite amount of energy — 
the power to do work of some kind. But this lasts only for an in- 
stant. The electron must fall back. If undisturbed, the excited atom 
hesitates for about a hundredth of a millionth of a second, and then 
the electron falls to its normal place again. In doing so it unloads 
the energy it borrowed by shooting off another light dart exactly like 
the one which was absorbed. The only difference is that since the 
atom has absolutely no idea of aiming, the light dart is sent out 
entirely at random. 

There is another way in which the electron can fall back. While 
the atom is wound up and hesitating, another atom may strike it 
while traveling at a relatively moderate speed. If this happens the 
atom may unload its stored energy directly to this second atom. The 
colliding atom then bounces away faster than it struck, just as if it 
had touched off a stick of dynamite, while the electron in the first 
atom settles back into its normal orbit. 

We may now ask how atoms capable of passing through cycles 
such as we have described are able to write code messages in stellar 
spectra from which we may infer the conditions existing in the outer 
parts of stars. To understand this we must first consider what hap- 
pens when in the laboratory we artificially stir up an atom to produce 
a spectral line. This may be done quite easily by means of an electric 



STELLAR LABORATORIES DUNHAM 267 

arc in which many atoms collide so hard with one another that their 
electrons are forced into excited orbits from which they fall back 
with the emission of light darts. 

If a light dart is thrown out by an atom whose electron has 
fallen a long distance, i, e., from a very large orbit to a small one, 
then the light dart must carry away a large amount of energy, and 
it does this by vibrating at high frequency. But if it w^as thrown 
out by an atom which had less energy to unload because its electron 
did not have so far to fall, then the light dart will vibrate more 
slowly. Since both darts travel at the same speed, the high-energy

FiGDRH 2. — The formation of bright spectral lines 
Two atoms are shown, each with an electron in an excited orbit. Such atoms have 
In store an amount of energy which depends on the size of the orbit which the 
electron occupies. When the electron returns spontaneously to its normal orbit, 
the stored energy is thrown out in the form of a light dart. An electron falling 
from a relatively small orbit emits a small amount of energy. The resulting light 
dart has a low frequency of vibration, a long wave length, and appears at the red 
end of the spectrum. An electron falling from a larger orbit emits more energy, and 
the corresponding light dart has a higher frequency, a shorter wave length, and 
appears in the violet region of the spectrum. The light darts affect the photographic 
plate where they strike. At a and & the plates are turned through a right angle 
to show the resulting spectral lines. 

dart will have a short wave length, while the low-energy dart will 
have a long wave length. Figure 2 shows two such light darts 
approaching the slits of two spectrographs. 

The prism bends a high-energy light dart more than a low-energy 
dart, and the two will strike a photographic plate at entirely differ- 
ent places. Thus by measuring the image on the photograph we have 
an absolutely direct method of knowing how big a jump the electron 
made in the atom. 

There are all conceivable kinds of jumps between the many possi- 
ble orbits in which the electrons may start and end, but each sends 
out a slightly different light dart, which, after passing through the 



268 ANNUAL BEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

prism of our spectrograph, ends up in a different place on the photo- 
graph. 

Now to go back to the star. The hot, deep parts of the star are send- 
ing out light darts of every conceivable wave length. Except for a 
few which are stopped in the atmosphere of the star these light darts 
leave the star, and after traveling for years through empty space a 
small part of them strike the earth, and a still smaller part fall upon 
the lens or mirror of one of our telescopes, and are collected together 
and sent through a spectrograph (fig. 3). 

The spectrograph will sort these darts out according to their wave 
length, sending the short, blue ones to one end of the photographic 
plate, the longer, green ones to the middle, and the still longer, red

Figure 3. — The formation of a continuous spectrum with dark absorption lines 
Light darts of every conceivable wave length and fi'equency of vibration are emitted 
by the hot interiors of stars. If these could pass to the earth unobstructed, our 
spectrograph would sort them into a continuous band on the photographic plate, the 
light darts of longer wave length (red light) going to one end of the plate and 
those of shorter wave length (violet light) going to the other end. The two atoms 
shown in the diagram are supposed to be in the atmospliere of a star and to be 
capable of becoming excited through the absorption of quantities of energy exactly 
corresponding to the quantities carried by the light darts C and O. As a result, 
these particular light darts are absorbed in the stellar atmosphere and are missing 
from the otherwise continuous band of color which falls upon the plate. The 
spectrum shows a bright background crossed by two absorption lines. 

<ines to the other end of the plate. Since the deep layers of the star 
are giving out light darts of every possible wave length, after pass- 
ing through the prism, there will be a solid band of color. We caU 
this a continuous spectrum. 

But the interesting thing is that some of these light darts do not 
escape from the star. Some of them of particular wave lengths are 
sidetracked by atoms which absorb them in the outer layers of the 
star, and never get to the earth at all. Where they would have fallen 
on the plate there are dark empty spaces. This is how we first dis- 
covered that there are atoms in the stars. These dark spaces on the 
plate we know as spectral lines and they make up our code message 
from the stars.

We are now ready to look at the actual situation in a stellar atmos- 
phere. Figure 4 represents a thin slice through the middle of the 
atmospheres of three different stars. The center one represents the 
atmosphere of our sun. Light and heat are coming up in great 
amounts from the depths of the sun below the bottom of the diagram.

FiGDRB 4. — Atomic processes in stellar atmospheres 
The diagram shows idealized cross sections of three stellar atmospheres to illustrate 
the influence of temperature and pressure on the relative numbers of normal, excited, 
and ionized calcium atoms and the resulting differences in the spectra of the light 
which has come to us after passing through these atmospheres. The spectrum at 
the lower part of the diagram shows the lines characteristic of each of the three 
types of calcium atoms. Differences in the relative Intensities of these lines in the 
spectra of various stars serve as measures of the numbers of atoms of each type 
which are present in the atmospheres of these stars, and so make it possible to infer 
the temperatures and pressures at the surfaces of the stars. The spectra in this 
diagram are in the form of photographic negatives so that dark absorption lines 
appear as white lines on a dark background. A, a normal atom ; B, an excited 
atom ; C, an ionized atom ; D. an excited atom ; E, a doubly ionized atom, which has 
lost two electrons ; F, a free electron ; O, a light dart colliding with a normal atom 
and exciting one of its electrons ; Jf, two atoms which have just collided ; one of 
them is left excited ; I, an excited atom which has returned to its normal condition, 
emitting a light dart in a random direction ; J, an excited ionized atom which is 
exciting another ionized atom by collision ; K, a light dart exciting an ionized atom. 

After working their way between the atoms in the atmosphere they 
pass on beyond the top of the diagram, through the upper limits of 
the atmosphere, and plunge off into outer space. 

At the high temperature of the solar atmosphere, all the atoms are 
moving about quite rapidly and colliding frequently with one an- 



270 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

other, so that if at any one instant a snapshot photograph, such as 
this diagram, could be taken, we should find that a considerable num- 
ber of the calcium atoms had just undergone collisions which had 
lifted one of their electrons into a larger or excited orbit. 

At this temperature light darts are also very plentiful, rushing 
about in all directions among the atoms. By striking normal atoms, 
they produce still more excited atoms. Wlien an atom which has al- 
ready been excited by one collision is struck a second time before it 
has recovered from the first collision, the electron may be knocked 
entirely off the atom. The mutilated atom which remains is called 
an " ionized " atom. 

We have, then, in the solar atmosphere at any one instant three 
kinds of calcium atoms: The normal atom, the excited atom, and 
the ionized atom. 

Now, we have seen that any particular atom can absorb a light 
dart if the energy of the light dart is of exactly the right amount 
to raise one of the electrons in the atom into one of its possible 
orbits. If this happens, that particular light dart is lost forever as 
far as we and our spectrographs are concerned, because the atom, in 
unwinding, will either send out a second dart in a random direction 
or else will use the stored energy to kick one of its neighbors, in 
which case the energy goes into heat and is again diverted. 

Thus the atoms in the atmosphere stand at the gateway between 
the star and outer space and each one sidetracks light darts of a 
particular energy and color. The result is that each type of atom 
is responsible for characteristic gaps or dark lines in the otherwise 
continuous band of color. 

The normal calcium atoms absorb blue light, causing a single 
dark line in the blue part of the spectrum. The excited atoms 
absorb red light, causing primarily a strong group of three lines 
close together in the red part of the spectrum, while the ionized 
atoms which have lost an electron absorb violet light, causing a pair 
of conspicuous lines in the violet. 

Now, the strength of these spectral lines depends in a striking way 
on the number of atoms causing them, so that if with our spectro- 
graphs we can measure the strength of the lines it means that we 
can count the number of atoms of each kind. When many atoms 
cause a line, the line is wide and when the atoms are few the line 
is narrow. This we speak of as differences in line-intensity. 

In the sun the lines we are discussing are of very different intensi- 
ties, but they have intentionally been made equal in Figure 4 so as 
to bring out more clearly the variations when we pass to other stars. 

In the right-hand section of the diagram we have the atmos- 
phere of a star, such as Procyon, which is at a higher temperature 



STELLAB LABORATORIES — DUNHAM 271 

than that of the sun. The atoms are rushing about more rapidly, and 
on the average the light darts are more numerous and also more 
energetic. The vibrations are faster and the wave lengths are shorter. 
Because the light darts are more energetic and because the collisions 
are more violent at this higher temperature there will be fewer nor- 
mal atoms. More atoms will be excited and more will be ionized than 
in the sun. Now, as we have seen, the width and the strength of a 
spectral line depends on the number of atoms responsible for it. A 
single atom would never show a line in our spectrograph, but when 
several million million are doing the same thing at once enough 
light is held back to make a noticeable dark lir^e. In the present 
case the line in the blue corresponding to the normal atom is weaker 
than in the sun, while the triplet in the red, corresponding to the 
excited atoms is considerably strengthened, and so is the pair of 
lines in the violet corresponding to the ionized atoms. What we can 
observe is of course only the spectrum and not the atoms responsible 
for it. So when we see a spectrum whose lines have these relative 
intensities we must infer that we are dealing with a star that is hotter 
than the sun. 

The left part of the diagram represents the atmosphere of a very 
different kind of star such as y Cygni. The temperature here is the 
same as in the sun, but the pressure is much lower. Since the tem- 
perature is the same, the violence of the collisions is the same, the 
number and energy of the light darts is the same, but the pressure 
is lower, which means that the atoms are farther apart. Occasional 
atoms will become ionized, just as in the case of the sun, because 
collisions with light darts will be no less effective. But w4ien once an 
electron has been torn loose from an atom it will be much more diffi- 
cult for this free electron to find another mutilated atom with which 
it can recombine to form a normal atom. And so it happens that in 
this star the proportion of ionized atoms is greater than in the sun, 
while the number of normal and excited atoms are both reduced, 
without changing their proportion relative to one another. 

The increased number of ionized atoms results in a marked 
strengthening of the pair of lines in the violet. The line in the blue 
corresponding to the normal atom and the red triplet corresponding 
to the excited atom are somewhat weaker than in the sun, but the 
relative strengths of these lines remain unchanged. 

The net result of all this is that, when we develop a photographic 
plate taken with our telescope and find on it a spectrum with the 
red triplet looking stronger than the blue line, we know that the 
light must have come from a star with an atmosphere at a high 
temperature, while if we get a spectrum with the violet pair stronger 
than the blue line, we know that we are dealing with a star whose 



272 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

atmosphere is at low pressure. When we combine this method with 
what can be learned from the colors of the stars we find temperatures 
ranging all the way from 1,600° in long-period variable stars at mini- 
mum brightness up to over 30,000° C. for the hottest blue stars. 

The pressures in the atmospheres turn out to be surprisingly low, 
and, although there are wide variations from star to star, the pres- 
sures do not in general exceed one-thousandth of that of air at the 
earth's surface. On some stars the atmospheres are at pressures 
much lower than this. The entire atmosphere of the sun as far 
down as we can see is about 50 to 100 miles deep, but there is so little 
stuff in all this depth that it corresponds to only about 5 or 6 feet 
of ordinary air. An amount of material which is absolutely trans- 
parent here becomes so foggy on the sun as to be nearly opaque, be- 
cause of the great number of free electrons and ionized atoms which 
can stop passing light darts and send them flying off in other direc- 
tions and even turn them into heat. 

I have said that there are great differences in the pressures at the 
surfaces of different stars. Differences in pressure must mean differ- 
ences in the force with which gravity packs down the material. And 
differences in the force of gravity must mean one of two things: 
Either differences in the masses of the stars or differences in the 
distance from the surface to the center. We have already found 
that the masses of all the stars are more or less alike, but that their 
sizes do differ enormously. And so the pressure differences which 
we can interpret from the line-intensities in the spectra of these 
stars really mean differences in the sizes and therefore in the actual 
brightness of the stars. Of course, we want to know the true candle- 
power of as many stars as possible, in order that we may determine 
their distances, which, as we have seen, may be done with the aid 
of their apparent brightness. 

If we could really count accurately the number of calcium atoms 
of the three kinds shown in Figure 4 by measuring the strengths 
of the spectral lines which they produce, and if the simple theory con- 
necting the numbers of the three kinds of atoms with the tempera- 
ture and pressure were entirely satisfactory, we could, by studying 
the spectrum of a star, calculate exactly what pressure must exist 
in its atmosphere to give this spectrum and could go from that to its 
true brightness. Some day we hope that it may be possible to do this, 
but at present the results can be only approximate because the condi- 
tions in stellar atmospheres are more complex than Figure 4 indicates. 

Fortunately a powerful empirical method can be used. In 1914 
Doctor Adams and Doctor Kohlschiitter studied in detail the differ- 
ences in the spectra of nearby stars whose true brightness was already 
known. We have seen that the spectra of two stars may be very 



STELLAR LABORATORIES DUNHAM 273 

different, even when the temperature of the two is the same, the 
difference being due entirely to pressure, which means that the dif- 
ference is connected with the sizes, and so with the luminosities of 
the stars. 

When enough stars of known brightness had been studied to 
show just how the spectrum depends on intrinsic brightness, it was 
quite simple to match with these the spectra of other stars and thus 
find their true brightness and from that their distance. It is the 
distance which we particularly want for mapping out the arrange- 
ment of the stars in space, and this method for deriving it looked at 
first too good to be true. 

But the severest tests have only increased our confidence in its 
reliability^ The distances of several thousand stars have been de- 
termined in this way, including many much too far away to investi- 
gate by the direct surveying method. We must not forget, how- 
ever, that the calibration of this far-reaching spectroscopic method 
depends entirely on the surveyed distances of representative stars. 

So much for temperature and pressure revealed to us by the atoms. 
They tell us three other things. First, the velocity of a star to- 
ward us or away from us. The positions of the lines in the spectrum 
of a stationary star are well known and can be depended upon not 
to vary by one part in a million. But if the star is moving toward us 
at any considerable speed the waves of light tend to pile up slightly, 
and more of them enter our spectrograph in a second than would if 
the star were at rest. This results in displacing all the spectral lines 
to the violet of their normal positions, and the amount of the dis- 
placement is a measure of the velocity of the star. This method is 
not adapted to measuring the velocity of a man walking down the 
street; in fact it could just detect the motion of a racing car headed 
toward the telescope and carrying a neon lamp as a source of light. 
But it is well adapted to measuring stellar velocities, which are often 
20 or 30 miles a second. 

When a star rotates and the axis of rotation does not happen to 
point directly toward us, one side of the star will approach us while 
the other recedes. The approaching side of the star tends to dis- 
place all spectral lines to the blue, while the other side displaces these 
same lines to the red. The result is that the lines are greatly widened 
and no longer look sharp. Plate I (A) and (B) shows the spectrum 
of a Aquilae, a rapidly rotating star, with the spectrum of a Cygni 
for comparison. The distinguishing feature of the spectrum of a 
rotating star is that all the lines are widened. 

It has long been known that if an atom emits light while in a 
strong electric field some of the lines are widened. In some of the 
hotter stars, the hydrogen lines are extremely wide, while the metal- 



274 ANNUAL REPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

lie lines are still relatively sharp. Since hydrogen shows the effect 
of an electric field far more than any other element, it is believed 
that such fields are present in these hot stars. Plate 1 (6') and (Z>) 
shows the spectra of Sirius with a Cygni again for comparison. It 
is easy to see that each member of the series of hydrogen lines in 
Sirius is considerably wider than in a Cygni. Spectra on a larger 
scale show little difference in the metallic lines. Electric fields in 
a stellar atmosphere are probably caused chiefly by the negatively 
charged electrons and the positively charged ions passing close to 
the atoms and disturbing them. The number of charged particles 
close enough to disturb an atom naturally increases with the pressure, 
and so it begins to look as if the widths of spectral lines, particularly 
of the hydrogen lines, may in the future serve as another indicator 
of the pressure. 

In everything thus far said we have considered the atmosphere 
of the star as a whole, since we can not see its disk; and the atoms 
have shown themselves only by absorbing out light from the con- 
tinuous spectrum of the white light which passes by them from the 
inside of the star. In one case only can we study the atmosphere of 
a star without interference from the light inside and that is our 
own star, the sun, when the moon passes across it at the time of a 
total eclipse. For several seconds the main body of the sun is then 
entirely covered, while the atmosphere at its edge still shows. A 
spectrogram made at such a time shows a spectrum of the atmos- 
phere entirely by itself, and the atoms of the vaporized metals above 
the sun give their own pure spectrum of bright lines. Plate I {E, 
F, G) shows such a spectrum taken at the eclipse in northern Cali- 
fornia on April 28, 1930. The light of the disappearing crescent of 
the solar atmosphere is split up into more than a thousand separate 
crescents of different colors. Each of these crescents shows by its 
intensity the amount of the element to which it belongs in the solar 
atmosphere. The bright bands of continuous spectrum were caused 
by minute bits of the sun itself, which still showed through deep 
valleys on the edge of the moon when the photograph was made. 
The intervening mountains projected beyond the solar disk, and 
there we obtained a spectrum of the upper atmosphere without any 
of the lower strata. 

Another way to take a spectrum of the solar atmosphere at 
an eclipse is to use a spectrograph with a slit and to move the plate 
by means of a screw at an even rate of speed while the moon is 
covering the sun's atmosphere. One of the best plates of this kind 
was taken by Doctor Campbell, of the Lick Observatory, at the 
eclipse of 1905. Tlie moon moves in its orbit about half a mile in 
every second, which means that it covers up about 200 miles of solar 



STELLAR LABOEATORIES DUNHAM 275 

atmosphere each second. This gives us a scale of miles on the plate, 
and we can see just hoAv the solar atmosphere fades away in its upper 
regions. It turns out that most of the ordinary absorption spectrum 
is given by a layer not much more than 100 miles thick. But above 
this is a vast outer atmosphere known as the chromosphere in which 
the various elements reach up to different heights. Calcium and 
hydrogen have been traced as high as 10,000 miles. It is probable 
that it is the pressure of the intense light from the solar surface be- 
low which supports these atoms, since the gas pressure at this level 
would be entirely inadequate. A study of the chromosphere is par- 
ticularly interesting because it is one of the few places in the uni- 
verse where atoms can be examined while acting each one for itself, 
without disturbance by its neighbors. The pressure is in fact so 
very low that an atom probably travels thousands of miles without 
striking another atom, whereas the particles of air under ordinary 
conditions are experiencing thousands of collisions in every inch 
they move. 

So far I have said nothing about the insides of stars. We have 
been discussing only the merest outer skin, which is kept in its 
present brilliant state by what is going on below. When we inquire 
into the conditions within a star, the methods which are useful for 
determining temperatures and pressures at the surface fail us and 
we are thrown back on what Eddington calls an " analytical boring 
machine." If we give the problem to a mathematician, telling him 
that he may assume the material to act as a perfect gas and ask him 
to apply the elementary principles of physics, he will come back 
with a large part of the answer. 

It turns out that the temperature at the center of the sun is about 
30,000,000° C, that the pressure is 200 million tons on every square 
inch of area, and that the material is crowded until it has 28 times 
the density of water. Under these conditions the atoms are scarcely 
recognizable. They have had all but their last few electrons torn 
away, and are rushing about with velocities which would carry them 
from California to New York and back in a second if their directions 
were not changed a million times in the interval. 

All this is interesting enough, but there is one thing still more 
remarkable about the stars. They are sending into outer space tre- 
mendous quantities of heat and light, and they have been doing it for 
a long time in the past. Geologists tell us that the earth must have 
been here for at least a thousand million years. But there are various 
astronomical arguments which lead us to believe that the stars have 
ages even a thousand times as great as this. 

No source of energy with which we are familiar could provide so 
much heat for so long a time. Simple cooling would last only a short 

102992—32 19 



276 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

time. The burning of hydrogen and oxygen would not last the sun 
more than one-tenth of the lifetime of our earth. Radium has been 
suggested. If the sun were made of pure radium, it would give out 
as much heat as the sun has given out since the earth was started, but 
it would be very unequally distributed over this period of time. For 
2,000 years the sun would shine with a furious heat and then rapidly 
cool and become invisible. 

Only two possibilities remain. The first is that matter itself is 
being transformed into radiant energy deep in the stars. If this is 
the source of the sun's heat, we can calculate on the theory of rela- 
tivity that the sun is consuming every three hours as much matter 
as there is in the bulk of Mount Wilson. And yet the sun is so large 
that it could well stand this loss and go on shining for several million 
million years to come. 

The other possibility is that the stars were once composed entirely 
of hydrogen and that the atoms of hydrogen are uniting to build up 
the heavier atoms of other elements. In the process of becoming thus 
tightly packed, a small but definite fraction of the mass must be lost, 
and its equivalent must appear as energy. If this is the source of 
stellar energy, the life of a star is 100 times shorter than if there 
were complete annihilation of matter, and every two minutes a mass 
of hydrogen equivalent to the bulk of Mount Wilson is built up in 
the sun into atoms of more complex elements.

PEESENT STATUS OF THEORY AND EXPERIMENT AS 
TO ATOMIC DISINTEGRATION AND ATOMIC SYN- 
THESIS ^ 



By ROBEET A. MiLLIKAN 

California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif. 



My task is to attempt to trace the history of the development of 
scientific evidence bearing on the question of the origin and destiny 
of the physical elements. I shall list 10 discoveries or developments, 
all made within the past 100 years, which touch in one way or an- 
other upon this problem and constitute indications or sign-posts 
on the road toward an answer. 

Prior to the middle of the nineteenth century little experimental 
evidence of any sort had appeared, so that the problem was wholly 
in the hands of the philosopher and the theologian. Then came, 
first, the discovery of the equivalence of heat and work, and the con- 
sequent formulation of the principle of the conservation of energy, 
probably the most far-reaching physical principle ever developed. 

Following this, and directly dependent upon it, came, second, the 
discovery, or formulation, of the second law of thermodynamics, 
which was first interpreted, and is still interpreted by some, as ne- 
cessitating the ultimate " heat-death " of the universe and the final 
extinction of activity of all sorts; for all hot bodies are observed 
to be radiating away their heat, and this heat after having been 
so radiated away into space apparently can not be reclaimed by man. 
This is classically and simply stated in the humpty-dumpty rhyme. 
As a natural if not necessary corollary to this was put forward 
by some, in entire accord with the demands of medieval theology, 
a Deus ex machina initially to wind up or start off this running- 
down universe. 

Then came, third, the discovery, through studies both in geology 
and biology, of the facts of evolution — facts which showed that, 
so far as the biological field is concerned, the process of creation, 
or upbuilding from lower to higher forms, has been continuously

going on for millions upon millions of years and is presumably 
going on now. This tended to direct attention away from the Deus 
ex machina, to identify the Creator with His universe, to strengthen 
(he theological doctrine of immanence, which represents substan- 
tially the philosophic position of Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo, New- 
ton, Francis Bacon, and most of the great minds of history down 
to Einstein. 

Neither evolution nor evolutionists have in general been athe- 
istic — Darwin least of all — but their influence has undoubtedly been 
to raise doubts about the legitimac}^ of the dogma of the Deus ex 
machina and of the correlative one of the heat-death. This last 
dogma rests squarely on the assumption that we, infinitesimal mites 
on a speck of a world, know all about how the universe behaves in 
all its parts, or more specifically, that the radiation laws which 
seem to us to hold here can not possibly have any exceptions any- 
where, even though that is precisely the sort of sweeping generaliza- 
tion that has led us physicists into error half a dozen times during 
the past 30 years, and also though we know quite well that condi- 
tions prevail outside our planet which we can not here duplicate or 
even approach. Therefore the heat-death dogma has always been 
treated with reserve by the most thoughful of scientific workers. No 
more crisp or more cogent statement of what seems to me to be the 
correct position of science in this regard has come to my attention 
than is found in the following recent utterance of Gilbert N. Lewis, 
namely, " Thermodynamics gives no support to the assumption that 
the universe is running down. Gain of entroj)y aVicm/s vieans loss 
of information and nothing more.^'' 

The fourth discovery bearing on our theme was the discovery 
that the dogma of the immutable elements was definitely wrong. By 
the year 1900 the element radium had been isolated and tlie mean 
lifetime of its atoms found to be about 2,000 years. This meant def- 
initely that the radium atoms that are here now have been formed 
within about that time; and a year or two later the element helium 
was definitely observed to be growing out of radium here and now. 
This raised insistently the question as to whether the creation, or 
at least the formation, of all the elements out of something else may 
not be a continuous process — stupendous change in viewpoint the 
discovery of radioactivity brought about, and a wholesome lesson 
of modesty it taught to the physicist. But a couple of years later, 
uranium and thorium, the heaviest known elements, were definitely 
caught in the act of begetting radium, and all the allied chain of 
disintegration products. Since, however, the lifetime of the parent 
atom, uranium, has now been found to be a billion years or so, we 



ATOMIC DISINTEGRATION MILLIKAN 279 

have apparently ceased to inquire whence it comes. We are dis- 
posed to assume, however, that it is not now being formed on earth. 
Indeed, we have good reason to believe that the whole radioactive 
process is confined to a very few, very heavy elements which are now 
giving up the energy which was once stored up in them — we know 
not how — so that radioactivity', though it seemed at first to be point- 
ing away from the heat-death, has not at all, in the end, done so. 
Indeed, it seems to be merely one mechanism by which stored-up 
energy is being frittered away into apparently unreclaimable radiant 
heat — another case of humpty-dumpty. 

The fifth significant discovery was the enormous lifetime of the 
earth — partly through radioactivity itself, which assigns at least a 
billion and a half years — and the still greater lifetime of the sun 
and stars — thousands of times longer than the periods through which 
they could possibly exist as suns if they were simply hot bodies 
cooling off. This meant that new and heretofore unknown sources 
of heat energy had to be found to keep the stars pouring out such 
enormous quantities of radiation for such ages upon ages. 

The sixth discovery, and in many ways the most important of all, 
was the development of evidence for the interconvertibility of mass 
and energy. This came about in three ways. In 1901, Kaufman 
showed experimentally that the mass of an electron could be increased 
by increasing sufficiently its velocity; that is, energy could be 
definitely converted into mass. About the same time tlie pressure 
of radiation was experimentally established by Nichols and Hull at 
Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and Lebedew, at Moscow. This 
meant that radiation possesses the only distinguishing property of 
mass, the property by which we define it, namely, inertia. The 
fundamental distinction between radiation and matter thus disap- 
peared. These were direct, experimental discoveries. Next, in 1905, 
Einstein developed the interconvertibility of mass and energy as a 
necessary consequence of the special theory of relativity. If, then, 
the mass of the sun could in any way be converted into radiant heat, 
there would be an abundant source of energy to keep the sun going 
so long as necessary, and all our difficulties about the lifetimes of the 
sun and stars would have disappeared. But what could be the mech- 
anism of this transformation? 

Then came the seventh discovery, which constituted a very clear 
finger-post, pointing to the possibility of the existence of an integrat- 
ing or building-up process among the physical elements, as well as 
in biological forms, in the discovery that the elements are all defi- 
nitely built up out of hydrogen; for they — the 92 different atoms — 
were all found, beginning about 1913, by the new method of so-called 
positive ray analysis, to be exact multiples of the weight of hydrogen 



280 ANNUAL, EEPORT SMITHSONIAIST INSTITUTION", 1931 

within very small limits of uncertainty. This fact alone raises very 
insistently the query as to whether they are not being built up some- 
where out of hydrogen now. They certainly were once so put to- 
gether, and some of them, the radioactive ones, are now actually 
caught in the act of splitting up. Is it not highly probable, so would 
say any observer, that the inverse process is going on somewhere, 
especially since the process would involve no violation either of the 
energy principle or of the second law of thermodynamics; for hydro- 
gen, the element out of which they all must be built, has not a 
weight exactly one in terms of the other 92, but about 1 per cent 
more than one, so that since mass or weight had been found in the 
sixth discovery to be expressible in terms of energy, the union of 
any number of hydrogen atoms into any heavier element, meant that 
1 per cent of the total available potential energy had disappeared 
and was therefore available for appearance as heat. 

When, about 1914-15 this fact was fitted by MacMillan, Harkins, 
and others into the demand made above in the fifth discover}^ for a 
new source of energy to keep the sun pouring out heat so copiously 
for such great lengths of time, it seemed to the whole world of 
physics that the building up of the heavier elements out of hydrogen 
under the conditions existing within the sun and stars had been 
practically definitely proved to be taking place. This would not 
provide an escape from the heat-death, but it would enormously 
postpone it, that is, until all the hydrogen in the universe had been 
converted into the heavier elements. 

By this process, however, the suns could stoke at most but 1 per 
cent of their total mass, assuming they were wholly hydrogen to 
begin with, into their furnaces, and 99 per cent of the mass of the 
universe would remain as cold, dead ash when the fires were all gone 
out and the heat-death had come. But about 1917 the astronomer 
began to chafe under the time limitation thus imposed upon him, 
and this introduced the eighth consideration bearing upon our theme. 
He could get a hundred times more time — from now on, much more 
than that, because only a small fraction of the matter in the universe 
is presumably now hydrogen — by assuming that, in the interior of 
heavy atoms, occasionally a negative electron gets tired of life at the 
pace it has to be lived in the electron world, and decides to end it all 
and commit suicide; but, being paired by Nature in electron-fate 
with a positive, he has to arrange a suicide 2)act with his mate, and so 
the two jump into each other's arms in the nucleus, and the two 
complementary electron lives are snuffed out at once ; but not with- 
out the letting loose of a terrific death-yell, for the total mass of 
the two must be transformed into a powerful ether pulse which, by 
being absorbed in the surrounding matter, is supposed to keep up 



ATOMIC DISINTEGRATION MILLIKAN 281 

the mad, hot pace in the interiors of the suns. This discovery, or 
suggestion, to account for the huge estimated stellar lifetimes, of 
the complete annihilation of positive and negative electrons within 
the nucleus, makes it unnecessary to assume, at least for stellar life- 
time purposes, the building up of the heavier elements out of hydro- 
gen. Indeed, it seems rather unlikely that both kinds of processes, 
atom-building and atom-annihilating, are going on together in the 
same spot under the same conditions; so we must turn to further 
experimental facts to get more light. 

The ninth sign-post came into sight in 1927, when Aston made a 
most precise series of measurements on the relative masses of the 
atoms, which made it possible to subject to a new test the Einstein 
formula for the relation between mass and energy, namely, E=Mg'. 
This Aston curve is one of the most illuminating finger-pointings 
we now have. It shows that : 

1. Einstein's equation actually stands the quantitative test for 
radioactive or disintegrating processes right well, and therefore 
receives new experimental credentials. 

2. The radioactive or disintegrating process with the emission 
of an alpha ray must be confined to a very few heavy elements, since 
these are the only ones so situated on the curve that mass can dis- 
appear, and hence heat energy appear, through such disintegration. 

3. All the most common elements, except hydrogen, are already 
in their most stable condition; that is, their condition of minimum 
mass, so that if we disintegrate them we shall have to do work upon 
them, rather than get energy out of them. 

4. Therefore, man's only possible source of energy other than the 
sun is the upbuilding of the common elements out of hydrogen or 
helium, or else the entire annihilation of positive and negative elec- 
trons; and there is no likelihood that either of these processes is a 
possibility on earth. 

5. If the foregoing upbuilding process is going on anywhere, the 
least penetrating and the most abundant radiation produced by it, 
that corresponding to the formation of helium out of hydrogen, 
ought to be about 10 times as energetic as the hardest gamma rays, 
that is, it ought to correspond to about twenty-seven million electron- 
volts in place of two and a half million. 

6. Other radiations corresponding to the only other abundant ele- 
ments, namely, oxygen (oxygen, nitrogen, carbon), silicon (mag- 
nesium, aluminum, silicon), and iron (iron group), should be found 



282 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

about 4 times, 7 times, and 14 times as energetic as the " helium 
rays." 

7. The radiation corresponding to the smallest annihilation process 
that can take place — the suicide of a positive and negative electron — 
is 350 times as energetic as the hardest gamma ray, or 35 times as 
energetic as the " helium ray." 

This brings us to the tenth discovery, that of the cosmic rays. 
These reveal : ^ 

1. A radiation, the chief component of which, according to our 
direct comparison, is five times as penetrating as the hardest gamma 
ray, which, with the best extrapolation we can make on the curve 
connecting energy and penetrating power, means a ray 10 times as 
energetic as the hardest gamma ray, precisely according to prediction. 

2. Special bands of cosmic radiation that are roughly where they 
should be to be due to the formation of the foregoing abundant ele- 
ments out of hydrogen, though (for reasons to be given presently) 
no precise quantitative check is to be expected except in the case of 
the helium rays. 

3. No radiation of significant amxount anywhere near where it is 
to be expected from the annihilation hypothesis, thus indicating that 
at least 95 per cent of the observed cosmic raj^s are due to some other 
less energetic processes. 

4. A radiation that is completely independent of the sun, the great 
hot mass just off our bows, and not appreciably dependent on the 
Milky Way or the nearest spiral nebula, Andromeda, one that comes 
in to us practically uniformly from all portions of the celestial dome, 
and is so invariable with both time and latitude at a given elevation 
that the observed small fluctuations at a given station reflect with 
much fidelity merely the changes in the thickness of the absorbing 
air blanket through which the rays have had to pass to get to the 
observer. 

This last property is the most amazing and the most significant 
property exhibited by the cosmic rays, and before drawing the final 
conclusions its significance will be discussed. For it means that at 
the time these rays enter the earth's atmosphere, they are practically 
pure ether waves or photons. If they were high-speed electrons or 
even had been appreciably transformed by Compton encounters in 
passing through matter into such high-speed electrons or beta rays, 
these electrons would of necessity spiral about the lines of force of 
the earth's magnetic field and thus enter the earth more abundantly 
near the earth's magnetic poles than in lower latitudes. This is 
precisely what the experiments made during the last summer at

ATOMIC DISINTEGBATIOIT MILLIKAN" 283 

Churchill, Manitoba (lat. 59° N.), within 730 miles of the north 
magnetic pole, showed to be not true, the mean intensity of the rays 
there being not measurably different from that at Pasadena in 
latitude 34° N. 

Nor is the conclusion that the cosmic rays enter the eartli's atmos- 
phere as a practically pure photon beam dependent upon these meas- 
urements of last summer alone. It follows also from the high alti- 
tude sounding-balloon experiments of Millikan and Bowen in April, 
1922, taken in connection with the lower balloon flights of Hess and 
Kolhorster in 1911-1914. For in going to an altitude of 15.5 km we 
got but one-fourth the total discharge of our electroscope which we 
computed we should have obtained from the extrapolation of our 
predecessors' curves. This shows that somewhere in the atmosphere 
below a height of 15. 5 km the intensity of the ionization within a 
closed vessel exposed to the rays goes through a maximum, and then 
decreases, quite rapidly, too, in going to greater heights. We have 
just taken very accurate observations up to the elevation of the top of 
Pikes Peak (4.3 km), and found that within this range the rate of 
increase with altitude is quite as large as that found in the Hess and 
Kolhorster balloon flights, so that there can be no uncertainty at all 
about the existence of this maximum. Such a maximum, however, 
means that the rays, before entering the atmosphere, have not passed 
through enough matter to begin to get into equilibrium with their 
secondaries — electron-rays + or— , rays and photons of reduced fre- 
quency — in other words, that they have not come through an appreci- 
able amount of matter in getting from their place of origin to the 
earth. 

This checks with the lack of effect of the earth's magnetic field on 
the intensity of the rays; and the two phenomena, of quite unrelated 
kinds and brought to light years apart, when taken together, prove 
most conclusively, I think, that the cosmic rays can not originate even 
in the outer atmospheres of the stars, though these are full of hydro- 
gen and helium in a high-temperature state, but that they must origi- 
nate rather in those portions of the universe from which the}' can 
come to tlie earth without traversing matter in quantity that is ap- 
preciable even as compared with the thickness of the earth's atmos- 
phere — in other words, that they must originate in the intensely cold 
regions in the depths of interstellar space. 

Further, the more penetrating the secondary rays produced by 
photon encounters, the greater the thickness of matter that must be 
traversed before the beam of pure photons which enters the atmos- 
phere gets into equilibrium with its secondaries; and until such equi- 
librium is reached, the apparent absorption coefficient must be less 
than the coefficient computed for pure photons with the aid of any 



284 ANNUAL, REPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

formula from the energy released in the process from which the 
radiation arises. Now the.Bothe-Kolhorster experiments of about a 
year ago seem to show that when the energies of the incident photons 
are sufficiently high, the rays are abnormally penetrating; so that 
it is to be expected that, for the cosmic rays produced by the forma- 
tion of the heavier of the common elements like silicon and iron out 
of hydrogen, the observed absorption coefficients will be somewhat 
smaller than those computed from the energy available for their 
formation. This is indeed the behavior which our cosmic ray 
depth-ionization curve seems to reveal. At the highest altitudes at 
which we have recently observed (14,000 ft.), the helium rays have 
reached equilibrium Avith their secondaries, and the observed and 
computed coefficients agree reasonably well. For the oxygen rays 
the observed coefficient is a little lower than the computed value — 
about IT per cent lower; for the silicon rays still lower — about 30 
per cent ; and for the iron rays considerably lower still — about 60 per 
cent; all in general qualitative agreement with the theoretical de- 
mands as outlined. 

The foregoing results seem to point with some definiteness to the 
following conclusions : 

1. The cosmic rays have their origin not in the stars but rather in 
interstellar space. 

2. They seem to be due to the building up in the depths of space of 
the commoner lieavy elements out of hydrogen, which the spectroscopy 
of the heavens shows to be widely distributed through space. That 
helium and the common elements of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and 
even sulphur, are also found between the stars is proved by Bowen's 
beautiful recent discovery that the " nebulium lines " arise from these 
very elements. 

3. These atom-building processes can not take place under the con- 
ditions of temperature and pressure existing in the sun and stars, 
the heats of these bodies having to be maintained presumably by 
the atom-annihilating process postulated by Jeans and Eddington 
as taking place there. 

4. All this says nothing at all about the second law of thermo- 
dynamics or the Wiirme-Tod, but it does contain a bare suggestion 
that if atom formation out of hydrogen is taking place all through 
space, as it seems to be doing, it may be that the hydrogen is some- 
how being replenished there, too, from the only form of energy that 
we know to be all the time leaking out from the stars to interstellar 
space, namely, radiant energy. This has been speculatively sug- 
gested many times before, in order to allow the Creator to be con- 
tinually on his job. Here is, perhaps, a little bit of experimental 
finger-pointing in that direction. But it is not at all proved or even 



ATOMIC DISIiSTTEGEATION MILLIKAlsr 285 

perhaps necessarily suggested. If Sir James Jeans prefers to hold 
one view and I another on this question, no one can say us nay. 
The one thing of which wo may all be quite sure is that neither of 
us knows anything about it. But for the continuous building up of 
the common elements out of hydrogen in the depths of interstellar 
space the cosmic raj's furnish considerable experimental evidence. I 
am not unaware of the difficulties of finding an altogether satisfactory 
kinetic picture of how these events take place, but acceptable and 
demonstrable facts do not, in this twentieth century, seem to be dis- 
posed to wait on suitable mechanical pictures. Indeed, has not mod- 
ern physics thrown the purely mechanistic view of the universe root 
and brancli out of its house? 



ASSAULT ON ATOMS 



By Arthub H. Compton 



[With 2 plates] 



Twenty-five hundred years ago, Thales, the first true scientist of 
ancient Greece, undertook to solve the problem, " Of what and how 
is the world made? " Almost a hundred generations have passed and 
the problem is not yet solved. 

Democritus and his followers thought they had found the solution. 
Everj'thing is made of atoms. "According to convention there is a 
sweet and a bitter, a hot and a cold, and according to convention 
there is color. In truth there are atoms and a void." Thus, in terms 
of motions of minute particles the ancient Atomists accounted for 
their world. Mountains and seas, trees and people, even life and 
thoughts, were thus explained. 

But Socrates and Plato would have none of their atoms. Did they 
not in Democritus' hands rob men of their personality? Atoms are 
thus worse than useless, for they destroy the basis of morality. Here 
in Athens, around the question of atoms, was staged the first great 
battle between science and religion. Epicurus and Lucretius took 
up the cudgels on behalf of the atomists, but Plato carried the day, 
and atoms were forgotten until the revival of scientific thought dur- 
ing the Renaissance. Though our present day atouiic theories are 
based on much firmer foundations than those of Democritus, they 
owe their origin to his ideas, transmitted down through the 
centuries. 

A few 3'ears ago we were camped beside a mountain lake in the 
foothills of the Himalayas, studying cosmic rays. The warm air 
from the plains of India was carried up over a range of mountains, 
and came down again into the beautiful Vale of Kashmir. Clouds 
were continuall}^ forming as the air, cooled by expansion as it came 
up the mountain side, became supersaturated with moisture. But 
after passing the peak of the range, the air was warmed by com-

pression as it sank to lower levels, and tlie clouds evaporated into 
thin air. 

It was while watching such clouds in his native hills of Scotland 
that C. T. R. Wilson conceived his beautiful laboratory experiments 
on clouds. Of course he couldn't bring the mountains into his 
laboratory, but he could expand his moist air in a cylinder with a 
piston at one end. He made his cylinder of glass in order to see 
what was going on. I have one patterned after his design here in 
my hand. Here are the glass top and sides, with the whole vessel 
partially filled with inky water. There is a lamp beside the glass 
cylinder so we can see better what is going on. I can compress the 
air in the glass chamber by squeezing the bulb. We let the air 
remain under this pressure for a moment, until it becomes saturated 
with moisture, and then allow it to expand. As it expands the air 
cools and a cloud forms in the chamber just as it did on the moun- 
tain top. 

Did it ever occur to you that, when a cloud forms, each little drop 
of moisture in the cloud must condense on something? Usually it 
condenses on a speck of dust floating in the air, and after a rain- 
storm these dust particles are carried to the ground and the air is 
beautifully clear. But when the dust has been removed, what can 
the drops condense on? There are always in the air some broken 
bits of atoms and molecules, which we call ions. These ions are 
produced by rays from radioactive substances in the ground and 
other sources. So, Mr. Wilson tried the experiment of placing a 
speck of radium in his expansion chamber, to see what kind of 
clouds would be formed. Let's see what happens when we repeat 
his experiment. Those of you who are near enough will see the little 
white lines radiating out from the tip of the glass rod which carries 
the radium. These little white lines are tiny clouds of water drops, 
condensed on the ions left along the paths of particles shot out by 
the radium. It is clear that particles of some kind are coming from 
the radium. What are they? 

A series of photographs will illustrate what is happening in this 
chamber. A picture taken from above (pi. 1, fig. 1) shows the 
glass walls of the chamber, and the rod on which the speck of 
radium is placed. The more or less diffuse lines are the clouds of 
water drops that mark the paths of the particles ejected from the 
radium. 

What are these particles? Let us call them alpha particles, in 
order not to imply anything about what they are, and look into 
their properties. Plate 1, Figure 2, shows a sharper photograph, 
each line a thin straight cloud, marking the path of an alpha par- 
ticle. Rutherford (recently made Lord Rutherford in recognition 



ASSAULT ON ATOMS — COMPTON" 289 

of his work with atoms) caught a large number of these particles 
to find out what they were Avhen there are enough of them to handle. 
Niton is a radio-active gas, a hundred thousand times as active as 
radium. He compressed some of this gas into a fine glass tube with 
walls so thin that the alpha particles would pass right through. 
After a few days he noticed gas collecting in the space surrounding 
this tube, and this gas he forced into a fine tube above. On passing 
an electric discharge through the tube and looking through a spectro- 
scope at the light emitted, he saw the brilliant spectrum characteris- 
tic of the gas helium. 

Many of you know the romance of helium. Observed many years 
ago by Lockyer in the spectrum of the sun, it remained unknown 
on the earth for a generation until Rayleigh and Ramsay, making 
a i^recise measurement of the density of the nitrogen in the air, 
found it different from the nitrogen prepared in the laboratory. 
Search for the cause of the discrepancy revealed a whole series of 
new gases — argon with which our incandescent lamps are filled, neon 
with which we advertise our wares in blazing red, helium with which 
we now fill our dirigibles, and two others, krypton and xenon, which 
are now of great value in certain laboratory experiments. Thus was 
helium found, and here we see it being formed — the birth of helium 
atoms. For these alpha particles are none other than atoms of 
helium gas. 

We can count these atoms one by one as they come from a prepara- 
tion of radium. It might be done using an expansion chamber of 
this type, and counting the tracks as they appear. A better method 
is to allow the atoms to enter an electrical counting chamber. Each 
particle then can make its record on a moving film, as we see in 
Plate 1, Figure 3. Every little peak here marks the birth of a helium 
atom from its parent radium. 

Imagine that we have thus counted all the atoms of helium that 
come through the walls of Rutherford's glass tube, and make the 
gas that he observed in his spectroscope. How many atoms would 
we have? In a little glass bulb the size of a large pea, filled with 
helium at atmosphere pressure, the number of atoms is about 1 
with 19 ciphers after it. Perhaps that doesn't mean much to you. 
Let me put it this way. Two thousand years ago Julius Caesar gave 
a dying gasp, " Et tu Brute?" In the intervening millenniums the 
molecules of air that he breathed out with that cry have been blown 
around the world in ocean storms, washed with rains, warmed by 
the sunshine, and dispersed to the ends of the earth. Of course only 
a very small fraction of these molecules are now in this room ; but 
at your next breath each of you will probably inhale half a dozen or 
so of the molecules of Caesar's last breath. 



290 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

Molecules and atoms are very tiny things; but there are so many 
of them that they make up the world in which we live. 

The story is told of Lord Kelvin, a famous Scotch physicist of the 
last century, that after he had given a lecture on atoms and mole- 
cules, one of his students came to him with the question, " Professor, 
what is your idea of the structure of the atom ? " " What," said 
Kelvin, "the structure of the atom? Why, don't you know, the 
very word ' atom ' means the thing that can't be cut. How, then, 
can it have a structure? " 

" That," remarks the facetious young man, " shows the disad- 
vantage of knowing Greek." 

Does the atom have parts ? 

THE ELECTRON 

Do 3^ou see the faint little trail at the bottom of Plate 1, Figure 4? 
It appears to be due to something much smaller than the particle 
which made the broad bright trail above it. If we called the one 
an alpha particle, let us call the other a beta particle, and try to find 
out what kind of thing it is. 

Plate 1, Figure 5 shows a large number of these beta particles, 
that have been knocked out of air molecules by the action of X rays. 
You can see where the X rays passed through the middle of the 
chamber. Now every substance has its own peculiar kind of atoms. 
Iron atoms differ from oxygen atoms, and these from atoms of 
carbon and so on. But these beta particles are all alike, as far as we 
can tell, and they can be knocked out of anything. Had we put into 
the chamber fried eggs or a platinum wrist watch, the same kind of 
beta particles would have been observed. Thus beta particles are 
things which go to make up all kinds of matter. They are more 
fundamental even than atoms. 

But what are these beta particles? In the first place they carry 
an electric charge. Notice in Plate 2, Figure 1 how their trails 
are curled up if a magnet is held near the expansion chamber. This 
is because the moving electric charge acts like a wire carrying an 
electric current, and the particles form the armatures of tiny electric 
motors. 

Professor Millikan, a member of our society, spent years at the 
University of Chicago in measuring the charge carried by one of 
these little particles. He built himself an electroscope in which a 
tiny drop of oil took the place of the usual gold leaf, and he would 
catch these beta particles on his oil drop. Every particle carried 
the same charge, he found. It was also the same charge that a 
hydrogen ion carries when water is dissociated into oxygen and 
hydrogen by the passage of an electric current. 



ASSAULT ON ATOMS COMPTON 291 

Because it carries this unit of electric charge, which seems to be an 
indivisible unit, these beta particles were called electrons^ and by 
that name they have become familiar. 

These electrons have been weighed, too, and their weight is found 
to be very small indeed. The atom of hydrogen is the smallest atom 
we know, and as we have seen, it is a very tiny thing. But an elec- 
tron weighs only 1/1845 as much as does a hydrogen atom. Thus 
we were correct in guessing that the beta particle which made the 
faint trail was much smaller than the alpha particle that made the 
broad bright streak on an earlier photograph. 

The electron is indeed one of the components of which the atom is 
built. We can in fact count the number of electrons that each atom 
has. Hydrogen has 1 electron, helium 2, lithium 3, and so on. Oxy- 
gen has 8 electrons in each atom, iron 26, and uranium, the heaviest 
atom of all, has 92 electrons. 

THE NUCLEUS AND THE PROTON 

But this is only a part of the story. The electrons are all par- 
ticles of negative electricity. The atom itself is electrically neutral, 
and must therefore have in it some positive electricity to neutralize 
the negative electrons. If time were available, I should describe for 
you the beautiful experiments carried out by Rutherford and Aston 
in Cambridge, Dempster at the University of Chicago, and others, 
which have shown that this positive electricity is concentrated in a 
very small nucleus, which though much smaller in size that the atom 
has yet nearly all the atom's weight. 

The careful experiments of Dempster and Aston have shown that 
the weights of the nuclei of the various atoms, such as oxygen, nitro- 
gen, sodium, and the rest, are whole multiples of a unit which is 
nearly equal to the weight of the hydrogen nucleus. This suggested 
that the various atomic nuclei are built up of hydrogen nuclei. This 
idea was supported by the fact that the electric charge carried by 
the various atomic nuclei is always an integral multiple of the 
charge carried by hydrogen nucleus. 

Many attempts have been made to make one element out of an- 
other. This is in fact the old problem of alchemy, to make gold out 
of lead. The first success was got by Rutherford. He didn't get 
gold out of lead ; but he did get hydrogen out of nitrogen and out of 
aluminum and other elements. 

The experiment can best be shown using again our cloud expan- 
sion apparatus, as has been done for example by our fellow member, 
Professor Harkins. Plate 2, Figure 2 shows a group of alpha 
particles shooting through nitrogen gas. Most of them go straight 
102992—32 20 



292 ANNUAL, EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

to the end of the path, and this is remarkable, for each alpha passes 
right through tens of thousands of nitrogen atoms before its flight 
is stopped. But here we see a really surprising occurrence. The 
alpha particle dives into a nitrogen atom, and out of it emerges a 
smaller particle, which goes out leaving a thin straight trail. The 
nitrogen nucleus with the alpha particle now attached moves heavily 
along in a different direction. The alpha particle has served as a 
hammer to knock a hj^drogen nucleus out of a nitrogen atom. 

Similar experiments have been done with- many other elements, 
and most of the lighter ones have thus been disintegrated, expelling 
always a hydrogen nucleus. Thus we may take this nucleus, like the 
electron, as a component of which the various atoms are built. We 
give to the hydrogen nucleus now the name of proton^ i. e., the origi- 
nal or fundamental thing. Out of protons and electrons we believe 
all the 92 different kinds of atoms are built. 

HOW THE ATOM IS BUILT 

Old Ptolemy, the ancient Greek astronomer, knew that there was 
a sun and a moon, the earth, and the planets, but he didn't know 
what the solar sj'stem is. When Copernicus and Galileo showed, 
however, that there is a sun, around which revolve planets in definite 
orbits, then men felt that they had become acquainted with their 
world. So, though we have found the parts of which the atom is 
made, we really don't know the atom until we know how these parts 
are put together. 

Perhaps the best way to find out how something is made is to 
look at it. If it is something like a watch, which we can hold in 
our hands, this is comparatively easy. If it is the cell structure 
of a muscle that we wish to examine, we put it under a microscope. 
But some things are too small to see, even in a microscope. By using 
ultra-violet light of wave length shorter than ordinary light, we can 
photograph such things as typhoid bacilli with increased sharpness. 
But atoms are too small even for this. 

Now, X rays have a wave length onh'' a ten-thousandth that of 
light, and if we could use them in a microscope it should be pos- 
sible for us to observe even the tiny atoms. Unfortunatel3% we can 
not make lenses that will refract X rays, and even if we could, 
our eyes are not sensitive to X rays. So it would seem that we 
shall never be able to see an atom directly. 

It is nevertheless possible for us in the laborator}" to get by more 
round-about methods precisely the same information about an atom 
that we should if we could look at it with an X-ray microscope. 
I have spent a large part of the last 16 years trying to find what 
the atom looks like, and it has become something of a game with me. 



ASSAULT ON ATOMS COMPTON" 293 

Last summer while spending a brief vacation in northern Mich- 
igan, I noticed a fuzzy ring, not very hirge, around the moon. Half 
an hour later the ring was perceptibly smaller, and within an hour 
we had to come in out of the rain. 

This ring was due to the diffraction of the moonlight by tiny 
water droplets that were begimiing to form a cloud. The size of 
the ring depends upon the size of the water drops — if the drops are 
small, the ring is big, and vice versa. So when the ring grew smaller 
it meant that the drops were growing larger. Soon they would fall 
as rain. 

Our method of studying atoms is very similar to this method of 
finding out the size of the droplets in a cloud. Instead of the moon 
we use an X-ray tube, and in place of the cloud of water droplets 
we use the atoms in air or helium. For the wave length of the X 
rays bears about the same ratio to the size of a helium atom that 
a light wave bears to a droplet of water in a fog. The helium atoms 
spread the X rays out into a halo. This halo, now of X rays scat- 
tered by the helium atoms, corresponds precisely to the ring around 
the moon diffracted by the cloud droplets. Likewise here, from the 
diameter of this halo, we can estimate the size of the helium atom. 
We can also tell pretty much what it looks like, just as if the atom 
were under the microscope. 

Plate 2, Figure 3, shows how the helium atom would look if we 
were to see it with an X-ray microscope. The picture is drawn 
carefully from the data we have got from the diffraction halos. 
Of course, it is highly magnified, about a thousand million times. 
Such a magnification would make a pea appear as big as the earth. 

In the middle of this fuzzy ball somewhere is the nucleus of the 
helium atom, which has in it the protons. This fuzzy atmosphere is 
due to the electrons. We noted above that the helium atom has only 
two electrons in it. You may wonder how with only two electrons 
the atom can seem so diffuse. Did you ever see the boys on the 
Fourth of July waving the sparklers to make circles or figures eight? 
Of course the sparklers weren't in the form of circles ; they appeared 
that way because they moved so fast. So here, the electrons give this 
continuous, diffuse appearance to the atom because they are now 
here and now there, and we have caught a "time exposure " of tlieir 
average positions. This is, of course, what we would see if we could 
look at the atom. 

There have been 57 varieties of atomic theories proposed. Lord 
Kelvin thought the atom was something like a smoke ring; J. J. 
Thomson said it was a sphere of jelly. Rutherford called it a 
miniature solar system, while Bohr and Sommerfeld calculated pre- 



294 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAlSr INSTITUTION, 1931 

cisely the orbits of the planetary electrons revolving about the central 
nucleus. Lewis and Langmuir objected, and said the atom is a cube. 
" Not so, it's a tetrahedron," claimed Lande. " Quite a mistake ; it's 
a diffuse atmosphere of electricity around a central core," says 
Schrodinger. " Only it isn't diffuse electricity," complains Heisen- 
berg, " It's electrons moving now here, now there, which make up this 
atmosphere." 

Each of these theories has found support in that it has explained 
certain physical or chemical or spectroscopic properties of atoms. 
For the most part, each theory has been better than the one before, 
because it has explained the things which the earlier one described 
and some new thing as well. It may seem over-optimistic to suppose 
that there is anything final about the most recent theory. Yet the 
fact remains that there is one and only one such picture, namely, 
that of Heisenberg, that describes what we find when with our 
" X-ray eyes " we look into the atom. 

Does this mean that the problem of the structure of the atom is 
solved ? Not yet ! We feel that we know in general outline what 
this electron atmosphere of the atom is like ; but there's the nucleus 
of the atom. What is it like ? 

" What's the idea of bringing that up ? " you ask me. " Surely 
that little nucleus isn't big enough to amount to anything ! " 

It is the nucleus of the radium atom from which the alpha par- 
ticles came. Did it occur to you that those alpha particles carry a 
tremendous amount of energy ? It is about a million times as much 
as is released when a molecule of TNT explodes. It is only be- 
cause they are liberated one at a time that the alpha particles make 
so little impression. 

Did you ever pause to wonder where all the energy of the sun 
comes from which it is pouring out as heat? If it were made of 
pure coal burning in oxygen, the sun could shine with its present 
brilliance for only a few thousand years, less than the era of his- 
tory, before it would be reduced to a cinder. Even if it were com- 
posed of uranium or radium, and got its heat from their disintegra- 
tion, it would last only for a few billion years, which is about the 
age of our own earth ; yet our geological records indicate no change 
in the sun's brightness over this vast period. The best astronomical 
evidence indicates that the sun must be at least a thousand billion 
years old. What is the enormous supply of energy which has kept 
it hot for so long a time? Professor McMillan has pointed out that 
apparently the only way to explain the sun's long life is to suppose 
that the sun is consuming itself. If under the extreme pressure 
and temperature of the sun's interior the electrons and protons in 
an atom should come together and neutralize each other, all of their 



ASSAULT OlSr 4T0MS COMPTON 295 

energy would be liberated and add to the sun's heat. Such a proc- 
ess would release energy almost beyond belief. From five drops of 
water, if we could thus squeeze out all the energy, we should be 
able to run all the ^^ower stations in Philadelphia for 24 hours. 

Is it possible for man to tap these great stores of energ}'? We 
do not know. We know the energy is there, and the evidence is 
strong that it is being liberated in the sun and stars. But under 
what conditions? Perhaps we can not realize the proper conditions 
here on the earth. In any case it is our job — the physicists' job, 
that is — to find out whether this energy can be used, and, if so, how. 

If we are to find the conditions for the release of these vast stores 
of energy, we must acquaint ourselves with the atomic nucleus, for 
it is there that the energy lies. Studies of the band spectra of mole- 
cules have shown us something about the rotation of the nucleus. 
The masses of the nuclei and their electric charges have been 
measured by the help of magnetic spectrographs and scattered 
X rays. Attempts have been made to disintegrate atomic nuclei by 
bombardment with high speed electrons shot by high voltages. But 
by far the most fruitful tool for studying the nucleus has been 
radioactivity. 

Experiments with scattered alpha rays have shown the minute 
size and relatively large mass of the nucleus. They have enabled us 
to measure its charge and even to estimate the field of electric force 
in its neighborhood. Further information on the latter point is given 
by the speed with which the alpha particles are ejected from the 
radioactive nucleus. Combining the evidence from these alpha ray 
experiments, it becomes evident that surrounding the nucleus there 
is a " potential wall " which prevents alpha particles that are outside 
from entering the nucleus and those on the inside from escaping. We 
are thus afforded a basis for developing a quantum theory of radio- 
active disintegration according to which the probability of an alpha 
particle jumping this wall is greater if it has large energy, and a 
qualitative explanation of one of the fundamental laws of radioac- 
tivity is obtained. Studies of the sharpness of gamma ray lines 
suggest a nucleus in which planetary alpha particles correspond to 
the electrons of the outer atom ; though how these particles are held 
together remains unknown. Similarly the condition, of the electrons 
in the nucleus remains unsolved. There is no gamma radiation that 
can be traced to these electrons, and when they appear as beta par- 
ticles their energies are distributed over broad bands. Though much 
new light is shed by these studies in radioactivity, the nucleus of 
the atom, with its hoard of energy, thus continues to present us with 
a fascinating mystery. 



296 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

Thus our assault on atoms has broken down the outer fortifications. 
We feel that we know the fundamental rules according to which the 
outer part of the atom is built. The appearance and properties of 
the electron atmosphere are rather familiar. Yet that inner citadel, 
the atomic nucleus, remains unconquered, and we have reason to 
believe that within this citadel is secreted a great treasure. Its cap- 
ture may form the main objective of the physicists' next great drive.

TWO-WAY TELEVISION 



By Hi'jiuERT E. Ives 
Electro-Optical Research Director, Bell Telephone Laboratories 



[With 6 plates] 



Ever since the initial demonstration of television both by wire and 
by radio at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1927, experimental work 
has been steadily pursued in order to learn the problems and the 
possibilities of this newest branch of electrical communication. The 
latest development to be demonstrated is that of two-way television 
as an adjunct to the telephone. As a result of our development 
work, there is now ^ set up an experimental and demonstration system 
between the headquarters building of the American Telephone & 
Telegraph Co. at 195 Broadway and the building of the Bell Tele- 
phone Laboratories at 463 West Street, New York City, 2 miles 
away. This system makes it possible to experiment with a method 
of communication in which the parties engaged not only speak with 
each other but at the same time see each other. Study of this 
system will serve to give information on the importance of the 
addition of sight to sound in communication and will give valuable 
experience in handling the technical problems involved. 

In principle the 2-way television system consists of two complete 
systems of the same sort as those used for 1-way transmission in the 
demonstration from Washington to New York City in 1927. In 
place of a scanning disk and set of photo-electric cells at one end 
for generating the television signals and a single disk and neon lamp 
at the receiving end for viewing the image, there are in the 2-way 
system two disks at each end and a bank of photo-electric cells 
and a neon lamp at each end. One of the disks, which in the sys- 
tem as constructed, is of 21-inch diameter, serves to direct the scan- 
ning beam from an arc lamp onto the face of one of the parties 
to the conversation. Three banks of photo-electric cells, making 12 
in all, are arranged at either side and above the person's face and 
serve to pick up the reflected light and generate the television signals.

The second disk, which is 30 inches in diameter, is placed below 
the sending disk and exposes through its holes the neon lamp, which 
the observer sees through a magnifying lens in a position slightly 
below that of the scanning beam. This neon lamp is, of course, 
actuated by the signals coming in from the distant end of the 
system, where there is a similar arrangement of two disks, photo- 
electric cells, and neon lamp. 

The two parties to the conversation take their places in sound- 
proof and light-proof booths, where, sitting in front of the photo- 
electric cells, they look at the image of the person at the other end

FiGUKE 1. — Two-way television is essentially the same in principle as the television 
demonstrated three years ago. A beam of light from an arc light is thrown by a 
scanning disk on the speaker's face, and reflected light is picked up by photoelectric 
cells and transmitted electrically to the distant end. The incoming image is seen 
by means of the lower scanning disk and a neon tube. A concealed microphone and 
loud speaker act as speech terminal elements to complete the television-telephone 
system 

at the same time that the scanning beam plaj^s over their faces. A 
problem of illumination is immediately encountered in that the 
scanning beam is of necessity intensely bright and tends to dazzle 
the eyes to the extent that the somewhat faint neon lamp image is 
hard to see. This difficulty is met by using light for scanning to 
which the photo-electric cells are extremely sensitive, but to which 
the human eye is relatively insensitive, that is, blue light. By inter- 
posing a filter in the path of the scanning beam, the spot of light in 
the lens which projects it is seen as a blue disk of light not bright 
enough to interfere with clear vision of the neon lamp which 
provides the image of the person located at the distant end. 



TELEVISION IVES 299 

In our original demonstrations of 1-way television, scanning disks 
were used which had 50 holes arranged in a spiral. With this num- 
ber of holes it is possible to secure a definitely recognizable repre- 
sentation of the human face. It was decided, however, that for the 
2-way system a degree of definition should be provided such that 
faces were rendered in an entirely recognizable and satisfactory man- 
ner. Accordingly the number of scanning holes has been increased 
to 72, which provides just twice the number of image elements. 
The transmission band is, of course, doubled by this change, requir- 
ing wire connections of considerably higher quality than heretofore. 
"When a 72-hole scanning disk is used, the component frequencies of 
the image signal encompass a range of from 10 cycles to 40,000 
cycles per second, whereas intelligible speech ma}^ be reproduced by 
a signal wave whose component frequencies cover a range of 2,500 
cycles per second. This comparison indicates roughly how much 
more difficult it is to transmit high-quality television images than 
it is to transmit ordinar}^ speech. In general the electrical features 
of the apparatus are similar to those previously used, although in the 
interval improvements and refinements have been made in many 
directions. 

Light reflected into the photo-electric cells gives rise to an alter- 
nating electric current whose effective value is of the order of a 
ten-thousand-millionth ampere. The neon glow lamp on which the 
image is received at the distant station reproduces the image satis- 
factorily when the effective value of the alternating current is of 
the order of one-tenth ampere. This thousand-millionfold increase 
in current variation, considerably greater than required for the 
earlier 1-way system, is effected by amplifiers in which the vacuum 
tubes are coupled by condensers and resistances. The tubes, which 
operate at low energy levels, are shielded against electrical, mechani- 
cal, and acoustical interference. 

For the transmission of images between 463 West Street and 195 
Broadway, the appropriate stages of the amplifier systems are cou- 
pled by special transformers to telephone cable circuits equipped 
with special distortion corre'cting networks which are capable of 
transmitting the extremely complex current variations without dis- 
tortion. The amounts of distortion inherent in other parts of the 
system are either kept small by design or annulled by means of cor- 
recting networks. 

An indispensable part of a television system is the means for hold- 
ing several scanning disks accurately at the same speed. For the 
2-way television system, a simplified and improved synchronizing 
arrangement is used. The disks at the receiving and transmitting 
ends, which rotate at a speed of 18 revolutions per second, are 



300 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

synchronized by means of a vacuum tube oscillator located at one 
end of the line and delivering a frequency of 1,275 cycles per sec- 
ond at a low-power level. This frequency is transmitted over a 
separate pair of wires. At the receiving end this frequency, through 
vacuum tube means, controls the field strength of the motor and 
thereby holds its speed exactly proportional to the frequency. In 
the same way, the speed of the motor at the transmitting end is 
controlled by a similar vacuum tube circuit so that its speed is also 
proportional to the frequency of the same oscillator, and thus the 
motors driving the scanning disks at both ends of the line are held 
in synchronism. By using a frequency of 1,275 cycles per second, 
the degree of synchronization is held within sufficiently close limits to 
keep the picture at the receiving end central within its frame within 
a small fraction of the picture width. Novel features of this syn- 
chronizing system are the use of mechanically damping couplings 
between the disks and the motor shafts to improve the steadiness of 
the image, and of an electrical phase shifter for framing the images. 

The acoustic portion of the 2-way television system is unusual 
in that it permits simultaneous 2-way conversation without re- 
quiring either person to make any apparent use of telephone in- 
struments. It is obviously desirable to arrange the acoustic system 
in this way because the ordinary telephone instrument conceals part 
of the face and would thus prevent the system from approximating 
to the conditions of ordinary face-to-face conversation. The elimi- 
nation of telephone instruments is accomplished by the use of a 
microphone sensitive to remote sounds and a loud speaker concealed 
near the television image at each station. The microphone at one 
station is connected through suitable vacuum-tube amplifiers and a 
telephone circuit to the loud speaker at the other station. This 
permits conversation in one direction while a similar connection 
between the other microphone and loud speaker permits conversa- 
tion in the other direction. The persons using the system then 
communicate as if face to face and with no telephone system appar- 
ently involved. 

In order that the transmitted sounds be familiar and natural, dis- 
tortion in the sound-transmission system has been reduced to a 
minimum. The microphones are of the condenser type used exten- 
sively in radio broadcasting and sound-picture recording. Being of 
small size, they are readily concealed near the television image in 
the most advantageous position for picking up the voice. The loud 
speaker, also of small size but capaljle of reproducing a broad fre- 
quency range, is likewise concealed near the television image, so 
that the sounds produced appear to emanate from the image itself. 



TELEVISION IVES 301 

This loud sj)eaker is of the moving coil type with a small piston 
diaphragm. 

In any system such as that described, the microphone is not capable 
of distinguishing between the sounds from the local speaker or from 
a speaker at the remote end of the circuit reproduced locally by the 
local loud sjjeaker. If the sounds from the local loud speaker 
should be impressed upon the local microphone in sufficient magni- 
tude, " singing " would result, and the system be no longer operable. 
To prevent this the microphone and the loud speaker are installed 
in carefully chosen positions and the inner surfaces of the sound- 
proof booths are specially treated to prevent as much as possible 
the reflection of sounds from the walls into the microphone. Under 
these conditions, the attenuation of sounds transmitted is of about 
the same magnitude as would be experienced if the listener were, 
say, 10 or 12 feet away, but in the same room. This acoustic illusion 
of distance is in harmony with the visual appearance of the television 
image. 

In addition to the television synchronizing and acoustic circuits, 
others are provided for signaling and monitoring purposes. Matters 
are so arranged that an operator can see both the outgoing and in- 
coming image, and by means of movable lens and prism systems 
can insure that the scanning beam is properly directed to correspond 
to the height of the observer, and that the magnifying lens in front 
of the receiving disk directs the image to the observer's eyes. 

Operating arrangements are made so that the two parties to the 
conversation, after taking their positions in the booths, do not see 
or hear each other until adjustments are made, whereupon the 
operators expose the images and connect the talking circuits simul- 
taneously. The experimental service is arranged on an appointment 
basis. The two parties to the conversation, having arranged with 
attendants at the two stations for their time, proceed to the respective

KESEARCH CORPORATION AWARDS TO A. E. DOUG- 
LASS AND ERNST ANTEVS FOR RESEARCHES IN 
CHRONOLOGY 



(Presentation at Smithsonian Institution, Washington, December 18, 1931) 



REMARKS OF DR. C. G. ABBOT, 
Secretary, Smithsonian Institution 

Mr. Chief Justice, Ladies and Gentlemen : The Research Corporation of 
New Yorlv is probably the only organization of its kind in existence. It sprang 
from the desire of a scientist to have the fruit of his scientific labors capitalized 
for the promotion of research. In 1911 Dr. Frederick G. Cottrell, then chief 
physical chemist, later director, of the United States Bureau of Mines, and his 
associates offered their invention for the electrical precipitation of suspended 
particles to the Smithsonian Institution for the benefit of science. As the Insti- 
tution could not well undertake the development of a matter so likely to have 
commercial and legal complications, Dr. Charles D. Walcott, then Secretary of 
the Smithsonian, undertook with Doctor Cottrell to enlist the aid of public- 
spirited men of Boston and New York City to organize a nonprofit-sharing cor- 
poration for the development of the patents, and in 1912 the Research Corpora- 
tion was formed. 

Its purposes are to acquire inventions and patents and make them more avail- 
able in the arts and industries, while using them as a source of income, and, 
second, to apply all profits from such use to the advancement of technical and 
scientific investigation and experimentation. The Research Corporation has 
succeeded financially so that it has built up a reserve and given large funds to 
scientific work. Among grants made by the corporation are several to the 
Smithsonian Institution for work on solar radiation and its influence on plants 
and animals ; to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research, at Heidel- 
berg, to carry on cancer research ; to the International Auxiliary Language 
Association for linguistic research ; to Harvard University, Columbia University, 
Leland Stanford Junior University, Pennsylvania State College, and the Stevens 
Institute of Technology, in support of various projects. A grant was made to 
the National Research Council to assist in the publication of one of the volumes 
of the " International Critical Tables." A recent grant has been made to the 
University of California to make possible the installation of an 85-ton magnet, 
through which it is hoped to promote the study of atomic structure. 

As the charter of the Research Corporation provides that its awards shall bo 
made through scientific institutions, the directors have seen fit in this instance 
to make their awards to Messrs. Douglass and Antevs through the Smithsonian 
Institution. These awards were voted as of the fiscal year 1930. 

The awards to Doctor Douglass and Doctor Antevs are the fourth and fifth 
of their kind made by the Research Corporation. The first, in 1925, went to 

303 



304 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

Dr. John J. Abel, of the Johns Hopkins University, for his work on ductless 
glands, animal tissues, and fluids. The second, in 1929, went to Dr. Werner 
Heisenberg, of the University of Leipzig, for his contribution to matrix mechan- 
ics and for his exposition of the principle of indeterminance ; and the third, 
also in 1929, to Dr. Bergen Davis, of Columbia University, for the contribution 
of the Davis double X-ray spectrometer and other brilliant achievements in the 
field of atomic physics. 

It is indeed a pleasure to have the Research Corporation represented on this 
platform by its president, Mr. Poillon, and by its founder, Doctor Cottrell, and 
to have the Smithsonian Institution represented by its chancellor, the Hon. 
Charles Evans Hughes, Chief Justice of the United States, who will now present 
the awards. 

[After extemporaneous remarks by Mr. Elon Hooker, a director 
and past president of the Research Corporation, Doctor Abbot 
continued] : 

I have the honor, ladies and gentlemen, to present Chief Justice Charles 
Evans Hughes. 

REMARKS OF CHIEF JUSTICE CHARLES EVANS HUGHES 
Chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution 

DocTOB Douglass : You have been diligently engaged for nearly 30 years in 
making exact measurements of conditions of former centuries as they stand 
recorded in the growth of ancient trees. You have pursued these studies in 
many lands. You have devised ingenious instruments to further your re- 
.searches. Your work has been crowned with success in several directions. 
You have found evidences of periodicities in weather which seem to imply cor- 
responding periodicities in the radiation of the sun. You have established an 
exact chronology for more than a thousand years, thus dating the prehistoric 
culture of the Indians of the Southwest from the timber rings of their habi- 
tations. 

In recognition of these achievements, the Research Corporation of New York 
has awarded to you through tlie Smithsonian Institution a grant of $2,500. In 
token of this award, I now, as chancellor of that Institution, hand you this 
commemorative medal, and wish for you equal success in your future researches. 

TREE RINGS AND THEIR RELATION TO SOLAR VARIATIONS AND 

CHRONOLOGY 

By A. E. Douglass, University of Arizona 

[With 5 plates] 

The studies of tree rings described in this paj^er touch closely upon 
several major sciences. This is because annual rings, like annual 
varves, measure the passage of years, and time is a prime considera- 
tion in all branches of knowledge. Hence we find ourselves at once

making contact- with botany and its associated sciences, with meteor- 
ology, and especially climatology and astronomy ; with anthropology, 
geology, and mathematics. 

At the outset I wish gratefully to acknowledge my obligation to 
the Carnegie Institution for its important support of these clima- 
tological studies since 1915. Especial thanks are expressed here to 
the National Geographic Society, through whose valued assistance 
the archeological material lias been obtained, which has carried south- 
western climatic and historic records back to TOO A. D. The Amer- 
ican Museum of Natural History assisted in the first collection of 
prehistoric material. The Museum of Northern Arizona has given 
great help in field work and laboratory space; C. G. White gave 
funds for building the cyclograph ; the University of Arizona has 
helped fundamentally by reducing teaching obligations; and now 
the Kesearch Corporation of New York, through the Smithsonian 
Institution, has contributed its generous and highly appreciated 
award, for which encouragement I hereby express my sincere 
gratitude. 

ORIGIN OF RESEARCHES 

Tlie stud}^ of tree rings began in 1001 as an astronomical investi- 
gation based on the hypothesis that the sun affects weather and 
weather affects trees, hence there is expectation of finding a history 
of sun-spot variations in the annual rings of trees. This is especially 
likely in a cool, dry climate like that of northern Arizona, where 
moisture is vital to all vegetation and where winter gives annually 
an emphatic resting period in the life of each tree. By 1913 precise 
dating of rings had been established and a new method of analysis 
had disclosed long-continued sequences of what ap})eared to be the 
11-year solar cycle in the pines of Arizona. The failure of this 
sequence from about 1G70 to 1720 caused serious questioning of its 
reality. The results, however, were published in 1919, with mention 
of this failure. But three jeavs later Dr. E. Walter Maunder, of 
the Royal Observator}^, Greenwich, communicated his work on the 
historical study of sun spots, from which he deduced a great dearth 
of them from 1C45 to 1715. This dearth coincides closely with the 
faihire of tlie trees to show this cycle. 

While this cycle in the Arizona pines was evident and sometimes 
conspicuous, it was accompanied by other cycles, often of equal and 
sometimes of superior importance. For years this was puzzling and 
it was only in the end of 1926 that the possible relation of these other 
cycles to the sun-spot cycle was discovered, as will be mentioned 
below. 



306 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN" INSTITUTION, 19 31 

FUNDAMENTALS 

In any study of tree rings, cross dating between different trees is 
of the first importance. This means the careful identification of 
each ring in different trees and the location and correction of all 
mistakes in each. Thus dates are carried from tree to tree and the 
exact year of growth of each ring is firmly established. Upon this 
depends directly the great precision in dating rings which many 
peoi^le, I am sure, fail to realize. 

But cross dating does more than this. A single tree tells its own 
story, which may contain accidental errors. But when many trees 
agree with each other in successive variations over long intervals 
of time, then some common factor which continuously influences the 
whole forest is emerging. It is safe to regard this as climatic in 
character. Pests and fires and falling trees are local or temporary 
and reveal their identity. High ridges, steep slopes, and bottom 
lands produce effects on trees, but such effects may be identified by 
comparison of trees in different surface conditions. Climate, with 
its story of limited change from year to year, is the factor which 
emerges when large numbers of trees are compared. 

As yet the interpretation of the story told by rings is only partly 
understood. A few very limited localities reveal their secrets. In 
northern Arizona and New Mexico, the semiarid pueblo area of the 
archeologists, conditions point rather clearly to rainfall as the con- 
trolling factor among the yellow pines, for that area includes the 
lower forest border which separates the successful forest from the 
deserts. Actual tests at Prescott on the western edge of this same 
lower border show a very close relationship between tree growth and 
rainfall. The similarity of growth curves in different portions of 
this border, hundreds of miles apart, is amazing. 

As one goes nearer the center of the forest the rings become less 
sensitive, that is, more complacent or equal in growth. The changes 
from ring to ring are less abrupt. At the uppermost limits of the 
forest, near 9,000 feet in elevation, the pines have lost the principal 
changes due to rainfall and have acquired other less marked varia- 
tions, doubtless largely dependent on temperature. It was the 
preference of the prehistoric Indians for locations on the lower and 
drier forest border which made the dating of their ruins much 
easier than might have happened. 

The giant Sequoia likewise has proved a tree of the greatest im- 
portance, for cross dating can be carried continuously through al- 
most every tree in all the groves. The rings are more complacent 
than those of the Arizona pines, but the sequences are so long that 
it is always possible to include and identify a number of telltale 



CHRONOLOGY DOUGLASS AND ANTEVS 307 

rings, which by their small size denote drought years. The coast 
redwood is less satisfactory, but is now receiving adequate study. 
Earlier groups of these important trees proved to be total failures 
in cross dating, but a personal inspection of the forests last summer 
showed at once that the lower parts of the trees are so subject to 
erratic growth from fires and wind strains that cross dating close 
to the stump, as is usually done, is utterly out of the question. How- 
ever, it was evident at once that higher portions of the trunk would 
be less subject to these injuries and we are actually now succeeding 
in cross dating between the tops of these trees. Yet, even so, they are 
not so easily dated as the species already mentioned. That could be 
due in part to their much divided allegiance, namely, to the rains 
of winter, the fogs of summer, and their almost continuous growing 
season throughout the year. 

Trees in north Germany cross date very readily; also trees at the 
Arctic Circle in north Sweden. The pines of central and southern 
Sweden do not match as well as hoped, but the spruces cross date 
accurately. It is logical to suppose that trees in southern Europe or 
northern Africa could be cross dated as in our corresponding lati- 
tudes here. Thus many points in widely separated parts of the 
northern and southern hemispheres are almost certain to give results 
that will supply valuable climatic information. There is no doubt 
that the interpretation of ring width in different climatic regions 
needs a vast amount of detailed study, including the establishment of 
meteorological stations within the forests chiefly concerned. 

While many regions give interlacing cycles apparently related to 
the 11-year cycle, certain regions give the 11-year variation without 
complications. The trees of north Europe, especially near the Baltic 
Sea, give a very perfect example of this since 1830 in curves whose 
maxima and minima coincide with those of the sun-spot numbers. 

CYCLE ANALYSIS 

Analysis of tree records has been done chiefly by the cyclograph 
process, which depends upon a pattern called the cyclogram, in which 
one can see at once not only the length but also the beginning and 
ending of each cycle, its steadiness or variability, its change of phase, 
its composition, and to a considerable extent its amplitude. 

The process could be described as an interference between an 
approximately perfect period engraved on glass in the form of 
parallel, equally spaced lines and the observed maxima extended into 
parallel bands by a cylindrical lens. These two systems of parallels 
are set at an angle of about 12° to each other. In the pattern pro- 
duced by the transmission of the latter through the former, the ob- 
102992—32 21 



308 ANNUAL KEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

served through the exact, different cycles appear in the form of 
interference bands in different directions, according to their length. 
Thus the cycles are automatically separated. Suitable range is se- 
cured by interposing a movable mirror between the curve and the 
lens and the cycle length may be read directly from the position of 
the mirror. 

The method has great rapidity and flexibility in cycle exploration 
and in the separation of mixed cycles. On several occasions 42 differ- 
ent curves averaging 175 units in length have in three hours been 
analyzed for all cycles between 5.5 and 40 units by one observer. 
The use of this method has led me to believe that harmonics or in- 
tegral parts of a fundamental are not suited to the expression of 
climatic cycles. Nor are we justified in assuming the sine curves 
that are used in harmonic analysis. 

CYCLES IN MODERN TREE GROWTH 

Some 52,000 measures have been made on 305 modern pines in the 
western United States. Their growth curves were divided into 42 
groups and analyzed. In the general summary the cycles appear 
in a great majority of cases to be simple fractions of two or three 
times the sun-spot cycle. This result, reached in 1926, was held to 
be of sufficient importance to make a complete and independent 
analytical check before publishing. 

Similar expressions have been reached by Abbot, Clayton, and 
C. E. P. Brooks. Thus, there seems support for the hypothesis that 
climatic cycles, which have shown such puzzling complexity, are 
related in a simple manner to the 11-year sun-spot cycle. One might 
suggest that this curious fractionizing process has something to do 
with interferences in any given locality between impulses coming 
from different centers of influence. Some recent evidence (Abbot's 
work on solar radiation and mine on analysis of monthly sun-spot 
numbers since 1750) points distinctly toward solar activity as offer- 
ing a clue to this fractionizing process. That does not lessen the 
complexity of terrestrial distribution. 

SEQUOIA CYCLES 

The longest tree records were found in the giant sequoias of Cali- 
fornia, Sequoia gigantea. About a dozen specimens in my laboratory 
have records that go back to about 200 B. C. At least four carry 
the record back to 1100 B. C, and one extends it to 1300 B. C. The 
sun-spot cycle appears to be recognizable in many parts of this 
record, especially if one searches for the double value of something 
over 22 years. This subdivides at different times into halves, thirds. 



CHRONOLOGY DOUGLASS AND ANTEVS 309 

quarters, and fifths. A cycle of approximately 100 years emerges 
in the longer records. Michelson considered that he found this 
cycle in the sun-spot numbers. 

CYCLES IN ARIZONA PINES 

The records of Arizona pines, Pinus fonder osa^ have been extended 
back in a continuous series to 700 A. D. by the aid of beams from 
prehistoric ruins. A preliminary examination of this sequence in- 
dicates well-developed long cycles of approximately 38 years and 
100 years nearly continuous through the interval, together with 
shorter cycles apparently related to the sun-spot cycle and one of 9.5 
or 19 years (doubtless related to the 38-year cycle just mentioned) . 

The " Hellmann relation " is the name tentatively given to the 
half sun-spot cycle having a length of about 5.5 years. It is pre- 
sumably an 11-year cycle with two maxima usuall.y unequal. This 
cycle was described and compared with the sun-spot cycle by Hell- 
mann in his study of the North German drainage area, published 
in 1908. It was observed by the speaker in 1908 in the California 
rainfall and in tree growth in Arizona at the same time. In 1912 
it was found in north European trees with one maximum often sup- 
pressed. About 1915 it was found highly developed in the Arizona 
trees during the century or more following 1420, and it is now 
recognized to extend in a slightly modified form from 1300 to 1650, 
and at other places. This is considered to form a basis for recon- 
structing the sun-spot curve during that interval and such an attempt 
is being made. This relation may easily be detected in recent Cali- 
fornia tree growth and rainfall. 

A shorter cycle somewhat over two years in length was noted in 
tree growth from the frequent occurrence of alternating sizes in suc- 
cessive rings. Such a cycle had been noted years before by Clayton, 
Arctowski, and others. From a study of rainfall near Windsor, 
Vt., published in 1915, this appeared to average about two and one- 
third years in length. The original cyclogram gives a suggestion of 
composite character, as if there were really two cycles, one about 
2.25 and the other about 2.55 yeare in length. 

PREHISTORIC DATING 

The influence of weather and especially rainfall on the size of rings 
has individualized them with great uniformity over a wide extent of 
country. This produces distinctive configurations of large and small 
rings, which, like " fingerprints of Father Time," can be recognized 
from tree to tree. Thus, cross dating is possible over at least the 
northern half of the Pueblo area, and we are able to build up a long 



310 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

chronology in Arizona pines, which has not only furthered our 
studies of climate but has supplied the building dates of a number 
of prehistoric ruins. 

This chronology building has been done on the numerous speci- 
mens which the archeologists have obtained from prehistoric ruins 
since 1922. These came chiefly from Neil M. Judd, who was excavat- 
ing Pueblo Bonito on behalf of the National Geographic Society. 
He had learned of the cross dating between diiferent ruins and rea- 
lized that such cross dating could be carried from the present time 
back into prehistoric ages, thus giving the actual date of the great 
ruin in whose repair he was engaged. His faith in the possibility 
of such dating resulted in important assistance from Doctor Gros- 
venor and the research committee of the society. And this, together 
with occasional friendly aid of other institutions, brought in large 
collections of prehistoric beams, which reached over 800 in number 
by 1928. These cross dated in large measure and supplied a prehis- 
toric chronology 586 years long, and in doing so gave the relative 
age of more than 30 prehistoric ruins from which the specimens 
had come. 

The problem of finding material to fill the gap between the prehis- 
toric chronology and the historic sequence extending back to 1260 
A. D. occupied us in the field trips of 1928 and 1929. Large collec- 
tions were first obtained from the Hopi villages, the Pueblo struc- 
tures which were still occupied by the Indians. The village of 
Oraibi, which 40 years ago had 900 inhabitants, was discovered to be 
over 500 years old. It is now largely abandoned. 

But the Hopi beams did not show rings that extended back far 
enough, so we searched and found the ruins from which some of 
these Hopi people came. Thus, we succeeded in getting the first 
prehistoric dates at the ruin of Kawaioku, in the Jeddito area. The 
dates extended from 1357 to 1495. In preparation for 1929 we 
studied pottery chronologies and found that the beams in the gap 
would be associated with an orange-colored pottery, which was a 
transition from red to cream color. We also concluded that the exist- 
ence of charcoal was very important on account of its wonderful 
preservations. Therefore, we must find ruins near the border of the 
great pine forest. 

These conditions were best fulfilled at Showlow and Pinedale, 50 
miles south of Holbrook. The actual gap beam was found at Show- 
low, June 22, 1929. It showed the well-known rings in the 1300's, 
then the group of microscopic rings during the drought in the late 
1200's, then a splendid series to the central ring that grew in 1237. 
The early drought years identified on this piece were entered on our 
plots as an extension of the historic series, and that evening the com- 



CHRONOLOGY DOUGLASS AND ANTEVS 311 

plete identity between this extension and the late prehistoric rings 
was firmly established. Thus the problem was solved. To our sur- 
prise there was no gap, but an overlapping of more than 20 years. It 
had been impossible to recognize this on account of the great drought 
in the late 1200's, which rendered most trees badly defective. Nat- 
urally, with so many defects during that drought interval, it has 
been gratifying to see since then tree records both in the Sierra 
Ancha Mountains of Arizona and others on the east slopes of the 
Jemez Mountains in New Mexico which check with precision the 
identity assigned to the rings in that great drought. 

This solution gave at once the dating of 42 ruins ; the number has 
now reached 75, scattered over northern Arizona, northern New 
IMexico, and the southern edges of Colorado and Utah. Many of 
these were built just before the great drought in the late 1200's. 
Evidently that climatic catastrophe had a profound effect on the 
welfare of the primitive inhabitants. Many ruins northeast of 
Flagstaff dated in the llOO's, and one at least lasted until 1278. The 
great tower in Mummy Cave ruin, in Canyon del Muerto, dated in 
the early years of the drought. White House ruin in Canyon de 
Chelly, came before 1100, as did Cliff Palace and the earlier ruins 
of Mesa Verde. Other ruins in Mesa Verde were built during the 
following 200 years. Aztec, in northwestern New Mexico, with its 
450 rooms, was built in the dozen years between 1110 and 1122. 
Pueblo Bonito, the largest of them all, had its early construction 
between 919 A. D. and 950. Its major building was in the last half 
of the eleventh century, and its final construction extended into the 
early years of the twelfth century. 

Thus, in closing the gap, the chronology was extended back to 700 
A. D. Nearly every portion of it has been covered by at least 100 
specimens. Much of the eighth century from 735 to 800 A. D. has 
now been covered by a considerable number of specimens from the 
vicinity of Flagstaff, collected by Dr. Harold S. Colton, director of 
the Museum of Northern Arizona, and his colleagues. And yet only 
one specimen, and that from Pueblo Bonito, covers with accuracy the 
years from A. D. 700 to 735.^ Meanwhile further extensions are 
under way. Groups of specimens, collected chiefly by Earl H. 
Morris, have given two long sequences totaling over 600 years, which 
seem at present to precede the known chronology, beginning at 
700 A. D. 

One of the very interesting studies now in progress is being carried 
on by Doctor Colton, on pit houses near Flagstaff, Ariz., which were 
covered by a 10-inch layer of cinders from an eruption of Sunset

extends our record back to A. D. 643.

Crater near by. He has already been able to make a rough estimate 
of the date of this eruption, and there seems little doubt that eventu- 
ally it will become known with accuracy. 

CLIMATE AND PREHISTORY 

From the foregoing it is evident that prehistoric dating has become 
possible through weather effects in the rings of trees. Hence we not 
only get the dates of building periods in the history of the pueblos, 
but also we obtain some idea of the accompanying meteorological con- 
ditions. This has given us a strong impression of climatic stability, 
for there is no real evidence of any fundamental climatic change. 
The mean ring growth of a thousand years ago was not greatly 
different from that to-day in the same region. 

But there are signs of strong pulsations or cycles. In each hun- 
dred years there has been a noticeable drought. Every third century 
has seen a very great drought, such as 1880 to 1904, 1573 to 1593, and 
1276 to 1299. The effects of these come to us in notably defective 
trees and in abandoned pueblos. In the 500-year history of Oraibi 
even the small droughts were accompanied by decreased building. 

But perhaps the most significant inference is a combination of 
these two. Though the climate can not be said to be changing, the 
pulsations do not in all cases return completely to the earlier condi- 
tion, for in certain areas there seems to be a drying out due to human 
occupation. From studies of change in ring types and from many 
interesting conversations with the Pueblo Indians we can reconstruct 
a part of this story of human adventure in a dry country. It is prob- 
able that the primitive people settled on the forest border to get best 
advantage of timber, water supply, and farm lands. They injured 
the forest by cutting trees for house building and caused the forest 
borders to retreat. This injured the ground cover and permitted the 
soil to blow away until the conservation of moisture was decreased 
and torrential rains tore up their farm lands and compelled them to 
migrate to new locations. This has actually happened in the last 40 
years. Thus we find in this primitive history a human cycle of deep 
meaning for us who, even as these Indians, show an inclination to 
exhaust our natural resources without sufficiently generous thought 
for the future.

for many years your investigations of the traces of this event as they exist 
in North America. Your researches have involved the careful scrutiny of 
river valleys of the north and the beds of ancient lakes long dry. They have 
involved millions of exact measurements on the laminated clays laid down 
by summer meltings of Pleistocene glaciers. From these researches you have 
measured the severity of North American glaciation. You have determined 
the length of the ages which have elapsed since glaciation reached its height. 
You have found indications of the variations which existed in that distant 
past in the radiation of the sun. 

In recognition of these achievements, the Research Corporation of New

LATE-GLACIAL CLAY CHRONOLOGY OF NORTH AMERICA 

By Eknst Antbvs, Unirersiti/ of Stockholm 
[With 2 plates] 

Chronology is the framework of history, its units being tlie pigeon- 
holes in which events, changes, and conditions may be arranged in 
actual and consecutive succession. It brings order and gives per- 
spective. Chronology is as vital in geology, the history of the earth, 
as in human and cultural history. 

In geology, time is still essentially a vague conception. Mostly it 
is only relative; one formation is older than another because it lies 
beneath or because it contains more primitive forms of life. Fre- 
quently, however, time is in a way definite, comprising rough esti- 
mates in thousands or millions of j^ears. In a few instances it is 
absolute, with the year as the unit. 

The importance of the time aspect in geology is reflected by the 
many attempts made to determine it. Especially prominent among 
the endeavors aiming at absolute age are estimates based on atomic 
disintegration; on climatic changes combined with astronomical 
phenomena; on climatic changes alone; on the rate of accumulation 
of salts and degree of salinity of the ocean and of lakes without out- 
lets; on the rate of deposition, thickness, and extent of organic and 
inorganic sediments; on rate and amount of erosion by rivers, by 
lakes, and by the sea; on the rate and amount of weathering and 
leaching of rocks and soils; on the rate and amount of changes of 
level of land; on migrations and alterations of floras and faunas; 
and on sediments in which the year is recorded by lamination. All 
these methods have their good purposes. Frequently two or more 
methods serve to date the same beds or the same phenomena and 
afford a desirable check on one another. 



314 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

The several sediments recording the year are perliaps most impor- 
tant among the means of dating, but they are rather rare, occurring 
in any frequency and extent only during widely separated ages of 
the earth's history. First among these sediments comes the varved 
glacial clay. " Varve " and " varved " are v7ords of Nordic origin 
that have been applied to designate the " annual deposit " of a sedi- 
ment, and "yearly laminated." The striking alternation of light 
and dark layers in the glacial clay recalls annual rings in a cross 
section of wood. This similarity caused a Swedish scientist, as early 
as 1769, to assume that a pair of layers in the clay constituted the 
deposit of one year. Later, the same conclusion was independently 
reached by several geologists, next by an American in 1832. Vari- 
ous evidences have been presented to prove that a pair of layers 
actually represents the year (pi. Ih). 

The varved glacial clay consists of alternating layers of sand, silt, 
or coarse clay, light in color, and of fine to extremely minute clay, 
dark in color. The thickness of the coarse layers varies from a frac- 
tion of an inch to several inches. The thickness of the fine-grained 
layers is normally smaller and varies less. The varved clay was 
formed in lakes and slightly brackish bays outside melting glaciers 
and ice sheets. It was formed of mud brought directly from the 
melting ice. Similar clay is now depositing in lakes fed by glacial 
brooks, for instance, in Lake Louise in the Canadian Rockies. In 
winter time the late-glacial lakes evidently iroze over. 

In summer the temperature of the suri'ace water may have ranged 
from a little above freezing to about 35° F. It may not have at- 
tained 39.2° F., for, owing to the fact that water is densest at this 
temperature, the entire water mass would then have been of 39.2° 
and the lake would have had complete circulation, enabling winds 
to mix suspended mud in all water strata and even to stir up 
the bottom deposits. If this had been the case, the varved clay, if 
it could be formed, would show signs of erosion, which it does not 
do except rarely, when deposited in very shallow water. Further- 
more, if the surface water at a distance from the ice sheet had risen 
to 39.2°, this surface water would have sunk in the main lake 
body, since it was heavily loaded with mud. At a still greater dis- 
tance from the ice border, where the water temperature was higher, 
the mud would have sunk rather quickly, because of the lower vis- 
cosity of the water. Transportation of large quantities of mud in 
glacial lakes for more than 100 miles shows that the mud did not 
sink quickly. Therefore, the surface water of the glacial lakes may 
have ranged in temperature during summer from 32^ to about 35° ; 
the bulk of the water may have been, both in summer and winter, 



CHROlTOLOGY — DOltGLASS AlTD ANTfiVS

at a temperature of 38° to 39.2° ; and the water stratification may 
have been constantly inverse with the coldest water at the top. Tlie 
icy water coming from the glacier was consequently lighter than 
the lake water, and, even if discharged at the bottom of the lake, 
rose to near its surface. In doing so it brought along part of the 
suspended mud which was quickly distributed by waves and cur- 
rents, the finer the mud, the farther it was spread (fig. 1). 

Having arrived in the upper layers of the lake water, the mud 
began to separate according to coarseness and to sink, the coarse 
grains fairly fast, the fine particles at extremely slow rates. Silt 
grains would settle in a few days or weeks. Coarse clay particles, 
as well as part of the fine clay, also sank to the bottom during the 
summer. On the other hand, the bulk, or a great part, of the finest 
particles still remained in suspension when melting ended with the

arrival of winter. Because of very slow sinking, these minute 
particles could not reach bottom individually in the course of a year. 
However, owing to the perfect calm under the ice cover and to the 
development of a slight salinity of the water as a result of partial 
dissolution of the silicic acid of the mud, the particles flocculated or 
aggregated into small lumps, which settled before spring. It is this 
separation of the grains and particles by their different rate of fall 
through the water that produced the distinct lamination of the clay, 
causing the deposition of a silty layer in the summer and a clayey 
layer in the winter. This pair of layers, representing the annual 
deposit, is the varve. 

The chief conditions of formation of the varved glacial clay 
were, therefore, that at least part of the fine-grained mud came 
from a melting glacier, that the water in which deposition took place 
was fresh, or practically so, and was heavier than the river water, 
so that this water and the contained mud could rise to the upper 
strata of the lake and the mud separate and settle according to size 
of grains and particles.

ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 



If these conditions had not been filled, i3ractically all the fine mud 
would have flocculated and settled during the summer, together with 
the coarse fractions forming a massive clay. Homogeneous clays 
were formed where glacial brooks discharged into strongly saline 
waters, and they are now deposited where ordinary brooks and rivers 
empty into regular lakes of our latitudes (pi. la). 

If the debris was uniformly distributed in the ice, the quantity 
of mud brought into a glacial lake during a summer was propor- 
tional to the amount of ice melting. The thicknesses of the varves, 
therefore, record the relative amount of ice melting during the dif- 
ferent years. Since ice melting is found, by observations in the Alps 
and elsewhere, to be determined chiefly by summer temperature, the

Section through center of glacier orifice. At a distance in lateral direction from 
the mouth of the glacial river the varve is thin and consists of fine sand, silt, and 
clay at the very ice edge 

relative thickness of the varves was defined, in the last analysis, by 
the total summer heat. Thick varves, therefore, mean warm and 
long summers ; thin varves, cold and short summers. 

While several geologists interpreted the layer-pair in the glacial 
clay as the annual deposit, Gerard de Geer, of Sweden, went further 
and, in 1885, propounded a method to use it for a geochronology of 
the waning stage of the last Pleistocene ice sheets. The method is 
based on the fact that, when the ice sheet terminated in water, its 
edge formed the proximal limit of the clay varves. As the ice edge 
retreated the varves extended farther and farther in centripetal 
direction. The varves accordingly cover one another as shingles on 
a roof (fig. 2). ' 

The field operations consist in measuring continuous series of 
varves in exposures, if possible from the bottom of the clay. The 
limits of the varves are marked on strips of strong paper giving the

into graphs to enable comparison (fig. 3). Because it is determined 
by the summer heat, the relative thickness of a varve is, under other-

wise favorable conditions, about the same everywhere in the area in 
which the total summer heat underwent similar yearly fluctuations. 

Varve graphs from the same region, 
therefore, show essentially the same 
fluctuations and can be matched, and 
the separate varves identified (fig. 4) . 
Owing to the imbricated position of 
the varves, the rate of recession of the 
ice edge can be determined (fig. 2). 
Thus, if the bottom varve at one local- 
ity is found to correspond to varve 
number 21 at another locality, the lat- 
ter place was uncovered 20 years 
earlier than the former. By a series 
of varve measurements in the direction 
of the ice retreat, the rate of uncover- 
ing and the time involved can be de- 
termined. By measurements distrib- 
uted over an area the outline of the 
ice border can be mapped. This is De 
Geer's method of study. 

Graphs of clay varves may be cor- 
related, if they derive from regions 
that experienced similar yearly varia- 
tions of the total summer heat and 
were released from the ice at about 
the same time. These conditions con- 
fine the possibilities of varve correla- 
tions within somewhat narrow limits. 
They preclude correlations of varve 
graphs from North America and Eu- 
rope and from distant parts of the 
same glaciated area. The conditions 
evidentl}' do not prevent correlations 
of varve graphs from adjacent valleys, 
for instance, from the Hudson, the 
Connecticut, and the Merrimac valleys. 
The last ice sheet of North America 
comprised almost entire Canada and 
the States down to a line running 
through New York City, south of the 
Great Lakes, and a little below the in- 
ternational boundary in the far West.

large lakes were dammed between its front and higher land outside. 
Because the central parts of the ice-covered areas were more deeply 
depressed by the weight of the ice than the peripheral regions, many 
lowlands and valleys that now drain southward at that time con- 
tained large lakes. The Hudson and the Connecticut Valleys held 
series of long and deep lakes that extended from the Narrows and 
from Long Island Sound, respectively, to northern New York and 
New England. The ocean did not enter these valleys because the sea 
level of that time stood about 300 feet lower than the present and tlie 
coast line probably some 95 miles outside Sandy Hook and 10 to 15 
miles outside the east end of Long Island. The Great Lakes were 
larger in late glacial times than now; the Timiskamiug-Abitibi- 
Timmins region was covered by an enormous water body. Lake 
Barlow-Ojibway ; more than half Manitoba was flooded by the huge 
Lake Agassiz; and smaller ice lakes existed in all parts of the 
glaciated area. On the other hand, the St. Lawrence and the Ottawa 
Valleys were early inundated by a marine gulf, the Champlain Sea, 
in which, because of the salinity, the fine mud quickly flocculated 
and settled, forming almost massive clays. 

The sedimentation in the glacial lakes was enormous. Lakes that 
were small in relation to their drainage areas were actually filled 
with gravel, sand, silt, and clay. This holds for some of the lakes 
in the New England valleys. Lakes that were ponded by the ice 
were suddenly lowered or emptied when lower outlets were opened 
during the withdrawal of the ice front. Other lakes were drained 
suddenly as a result of overflow and down cutting of their drift 
barriers. Still other lakes were emptied because of a gradual low- 
ering of their outlets by vertical movements of the land. After the 
disappearance of the water bodies, the lake beds have been eroded 
and frequently deeply dissected by rivers. It is exposures of the 
old lake sediments in river banks, in erosional bluffs on residual 
lakes, and in clay pits and road cuts that have been used to measure 
the clay varves (pi. 2). 

Thanks to support from the American Geographical Society of 
New York, the Geological Survey of Canada, Harvard University, 
the National Kesearch Council in Washington, and other institu- 
tions, the writer has been able for several years to study the varved 
clays in the Eastern States, southern Quebec, central Ontario, the 
Timiskaming-Cochranc region, and northern Manitoba. The first 
aim has been to make varve measurements at short interspaces along 
lines running from the periphery of the ice sheet to its center in 
Labrador, and, if possible, to connect these separate observations in 
an unbroken record of the rate of withdrawal of the ice border, of 
time in years, and of the variations of the total summer heat. The 



320 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

next purpose has been to correlate geological events with this time 
scale. The third aim has been to connect, as far as possible, the 
late-glacial chronology with our Christian era. The fourth aim has 
been to determine, by means of the varve chronology, the length of 
time employed for the performance of certain geophysical, chemical, 
and biological changes, so as to have meters that may help us to 
estimate the time factor for similar changes and processes when 
no direct means of determining time is available. 

Varve records consequently have been obtained for considerable 
parts of the age of waning of the North American ice sheet. The 
length of time that the last ice sheet kept its greatest extent in Long 
Island is not directly determined, but a comparison of the bulk of 
the two terminal moraines with that of moraines whose time factor 
is known suggests that this entire niarginal zone represents roughly 
2,000 years. The ice sheet began to withdraw almost immediately 
after reaching its southernmost line. From varve measurements, 
moraines, and other features the time of release of the belt extending 
from the terminal moraines to Newburgh, N. Y., and Hartford, 
Conn,, may be estimated at about 5,500 years. The rate of retreat of 
the ice front has been determined from Hartford northward to St. 
Johnsbury, Vt., with exception of one narrow zone at Claremont, 
N. H. Besides the main line of clay measurements in the Connecti- 
cut Valley, long controlling lines have been obtained in the Hudson 
and Merrimac Valleys. The time occupied by the ice recession from 
Hartford to St. Johnsbury is about 4,100 years. Since the distance 
is 185 miles, the rate averaged 240 feet a year, or 22 years to a mile. 
The actual rate of melting back varied considerably. At North- 
ampton-Amherst, Mass., and probably again at Claremont, N. H., 
the ice border halted and readvanced. At Woodsville, N. H., the 
recession was as much as 1,100 feet a year, the highest amount ob- 
served in North America outside of Manitoba. Shortly after, the 
recession grew slower, and at St. Johnsbury it came to a stop, fol- 
lowed by a short advance. 

The ice border of St. Johnsbury may have trended westward to 
the Adirondacks and then southwestward to south of Lake Ontario. 
In the belt extending from this line to North Bay and Mattawa the 
rate of decay of the ice has not been determined by varve measure- 
ments because of scarcity of clays, but the uncovering coincided 
almost precisely with the life of Lake Algonquin, a very prominent 
lake occupying the basins of the three upper Great Lakes. The sev- 
eral successive stages constituting Lake Algonquin, the changes of 
level of the Ottawa region, varve series, and other things, all indicate 
that the time occupied by the ice release of central Ontario was long, 
some 10,000 years, in round numbers. 



CHEONOLOGY DOUGLASS AND ANTEVS 321 

In the belt between Mattawa and Lake Timiskaming varved clay 
is practically lacking. The ice retreat from the mouth of Montreal 
Kiver on Lake Timiskaming to La Sarre on the Transcontinental 
Railway northeast of Lake Abitibi took 1,208 years. Since the dis- 
tance is 118 miles, this represents an average of 515 feet a year. The 
rate was relatively uniform in wide belts, though it increased north- 
ward. Later it became irregular, and when the ice front had reached 
far north of Cochrane, it halted and began to move southward. This 
readvance probably amounted to as much as 70 miles, for the ice 
border finally reached Iroquois Falls and points 22 miles south of 
Cochrane. Contemporaneous with the beginning of this readvance 
the huge Lake Barlow-Ojibway, held in by the ice in the north, was 
suddenly drained northwestward to Hudson Bay. This event took 
place during the years 2,022 (or 2,015) to 2,027 after the uncovering 
of the mouth of Montreal River on Lake Timiskaming. The drain- 
age marks the end of the continuous varve chronology in these re- 
gions, for subsequently there were only small, scattered lakes in 
which varved clay could be deposited. At points farther east, how- 
ever, it may be possible to extend the varve series toward the ice 
center in the Labrador peninsula, though this is hardly profitable 
until the wilderness of this region has become more easily accessible. 

In addition to these longer varve records, shorter ones comprising 
from 100 to about 1,000 years have been obtained in New Jersey, 
New York, New England, southeastern Quebec, the regions east and 
north of Lake Huron, and northern Manitoba. Local glacial geology 
has been correlated with these chronological fragments, which, it 
is hoped, will ultimately be tied together with the longer varve 
series. 

As touched upon, correlations of varve graphs from North America 
and Europe are not possible. However, a correlation of the late- 
glacial epoch in North America and Europe may be made on the 
basis of the major changes of temperature that are recorded in the 
rate of disappearance of the ice sheets. The climatic alteration that 
set a stop to the growth of the ice sheets and introduced their wan- 
ing was the greatest in late Quaternary time. Since its main factor 
was a temperature rise, and since marked temperature changes in 
the post-glacial epoch seem to have made themselves felt both in 
North America and in Europe, it is more likely than not that the 
last main ice sheets began to shrink at about the same time. If 
they did not, the American ice sheet may have been the earlier to 
commence waning, not vice versa. It is therefore probable that, gen- 
erally speaking, the peripheral belts of the two main areas of glaci- 
ation were uncovered at the same time. In the region between the 
south side of Lake Ontario and Mattawa River, which forms the

intermediate belt in North America, the uncovering was exception- 
ally slow. In the Danish Islands, which represent the intermediate 
zone in Europe, the recession was also slow and repeatedly inter- 
rupted by large oscillations. Central Ontario and the Danish Is- 
lands may therefore have been uncovered at the same time. In the 
regions north of these intermediate belts, both in North America 
and in Europe, the rate of retreat was rapid for a few thousand 
years. When the ice fronts had retired to the Cochrane region in 
Ontario and to central Sweden and southern Finland, respectively, 
they halted and oscillated. Also these stages of recession and halt 
perhaps correspond, though it is important to note that the oscilla- 
tions at Cochrane rej)resented a much longer time than did those in 
Fenno-Scandia which amounted to 659 years. For the present the 
attempts at trans-Atlantic correlation can hardly be carried beyond 
these general suggestions. 

Because the rate of retreat of the ice front and the thickness of 
the clay varves form direct measures of the amount of the relative 
summer heat, they furnish excellent material for the study of long 
as well as short temperature cycles. However, few analyses for de- 
termining cj'cles have been made. The record of the summer heat 
supplied by the varved glacial clay is the longest known. The clay 
chronology, even though incomplete, sheds light on several problems 
not touched upon in the preceding, as, for instance, the rate of ero- 
sion, rate of development of shore lines, rate of sedimentation, rate 
of leaching and weathering of soils and rocks, rate of vertical move- 
ments of the earth's crust resulting from the removal of the ice load, 
rate of occupancy by plants and animals of the lifeless regions that 
were exposed with the melting of the ice sheets, rate of develop- 
ment of plant and animal associations, and on the rate of evolution 
of human species, races, and cultures.

SHAPING THE EAKTH 



By William Bowie 
V. S. Coast and Qeodetie Survey 



THE CRUST OF THE EARTH 

It is generally recognized that the earth has had a surface of solid 
material for something like a billion and a half years. At the begin- 
ning of this time the earth's surface was irregular and there have 
been vertical and horizontal changes occurring continuously during 
this long interval. These changes have been due to erosion and sedi- 
mentation and to forces which are acting on the materials forming 
the outer 50 or 100 miles of the earth. 

If the earth's material were in a liquid or highly plastic condition, 
and if there were no rotation, its surface would be a true sphere. 
With such a body undergoing rotation the surface would be a spher- 
oid. It has been found by geodetic measurements that the shape of 
the mean sea-level surface approximates very closely a true spheroid. 
The deviations between the spheroid and the water surface, or geoid, 
are probably not greater than 100 meters. These forms are, of course, 
due to the continuous gravitational attraction of the particles of the 
earth for each other. The earth's surface is irregular because of the 
presence of material of different densities near the earth's surface. 
Under the continents the densities are less than they are for the mate- 
rial under the oceans. There is rigidity in the outer portion of the 
earth for otherwise there would be a slumping down of the high areas 
and the moving material would fill up valleys and ocean basins and 
bring the earth's surface to a true spheroid. 

FORMATION OF OCEANS AND CONTINENTS 

One of the most interesting problems of geology involves the 
formation of oceans and continents. Some geologists will say that 
this is a subject that need not be considered for we may accept oceans

and continents as having come into being prior to the present geo- 
logical age and that our attention should be given to the problem of 
unfolding the geological record since the beginning of sedimentation. 
The mind of a human being can not be confined to any particular 
subject or group of subjects nor to any particular phase of a subject. 
It is bound to consider any question that presents itself. 

It does seem very strange that we should have great masses of 
material standing above sea level, as continents and islands, and 
o;reat troudis or basins below the waters of the oceans. We have 
enough geodetic evidence to prove conclusively that the ocean bot- 
toms are depressed because of the greater density of the material in 
the crust below them, and that the continental and island masses 
stand above sea level because the density of the material in the crust 
below them is less than normal ; but what could have caused these 
abnormal densities ? Why is it that under the continents we have a 
layer, which some claim is about 20 miles in thickness, of light rocks 
called granites, while under the oceans we have no granites ? 

There have been many explanations offered as to why we have 
oceans and continents, but the only one that appeals to me as having 
decided merit is that advanced by Osmond Fisher. About 40 years 
ago he wrote a book entitled " Physics of the Earth's Crust," which 
contains much material of great value. He has a chapter on the 
possible origin of oceans and continents in which he discusses 
Darwin's idea that the moon at one time was thrown off from the 
earth. Darwin's discussion of the birth of the moon was more or less 
an academic one, and he made no suggestion as to what was the 
condition of the earth at the time that this birth occurred, but one 
is led to believe by Darwin's writings that he had in mind a fluid 
earth. Fisher believed that there was an outer solid shell on the 
earth at the time that the moon was formed and that the earth lost 
much of the outer granite shell as a result of the disruption. The 
places from which the crustal material was thrown off were filled 
with subcrustal material, but the light granite occupied greater 
depth than the heavier subcrustal material which replaced it. In 
consequence the healed scars had surfaces which were lower than the 
surfaces of the portions of the crustal material which remained. 

Darwin's hypothesis is based on the idea that the earth was ro- 
tating very rapidly and that as it slowed down to such a rate of 
rotation as would make the tides, caused by the attraction of the sun, 
sj'nchronize with the natural period of vibration of the earth, there 
would be an accumulation of tidal effect which would make the 
earth's mass unstable. Darwin estimated that at the time of, or 
just before, the disruption, the major axis of the earth was about 
twice the length of the minor axis. This would mean that the 



SHAPING THE EARTH — BOWIE 327 

earth's surface must have been increased by approximately fifteen 
millions of square miles. The solid crust, which at the time of the 
birth of the moon must have been 30 or 40 miles in thickness, could 
not have stretched over this increased surface but would have been 
fractured and torn apart with great gaps between the crustal blocks. 
It may be that this distortion just prior to the birtli of the moon 
had more to do with the scattering of the remaining crustal ma- 
terial over the earth's surface than the actual disruption. 

It is ratlier interesting to look at a globe and note that the two 
coasts of the Atlantic are so nearly parallel that they remind one 
of the shores of a great river. Wegener has advanced a theory 
that Nortli and South America broke away from the rest of the 
continental masses and moved westward during recent geological 
times. This is a very interesting theory which has many advo- 
cates and also many opponents. I am rather inclined to think that 
there are difficulties in the Wegener hj^pothesis which are very hard 
to explain away. It seems to me that tlie Fisher idea of the birth 
of the moon gives us a rather logical explanation of the creation 
of oceans and continents, and the strongest point of this theory is 
that it does no violence to isostasy. 

It is certain that the earth's surface was irregular at the begin- 
ning of the sedimentary age, for without irregularities, such as we 
now have, the water of the oceans would have covered the whole 
earth's surface to a depth of approximately 9,000 feet if the amount 
of water was the same as now. With all of the land area covered 
by water, there could have been no erosion and sedimentation, such 
as we have had for a period of approximately one and one-half 
billions of years. 

KNOWN FACTS ABOUT THE EARTH 

The earth should be treated like any material structure which 
comes under our observation for explanation or analysis. No one, 
of course, can give us the true explanation of how the earth came 
into being or state accurately what has been going on to change its 
surface configuration. But we have now at hand a number of facts 
which should enable us to arrive at some logical conclusions. We 
know, of course, the earth's shape and size, the portions of its sur- 
face covered by land and water, its average density, and the density 
of its surface material. We also know that the temperature increases 
witli deptli. We know that there are many earthquakes occurring 
annually and that there is no area which is entirely free from them. 
Most of the quakes are extremely slight, but we are reasonably cer- 
tain that, with few exceptions, they result from breaking rock and, 
therefore, there must be forces within the earth large enough to cause 
such breaking. 



328 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

We know that there has been a tremendous amount of erosion and 
sedimentation during the present era, which is called the sedimentary 
age of the earth. It is certain that the earth's surface was irregular 
at the time that sedimentary rocks began to be formed, for without an 
irregular surface there could have been no running water, and with- 
out running water there could have been no erosion and sedimenta- 
tion. Of course, no one knows whether the amount of water on the 
earth has been constant or variable, but it is reasonably certain that 
land has been exposed above the waters of the ocean for about 
a billion and a half years. This is an estimate that is frequently used 
by students of the earth, and it seems to be generally accepted as of 
the order of magnitude of the period of time that has elapsed since 
the formation of the first sedimentary rocks. 

Geologists tell us that practically all of the exposed areas of the 
earth have at some time in the geological past been beloAV sea level. 
These areas are now at varying distances above sea level and, hence, 
their change in elevation, with respect to sea level, must have been 
due to an actual lifting up of land areas rather than a decrease in 
the amount of water of the earth. If the latter had been the cause 
for the changes in elevation, there would be uniformity in the eleva- 
tions of exposed strata. 

The isostatic investigations indicate that the solid or rigid material 
of the earth extends only to a depth of approximately 60 miles below 
sea level. Some investigators are of the opinion that the depth to 
which the solid rock extends is very much smaller than that. The 
interior of the earth acts as if it were plastic to long-continued 
stresses. The earth has an outer shell which rests upon a plastic 
interior. A disturbance of the isostatic equilibrium leads to hori- 
zontal and vertical changes in the earth's surface. Some areas go 
down under the weight of sediments and other areas which have been 
undergoing erosion for long periods of time increase in elevation. 
There is also a rising up of material that was once below sea level 
and a sinking down of areas that were once standing high above 
sea level. 

These and other known facts regarding the earth arc the basis for 
the interpretation of the processes which have shaped its surface. 

There have been many theories advanced as to why the earth has an 
irregular surface. Such theories may be considered as mere guesses, 
for no one can reproduce to-day the forces, resistances, and tempera- 
tures that must have been involved when the earth came into being 
or when its surface was changed from one of fairly uniform eleva- 
tion to one which has the great differences in elevation that are seen 
to-day. 

Mineralogists tell us that the continents are underlaid by granite, 
and that granite is absent from the crust under the ocean. Granite 



SHAPING THE EARTH BOWIE 329 

has a smaller density than that of the basalts which underlie the 
oceans. Originally the earth must have had the granite or light 
material lying over its surface like a huge blanket of fairly uniform 
thickness. Why is it that now the granite is absent from such large 
portions of the earth's surface'^ There are certainly no known 
forces that could push the granite up into isolated masses. Gravity 
would have resisted such piling up, and if forces had been sufficiently 
great to force the granite into separate masses, these masses of 
crushed rock would have slumped down soon after the forces had 
ceased to operate. 

ISOSTASY 

It was a geologist, the famous C. E. Button, of the United States 
Geological Survej', who coined the word " isostasy " in an address, 
entitled " On Some of the Major Problems of Physical Geology," at 
a meeting of the Philosophical Society of Washington, in 1889. 
Dutton discussed some of the major problems of geology, including, 
of course, the formation of mountains and the effect of the tre- 
mendous amount of erosion and sedimentation. He came to the 
conclusion that the shifting of material caused stresses which could 
not be withstood by the strength of the earth's materials. He felt 
that there must be a sagging down of the earth's surface under the 
weight of the sediments and a rising up of the surface where erosion 
had carried material away. He stated that in his opinion moun- 
tains are not extra loads added to the earth's crust but that they are 
due to lighter than normal material in the crust below them. In 
effect he outlined what might be called a flotation hypothesis, that is, 
that the continents were floating in heavier material just as ice floats 
in water, A corollary of this hypothesis of Button's is that the 
irregularities of the earth's surface are due to deviations from normal 
densities in the outer portion of the earth. Under the oceans the 
density is greater and under the continents less than normal. 

At the beginning of the present century geodesists realized that 
isostasy w^as a subject of vital interest to them. Previously, for 
decades, they had been attempting to explain the abnormal behavior 
of the plumb line to which astronomical observations are referred 
and of the pendulum by which values of gravity are determined. 

THE FIGURE OF THE EAUTH 

If the earth's surface had no irregularities but conformed to a 
mathematical surface (a spheroid of revolution), then at any place 
on it the direction of gravity would be at right angles to a plane 
tangent to this spheroid at the point of observation. But the earth 
has an irregular surface and due to this irregularity the figure 



330 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

formed by the surfaces of the waters of the ocean and of the waters 
of sea-level canals (extended, in imagination, through the continents) 
deviates from a true mathematical figure. This deviation is un- 
doubtedly a maximum under the great mountain systems like the 
Himalayas and the Alps, where the geoid, or water surface, is above 
the mathematical one. Conversely, over the deepest parts of the 
ocean the geoid, or water surface, is probably depressed to the maxi- 
mum amount below this spheroid. In any event, there is an angle 
between the water surface and the mathematical surface at any 
point at which astronomical observations may be made. This angle 
means a deviation of the direction of gravity, or the plumb line, and 
affects the observations for astronomical latitudes and longitudes 
accordingly. 

EFFECT OF TOPOGRAPHY ON GEODETIC DATA 

Geodesists had noticed this condition in a number of parts of the 
earth where surveying and mapping operations had been under- 
taken, and efforts were made to apply a correction for the influence 
of the irregularities of the surface. It was evident to each investi- 
gator that a mountain system, such as the Himalayas, would have 
an attractive effect on the plumb line at stations within a reasonable 
distance of it. Efforts were made to compute the effect of these 
great masses which lie above sea level, but when such corrections 
were applied it was found that they were larger than were necessary 
to bring the theoretical and observed values into accord. The moun- 
tains, apparently, were lighter than normal, but impossibly small 
densities would have to be assumed for the materials composing the 
mountains to bring the two values into exact agreement. 

Pratt and Airy, working on geodetic data about the middle of the 
last century, arrived at the conclusion that the reason why moun- 
tains and continents stand above sea level is because lighter materi- 
als lie below them. While they did not, so far as I am aware, make 
any definite statement that the abnormal densities could only extend 
to a moderate depth, yet this idea was implied in their statements 
regarding the deficiencies in densities that must lie below mountains 
and continents. They advanced their ideas about 75 years ago, but 
it is only within the last 10 years that their ideas and those of But- 
ton, expressed 41 j'^ears ago, have been accepted generally by stu- 
dents of the earth as a working principle in earth studies. 

VARIATIONS OF GRAVITY 

Geodesists have used geodetic data in the form of triangulation, 
of astronomical determinations of longitude and latitude, and of 



SHAPING THE EARTH BOWIE 331 

values of gravity to test this flotational hypothesis. It is the only 
method, so far as I am aware, by which the idea can be quantita- 
tively tested. We have a direct measure of the extent to which the 
plumb line deviates from the line that is at right angles to the 
spheroid surface, and a measure of the difference between the theo- 
retical and observed values of gravity. The idea of isostasy can be 
tested by means of these data. 

If the earth were a true spheroid and there were no irregularities 
on its surface and if the densities along each radius were normal, 
gravity would increase slightly as one proceeded from the Equator 
to one of the poles. The attraction of the earth at sea level would 
be about one two-hundredths part greater at a pole than at the 
Equator. Enough work has been done to prove conclusively that 
gravity does follow very definite laws. For instance, it changes on 
the average about one part in a million for a mile change in latitude. 
It changes one part in a million for about 10 feet change of elevation. 
These changes are perfectly normal, for the centrifugal force is a 
maximum at the Equator and zero at the poles, and, besides, the at- 
traction at either pole is greater than it is at a point on the Equator. 
Necessarily, too, a particle is attracted less by the mass of the earth 
when elevated than when it is exactly at sea level. 

It is not necessary to go into details regarding the geodetic tests 
of isostasy, for the methods used and the results obtained have all 
been set forth in a number of publications of geodetic organizations. 
It is sufficient to state that when isostasy is taken into account in 
computing geodetic data, harmonious or practically harmonious re- 
sults are obtained. By means of geodetic data it has been possible 
to determine the approximate depth below sea level to which these 
abnormal densities extend. The most probable depth obtained from 
mountain and plateau stations of the United States is about 96 kilo- 
meters, approximately 60 miles, below sea level. This depth is con- 
firmed by determinations of A. H. Miller, of the Dominion Observa- 
tory at Ottawa, Canada, who found, from analysis of gravity data 
at mountain stations in the western part of that country, a depth also 
of approximately 60 miles. 

COMPARISON OF PRATT AND AIRY HYPOTHESES 

There has been much discussion in literature on isostasy of the 
question as to whether the Pratt or the Airy hypothesis is the true 
one. Pratt postulated that the densities vary under the different 
classes of topography. Under the oceans the density would be ab- 
normally great and under the continents it would be abnormally 
small. Airy, on the other hand, suggested that the depth of com- 



332 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

pensation is very irregular and that crustal masses under the con- 
tinents extend much farther below sea level than do such masses 
under the oceans. Under mountain areas these protuberances would 
be greater than under plateaus and valleys. 

We have not yet been able to prove which of the two hypotheses 
is the true one, since the application of either of them to gravity and 
deflection data gives about the same satisfactory results. However, 
looking at the matter from a purely physical standpoint, I am in- 
clined to think that there are decided weaknesses in the Airy hy- 
pothesis and that the Pratt hypothesis is probably the true one. 
Perhaps with a greater accumulation of data we may in the future 
be able to show which one of these hypotheses is the better one. We 
should be able to derive a depth of compensation for each extensive 
mountain area and if the Airy hypothesis is the true one, then the 
higher the mountain area the greater should be the derived depth 
of compensation. When such mountain areas as the Andes and the 
Himalayas are covered by geodetic stations, it should be possible 
to make this test. 

ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING ISOSTATIC INVESTIGATIONS 

Xecessaril}^, in carrying on such investigations as have been in- 
volved in the tests of isostasy, assumptions have to be made. The 
assumptions made by geodesists are approximately as follows : First, 
that isostasy is complete or perfect for even quite limited portions 
of the earth's crust; second, that there is a uniform distribution with 
respect to depth of the compensating deficiencies of density under 
continents and of the excesses of densities under oceans, that is, that 
the compensation starts at sea level and extends uniformly about CO 
miles to the lower limit of the crust; third, that the cosnpensation 
is directl}^ under the topographic feature and not spread out hori- 
zontally with respect to that feature; and fourth, that the density 
of the rock above sea level is 2.67. 

These assumptions are made merely for the convenience of the 
investigator. It would be practically impossible for him to assume 
anj^thing but very simple conditions because of the very large amomit 
of work involved in making the computations required for the tests. 
We do find that, when these assumptions are made and corresponding 
corrections are computed, the theoretical and actual values for the 
astronomical longitudes and latitudes and for values of gravity are 
brought very closely into agreement. There are some outstanding 
differences, and these must be a measure of the degree to which one or 
more of the assumed conditions are not true. The lower limit of 
compensation may not be a regular surface, it may be very much 
deeper under some parts of the continent than under others, and it 



SHAPING THE EARTH BOWIE 333 

may be deeper under the continents than under the oceans. The 
compensatino^ deficiency of density under a mountain system may 
be confined to a rather narrow zone vertically and not extend 
throughout the thickness of the crust. The compensation may be 
distributed widely in a horizontal direction from the topographic 
feature, and deficient densities under land masses and excessive densi- 
ties under ocean areas may not be sufficient to balance the irregulari- 
ties of the earth's surface in the regions studied. Finally, the den- 
sity of surface rock is variable. Undoubtedly, all of these factors 
come in to cause the differences between the theoretical and actual 
values which we call anomalies, but the anomalies are so small after 
the isostatic method has been applied that investigators are inclined 
to believe that the principle of isostasy has been amply tested and 
proved. Some of them, and I am one, believe that the principal 
cause of the anomalies is the effect of abnormally heavy or light 
material near the earth's surface and close to the astronomical or 
gravity stations. If we could find out the actual distribution of 
density in the earth's materials for a depth of 5 or 10 miles below 
the earth's surface, I am confident that we could reduce nearly all 
of the anomalies. 

This brings up the question as to whether or not it would be pos- 
sible to discover what the geologists call structural features that are 
buried below the earth's surface. This is a matter of great impor- 
tance and may have a bearing on the search for petroleum and ores. 
The gravity survey conducted over this country indicates certain 
places where there are extra heav}'' or extra light masses of material 
fairly close to the earth's surface. I do not know of any oil having 
been found, or drilling for oil having been undertaken, near any of 
our gravity stations as a result of our data, but I am sure that an 
intensive gravity survey would disclose structure that might be of 
value in the oil and mining industries. 

SOME ISOSTATIC CONCLUSIONS 

The evidence seems to justify the conclusion that all mountain and 
plateau areas were at one time occupied by low lying portions of the 
earth's surface on which great beds of sediments were laid down. 
Then these areas were raised up to form either mountains or plateaus. 
If there was much distortion, mountains resulted, and if the area 
went up in a more or less uniform way, extensive plateaus were 
formed. What caused these uplifts is one of the outstanding prob- 
lems of the science of geology. Many of the investigators of the past 
have postulated horizontal thrusts, while some, Dutton included, 
were inclined to favor a vertical movement as the predominant one 
with horizontal movements as incidental. 



334 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

It is absolutely certain that the masses pushed up, whether by- 
vertical or horizontal forces, are not extra loads above the surface 
which limits the depth of isostatic compensation. These masses 
above sea level are, of course, extra loads on the sea-level surface, 
but they can not be extra loads on the imaginary blocks of the earth's 
crust which are resting on the plastic subcrustal material. If they 
were extra loads, this fact would be easily and clearly indicated by 
geodetic data in the form of deflections of the vertical and values of 
gravity. The masses that apj)ear above sea level are compensated for 
by the deficiency of density in the material lying below them. 

The zone witliin which the compensation of topographic features 
lies must be of limited depth. If it were otherwise, the computed 
effect of the compensation would be practically zero and the material 
above sea level wouhl have full effect on the direction and force of 
gravity. 

It has been concluded from a study of the deflection data for the 
United States that the actual deflections of the vertical are on the 
average not more than about 10 per cent of what they would be if 
the masses above sea level and the deficiency of the mass in the oceans 
were not compensated by deviations from normal -densities in the 
crust below. This is the very strongest evidence possible in favor of 
isostasy and, also, in favor of the theory that the outer portion of the 
earth is rigid and strong. This rigid material, which has been found 
by geodesists to extend to an average depth of approximately 60 
miles, will resist for extremely long times gravitational forces which 
tend to make the earth's surface a true spheroid. The gravity data 
supplement the data derived from the deflection of the vertical in 
showing the existence of isostasy. 

Since areas of sedimentation and erosion and all plateau and moun- 
tain regions are now in isostatic equilibrium, it seems reasonably 
certain that they have been in equilibrium throughout the geological 
era. If this is true, we must conclude that there has been an actual 
uplift of the surface in some places and a down-warping in others. 
These changes in the earth's surface can occur only by vertical move- 
ments, due to changes in the density of the crustal or subcrustal 
material, or to the action of horizontal forces. I am inclined to favor 
the former idea because it is rather difficult to see where horizontal 
forces of sufficient magnitude could originate. Since the sea-level 
surface of the earth is at all places at right angles to the direction of 
gravity, it is difficult to see how any large horizontal component of 
the gravitational force could come into existence. 

I believe that there has been no collapsing of the outer shell of 
the earth on a shrinking nucleus. The outer solid shell of the earth 
must be of the magnitude of 60 miles in thickness, and certainly at 



SHAPING THE EAKTH BOWIE 335 

such a depth as 60 miles there could be no voids ; the outer shell, or 
crust, of the earth must be in intimate contact with subcrustal ma- 
terial and, therefore, there is no opportunity for the crustal material 
to collapse on a shrinking interior. Should the interior of the earth 
be losing heat and contracting in consequence, and should the crust 
of the earth not be losing heat and, therefore, remaining constant in 
volume, it is probable that the crust merely thickens locally as the 
nucleus contracts. Anj^ changes in the volume of the nuclear ma- 
terial would be so exceedingly slow that the crustal material would 
yield locally and the crust would continue to be in contact with the 
nucleus around the whole earth. 

ISOSTATIC xVDJUSTMENTS AND EARTHQUAKES 

If we accept the principle of isostasy — and it is a perfectly logi- 
cal thing to do — then we are confronted with the problem of how to 
apply this principle in geological studies and investigations. It is 
especially important to apply the isostatic principle to the question 
of earthquakes. 

Earthquakes have been occurring for a billion years, more or less, 
and probably they will continue to occur as long as the earth has sun- 
shine and rain. An earthquake is caused by the breaking of the outer 
portion of the earth's material. Without the break there would be 
no elastic shock. Where the material of the earth is hard, brittle, 
and elastic, it will resist deformation due to a force acting on it until 
the stress is greater than its strength and there will be a sudden yield- 
ing in the form of a rupture. Any elastic substance necessarily has 
vibrations when it is struck or broken, and that is exactly what hap- 
pens to the earth when we have an earthquake. The rock is snapped 
or broken, and the elastic waves set up by the sudden rupture travel 
great distances. 

Records of earthquake waves are made with an apparatus called a 
seismograph. There are many of these instruments scattered over the 
earth's surface and the number of earthquakes annually recorded on 
them has been recently estimated at 8,000. There are many quakes of 
such small intensity that their shocks are not received at the existing 
seismological stations. It is impossible to state how many earth- 
quakes actually occur over the earth, but if I might make a guess, I 
would say from 30,000 to 40,000 a year. 

One of the implications from the proof of isostasy is that the outer 
portion of the earth is much stronger than the materials that lie 
somewhat farther down. In order that the irregular surface of the 
earth may be maintained against the tremendous weight of masses of 
rock above sea level, this outer portion of the earth must be strong, 
that is, it must have a strength sufficient to prevent the continental 



336 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

masses slumping down and flowing into the ocean areas to fill up the 
basins. This strong material extends, according to geodesists, ap- 
proximately 60 miles below sea level. Below that the material must 
be lacking in strength and rigidity. It must yield to forces without 
breaking. As great masses of material are moved over the earth's 
surface the balance of the crust is disturbed. The extra load caused 
by sediments must push down the crust beneath and this must force 
the subcrystal material to move sidewise and some of it to push up the 
crust from where the eroded material came. The earth's crust is like 
a sheet of ice on a pond or on the Arctic Ocean. The crust lies quietly 
on the interior part of the earth until something happens to disturb 
the equilibrium. Although the crust of the earth is composed of 
strong material, the strength is finite, surely not great enough to with- 
stand the weight of the tremendous loads that have been shifted on 
the earth's surface. It is, however, strong enough to maintain the 
irregular surface of the earth just because of the floating principle. 

Earthquakes have occurred probably in all parts of the earth. 
One can not make an accurate estimate of the maximum size of 
the portion of the earth's crust in which, throughout geological 
time, no earthquakes have originated, but we see ail about us evi- 
dences of uplift or subsidence of the earth's surface. Each con- 
tinent has above sea level much sedimentary rock that must have 
been formed below tidal waters. These rocks in many cases are 
much tilted, curved, broken, and crushed. It is reasonably certain 
that there has been an uplift of the earth's surface rather than a 
decrease in the amount of ocean waters to cause these exposures. 
The best evidence that they have been pushed up is the fact that 
strata laid down in salt water in horizontal positions are now tilted 
at various angles from the horizontal. Then again, the same strata 
exposed in a number of widely separated places are found at different 
elevations above sea level. This, it seems, is an indication that there 
has been an actual uplift of the earth's surface. Every one who 
has engaged in mining operations knows of the tremendous amount 
of faulting that has occurred in the rocks. A coal seam will be 
followed for a certain distance and then it gives out. Later the 
same seam of coal may be found at a higher or lower elevation. 
The many fractures that are found in mines and at the earth's surface 
lead one to the very definite conclusion that there has been much 
shifting of material in the geological past. Each one of these shifts, 
or changes, where a fracture has occurred, has probably caused an 
earthquake. 

The earth may be classified as a yielding body. It should not be 
classed as a failing structure. A soapbubble or a glass ball, when 
subjected to stresses greater than its strength, will collapse, but it is 



SHAPING THE EARTH BOWIE 337 

impossible for the earth to collapse. The earth is like a solid rubber 
ball which will yield and chan<^e its shape to forces that are exerted 
upon it. The earth is a globe almost splierical, approximately 8,000 
miles in diameter. The number of cubic miles of material in the 
earth is great, but this large globe j'ields in a surprisingly easy 
manner to the forces tluit are acting upon it. 

OBJECTIONS TO THE CONTRACTION HYPOTHESIS 

Geologists and other students of the earth have for generations 
sought for the forces which may have disturbed the earth. Manj^ 
ideas have been advanced and some of them have had wide accept- 
ance. One of these is that the earth's interior is losing heat rather 
rapidly, while the outer portion of the earth, the crust, is maintaining 
its temperature. In consequence, there is a shrinkage of the interior 
of the eartli and a collapse of the crust, which causes earthquakes 
and elevates mountains and plateaus. This process is also held by 
some to be the cause of oceans and continents. It seems to me that 
a careful analysis of this hypothesis will lead one to the conclusion 
that it can not be true. The earth has been likened to an apple 
or potato. Every one knows that a baked potato or a baked apple 
has wrinkles in its skin. The contraction hypothesis implies that 
the nucleus of the earth is like the interior of the apple or potato 
and that the crust of the earth is like the skin, but the skins of 
the apple and potato have practically no weight, and, therefore, 
during the cooking the shrinkage of the interior, due to loss of 
moisture, makes the skin wrinkle to fit the reduced size of the interior 
of the apple or potato. 

The crust of the earth certainly can not be likened to the skin 
of the apple or potato. In the first place, the crust is about 60 miles 
in thickness and is composed of heavy rock. Then, again, this 
material is so heavy that no wrinkles could possibly form which 
would have voids under them like the voids under the wrinkles of 
the apple and potato. There can be no such thing as a buckling 
or crumpling of the earth's crust on a shrinking interior. If the 
interior of the earth is losing heat, while the crust of the earth 
is maintaining its temperature, the loss of this heat must be so 
exceedingly slow that there can be no chance for stresses to accumu- 
late to such an extent as to cause great horizontal forces. I believe 
that if in the course of geological time, measured by hundreds of 
millions of years, the earth's interior should cool and contract, the 
crust would continue to be in contact with the interior and, therefore, 
the crust would merely be thickened rather than buckled into ridges 
and troughs. Much has been written against the contraction hypoth- 
esis, notably by Mellard Reade and Alfred Wegener. 



338 ANNUAL. EEPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

DIASTROPHIC FORCES 

Tliere are no known forces which have their origin outside of the 
earth's material which can exert horizontal stresses on the crustal 
material of the earth of such strength as to form mountains and 
plateaus and cause earthquakes. It is true that the attractive forces 
of the sun and moon are exerted on the earth, and, since the portion 
of the earth that is nearest to the sun or the moon is attracted more 
than the material that is farther away, a stress is set up. This stress 
is not of sufficient magnitude, however, to rupture the material or to 
make it move out of its normal place, except to the extent of a slight 
elastic deformation called the earth tide. These tide-producing 
forces of the sun and the moon change phase every few hours as the 
earth turns on its axis. 

I think we can eliminate the attractive effect of the sun and the 
moon as being the cause of any geological phenomena involved in 
mountain forming, earthquakes, etc. Of course, the time of an 
earthquake on an island or near the continental coast may be decided 
by an exceptionally high or low water tide in the vicinity, but it is 
reasonably certain that the crustal material is brought nearly to the 
breaking point by some other cause and that the high or low tide 
supplies merely the small increment required to increase the stress 
beyond the breaking strength of the rock. The real causes of the 
major features of diastrophism must lie within the earth itself. 

Much has been written in recent years about the effect of the heat 
resulting from radioactivity of certain minerals in the outer portion 
of the earth. This, it seems to me, may be a factor in earth move- 
ments, but I am inclined to think it is one of minor importance. In 
the first place, the radioactivity is largely confined to the granitic 
material which is supposed to be only from 15 to 20 miles in thick- 
ness under the continents. There is no granite under the oceans, but 
some of the strongest earthquakes occur there and much of the 
ocean bottom is quite active from a geological standpoint. Broken 
ground with very steep slopes is found under the oceans, and many 
oceanic islands are due to volcanic activity. All of this implies that 
movements are going on in the crust under the oceans, and these 
surely can not be due alone to the radioactivity of minerals. The 
basalts which are supposed to underlie the granites of the continental 
areas and to form the bottoms of the oceans have present in them 
some radioactive minerals but not in such large proportions as are 
present in the granites. 

Again, we have the problem of accounting for physical or chemical 
activity that probably occurs even to the depth of 60 miles below 
sea level. Earth students, who have been writing on radioactive 



SHAPING THE EAETH — BOWIE 339 

minerals and their effect on geological processes, are inclined to the 
oi:)inion that the deep-lying materials have practically no effect on 
surface changes. 

If we eliminate forces existing outside of the earth, forces due to 
the supposed contraction of the earth's nucleus and the collapsing of 
the crust, and forces due to the effect of radioactive minerals as 
major causes of earth movements, we must search for some other 
forces that might be effective. 

We know that the temperature of the earth increases with depth. 
For the first 2 miles or less we have definite data from the deter- 
minations of temperatures in wells. There is a great variation in the 
rate at which the temperature increases with depth, but a fair aver- 
age is 50° C. per mile. The temperature certainly continues to 
increase below the 2-mile depth, for we have many active volcanoes 
in the world which emit cinders and lavas having temperatures of 
1,000° C. or more. Such temperatures would be found at a depth 
of approximately 20 miles if the temperature gradient were about 
the same throughout that depth as it is near the surface. Whether 
the temperature keeps on increasing with depth down to the center 
of the earth, we can not tell, for there is no way to discover, even 
approximate!}^, what the temperature may be at great depths. A 
material may be at a temperature which at the surface would be its 
melting point or even its boiling point, yet it probably would act 
like a strong solid when confined by the great pressures which must 
exist at considerable depths. A very hot interior of the earth, if 
there is little change in temperature from one period of time to 
another, will not exert any decided influence on the configuration 
of the earth's surface. Change in heat, however, whether a de- 
crease or increase, will exert force. It will cause expansion or con- 
traction of materials, but the heat of the interior of the earth is 
changing so slowly that it can not be a major cause of surface 
changes. One would be most unwise to assert that the heat of the 
interior of the earth, without any other influences acting, could not 
cause changes in elevation and geographic positions of points on 
the earth's surface, but, if this interior heat is a primary cause of 
surface movements, no one, so far as I am aware, has given a very 
clear explanation as to how the changes are effected. I am rather 
inclined to think that we may eliminate the heat of the earth's 
interior as the major cause of geological phenomena. This heat does 
affect those portions of the crust which are lowered by sedimen- 
tation or raised by erosion, but it is not the primary cause of surface 
movements. I believe we should look for something that is closer 
at hand and easier of understanding.

EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION 

There is one process continuously active which is so simple that 
apparently its influence on surface phenomena has been ignored or 
even overlooked except by a few. This is the phenomenon of ero- 
sion. Vast quantities of water fall to the earth each year and pre- 
sumbably this has been going on continuously since the beginning 
of the sedimentary age of the earth, the one that we are now in. 
According to the best geological and geophysical evidence, the earli- 
est sedimentary rocks were formed about a billion and a half years 
ago. It is absolutely impossible for sedimentary rocks to be formed 
without running water, and to have running water there must be 
sloping ground. A succession of sedimentary rocks has been formed 
during the past billion and a half years and for hundreds of millions 
of years there have been living creatures on the earth, so it seems 
perfectly logical to assume that rainfall must have occurred during 
all of that period. 

The average rainfall per year over the land surface of the earth is 
about 30 inches. Of course, there are regions where the rainfall is 
100 inches or more, but these areas are very restricted in size, and 
there are other areas, such as the great deserts, where there is no 
rain at all or only a very few inches. A rainfall of 30 inches a year 
amounts to about 1 mile in every 2,000 years, and during the whole 
of the sedimentary age about 750,000 miles of rain could have fallen. 
This, of course, means that by evaporation and precipitation the 
ocean waters have been used over and over again. As the water of 
the ocean is evaporated, the mineral content remains in the ocean. 
When the water runs from the continental or island areas into the 
oceans it carries in suspension or solution some solid material. The 
solids are mostly in the form of salts. The mineral content of the 
ocean waters that we now observe has been caused by this process of 
evaporation and precipitation throughout the sedimentary age. 

This transfer of water from the oceans to the continents and then 
back into the oceans would be of no consequence from a geological 
standpoint if it were not for the resulting erosion of the exposed 
surface of the earth. Much of the water runs directly to streams 
and rivers and eventually reaches tidal water, except in a few desert 
basins where the rivers have no outlet to the sea, but these latter are 
very unimportant. The ^ater that runs to the sea carries much 
material in suspension. The earth's surface is undergoing disintegra- 
tion as the result of frost and chemical action. As soon as a particle 
is loosened from a rock, it is subject to transportation to some other 
place by wind or water. The effect of water in transporting material 
is believed to be far greater than that of wind. In any cA-ent 
tremendous amounts of material in suspension are carried by water 



SHAPING THE EAETH — BOWIE 341 

to the streams and rivers. Another large part of the water that 
falls to the earth soaks into the ground and absorbs a certain amount 
of the mineral matter from the rocks. This water seeping through 
the rocks will eventually reach streams and rivers and then will flow 
to tidal waters carrying vast quantities of solid material with it. The 
combination of the material in suspension and in solution results in 
a large amount of continental matter that is transferred to sea areas 
each year. 

It has been estimated that in the United States the rate of erosion 
is approximately 1 foot in 9,000 years. Some areas, of course, have 
very much more rapid rates of erosion than others, but this is the 
average rate at which material is carried from the area of the United 
States as a whole to tidal waters. The rate of erosion for the other 
continental areas is probably just about the same as for our country. 
This may not seem to be a very rapid rate, for during historic times 
it would amount to only about one-half of a foot. The average ele- 
vation of the United States is about 2,000 feet, and so to erode all 
of the material lying above sea level would require something like 
4,000 times the total length of the historic period. 

At this rate, however, something like 30 miles of erosion could 
have occurred during the sedimentary age. Of course, there has been 
no such amount of erosion as that. A particular exposed area that is 
undergoing erosion is worn down to sea level eventually and then 
erosion ceases, but it is rather remarkable that many areas which 
have been eroded down to sea level have in a later period been raised 
up again and thus other material has been subjected to erosion. 

It seems probable that the average elevation of the continental 
areas has never been very much higher or lower than now. I believe 
that if there has been any change, the average elevation has been 
getting gradually lower. This is because the continental matter 
carried to tidal waters is less dense than the subcrustal matter which 
moves toward the continents to restore equilibrium. The average 
elevation for all of the continental and island areas of the world is 
slightly more than 2,000 feet, less than one-half mile, but there are 
some parts of the earth where the elevations are 3 or 4 miles or 
more. The maximum elevation of the Himalayan Mountains is more 
than 29,000 feet, and there are mountain peaks in South America 
and Alaska which are 20,000 feet or more in elevation. There are 
great plateaus which stand more than 2 miles above sea level. But 
these great elevations are offset by vast areas on continents and 
islands which are only slightly above sea level. The ocean basins 
have an average depth of approximately 10,000 feet. It seems rea- 
sonably certain that some of these areas have changed their depths 
during the sedimentary age. Some parts of the ocean bottoms have 



342 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

come up, while others have gone down, but I am of the opinion that 
the average difference in elevation of the ocean beds and of the 
continents, now about 2i/2 miles, has not been much less than it is now 
at any time during the sedimentary period. 

We can now, I believe, get an idea as to where some of the force 
originates which changes the configuration of the earth's surface. 
The water falling as rain carries off vast quantities of material in 
suspension and solution. It unloads certain portions of the earth's 
crust and overloads others. Some geologists have told us that as 
much as 30,000 feet, about 6 miles, of material have been eroded 
from some mountain areas. Then there are other areas on which 
as much as 40,000 feet, or nearly 8 miles, of sediments have been 
placed. The earth's materials are not strong enough to resist yield- 
ing under these great negative and positive loads. There is a bend- 
ing down of the crust under the sediments and a deflection upward 
of the crust under the areas which have undergone great erosion. 

The movement of material within the first 5 or 10 miles resulting 
from the loading and unloading by erosion and sedimentation is 
not a simple one. We do not have merely a slab of material which 
can break or bend, but a shell approximately 60 miles in thickness 
completely encircling the earth. Any distortion or change in one 
part of this shell would have an effect on all other parts of it if the 
earth's crust were of tremendous strength, but such is not the case. 
The crust must yield under comparatively small amounts of sedi- 
mentation and erosion. If this were not true, the geodetic data 
Avould certainly enable us to detect without difficulty the extent 
of the masses involved. An extra load of 1,000 feet of material over 
the Rocky Mountain area would show up at once in the gravity 
data. The absence of any large differences from normal conditions 
leads us to believe that there is surely no excess or deficiency of ma- 
terial for the whole Rocky Mountain region equivalent to a blanket 
1,000 feet in thickness. A blanket of even 500 feet of material is 
greater than can be present as an undetected excess or deficient load 
for an extensive area. We therefore may conclude, I believe, that 
a blanket of surface rock 500 feet in thickness over a large surface 
area exerts a force that is great enough to make the crust beneath 
yield. This yielding at times is so slow that the rocks will merely 
be bent and deformed, and at other times it is so rapid as to cause 
rocks to break. 

THERMAL CHANGES IN CRUST 

Isostasy is a condition of rest. Wlien the materials of the earth's 
surface are carried in great amounts from one area to another during 



SHAPING THE EARTH — BOWIE 343 

the process of erosion and sedimentation, the isostatic balance is dis- 
turbed. It is then that gravity comes into play and causes the sub- 
crustal material to move horizontally to restore the balance. We 
have evidence to show that as much as 6 or 8 miles of sediments 
have been deposited in the areas along the shores of an inland sea 
or the margin of an ocean. This load of material pushed the crust 
down into hotter regions. Each particle of crustal material reached 
a position several miles below the one it formerly occupied. The 
geoisotherms were depressed with the crustal material. Eventually, 
probably millions of years after the cessation of the sedimentation, 
the geoisotherms returned to their normal positions. In doing so, 
the crustal material which had been depressed increased in temper- 
ature, perhaps as much as 400° C. in extreme cases. 

This increase in temperature, of course, expanded all of the crust 
below the sediments. The expansion tended to be cubical, that is, in 
all directions, but the material involved was restrained from move- 
ment except in the upward direction ; hence, the result of the expan- 
sion was an uplift of the earth's surface. The amount of move- 
ment could not have been sufficient to form great mountain masses 
rising 2 or more miles high, but is it not possible that certain chem- 
ical or physical changes, other than normal expansion took place in 
the crustal material and that this independent expansion gave the 
added height to the uplifted surface? This idea is in complete har- 
mony with isostasy and I believe it has much merit. 

When an area is undergoing erosion, it is not lowered at a rate 
comparable with the rate of erosion. If a thousand feet of material 
is eroded from a mountain area, the crust below will move upward 
by the influx of subcrustal material which restores the equilibrium. 
The crust will presumably rise up 800 or 900 feet as a result of the 
1,000 feet of material taken from the surface. If a mountain area 
has an average elevation of about 2 miles, from 5 to 10 miles of 
material, or even more, will have to be eroded away, if erosion is 
the only acting agent, before the area is brought to a low level where 
erosion practically ceases. During this process every cubic yard of 
material in the crust below the erosion area will have been brought 
upward 5 or 10 miles or more into colder regions. Eventually the 
geoisotherms, which have been deflected upward, will resume their 
normal positions, and in consequence each particle of the uplifted 
crust will become colder by several hundred degrees centigrade. 
This causes contraction and the surface becomes depressed. The 
surface may be depressed even below sea level, in which case new 
material in the form of sediments will be deposited in the trough 
or basin that is formed. There is evidence that mountain areas 
have been elevated and depressed several times and the explanation 



344 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN mSTlTtJTION, 1931 

outlined above would seem to show how this oscillation can take 
place. 

We have seen from the above analysis what forces are being ex- 
erted on the materials of the earth. The movement downward of the 
crust under the sediments causes a movement of subcrustal material 
back toward the region from which the sediments were derived. The 
horizontal movement to restore the balance must occur below and not 
within the crust. What the effect is of this horizontal movement of 
subcrustal material on the surface configuration of the earth between 
the areas of erosion and sedimentation we do not know. Some think 
that perhaps much of the wrinkling of the earth's surface is due to 
this subcrustal flow. I am inclined to think that the movement of 
subcrustal material is so small in extent that there can be little effect 
of it on the surface above the crust about 60 miles in thickness. I do 
not think there is anything like a river of material flowing from the 
region below the sedimentary area to the erosion area. It is more 
likely that the moving material involves a large volume, and any 
portion moves only a very short distance. I believe that this move- 
ment of subcrustal material, which is a part of the isostatic adjust- 
ment, exerts only a minor influence on those portions of the surface 
of the earth that lie between the areas of sedimentation and erosion. 

From the above reasoning there appear to be four definite causes of 
changes in the elevation of surface areas aside from the direct effects 
of erosion and sedimentation: First, the depression of the crustal 
material under an area of sedimentation; second, the moving upward 
of crustal material to restore the balance under an area of erosion ; 
third, the expansion of crustal material which has been depressed 
by great loads of sediments; fourth, the contraction of the earth's 
crust and the sinking of the surface under an area of erosion. These 
must be the causes of many of the earthquakes of the world, although 
it would not be safe to assert that these are the only causes of earth- 
quakes and surface movements. 

Many geologists do not give as much weight as I do to effects of 
sedimentation and erosion on changes in the configuration of the 
earth's surface. Prof. C. K. Leith, in his splendid book entitled, 
" Structural Geology," published in 1923, tells us that isostasy and 
the maintenance of isostatic equilibrium are minor causes of struc- 
tural changes. He expresses his views as follows : 

So far as it is possible to generalize from this vague state of knowledge, 
it may be said that geologists are at present inclined to give principal place 
to changing rate of rotation and to the shrinkage of the earth, due to heat 
transfer from the interior outward, whether they go back to the nebular or 
planetesimal hypothesis of the origin of the earth ; that metamorphism and 
chemical changes, vulcanism, and forces tending to maintain isostatic equilib- 
rium are regarded as subordinate or contributory causes, or perhaps as special 
and local expressions of the more basic causes first indicated. 



SHAPING THE EARTH — BOWIE 345 

Leith advises the student of the earth to be cautious in any accept- 
ance of a simple and definite exphmation as to the causes of structural 
changes near the earth's surface. He claims that "The problem 
includes so many unmeasured and perhaps immeasurable factors that 
no living scientist can claim even an approximately correct perspec- 
tive ; all are groping for the light." 

I agree with Doctor Leith that the problem involved in untangling 
the geological record is a very complicated one, but I do not think 
it is wise to advise a student to avoid a simple explanation of some 
phenomena if other explanations are not available, or if the others 
are so complicated as to leave one mystified and confused. I believe 
that the only way to attack any scientific problem is to follow a lead, 
no matter how simple, until evidence may show that one is not travel- 
ing in the right direction. 

CONCLUSION 

Isostasy is now widely recognized as a scientific principle. Its 
advocates hold that there is a maintenance of the isostatic equilib- 
rium as materials are moved from one place to another over the 
earth's surface. These are the physical facts which are related to 
the processes involved in changes in the earth's surface. They have 
been proven by actual physical measurements. It has been stated 
that there are great horizontal movements in mountain areas, but 
that isostasy and its maintenance call for only vertical movements. 
My answer to this is that I recognize the horizontal movements in 
mountain areas, but believe that these horizontal movements are 
incidental to the vertical movements which are involved in main- 
taining the isostatic balance and which also result from the changes 
in the temperature of crustal matter brought about by the mainte- 
nance of equilibrium. There is an abundance of space in a mountain 
area for horizontal movements to occur, and it seems to me that it is 
easier to explain these movements as resulting from upward or down- 
ward moving material than as resulting from a shrinking interior 
of the earth and a collapsing crust. 

Isostasy is a geological problem. It was outlined by the great 
geologist, C. E. Button. It has been used by the geodesists merely 
as an effective means by which to harmonize theoretical and observed 
values of geodetic data. The geodesists hope that isostasy may 
prove of great value to geologists in their efforts to write the geolog- 
ical history of the earth. 



THE EARTH BENEATH IN THE LIGHT OF MODERN 
SEISMOLOGY ^ 



By Ernest A. Hodgson 
Dominion Ohscrvatory, Ottawa, Canada 



The earth is an object of special interest to all of us. . We are, 
indeed, attracted to it much more strongly than to any other of the 
heavenl}^ bodies, of which, we must remember, it is one. For the 
votaries of Urania to turn from their contemplation of the heavens 
above to a consideration of the earth beneath is in no sense to depart 
from their allegiance to the Muse of Astronomy. We need not seek 
to justify the propriety of presenting an address on seismology 
before an audience of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. 

A variety of circumstances make this place peculiarly appropriate 
for such a subject. We are met under the auspices of a society which 
has published more articles on seismology than any other in this 
country. We enjoy the hospitality of a university whose former 
president — Dr. J. W. (later Sir William) Dawson — made the first 
statistical studies of Canadian earthquakes.- The lecture room is 
one of those assigned to the department of physics, one of whose 
early professors — Doctor Smallwood — operated, as long ago as 1870, 
what was presumably the first seismograph to be set up on this 
continent.^ 

We are gathered on the flank of an extinct volcano, but on a rock 
foundation so solid that we should be comparatively safe in any sort 
of earthquake we may reasonably expect to experience in Canada. 
Yet within a mile of this place we can find conditions of unstable 
soil, coupled with old or shoddy workmanship which would cer- 
tainly be dangerous were we to experience now an earthquake as

severe, say, as that which on September 5, 1732, damaged some 300 
houses in Montreal alone, resulted in the death of at least one, and 
the injury of many under circumstances overwhelmingly less likely 
to prove serious than those which obtain in the same locality to-day. 
Those engaged in construction work in this country will some day 
more generally consider the known precautions with regard to 
earthquake tremors which should be observed in varying degree de- 
pending on the nature of the ground concerned. 

Our subject is not earthquakes, however, but the earth. Astron- 
omy first taught us something of our earth as a whole. That science 
was partly responsible for and greatly assisted the voyage of Colum- 
bus, which demonstrated that one could cross the Atlantic without 
at least falling off. The idea that the earth is spherical is now gen- 
eral except in Zion City, 111. Astronomy measures for us the radius 
of our planet, finding it to be about 4,000 miles, the circumference 
being nearly 25,000 miles. Astronomy mothered geodesy, which has 
demonstrated that the earth is a spheroid of the oblate order. The 
remark about the orange which invariably follows in the schoolbooks 
leaves one with an uneasy sense of a religious controversy in this 
connection. 

The shape and size of the earth being known, mathematical physics, 
also an offspring of astronomy, informs us that the average density of 
the earth is 5.6 (in c. g. s. units). It weighs, therefore, volume for 
volume, 5j% times as much as water. This statement may be taken 
as a convenient crossover to geology. Physics and allied sciences are 
able to tell us only average values for conditions within the earth — 
the average density, the elasticity as a whole, the mean value of 
gravity ; the details are notably lacking. The geologist is concerned 
with surficial details. Informed that the earth, as a whole, weighs 
a little more than S^/o times as much as an equal volume of water, 
he states that the granite, marble, limestone, dolomite, etc., which 
form the bulk of our surface rocks weigh only about half as much, 
volume for volume, as the earth as a whole and that, therefore, there 
must be much denser material below. The questions throng: How 
far down do the surface rocks extend? "VVliat distribution of den- 
sities exists within the earth? In what physical state do the mate- 
rials exist, solid, liquid, or gas? We are curious to investigate what 
lies within the earth beneath. 

The miner has the terse expression, " Beyond the pick it is dark." *

gold mine was begun in 1834. In 1924 it had reached a depth of 
6,726 feet. The bottom of this mine is not, however, the point nearest 
the center of the earth to which man has penetrated. Tlie Calumet 
and Hecla mines in Michigan, though only about 6,000 feet deep, 
reach a horizon 4,600 feet below sea level, said to be the point nearest 
the center of the earth on which man has been able to tread. The 
South American mines being in the mountains, their greater depth 
of shaft does not penetrate so far below sea level. Representing the 
radius of the earth by a line 120 miles in length — the distance from 
Montreal to Ottawa — the bottom of the Michigan mines lies at a 
point only 138 feet away. The number of deep mines or deep bores 
is small ; their cost is enormous. To what depth have you personally 
inspected the interior of the earth? 

If physics deals with generalities, geology studies details, but 
practically only surface details, as we have said. True, time has 
broken and uptilted parts of the earth's crust, exposing at the sur- 
face that which must once have lain at considerable depth. True, 
also, volcanoes bring up materials from below, though from what 
depths these materials come is not so well defined as we could wish. 
The geologist, having studied the earth's surface features, admits 
that, so far as he can learn, the average density of the surface crust 
is only about half as great as that of the earth as a whole. We leave 
him as he argues from the known to the unknown, from the ob- 
served to the conjectured, from the fact that near the surface the 
temperature increases about 1° F. for each 90 feet in depth to the 
possibility that at a depth of 40 miles the temperature may be about 
2,300° F. or the "white heat of the blacksmith's forge," « from 
measures of the elasticity and compressibility of rocks under high 
pressures in the laboratory to conjectures as to their properties 
at great depths within the earth.'^ We turn to seismology for the 
decisive tests of any theory as to the structure of the earth on which 
we live and move and have our being, from which we get our means 
of livelihood, within which we find our final resting place; the 
fortress of mystery which man has, at last, completely surrounded, 
but which he has never penetrated, nor ever shall. 

For some, an earthquake is a rare phenomenon of passing, if 
for the moment absorbing, interest; for others it is a dreaded 
nightmare of horror. To the engineer, it is a factor in his problems 
of design; to the insurance agent and the financier alike, it is a risk; 
to the newspaper man, it means business; to the geologist, it is a 
tectonic agent; to the seismologist, it is all of these and more.

350 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

Our subject requires us to consider the earthquake as a release 
of energy — the agent which despatches a signal to be registered on 
the seismograph set up at each of a network of stations distributed 
over the globe. The signals are there recorded after having trav- 
ersed the earth for various distances and along various paths, after 
having penetrated to various depths. The nature of the records 
indicates the paths by which the signals reached the instrument, 
the properties of the materials through which they passed. They 
are thus worthy of the greatest care in our choice of the network 
of stations, our design of instruments and vaults, our maintenance 
of continuous recording and accurate timing, our thoughtful study. 
These constitute the modern seismology, in the light of which we 
are to view the earth beneath. 

Our first problem may be stated thus: At what depth do earth- 
quakes release their signals? Some undoubtedly occur on the sur- 
face, though, presumably, the causal movements extend deep into the 
earth. Others leave no traces of permanent shift at the surface. 
The added fact that they are sensibly felt over wide areas indicates 
that they originate far below. We can arrive at a conclusion with 
regard to depth of focus, as it called, along different lines of rea- 
soning. Dutton ® used as a means of determining depth a considera- 
tion of the rate at which the intensity falls off as the disturbance 
spreads out in all directions from the focus and makes its effects 
apparent at the surface. He concludes that the maximum depth 
of focus is of the order of 20 miles. Walker,^ working with Galit- 
zin's measures of the angle, at which the seismic rays emerge from 
the earth at the different stations in the vicinity of the focus, de- 
duces that the depth of focus is of the order of one-fifth the earth's 
radius — 800 miles ! Omori,^° making use of the duration of the 
preliminary tremors of earthquake records deduces that the mean 
depth of earthquakes in the Kwanto province of Japan is of the 
order of 21 miles. Gutenberg ^^ studied the curve showing the time 
of arrival of the first tremors and determined for an earthquake in 
the Schwabian Alps a depth of 34 miles. A recent paper by 
Wadati " deals very thoroughly with the various methods. He finds 
that the Japanese earthquakes fall into two groups, which he terms 
respectively shallow and deep. " The deep earthquakes take place

at the depth of more than 300 km (186 miles), while the shallow 
ones at about 40 km (25 miles)," Gutenberg, in a publication 
which has just issued from the press,^^ tabulates the values of depth 
of focus as determined by nine different seismologists for 16 differ- 
ent earthquakes. With the single exception of Wadati's deep earth- 
quakes, the determinations all lie at depths of 28 miles or less. 
Seismologists generally agree that the data for determining the 
depth of focus are not as precise as could be desired, but that earth- 
quakes probably originate, in general, at depths of 25 miles or less. 

The uncertainty with regard to the depth of focus is due largely 
to our uncertainty as to the velocity of propagation of the seismic 
waves in the uppermost layer of the earth's crust. To determine 
this velocity we must have an earthquake of which we know, ac- 
curately, the time of occurrence and the depth of focus. We can 
be sure of this last requirement only where the depth is zero, i. e., 
where the. focus is at the surface. On February 18, 1911, a dis- 
turbance was registered which was traced to the Pamirs, in central 
Turkestan. Investigation showed that a great slide had occurred in 
which from Y to 10 billion metric tons of rock had fallen a dis- 
tance of from 400 to 800 yards. The tremors, registered on the 
seismographs at Ottawa and generally throughout the world, were 
believed to have been the result of the rock fall.^* The exact time 
of the fall could not be determined. Moreover it is now questioned 
whether the fall was the cause or the result of the earthquake.^^ 
Such a question could be raised in the case of practically any such 
earthquake. We fall back upon the velocity of earth tremors gen- 
erated by an explosion. 

The velocity of seismic waves has been studied in the case of a 
great explosion at Oppau, in the works of the Badische Analin und 
Sodafabrik in the Bavarian Palatinate, on September 21, 1921.^'^ 
The tremors were registered at five seismograph stations ranging in 
distance from 68 miles to 227 miles. The chord from Oppau to Do 
Bilt — the farthest station — dips only about 2 miles below the sur- 
face at the middle of the arc. We may thus consider the waves 
as being well within the upper layer of the earth. The exact time 
of the explosion is loiown within one second. The records give the 
velocity of propagation of the most rapid tremors as 5.4 km (3.35 
miles) per second.

352 ANNUAL REPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

But one swallow does not make a summer. It was desirable to 
check the value of the velocity by means of other explosion records, 
especially as the velocity as determined for waves generated by earth- 
quakes of presumably shallow focus was found to be 7.1 km (4.4 
miles) per second. Accordingly, in May, 1924,^^ four explosions, the 
first two of 10 metric tons each, of melinite, the second two of 5 
metric tons each, were exploded at La Courtine, in central France. 
The explosions being predetermined, arrangements were made to 
have precise timing and fast-speed chronographs, so that the records 
obtained were spread out sufficiently to be readily legible.^ The 
tremors were registered at three stations ranging in distance from 
3y2 to 151/2 miles. The mean value of the determined velocity for 
the most rapid tremors was found to be 5.5 km (3.4 miles) per sec- 
ond, confirming substantially the results obtained from the records 
of the Oppau explosion. 

This raises a further point. We have referred only to the veloci- 
ties of the first movement as registered on the seismograph. The 
fact that high-speed chronographs were used at La Courtine to 
spread out the record implies that there were other onsets of value. 
There were. 

Waves propagated in an elastic body (that is to say, a substance 
which has the power of recovering its shape if it is not strained 
beyond certain limits — and the earth is such a body) are of two 
kinds. The first is known as a longitudinal or dilatational type and 
the waves so propagated are called P waves, since they are the pri- 
mary or first registered. The other type is called transverse or 
distortional, the waves being termed S waves because they are the 
secondary registration in point of time. The P wave and the S 
wave each travel through the earth from the focus to the station 
by paths which may be for the present described as being somewhat 
concave upward, or as sagging below the chordal line joining the 
focus and the station. The velocity of each depends on the elastic 
properties of the earth, being greater in each case if the elasticity 
of the material along the path increases, but slowing down for an 
increase in density. The S wave has the added important charac- 
teristic that it can not be propagated through a liquid. 

The velocity of the first, fast tremor, found to be 5.4 km (3.35 
miles) per second in the case of the Oppau explosion, and 5.5 km 
(3.4 miles) per second, on the average, at La Courtine, was that of 
the longitudinal vibrations — the so-called P wave. The velocity of 
the S wave was found to be 3.1 km (1.9 miles) per second at Oppau 
and 2.8 km (1.7 miles) per second in the mean at La Courtine —

again a fair agreement. We thus have a measure of the velocity of 
propagation of the two types of waves in the uppermost layers of 
the earth's crust, based on observations of five separate explosions, 
registered at three or more stations in each case. Obviously we wish 
to add to our observational data of this nature. 

To quote from our legal friends, " time is to be the essence " of 
our experiments. The nearest of the La Courtine stations was 31/2 
miles from the blast. The first tremor, marking the time of arrival 
of the P wave, registered about one second after the explosion. The 
S wave required about two seconds to travel the same distance. The 
difference in time of arrival was thus about one second in the case

of the nearest station and about four seconds in the case of the 
farthest. To render the onset of the S wave legible it was necessary 
to record the tremors at a higher speed than that generally used for 
earthquakes. Obviously, if the distance is increased to several hun- 
dreds or thousands of miles, the difference in time of arrival will 
be increased and, moreover, slight inaccuracies in the determination 
of the exact instant of arrival of either phase will not greatly affect 
the velocity determination. 

In order to convey some idea of the manner in which the two 
types of waves make their appearance on a seismogram, the two 
groups of records of Figure 1 are shown. The arrival of P and S 
is indicated for the two seismograms of the first group. These are 



354 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

records registered at Jena and Grottingen, respectively — ^two German 
stations about 80 miles apart — of an earthquake which occurred at 
Kansu, China, about 4,600 miles from the recording stations. One 
minute of record line is indicated at the beginning of the record and 
successive minutes can be seen on the original records as breaks in 
the line, a few of which are preserved even in the reproduction. 
The difference in time of arrival of S and P is here about 8 minutes 
and 50 seconds. To obtain a record such as this a line recording 
speed of from half an inch to an inch and a half per minute would 
ordinarily be employed, depending on the seismograph used and the 
purpose of the registration. Where S and P arrive within a second 
or so of each other, as in the case of a blast or explosion, it is cus- 
tomary to have a line recording speed of 6 or 7 inches per second. 
Such a short-distance but spread out record would resemble those 
registered at Gottingen and Jena for the Kansu quake except that 
the serrations would be more numerous. 

The second group of records is also interesting. It shows the 
seismograms registered at Jena for three earthquakes, each of which 
originated in Kamchatka — about 5,300 miles distant — in October, 
1920, June, 1924, and July, 1924, respectively. This shows how 
strikingly alike are the records of the same instrument for earth- 
quakes originating at the same epicenter. 

A friend of mine, a devotee of bridge, sometimes mutters a brief 
prayer in the words, " through strength and up to weakness." Let 
us repeat this solemn incantation now in order that you may be 
properly impressed with the strength of that part of seismology 
which has become so well established that it now forms the strong 
supporting column of the seismological attack on the problem of the 
internal structure of the earth. If, at the close of this address, you 
feel that the van of that attack is occupying ground which it may 
not be able to hold indefinitely, do not forget that all will not be 
lost in any event. We are sure of some things — and rather interest- 
ing and somewhat surprising things they are, too. 

We know, from long experience, that if an earthquake takes place 
as a sharp, well-defined, single shock, it will be registered at stations 
which are more than TOO miles and less than 7,000 miles distant in 
such a manner that the arrival times of P and S can be definitely 
determined, the difference computed, and the distance from station 
to epicenter (that point on the surface vertically above the focus) 
read off from an empirical table or its graph to within 25 or 50 miles. 
F'urthermore, we can, if the stations are equipped with proper appa- 
ratus for recording absolute time, determine the time at the epi- 
center so accurately that the values derived from the records of 
stations at distances within the above limits will agree within a few 



MODERN" SEISMOLOGY — HODGSON 355 

seconds. Moreover, the distances from each of three or more 
stations being known, for any given earthquake, the position of the 
epicenter can be determined with a surprising degree of accuracy. 
And, finally, this work has been done, with ever-increasing accuracy, 
by various agencies since 1899, supplementing previous catalogues 
of felt earthquakes and giving us an analysis of the relative seis- 
micity of the different parts of the earth's surface, which is very 
good, indeed. This analysis is being continuously strengthened 
to-day by the efforts of over 200 stations, regularly operating seismo- 
graphs and publishing data. Our time distance curves are subject 
to but minor corrections for distances between TOO miles and 7,000 
miles. We know our seismic areas. The seismic history of many 
of these areas is already long continued enough to be of value in 
various lines of investigation. From this hard-won but firmly con- 
solidated position we step forward into the front-line trenches, the 
active sector of seismological research. 

To detail the various investigations which combine to give us our 
present tentative conception of the internal structure of the earth is 
beyond the limits of this address. It must suffice that, after outlining 
that conception, the seismological evidence supporting it be briefly 
inspected. The methods adopted for checking the details of the pro- 
posed earth structure will serve to give us some idea of the procedure 
by which that structure has been inferred. 

All seismologists agree that the earth has a spherically layered 
structure, consisting of a central core surrounded by a series of shells 
of different thickness, each with its own distinct properties. The 
spherical surfaces separating the various shells are probably fairly 
well defined ; that is to say, the transition is relatively sudden. They 
are referred to as surfaces of discontinuity, or simply as disconti- 
nuities. 

Let us consider first the central core. The surface of discontinuity 
surrounding it is believed to lie about 2,900 km (1,800 miles) beneath 
our feet, or a little less than half the distance to the center of the 
earth. The material of the core is believed to be iron, with probably 
some nickel as well. If our earth is made of the stuff of which other 
worlds are made (and that seems a reasonable assumption) and if the 
meteors which occasionally fall to the earth are to be regarded as 
samples of that material then we may infer a mixture of iron and 
nickel for the central core. Here we have a large part of the extra 
density demanded by the physicist to make up for the light surface 
rocks and average up the density of the earth to the 5.6 which he 
demands. The existence of the core is rather well established. The 
P waves are refracted into its surface in such a manner that they fail 
102992—32 24

ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 



to reach stations which are between Y,000 miles and 10,000 miles of the 
epicenter, leaving the so-called blind zone as shown in Figure 2. 

In what state is the iron of the core — solid, liquid, or gas? The 
question is still an open one. The fact that the S wave will not be 
transmitted through a liquid or a gas suggests that we apply that 
criterion. This is not as easy as might be supposed. Some seismol- 
ogists believe the S wave has been identified after transmission 
through the core. Most are agreed, however, that it has not been 
positively identified, and some are frankly of the opinion that the 
central core is liquid or gas. It is supposed to be dense, under high 
pressure, of course, but not an elastic solid. The velocity of the 
P wave is high for the layer just outside the central core — about

characteristic longitudinal waves. (Adapted from Gutenberg's contribution to 
Borntracger's llandbuch der Geophysili. See footnote 13) 

13 km (8 miles) per second. Within the core it drops suddenly 
to 8.5 km (5.3 miles) per second. Does the density suddenly increase 
as you pass into the core, or does the elasticity become markedly 
less? Alwa3's we are left with questions, unanswered as yet but not 
unanswerable. Of such is the kingdom of research. Without them 
we should develop an orthodoxy of science which would be fatal. 
The surface of discontinuity at the central core is, as has been 
noted, well defined. It is indicated by the " blind zone " and also 
by the sudden drop in velocity, which, in turn, indicates either a 
sudden increase in density or a rapid falling off in elasticity or a 
combination of these. The fact that there is a sudden drop in 
velocity is deduced mathematically from the observational data of 
earthquake records — the so-called time-distance or travel-time curves.

recent book by Gutenberg (pp. 32-80 of reference 13) outlines the 
work of recent writers on this subject. There is no other such well- 
marked sudden change of velocity with increase in depths as that 
which occurs at the entrance to the core. The other changes are less 
abrupt and are, in general, increases in velocity. The other dis- 
continuities are thus not so well established, in fact or in position, as 
is that at about half way down the earth's radius. 

Ascending from the 2,900 km level we traverse, in turn, three 
layers of slightly different properties, the two discontinuites sep- 
arating them being so ill defined that we are not sure where — or 
even whether — they are. The discontinuity which surrounds the 
triple layer is at a depth of 1,200 km (750 miles). The material 
composing these three layers is supj^osed to be silicon impregnated 
with iron. The iron content is supposed to increase for points suc- 
cessively nearer the core, and to be very small at the outer boundary 
at the 1,200 km discontinuity. The three ill-defined layers, taken 
together, constitute what is known as the transition layer. The 
transition layer and the core, taken together, are sometimes known 
as the " nif e " (ni=nickel: fe=ferrum=iron). 

The next discontinuity is much better marked; its existence is 
certain; there is some uncertainty as to its position. It may chance 
to be different in different parts of the world. Much remains to 
be done in its investigation. The break is usually held to be at a 
depth of 60 km (37 miles). It marks the upper boundary of the 
shell of silica and magnesium usually designated as the " sima " (the 
name indicating the constituents). The increase in velocity with 
depth within this layer is so uniform that it is not believed to suffer 
any internal discontinuities. The density inevitably increases some- 
what with depth due to the superimposed weight ; the elasticity must 
thus gradually increase downward at a fairly uniform rate in the 
sima, and at a less regular rate in the transitional layer of the nife 
until finally we get the great reversal, the fall in velocity, at the 
central core. Let us come back toward the surface and nearer home. 
What is the constitution of the upper GO km (37 miles) of the 
earth's crust? 

Jeffreys ^^ believes that there are three layers, separated by dis- 
continuities at depths of 12 km (7.5 miles) and 37 km (23 miles). 
These he terms, in order descending, the granitic layer, the basaltic 
layer, and the ultrabasic layer, thus indicating the probable nature 
of their constituent rocks. The three taken together are known as 
the " sial " (si = silicon; al=aluminum).

To sum up, then, beginning at the surface and continuing down- 
ward, we have, in order, a layer of granitic rock 12 km (7.5 miles) 
in thickness; 25 km (15.5 miles) thickness of basalt; a 23-km (14 
miles) layer of ultrabasic rocks; 1,140 km (700 miles) of silicon- 
magnesium — the sima; a transition layer of silicon impregnated 
with iron, of a total thickness of 1,700 km (1,060 miles) ; and, 
finally, a great nickel-iron core of radius 3,470 Ian (2,150 miles). 
The best marked discontinuities are those at 60 km and at 2,900 km. 

Figure 3 shows in schematic form the various layers.

generated by explosions. If you look over the edge and into a cup, 
diagonally so as to just miss seeing a coin placed in the bottom of 
the cup at the side nearest, and then pour water into the cup, the 
coin becomes visible, due to the bending of the light ray as it passes 
from the water into the air — a phenomenon of refraction. The echo 
is a familiar example, in sound, of the phenomenon of reflection. 
Earthquake waves are refracted in passing from material of given 
density and elasticity into a second with different properties, i. e.,

in crossing a discontinuity. They are reflected on reaching the sur- 
face or at the inner side of the great discontinuity at 2,900 km 
depth. Seismologists name the various phases appearing on their 
records according to the paths they have probably taken. For ex- 
ample ScPc PcS represents a wave which began as a transverse 
vibration, traversed the discontinuity at the core (c) ; went on as 
a P wave but was totally reflected at the inner face of the 2,900 km 
discontinuity; proceeded as P; again traversed the core and com- 
pleted its journey to the seismograph as a transverse wave. Figure 
2 shows some of the waves going directly through the core, re- 
fracted but not reflected. These are designated the P' waves.

Near the surface we have a multiplicity of refractions. Figure 4

It will be seen that we have a very large number of wave arrivals 
on our seismogram ; at least that we may expect many. As a matter 
of fact, some arrive with such small energy content that they register 
but faintly. This, nevertheless, affords a further check on the theory, 
as that theory attempts to predict which waves should register thus. 
The proposed structure may thus be checked in many ways by means 
of longitudinal and transverse internal or body waves of earthquakes. 
We have not mentioned that there are also two types, at least, of 
surface waves. These also serve to throw light on the study of the

outer earth shells. Time fails for us to enter on a discussion of what 
is known as seismic prospecting, by means of which commercial 
interests probe the upper 4,000 feet or so of the earth's crust in the 
search for oils and minerals. They delineate many of the details of 
the upper layers, but, from a purely scientific standpoint, the most 
interesting result is the large mass of data showing the relation of 
the wave velocity and the type of material traversed. 

AVe have outlined, then, the present theory of the structure of the 
interior of the earth and indicated the means by which it is to be 
checked and improved through a study of seismic waves. If a later 
modification of the theory should give traveltime curves more nearly 
in accord with later and more accurate data, the modification will be 
adopted. The present theory is (in the language of the automobile 
prospectus) the latest model, which we take pleasure in exhibiting at 
this time. We hope it will find its way into the hands of many and 
that they may enjoy the fullest service in its use. It may be traded 
in as soon as suggested improvements have been found worthy of 
adoption. All may rest assured that when better theories of the 
internal structure of the earth are built, seismology will build them. 



COMING TO GRIPS WITH THE EARTHQUAKE PROBLEM

Geodetic Survey 

[With 8 plates] 

On February 2, 1931, we had another reminder that the problem 
of safeguarding cities against damage from severe earthquakes is 
as yet unsolved when the beautiful coast resort city of Napier, North 
Island, New Zealand, was nearly destroyed by a great earthquake. 
This earthquake also demonstrated that in designing structures to 
resist earthquakes the possible cumulative effects of a number of 
severe shocks must not be overlooked, since there were at least three 
aftershocks comparable with the main shock. 

The earthquake is always of absorbing interest to the seismologist, 
but we are rapidly approaching a condition in which the heretofore 
sporadic interest of the average citizen is being converted into con- 
tinuous interest in many parts of the earth, and accordingly the 
engineer and architect in the regions concerned are beginning to be 
quite as much interested as the seismologist. 

The two fields of activity w^ith regard to earthquakes — geophysics 
and engineering — although having different purposes, are not inde- 
pendent, and results in either field may throw light on the problems 
of the other. Prominent engineers have begun to criticize the seis- 
mologist for not giving them the information that they need, and 
the time now seems ripe for closer coordination of activity. 

From the viewpoint of the geophysicist, earthquake investigation 
is for the purpose of learning all that there is to know about the 
nature of the earthquake itself as a physical phenomenon and the 
transmission of waves, and, incidentally, the nature of the trans- 
mitting medium, with consequent information about the interior of 
the earth, which is obtainable in no other way. From the view- 
point of the engineer, the important factors are the probable occur- 
rence of a severe eartliquake in a given locality, the effect of earth-

quakes on structures, and the design of structures to resist or reduce 
destruction by earthquakes. Tliere is particular interest in regard 
to the large structures which modern civilization makes necessary, 
such as office buildings, factories, bridges, high dams, and other 
structures. 

For a number of years engineers have been gathering information 
regarding earthquake effects on structures and to some extent are 
basing design of structures on the observed facts. At Stanford Uni- 
versity they are operating a large shaking table on which types of 
structure and models of buildings are tested under conditions simu- 
lating earthquakes. With all this, they feel the need of more exact 
knowledge in regard to motions of strong earthquakes, a demand 
which the seismologists have not yet met. 

The reason for this is a practical one. Seismologists, like engi- 
neers, have to be practical. Severe earthquakes are of relatively 
infrequent occurrence at any given place, even where great damage 
has occurred in the past. Instruments suited to record strong mo- 
tions will not record weak ones. Accordingly, in order that we 
may have material with which to work, the instruments must be 
able to record earthquake waves coming from a considerable dis- 
tance, but instruments able to do this will not record strong motion. 
The valuable information which the seismologist has been able to 
obtain about the interior of the earth has been accompanied by the 
introduction of many perplexing problems. It is, therefore, not 
surprising that much energy has gone into perfecting instruments 
and methods for recording distant earthquakes. In fact, the prin- 
cipal problems in this field are well on the way to solution, though 
we may continue to expect new instruments and methods from time 
to time. 

The seismologist in developing these instruments has acquired 
much information which is useful for the design of the more rugged 
and relatively insensitive instruments which must be used to record 
strong motion. His knowledge of wave transmission will also be 
essential to the correlation of the information regarding strong 
motions when available. It is for the engineer to state exactly 
what information he needs and to make use of it after it has been 
obtained. The seismologist by his previous accomplishment has 
justified the confidence of the engineer in his ability to solve the 
problems. 

This accomplishment has included both instrumental development 
and the development of theories to explain the complexities of the 
records in terms of transmission through the earth and, consequently, 
reasonable deductions about the physical conditions of the other- 



THE EABTHQUAKE PROBKEM HECK 363 

wise unexplored medium through which the waves pass — the interior 
of the earth. 

Tlie working tool of the seismologist is the seismograph. The 
present seismographs, several types of which will be described, have 
as their purpose as accurate recording as possible of the earth 
motions during an earthquake. They have been developed from 
the simple pendulum and many of them employ the principle of the 
horizontal jDendulum. In this the weight or mass which corre- 
sponds to the pendulum bob is held at a distance from a vertical 
support by means of a boom which rests against a point near the 
bottom of the support through a pivot to reduce friction. A diag- 
onal wire from the weight to a point near the top of the support 
carries the weight. The system is then a triangle free to swing 
with one side as a nearly vertical axis (pi. 1, fig. 2). In an 
actual earthquake the earth and the vertical support move and 
through inertia the mass remains momentarily at rest. It is known 
as a steady mass. If the earthquake continues the mass will take 
up motion and provision must be made for this. In any case the 
record or seismogram is a result of the different motions of the 
earth and of the steady mass. The developments of the past 50 
years have been directed toward securing the best solution of the 
problem and toward refinements which give the desired accuracy for 
recording distant earthquakes. 

Earthquakes occur in a 3-dimensional medium and waves approach 
the seismometer from different directions according to relation of 
position of earthquake to that of instrument. In the case of the 
horizontal pendulum the record will be quite different if the axis 
of the boom is directed toward or away from the earthquake or at 
right angles to this line. Obviously the instrument must have a 
permanent position, so the plan has been adopted of having two 
instruments at right angles to each other and also, where possible, 
a third instrument to respond to vertical waves. Formerly the hori- 
zontal instruments were placed in north-south and east-west direc- 
tions. The practice is now being developed of having the axis of 
one boom point in the direction from which the greatest number of 
earthquakes may be expected and the other is set at right angles to 
this. For convenience we speak of the three components of a seismo- 
graph, though each is a complete instrument in itself. Even though 
the practice of directing the axis of one component as stated helps 
to simplify the record, the results are not entirely satisfactory and 
it is a very difficult problem to analyze completely the records of an 
earthquake arriving from some other direction than those of the 
two axes. 



364 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

Honzontal component instrument. — In most of these the principle 
of the horizontal pendulum is used. For stability combined with 
high sensitivity the line joining the upper and lower points of sup- 
port must be slightly out of the vertical. Adjustments are provided 
to make this possible. 

Damping. — In order to prevent the seismograph from oscillating 
in its own natural period and producing a very complicated record, 
the pendulum is damped, which means that a suitable vane attached 
to it moves in an oil w^ell, an air pocket, or in a magnetic field, any 
of which will serve as a brake. If the period of the earthquake and 
that of an undamped pendulum are equal or nearly equal, resonance 
is set up and the pendulum movement as recorded has no relation to 
the earth movement. Damping can not be perfectlj^ effective, but 
the aim of the seismologist is to make the damping arrangement as 
effective as possible. 

Magnification. — In the case of distant earthquakes the actual 
ground movement, if it were directly recorded, would be invisible 
for all but the very strongest earthquakes. For near earthquakes of 
considerable strength, the magnification must be small. There is 
in practice a wide range of requirements. Various instruments use 
magnifications of approximately 1,200, 700, 150, and 5 or 2. For 
special purposes magnification of 1,000,000 has been used. By optical 
or mechanical means the actual movement of the mass or, rather, of 
the supporting frame with respect to the mass, can be multiplied to 
a considerable degree, and this is known as static magnification. For 
a record the magnification to be used differs from this and the so- 
called harmonic magnification varies with periods of earth wave and 
instrument and with the damping, and therefore for the same instru- 
ment magnification will vary with the earth period. 

Period. — The period is the interval of time between two successive 
passages of a pendulum through the position of rest in the same 
direction. For recording near-by earthquakes, short-period instru- 
ments are used, both on account of the short periods to be recorded 
and because of the necessary optical and mechanical requirements to 
obtain the desired magnification. In the case of distant earthquakes 
there is a wide range of periods and several might be chosen for 
the instrument. Periods of 12 to 15 seconds are in quite general use. 
Vertical cormponcnt instruments. — In these a mass is supported by 
a spring, and the difficulty is to secure stability along with great 
sensitivity, large magnification, long period, and freedom from 
changes due to temperature. 

Time. — The accuracy of the time is of great importance. Uniform 
speed of rotation is one element and absolute time is another, and 
both must be satisfactory. Even with the best of apparatus small 



THE EARTHQUAKE PROBLEM HECK 365 

departures from uniform rotation are likely and, therefore, it is 
desirable to have all components record on one drum or on several 
drums on the same shaft (pi. 2, fig. 2), The same activitj'' vs^ill 
not then be recorded at different times because of variation in speed 
of several independent drums, and this is an advantage even if the 
absolute time is in error. Time marks from a good clock are placed 
on the record and time signals by radio are recorded directly on the 
seismograms, and if this can be done with sufficient frequency errors 
can be kept small (pi. 3, fig. 1). Eev. James B. Macelwane, S. J., 
in a paper before the section of seismology. International Geodetic 
and Geophysical Union, last summer stressed the importance of time 
and showed that there is grave danger of assumption at many seis- 
mological stations that the accuracy is greater than it actually is. 

Galvanometric recording systems. — In such systems the boom, in 
addition to carrying the mass, has a coil which moves in the field 
of a strong magnet. The currents set up are recorded through 
a galvanometer. This system has the advantages that high mag- 
nification can be readily obtained, damping is not difficult, and 
tilting of the pier is not recorded on the record. Also, it is at times 
a great advantage to have the seismometer at a place specially 
suited to this purpose and the recorder at another place at some 
distance away, where conditions are better suited for recording. 
The distance may be considerable if conditions require it. 

In the case of most horizontal component instruments with long 
periods, as 12-15 seconds or more, tilting of the pier may seriously 
confuse the record. The effect is to put successive lines on the record 
too far apart or, more serious, to crowd them so close that an earth- 
quake record can not be interpreted. This tilt is usually due to 
local temperature effects on the building or on the pier itself. The 
effect of tilting is eliminated in the galvanometric recording system 
and in the case of short period instruments, and it is very desirable 
to eliminate it on other types. This has been accomplished success- 
fully in an instrument which will be described later. 

Examples of instruments which emhody these pri?iciples. — The 
Wood-Anderson torsion seismometer, through the use of a very small 
cylindrical mass or a vane attached to a vertical fiber under tension 
is able to get a short period with high magnification and so is able 
to respond to and to magnify ground movements of very short 
period. It is probably the best instrument in existence for the study 
of near-by earthquakes. It was developed at Pasadena, Calif., for 
the special studies that are being made there. Wliile ordinarily 
operated at a period of less than 1 second, it has been operated at 
6 seconds, and the Coast and Geodetic Survey is operating such an 
instrument at Tucson, Ariz. It not only gives good records of dis- 



366 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

tant earthquakes, but gives useful records of earthquakes at moderate 
distances, as in the Imperial Valley and elsewhere in southern Cali- 
fornia and adjacent Mexico, so that the records are useful in connec- 
tion with the special investigations being made in southern 
California (pi. 3, fig. 2). 

Galvanometric recording is used in the Wenner seismometer, 
developed by Dr. Frank Wenner, of the Bureau of Standards (pi. 2, 
fig. 1). This instrument has been fully described in publications of 
the Bureau of Standards - available to anyone interested. It is oper- 
ated at high magnification and gives exceptionally good records, ex- 
cept when microseisms interfere with interpretation of the records. 
Microseisms are small oscillations set up at times in the earth's crust, 
and, according to various investigators, are to be attributed to effect 
of breakers on the coasts, and, more probably, to passing areas of 
considerable range in barometric pressure. They may last for several 
days and in the case of instruments of high sensitivity may make it 
impossible to interpret a superimposed earthquake record. These in- 
struments are installed at San Juan, P. R., at the observatory of the 
Coast and Geodetic Survey, at the Cathedral of Learning at Pitts- 
burgh, Pa., and will soon be installed at the station of the Massa- 
chusetts Institute of Technology near Machias, Me., and at the ob- 
servatory of the Coast and Geodetic Survey at Sitka, Alaska, and also 
in the new Franklin Institute Museum in Philadelphia. 

The McCorab-Romberg tilt compensation seismometer has tilt 
compensation in effective form (pi. 1, fig. 2). The instrument 
has been developed by H. E. McComb, of the Coast and Geodetic 
Survey, using a principle developed by Arnold Romberg, now of 
the University of Texas, but at the University of Hawaii when 
he did the work (pi. 4). The instrument has photographic record- 
ing with relatively simple and compact optical system, oil damp- 
ing, and magnification of about 150. Its distinctive feature is oil 
coupling between boom and recording mirror. The mirror, which is 
horizontal, has a vertical stem or shaft which carries a vane. The 
vane is free to move in a long rectangular container of castor oil, 
which is attached to the steady mass. The mirror is pivoted on a 
horizontal axis so that it tilts with every movement of the vane. All 
rapid movements are transmitted from liquid to vane as if the con- 
nection were rigid. If, however, owing to tilt, the boom takes a new 
position, the vane drifts through the liquid with the mirror remaining 
horizontal. Since the tilt and drift are both very slow, the record is 
not affected.

THE EARTHQUAKE PEOBLEM HECK 367 

With the instruments that have been described or others with 
similar characteristics, it is possible to have seismograms to meet the 
needs of particular investigations. 

It would appear at first thought that there would be such a 
complexity of waves from an earthquake that they could not be sorted 
out. However, through absorption of energy and the results of re- 
flections and refractions within the earth or at its surface only certain 
waves have sufficient energy to arrive. The definite arrivals of these

wave and the transverse or slower-speed wave is a measure of the distance 
from the earthquake to the seismological station 

so-called phases are indicated by sudden or gradual increases of 
amplitude or by sudden change of period, or both, and these form an 
orderly succession, some of which can be distinguished in all intel- 
ligible records. Since many of those present have probably not gone 
far into the subject, I will recapitulate the principal facts. 

We have the preliminary tremors, designated P for primus, which 
are longitudinal ; that is, with vibration in the direction of progress. 
These follow a direct path from earthquake to recording station, but 
a curved one, dipping somewhat below the straight line connecting 
these two points. Their velocity near the surface is 7 to 8 kilometers 



368 



ANNUAIv REPORT SMITHSONIAIT INSTITUTION, 19 31 



per second and their ordinary period 5 to 7 seconds. The second 
preliminary, designated S for secundiis, is a transverse wave vrith 
vibrations at right angles to direction of progress. The velocity 
near the surface is about 4.5 kilometers per second and the period is 
11 to 13 seconds. The path is approximately that of the P wave. 

Reflections of these waves may occur at the earth's surface at the 
halfway point or even at two points, respectively, one-third and two- 
thirds of the way with sufficient energy to be recorded. The first 
case is designated as PRi, SRi, and the latter PRa and SRo- 

The longitudinal waves which pass along the surface are more 
complex. Their speed is 3 to 4 kilometers per second, according to 




Figure 2. — Paths of earthquake waves and types of seismogram at different distances 

from an epicenter 

There may be one or more reflections of the different waves at the surface and these 
reflected waves reach the seismograph station later than the unreflected waves. Such 
phases may he recognized on some seismograms, their prominence depending upon 
the distance to the epicenter, path over which the waves (ravel, component, etc. 
Insert : In some cases the phases on different components of the seismograph are so 
well defined that the direction of the epicenter may be estimated from the ratio of 
the amplitudes recorded by two instruments operating at right angles to each other. 



conditions. The velocity for a path entirely beneath the Pacific 
Ocean is about 20 per cent greater than under the continents. The 
directions of vibrations are more varied than for the preliminary 
weaves. The periods vary greatly and may be very large, as 40 
seconds or even a minute. 

While much more might be said, these statements give the essential 
facts. It is not, however, the whole story. When the distance 
exceeds 10,000 kilometers, the waves pass through the central metallic 
core of the earth, and this modifies the paths so that the system of 
phases that has been described is replaced by another. However, 
since my purpose is to discuss the central and surrounding region of 
an earthquake, I will not go into this. 



THE EARTHQUAKE PROBLEM HECK 369 

The actual use of the complex phases is made possible through 
diagrams with distances plotted as ordinates and intervals in seconds 
from time of origin of the earthquake as abscissas. Tables are also 
used in which time intervals from time of the earthquake to arrival 
of the given phase, or intervals between successive phases, are given 
for each distance. Perliaps the most convenient tables that have 
been developed are those of Rev. James B. Macelwane, S. J., of St. 
Louis University. However, not all tables are in full agreement, and 
seismologists are still working on the best values to adopt in some 
cases. 

An important use of these diagrams and tables is to obtain distance 
of station from earthquake in order that the earthquake epicenter 
may be known. The epicenter is the point on the surface directly 
beneath which the earthquake occurred. This can be located in 
several ways but the graphical method of plotting on a large globe 
need alone be mentioned. The positions of seismological stations 
are marked on the globe and, by means of compasses, arcs are 
swung from each for the given distance of the earthquake. The 
intersection of the arcs gives the position of the earthquake (pi. 5). 
Some years ago little use was made except of records giving 
clear P and S phases. Now earthquakes can be located when these 
phases are lacking on all available records. Such a location was 
made of an earthquake in China, which later was found to agree with 
the determination made from all available data, including those of 
near stations. An adopted epicenter must meet the requirement of 
reasonably good intersection of the arcs, and the times of origin of 
the earthquake as computed from the several records must be in good 
agreement. 

The tables and curves have been derived from study of records and 
from theory. Certain assumptions are made, and if these agree with 
a large mass of observational results they are held to be valid. 

In this way a solution can be found for the distribution of density 
within the earth. Knowing the surface density and the mean density 
as given by astronomy, a distribution can be worked out which fits 
the velocity of seismic waves at all distances. 

If the observations fit adopted curves through a wide range and 
then the agreement suddenly disappears, an explanation must be 
found; in this w^ay the existence of certain layers of discontinuity has 
been postulated. ' We do not know exactly what the significance of a 
layer of discontinuity is, that is, whether there is a change in physical 
conditions or in chemical composition, though there is evidence in 
favor of both. We know from seismic evidence that such layers exist 
because the characteristics of recorded earthquake waves can not 
otherwise be explained. The best known and most definite of these is 



370 ANNUAX. REPORT SMITHSONIAN" INSTITUTION, 19 31 

the one at 2,900 kilometers that bounds the central core of the earth 
which geologists believe to be of iron and nickel. The ability of this 
core to change path and energy of the earthquake waves is beyond 
argument. It has also been held that the interior, though at very 
high pressure and temperature, behaves like a liquid in its inability to 
transmit any but longitudinal waves. Transverse waves are practi- 
cally lacking, though Doctor Macelwane ^ has recently found evidence 
that they may exist. 

Of more importance to our discussion are layers near the surface. 
These are not so definite and there is more difference of opinion. In 
records of near-by earthquakes there are often two P phases and 
sometimes three, and the same may be true of S. An explanation is 
called for. The first was that of Mohorovicic who postulated a layer 
of discontinuity 60 kilometers beneath the continents, and this seemed 
to give fairly good agreement with observations (fig. 2). Changes

in velocity throughout the layer, taking place in a manner similar to 
that worked out for the deep interior of the earth, were necessary. 
Observations of submarine earthquakes gave evidence of a much 
thinner layer beneath the oceans and this in turn corresponds to the 
faster surface waves beneath the oceans which have been mentioned. 

Seismologists in general had accepted this conclusion almost uni- 
versally when Jeffreys suggested a different explanation. As shown 
in Figure 4, his theory calls for two layers of discontinuity about 10 
and 30 kilometers, respectively, below the surface. Most of the 
energy passes along these surfaces and the velocity of the waves 
remains nearly constant throughout their paths. Seismic prospectors 
use a somewhat similar theory for layers very near the surface. 
Investigations in California fit Jeffreys' theory very well.

THE EARTHQUAKE PROBLEM HECK 371 

The consideration of these layers brings us to a very important 
question — the depth of focus or depth beneath the surface at which 
tlie eartliquake occurs. This is of importance in the case of distant 
earthquakes, but it is far more important for those occurring near by. 
Theoretically there should be important differences in the records of 
two earthquakes at the epicentral distances of, for example, 200 
kilometers, but with one having a depth of 20 kilometers and the 
other 40. 

Methods for determining depth of focus are not yet satisfactory, 
and in order that such determinations may be undertaken, there must 
be a large number of precise records from near-by stations and time 
must be accurately measured to the nearest tenth second. The latter 
requirement is met at very few stations and the former only in parts 
of Europe and in Japan, though before long the eastern and extreme

continuity and the velocities remain practically constant along such a path 

western portions of the United States should meet this requirement. 
Sieberg * gives for a European earthquake depths ranging from 138 
to 40 kilometers, according to the method adopted, with 45 to 60 
as the most probable. Gutenberg arrives at 60 kilometers as about 
the average depth for moderately severe earthquakes. 

In the case of the Japanese earthquake of September 1, 1923, 
there were enough records made by strong motion instruments with 
three components near by so that a simple method, and one inde- 
pendent of time, could be adopted. The observations ^ were so near 
the epicenter that it could be assumed that the angle of emergence 
of the waves gave directly the direction of the focus on the assump- 
tion of straight-line transmission. The distance of observation points 
from epicenter ranged from 70 to 132 kilometers. The depths 
ranged from 35 to 55 kilometers with 48 as the average. This is

interesting in view of Gutenberg's adopted 50 kilometers. This 
method becomes uncertain at distances greater than 200 kilometers 
both because the ratio of depth to distance is becoming small and 
because straight-line transmission can no longer be assumed. There 
is still much work to be done on this problem. 

When we come to the central region of strong earthquakes, we 
find conditions of great complexity. Observations by adequate 
instruments are so few that we are driven to study earthquake effects 
as the best guide to what has occurred, a method obviously defective. 
Men under mental stress are not capable of making observations 
with the impartial attitude of a machine. However, invaluable 
information is obtained from such reports and when a phenomenon 
is reported by many witnesses which seems to conflict with the known 
principles of earthquake wave behavior, a careful investigation 
should be made. As an illustration, in regions of deep alluvium 
or of a moderately thick layer of soft material, earthquake waves 
have been seen to pass over the ground in a manner similar to the 
ground swell of the ocean. In the case of the California earthquake 
of 1906, 16 persons in as many different localities reported seeing 
such AA^aves. Similar reports were made in the case of the Porto 
Rican earthquake of 1918, and there have been many other examples. 

At first thought this might seem not unreasonable, but it must 
be remembered that while earthquake waves travel at least 2 miles 
per second, the ocean swell rarely exceeds 65 feet p^r second. It 
is therefore difficult to comprehend how we can see the waves pass 
along. Crests of such waves have been reported as 2 feet above the 
troughs, but, even if the phenomenon is genuine, the probability 
is that the height does not exceed 6 inches. It will be interesting 
to learn the facts by instrumental observation. In some cases a 
series of parallel cracks in the earth have been found parallel to 
the crest of the reported waves. Even then the waves may be an 
illusion due to the effect of the earthquake itself on the observer. 

Railroad tracks sometimes afford evidence that strong forces have 
been at work. In some cases the distortion appears to have been 
due to shortening, but it is not clear how this shortening has been 
brought about. No effort has been made to analyze the forces. 
The directions taken by falling monuments in cemeteries bear 
witness to the variations in the forces at work. Often the majority 
will fall in the same directions, but the remainder will fall at an 
angle with, or even at right angles to, the prevailing direction. 
There are many striking examples of turning of a monument on 
its base, or even of different parts of a monument by different 
amounts, but without fall. 



THE EAKTHQUAKE PROBLEM HECK 373 

The effects on buildings are of interest. In many cases the 
destruction is so great or the faihire so varied that they are not 
instructive. Much can be learned, however, from study of selected 
details. It is, however, very difficult to deduce the actual earth 
movements in this way on account of the complexity and variation 
in the stress applied and our lack of knowledge as to just what 
part of the activity produced given results. But even then much 
can be learned, and a large part of existing effort to prevent damage 
from earthquakes has been obtained from the study of damaged 
buildings. ]\Iuch work has been done in Japan by the Earthquake 
Kesearch Institute and other organizations, and buildings are being 
erected which are expected to resist destruction or even serious 
damage. The report of the great earthquake of September 1, 1923, 
contains much valuable information, but is not yet available in 
English. 

The acceleration of the ground movement is the rate of change 
in its velocity and it appears to be closely related to the destruc- 
tiveness of an earthquake. While there are many other complicat- 
ing factors, engineers in designing structures have generally ac- 
cepted acceleration as the principal element to consider constants in 
the formulas which are not satisfactorily known. One of the most 
important of these is the maximum acceleration; without certain 
knowledge of this, the engineer is not sure of his factor of safety. 

We have all sorts of statements as to the relation between acceler- 
ation and damage, and the so-called Mercalli-Cancani scale of earth- 
quake intensity is a double scale of equivalents. Engineers are be- 
ginning to adopt 0.1 acceleration of gravity for maximum horizontal 
and 1/20 g for vertical acceleration. In Italy higher values have 
been adopted up to 1/6 g. This must be considered in the light of 
the fact that we have few instrumental determinations of accuracy. 

There has been no lack of effort to make such determinations. A 
favorite device consists of a series of small columns side by side so 
arranged that each will fall when a given acceleration has been 
reached. The information given by such a device is limited to a 
single observation with the time of occurrence unknown and we can 
never be certain whether the last column to fall (that responding 
to the highest acceleration) has responded to the proper maximum 
or whether a rapid series of impulses of lower acceleration have not 
through resonance caused the column to fall. 

Other attempts have been made to deduce the maximum accelera- 
tion from the fall of objects. Here again we do not know w^hether 
there has been a single impulse or the accumulated effect of several. 
A typical example of the straits to which seismologists and engineers 
have been driven is the attempt of Bailey Willis to deduce this in- 



374 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN" INSTITUTION, 1931 

formation in the case of the Chile earthquake of 1922 from the fall 
of boundary walls of adobe. Unfortunately, the bottoms of the walls 
were weathered and somewhat rounded and this vitiated the con- 
clusions. It is obvious that instrumental observations alone will give 
the true values of the acceleration. Acceleration, however, can not 
stand alone as the cause of destruction. It is the combination of 
acceleration, period, duration of the shock, and perhaps the num- 
ber of periods of strong shock which causes the destruction. Im- 
amura ^ gives an example of an earthquake occurring in March, 
1930, in Japan where the recorded acceleration was 0.8 g, but the 
period and duration were both very short and no serious damage 
was done. It is obvious that records to be useful must give all these 
factors accurately. 

These observations, when made, should be competent to decide the 
question of the existence of surface waves of considerable ampli- 
tude and of low velocity which have been mentioned. It is also 
important to learn more about the differences in the effects of earth- 
quakes which rupture the surface and those which are of great in- 
tensity but too deep to cause such rupture. Of particular interest 
are the vibrations set up by visible slipping along a fault plane. It 
would be of great interest to know just what is the difference in 
the transmission of energy in earthquakes of this type from that in 
such cases as earthquakes associated with volcanic eruptions in which 
the energy appears to go out equally in every direction. 

Observations of a few strong earthquakes in their central regions 
will not solve all these and other problems. The possible number 
of combinations are very great. However, with an effective program 
the accumulation of information will be steady. 

The recent New Zealand earthquake (February 2, 1931) has shown, 
as have many others, that certain t5^pes of earthquake damage are 
inevitable. Types of construction matter little if the building is 
directly over a fault line with horizontal or vertical slipping or in the 
path of a great landslide. If a great tidal wave occurs buildings in 
its path will be swept away. However, for most earthquakes the 
number of buildings exposed to these special hazards is not a large 
proportion, and the most common needs are ability to resist strong 
shocks and fire prevention. In both these fields there are important 
possibilities. Earthquakes are no more numerous or more severe 
than in the past, but the earth is so much more intensively occupied 
that the risk of important damage is greater than ever before and 
is constantly increasing.

The problem, then, is prevention of disaster due to moderately 
severe earthquakes and reduction of damage due to great ones. Engi- 
neers are beginning to agree that major structures should be designed 
with regard to earthquake stress if the history of the region indi- 
cates that they are likely to be subjected to such stress. They are 
recoo-nizino: the lack of information and are demanding that more 
accurate information be obtained.

engineers will be made in this region. This does not mean that this 
is the only part of the United States where strong earthquakes may 
occur. In fact, the most severe earthquakes in this countr}'^ during 
the past five years have been in the East, but it is a region where 
earthquakes of severity have occurred in a number of localities and 
therefore with suitable distribution of instruments earlier results 
may be anticipated there than elsewhere. Furthermore, the demand

for this work comes from that part of the country where a sentiment 
of wise preparedness for possible emergency is being developed. 

The purpose is to install instruments capable of recording accu- 
rately strong earthquake motions in places where history indicates 
that there is probability of earthquake activity of some intensity. 
It is regrettable that such instruments were not installed in New 
Zealand last February when invaluable information could have been 
obtained. However, instruments of a satisfactory character were 
not in existence, nor are they to-day, except for several types that 
have been developed in Japan which are adapted to frequent, strong 
activity (pi. 8, fig. 2). In this country the Bureau of Standards, 
the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, and the Earthquake Kesearch Laboratory at Pasadena 
are all at work on the development of such instruments, and it is 
expected that satisfactory instruments, even if not of the ultimate 
type, will be available before the end of the present year.

It would be premature to describe instruments which, though in 
process of development, have not yet been tested, but a few funda- 
mental principles may be mentioned. 

It is not necessary to have elaborate piers separated from the floor 
of the building, as for teleseismic instruments, but these strong 
motion instruments may be placed directly on a basement floor or 
preferably on a block of concrete resting on the floor. The principle 
by which early recorders were set in motion by the earthquake, long 
since abandoned because the important earlier and weaker phases 
were lost, is being revived in different form. With a continuously 
turning drum and with photographic recording started by the earth- 
quake the objections are met, with resultant great economy of 
operation. 



THE EARTHQUAKE PEOBLEM HECK 377 

If we know the acceleration, amplitude, and period, other desired 
information can be deduced. The proposed instruments will be 
capable of recording accelerations up to at least 1/5 g and simple 
devices will also be available which will record accelerations up to 
the value of ^, though with no such complete record as for the 
instruments just mentioned. The instruments themselves will have 
to be safeguarded to resist destruction from earthquake. 

Earthquakes are in many cases related to movements of the earth's 
crust which may occur at the time of a severe earthquake or during 
the interval between great earthquakes. The only satisfactory way 
to determine such movements is by precise triangulation and level- 
ing repeated at suitable intervals. Much work of this sort has been 
done in Japan, especially leveling with significant results. In this 
country triangulation was executed in California after the earth- 
quake of 1906 which determined the local movements. During the 
last few years, as the result of a special appropriation by Congress, 
triangulation has been executed in California with connection to 
undisturbed regions to the east, and the plan includes repetition of 
the observations from time to time. A similar situation exists in 
regard to precise levels, though more of this work remains to be 
done. It has been pointed out by geologists that though practically 
all of the movement in the 1868 and 1906 California earthquakes 
was horizontal, geological studies indicate prevailing vertical move- 
ments in the past. 

This work has required high accuracy, and it has been strength- 
ened both by complete adjustment of all the triangulation of the 
western half of the United States and also by the establishment 
of Laplace stations in the region of the special triangulation. These 
are stations where complete astronomical observations are made and 
these are combined with the geodetic observations in such a way as 
to improve the azimuths of lines and consequently the geographical 
positions of points throughout the scheme. While there are a few 
cases of large movements, there seems little doubt that at the Point 
Reyes station there has been horizontal movement of the station 
from its former position of 10^/2 feet, implying a shift of this amount 
of the earth's crust. This is the greatest amount observed any- 
where in California. 

The Japanese have added another type of investigation that they 
have found very useful. Even before the days of instrumental ob- 
servation, as far back as 1793,^ the inhabitants of a coastal village 
noticed a sudden movement of the shore beneath their feet, and as- 
suming that it meant the arrival of a tidal wave they rushed to the 
hills. Nothing occurred for four hours. Then came a great earth-

quake and tidal wave. This phenomenon has been observed to a 
lesser degree in other earthquakes, and the natural assumption is that 
the surface of the earth tilts just before the earthquake. In four 
earthquakes the intervals have varied from one-half to four and 
one-half hours. Recently instrumental observations have been made 
of the tilt of the ground which confirms the earlier observations 
and indicates that in Japan, at least, the tilting of the ground is 
significant. This does not refer to local tilts due to temperature 
which the tilt compensation seismometer eliminates, but it is a long- 
period tilting of the ground in regions subject to severe earthquakes 
with rapid tilting just before the earthquake. If it can be definitely- 
established that this is common to all earthquakes in Japan, even 
when the amount is less than can be readily perceived, it may be 
possible to give an advance notice of a few hours which might be 
invaluable. The Japanese have developed a tiltmeter, and another 
instrument for this purpose has been designed at the United States 
Bureau of Standards, but has not yet been constructed. It is im- 
portant to learn whether this phenomenon is peculiar to Japan or 
any other region where there is block faulting on a large scale or 
whether the same thing will be observed in this country. 

My purpose has been to show that a program of earthquake in- 
vestigation is being developed which, when added to the already 
well organized plan, will fill important gaps in present knowledge. 
Stress has been laid on fundamental principles, instruments, and 
methods, and this serves to emphasize that we are still in a stage 
when these are the all-important things. We are beginning to 
utilize the records to find out facts about the earth, but there is 
great room for expansion in this, field. There are two great fields 
of investigation — that treating the earth as a whole, or dealing with 
a substantial portion of its crust such as the area of the United 
States, and the local investigation as exemplified by the investiga- 
tions in California under the auspices of the Carnegie Institution 
of Washington, the California universities, and other organizations, 
the investigations in the Mississippi Valley under the auspices 
of St. Louis University and the National Research Council, and 
the plan of the Coast and Geodetic Surve}^ for cooperative observa- 
tions chiefly for the benefit of the engineer. 

The studies with regard to the United States as a whole are car- 
ried on by the National Government through the Coast and Geodetic 
Survey with the cooperation of the Weather Bureau, the Geological 
Survey, the Bureau of Standards, and the National Research Council, 
the members of the Jesuit Seismological Association, and the univer- 
sities and colleges in different parts of the country. The eventual 
aim is to keep informed in regard to the elastic condition of the 
earth's crust.

"Coast and Geodetic Survey, who, in addition to his administrative 
relation to the work, has a strong personal interest in the future

development of seismology so as to meet all needs. In a recent 
statement he said : 

I feel that in recent years we have made most gratifying progress in our 
attack upon the problems of seismology in the United States. I can not too 
highly commend the little groups of men by whom that progress has been 
accomplished. They have not only worked untiringly individually, but their 
cooperation with one another has been splendid. 

But I also believe, first, that there is need for increased future effort, and, 
second, that any such increase will necessitate a more formal means of coordi- 
nating the activities of the various participating groups. There will be par- 
ticular need to clarify, and to dovetail together, the respective fields occupied 
by the two general groups consisting, on the one hand, of the geophysicists, 
concerned with the pure science of seismology, and, on the other hand, the 
engineers, architects, and others who are concerned with earthquakes because 
of their potential menace to life and property.

This consists essentially of a heavy mass, known as the steady mass, mounted on an arm which is 
pivoted to a rigiil column in such a manner that the boom will move freely in a vertical plane. The 
free end of the hoom carries a series of coils which move in a strong magnetic field as the boom oscil- 
lates. The terminals of this series of coils are connected to a sensitive galvanometer. As the coil 
moves in the magnetic field, a current of electricity is generated in the circuit which deflects the gal- 
vanometer by an amount depending upon the amplitude <if the motion and the frequency. The 
ground movements, highly magnified, are recorded photographically by reflecting a beam of litrht 
to a photographic recorder described under Plate 2, P'igure 2.

coils and also in parallel with each branch of the circuit. The latter determine the degree of damp- 
ing of seismometer or system. In this instrument the coil of the seismometer moves in a radial mag-

GEOWING PLANTS WITHOUT SOIL 



By Earl S. Johnston 
Division of Radiation and Organisms, Smithsonian Institution 



[With 4 plates] 



Over 300 years ago Johan Baptista van Helmont carried out a very 
simple and interesting experiment at Brussels. The following is 
a record of the experiment as given by Russell : 

I took an eartben vessel in which I put 200 pounds of soil dried in an oven, 
then I moistened with rain water and pressed hard into it a shoot of willow 
weighing 5 pounds. After exactly five years the tree that had grown up 
weighed 169 pounds and about 3 ounces. But the vessel had never received 
anything but rain water or distilled water to moisten the soil when this was 
necessary, and it remained full of soil, which was still tightly packed, and, 
lest any dust from outside should get into the soil, it was covered witli a sheet 
of iron coated with tin but perforated with many holes. I did not take the 
weight of the leaves that fell in the autumn. In the end I dried the soil once 
more and got the same 200 pounds that I started with, less about 2 ounces. 
Therefore the 164 pounds of wood, bark, and root arose from the water alone. 

The experiment is simplicity itself and may be repeated by anyone. 
The language describing it is clear and lacks the many technical 
terms which are common in modern descriptions of experiments. In 
spite of the many good qualities commending this famous old experi- 
ment, Van Helmont's conclusion is illogical and incorrect. As we 
shall note directly, the 164 pounds of wood did not arise from the 
water alone. 

If he had taken the young tree and dried it, thus driving off the 
water, its weight would have been reduced 40 to 50 per cent. If he 
had then burned this dried wood, ash or noncombustible material 
would have remained, though but a small fraction of the final weight 
he recorded. 

Almost half the weight of woody plants can be attributed to the 
water contained in the plant cells and tissues. The other half con- 
sists mainly of organic matter which can be burned, forming carbon 
dioxide, one of the gases in the air. If approximately 50 per cent of 
the plant can be returned to the air as carbon dioxide, it seems reason- 
able to suppose that this gas might have been withdrawn from the air 

381 



382 ANNUAL, EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

by the plant during its growth. Van Helmont had neglected to con- 
sider the air as a very important source of material for plant food. 
Since his day, scientists have discovered that plants absorb carbon 
dioxide from the air, and, by means of the energy of sunlight, unite 
it with water to form sugars and starch. This process is known as 
photosynthesis. From these manufactured substances the plants 
build more complicated food materials which are used in their 
growth and reproduction. 

The ash that remains after the water and combustible materials 
have been driven off by heat should not be overlooked. Although 
the amount of ash is small in comparison to the other materials mak- 
ing up the plant structure, it contains several ver}^ important mineral 
elements that are vital to the growth and vigor of the plant. The 
more commonly known elements are calcium, phosphorus, potassium, 
magnesium, and sulphur. These are some of the elements that form 
the essential ingredients of fertilizers. More than 30 elements have 
been found in the ash of plants. The amounts of some elements such 
as chloride, sodium silicon, and iodine vary greatly in different types 
of plants. Even traces of zinc, tin, lead, silver, and copper have been 
found. Scientists do not at present know if all these elements are 
necessary for the growth of plants, but they are finding that minute 
traces of some elements, such as boron, manganese, and zinc are just 
as essential as those usually mixed to form commercial fertilizers. 

As early as 600 B. C. it was thought that plants obtained all their 
food from water. It is not water alone that the plant takes through 
the roots, but the mineral elements dissolved in it. Even to-day many 
people are surprised to hear that solid particles of fertilizers are not 
absorbed by plant roots. These mineral substances must first be dis- 
solved in the soil water before they can pass into the plant through 
the delicate root membranes. In fact the solid soil may be dispensed 
with and the roots surrounded by liquid onl3\ However simple the 
technique of growing land plants with their roots in water may now 
be, it was not until 1699 that there were any published records of 
such plants grown in water cultures. Woodward grew spearmint, 
potatoes, and vetch in water from a conduit, in river and spring 
water, as well as in rain and distilled water. His purpose was to 
determine whether the water itself or what it contained in the way 
of dissolved matter w^as the nutrient material used by plants. He 
concluded that the water was the carrier of the necessary " terrestrial 
matter." 

The next important step was for man to add artificial terrestrial 
matter to pure or distilled water and thereby determine which ele- 
ments were essential to good plant growth and which were not. Then 
followed a series of experiments by plant investigators to determine 



GROWING PLANTS WITHOUT SOIL. — JOHNSTON 383 

the relative amounts of these essential elements that would give the 
best growth. Years of practical agricultural experience had taught 
man that plants needed nitrates, phosphates, and potash in the soil. 
By many trials they also found that some proportions were better 
than others. Science is now showing by means of water culture 
studies why some of the earlier practices worked out so well. By this 
method man is endeavoring to find out the exact uses made of the 
different elements by plants. 

A natural question which arises is, why should investigators pre- 
fer to grow plants in water containmg dissolved chemicals instead 
of putting the same chemicals in the soil where plants grow nor- 
mally ? A brief discussion of some of the difficulties involved in the 
use of soil will show why water cultures are preferable in experi- 
ments where all the conditions influencing plant growth arc rigidly 
controlled. Physically, the soil is made up of rock particles vary- 
ing in size and shape which are usually mixed with organic material. 
The amount of water that soils hold dejDends on these properties. 
Water easily runs through a loose soil. In a closely packed soil 
water movement is slow. In experiments where several plants are 
to be grown with their roots in exactly similar media, it is at once 
realized how difficult the problem is of potting a number of plants 
in soil so that all of them may be rooted among particles of the 
same size and shape, and similarly packed. When the packing, or 
arrangement of particles, is different, it is found that the capillary 
water films in the soil as well as in the air spaces are altered. All 
these different physical factors would be possible sources of error in 
an otherwise accurately controlled experiment. 

The problem of obtaining two soils that are exactly alike in their 
chemical composition is even more difficult than that of securing two 
that are similar physically. Even a slight difference in the chemi- 
cal composition of two soils may bring about a marked difference in 
plant growth. A single illustration will serve to show the importance 
of this consideration where quantities as small as one part of a certain 
element in 2,000,000 parts of the soil water makes enormous differ- 
ences in plant growth. Boron, a substance found in boric acid and 
borax, and until recently, not seriously considered important in plant 
growth was the element involved in this work. Pure quartz sand 
was used instead of ordinary garden soil as the medium for grow- 
ing a number of potato plants. The sand was watered with a solu- 
tion containing all the elements then considered necessary for growth. 
New glazed earthenware crocks were used to hold the sand. In the 
first two series of experiments the plants grew very well, but in later 
work they became unhealthy and usually showed early death of the 
stem tips. Later when the importance of small traces of boron was 
recognized, the real explanation of the poor growth was obvious. 



384 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

When the crocks were new the plants obtained a sufficient supply of 
boron from the glaze. Later this element was more difficult for the 
plants to obtain as the available supply became exhausted. 

A simple experiment clearly brought out these facts. The same 
crocks were again used, as well as sand from the same source used 
in the earlier experiments. However, a very small amount of boron 
was dissolved in the solution used for watering half the plants. 
This amount was almost inconceivably small, being one part of 
boron to 2,000,000 parts of the solution. The potato plants had 
little difficulty in detecting and using this minute quantity of boron. 
The difference in growth is clearly seen in Plate 1. Imagine to 
what extent a man would be nourished by eating pea soup with one 
pea to each 132 gallons of water. Yet there are minute quantities 
of certain substances just as important to man as boron is to plants. 
Certain glands manufacture traces of interesting chemical com- 
pounds called hormones which stimulate or retard the growth of 
animal tissue. The discovery of iodine in the thyroid was followed 
by the isolation of thyroxine, a stable iodine-containing hormone. 

Too great quantities of certain elements in the soil are just as 
harmful to plants as too small amounts. Slight differences fre- 
quently bring about enormous growth responses. To obtain two or 
more pots of soil that contain exactly the same amounts of all chem- 
ical elements affecting plant growth is a herculean task. Even if 
two such pots of soil were obtained it would be even more difficult 
to determinate accurately the amounts of all the chemicals used by 
the plants. It is hence easy to see that soil cultures are not very 
good media for growing plants in accurately controlled experiments. 
For these reasons and for the simplicity of handling and controlling 
the elements, water cultures are being used more and more where 
exact information of the plant's growth and behavior is desired. 

Water-culture experiments, or those in which plants are grown 
in mineral nutrient solutions made by dissolving pure chemicals in 
distilled water, have furnished science a means of distinguishing the 
useful or essential plant-food elements from the useless or nonessen- 
tial. It is true that chemical analysis demonstrates the presence of 
many elements in plant tissues. It is poor reasoning, however, to 
claim they are all essential. Plants as well as animals take into their 
tissues certain nonessential substances along with the essential. 
The late Prof. Cyrus Hopkins gave to his students a mnemonic sys- 
tem whereby they could easily remember the then supposed essential 
elements for plant growth. It read " C. Hopkins cafe, mighty 
good." When expressed as chemical symbols it appears as follows : 
C. HOPKNS, Ca Fe, Mg, which represent the elements carbon, hy- 
drogen, oxygen, phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen, sulphur, calcium, 



GROWING PLANTS WITHOUT SOIL JOHNSTON 385 

iron, and magnesium. Boron, manganese, and undoubtedly several 
more elements should be added to the list. 

In what forms or chemical compounds can these elements be " fed " 
to the plants? There are numerous combinations of these elements, 
but perhaps the salts most frequently used are calcium nitrate, 
Ca(N03)2; magnesium sulphate, MgS04; monopotassium phosphate, 
KH2PO4 ; potassium nitrate, KNO3 ; ammonium sulphate, (NH4) 0SO4. 
Iron may be supplied in any one of several compounds such as tar- 
trate, citrate, phosphate, or sulphate. A trace of boric acid and 
manganese should be added where all other materials are of the 
highest purity. To be sure, certain plants require larger amounts 
of a given element than others and this same thing is true of a given 
plant at different stages of its development, but in spite of such 
limitations it is rather surprising to find considerable variation in 
the concentrations and proportions of these salts that produce good 
growth. 

Almost every original investigator in the field of plant nutrition 
has devised a particular solution of his own. The result is that 
there are many formulae for making plant-nutrient solutions, each 
of which has some good points. The chief purpose of any of these 
solutions is to give the plant the elements that it needs for its growth 
in a readily soluble form. The ones obtained from the soil in larg- 
est amounts are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and mag- 
nesium. Many different nutrient solutions have been made from 
various combinations of these elements. That proposed by Sachs 
was the first so-called standard solution. Perhaps none has been 
more generally used than the one devised by Knop, which is made 
up of the following salts by weight : Four parts calcium nitrate, one 
part potassium nitrate, one part magnesium sulphate, one part either 
mono or di potassium phosphate, trace of iron. 

Knop's solution was greatly improved by Tottingham for the 
growth of wdieat and then simplified by Shive to a solution com- 
posed of the following volume-molecular proportions of but three 
salts : 

KH2PO4 0. 0180 m 

Ca(N03)= . 0052 m 

MgS04 . 0150 m 

To be sure, iron was needed and was supplied in a very small 
amount, as FeP04. Six of the essential ions— K, Ca, Mg, PO4, NO3, 
and SO4 — used by plants in the greatest amounts were found in 
Shive's simple formula. When very pure salts and distilled Avater 
are used it is necessary to add small amounts (mere traces) of other 
necessary elements. Our more recent knowledge of plant nutrition 



386 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

calls for a more complicated solution than the three-salt one. A 
solution which the writer fonnd to be good for growing tomatoes 
contained the following ions expressed as parts per million parts of 
water used : 

Calcium (Ca) 200 

Magnesium (Mg) 60 

Potassium (K) 78 

Nitrate (NO3) 620 

Sulphate (SO*) 290 

Phosphate (PO4) 74 

Manganese (Mn) 1 

Boron (B) 1 

Iron (Fe) Enough to keep plants green. 

The excellent growth made by the plants in this solution can be 
seen in Plate 2. 

Each ion included in the above list exerts a definite influence on 
the growth of plants. So characteristic is the effect of the omission 
of a. single element that the plant itself frequently serves as an 
index of the element it lacks for normal growth. Again using the 
tomato plant as an example, a healthy leaf and one taken from a 
plant suffering from " potash hunger " are contrasted in Plate 3. 
An insufficient amount of potassium results in a yellowing of the 
older leaves, which later are covered with brown spots. On the 
other hand, phosphorous deficiency brings about a deepening of the 
green color of the leaves, and in severe cases the lower leaf surfaces 
become distinctly purple and the stem grows out slender and sharply 
pointed. With extreme calcium deficiency the growing points of the 
stem soon die and become dry. 

A common method for growing plants in a nutrient solution is, 
first, to germinate the seeds between layers of moist filter or blotting 
paper kept in a glass dish and covered to conserve the moisture. 
When the roots grow to one-fourth to three-fourths of an inch in 
length these seedlings are transferred to a germination net. Two 
pieces of paraffined cotton fly netting are stretched and fastened 
over a suitable dish. It is well to separate the pieces of netting 
from each other by a piece of bent glass tubing one-fourth of an 
inch in diameter. Tlie dish is then filled with water and the roots 
of the seedlings carefully inserted in the meshes of the netting. 
During the subsequent growth of the seedlings tap water is allowed 
to flow through the dish. After the seedlings have reached a height 
of approximately an inch they are transferred to the culture solu- 
tions. Each culture contains one or more seedlings supported by 
means of a little cotton in holes of paraffined flat cork stoppers, 
which fit into the culture jars containing the nutrient solution. The 



GROWING PLANTS WITHOUT SOIL — JOHNSTON 387 

jars used are frequently of the " Mason " type and should be wrapped 
with heavy paper to exclude most of the light from the roots. 
This covering prevents algae from growing in the solution. 

Recently a very interesting series of experiments has been com- 
pleted by Dr. J. E. McMurtrey, of the United States Department of 
Agriculture, on the mineral deficiency symptoms of the tobacco 
plant. The nutrient solutions he used were so devised that one 
element could be omitted without changing the amounts of the other 
elements. The general appearance of these plants, each of which 
suffered from an insufficient amount of an essential element, is shown 
in Plate 4, together with a tobacco plant grown on a complete mineral 
diet. In connection with these experiments, a key has been prepared 
which gives promise of having considerable value in the diagnosis of 
certain malnutritional diseases of the tobacco plant. 

The division of radiation and organisms of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution has initiated certain types of research in which extremely ac- 
curate measurements are being made of several fundamental plant 
activities. In one experiment the absorption of carbon dioxide by 
the plant is being studied under accurately controlled conditions. It 
is highly desirable that the plants be grown in a medium which can 
be better controlled than soil. In other experiments the effect of 
various light intensities and wave lengths on the growth of plants 
is being investigated. Here again soil can not be used because of 
errors it would introduce into the experiment. For the reasons 
pointed out in the foregoing discussion the plants used in these 
accurately controlled experiments are grown in nutrient solutions 
made by adding the proper inorganic chemical compounds to dis- 
tilled water.

SOME ASPECTS OF THE ADAPTATION OF LIVING 
ORGANISMS TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT ^ 



By H. S. Halcbo Wabdlaw 



Our interests as members of this society lead us to consider the 
relation of living things to their environment from many points of 
view. We are on the whole, perhaps, more usually concerned with 
the morphological aspects of this relation, but in this portion of my 
address I wish to direct attention to certain chemical relationships 
which subsist between the living organism and its surroundings. 
After all, the chemical constitution of bodies may be regarded merely 
as a more intimate expression of their morphology, as an expression 
involving smaller units than those which are commonly studied by 
visual examination. And in considering the material relationships 
between a living organism and its environment we can not ignore 
the relationships involving exchanges of energy. The conditions of 
the former are to some extent determined by the requirements of 
the latter. A survey of this kind would involve the discussion of a 
wide range of questions. I wish to refer only to one or two of these 
upon which biochemical information appears to have thrown light, 
and to discuss one or two examples where adaptations have more 
obviously been brought about by chemical adjustments. 

The thesis which I wish to submit to you may be expressed in two 
statements: That the changes which living organisms have under- 
gone in adapting themselves to their environment have had as their 
object the maintenance unchanged of certain essential characters, and 
that the organism which has most successfully adapted itself to its 
surroundings is that which has acquired, to the greatest extent, the 
power of adapting its environment to its needs. 

The most bewildering diversity of forms is met with among living 
things. All these variations of structure may, no doubt, be regarded 
as adaptations of one kind or another to the various environments in 
which the different organisms are to be found. It will be as well, 
therefore, to make clear at the outset what I wish to be understood by

my use of the phrase " adaptation to environment," and then to go 
on to see whether any common factor can be found for the super- 
ficially diverse means by which the living organism seeks to attain 
this adaptation, before discussing any particular examples of adap- 
tive mechanisms. 

By the term environment I mean that portion of its surroundings 
with which an organism can enter into exchanges of matter and 
energy. The limits of the environment may be hard to define and 
will depend upon the particular exchanges which are being con- 
sidered. In the more complex organisms one part may be the envi- 
ronment of the rest. 

I shall use the term " adaptation " as implying broadly any means 
by which an organism is enabled to survive in its surroundings, not 
as an individual but as a species. The term so understood means not 
merely the ability to survive, but the ability to survive without alter- 
ation of certain characters. A moment's reflection will show that, by 
this criterion, we have no convincing evidence that any living organ- 
ism has 3^et proved itself to be completely adapted to its environment. 
On every hand evidence is daily being brought to light of species 
which have become extinct, and yet the members of every living 
species must have descended, in unbroken succession, from individ- 
uals of one or other of those extinct species. Those transient species 
were obviously not completely adapted to their surroundings, but 
there was within the living matter of the individuals which composed 
them, some more effective type of adaptation which has enabled it to 
survive the impermanence of its external form. 

The extinction of so many species has been due, not so much, per- 
haps, to their inability to adapt themselves to their surroundings, 
as to their inability to make their adaptions quickly enough to keep 
pace with their changing environment. For, during the ages which 
have passed since living forms first made their appearance, the nature 
of their environment has, no doubt, altered as profoundly as have 
the living organisms themselves. 

Even the simplest living organism seems to be much more com- 
plex than any inanimate system of which we have detailed knowl- 
edge. But there is no valid reason for supposing that processes other 
than those which are described as physical or chemical play any part 
in their fundamental reactions. We may, therefore, expect the 
behavior of the living organism to show many similarities and 
analogies to that of inanimate systems in their relation to their envi- 
ronment. On the other hand, there are what at present seem to be 
rather characteristic differences between the two types of system, 
although, on close analysis, these distinctions become hard to dr^w. 



ADAPTATION TO ENVTRON-MENT — WARDLAW 391 

A general property of inanimate physical systems is their ten- 
dency to reach a state of equilibrium, that is, they tend to reach a 
state in which exchanges of matter and energy between the various 
parts of the system, and between the system and its surroundings 
are no longer apparent. It is true that it may be possible to demon- 
strate that fluctuations in the state of different parts have not entirely 
ceased in a system which has reached this condition, but these changes 
which still continue do not lead to any gross or permanent redis- 
tribution of matter or energy. 

The same property which makes any physical system tend to reach 
a state of equilibrium, will also resist any agency which tends to 
disturb this state. If an attempt is made to change such a system 
in any way the system will react so that the change produced is not 
as great as it would have been if such a reaction had not taken 
place. For example, if a volume of gas be heated at constant pres- 
sure it will expand, and in expanding it will cool, so that the total 
rise of temperature will not be as great as it would have been had 
the gas not expanded. This system resists the rise of temperature 
due to heating. Again, many substances, when they are dissolved 
in water, cause the temperature of the resulting solution to fall. But 
these substances are less soluble in the colder water, so that less will 
dissolve than would have if the temperature had not fallen. The 
system resists the change of concentration caused by the substance 
going into solution. This behavior is known as the principle of Le 
Chatelier. 

The reaction of a living organism to changes of its environment 
is not, however, limited to that which would take place according 
to the principle of Le Chatelier. In the first place a living organ- 
ism is continually expending energy, and so prevents itself from ever 
attaining a state of equilibrium with its surroundings. Further, it 
is provided with regulatory mechanisms which not merely resist 
changes due to alterations of environment, but which are able to 
neutralize, even to reverse, their effects. To this property of living 
things Cannon (1929) has applied the term " homeostasis." 

Some of these regulating mechanisms are remarkably efficient. 
Their object is to maintain unchanged any system of which they 
are a part. But no such mechanism, however perfect it may be, can 
render an organism completely independent of external changes. 
Some response to these changes, however small that response may be, 
is necessary to set the adjusting mechanism in action, and this 
mechanism, once set in motion, will not cease to act until the condi- 
tion aimed at is overshot, no matter how slightly. Such an effect 
is common to all governing mechanisms. All that they can do is to 
insure that the variations imjjosed upon the organism by a changing 



392 ANNUAL KEPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

environment shall be restricted within certain limits. The more 
effective the mechanism is, the closer together will these limits be. 

Broadly speaking, we may say that the living organism first pro- 
tects itself against the variations of its surroundings by placing 
barriers between itself and its environment. The process of encyst- 
ment and the formation of spores are what appear to be simple 
examples of this type of reaction which are shown by very simple 
organisms. Even more highly developed organisms make use of 
devices of this kind at some stage of their life histories, as in the 
formation of seeds by plants. 

There is no doubt about the effectiveness of such a mechanism for 
protecting an organism against unfavorable changes of its environ- 
ment. The extreme difficulty with which the spores of certain 
microorganisms are destroyed, even by the most drastic treatment, 
is well known. The tenacity with which the seeds of certain plants 
retain their viability has been demonstrated by Cambage (1928), 
who showed that seeds of Acacia melanoxylon were capable of ger- 
mination after 10 years' soaking in sea water. In its simplest form, 
however, a protective mechanism of this kind imposes severe restric- 
tions upon the organism using it. At times such an organism must 
purchase its survival by an almost complete suspension of its vital 
activities. The mechanism can do no more than protect the organ- 
ism from destruction b}^ extremes of variation in its environment, 
and appears to display the phenomenon of adaptation in its crudest 
form. It is a regulatory mechanism which permits of wide varia- 
tion in the rate at which the organism is able to carry on its activities. 
Except for this power of passive resistance, an organism limited to 
this kind of adaptive mechanism is still very largely at the mercy 
of its environment. 

Another way in which an organism may place a barrier between 
itself and certain parts of its surroundings is by removing itself from 
those parts. It is able to do this wdien possessed of the property of 
motility which is shown even by some of the most primitive forms of 
life. As an adaptive mechanism, motility in many ways is a distinct 
advance beyond processes similar to encystment. The motile organ- 
ism is able to make use of one part of its environment to protect itself 
against another. Instead of erecting about itself, when conditions 
become unfavorable, barriers composed of its own substance, it is 
able to place parts of its environment between itself and those 
conditions. 

It is evident that the freedom of an organism possessing motility 
must be much greater than that of similar organisms without this 
mechanism. Its effect is to render unnecessary many of the varia- 
tions of activity to which the nonmotile organism must be subject. 



ADAPTATION TO ENVrROlSrMENT WARDLAW 393 

by avoiding many of the occasions on which those variations would 
occur. It is an adaptive mechanism which avoids many adaptive 
modifications on the part of the organism. In addition it is capable 
of being much more selective in action than a mechanism which 
withdraws the organism from a condition of interchange with its 
environment. The working of this mechanism is seen most clearly 
perhaps in the tropisms which many of the more primitive living 
forms display. The movements of the more complex organisms do 
not always bear such an evident relation to the effects of environment 
as do those of the simpler. They are complicated as a rule by the 
simultaneous action of many other adaptive mechanisms. The large- 
scale movements, however, even of the higher animals, such as migra- 
tions, are sufficiently analogous to tropisms to suggest that they may 
be the results of some common underlying mechanism. 

An organism possessed of the property of motility is considerably 
more independent of its surroundings than an organism limited to the 
type of adaptive mechanism first discussed, but its chances of survival 
are not necessarily greater. While it does survive, however, its vital 
activities are likely to be much less subject to variation than those of 
an organism whose only protection is quiescence. 

Although this mechanism shows a great advance over that previ- 
ously discussed, its effectiveness is still decidedly limited. It is, no 
doubt, adequate for those simple organisms whose normal environ- 
ment is not subject to much simultaneous variation in several com- 
ponents. Such a mechanism is likely to break down, if not assisted by 
other regulatory devices, when the organism is faced with concurrent 
changes of different factors of its environment. Removal of the 
organism from a portion of its environment unfavorable in one re- 
spect may deprive it of conditions which may be favorable in other 
respects. An organism restricted to this type of adaptive mechanism, 
or even possessing it in addition to the power of becoming encysted, 
would often find itself in a dilemma. 

PRIMITIVE RELATIONS BETWEEN ORGANISM AND ENVIRONMENT 

The action of all of the mechanisms which regulate the chemical 
relations of the organism is essentially to control the exchange of 
material which takes place between the organism and its surround- 
ings. In its crudest form this mechanism acts simply by abolishing 
interchange between organism and environment when the characters 
of the latter become unsuitable. As these mechanisms develop in 
effectiveness, and, incidentally, in complexity, so do they increase in 
selectivity. They become able to control independently the exchange 
of a wide variety of substances with the outside world, and so to regu- 
late the concentrations of these substances in contact with the living 



394 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

matter that the organism may carry on its activities with a minimum 
of adventitious disturbance. 

The fact that the living organisms of to-day have evolved from 
more primitive forms seems to involve the assumption that the mecha- 
nisms which have enabled living matter to survive have done so be- 
cause of their ability to preserve at least some of its primitive charac- 
ters. It will be interesting, therefore, to cite evidence which has been 
adduced in support of the hypothesis that living organisms tend to 
retain some of the properties which they may have possessed at very 
early stages of their evolution, no matter how complex they have 
eventually become. 

Conjectures as to the series of reactions which may have led to the 
appearance of organic matter out of which the first living organisms 
were formed need not concern us. We are more concerned at the 
moment with the conditions of environment which may have existed 
when living forms were in the early stages of their evolution. It may 
be mentioned, however, that investigations such as those of Moore 
(1914) and of Baly (1927) and their coworkers have indicated the 
possibility of the synthesis of naturally occurring organic compounds 
from water, carbon dioxide, and inorganic salts under the influence 
of radiant energy and in the presence of inorganic catalysts. 

No matter what the conditions may have been under which living 
matter first arose, they were obviously favorable to its appearance. 
Conversely, since the first living organism may be assumed to have 
been a direct product of its environment, there can be no doubt 
but that it was eminently well adapted to its surroundings. In the 
meantime, the conditions surrounding the living organism have un- 
dergone tremendous changes. As far as we know, none of the living 
organisms of the present day can be regarded as direct products of 
their environment. 

When the composition of one of the higher forms of animal life 
is compared with that of its surroundings, the differences which are 
observed are much more obvious than the resemblances. Out of some 
80 elements around it, the organism chooses 4 from which to build 
up about 95 parts out of every 100 of its substance. When, however, 
certain parts of an organism are compared with certain kinds of 
environment, a much closer correspondence can sometimes be seen, 
and there are indications that more intimate relations may once have 
prevailed between the two than can now be shown. 

There must have been something fundamentally essential in the 
conditions under which life began. The enormous development of 
complexity which has taken place in some of the living organisms 
of the present day can be traced largely to the series of modifications 
which seems to have had for their object, the maintenance, in the 



ADAPTATION TO ENVIRONMENT WAKDLAW 395 

immediate vicinity of living matter, of conditions resembling those 
of its primitive state. From this point of view the whole story of 
evolution is one of adaptation to environment. It is a history of 
the mechanisms developed, of the subterfuges resorted to, of the 
changes undergone by living matter to maintain essential characters 
unchanged in a changing world. 

There seems to be a general agreement among biologists that liv- 
ing forms originated in the sea. The chemical examination of 
organisms supports this view. All the reactions of living matter 
take place in aqueous solution. The ultimate units of structure, the 
cells, even of the most highly developed land forms, still live in a 
medium which bears certain striking resemblances to sea water. 

We have no direct means of knowing w^iat was the composition 
of the aqueous medium in which living matter first made its ap- 
pearance. It must, however, have been a dilute salt solution, but 
of a composition differing materially from the sea w^ater of the 
present time with respect both to the concentrations of and the pro- 
portions between the various ions present. The water which first 
condensed on the cooling surface of the earth would, in its course 
downw^ards to the lower levels, begin to leach out the soluble mate- 
rials with which it came into contact. The more soluble materials 
w'ould dissolve more readily than the less soluble. As this leaching 
action continued, the available supplies of the more soluble mate- 
rials would diminish more rapidly than the available supplies of the 
less soluble substances. It may be assumed, then, that the earlier 
river waters, and the seas which they fed, were relatively richer in 
these more soluble materials than the waters of later periods. 

During the period of their evolution in the w^aters of the seas, liv- 
ing organisms have thus been exposed to a medium of continuously, 
if slowly, altering composition. Does the study of the chemical 
composition of the living organism of the present afford any evi- 
dence that it has passed through these conditions? The individuals 
of the more highly evolved species during their ontogeny pass 
through a series of modifications of structure which summarize, as 
it were, the stages through which the present form of the species has 
been reached during the course of evolution. Macallum (1926) has 
shown that there is reason to believe that just as the complex organ- 
ism acquired certain structures at definite stages of its evolution, so 
it has perpetuated certain of its chemical properties from remote 
phases of the history of its forerunners. 

CHEMICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS 

At present the ontogeny of the chemical characters of organisms 
is not known with anything like the detail wdiich is available with 



396 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

regard to their morphological development. A similar state of 
affairs exists with regard to our knowledge of the chemical phy- 
logeny of living forms. The paleontologist has access in the sedi- 
mentary rocks to records of extinct species from which he can recon- 
struct at least some of their morphology. But as a rule the chemical 
characters of extinct organisms do not leave any direct record in 
the rocks. The information which we have as to the composition 
of extinct organisms is largely based on analogies drawn from our 
knowledge of the composition of existing structures homologous with 
those observed in fossil remains, or from the persistence of structures 
which were mainly composed of inorganic material. 

Fortunately this rule is not entirely without exceptions. In one 
or two rare instances there is reason to believe that organic com- 
pounds present in long extinct organisms have been preserved from 
the remote past. It is a matter of pride to us to know that the 
latest of these rare discoveries has been made by a distinguished 
member of this society, our esteemed past president, Sir Edgeworth 
David. In the course of the examinations made in connection with 
his discovery of structures of living origin in pre-Cambrian strata, 
David (1928) observed that some of these structures consist of or- 
ganic matter which is apparently the original chitin of which the 
skeletons of these animals (annelids) were largely composed. 

Direct glimpses like this into what has been termed the paleochem- 
istry of living things are of great importance. They give direct 
support to the otherwise very indirect evidence upon which is based 
our belief in the stability of some of the chemical characters of 
living organisms. 

The paucity of our knowledge of the detailed composition of living 
things does not permit us to classify them in such small subdivi- 
sions as are made possible by our more detailed knowledge of their 
morphology. In this connection, however, the pioneering work of 
Smith and Baker (1920) must receive due mention. These in- 
vestigators in their now classical researches followed out the relation 
between certain of the chemical constituents and the structure of a 
group of Australian plants. 

Investigations of this kind, however, relate rather to the associa- 
tion which is to be found between highly specialized structures and 
compounds in living things. They bring out the changes which 
have taken place during the evolution of the chemical characters 
of living things rather than emphasize the relative permanence of 
some of the more primitive of these characters. 

When we wish to consider the more fundamental chemical char- 
acters of the living organism, we must examine the less highly spe- 
cialized tissues, and the wider divisions of morphological differentia- 



ADAPTATION TO ENVIEONMENT WAKDLAW 397 

tion. We must study the distribution of relatively simple inorganic 
compounds, rather than that of the highly complex organic sub- 
stances. Only when comparisons are made on the basis of such 
broad distinctions of form as that between organisms having a 
closed circulatory system and those without it are correspondingly 
fundamental dill'erences of chemical properties to be discerned. 

THE PROPORTIONS OF CERTAIN CONSTITUENTS OF THE ORGANISM 
AND ITS ENVIRONMENT 

There is no doubt that the unicellular organisms represent an 
earlier stage in the evolution of living things than do the metazoan 
or metaphytan forms. They probabl}^ flourished in the primordial 
oceans for long periods before multicellular organisms made their 
appearance. They must have been much more closely related to 
the medium from which they had been produced than the later 
forms. In particular, their inorganic constituents are likely to have 
corresponded fairly closely with those of the medium which bathed 
their cells. The differentiation between the medium and its product 
had not proceeded as far as it has reached in more complex forms 
of life. 

It has been pointed out, however, that the inorganic composition 
of these primitive oceans must have been changing all the time. 
The effect of regulatory mechanisms in the cell would be to hinder, 
if not entirely to prevent, the changes from reaching the interior 
of the cell itself. By the time that living organisms had reached 
the state of complexity of the primitive multicellular structure, 
we may imagine them as groups of cells permeated by a solution 
which showed distinct differences in inorganic composition from 
that of the solution which bathed them. At first the surrounding 
medium would have free access to the cells of such a simple organ- 
ism. But, as the complexity of the organism developed, access 
would become restricted to certain channels forming a primitive, 
open, circulatory system. The next stage in complexity would be 
the closure of these channels against the free ingress and egress of 
the surrounding medium, and the development of a closed circulatory 
system. 

At this stage of evolution, the first barrier controlling the ex- 
changes which take place between the cell and its environment 
would no longer be situated on the surface of the cell itself. Any 
changes which reached the liquid actually surrounding the cells 
would first be subject to the regulatory mechanisms in the outer 
surface of the organism and in the circulating fluid. The cell 
would be provided with an immediate environment to some extent 
under the control of the organism itself. 



398 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONL\N INSTITUTION, 19 31 

During all the period necessary for these developments, the change 
of composition of the surrounding medium would be still in prog- 
ress. But once the action of a closed circulatory system became 
elective, the changes in composition of the medium bathing the 
cells would not proceed so rapidly. Although the composition of 
the external medium might continue to change, the changes would 
only reach the circulating fluid, the internal environment of the 
cells, in a modified form. The organism would tend to preserve the 
composition of the fluid with which it had been bathed while a 
closed circulatory system was being evolved. 

Such an organism would be capable of very considerable inde- 
pendence of its external medium, an independence which would 
increase as its external regulatory mechanisms grew in perfection. 
Not until living organisms had reached this stage of complexity 
would they become able to emerge from the medium in which they 
had evolved, and their appearance as land forms of multicellular 
organisms become possible. 

It is well known that the inorganic composition of the cells of 
various tissues of an organism differs materially from the inorganic 
composition of the circulatory fluid. According to the hypothesis 
outlined above, the inorganic constituents of the cells ought to cor- 
respond to those of sea water at an early stage in the evolution of 
living things. The composition of the circulating fluid ought, on 
the other hand, to correspond, with regard to its inorganic constitu- 
ents, to the composition of sea water of a much later period. 

Macallum (1926) has collected a good deal of evidence in de- 
veloping this hypothesis. The most striking difference between the 
inorganic constituents present in the cells and those in the circulating 
fluids of one of the higher animals is the relative abundance of salts 
of potassium in the former and of salts of sodium in the latter. 
There is a remarkably close correspondence between the proportions 
of these two elements in the circulating fluid of the most highly 
organized living forms which have so far been developed and in the 
sea water of the present day. If the comparison could be made 
with the composition of the sea water during the period in which 
the vertebrates first appeared, the correspondence would perhaps 
be still closer, owing to the slightly greater pro^Dortion of potassium 
in the sea water of that period. 

The difficulties in the way of forming an accurate estimate of the 
composition of sea water during the comj^aratively recent geological 
epoch in which vertebrates appeared are great enough. Much greater 
are the difficulties in the way of an attempt to form a similar 
estimate of the composition of the sea water of the remote age dur- 
ing which unicellular organisms were evolving. Even though no 



ADAPTATION TO EN"VrRON"MENT — WAEDLAW 399 

attempt has been made to fix the proportion within narrow limits, 
it seems likely that the proportion of potassium to sodium must 
have been many times as great as it is at present. With respect 
to these elements, the composition of those primeval seas must have 
been considerably closer to that of the cell contents of the present 
day than to that of the circulating fluid. 

Even when such diverse cellular tissues as human muscles and 
herring ova are examined, the difference between the relative pro- 
portions of sodium and potassium is not very marked. A general 
similarity of the proportions of these elements in cellular tissues 
is apparent. These considerations have been used to support the 
hypothesis that the living organism has retained with remarkable 
tenacity certain of the chemical characters imposed upon it at re- 
mote periods of its evolution. 

THE CONCENTRATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT OF CELLS 

So far only the proportions between certain elements in living 
tissue have been considered. It may now be asked whether the actual 
concentrations of chemical substances present also show any relation 
to those of the medium within which living organisms evolved 
during a considerable period of their history. 

The most convenient single measure of the total concentration of 
materials dissolved in a liquid is the osmotic pressure. The data 
which have been collected by Botazzi (1908) show that osmotic 
pressures of the body fluids of the most highly developed groups of 
terrestrial living forms, vary only between remarkably narrow 
limits. When different forms of sea life are examined, however, 
a very different state of affairs is found. Even if the examination 
be restricted to vertebrate forms, wide ranges of osmotic pressure 
of the body fluids are met with. In the elasmobranchs, for example, 
the osmotic pressure of the body fluids is practically that of the sea 
water in which they live. In the teleosts, on the other hand, the 
osmotic pressure of the body fluids differs widely from that of the 
sea water and approaches the value found for mammalian fluids. 

Dakin (1908) has shown that the differences observable among 
different species of fish are due to the fact that they possess adjusting 
mechanisms of different degrees of efficiency and not to the mainte- 
nance of specifically distinct levels of osmotic pressure. Specimens of 
plaice taken in a brackish portion of the North Sea gave values for the 
osmotic pressure of their blood 20 per cent lower than that of speci- 
mens taken where the osmotic pressure of the sea water was about 
74 per cent higher. The osmotic pressure of the blood of cod, on 
the other hand, showed a variation of only about 3 per cent, while 



400 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

the variations of osmotic pressure in the localities from which they 
were taken covered as wide a range as 64 per cent. 

The same data which have been used to show that the proportions 
between some of the elements in the bodies of living organisms are 
perpetuations of the proportions to which these organisms were 
exposed at certain stages of their development, have been used to 
show that the osmotic pressure of the body fluids of the higher 
animals may also be a perpetuation of the conditions of an early 
stage of their development. The sea water at the time when these 
animals were developing closed circulations must have been much 
more dilute than it is to-day; its osmotic pressure has been assessed 
at a value only about one-third of what it is at present. Such a 
value would be very close to the osmotic pressure of the body fluids 
of the higher animals. 

EXCHANGE OF MATERIAL BETWEEN ORGANISM AND ENVIRONMENT 

The mechanism for the control of the proportions between certain 
of the constituents of the living organism must be of considerably 
more ancient origin than the mechanism for the control of the total 
concentrations of these constituents. Even the simplest unicellular 
organisms must be possessed to some extent of the former mechanism. 
The means for controlling the concentration of materials, as ex- 
pressed by their osmotic pressure, has, on the other hand, only been 
developed in the most complex metazoa. 

It has already been indicated that the action of the former mech- 
anism is a result of the control which the barriers between the cell 
and its environment are able to exert over the passage of materials 
into and out of the interior of the cell. It will also be dependent 
to some extent upon what may for the moment be termed the 
" affinity " of the cell contents for certain of these materials. 

Very little is yet known about the conditions governing the passage 
of different substances across the cell membrane into the body of the 
cell. The properties of the surface presented by the cells to their 
immediate environment must be the most important factors in the 
process. These properties are determined largely by the degree of 
dispersion of protein and phospholipide colloids of which the cell 
membrane largely consists. The proportions of the ions adsorbed 
to these colloids exercise an important influence on their condition. 
In particular, they affect the distribution of the dispersant medium 
(water) between their sol and gel phases, and so can vary the area 
of the portion of the surface through which water soluble substances 
would be able to pass. 

The importance of maintaining the correct balance between the 
proportions of the ions in contact with living tissue was fully 



ADAPTATION TO ENVIRONMENT WARDLAW 401 

recognized by Kinger (1884). In his classical series of papers he 
investigated in some detail the effect of variations of these propor- 
tions on the properties of living matter. These investigations have 
been the starting point of much of the later work. Hamburgher 
(1921), who made use of a rather highly specialized type of cell 
for his experiments, was the first to study directly this effect on the 
permeability of the cell wall. He was able to demonstrate clearly 
that variations of the proportions of the ions in the fluid to 
which these cells were exposed were able markedly to alter their 
permeability towards different materials. 

Comparative studies have not so far been made to show how the 
power of the organism to regulate the relative proportions of the 
different elements, or more particularly ions, in its substance has 
developed during the course of evolution. A great deal of attention 
has been paid within recent years to the study of the proportions be- 
tween the hydrogen and hj^droxyl ions which are derived from the 
medium in which all the vital reactions take place. It seems, how- 
ever, that the power of regulating the proportion between these ions 
must be of later development than the ability to preserve certain 
ratios between various other ions. Among the lower organisms con- 
siderable variation of the concentration of hydrogen ions may be sur- 
vived by some forms. In the highest forms of life, however, the con- 
centration of those ions is kept extraordinarily constant. It is al- 
lowed to vary between narrower limits even than the osmotic pres- 
sure. The proportions between certain inorganic substances in solu- 
tions, such as those in the neighborhood of and within living cells, 
determine what shall be the proportions between the ions of the sol- 
vent water. Indeed, even in the higher organisms, the occurrence of 
rapid variations in the proportions of these ions is prevented by the 
concentrations of certain other substances which are present. These 
are known as buffer substances. Among the inorganic salts which 
exercise this controlling action the more important are the sodium 
salts of carbonic and phosphoric acids. 

The control of the permeability of the living cells must thus largely 
depend on the composition of the medium with which they are in con- 
tact, and on the presence of certain substances in the cells themselves. 

The mechanism controlling the total concentration or osmotic pres- 
sure of the medium bathing the cells of an organism, on the other 
hand, must also be actuated by the composition of this medium, but 
in a manner different from that by which it influences the permea- 
bility of the tissues. It is true that the exchange of material between 
an organism with a closed circulatory system and its environment is 
limited to certain areas of its surface, for example, to the areas 
covered by the epithelium of the alimentary and respiratory tracts. 



402 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

By these epithelia some selective action is, no doubt, exercised over 
the materials entering the organism. Their situation alone is such as 
to prevent access to them of any but selected parts of the environ- 
ment. But as a characteristic feature of organisms possessing this 
mechanism is the freedom rather than the restriction of its exchanges 
with the outside world, the main regulatory mechanism must be 
sought elsewhere. 

All organisms which have the power of regulating the osmotic 
pressure of their body fluids are provided with an excretory organ 
corresponding to a kidney. This mechanism exercises its control over 
the composition of the circulating fluid by eliminating from the 
organisms those constituents passing through it which are present 
in excess. It contributes to the independence of the organism of its 
environment, or, in other words, to its adaptation thereto, by placing 
another means at its disposal for keeping within suitable limits the 
immediate environment of its cells. 

Even in those vetebrates in which the osmotic pressure of the body 
fluids is close to that of the surrounding medium there is a con- 
siderable degree of control exercised over the proportions of the 
various materials present. While the proportions between the vari- 
ous ions may be close to that of the sea water, their total concen- 
tration may be only a fraction of this. The remainder of the osmotic 
pressure in these cases is contributed by excretory products, prin- 
cipally urea, which are allowed to reach relatively high concentra- 
tions. This fact has been taken as evidence that the primary func- 
tion of the kidney is not to excrete end-products of metabolism, but 
to adjust the composition of the immediate environment of the cells. 

The possession of such a mechanism enables the organism to un- 
dertake more active measures to adapt itself to its environment and 
in some degree to adapt its environment to its needs. The environ- 
ment of such an organism has already been modified before it gains 
access to any but specialized portions of the living substance. While, 
then, the cells of the organism are enabled to continue their existence 
under more or less primitive conditions, the organism as a whole is 
able to carry on its activities but little affected by the vicissitudes 
of a changing environment. 

CONTROL OF ENVIRONMENT BY ORGANISM 

(A) FOOD SUPPLY 

In discussing the means taken by certain primitive organisms to 
adapt themselves to their surroundings, reference was made to the 
process of encystment and the performance of tropic movements. It 
was pointed out that in protecting the organism against unfavorable 



ADAPTATION TO ENVmONMENT WARDLAW 403 

conditions, these two classes of mechanism had at least ono feature 
in common. They owe their effectiveness to the fact that barriers 
are placed between the organism and unfavorable conditions. In 
the first instance cited, the barrier is composed of the substance of 
the organism. The surface of contact between the organism and 
its environment is rather sharply defined. In the second instance, 
the barrier is composed of a part of the environment, which the 
organism places between itself and the unfavorable conditions. 
The change which takes place is not in the organism, but in the 
distribution of its enWronment about it. In neither instance, how- 
ever, does the environment itself undergo any perceptible modifica- 
tion, nor does the organism itself appear to undergo further change. 

As our definition of the term adaptation is the power to remain 
essentiall}^ unchanged in spite of external changes, it might be sup- 
posed that, as adaptive mechanisms increased in efficiency, they would 
bring about an ever sharper differentiation between the organism 
and its environment. An examination of the relevant data shows 
that what actually happens is just the reverse of this. Far from 
tending to isolate themselves more completely from their surround- 
ings, the most perfectly adapted organisms are those in which the 
freest interchange is allowed with the environment. 

Although the effect of each increase in the complexity of the 
mechanism of adaptation is to place additional barriers between the 
essential living unit, at the same time it extends further the range 
over which the organism is able to modify or, as it were, overlap its 
environment. Each adaptation, by increasing the intimacy of the 
relations between the organism as a whole and its external surround- 
ings, protects the cell itself still more effectively from variations in 
the medium in which it lives. 

One of the most important factors in the environment of an organ- 
ism is the supply of available food materials which it contains. The 
ability favorabl}^ to control this supply nnjst therefore be of great 
assistance to an organism to maintain itself in that uniform state 
which we have conceived as one of the principal aims of adaptive 
processes. This ability is possessed by man in an outstanding degree, 
but many organisms possess this power to a greater or less extent. 
It is seen more especially in the provision which they nuikc for the 
nutrition of their young. 

In oviparous animals and in many plants the young organism, 
when it leaves the body of its parent, is enclosed in a more or less 
impervious membrane which contains a supply of food material. By 
this means the young organism is able to pass through certain stages 
of its development in an environment which is entirely independent 
of outside fluctuations of food supply. In organisms of this kind, 
102992—32 27 



404 AiSTNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

direct association between the parent and its offspring ceases at a 
comparatively early stage of the development of the latter. This 
does not mean that the parent ceases to have any influence over the 
environment of its offspring as soon as the direct association between 
the two ceases. One need only refer to the elaborate precautions 
taken by birds to preserve a suitable environment about their young 
after hatching. 

The direct association between parent and offspring persists in 
viviparous animals until a much later stage in the development of 
the latter. In these organisms, as in the former class, the environ- 
ment of the young during the period of gestation is furnished by the 
circulating fluid of the body of its parent. The variations of this 
fluid are kept within certain limits by the regulatory mechanisms 
of the parent. The young organism is thus provided with a medium 
of constant properties while its own regulatory mechanisms are de- 
veloping. In some viviparous animals the association between par- 
ent and offspring ceases almost completely at birth, and the young 
organism, having been provided with its own adjusting mecha- 
nisms, as efficient as those of its parent, is left to adapt itself to its 
new surroundings. 

Like most of their adaptive mechanisms, the devices of mammals 
for the care of their young are more complex and effective than those 
of other forms of life. In addition to the protective measures to 
which allusion has been made, the mammals provide for their off- 
spring a special food, milk, during part of their extra-uterine life. 
The period for which this provision is made varies widely among 
different species. In man it extends, under natural conditions, over 
the greater part of a year, in some races much longer. 

This mechanism for the adaptation of one factor of the environ- 
ment to the needs of the organism, represents one of the last stages 
in adaptation by modifications of bodily structure and function. It 
is interesting to observe how closely, in this latest adaptive mecha- 
nism, certain properties of the environment are adjusted to the needs 
of the organism. 

It should be remarked at the outset, however, that one of the most 
striking properties of milk has probably no significance in relation 
to its use as a food by the young organism. This is the fact that the 
osmotic pressure of milk has a value very close to that of the body 
fluids of the animal by which it is consumed. Milk probably owes 
this property to the manner of its secretion from the body fluids 
of the maternal organism. Before the milk is absorbed by the young 
animal, certain of its constituents must undergo a process of diges- 
tion or hydrolysis. The sum of the osmotic pressures of the prod- 
ucts of digestion is considerably greater than that of the original 



ADAPTATION TO ENVIRGNMENT WAEDLAW 405 

milk, SO that the osmotic pressure of the solution actually absorbed 
differs materially from that of the body fluids of the young animal. 

When the composition of milk is examined, it is found that 
although the proportions of the various constituents show consider- 
able variations among different animals, and even among individuals 
of the same species (Wardlaw, 1915, 1917, 1926), the same con- 
stituents are present in each. The concentration of each constituent 
appears to be adapted to the needs of each species. It will be remem- 
bered that in considering the relation of the most primitive living 
organisms to their environment, some of the evidence was mentioned 
which seemed to point to a close relation between the proportions 
of certain elements of inorganic compounds present in the surround- 
ing medium, and the proportions of these elements in the body of the 
organism itself. 

A comparison between the proportions of the various elements in 
the inorganic, or more strictly speaking, the incombustible portions 
of milk and the proportions of the same elements in the bodies of 
the young organisms which consume the milk, also shows a remark- 
able correspondence. These proportions are not those of the circu- 
lating fluids of the animals. An explanation of this correspondence 
is not to be sought, therefore, like that between the osmotic pressure 
of milk and body fluids, in an incidental transference of certain 
properties from the circulating fluid of the maternal organism to 
its offspring. The correspondence seems to be due to a definite 
adaptation of this part of the environment to the needs of the young 
animal. 

A similar correspondence between those organic constituents of the 
milk, which are used as building materials, and the composition of 
the young organism has not been found. This is partly, no doubt, 
because it would be a matter of very great difficulty to estimate 
separately the various units into which the proteins of milk are 
broken up in the course of digestion. But may it not be due, in part, 
to that more primitive and intimate relation between the inorganic 
constituents of a living organism and its nutrient medium to Avhich 
the evidence discussed earlier seems to point? The most primitive 
living things must have had practically no relation to organic com- 
pounds in their inorganic environment. The oi'ganic compounds of 
their own cells they synthesized themselves. The relation between 
the organic constituents of the organism and those of its environment 
can only have become of importance at a much later stage in the 
development of living things, and is likely to be less intimate than 
that with the inorganic constituents. If this be so, it gives further 
support to the supposition that certain of the fundamental properties 
of living matter of to-day are perpetuations of conditions which 
existed when life was at its beginning. 



406 ANNUAL REPOT?T SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

It must not be thought, however, that numerous adaptations of 
the organic portions of milk to the needs of the young animal can 
not be shown. The organic constituents of milk may be divided into 
those which can only be used as fuel and those which furnish material 
for the construction of the body of the young animal. If we compare 
the milks of animals whose young grow at different rates, for ex- 
ample, we find that there is a definite relation between the concentra- 
tion of the organic building materials and the rate of growth, the 
concentrations being greater in the milk of the more rapidly growing 
animals. A similar relation, incidentally, is to be seen between the 
rate of growth and the total concentration of the inorganic con- 
stituents. 

Even the constituents of the milk, which serve only as fuels, al- 
though they play no part in the contribution of material for build- 
ing up the body of the young animal, show adaptations to the vari- 
ous needs, not merely of different species, but even of different indi- 
viduals. 

The young of warm-blooded animals living in cold climates are, for 
example, exposed to greater losses of heat than those of animals liv- 
ing in warmer regions. We find a correspondingly higher concen- 
tration of the fuel, fat, in the milk of the animals indigenous to cold 
regions. Again, other things being equal, small animals tend to 
consume relatively greater quantities of energy per day than larger 
animals. The milk of small animals is, in general, richer in fat 
than the milk of larger animals. This relation can not only be 
seen among different species of mammals varying widely in size, 
but even in individuals of the same species. The small Jersey cow, 
for example, yields a milk richer in fat than larger breeds. 

The range of variation of size among human individuals is much 
smaller. The correspondences between the composition of the milk 
and the needs of the human infant are, therefore, much less obvious. 
They require a closer scrutiny for their discovery. But it may be 
shown, by suitable methods, that there is a definite correlation be- 
tween relatively slight variations of the physical characters of 
healthy infants and the composition of the milk with which they 
are supplied by their mothers (unpublished observations). This is 
surely a striking example of the length to which the adaptation of 
the immediate environment to the needs of the organism is carried 
by the most highly organized of all animals. 

(B) EXCHANGES OF ENERGY 

None of the devices to which the living organism resorts for the 
control of the composition of its immediate environment can exert 
its full effectiveness if the temperature of this environment is 



ADAPTATION- TO ENVn^ONMENT WAEDLAW 407 

allowed to vary unrestricted. Still less, under these circumstances, 
can the organisni attain that freedom from external variation of 
the rate of its activities which seems to be one of the principal objects 
of adaptive mechanisms. The rates of chemical reactions vary 
rapidly with the temperature at which they take \Aace. The effect of 
these variations upon the activities of organisms without a tempera- 
ture-regulating mechanism is so striking and so familiar as to require 
no further reference. 

The effect of variation of temperature on the composition of living 
tissues and of their immediate environment is not so obvious, but is 
none the less important. Variations of temperature alter the equi- 
librium constants of chemical reactions. In this way they alter the 
proportions between the reacting materials which will exist under 
given conditions. For example, the proportions between the ions in 
the circulating fluids and cells will not be the same at different tem- 
peratures. We have seen the permeability of the living cell is largely 
controlled by the proportions of the ions present in its immediate 
vicinity. As it is this permeability which determines many of 
the fundamental properties of living matter, these properties must be 
modified by changes of temperature, quite apart from any changes 
in the rate of the vital activities which they may bring about. 

The temperature-regulating mechanisms of all the warm-blooded 
animals are by no means equally effective. In the higher mammals 
this mechanism continues to function as long as the external condi- 
tions of temperature remain within limits compatible with the life 
of the animal. In other species, however, the mechanism goes out 
of action if the temperature of the surroundings falls below certain 
levels which the animal can still survive. At these lower tempera- 
tures the animals behave like cold-blooded animals and have body 
temperatures close to those of their external environment. This is 
the phenomenon of hibernation. The ease with which this mecha- 
nism is thrown out of action by a fall of temperature differs among 
different species. It is interesting to observe that in Echidna^ which, 
on morphological grounds, is regarded as the most primitive of 
mammals, the action of the heat-regulating mechanism is peculiarly 
susceptible to disturbance. It ceases to function at external temper- 
atures several degrees higher than those at which an effect is to be 
seen in other hibernating animals. (Wardlaw, 1915, 1921.) 

It is well known also that the effectiveness of the mechanism for 
the regulation of body temperature of warm-blooded animals is much 
less eflicient in the immature individuals than in the adults. Even 
in normal infants, for example, the fluctuations of body temperatures 
are much greater than those of adults, while in premature infants 
this mechanism is so ineffective that survival is often impossible 



408 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

without the aid of artificial means for keeping the body temperature 
within suitable limits. 

The advantage of a mechanism to free the organism from the 
effects of still another variable of its environment need not be further 
stressed. In analogy with the possible coimection between certain 
of the chemical characters of the living organism and the composi- 
tion of the medium in which it lived at different stages of its devel- 
opment, it might be suggested that the constant temperature of 
warm-blooded animals is also a perpetuation of conditions which 
prevailed while this mechanism was being developed. But even such 
scanty data as those on which the previously mentioned suppositions 
have been based are in this case lacking. 

The living organism is constantly liberating energy, part of which 
appears as heat. To preserve a constant body temperature it must, 
therefore, maintain a balance between the rates at which heat is lost 
and produced. This balance can be maintained by the exercise of a 
control over one or both of these rates. As one of the principal 
objects of adaptive mechanisms seems to be to protect the organism 
against adventitious variations of the rate of its activities, it might 
be expected that the control of temperature would be effected by 
regulation of the rate of heat loss rather than by variation of the 
rate of heat production. This expectation has, to a considerable 
extent, been realized in the warm-blooded animals which have been 
studied from this point of view in sufficient detail, the dog, and man. 

It has been found that when these animals are examined under 
comparable states of activity, the rate at which they produce heat is 
affected only to a minor extent, even by considerable variations of 
the temperature of their surroundings. Not only is the organism 
of these animals able to restrict the loss of heat from their bodies 
when the external temperature falls, but they are also able to con- 
tinue to lose heat to their surroundings, even when the external tem- 
perature is above that of their bodies. There are, of course, limits 
beyond which this mechanism becomes ineffective. If the external 
temperature rises too high, or if the conditions of humidity are such 
as to restrict unduly the loss of heat by evaporation, then heat pro- 
duction will exceed heat loss, and the body temperature will rise. 
The organism is incapable of decreasing its production of heat below 
a certain value even under these circumstances. 

If the external temperature falls to a low enough level, the mech- 
anism for regulating body temperature by controlling the heat loss 
also becomes ineffective. The body under these circumstances, how- 
ever, does not lose its power of maintaining a constant temperature, 
because it is able to increase its heat production until its heat loss 
is again balanced. The object of the constant body temperature, the 



ADAPTATION" TO ENVIRONMENT WARDLAW 409 

maintenance of a constant rate of metabolic activity under given 
conditions, is certainly nullified to some extent by this adjustment. 
The organism is outside of the range of perfect adaptation to the 
temperature of its environment. But, on the other hand, such con- 
ditions, even when the external temperature is extremely low, can be 
survived indefinitely without apparent detriment to the organism. 
On the whole, therefore, the organism can adapt itself to tempera- 
tures below that of its body better than it can to higher temperatures. 

RATE OF ADAPTIVE CHANGE 

As the range and the scope of the mechanisms by which the organ- 
ism is able to modify its environment increase, the necessity for 
adaptive changes on the part of the organism itself must correspond- 
ingly decrease. Thus we are led back to our original postulate that 
the more effective any adaptive mechanism is, the better does it 
enable the living organism to persist unchanged in a changing en- 
vironment. We should, therefore, expect evolutionary changes of 
structure and function to become progressivel}'- slower as we pass to 
more and more complex organisms, and the mechanisms which were 
at first developed to preserve the primitive characters of the cell 
itself, eventually to become so effective as to be able to preserve the 
characters of the whole organism. 

The organism which possesses, in an outstanding degree, the abil- 
ity to modify its environment is, of course, man. He controls his 
food supply by the hunting and rearing of food animals, by the 
gathering and sowing of edible plants. He modifies certain of 
his external conditions by the wearing of clothes and the erection 
and use of houses. He adds to the effectiveness of his hands by the 
use of tools. He increases the speed and the range of his movements 
by traveling in vehicles. By means of various instruments he adds 
to the acuity of his sense organs. All these external aids to his 
natural powers may be classed as tools. It is his ability to devise 
tools which has extended his ability to adapt his environment to his 
needs so immeasurably beyond the similar power of any other animal. 

One of the most striking features of this type of adaptive mech- 
anism is the extraordinary rapidity with which it has been developed, 
as compared witli the evolutionary modifications of bodily structure. 

The conjectures which have been made as to the period Avhich has 
elapsed since the appearance of living forms runs into hundreds of 
millions of years. The period for w^hich records can be obtained 
of the existence of man is measured, on the other hand, by hundreds 
of thousands of years. However vague those estimates may be, there 
seems to be little doubt that the enormous development of complexity 
which some living: forms have undergone has occurred within a small 



410 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

fraction of the time during which living organisms have been in 
existence. The development of the power of man to modify his 
surroundings as a result of the development of his mental faculties 
is a still more rapid and recent growth and is to be measured in 
centuries. Indeed, it may be claimed that man has expanded his 
powers in this direction more during the last century than during 
the whole of his previous history. 

We have in man, then, the most perfect adaptation to environ- 
ment shown by any form of life. So great is his power of modify- 
ing his surroundings, and so rapidly is this power increasing, that 
it would seem that further adaptation of his physical structures has 
become unnecessary. It has even been suggested that his increasing 
use of artificial mechanisms may bring about a degeneration of some 
of his bodily powers, and that any further evolutionary develop- 
ment in man may be restricted to the growth of his mental facul- 
ties. The past history of the evolutionary adaptation of living or- 
ganisms to their environment would, however, lead us to expect that 
any changes which may take place in the organism of man will not 
be such as would adversel}'^ afiect the conditions of life of the es- 
sential units of his structure. In so far as the changes which have 
taken place in his habits of life are really adaptations to his en- 
vironment, we may expect that their effect will be to establish more 
securely the primitive conditions of his cells. 

SUMMARY 

A characteristic feature of living organisms is the possession of 
mechanisms which protect them against the effects of changes of 
their environment. 

These mechanisms in the earlier forms exert their action by re- 
stricting the interchange which they allow between the organism and 
its surroundings. As the}^ develop in efficiency, they become more 
selective in action, and are able to preserve the essential characters 
of the organism while allowing a free interchange with its environ- 
ment. They have preserved, even in the higher organisms, some 
of the conditions of cell life which probably existed at very early 
stages of their evolution. 

When sufficiently broad distinctions of form are considered they 
are found to possess equall}^ distinct chemical features, for example, 
in the proportions of some of the elements which they contain. 

As the complexity of organisms has increased, they have rendered 
themselves more independent of their external environment by pro- 
viding their cells with an immediate environment of their own. By 
this means external changes are only allowed to reach the cells in a 
modified form. The possession of this internal environment enables 



ADAPTATION TO ENVIEOXMENT WARDLAW 411 

the organism to obtain the advantages of a freer interchange with 
its surroundings without endangering the stability of its essential 
living matter. 

The evolutionary development of the adaptive mechanisms of the 
organism has continually extended the range and scope of its con- 
trol over its environment. Examples of the most highly specialized 
forms of this control are the maintenance of a constant body tem- 
f)erature b}^ homoiothermal animals, and the provision of a special 
food supply for their young by mammals. 

As the effectiveness of the mechanisms for the adaptation of the 
environment to its needs has increased, the need for further adaptive 
modification of the organism itself has correspondingly diminished.

THE UTILIZATION OF AQUATIC PLANTS AS AIDS IN 
MOSQUITO CONTROL^ 



By Prof. Robert Matheson 
Cornell University 



[With 7 plates] 



Our knowledge of mosquitoes has been acquired in very recent 
years. Previous to 1898, the year in which Sir Ronald Ross an- 
nounced his epochal discovery that " dappled-winged " mosquitoes 
are the intermediate hosts of the malarial parasites, scarcely any- 
thing was known of these fiercely biting foes of man and animals. 
Their blood-thirstiness was well known, for in many portions of 
the earth man was unable to withstand their attacks and some of 
our fairest regions had to be abandoned to these tiny victors. Even 
to-day man is rather helpless before them. The writings of ex- 
plorers, travelers, etc., often contain accounts that give us a picture 
of the fierceness and terribleness of a mass mosquito attack. Since 
1898 we have acquired an immense amount of detailed information 
about the disease relationships, habits, life histories, biology, etc., 
of mosquitoes. To indicate briefly some of these advances seems 
worth while before attempting to outline the importance that plants 
may play in solving the problem of mosquito control. 

Previous to 1896 the life historj^ of practically only a single species, 
the common house mosquito {Culex pipiens)^ was known. In 1900 
Dr. L. O. Howard published the first account of the life history of an 
American anopheline. As Anopheles species are the vectors, and the 
only known vectors, of malaria, the study of these mosquitoes has 
been very intensive, especially since the World War. Malaria is 
probably one of the most widespread and most serious of all human 
diseases. Though quinine and its various derivatives are used ex- 
tensively in alleviating the attacks of malaria, they are not specific 
cures, and the only effective method is the control of the anopheline 
carriers. In 1900 Dr. Walter Reed and his associates announced the

discovery that yellow fever is conveyed from man to man by a 
mosquito, the so-called tiger mosquito {Aedes aegypti or Aedes 
argenteus or Stegomyia fasciata). This discovery greatl}'- increased 
the activities of the students of mosquito biology. Yellow fever is 
endemic to the Americas, but was established in west Africa some- 
time before 1900.- Recent outbreaks in Africa have aroused world- 
wide interest. Until 1928 it was confidently stated that only the 
tiger mosquito was the vector of yellow fever. Bauer (1928) has 
demonstrated that at least three other species may be vectors in west 
Africa.^ Long before this (1879) Sir Patrick Manson had shown 
that a round worm {FilaHa hancrofti) of man had a mosquito as 
its host for part of its life cycle. It was not, however, till 1900 that 
the method of transfer of this parasite was finally established. The 
variety of diseased conditions produced in man by this parasite is 
even yet not well known. This parasite is widespread throughout 
the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. 

Dengue, a febrile disease of man which often appears in epidemic 
form in the tropical and subtropical regions, was shown in 1903^ to 
be transmitted by a mosquito {Culex fatigans). Recent work seems 
to prove conclusively that Aedes argenteus^ the yellow-fever mos- 
quito, and Aedes alhojnctus are the vectors. In addition to these dis- 
eases of man, several animal diseases are transmitted by mosquitoes. 

The knowledge that mosquitoes are the vectors, and probably the 
only vectoi-s, of these serious diseases of man has led to a world-wide 
intensive study of mosquito biology. In 1900 some 242 species were 
known from the world. To-day probably over 3,000 species are 
recorded. All known species of mosquitoes pass their larval stages 
in water. They are known to breed in a great variety of aquatic 
environment — in ponds, slow-flowing streams, swamps, salt marshes, 
pools formed by melting snows, all sorts of artificial water containers, 
foul and clear water, reservoirs, rice fields, irrigation ditches, water 
in tree holes, in the water contained by the leaves of epiphytic brome- 
liads, in the water in the leaves of pitcher plants, etc. However, 
from all these studies we are beginning to learn what are the aquatic 
conditions essential for the breeding of each species of mosquito. 
This has led to more intensive studies of certain species to determine 
why certain types of aquatic environment are selected, and others, 
apparently identical as far as we can judge, are avoided. It was 
early recognized that not all types of water were selected by mos- 
quitoes, but it was not till the past few years that attempts were made 

* It is now believed that yellow fever had its original home in Wt-st Africa and was 
introduced into the Americas by the early navij,'ators and explorers. 

•At the present time (1932) at least 12 different specios of mosquitoes are known as 
transmitters of yellow fever (7 species for Africa, 2 for South America, 2 for the Far 
East, and 1, Aedes aegypti, of wide distribution).

to solve the riddle of this selective breeding. It may be admitted at 
once that this riddle is far from solved, though the chemical and 
physical properties and the fauna and flora of breeding places have 
been rather intensively studied by various workers. 

The early investigators, noting the absence of mosquito breeding in 
certain ponds, pools, etc., tried to offer explanations for such condi- 
tions. These explanations ran the gauntlet of a wide variety of sur- 
mises, usually observing that the water was unsuitable, that there was 
lack of the necessary food (though the food requirements were not 
then known and are not even at the present time), or that the exces- 
sive plant growth covered the surface of the water so as to prevent 
the larvae from obtaining air, or that filamentous algae were abun- 
dant in which the larvae became entangled and died or that numerous 
natural enemies, as predacious fishe?, insects, etc., were present. 

That aquatic plants may act as destroyers of living organisms was 
observed quite early. Mrs. Treat (1875) noted that the bladders of a 
TJtricularla sp. contained many organisms, including insect larvae, 
and she tried to solve the mystery as to how these animals were caught 
and if the plant used them as food. Darwin (1875) in his " Insectiv- 
orous Plants " gives a much more detailed account but failed to solve 
the mystery of how the organisms were trapped. Brocher (1911) 
fully solved the process, which was later confirmed by Hegner (1926). 
Different workers in various parts of the world have called attention 
to this group of carnivorous plants and their possible utilization as 
agents in mosquito control. 

PREDACIOUS PLANTS 

The commonest species is probably Utricularla vulgaris (pi. 1, 
fig. 1). It often occurs in great abundance floating directly below 
the surface of the water. The numerous small bladders and finely 
divided leaves distinguish it quite easily. The bladders are most 
interesting structures and have been fully described by Brocher and 
Hegner. These bladders, when " set " for the capture of prey, have 
their side walls rigidly compressed; organisms then enter the outer 
vestibule and by their movements stimulate the closing valve which 
suddenly opens, the side walls expand and the inrushing water car- 
ries the entrapped animal within. The valve then closes and the 
organism is firmlv held. Witliin the bladders the animals are 
gradually digested and furnish food for the growth of the plants. 
The enormous amount of food taken by those plants m^y be illus- 
trated by some of Hegner's observations. He found that the bladders 
on parts of a plant 220 cm (nearly 7 feet) long contained approxi- 
mately 150,000 small crustaceans, besides other organisms. From the 
standpoint of mosquito control the question may be asked, do these 



416 ANISrUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN" INSTITUTION, 19 31 

bladders capture mosquito larvae and how many? Franca (1922) 
observed them capture numerous larvae oiTheohaldia longiareolata 
and Anopheles hifurcatus; Brumpt (1925) records the capture of the 
larvae of Anopheles maculipennis and Culex apicdHs. During the 
summer of 1929, I carried on a few experiments with this plant to 
determine the rate of destruction and the size of larvae they could 
capture. Plate 2, Figure 2, shows a small branch containing 10 
active bladders. In five of these may be seen mosquito larvae in 
various stages of digestion. I have had them capture the smallest 
larvae and readily destroy the largest larvae I could obtain. Two 
preliminar}' experiments were conducted to determine the effective- 
ness of this plant in small aquaria. Two small branches were placed 
in a battery jar with 50 young larvae of Culex territdns. On the 
following day only two free larvae could be found; the bladders 
contained the others. During the next four days 375 larvae were 
added and practically all were captured, though toward the end of 
the experiment nearly all the bladders had dropped from the 
branches. How long a single bladder may live and how often it 
can capture such large prey as mosquito larvae, are not known. In 
another similar experiment, 225 larvae were added and practically 
all these were captured before the bladders began falling from the 
plant. 

In order to test the size of animals captured, large larvae of 
Brachydeutera argentata Walk. (Ephydridae, Diptera) were added 
to an aquarium with Utricularia. The results are shown in Plate 1, 
Figure 2. In cultures of Utricularia large numbers of these larvae 
were readily captured. Though only a small portion of the larva 
is first taken into the bladder, our observations show that eventually 
the entire larvae is absorbed. How tliis is done is not easily 
explained. 

Though the captured food of the Utricularia would appear to bo 
mainly small organisms belonging to the Crustacea, Protozoa, etc., 
yet it would seem that this group of plants deserves more considera- 
tion as a possible agent in mosquito control. The bladderworts are 
very graceful plants, grow luxuriantly where they occur and ought 
to make an added attraction in fishponds, small lakes, private pools, 
etc. Unfortunately we know very little about their biology or 
methods of their culture. 

SURFACE-COVERING PLANTS 

Another group of plants that has attracted considerable attention 
among students of the mosquitoes comprises the surface-covering 
aquatic plants. These plants are often packed so closely together 



PLANTS AND MOSQUITO CONTROL MATHESON 417 

that the entire surface is covered, causin<^ the larvae to die from 
Buffocation, or the plants in some way inhibit the female mosquitoes 
from laying their eggs in such situations. Smith (11)10) investi- 
gated the reported effect of a species of Azolla growing on the water 
in the canals of Holland. Here he found it in certain regions, the 
peat and turf areas, growing in such profusion as to cover the 
canals completely and prevent mosquito breeding. This plant seems 
to have restricted breeding areas, and though introduced into Amer- 
ica its growth was not very successful. Conflicting reports as to its 
value have since been published, but as far as I know no experi- 
mental work has been undertaken to test its reported value. Mac- 
Gregor (1920) thinks that Azallo fliculoides is a deterrent to ano- 
pheline breeding. He found no larvae or egg deposition in experi- 
mental tanks covered by this plant, whereas oviposition and breed- 
ing took place in near-by tanks containing other kinds of aquatic 
plants. Eugling (1921) states that the planting of Azolla in Alba- 
nia seems to favor the breeding of anophelines. Miihlens (1924, 
1925) reports that in parts of Argentina he found no mosquito 
larvae in pools and lagoons covered with Azolla sp. and Azolla fllcu- 
lokles^ whereas in near-by pools where these plants were absent 
mosquitoes bred in abundance. 

Various species of the Letrvnaceae (duckweeds) have been reported 
as effective water coverings (pi. 3). In New Jersey, Johnson (1902) 
found that no mosquito breeding took place wdiere the Lemna 
formed a complete mantle but where open spaces occurred Gulex and 
Anopheles bred in small numbers. Furthermore, Ze^^na-covered 
ponds harbor numerous predacious insects which attack mosquito 
larvae. Howard, Dyar, and Knab (1913) state that one of the most 
abundant breeding grounds of Culex saUnarius was a large marsh 
completely covered by Lemna. Bentley (1910) found that species 
of Lemna were of no value but that a related plant, Wollfia arhiza, 
was quite effective in the tanks in and around Bombay. In Sar- 
dinia, Fermi (1917) recommends the planting of Lemna 'palustris 
where oiling can not be employed. In Corsica, Kegnault (1919) 
reports that L.emna was successfully grown and prevented mosquito 
breeding. Whenever the Lemna disappeared breeding took place. 
In Russia, Vasilev (1925) found that wherever Lemna minor and 
Lemna polyrrhiza covered the surface no mosquito larvae could be 
found. Other workers present very conflicting reports, but the 
evidence of general observations would seem to indicate that the 
various species of the Lemnacae may prove of value in reducing the 
abundance of mosquitoes. Plate 3 shows an enlarged (magnified 
about seven times) view of Wollfia punctata and Lemna minor cov-

ering the surface of water. In ponds about Ithaca where these 
species grow in abundance few larvae are present. However, our 
knowledge of the growth or culture of these plants is very limited. 
A pond (pi. 4, fig. 2) which for years past had a compact covering of 
Leinna minor suddenly in 1929 became densely coated with Wollfla' 
punctata^ the Lemma occurring onl}'' in small patches. 

From all these conflicting observations one fact stands out clearly — 
that the study of the growth, culture, distribution, and usefulness of 
surface-loving plants deserves the especial attention of botanists and 
those engaged in the problems of mosquito control. This may be 
further emphasized by the report of Williamson (1928) that in 
Malaya the blue-green alga, Microcystis^ forms a dense scum in foul 
waters, and this accounts for the absence of anopheline larvae. 

NONSURFACE-LOVING AQUATIC PLANTS 

Though predacious and surface-loving aquatic plants deserve more 
study, those graceful plants belonging to the Characeae aroused the 
attention of mosquito workers when Cabellero (1919) announced 
that Chara foetida had a marked effect in inhibiting the develop- 
ment of mosquito larvae. This and his later studies awakened a 
renewed interest in the study of aquatic vegetation in relation to 
mosquito breeding. These studies have centered largely about the 
Characeae^ and numerous conflicting reports have been published in 
recent years. The various species of Chcvraceae (pi. 7, fig. 1) are 
beautiful and graceful plants often growing with remarkable vigor 
and forming a most pleasing bottom covering for otherwise un- 
sightly ponds. The species of Characeae are very difficult to identify, 
and many workers seem to be of the opinion that certain species do 
inhibit larval growth, while others have no effect. What are these 
species? This question has not yet been answered, for the experi- 
mental work with the various species has been very limited. Most 
of the published results deal with general field observations, and 
there is no indication by these various authors as to the exact con- 
ditions under which the observations were made. Was the Chara 
sp. growing vigorously? Were the ponds fouled with wastes? 
Were they temporary or permanent ponds? Were they spring fed, 
from overflows, surface water, or from other sources? In other 
words, an exact analysis of the aquatic environment is seldom given. 
In general, such workers as Allaud (1922) in Morocco, Langeron 
(1921) in Tunis, Maynar (1923) and Pardo (1923) in Spain, Federici 
(1928) in Italy, and Buhot (1927) in Australia have presented brief 
experimental data that seem to confirm the findings of Cabellero. 
On the other hand, the work of MacGregor (1924) in England, 



PLANTS A-RB MOSQUITO CONTROL, — MATHESON 419 

Barber (1924) in the United States, Fisher (1924) in Panama, 
Buxton (1924) in Palestine, Swellenfjrebel (1925) in Holland, Reyne 
(1924) in Surinam, Vasilev (1925) and Tarnogradski (1925) in 
Russia, and Hamlyn-Harris (1928; 1929) in Australia would indi- 
cate that the Characeae have little, if any, effect on mosquito breed- 
ing. Blow (1924) reports little mosquito breeding in Madagascar 
where species of Chara abound, but in 1927 he states that the 
Gharophyta {Characeae) possess no larvicidal qualities. Hacker 
(1922) reports doubtful results in the Federated Malay States. Such 
conflicting results would indicate that we know very little of the 
underlying factors that induce or prevent mosquito breeding. Every 
worker is fully aware that certain types of aquatic situations induce 
mosquito breeding, whereas other or even almost identical situations 
do not bring about breeding. In other words, we have what may 
be called the selective breeding habits of each species. What are 
the factors that control or govern such selective breeding habits? 

Early in 1923 I was impressed by such conditions in central New 
York and began a certain line of investigation in an attempt to 
answer some of these questions. The discovery of a permanent 
spring- fed pool (pi. 5, fig. 1) richly carpeted with a growth of 
Chara fragilis * enabled me to plan a line of work which might 
promise some results. In this pool, and similar ones since discovered, 
no mosquito breeding took place. It seemed ideal as a mosquito 
habitation. Farmhouses were located near by, and cattle grazed in 
large numbers in the surrounding pastures, so that the adults had a 
ready source of blood. Why, then, do mosquitoes fail to breed here? 
A few preliminary experiments made in 1925 seemed to indicate that 
the carpeting of Chara fragilis might be the inhibiting factor. Noth- 
ing further could be done till the spring of 1927. At that time I 
attempted to obtain answers to the following questions: (1) Does 
this species of Chara have an inhibiting effect on larval develop- 
ment? (2) Will mosquitoes oviposit readily on 67iflra-filled pools, 
and if they do what becomes of the larvae that hatch out? (3) If 
Chara has an inhibiting effect on the development of the larvae what 
is the causal agent? (4) Or, if the presence of Chara inhibits ovi- 
position what are the factor or factors involved? (5) What is the 
food of mosquito larvae? 

To answer the first question a long serious of experiments was con- 
ducted in aquaria in our greenhouse (pi. 4, fig. 1). The aquaria 
were stocked with Chara fragilis^ and the larvae of various species 
of mosquitoes were added from time to time. Water from a near-by

stream was used both in tEe Chara aquaria and in the controls. In 
the controls the larvae seemed to develop normally so whatever food 
was necessary was present in the water added to the Chara aquaria. 
The results of these experiments are briefly summarized in Table 1.°

The table is self-explanatory. Not a large variety of species was 
tested in the experiments, but out of 10,296 larvae there was an 
emergence of only 897 adults. In the controls our emergence records 
show that nearlj?^ all the larvae produced adults. What, then, is the 
factor or factors that prevented these larvae from completing their 
development ? I thought at first that the plant might produce some 
lethal substance, judging from the rapid death rate of the larvae. 
This, however, seemed to be ruled out, as a great abundance of Cy- 
clops, Daphnia, and other small Crustacea, as well as numerous phy- 
toplankton, thrived in the experimental aquaria. A factor experi- 
mented with was the pH values (acidity versus alkalinity). The ex- 
perimental aquaria and our Chara pounds showed a wide daily cycle 
of pH values, usually running from a pH of 7.6 to nearly 9.4 each 
day. The water was always alkaline and following MacGregor 
(1921) and Senior-Wliite (1926) I thought the changing alkalinity 
might account for the high death rate. Further experiments con- 
firmed the results of other workers that pH values have probably 
little to do with inhibiting larval development. The next factor 
was the study of the food requirements of the larvae. Could it be 
possible that Chara ponds and our Chara aquaria did not possess 
sufficient food for the development of the larvae? 

An intensive search of the literature showed that the main larval 
food consists of the zooplankton and phytoplankton organisms found 
in the water. These are swept in by the action of the larval mouth 
brushes, and everything that can be swallowed is taken in indis- 
criminately. Along with these substances is swept in a considerable 
amount of water. Fortunately I had begun an intensive study of the 
plankton of a typical mosquito-breeding pool and the spring-fed 



Full details may be found in the Amor. Journ. Hygiene, vol. 8, pp. 279-292, 1928.

Chara pond. This investigation "^ soon showed a greater variety and 
a much higher density of plankton organisms in our Chara pond 
and aquaria than that found in a typical mosquito-breeding pool. 
If plankton organisms are the food of mosquito larvae, here then 
was an abundant food supply and yet they died amidst plenty. 
However, I have never fully believed that plankton organisms con- 
stitute the entire larval food but that the larvae probably obtain 
most of their food from substances in solution in the water and 
from decaying organic wastes. My assistant was in the midst of test- 
ing this theory, and his preliminary results indicated that my thesis 
held true for the si^ecies with which he was experimenting.' If 
plankton does not constitute the main food of mosquito larvae but 
rather substances in solution and organic wastes, then the question is 
does the Chara remove these substances in solution so rapidly as to 
starve the larvae? Decaying organic matter is largely absent in 
Chara ponds, as one of their marked characteristics is the crystalline 
clarity of the water. I could find no way to test all these suppositions 
experimentally. 

There was still another factor which always excited my curiosity, 
more especially since the publication of Cleveland's work in defaun- 
ating the intestinal tract of termites with oxygen. As Chara gives 
off during the day an immense number of tiny bubbles of oxygen 
I felt fully convinced that the larvae must sweep hundreds of them 
into their intestines. What effect could the presence of oxygen 
have on the digestive processes of the larvae ? To test this I devised 
a rather simple apparatus. Pure oxygen was passed, under pres- 
sure, through Berkefeld filters N and W and entered the water in 
bubbles almost as tiny as those given off by the Chojra. Plate 1, Fig- 
ure 1 shows the apparatus in operation. Two cylinders are being 
treated with oxygen while two others serve as controls. The same 
water and food were supplied to all the jars. This experiment was 
conducted for a considerable time and a brief summary is presented 
in Table 2.

These experiments, and many others which were tried, indicate 
that the oxygen present in the water in small bubbles may be ingested 
by the larvae and may bring about a high death-rate. The larvae in 
the oxygen-treated cylinders appeared irritable, and though their 
intestines were filled with apparently normal food yet their growth 
was slow and they gradually dropped to the bottom and died. There 
was great difficulty in preventing the oxygen bubbles from accumu- 
lating at the surface. Wliether or not larvae could break through 
the surface film with their air-tubes remains unsolved. This may 
prove the real reason for the death of the larvae. However, the 
presence of the oxygen in the intestines (not proved, except by 
inference) may interfere with the digestive functions and bring 
about the death of the larvae. It may be recalled that Cleveland 
(1925) brought about the death of termites by defaunating their 
intestinal tracts by means of oxygen. In this case the oxygen killed 
the commensals (Protozoa) which converted the eaten wood into 
substances capable of being digested by the termites. AVhat oxygen 
may do in the intestinal tracts of mosquito larvae remains to be 
solved. 

In addition to the aquaria experiments with Ohara a long series of 
tests was conducted with wooden tubs sunk in the ground (pi. 5, 
fig. 1), with wooden tanks divided into compartments (pi. 6, 
fig. A) so that there would be Chard growths separated from the 
ordinary water by screens, and also to provide a method of testing 
Chara in still as compared with running water. The results of 
these experiments ^ were uniformly successful and gave additional 
evidence that Chara fragilis in some way prevented the develoj^ment 
of the larvae. 

The second problem, do females normally oviposit in pools con- 
taining vigorous growths of Chara^ was also tested experimentally. 
A series of aquaria filled with a growth of Chara fragilis was set 
up in our greenhouse (pi. 4, fig. 1). An abundant supply of the 
adults of two Culex species {C. p/'piens and C. territans), Anopheles 
pu7ictipennis, and Aedes aegyjM (the yellow fever mosquito) was 
at all times present in and about our experimental quarters. The 
results of these experiments are shown in Table 3. 

*A full account of these experiments may be found in the Araer. Journ. Trop. Med., 
vol. 9, pp. 249-266, 1922.

An examination of the table brings out a most important fact — 
that wherever there is decay and dying of the Chara oviposition by 
Culex species took place almost immediately. In experiments 1052- 
22 and 24 the Chara maintained a vigorous growth throughout the 
season and no oviposition took place. In those experiments in 
which considerable decay took place at the beginning, oviposition 
is recorded and most of the larvae which hatched from the first 
Qg^ masses matured. Those that hatched from egg masses deposited 
when the Chara was regaining vigor failed, in most cases, to mature. 
In those aquaria in which growth did not take place (1052-28, 42, 
43, 44, and 45) oviposition was exces.sive throughout the season and 
immense numbers of adults emerged. Yet despite this density of 
adults no oviposition took place in those aquaria containing a vigor- 
ous growth of Chara. Why mosquitoes do not oviposit on water 
containing a vigorous growth is not known. It may be added that 
no oviposition took place in our outdoor tubs or wooden troughs 
where Chara growth was vigorous. Oviposition always began when 
decay started and became excessive as the decay increased. 

These and other laboratory experiments appeared so promising 
that a survey of the local area was undertaken to discover if pools, 
ponds, lakes, etc., where Chara flourished were free from mosquito 
breeding. Numerous more or less isolated ponds were found with 
vigorous growths of Chara and in practically every case mosquito 
breeding did not occur. These results were so encouraging that 
attempts were made during the seasons of 1928 and 1929 to introduce 
Chara fragilis into as wide a variety of known breeding places as 
possible. This was done and several of these introductions were 
studied during 1928 and 1929. In order to understand the problems 



424 



ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 



of Ghara introductions the breeding habits of our northern species 
of mosquitoes must be borne in mind. All our Aedes species pass 
the winter in the egg stage, the eggs being deposited throughout the 
summer on the bottoms or margins of dried-out or greatly lowered 
pools. These eggs, with the possible exception of Aedes vexans^ 
do not hatch till the following spring. All our species of Culex^ 
Anopheles^ and most of our Tlieobaldia pass the winter as adults 
and oviposit on water during the following spring or summer. It 
will thus be seen that we have practically only one brood of the 
Aedes species each season, whereas there may be several broods of 
Culex, Anopheles, or Theohaldia species. There are exceptions to 
this general summary, but the main thesis holds true for the species 
under experimentation with Ghara. In any attempt to introduce 
Ghara into pools which dry up during the summer the question of 
the renewal of growth the following season was problematical. 
However, for a number of j^ears Ghara fragilis was found growing 
in temporary puddles which dried out each season, so it was thought 
that introductions into similar pools might prove successful. Fur- 
thermore, the kind of water which would support Ghara was not 
known, and no information was available on the culture, growth, 
etc., of Ghara species. 

It may be worth while to present the details of two introductions. 

Buttermilk Falls pool. — This pool (pi. 6, fig. C.) is rather 
small and is spring fed. It is about 8 feet in diameter and 2i/^ 
to 3 feet deep. Aedes canadensis breeds here in great abundance 
during the early spring and is followed by Aedes., vexans, Gulex 
apicalis, Gulex territans, and Anopheles punctipennis. The main 
object of the experiment was to obtain a good growth of the Ghara 
which might prevent the breeding of the summer species and also 
prevent the oviposition of Aedes canadensis and Aedes vexans. The 
results of this experiment are shown in Table 4.

1 During the rest of the season there was no growth of the Chara and no breeding took place. 

From Table 4 it will be observed that the Chara was added on 
April 9, 1928. At that time larvae of Aedes canadensis were very 
abundant. Growth of the Cham did not begin till about May 13, 
when the first pupae appeared. The development of the larvae 
was undoubtedly retarded, for pupation took place in near-by pools 
a week earlier. From June 7 till July 3 there was no breeding in this 
pool except a few larvae on June 7. In the near-by pools Aedes 
canadensis, Culex territans, and Culex aficalis were present in both 
the larval and pupal stages. Early in July the near-by pools became 
dry, and from then till September breeding took place in our experi- 
mental pool. It should be noted, however, that early in July (July 
3) a considerable area of decay appeared and this continued through- 
out the season. Breeding began with the appearance of decay, and 
this result agrees with that obtained in our experimental aquaria. 
Another point might be noted : Aedes vexans bred in near-by pools 
but was never found in the experimental pool. The results for 1929 
are not very encouraging. The Chara did not apparently survive the 
winter. It is hoped that growth may again appear in 1930. In 
1928 the larval density of Aedes canadensis was most extraordinary. 
A few sweeps of a small net brought in nearly 2,000 larvae, and 
immense numbers of adults emerged. In 1929 it will be seen we 
had difficulty in obtaining even 50 larvae. Whether this reduction in 
breeding was due to the Chara preventing oviposition in 1928 is 
difficult to say. Had the Chara continued to grow in 1929 we might 
be justified in concluding that Aedes canadensis refused to oviposit 
where Chara grows. However, as compared to near-by pools there 
was a reduction of mosquito breeding in 1928 and an even more 
marked reduction in 1929. The near-by pools swarmed with Aedes 



426 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

canadensis, whereas the Chara pool contained . an extremely small 
number of larvae. 

The woodland 'pool. — The woodland pool (pi. 7, fig. B) is a 
large pothole which usually maintains a water supply till late 
August or September. Here breed Aedes sthnidans, A. excruciajis, 
A. fitchii, and A. purictor. The larval density is usually very high, 
and immense numbers of adults swarm during the summer in the 
surrounding woodlands. Near by are numerous breeding places for 
these species so that if Chara would grow and maintain itself in 
this pothole we would have an excellent opportunity to test its 
efficiency. The introductions were made on April 14 and 21, 1928. 
During the summer of 1928 the Chara maintained a considerable 
growth, but in 1929 none could be found. Though the experimental 
pool had a high larval density in 1928, there were very few larvae 
in 1929. Unfortunately the near-by potholes, where there was a high 
larval density in 1928, had comparatively few in 1929. In fact, this 
whole woodland area, which usually swarmed with mosquitoes dur- 
ing the summer, had very few during the season of 1929. The reduc- 
tion was probably due to a salamander {Diemictylus mridescens) , 
which swarmed in all the pools during 1928 and 1929. This sala- 
mander has been shown to be a voracious feeder on mosquito larvae. 

Though numerous other introductions were made, none of them 
could be followed up in detail. Several new introductions were made 
in 1929, and I have hopes that some of these may prove more success- 
ful. Our failures are due, in all probability, to our ignorance about 
the biology and cultivation of the Characeae. Though I have worked 
with only one species, Chara fragilis, other investigators have em- 
ployed several other species sometimes with apparent success but 
unfortunately more often with failure. However, this line of work 
is directing more and more students to study the underlying factors 
of larval food, selective breeding habits of mosquitoes and the water 
conditions which induce or prevent mosquito breeding. 

OTHER AQUATIC PLANTS 

Little experimental work has been done with other aquatic plants. 
Zetek (1920) reports that in the Panama Canal Zone anophelines 
were found breeding in the floating islands and other masses of 
water lettuce {Pistia stratiotes). In Brazil, Bachmann (1921) 
found that mosquitoes appear to avoid Pistia stratiotes, MyHophyl- 
Uum hrasiliense, and Lemna. He states that MyriophylliuTn hrasil- 
iense is being planted along the streams at points where breeding 
places have been cleared away. In the southern United States, Bar- 
ber and Hayne (1925) find that anophelines breed amidst water 
hyacinth {Piaropis crassipes).

I did some work with another aquatic plant, Elodea {Phyllotria) 
caiiadensis (pi. 7, fig. 2). For a number of years this plant 
has grown in abundance in pools along a railway embankment. 
The pools seemed ideal places for mosquito breeding, yet larvae were 
rarely found. Three experimental aquaria were run under condi- 
tions similar to those used with Gliara. The results are shown in 
Table 5.

This table is self-explanatory. How are we going to account for 
the high death-rate? Furthermore, these aquaria were exposed 
practically the entire summer to the large numbers of adult mos- 
quitoes that were constantly emerging from our other aquaria, yet 
in not a single instance did we find an egg mass deposited on them. 
I have no explanation to offer for the results. If the experiments 
with oxygen can be successfully repeated with more species of mos- 
quitoes I would surmise that the excessive amount of oxygen given 
off in minute bubbles by this plant may oxidize the organic wastes 
too rapidly, destroy any foods in solution or, when ingested by the 
larvae, interfere with their digestive processes. 

The whole problem of selective mosquito breeding involves a fund- 
amental study of aquatic environments. Water which is everywhere 
so common and abundant, a substance essential to all life, a funda- 
mental necessity to every life process, is one of the most puzzling 
substances known. Though much has been attempted little funda- 
mental knowledge of water chemistry, of the physicochemical fac- 
tors of water, of water solutes and their exact constitution or re- 
actions, etc., has been gained. Until we know something more fund- 
amental about the physicochemical factors involved in the relation- 
ship of water to life processes we can scarcely hope to make much 
progress in interpreting the aquatic environments of living plants 
and animals.

There is necessaril57^ such a preponderance of emphasis on the 
losses man sustains through insects that a statement of the credit the 
hexapods are responsible for is occasionally desirable to maintain a 
correct mental perspective in regard to their relation with man's 
welfare. It is a common and logical principle in educational psy- 
chology that instead of setting up a long series of " don'ts " to regu- 
late childrens' conduct we aim to substitute legitimate and desirable 
activities for those we would prohibit. In a somewhat parallel man- 
ner much has been done, and much more may perhaps be accom- 
plished in the future, toward subduing injurious insects by estab- 
lishing beneficial forms among the undesirable species. Instead of 
creating a partial biological vacuum in nature by killing insects by 
artificial methods, we may plant a benefactor where a criminal rules, 
lest the house that is sw^ept clean and vacated be eventually filled 
with seven times more devils than at first. Obviously this plan has 
limitations inasmuch as effective checks do not exist for all pests. 

BIOLOGICAL CONTROL 

The method of combatting insect pests by the utilization of natural 
agencies that hold the destructive forms in check is, perhaps, the most 
fascinating chapter in the history of insect control and at once the 
least known by the people as a whole. The present attempt is only 
to prepare a brief, simple account of the growth, methods, and ac- 
complishments of this phase of warfare against insects. The sub- 
ject stated comprehends other phases of entomology than this, but 
the present article will be limited to a consideration of our friends, 
the parasitic insects. The term " parasitic " as used here is defined 
to include only such insects as live upon other insects, spending a 
whole stage or more on or in another individual which is designated 
the host.

Ever since man began supplying himself with food by tilling the 
soil, he has, no doubt, had to fight six-legged enemies of his crops. 
And when our agrarian ancestors made more or less intelligent ob- 
servations on them, they probably perceived also, though more rarely, 
that certain kinds make their living by preying upon, or by eating, 
the bodies of their own relatives. And as observations in the field 
of natural history became more purj)oseful and systematic, the idea 
of pitting the latter against the former, the benefactor against the 
foe, probably grew, in a few minds, to a conviction and a personal 
experiment, and eventually to practice. Doctor Howard (1)^ tells 
us that the " gardeners and florists in England for very many years 
have recognized the value of the ladybirds and have transferred them 
from one plat to another." But a similar use of parasites is not 
likely to have been made at that time on account of their small size, 
and chiefly because of the general lack of knowledge even regarding 
the nature of their habits. It is not too much to say that no one 
knew that such a phenomenon as parasitism existed until certain 
naturalists (1, pp. 16-17) discovered it in the seventeenth century. 
Aldrovandi, in 1602, is supposed (1, p. 16) to have been the "first 
to observe the exit of the larvae of Apanfeles glonieratus L.", a com- 
mon small wasplike parasite of the imported cabbage worm. But it 
was probably not until more than a half century later that Vallisnieri 
(1661-1730) discovered (1, p. 17) " the existence of true, parasitic 
insects " and the real nature of insect parasitism. " Reaumur (1683- 
1757) and DeGeer (1720-1778) each studied the life histories of liv- 
ing insects with great care and, among them, worked out the biology 
of a number of parasites." Ratzeburg observed the bionomics of 
Hymenoptera parasitic on forest insects, but did not believe that 
their efficiency could be increased by man. 

Hence, although several biologists had become familiar vrith the 
fact of parasitism, and apparently considered that man might utilize 
it in control, the artificial manipulation of parasites was not defi- 
nitely suggested until after the middle of the nineteenth century. 
Earlier hints at the feasibility of biological factors for pest control 
applied to predacious forms, chiefly the lady beetles and ground 
beetles, whose manner of checking their prey b}^ direct feeding was 
more easily comprehended generally. Hence, the movement for the 
use of parasitic insects in what we now call biological control has 
been begun and carried forward in the past nine decades, and the 
outstanding ingenious accomplishments of an extensive and practical 
nature are the work of the past 40 j^ears. and fall mainly within the 
lifetime of that chief enthusiast for, and sponsor of, the utilization

OUR FEIENDS THE INSECTS — BALDUF 433 

of insect parasites, Dr. L. O. Howard, who began urging biological 
control in 18S0 and is still engaged in his favorite field. 

THE NATURE OP PARASITIC INSECTS 

A very small number of the present population of the world is 
aware of the true nature of the white oval bodies seen so commonly 
on the backs of certain caterpillars. Aldrovandi, in 1G02, supposed 
them to be eggs which, he probably thought, gave rise to many more 
caterpillars to eat the rest of his crop. His supposition also im- 
plies that he was also unfamiliar with the phenomenon of meta- 
morphosis of moths and butterflies. The nature of these so-called 
" Gggs," their source, and their ultimate end could not be appreciated 
then, as now, until the fact of metamorphosis among the parasites, 
and their hosts as well, is understood. Parasitic insects that attack 
other insects have a common mode of development from the egn; to 
the parent, or adult stage. These friends of ours usually begin life 
as an egg which the parent places into, on, or near the host. Wasp- 
like parasites or Hymenoptera have hollow boring instruments, or 
ovipositors, by means of which the eggs are usually passed into the 
very bodies of their hosts, whereas two-winged flies or Diptera de- 
posit their eggs on the surfaces of the host, and the responsibility of 
entering the body of the latter belongs to the young parasite or larva. 
Certain true wasps, the Tiphiidae and Scoliidae, are parasitic upon 
beetle grubs in the soil, and their larvae are ectoparasitic, clinging 
to and feeding only on the outside of their hosts. The Rhipipho- 
ridae, a family of beetles, are also ectoparasites of white grubs, 
while the little-known minute twisted-winged parasites spend the 
larval stage in the bodies of wasps and leaf hoppers. When the 
parasite larvae become full-sized they do, or do not, leave the host, 
if they happen to be endoparasitic. Wasplike parasite larvae often 
spin silken cocoons, either in the empty shell of the host, or near 
by outside : the " maggots " or larvae of flies retain their last skin 
instead of shedding it as before, and live in it as a covering or pu- 
parium. In the puparium or cocoon the larva transforms to the 
adult stage, the process of transformation being called pupation, 
and the insect during the transition period is referred to as being a 
pupa or in the pupa stage. Each of the four stages — egg, larva, 
pupa and adult — is remarkably different from each of the others, 
for which reason this mode of development is named complete meta- 
morphosis. On the other hand, insects like the grasshoppers and 
true bugs have young resembling the adults in form and have only 
three stages, lacking the pupa. None of the insect parasites of other 
insects have this type of metamorphosis. Only the larval stage of 



434 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

parasitic insects feeds upon its host, which ordinarily lives only as 
long as necessary for the parasite to become mature. The parasites 
do not feed u^jon the vital organs of the host, but instead are nour- 
ished from the blood which flows about through the open spaces 
of the host's body, and from the fat body which represents the re- 
serve food supply of the victim. While residing in the host's body 
the hymenopterous parasite larva retains in its alimentary canal, 
which is saclike and closed behind, all the wastes from the digestive 
process. The waste materials are voided concurrently with the last 
moulting. 

It is a significant fact that all parasitic insects attacking others of 
their class have complete metamorphosis. The larva is no doubt 
more adaptable to a multitude of circumstances of life than the 
nymph tj'pe of young, such as is present in grasshopper life cycles. 
While limited in locomotor capacity, the larva has a flexible body 
capable of entering the soil or boring into and out of a host, and by 
its tenacious hold on the host, or by virtue of its position in the host, 
ceases to use, and has long since lost, all the legs it ever had. The 
parasitic larvae have been engaged in the business of living at the 
expense of others a long time, as witness the reduction of the legs, 
antennae, and mouth parts. That they once possessed these organs 
is suggested by the facts that some nonparasitic relatives still have 
them and that some parasitic larvae, notably of the ichneumonoid 
flies, retain their large falcate mandibles in the first larval instar but 
lose them when they moult the first time. While the nymphs of such 
external parasites as the sucking lice of mammals and the chewing 
lice of birds are parasitic, they do not exhibit the versatility in choice 
of and fitness for life in a considerable variety of host situations such 
as hymenopterous and dipterous parasitic larvae display. Among 
the many thousands of species of parasitic insects there is material 
for a very interesting study of the multiplicity of form and habit 
changes or adaptations, such as the means by which the parent gets 
its progeny upon or into the host, how and in what stage the parasite 
emerges again, and the variety of hosts it may attack. In a single 
superfamily, the ichneumonoids, we find one species an ectoparasite 
on caterpillars, another an internal parasite in a hard-shelled, swift- 
running beetle, a third in a minute, sluggish, soft-bodied plant louse, 
and a fourth more than a hundred times larger than the former and 
carrying a set of drills much longer than itself for reaching into the 
burrow of a tree borer which is the larva of another member of its 
own order. In fact, one stage or more of some member or members 
of practically all the 24 orders of insects are probably subject to 
attack by one species or another of parasitic insects. Furthermore, 
some parasitic larvae have come to attack other parasite larvae, and 



OUR FRIENDS THE INSECTS BALDUF 435 

the latter may be subjugated by a third parasite, which, better than 
anywhere else in the animal world, illustrates well the poem of the 
fleas that have lesser fleas, and so ad infinitum. We see, then, by 
these examples that parasitic insects are by no means limited to any 
particular place, host, or host stage, and still they are so bound to 
their habits by heredity that they select their hosts within certain 
group limits and die without progeny if certain hosts, or sometimes 
a single species of host, are not available. It is this relative uni- 
formity and, furthermore, their limitation to a parasitic life that 
makes them dependable for use in biological control. 

METHODS OF BIOLOGICAL CONTROL 

It is necessary to admit at once that the use of parasites to combat 
their injurious relatives has limitations. Where a native parasite 
of an indigenous pest already exists and fails to hold its host suffi- 
ciently in check, there is not much that has been done to increase 
the numbers of the benefactor, but new methods may possibly be 
originated in the future. Their rate of growth is much controlled 
by weather and the available numbers of the host, and men can 
scarcely hope to regulate these influences. However, even in the 
instance of native parasites various means of utilizing them are 
known or may be developed. It is a well known fact that winters 
reduce the numbers of parasites considerably below their status of 
the previous year. The host is likewise reduced, oftentimes, but the 
parasite can not reproduce extensively until its host is first plentiful. 
Consequently, the host is free to do more or less damage in the first 
months of the growing season, whereas the parasite requires a month 
or two to " catch up " or reach effective numbers. At present, proj- 
ects begun in California are under way in several States of this 
country to develop an abundance of the egg parasite {Tricho gramma 
minutum) of certain moths in laboratories during the early spring. 
They are then released in orchards for the control of the codling 
moth, or in southern fields to hold the cane stalk borer or celery 
leaf tyer in check, while the outdoor parasites are building up a 
controlling number. The method of securing the parasite in plenty 
is to use the Angumois grain moth which reproduces in stored grains 
indoors under warm conditions during the early spring and whose 
eggs can, therefore, be secured in large numbers. These eggs are 
exposed to the adult parasites which deposit their eggs into those 
of the moth. The life cycle of the parasite is short, hence a good 
number of generations is produced annually and many thousand 
individuals are reared quickly with proper mechanism and man- 
agement.

436 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

The variation in the beginning of the growth period from the 
north to the south extreme of the United States amounts to several 
weeks. For example, between southern Ohio and Illinois and the 
northern boundaries of these States there is, in the instance of some 
, crops, a difference of three weeks. As an illustration, let me cite the 
instance of the imported cabbage worm and its Apanteles parasite in 
Ohio. In the Muskingum Valley of that State early cabbage harvest 
is begun by the 4th of July, whereas some cabbages are only being 
set into the field in the north part at the same time. The chief 
pest of cabbage there is the imported cabbage worm, whose very 
efficient parasite was intentionally introduced from Europe many 
years ago to check the worm. In the first two generations the worm 
gradually develops injurious numbers, but the parasites also multiply 
rapidly. By the time that the cabbage crop is removed the parasites 
dominate the situation, but must soon be weakened in numbers again 
because the host grows scarce due to parasitism and many thousands 
of parasites die without reproducing. At this time the worm is 
probably doing its worst damage 200 miles north. Valuable cab- 
bages grown in the vicinity of large cities like Cleveland and Toledo 
are probably being injured, or artificial control may be practiced. 
Inasmuch as many thousands of the parasite may be gathered in a 
few days at Marietta, it would seem feasible to ship or carry such 
for release in the north parts to greatly supplement the work of the 
individuals present there and perhaps prevent severe damage to the 
crop and possibly avoid the extensive use of insecticides. 

Perhaps the most feasible mode of favoring parasites of insect 
pests is to modify slightly the application of certain other insect 
control measures. When a pest is known to possess one or more 
effective parasites, wholesale slaughter of the hosts should be avoided 
in order to permit the parasites to increase. For example, the large 
green injurious tomato and tobacco horn worms are freely parasitized 
by a small wasplike species whose mature larvae issue through the 
back of the host and spin their white cocoons there. When such 
cocoons begin to appear, many caterpillars could easily be assembled 
and placed in a screened cage, from which the parasites can go forth 
but which retains any moth that might have escaped the parasite. 
Many other insects might be kept at a minimum in this manner or a 
modification of it without excessive costs, if their parasites were 
better known and this method of biological control were studied with 
reference to them. Probably no other plan for the use of para- 
sites has been more frequently suggested in earlier times. 

In spite of careful State and interstate inspection service to pre- 
vent the spread of insect pests, some of these inevitably penetrate 
into new territory. Trade within and between States has been 



OUR FRIENDS THE INSECTS BALDUF 437 

instrumental in transporting or disseminating such insects. It 
occurs also that their parasites are not spread at the same time, 
permitting the host to multiply to unprecedented numbers and to 
greatly increase damage. The common asparagus beetle, a European 
species, is capable of causing severe loss under favorable conditions. 
In the East it is in part checked by a chalcid egg parasite, which, 
as far as known from several attempts to locate it in Ohio and Illi- 
nois, has not followed its host into all its present geographical range 
in America. On the other hand, the squash bug, a native species 
of general distribution, seems to be without its egg parasite in Illi- 
nois, whereas such a species is known to exist in the eastern States. 
Providing a more extended study of these and other insects should 
confirm such findings as the above, the artificial spread of the para- 
sites of these pests might be undertaken, and the parasites could 
probably be established with little cost or difficulty. Deserts, moun- 
tain ranges, or large bodies of water may act as deterrents or bar- 
riers to the spread of parasites into the areas which may be reached 
with relative ease by their hosts on account of their better equipment 
for long-distance travel. 

The most obvious as well as most productive use that can be made 
of parasites is based on the fact that some of our plant-eating in- 
sects are of foreign origin. These have usually come to our country 
without their natural enemies, hence multiply without limitations 
and constitute some of our " millionaire " insect pests. A few major 
examples are the European corn borer, the gypsy and brown-tai] 
moths, the Japanese beetle, the codling moth, and the imported 
cabbage worm. It has been recognized for about 40 years, since 
the gypsy-moth problem became acute, that one of the fundamental 
steps to take in attempts to control such imported and liberated 
pests is to study them in their native situations. These studies soon 
revealed that the insects were usually of relatively small importance 
in their old homes and that this difference in their status was caused 
by the work of one or more parasites. Thus was suggested the idea 
of bringing these parasites to this country, where it was hoped they 
would eventually perform the same good service as in their native 
lands. The result is that many species of parasitic insects have 
been introduced and successfully established here in the last four 
decades and with more or less of the desired effect. 

The procedure in such introductions naturally varies much due to 
the difference in habits of the parasites and their hosts and the 
advantage taken of earlier experiences for development of better 
methods of handling them. But the general essentials are as follows : 
Specialists in parasitic insects are sent by the States or usually the 
Bureau of Entomology of the United States Department of Agricul- 



438 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

ture to the native abode of the pests and their parasites. These men 
go for a year, or several years, or more, and establish laboratories in 
a crucial area where the host and its enemies are carefully studied 
before shipments of parasites to this country are attempted. Such 
studies are in the nature of bringing out facts that will lead to the 
intelligent manipulation of the parasites when they are transported, 
and even more for the sake of ascertaining whether the beneficial 
primary parasite may have parasites of its own, or secondary para- 
sites, which, if introduced, would more or less impair the efiiciency of 
the primary species. By means of laboratory technique the secondary 
parasites may be eliminated and a quantity of free primaries ob- 
tained for shipment. Other species have no secondary enemies. 
Native men, women, and children are employed to collect the para- 
sitized insects desired and deliver them at the laboratories. After 
their habits and life histories are studied, numbers of them are packed 
for shipment. They may be in the egg, larva, pupa, or adult stage 
when sent, the stage preferred being determined by the knowledge 
man has gained of the ways of the parasite and its host. Frequently 
the parasite is a larva in the egg or other stage of the host, or in a 
cocoon of its own, out of, or in, the hosts' body or cocoon. A conven- 
ient time to send some parasites is in a cold season, when they are 
naturally dormant due to low temperature, or if sent in a warm season 
they have frequently been stored in refrigerators at temperatures of 
40° to 50° F. on ship to prevent further development before they 
reach their destination. Or food and hosts may be supplied in cages 
to enable the parasite to continue its growth in a normal way in 
transit. If the parasite larva be in the host when sent, it may reach 
the pupa or even the adult state by the time it arrives after a journey 
lasting from one to two weeks. 

If the parasites make the trip successfully, they arc next placed 
in a laboratory to study further their habits, to determine whether 
hyperparasites may be present, and to develop large numbers for 
liberation. The breeding is done in many ways, depending again 
on the species concerned, and a considerable variety of cages and 
technique are employed. The hosts are provided in these cages to 
allow the parasites to multiply upon them. Usually when thousands 
are developed, they are taken, at the most opportune time known, to 
selected spots where the host is abundant, and where the environment 
is otherwise favorable to the survival of the parasite. Thereafter 
the parasite is dependent entirely on its own persistence in finding 
its hosts and in resisting the climate and other untoward influences. 
Sometimes our own parasites attack it, even when its native enemies 
have been left behind. Probably less than half the species intro- 
duced from other countries are established, or, if established may 



OUR FRIENDS THE INSECTS BALDUF 439 

be of minor importance as factors in host control. Success depends 
on so many influences that the entomologists concerned need have 
intimate knowledge of every phase that composes the parasite's en- 
vironment as well as of its habits and development. However, in 
spite of failures due to inadequate facts, the specialists who are close 
to the work are oj^timistic for the future, and Dr. L. O. Howard 
(2, p. 282) says " work of this kind is in its infancy, and its 
possibilities are great." It is necessary to point out again, however, 
that this method of combating insect pests is not advocated as a 
panacea for all insect troubles, and can not be regarded as a solitary 
substitute for any or all other methods now in use. 

INSTANCES OF PARASITE TRANSPORTATION 

The transportations of parasitic insects have by no means been 
to the United States alone, although this country started this type 
of work on a large scale. Porto Rico imported experimentally in 
1911-1913 from our own State certain wasp parasites {Tiphia sp.) 
for the control of the sugar-cane grubs which are related to the 
Illinois corn-root destroying white grubs. 

The mulberry scale threatened the silk industry in Italy (3), but 
it was almost completely freed of this pest by a minute parasite 
{Prospaltella herlesei) established there from America and Japan. 

Australia inadvertently received the woolly apple aphis, a notori- 
ous louse pest of the apple, because its covering of woolly secretion 
protects its body against ordinary contact sprays. The apple indus- 
try had prospered greatly in that favorable country until the arrival 
of this aphis. Professor Tilly ard, of Australia, with the aid of 
our entomologists, received importations of a small wasplike para- 
site from the United States where it holds this pest in check. The 
parasite is flourishing in Australia, and, as a result, the apple indus- 
try is doing the same. 

The larch forests of Canada have been severelj'' injured by an- 
imported sawfly, whose larva eats foliage. About 14 years ago, 
one of its foreign parasites was established, and by gradually increas- 
ing has now practical control of the host, the last reports indicating 
over 70 per cent mortality due to the parasite. 

The Hawaiian islands present a peculiar biological situation in 
that they originally harbored few native crop pests. By interna- 
tional commerce the sugar cane leaf hopper became established 
there, and created heavy losses amounting in 1903 to $3,000,000. 
By 1906 some species of egg parasites obtained in Australia were 
multiplying rapidly, and after 10 years Doctor Howard (3, p. 7) 
found that the leaf hoppers had been reduced to practical insignifi- 
cance. This is only an example of numerous other instances of com- 



440 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

plete success with imported parasites in Hawaii. But this case is 
not typical of most introductions into the United States and else- 
where, for the reason that parasites taken to Hawaii have no native 
secondary enemies awaiting them, hence multiply with extraordinary 
rapidity. 

Extensive attempts have been made with varying success to estab- 
lish foreign parasites of imported pests in the United States. Cali- 
fornia has always been a leading State in experiments with biological 
control, and (4) " because of the spectacular results of the introduc- 
tion of Vedalia the Australian ladybird, in the early days of Cali- 
fornia horticulture, the general public was inclined to favor this 
method of control to the exclusion of all others." The black scale 
" is still the most important pest of citrus in the State," and effective 
natural enemies are still being sought. 

From 1911 to 1913 (5) the cocoons of the parasite of the alfalfa 
weevil were sent to Utah where alfalfa culture was damaged by 
this snoutbeetle. By 1922 the parasite " was practically covering 
the weevil territory," and parasitism sometimes reached 85 to 90 
per cent or more. 

Generally, the appearance of a new insect pest of importance in 
this country is a signal for the beginning of a search for its para- 
sites. In the New England States thousands of acres of woodlands, 
and shade and forest trees have been defoliated at various times since 
1889 by the caterpillars of the gypsy and brown-tail moths, both of 
which are of European origin. Than this there is no more extensive 
instance of damage by introduced pests and there is scarcely an 
example of a more far-reaching attempt to control such pests by its 
introduced parasites. Since 1905 (6) " over 60 species of parasites " 
of these enemies of trees, " including predacious bettles, have been 
imported from Europe and Japan." Mr. Burgess indicates that 
many attempts failed, for " of this number 16 species have become 
established in New England. One-half of these have not become 
very abundant and are probably of slight importance." The dam- 
age, however, decreased " with more or less regularity until 1924, 
when only a small number of localized areas were defoliated." Ob- 
servations over many years indicate that the number of parasites 
fluctuates with the result that occasional injury of more or less ex- 
tent may be expected in the future. The same consequences will 
normally result in the instance of any other pest for whose control 
parasites are chiefly employed. The ideal of parasite importation 
in this and other instances is perhaps to find and establish a series 
of parasites, one or more attacking each stage of the host, and thus 
developing a sequence that will strike the host at various seasons of 
the year and perchance effect an adequate control in spite of varia- 



OUR FRIENDS THE INSECTS BALDUF 441 

tions in factors governing host and parasite abundance. However, 
this point of view has been criticized, and certain other plans may be 
more effective. 

While the gypsy and brown-tail moths were the occasions for the 
first large-scale biological control project of the United States Bu- 
reau of Entomology, others of large dimensions have since been in- 
stituted. The Japanese beetle is a relative of our common May 
beetles or white grubs. It was first seen in this country in New 
Jersey in 1916 and the grubs in the soil wrought havoc on lawns, 
meadows and golf courses since that date, while the adults have done 
likewise to foliage, flowers, and fruits in general. In 1920, the 
study of its natural enemies, including parasites, was begun in Japan 
(7), and up to January, 1927, nine species of parasites were found 
there and in Chosen (Korea). One of the three tachinid flies para- 
sitizing the adult beetle frequently destroys from 50 to 100 per cent 
of its host and this species, among other parasites, has been intro- 
duced into this country. Six other species attack the host in the 
larval stage. 

Among other pests of primary importance are the Mexican bean 
beetle, the Oriental fruit moth, and the European corn borer, all of 
which have occasioned the investigation of their native parasites, but 
those of the corn borer, the worst threat we ever had on our corn 
crop, deserve special mention. Although six two-winged (Diptera) 
parasites and seventeen wasplike species (Hymenoptera), all native, 
have been found attacking the eggs, larvae, and pupae here, "the 
combined parasitism " by these species " has totaled less than one per 
cent of the larvae and jDupae collected each year" (8). The native 
parasites are therefore " practically negligible except in the case of 
the sporadic egg parasite, Tricho gramma minutum Riley" (8). 
Eight species of Diptera and Hymenoptera that parasitize the corn 
borer in Europe had been liberated in the infested area of the United 
States up to February, 1927. Two of these {Microgaster tibialis Nees 
and Exeristes roborator) had been recovered incidentally at that time. 
It can not be predicted what the status of the imported species will 
be in the future. Ten years or more are sometimes necessary for a 
normal adjustment of parasites to their new surroundings and to 
reach their maximum efficiency, providing they become established 
at all. It is generally believed that parasites of the corn borer can 
not be expected to become an adequate check alone on this pest, the 
chief factor operating against a high proportion of mortality seem- 
ing to be the habit of the host of feeding sheltered within the corn 
stalk most of the time during the stages susceptible to attack. 

The amount of hope to be placed in the method of control by the 
use of entomogenous insect parasites is obviously various, according 



442 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

to the species considered. But whether they are in themselves suffi- 
cient to keep to an insignificant minimum the economic loss occa- 
sioned by their host, or must be supplemented by other methods of 
control, our friends, the parasitic insects, constitute one significant 
ally of man. Their importance does not permit them to be omitted 
from any program of control for foreign introduced pests, and 
furthermore, it may be truthfully said that the appreciation of the 
possibility of their use against native pests has probably only begun.

EVOLUTION OF THE INSECT HEAD AND THE ORGANS 

OF FEEDING 



By R. E. Snodgrass 
Bureau of Entomology, Umted Staltes Department of Agriculture 



The organs of feeding in nearly all animals are intimately asso- 
ciated with the head, because it is the head end of the body that goes 
forward in the usual modes of progression and is, therefore, the first 
to come into contact with the food. The head is at the anterior end 
of the body because the head was probably differentiated primarily 
as the sensory pole of the animal. The primitive head did not neces- 
sarily contain the mouth, and in some of the worms the mouth is 
still located near the middle of the ventral side of the body. 

The head of an insect is a composite structure formed of several 
of the j^rimitive anterior body segments. The mouth is located on 
the head and the principal external organs of feeding are appendages 
of some of the segments associated with the mouth. The head seg- 
ments are so closely united in the cranium-like head capsule that the 
primitive segmental areas are no longer discernible. The mouth 
appendages were undoubtedly at one time legs, but they have become 
so altered in adaptation to the feeding function that the primitive 
leg structure is seldom apparent in them and is often entirely oblit- 
erated. It is very difficult, therefore, to decipher the evolution of the 
insect head and the organs of feeding from a study of adult insects, 
and, though the development of the embryo throws some light on 
the subject, embryological evidence is always subject to various 
interpretations. Furthermore, the oldest known insects of the geo- 
logical records are so much like modern insects that paleontology 
gives little assistance in a study of the origin of insect structures. 
Probably no other group of animals have so effectively covered their 
evolutionary tracks as have the insects. 

It is an easy thing for anyone to becloud his intentions, or to 
create uncertainty as to his future course of action, but to keep his 
past a secret is quite a different matter. It often happens that in- 
formation on an obscure subject is more easily acquired in a round- 
about way than by going direct to the object of investigation. For

example, if we should wish to know something about some par- 
ticular person, we might find on an interview with him that he had 
forgotten many things of his past, which his relatives, with better 
memories in such matters, would readily divulge, if approached in 
the right way. So it is in the study of insects — their relatives in 
many cases will reveal things about them that we should never be 
able to get from the insects themselves. One reason why our under- 
standing of insects is not all that it might be is that entomologists 
have been too diffident in the matter of making intimate acquain- 
tances with arthropods other than insects. A formal letter of in- 
troduction to them, therefore, may not be out of place here, especially 
since the members of the arthropod classes will not be familiar to 
all readers under their scientific names. 

The Arthropoda are the " jointed-legged " animals, so named not 
because other animals do not have jointed legs but because the legs 
of arthropods are so conspicuously jointed. The familiar arthropods 
are the crabs, lobsters, crayfish, spiders, millipedes, centipedes, and 
insects. Associated with these forms, however, are many obscure 
relatives known for the most part only to zoologists. The following 
table will show briefly the way in which the Arthropoda may be 
classified according to their structural characters. 

CLASSIFICATION OF THE ARTHROPODA 

I. Chelicerata. — ^Arthropods in which the principal feeding 
organs, or chelicerae, are appendages of the first postantennal somite, 
and generally have the form of a pair of small pincers. The legs 
often have a segment, the patella, interpolated between the femur 
and the tibia. 

Eurypterida (extinct fossil forms). 
Xiphosura (liorseshoe crabs). 
Pycnogonida (spiderlike, marine arthropods). 
Araclmida (spiders, scorpions, ticks, mites). 

II. Mandibulata. — Arthropods in which the principal feeding 
organs, the mandibles, are appendages of the second postantennal 
somite, and have typically a jawlike form. A patellar segment 
is never present in the leg. 

Crustacea (shrimps, crayfish, lobsters, crabs, sowbugs). 

Symphyla (small, ccntipedelike relatives of the diplopods). 

Pauropoda (relatives of the the diplopods having only a few legs). 

Diplopoda ("thousand-legs," or millipedes). 

Chilopoda (centipedes). 

Hexapoda (proturans and insects). 

The insects comprise two principal groups, the Apterygota, or 
primitive wingless insects, and the Pterygota, including all winged 



THE INSECT HEAD SNODGRASS 



445 



forms, and wingless species that are undoubtedly descended from 
winged ancestors. The Onychophora {Peripatus and related genera) 
are sometimes classed with the Arthropoda, but these curious, many- 
legged animals are more evidently related to the annelid worms. 
The latter include the well-known earthworms and many worms that 
live in the ocean, all comprised in the Annelida, which also we shall 
have occasion to mention frequently in the following discussions. 



I. GENERAL STRUCTURE OF THE HEAD AND FEEDING ORGANS 

The head of an animal may be defined as the specialized anterior 
part of the body. The organs of feeding are, primarily, the mouth 
and whatever part of the alimentary canal serves for the ingestion 
of food; and secondarily, external structures functionally asso- 
ciated with the mouth. In insects, as we have seen, the head is a 
consolidation of several anterior body segments; the mouth is an

aperture on the ventral wall of the head; the ingestive part of the 
alimentary canal is the stomodeum; the external organs of feeding 
are appendages and lobes of the head associated with the mouth, 
known collectively as the mouth parts. 

C ephalization. — A head is a prominent feature in the organization 
of nearly all animals ; but all animals do not have a head to the same 
degree, which is to say, cephalization has not progressed equally 
far or accomplished the same results in all cases. The term cephali- 
zation (from Greek KtcftaXrj^, a head) means the structural specializa- 
tion of the anterior end of the body for whatever purposes the 
animal has found it advantageous to have its anterior end physio- 
logically specialized. Anatomical cephalization assumes that in 
the evolution of any group of animals there was a time when the 
ancestors of the group did not have a head or that the primitive 
head was nothing more than the pole of the body directed forward 
during progression. The habit of moving always with the same 



446 ANNUAL REPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

end forward, therefore, first established the distinction between a 
head end and a tail end in the animal, and was the precursor of 
cephalization. 

A good example of well-established physiological differentiation 
between the two poles of the body, but with a minimum of anatomical 
cephalization, is seen in the Annelida, or segmented worms (earth- 
worms and their marine relatives). The "head" of these worms 
consists only of a small apical lobe of the body, called the prostomium 
(fig. 1, Pst)^ which is highly sensitive and gives rise from its 
ectoderm to the first ganglion of the central nervous system, but 
it does not bear feeding organs, and the mouth (Mth) is located 
behind it. The annelids show also a good example of simple seg- 
mentation of the body, since the entire length of the worm behind 
the prostomium is divided by circular grooves into short body parts, 
or somites, commonly termed " segments." The mouth (Mth) lies 
in the ventral wall of the first segment, or between this segment 
and the base of the prostomium. The earthworms lack segmental 
appendages, but some of the marine annelids have a series of mov- 
able flaps along each side of the body, called parapodia (fig. 1 B, 
Ppd). 

The Arthropoda are segmented animals having much in the basic 
plan of their organization that resembles that of the Annelida; but 
in most respects they are far more highly evolved animals than are 
the segmented worms, and their complex segmental appendages, as 
we have seen, are characteristic features of their anatomy. In the 
arthropods, cephalization has progressed so far that the head con- 
sists not only of the prostomium but of a varying number of the 
anterior segments of the body, all intimately combined in a composite 
head structure. The head, moreover, retains most of the appendages 
of its component segments, which are structurally modified for 
various purposes, and its united nerve ganglia form specially 
developed nerve centers. 

The degree of cephalization, however, varies much even within the 
Arthropoda. A relatively simple head occurs in many of the Crusta- 
cea, in which the head consists of not more than three primitive body 
segments combined with the prostomium (figs. 2 A, 16 A, Pre). A 
head of this type of structure bears the eyes {E), two pairs of an- 
tennal appendages {lAnt, 2Ant), the mouth on its under surface, and 
a median prostomial lobe (Zm) before the mouth. The jaws {Md) 
and other appendicular organs that function in connection with feed- 
ing are carried on the body segments immediately following the 
head. In some other crustaceans, however, the segments of the feed- 
ing organs also are added to the head, and in such cases the entire 
head complex possibly contains as many as six or seven segments. 



THE INSECT HEAD SNODGRASS 



447 



The Diplopoda and Chilopoda have likewise a composite head struc- 
ture in which, so far as known, six segments are united in a cranium- 
like head capsule. The insects have a highly indi^ddualized head 
(fig. 2 B), in the composition of which there appear to be six seg- 
ments, or possibly seven. In the Chelicerata, on the other hand, most 
of the members have no distinct head, but this does not mean that 
they preserve the primitive annelid condition; on the contrary, in 
most of the Chelicerata cephalization has progressed so far that not 
only the segments of the true head region, but also the segments of 
the leg region of the body as well are all united into a large structure 
known as the ccflialotliorax. 

The insect head. — A typical insect head (fig. 3 A) is a craniumlike 
capsule supported on the body by the membranous neck {Cv). Its 
anterior lateral and dorsal walls are strongly sclerotized, as is also

bases of the head appendages as to be scarcely recognized as the 
floor of the head, and a large part of it is bulged out in the form of 
a median lobe, which is known as the hypopharytix {Hphy). 

The exposed, hard-walled part of the head is often called the 
" epicranium," but since different writers use this word with differ- 
ent restrictions, the term craniuin will serve just as well, or better, in 
a general sense to designate the skull-like part of the head in distinc- 
tion to the appendicular parts and the ventral area between the bases 
of the appendages. From the facial aspect of the head arise the 
antennae (fig. 3, Ant)^ and on the sides are located the coTwpoimd

eyes (E) . In many insects there are three simple eyes, distinguished 
as ocelli (O), placed on the top of the head or on the upper part of 
the face. From the lower part of the face there hangs before the 
jaws a free transverse lobe, the Idbrum (Lm). Behind the labrum 
are suspended from the lower lateral margins of the cranium three 
pairs of feeding appendages, or gnathopods {Md, IMx, 2Mx), which 
are' legs transformed into organs for manipulating and chewing the 
food. The cavity of the head communicates with that of the body 
by an opening in the posterior wall of the cranium, usually of large 
size (figs. 9 B, 13, For), commonly called the occipital foramen, 
though by analogy it corresponds with the fora^jien magnum of a 
vertebrate skull.

If we analyze a cross-section through the posterior part of the 
head (fig. 3 B) in terms of the structure of a body segment cut trans- 
versely, we arrive at the following results. The cranial wall above 
the dorsal articulations of the appendages (a, a) is the dorsum (Z>), 
and its sclerotization represents the tergum of a body segment; the 
ventral wall (F) between the lower ends of the appendage bases 
(6, h), including the hypopharynx {Hphy), is the venter, or region 
of a body segment that contains the sternum ; the ventrolateral areas 
(P, P), in which the appendages are broadly implanted correspond 
with the so-called pleural areas of a body segment; and finally, the 
appendages themselves represent a pair of legs, each with an enlarged 



THE INSECT HEAD — SNODGRASS 449 

basis {LB) bearing a pair of mesal lobes (Bnd), and a reduced, seg- 
mented distal shaft (Tlpd) corresponding with the part of a leg 
beyond the coxa. 

The neck, or cervix (fig. 3 A C'-y), is a membranous cylinder unit- 
ing the head with the first segment of the thorax (prothorax). 
Usually there are two small neck plates, the lateral cervical sclerites 
{cvpl), in each side of the neck serving to link the head with the 
thorax and to control the movements of the head on the body. The 
first sclerite of each pair articulates with an occifUal condyle (occ) 
on the posterior rim of the cranium; the second articulates with the 
anterior margin of the first lateral plate (ej)isternum) of the pro- 
thorax. In some insects there is only one plate on each side of the 
neck, and a few insects have no cervical sclerites, while, on the other 
hand, there may be several accessory neck plates, especially in the 
lateral and ventral walls of the neck. 

The mouth parts. — The external feeding organs of insects are 
known collectively as the " mouth parts." They include the labrum 
(fig. 3 A, Lm)., the hypopharynx (Hph/i/), and the three pairs of 
gnathopods. The first pair of gnathopods, or mandibles (Md), are 
typically, in biting insects, strong biting and chewing jawlike or- 
gans ; the second pair, or first maxillae {IMx) , known as " the 
maxillae " in insects, are usually more leglike than either of the 
others; those of the third pair, or second maxiUae {2Mx), are always 
united with each other in insects to form the single organ called the 
labium {Lb). 

The mouth parts undergo innumerable modifications of form in 
the various orders of insects by way of adaptation to different ways 
of feeding or to feeding on different kinds of food. They always 
preserve their basic structure and their fundamental relations to the 
head, but the ways in which the primary structure and relationships 
have become obscured create many perplexing problems for entomolo- 
gists to solve. Insects that feed by biting off, masticating, and 
swallowing pieces of their food material undoubtedly retain the 
more primitive type of mouth parts, and a study of the head and the 
organs of ingestion in species of this kind, known as the biting and 
chewing insects, will serve as a foundation for the study of the more 
highly specialized types, whose feeding habits are mostly sucJcing, or 
piercing and sucking. 

The mouth and the stomodeum. — The mouth of an insect is a 
median aperture in the ventral wall of the head immediately behind 
the base of the labrum (fig. 4, Mth). The space between the mouth 
parts is often erroneously called the " mouth cavity," and sometimes 
the "buccal cavity," but morphologically it is entirely outside the 
alimentary canal, and is only an external space partially inclosed by 
the mouth parts. It should be termed the preoral cavity {PrC). 



450 



ANNUAL REPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 



The true buccal cavity of the insect is the anterior part of the 
stomodeum lying immediately within the mouth (fig. 4, BuC). It is 
to be identified by the attachments of its dorsal dilator muscles 
{dlhuc) on the head wall, the origins of these muscles being always 
on the lower part of the face known as the clypeus {Glp). Ordi- 
narily the buccal cavity is small, but in some insects it is greatly 
enlarged to form a sucking pump.

Following the buccal cavity is the pharynx (fig. 4, APhy), a spec- 
ialized part of the stomodeum usually ending between the nerve con- 
nectives that unite the brain (Br) with the suboesophageal ganglion 
{SoeGng). The dilator muscles of the pharynx arise on the head 
wall above the region of the clypeus and on the tentorium {Tnt). 
In certain insects, particularly in Orthoptera and Coleoptera, the 
pharynx extends beyond the nerve connectives, and its two parts, 
separated by the nerve ring, are then distinguished as the anterior 
pharynx {APhy) and the posterior phai^nx {PPhy). In some suck- 



THE INSECT HEAD SNODGRASS 



451 



ing insects the pharynx and not the buccal cavity forms the sucking 
pump ; in still others the pump is a bucco-pharyngeal structure. 

Beyond the pharynx the stomodeum generally narrows to a tubular 
oesophagus {Oe). Posteriorly, however, the oesophagus often widens 
into a crop^ and in some insects the crop occupies almost the entire 
length of the oesophageal region. The stomodeum terminates in a 
proventrlculiis, from which a valvular fold of its wall projects into 
the stomach, or ventriculiis. 



II. EVOLUTION OF THE INSECT HEAD 

When we examine an insect embryo in an early stage of develop- 
ment (fig. 5 A, B) we see that its head consists of an enlargement

lohes. On this embryonic head there are later formed the eyes, 
the antennae (D, Ant), the mouth (Mth), and a median lobe before 
the mouth, which is the rudiment of the labrum (Zm). In addition 
to these parts, however, there has been observed in the embryo of a 
walking-stick insect (Wiesmann, 1926), and also of a centipede 
(Heymons, 1901), very small rudiments of a pair of preantennal 
appendages; and there are commonly present in insect embryos rudi- 
ments of a pair of postantennal appendages, though the latter are 
sometimes situated not definitely on the region of the cephalic lobes, 
but very close behind them (D, Pnt). 
102992—32 30 



452 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

The cephalic lobes of the insect embryo do not in themselves show 
any sign of division into segments, but the presence of three pairs 
of appendages on them, or closely associated with them, is taken 
as evidence that the cephalic region includes three primitive segmen- 
tal areas, and this assumption appears to be confirmed by the fact 
that the head region of the embryo contains three successive pairs 
of cavities (coelomic sacs) in the mesoderm. The assumed pro- 
cephalic segments, or primitive head somites, then, may be distin- 
guished according to their appendages in insects as the preantennal, 
the antennal, and the postantennal head segments ; though, according 
to the names given to the head appendages in Crustacea, they are 
called the preantennular, antennular, and antennal segments, respec- 
tively. 

In addition to the segmental areas in the procephalic region of 
the embryo, there is still the large, anterior apical area on which the 
labral rudiment is situated. This area, which some embryologists 
call the acron, would appear to be the equivalent of the prostomium 
of an annelid worm (fig. 1, Pst)^ since it is preoral in position. The 
acron has no true appendages, unless the labrum represents a pair 
of united appendages, but, according to some investigators, the com- 
pound eyes are developed upon it. Generally it has been supposed 
that the compound eyes belong to the first true segment, and since 
the eyes are borne on movable stalks in some Crustacea, it has often 
been thought that the eye stalks are the appendages of the first 
head segment. If it is true, however, that there are appendage 
rudiments on the first segment having nothing to do with the com- 
pound eyes, the appendage idea of the eye stalks must be discarded. 
In the light of recent comparative studies on the internal structure 
of the brain and optic lobes of annelids and arthropods (see Han- 
strom, 1928), it now appears certain that the compound eyes, the 
ocelli, and most of the forebrain of the arthropods must be assigned 
to the prostomium. The preantennal appendage rudiments have at 
most an evanescent embryonic existence ; the antennal rudiments be- 
come the antennae of the adult insect, or the first antennae (anten- 
nules) of Crustacea; the postantennal rudiments are also suppressed 
in insects, though perhaps they persist in certain species as small 
lobes of the mature head, but in Crustacea they become the large 
second antennae of the adult (fig. IC B, 2 Ant). 

If we attempt, now, to translate the facts of the embryonic develop- 
ment of the head into a phylogenetic concept, we must believe that 
the ancestors of the insects at some time in their history had a head 
corresponding with the region of the cephalic lobes in the embryos 
of modern insects. Since we have no record of earlier stages in 
the evolution of the arthropod head, though presumably such stages 



THE INSECT HEAD SNODGKASS 



453 



Pre. 



existed, we may call the phylogenetic equivalent of the embryonic 
head the fvotocefhalon. The protocephalon is preserved as the en- 
tire adult head in many Crustacea, as in the phyllopods (fig, 2 A, 
Pre) and in the shrimps, crabs, and lobsters (fig. 16 A, Pre). In 
insects, chilopods, diplopods, and some crustaceans it forms only the 
procephalic part of the definitive head. 

Looking again at an insect embryo in a late protocephalic stage 
of its head development (fig. 5 D), we observe that the body seg- 
ments immediately following the cephalic lobes have each a pair 
of well-developed appendage rudiments (iJ/c?, IMx^ 2Mx). These 
appendages do not differ at first from the leg rudiments (/>), but 
they do not keep up in growth with 
the legs, and in some insects the region 
of the legs, or thorax (fig. 6, Th)^ is 
soon differentiated from a region of 
three segments {Gn) between the tho- 
rax and the protocephalon {Pre). The 
appendages of these segments {Md^ 
iMx, 2Mx) become the mandibles and 
the two pairs of maxillae of the adult 
insect. The part of the embryonic 
body bearing them is termed, there- 
fore, the gnathal region. Before the 
insect embryo hatches, the gnathal 
segments are united with the cephalic 
lobes, and all the parts thus brought 
together are consolidated in the defin- 
itive head. Tlie intersegmental lines, 
with the possible exception of the line 
between the two maxillary segments, 
are completely obliterated, while the 
surface of the mature head capsule 
becomes secondarily subdivided by the lines of cuticular inflections 
forming internal ridges which strengthen its walls. The gnathal 
appendages constitute the principal external feeding organs of the 
insect. Being crowded forward on the ventral side of the head, 
the first pair, or mandibles, come to lie at the sides of the mouth, 
and are transformed into jawlike organs having a biting and 
chewing function. 

There is no doubt, from the embryological evidence, that the insect 
head has been formed from the union of two regions of the primi- 
tive trunk, the first region, bearing the eyes, the labrmn, the mouth, 
and the antennae, being the proeephalon, the second, bearing the 
gnathopods and the hypopharynx, the gnathocephalon. The idea

that the procephalon is composed of the prostomium and three post- 
oral somites, and that the gnathocephalon contains three somites is 
currently accepted by most entomologists as approximately repre- 
senting the facts, but there are several reasons for questioning if the 
evidence of segmentation in each of the two parts of the head has 
been rightly interpreted. 

A comparative study of the brain in the Arthropoda and Annelida 
leads to quite a different concept of the head segmentation than that 
derived from a study of the appendages. According to Holmgren 
(1916) and Hanstrom (1928), the three divisions of the arthropod 
brain, ordinarily assumed to correspond with three segments in the 
procephalic head region, represent only two primary nerve centers 
instead of three. The first of the two primary parts, these writers 
claim, represents the prostomial archicerebrum of the Annelida, and 
is secondarily differentiated into the definitive forebrain and mid- 
brain (protocerebrum and deutocerebrum) of the Arthropoda; the 
second primary part (tritocerebrum) is formed of the first pair of 
ventral, postoral ganglia, which have united with the primitive 
preoral ganglion, but retain their ventral commissure. 

As a corollary to this theory we should have to believe that the 
cephalic lobes of the arthropod embryo (fig. 5, Pre) represent the 
annelid prostomium, with the first (tritocerebral) segment generally 
more or less united with it. The preantennal and antennal append- 
ages, and the eye stalks of Crustacea then become organs equivalent 
to the annelid prostomial tentacles (fig. 1 B, Tl)^ while the second 
antennae are the first true segmental appendages. There is much 
in the structure of the brain and in the innervation of the head to 
support this theory. On the other hand, the preantennal and anten- 
nal rudiments of the embryo appear to be true ventral, postoral 
appendages homologous with the second antennae and the mouth 
appendages, and the presence of three pairs of coelomic sacs in the 
procephalic region indicates that there are here three true segments 
in addition to the prostomium. 

Another problem in the theoretical morphology of the insect head 
is one that concerns the number of somites that enter into the com- 
position of the gnathal region of the definitive head capsule, and 
the homologies of the mouth-part appendages of insects with those 
of the Crustacea. 

The insect mouth parts, as we have seen, include a median, tongue- 
like lobe of the ventral wall of the head, lying between the mandibles 
and the maxillae, known as the hypopharynx. In some insects the 
hypopharynx has a pair of lateral lobes, and in such cases the median 
part of the organ is distinguished as the lingua (fig. 7 A, Lin), and 
the lateral lobes as the superlinguae (Slin). The superlinguae are 



THE INSECT HEAD SNODGRASS 



455 



said to be developed in the embryos of more primitive insects sepa- 
rate from the lingua and somewhat anterior to it. They are, there- 
fore, regarded by some writers (Folsom, 1900, Denis, 1928, Hansen, 
1930) as a pair of true segmental appendages in the gnathal region 
of the head. In the apterygote family Machilidae the superlinguae 
have a structure suggestive of their being reduced appendicular 
organs (fig. 7 B), each having two terminal lobes (a, h), and near its 
base a small, palpuslike process (c). 

A hypopharyngeal structure similar to that of the apterygote 
insects occurs in some of the Crustacea (fig. 7 C), but the lateral 
lobes of the crustacean hypopharynx are called paragnatha (Pgn), 
and the median, lingual lobe is not always present (fig. 18 B). 
Because of the similarity between the superlinguae and the para- 
gnatha many students of arthropods, following Crampton (1921),

have regarded the two organs as homologous structures. Others, 
however, including Folsom (1900), Henriksen (1929), Hansen 
(1930), and Tuxen (1931), believe that the superlinguae are the 
first maxillae (maxillulae) of Crustacea, and that the paragnatha 
are not appendicular organs. Folsom (1900) claimed to have 
found in a collembolan insect that the superlinguae are innervated 
from a special center in the suboesophageal ganglion of the head, 
as does also Denis (1928), but the two investigators do not agree 
as to the position of the nerve center. On the other hand, Philip- 
tschenko (1912) denies the existence of a superlingual nerve center, 
and Hoffman (1911) asserts that the superlinguae are mere second- 
ary outgrowths of the head wall at the inner angles of the mandibles. 
The idea that the paragnatha of the Crustacea are segmental append- 
ages appears to have no champion, though Denis (1928) recognizes 



456

OSc 



it as a possibility. The paragnatha are said to be innervated by 
branches of the mandibular nerves. 

If the superlinguae are true appendages, the gnathal region of 
the insect head must contain four segments instead of three, as it 
does in some Crustacea. Then, if the paragnatha are not true 
appendages, the insect superlinguae must represent the first maxillae 
(maxillulae) of Crustacea, the maxillae the second maxillae (maxil- 
lae), and the labial ap- 
pendages the first pair of 
crustacean maxillipeds. 

The dispute as to the 
nature of the superlinguae, 
the number of segments in 
the gnathal region of the 
insect head, and the ho- 
mology between the mouth 
parts of insects and crus- 
taceans is now over 30 
years of age and appears 
to be destined to a long 
life. The best advice that 
can be offered to the stu- 
dent is that there is much 
to be said on both sides, 
which has already been 
said, and that some con- 
clusive evidence would be 
more convincing. The 
subject of the segmenta- 
tion of the arthropod 
head and the homologies 
of the head appendages 
between insects and crus- 
taceans has been reviewed 
recently by Denis (1928), Henriksen (1929), Imms (1931), and 
Tuxen (1931). 

III. STRUCTURE OF THE MATURE HEAD CAPSULE 

Wliatever may be the exact facts concerning the evolutionary 
history of the cephalic region of insects, the component elements of 
the mature cranial capsule are so closely consolidated in modern 
insects that entomologists can find little evidence of the lines that 
formerly demarked the constituent parts or segments. Only one 
constant suture of the insect head appears to have an intersegmental

value. This suture is a groove lying very close to the posterior rim 
of the cranium (fig. 8, pos)^ where it forms an inflection, or internal 
ridge, around the dorsal and lateral aspects of the foramen magnum. 
Since this suture lies behind the region of the head commonly called 
the occiput {Oc), we may term it the post occipital suture (pos). 
The narrow marginal rim of the cranium {Poc) set off at the base 
of the neck (fig. 12 A, Cv) by the postoccipital suture may be desig- 
nated, therefore, the postocciput {Poc). The postocciput is well 
developed in the cricket (fig. 9 B, Poc)^ and its internal inflection, 
the postoccipital ridge (PoR), is particularly large. 

One reason for regarding the postoccipital suture as an inter- 
segmental groove is the fact that the dorsal head muscles from the 
thorax are always attached on its internal ridge, just as the other 
longitudinal muscles of the body are attached on intersegmental 
ridges of the thoracic and abdominal skeletal plates. We might, 
therefore, regard the postoccipital suture as the true separation 
between the head and the prothorax, the neck being thus included 
in the latter; but evidence derived from embryonic development 
(Riley, 1904, Eastham, 1930) suggests, rather, that the postoccipital 
suture is the line of separation between the two maxillary segments 
of the head. The usual attachment of the maxillae on the head 
(figs. 8, a'', 12 A, Mx) before the lower ends of the suture, and that 
of the labium, behind the suture (figs. 8, a"\ 12 A, Lh) is in accord 
with this theory. If the second view is correct, then the postocciput 
of the cranium is a sclerotic remnant of the dorsal arch of the labial 
segment. Dorsal muscles of the labium, in this case, should arise on 
the postocciput, but since the labium ordinarily has no dorsal muscles, 
a crucial point in the evidence is missing. The region of the neck 
may be supposed to include a posterior membranous part of the 
labial segment, and the anterior part of the first thoracic segment. 

We have already observed that in the Crustacea the dorsal plates 
of the two maxillary segments are always intimately fused, as in 
Euhirmchipus and Anaspides (figs. 2 A, 16, V + VI), in which 
respect the crustaceans appear to differ from the insects. In both 
of these crustacean forms, however, the mandibular segment is 
separated from the maxillary segment by a distinct suture (y), 
which suture is possibly represented in the thysanuran insect Machilis 
(fig. 2 B) by the suture on the back part of the head (?/) that ends 
ventrally between the bases of the mandibles and the first maxillae. 

The sutures of the head. — Aside from the postoccipital suture, 
the surface of the cranium is usually marked by other impressed 
lines, collectively termed "sutures," which are characteristic fea- 
tures of the head, though they all appear to be of secondary forma- 
tion. The so-called sutures of this type have no significance in 



458 



ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 



themselves — most of them are merely the lines of inflections form- 
ing internal skeletal ridges which strengthen the cranial capsule, 
but the sutures divide the head walls into areas that are convenient 
units for descriptive purposes. The cranial sutures are not always 
present, but those described in the following paragraphs recur so 
frequently that they are regarded as typical features of the insect 
head. 

On the top of the cranium there is in many insects a median 
coronal suture (tigs^ 8, 9 A, 10, cs). Anteriorly the suture forks 
into two frontal sutures^ which, when complete, diverge downward 
on the facial region (fig. 8, fs) between the bases of the antennae, 
to the neighborhood of the anterior mandibular articulations (c).

In the cricket (fig. 9 A) the coronal suture is but weakly marked, 
and the frontal sutures end at the lateral ocelli. In the cockroach 
also the frontal sutures are incomplete (fig. 10). Both the coronal 
and the frontal sutures are often entirely suppressed, and in some 
cases secondary sutures branch from the coronal suture and diverge 
laterad of the antennal bases. During molting the cuticula of the 
head usually splits along the coronal suture, and may extend down 
one or both of the frontal sutures; but there are many exceptions 
to this rule, as in caterpillars, where, in all but the last molt, the 
head capsule breaks off at the neck. 

Near the lower margins of the lateral walls of the cranium there 
is usually on each side a horizontal s-ubgenal suture (fig. 8, sgs), 



THE INSECT HEAD SNODGRASS 459 

which when fully developed extends forward from the posterior 
tentorial pit (pt) in the lower end of the postoccipital suture to a 
point just above the anterior articulation of the mandible (c). The 
part of the subgenal suture between the two mandibular articula- 
tions {c, a') is sometimes distinguished as the pleurostomal suture 
(ps), and the part behind the mandible as the hypostomal suture 
{hs). Very commonly the anterior ends of the subgenal sutures are 
connected across the face by an epistomal suture {es). The subgenal 
sutures are well developed in both the cricket and the cockroach 
(figs. 9, 10), but in the roach the epistomal suture is absent. 

The anterior tentorial pits of pterygote insects (fig. % at) are 
always located somewhere in the pleurostomal or epistomal sutures, 
but their position in the sutures is subject to much variation in dif- 
ferent insects. In the cricket (fig. 9 A) each " pit " {at) is a long 
slit occupying almost the entire length of the pleurostomal suture 
and extending a considerable distance into the epistomal suture. 
More commonly the pits lie entirely within the epistomal suture, 
and are often carried upward on the face with the dorsal arching of 
the suture common in many insects. 

Extending across the back of the cranium there is in some insects 
an occipital suture (fig. 8, ocs), which may reach downward on the 
lateral head walls to the subgenal sutures. An occipital suture is 
well developed in most Orthoptera, as in the cricket (fig. 9 B, ocs)^ 
along the line w^here the dorsal and lateral walls of the cranium are 
inflected into the posterior wall. The postoccipital suture (Pos) 
has already been described. It is always present, but if the post- 
occiput (Poc) is absent, the postoccipital suture becomes merely a 
groove marking the line of attachment of the neck membrane to the 
posterior rim of the head. 

Still other sutures frequently occur in the head wall, but they are 
less constant than those described above. Often an ocular suture 
(fig. 8, os) surrounds the compound eye; and generally the antennal 
socket is encircled by an antennal suture (a^), the internal ridge of 
which strengthens the rim of the socket. In the cricket a suhocular 
suture (fig. 9, A, sos) extends from the compound eye to the subgenal 
suture, and in the roach a subantennal suture (fig. 10, sas) extends 
from the antennal socket to the subgenal suture. These sutures are 
sometimes called " fronto-genal " sutures, but it is doubtfid if the 
part of the head wall immediately before them belongs to the area 
of the true frons (fig. 8, Fr). 

The areas of the head. — The head areas are merely the spaces be- 
tween the head sutures. They are often called " sclerites," but they 
must not be thought of as plates united along the sutures ; they are 



460 



ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 



simply the result of the secondary division of the cranial wall by 
the linear inflections, or " sutures," forming the internal ridges. 

Above the line of the subgenal and epistomal sutures there are 
five principal head areas (fig. 8). On the face between the frontal 
sutures is the median, triangular frons {Fr). The side walls of the 
head between the frontal and occipital sutures, separated above by 
the coronal suture, are the parietals {Prtl), inclosing the compound 
eyes and the antennal sockets. The top of the two parietals is 
known as the vertex, and the parts below the eyes are the genae. 
On the back of the head, between the occipital and postoccipital su- 
tures, is the occiput, or 
occipital arch (Oc). 
The dorsal part of the 
arch is usually termed 
the occiput in a more re- 
stricted sense (fig. 9 B, 
Oc), and the lateral 
parts the postgenae 
{Pge). In the grass- 
hopper Melanoplus a 
suture on each side sep- 
arates the dorsal occipi- 
tal area from the lateral 
postgenal areas. The 
posterior rim of the cra- 
nium behind the post- 
occipital suture is the 
postocclput (fig.8,F6>c). 
The postocciput bears 
the occipital condyles 
(occ) by which the an- 
terior neck plates artic- 
ulate with the head (fig. 12 A, cvpl). In most insects the postocciput 
is a narrow sclerotic flange to which the neck membrane is attached 
(fig. 9 B, Poc) ; but it is often much reduced, except for remnants 
bearing the occipital condyles (fig. 13), and it is sometimes com- 
pletely obliterated. 

Below the line of the subgenal and epistomal sutures (fig. 8, sgs, 
es) there is on each side of the head a narrow marginal band above 
the bases of the mouth parts (fig. 12 A), and on the front of the 
head a broad area, known as the clypeus (figs. 8, 12 A, Glp), which 
supports the labrum (Lm). Just as the parts of the subgenal su- 
ture lying before and behind the posterior mandibular articulation 
(fig. 8, a') are distinguished for descriptive purposes as the pleuro- 
stomal suture (ps) and the hypostomal suture (hs), so the corre-

spending parts of the subgenal strip may be distinguished as the 
pleurostoma (Plst) and the hypostoma {Est). In conformity with 
this nomenclature, the upper part of the clypeus is sometimes called 
the epistoma^ though, when the clypeus is divided, its parts are more 
commonly termed the anteclypcus and the postclypeus. The pleuro- 
stoma is usually a small but distinct subgenal area above the mandible 
(fig. 9 A, Plst) ; the hypostoma is typically a narrow marginal band 
of the postgenal area of the cranium (figs. 9 B, 13, Est) , but in some 
insects, as in lepidopterous larvae and in adult Hymenoptera and 
Diptera, the hypostomata are greatly enlarged and extended medi- 
ally on the ventral wall of the head, where, in the higher Hymenop- 
tera and Diptera, they are united into a continuous hypostomal 
bridge. The epistomal-pleurostomal-hypostomal marginal area of 
the cranium constitutes the peristome. 

The internal skeleton of the head. — The ventral edges of the 
cranium are usually braced by an internal skeletal structure known

as the tentorium., which, in the absence of a substantial floor to the 
cranium, gives attachment to the ventral muscles of the mouth 
appendages. The tentorium, in its typical form (fig. 11 A), con- 
sists of a transverse posterior tentorial har {TB) extending through 
the back part of the head between the posterior tentorial pits {pt., pt) , 
and of two longitudinal anterior tentorial arms {At., At), arising 
at the anterior tentorial pits {at, at) and uniting posteriorly with 
the transverse bar near its lateral extremities. The whole structure 
is formed by four cuticular invaginations, the roots of which are 
marked by the external pits. In many insects the posterior ends 
of the anterior arms are approximated (fig. 11 B), and they may 
be united in a broad median plate (C). By such modifications the 
tentorium in appearance often departs radically from its more prim- 
itive structure. The central plate is called the corpotentorium 
(C, CT), and the lateral parts of the transverse bar become the 
posterior tentorial arms (B, C, PT, PT). Branches from the ante- 



462 



ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 



rior arras commonly extend upward to the facial wall of the head 
and attach to the latter in the neighborhood of the antennal bases. 
These branches constitute the dorsal tentorial arms (B, DT). 

The posterior tentorial bar always forms a bridge between the 
lower ends of the postoccipital suture; it never departs from this 
position. The roots of the anterior arms vary in position, though 
in pterygote insects they always lie somewhere in the pleurostomal 
or epistomal sutures. In most of the apterygote insects, however, 
the anterior tentorial arms arise from the ventral wall of the head 
near the base of the hypopharynx. In their origin, therefore, the 
anterior arms are sternal apophyses, on which the ventral muscles 
of the mouth appendages take their origin. It can not be explained 
exactly how the primitively ventral arms have acquired lateral or

facial attachments on the walls of the cranium in pterygote insects, 
but the altered position of their bases has come about probably 
either by a lateral migration before the mandibles, or by the estab- 
lishment of secondary connections with the cranial walls accompa- 
nied by a loss of the primary sternal connections with the floor of 
the head. 

Modifications in the form of the head. — The relative size or the 
shape of an insect's head is no index of the brain power of the 
insect; on the contrary it usually expresses the strength of the jaws, 
or some other quality connected with feeding. In the biting and 
chewing insects the parietal areas of the cranium are often enlarged 
to accommodate the jaw muscles; in sucking insects the facial area 
may be amplified to provide space for the muscles of the suction 
pump. 



THE INSECT HEAD SNODGRASS 463 

With most of the more generalized insects the frontal aspect of 
the head is directed forward, and the mouth appendages hang 
downward from the subgenal margin. A head having this position 
(fig. 12 A) is said to be of the hypognathous type. The hypognath- 
ous type of head undoubtedly preserves the primitive relation of 
the cranium with the body, because the mouth appendages are modi- 
fied legs, and in the pendent position they correspond with the legs, 
and retain the embryonic position of the primitive appendages. 

There are many insects, however, in which the frontal aspect of 
the head is turned upward, and the mouth appendages are directed 
forward. When the cranium has this relation to the body (fig. 12 
B), the head is of the prognathous type. The prognathous position 
of the head is unquestionably a secondary one, as is shown in the 
structure of the cranium. The back of the head usually maintains 
the primitive relation with the neck (B, Cv).^ but the forward 
position of the jaws has involved a lengthening of the ventral head 
wall and the basal region of the labium (Smt). In many prog- 
nathous insects, particularly in Coleoptera, the posterior tentorial 
pits (pt) have been drawn forward on the ventral head wall, and 
the lower ends of the postoccipital suture (pos), which terminate 
in the pits, have been correspondingly lengthened by a forward 
extension on the ventral side of the cranium. The suture continued 
anteriorly from each tentorial pit is the subgenal suture {sgs), which 
ends at the anterior tentorial pit (at) in the usual manner. 

The position or structure of all the mouth appendages is more or 
less affected by the transformation from the hypognathous to a 
prognathous condition. The hinge line of the mandible (fig. 12 B, 
Md) comes to approach a vertical position. The maxillae are car- 
ried forward on the ventral side of the head, since they retain the 
normal articulation with the hypostomal margins of the head im- 
mediately behind the mandibles. It is the labium that is most 
affected by the change. Its basal region becomes greatly elongate 
between the ventral extensions of the postoccipital suture and the 
posterior, or hypostomal, parts of the subgenal sutures, and appears 
to be a plate of the ventral wall of the head. The part of the labium 
posterior to the tentorial pits {pt) is now called the gula {Gu). 

A concrete example of the structure of a prognathous head in the 
Coleoptera is well shown by the head of a blister beetle (fig. 13). 
The postoccipital rim of the cranium is here almost obliterated, 
except laterally where it bears the large occipital condyles {occ). 
The ventral parts of the postoccipital sutures (pos), however, are 
extended forward on the ventral side of the head to the posterior 
tentorial pits {pt, pt), and they separate the enlarged gular area 
of the labium {Gu) from the postgenal regions of the cranial wall.

The parts of the postgenal sutures lying at the sides of the gula are 
distinguished as the guJar sutures. The sutures extending forward 
from the tentorial pits are the hypostomal sutures (/is), which 
diverge anteriorly to the lower margins of the compound eyes (E), 
and set off distinct hypostomal areas {Est) behind the bases of the 
maxillae {Mx). 

IV. GENERAL STRUCTURE OF 
ARTHROPOD APPENDAGES 

When we come to study 
the appendicular organs of 
the head associated with 
the mouth, by which insects 
obtain their food, we must 
bear in mind that these 
structures are legs modified 
for purposes of feeding. 
The primitive feeding legs, 
or gnathopods^ were not 
necessarily like the tho- 
racic legs of insects, which 
are specialized locomotory 
organs, but it is probable 
that they resembled the 
locomotory appendages, or 
pereiopods, of modern Ar- 
thropoda more closely than 
the members of any other 
specialized group of ap- 
pendages. 

An appendicular organ 
having a locomotor func- 
tion must be movable on 
the body. Movement im- 
plies the presence of muscles so attached on the base of the append- 
age that the muscles and the appendage together will constitute a 
definite mechanism capable of a specific kind of action. Since we do 
not have any examples of really primitive arthropods, and could not 
study the muscular system if we had a fossil specimen of one, we can 
only construct an imaginary picture of the mechanism of a primitive 
arthropod appendage from theoretical considerations. But, inas- 
much as unknown truth in actuality must take some specific form, a 
theory has at least a chance of being right. There can be little ques- 
tion, now, that a primitive locomotory appendage turned forward

and rearward on a vertical or approximately vertical line of flection 
between its base and the side or ventrolateral aspect of the body seg- 
ment to which it was attached. It must have had, therefore, fvomotor 
and reTYiotor muscles; and, if so, it is reasonable to assume that these 
muscles took their origins on the dorsum and on the venter of the 
segment supporting the appendage. We have thus a very simple pic- 
ture of the mechanism of a primitive limb (fig. 14, Appd)^ or loco- 
motor appendage capable of turning forward and rearward on a 
dorsoventral axis («-&) with the body by dorsal promotor and re- 
TThOtor muscles (/, e/), and ventral promotor and remotor muscles 
{K^ L). A concrete example of this type of limb musculature may 
be found in the annelid worms provided with parapodia, and like- 
wise in the worm-like peripatids (Onychophora). From this begin-

ning we may follow in our imagination the evolutionary course of the 
appendage into a more efficient organ of locomotion with a more 
diversified structure and mechanism. 

An appendage movable only at its base, such as the annelid para- 
podia, can be at best only a crude organ of progression. The 
arthropods owe their superiority over the worms to the greater 
efficiency of their appendages. 

The first step in the development of the appendages in the primi- 
tive Arthropoda, it would seem, must have consisted of a functional 
division of each organ into a basis (fig. 15 A, LB), and a distal 
shaft, or telopodife {Tlpd). The appendage as a whole having al- 
ready a basal movement in a horizontal direction, the telopodite 
must naturally have moved in a vertical plane on the basis, and it 
then must have had levator and depressor muscles {0, Q) arising in 
the basis. The baso-telopoditc joint {ct) can be identified apparently 



466 



ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 



in the limbs of all present-day arthropods by the uniformity of its 
movement and musculature. 

The next step in line with greater mechanical improvement in the 
appendage produced a point of flexure near the middle of the telo- 
podite (fig. 15 B, ft)^ enabling the distal part of the latter to be 
more effectively brought down against the support. Hence, in all 
fully developed arthropod limbs there is a " knee " joint (C, ft) in 
the telopodite with a principal downward movement of the part 
beyond the knee.

We may thus conceive of the early arthropods as being centipede- 
like creatures with a series of legs on each side of the body, the legs 
all jointed in the same way, and moving by a uniform kind of motion. 
The appendages all turned forward and rearward on the body ; they 
all turned upward along the line of the baso-telopodite joints; and 
the distal parts uniformly bent downward at the knee joints. Subse- 
quently the major parts of the telopodite of each limb have been stili 
further segmented (fig. 15 C, D), and in some arthropods the basis, 
too, appears to have been subdivided (C, LB). 



THE INSECT HEAD SNODGKASS 467 

If we define a limb segment {'podite^ or yodomere) as any mova- 
ble section of the appendage individually provided vvnth muscles, 
it is found that in the Crustacea, Myriapoda, and Hexapoda each 
fully developed appendage has six segments in the telopodite. There 
are two sets of names applied to the limb segments, one set generally 
used by entomologists, the other by carcinologists, as follows : First 
trochanter^ or hasijpoditc^ (fig. 15 C, IT7') ; second trochanter^ prae- 
feinur^ or ischio'podite {2Tr) ; femur, or meropodite {Fin) ; tibia, or 
carpopodite (Th) ; tarsus, or propodite {Tar) ; and praetarsus, claw 
segment {Krallenglied.), or dactylopodite {Ptar). In the legs of 
most insects the two trochanters are fused into a single segment, and 
in some Hymenoptera a subsegment resembling a trochanter is con- 
stricted from the base of the femur. The tarsus is often secondarily 
broken up into two or more subsegments, but the tarsal subseg- 
ments are never provided with muscles. A different type of seg- 
mentation occurs in some of the appendages of most of the Cheli- 
cerata (fig. 15 D), in which there are two segments intervening be- 
tween the femur and the tarsus, the first called the patella {Pat)^ 
the second the tibia (Th). 

The limb basis becomes functionally the most important part 
of a gnathal appendage. In the Arachnida and in most of the 
Crustacea the basis is a single segment, known as the coxopodite 
(fig. 15 D, LB). In the legs of Chilopoda and Hexapoda, however, 
the basis appears to include two segments ,the suhcoxa and the coxa 
(C, Sex, Cx), the first of which becomes an immovable support for 
the rest of the limb incorporated into the body wall. The primitive 
hinge between the subcoxa and the coxa was probably vertical, since 
it replaces the primary articulation of the limb with the body; but 
in the legs of many insects it has undergone various modifications. 
The basis of the mouth appendages may also be subdivided into a 
proximal and a distal part, the so-called cardo and stipes (fig. 19, 
Cd, St), but it is questionable if these parts are equivalent to the 
subcoxa and coxa of a leg. 

Finally, we should observe that in most of the arthropod groups 
some of the appendages may be provided with accessory lobes borne 
by the limb segments, and often furnished with inuscles arising in the 
segments to which the lobes are attached. Lobes on the outer margin 
of an appendage are distinguished as exites, lobes on the inner margin 
as endites. In the Crustacea an exite of the first trochanter (ischi- 
opodite) often forms a large branch of the appendage, known as the 
exopodite. Endite lobes are particularly developed on the gnathal 
appendages, where they have special functions in connection with 
feeding.

V. MOUTH PARTS OF A CRUSTACEAN 

It was recommended in the introductory section of this paper 
that entomologists should not confine their investigations to insects, 
since valuable information bearing on the structural evolution of 
insects may often be obtained from members of related groups of 
animals. Specialization is a necessity, but it should not be carried to 
the extent it is practised in some institutions, where it is regarded as 
a breach of professional etiquette for a specialist in one group to 
acquire any first-hand information in the field of another specialist. 

In sleuthing out information by the method of examining the rela- 
tives of an animal under investigation it is always important to be 
able to pick out a communicative subject. On the island of Tasmania 
there live two little fresh-water crustaceans, named Anaspides and 
Paranaspides. An interesting account of the life and habits of these 
two isolated creatures is given by Miss S. M. Manton (1930). 
Paranaspides inhabits the Great Lake of Tasmania situated at a 
height of 3,700 feet. Anaspides lives on Mount Wellington in 
streams and pools provided with running water, mostly above 1,400 
feet and up to an altitude of 3,600 feet. The general appearance 
and attitudes of these crustaceans, as shown in Miss Manton's col- 
ored plates, are very much like those of such apterygote insects 
as Machilis and its relatives; but we must be cautious of assuming 
an}' close relationship between insects and crustaceans, though their 
appearance and even their structure may be in some cases strikingly 
parallel. However, Anaspides and Paranaspides are relatively prim- 
itive members of the group of crustaceans (Malacostraca) that in- 
cludes the shrimps, crayfish, and crabs, and a study of their mouth 
parts will give a very plausible suggestion of how some of the 
structural features of insect mouth parts may have been evolved from 
ordinary leg structures. The feeding habits of Anaspides and its 
relatives, described by Cannon and Manton (1929), are of course 
different from those of any insect, but functional differences do not 
often obscure fundamental structural similarities. 

Through the interest of Dr. Waldo L, Schmitt, of the United 
States National Museum, the writer has been able to make a personal 
study of specimens of Anaspides tasinaniae (fig. 16). As already 
shown in the description of the head, the large mandibular segment 
of Anaspides {B, IV) is followed by a composite segment {V+ 
VI+VII) bearing two pairs of maxillae (i Mx, 2 Mx) and the first 
pair of maxillipeds {1 Mxp). The maxillipeds are typical, leglike 
appendages, each composed of seven segments (fig. 17 A). The 
first segment is the basis (LB), usually called the coxopodite {Cxpd) 
by students of Crustacea. The next three segments are the first

and second trochanters {ITr^ 2Tr) and the femur {Fm). At the 
end of the femur is a kneelike bend in the limb, followed by the

ci g >- oi ;g 



tibia {Th), the tarsus {Tar)^ and the praetarsus (Ptar). The seg- 
ments evidently correspond with the segments of an insect's leg, 
and are therefore here named according to the entomological leg 



470 



ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 



nomenclature. The shaft of the limb beyond the basis constitutes 
the telopodite. 

The most important feature of the first maxilliped of Anaspides, 
for our present purpose, is the presence of lobes borne on its basal 
parts. Viewed from the side (fig. 17 A) it is seen that the basis 
carries two long exite lobes {lEx, 2Ex), and that a third exite 
{3 Ex) arises from the proximal end of the first trochanter. Turn- 
ing the limb outward (B), it is to be observed, furthermore, that 
the basis is provided also with two mosal lobes, or endites. The 
first endite we may call the lacinia (Lc), and the second the galea 
(Ga), since these are familiar entomological names for similar 
lobes of the maxillae. Considering, now, that there are two exite 
lobes and two endite lobes on the maxilliped basis, it might be argued 
that the apparent single basal segment of the appendage is really 
formed by the union of two more primitive segments, each provided 




Figure 17. — First maxilliped of Anaspides tasmaniae

lobes ; Oa, galea ; Lc, lacinia. Other lettering as on Figure 15. 

with an exite and an endite. If this is really the case, the basis, or 
coxopodite, of the maxilliped is composed of a coxa and a subcoxa, 
which have become united. There are certain other theoretical rea- 
sons for believing that the basis is a compound segment, but the 
visible facts do not in themselves give support to the idea, and the 
writer prefers to take the facts at their face value. The basis, there- 
fore, is here assumed to be a single segment bearing two exite lobes 
and two endite lobes. 

The two pairs of appendages that precede the maxillipeds are the 
first and the second maxillae. The maxillae are small, flat append- 
ages (fig. 18 C, D, E) having no suggestion of the leglike form of 
the maxillipeds, but on close inspection it is to be seen that each 
differs from a maxilliped simply in the reduction of the telopodite 
(Tlpd) and in an elaboration of the basis. In other words, each 
maxilla is mostly the basis of an appendage, bearing the two endite 
lobes {Lc, Ga) but having no exites, and supporting a rudimentary

telopodite. The appendage is attached to the body in such a way 
that its principal motion is in a transverse plane, and its strongest 
muscles are the adductors {KL). 

The second maxilla (fig. 18 C) has in some respects a more simple 
structure than the first. The dorsal part of its outer wall is bent 
toward the articulation with the lateral wall of the body, evidently 
to give more effectiveness to the groups of adductor muscles {KL)

which arise on a sternal plate {2MxStn) in the ventral wall of the 
body. The basis of this maxilla is thus mechanically differentiated 
into a proximal part {Cd) and a distal part {St), which may be 
termed cardo and stipes, respectively, since they suggest the parts 
so-named in the maxilla of an insect. The maxillary endites of 
Anaspides {Lc, Go) appear to have no muscles; but the small, one- 
segmented telopodite {Tl/pd) is provided with two muscles {O, Q) 
taking their origins in the stipital region {St) of the appendage. 



472 ANNUAL KEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

The first maxillae (fig. 18, D, E) have a structure similar to that 
of the second maxillae, but they differ from the latter in a number 
of details. The body of the a'ppendage is divided by a distinct line 
of articulation between the cardo {Cd) and the stipes {St)^ and is 
provided with strong sternal adductor muscles {KL) inserted on 
both the cardo and the stipes. The dorsal musculature consists of 
two groups of promotor fibers (/) and a group of remotor fibers {J). 
The promotors are inserted on the base of the cardo and on the 
distal end of the stipes ; the remotors are inserted on the basal angle 
of the lacinia (E, Lc) . The endite lobes of the first maxilla are well 
developed. The lacinia {Lc) is an independent plate attached by 
membrane to the stipes; but the galea {Go) is a direct continuation 
of the distal part of the stipes. The telopodite (Tlpd) is reduced 
to a peglike rudiment arising from the stipes at the base of the 
galeal lobe. As we shall see, there are many points of resemblance 
between the first maxilla of Anaspides and the maxilla of an insect. 

Lying immediately before the first maxillae and behind the man- 
dibles is a pair of large, flat, transverse lobes, the paragnatha (fig. 
18 B, Pgn). The paragnatha hang downward from the anterior 
end of the median sternal plate of the first maxillary segment, which 
has a median channel ending at the base of the narrow cleft between 
the bases of the paragnathal lobes. The possible homology of the 
crustacean paragnatha with the insect superlinguae has already been 
discussed (p. 455), and we have observed that the paragnatha in 
some Crustacea are intimately associated with a median sternal 
lobe (fig. 7 C), the three forming a composite organ much resembling 
the insect hypopharynx, and having the same situation between the 
mandibles and the first maxillae. 

The mandibles of Anaspides are strong jaws (fig. 18 A) suspended 
from the mandibular segment, to which each is articulated by a 
single dorsal point of articulation {a') with the inner surface of the 
overlapping lateral lobe of the tergum. Ventrally the free end of 
each jaw is produced into a large lobe {Bnd), subdivided into a 
distal, toothed incisor part, and a heavier, proximal molar part. 
Laterad of the base of the terminal lobe arises a three-segmented 
telopodite, or palpus {Tlpd). It is clear that each mandible of 
Anaspides consists of the limb basis of an appendage {LB), bearing 
a large, immovable endite lobe {Bnd), and of a small, segmented 
telopodite {Tlpd). The mandibular basis shows no subdivisions 
corresponding with the cardo and stipes of a maxilla. 

The musculature of the Anaspides mandibles is characteristic of 
the musculature of all arthropod mandibles that are movable on 
single points of articulation. Each jaw is provided with two dorsal 
muscles (fig. 18 A) and strong ventral muscles. The dorsal muscles 



THE INSECT HEAD SNODGRASS 473 

consist of an anterior promoter muscle (/) and a posterior remoter 
muscle (/), both arising on the tergum of the mandibular segment 
and inserted on opposite edges of the mandible. These two muscles 
evidently serve to rotate the jaw, or to swing it forward and back- 
ward on its dorsal point of articulation (a). The ventral muscles 
(KL) are adductors. They consist of two groups of fibers. The 
fibers of a dorsal group form a flat muscle band extending continu- 
ously across the median line from one mandible to the other. The 
fibers of a much larger ventral group for each jaw arise medially on a 
ventral ligamentous membrane (k) between the mandibles, and 
diverge laterally to their insertions within the cavity of the mandible. 
The supporting membrane apparently arises from the ventral wall of 
the mandibular segment; it turns posteriorly over the adductor 
muscles, where it gives attachment to several small muscles not con- 
nected with the mandibles, and is suspended by a number of slender 
ligaments arising dorsally on the mandibular tergum. The jaws have 
no muscles antagonistic to the adductors ; they probably relax by the 
elasticity of their connections with the body. 

VI. GENERAL STRUCTURE OF A GNATHAL APPENDAGE 

The study of the mouth parts of Anaspkles leaves little doubt that 
the maxillae and the mandibles have been derived from appendages 
resembling the first maxillipeds, which latter, in turn, are clearly 
but slightly modified legs. The essential difference between a gna- 
thal appendage and a locomotory appendage is that, in the former, 
the emphasis is placed on the basis, while in the latter it is given 
to the telopodite. 

In the maxillae, as clearly shown in Anaspides (fig. 18 C, D, E), 
the basis of each appendage is differentiated for mechanical effi- 
ciency into a proximal cardo, and a distal stipes. The distinction 
between these two parts of the basis is a characteristic feature of the 
maxillae of all insects (figs. 19, 21 C, Cd, St). The basis of the 
mandible in Anaspides (fig. 18 A) is undivided, as it is also in all 
other crustaceans and in the insects and the centipedes (Chilopoda). 
In the millipedes (Diplopoda), however, the mandibular basis is 
subdivided into two parts apparently corresponding with the cardo 
and stipes of a maxilla. Hence, we might infer that the differentia- 
tion of the basis into a proximal and a distal part was a primitive 
character of all the gnathopods, though, on the other hand, if we 
assume that the subdivision 'of the basis is a secondary mechanical 
adaptation, it is possible that the cardo and stipes have been inde- 
pendently differentiated in the diplopod mandibles, and possibly 
also in the maxillae of insects and crustaceans. 



474 



ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 



The presence of endite lobes on the basis is particular!}^ charac- 
teristic of the gnathal appendages. The presence of two such lobes, 
lacinia and galea, is typical of the maxillae of crustaceans and insects 
{^. 19, Lc, Ga). The maxillary lobes are usually movable. When 
the lobes are provided with muscles, the muscles always (in insects.

at least) take their origin in the stipes (flcs, fga), except a muscle 
often associated with the lacinia (fled), which arises on the head 
wall, and therefore apparently belongs to the dorsal promotor system 
(/) of the basis. 

The mandibles have each only a single terminal lobe. In the 
Diplopoda the mandibular lobe is freely movable on the basis, and is 



THE INSECT HEAD SNODGEASS 475 

provided with muscles like those of a maxillary lacinia ; in the chilo- 
pods it is likewise movable on the basis, but is not so definitely articu- 
lated with the latter as in the diplopods ; in the Crustacea and insects 
the mandibular endite is always amalgamated with the basis, and the 
jaw thus becomes a single, unified appendicular organ without mov- 
able parts (fig. 20). The most simple representatives of the mandi- 
bular ajjpendages occur in the Chelicerata, in which the organs have 
the form of shortened legs, called the pedipalps. The basal segment 
of each pedipalp, however, may have a large endite lobe closely 
associated with the mouth. 

Considering the mouth parts of the Arthropoda generally, there 
can be little doubt that the mandibles as well as the maxillae have 
been evolved from leglike appendages. It seems highly probable, 
moreover, that in the Mandibulata the mandibles first attained a 
structure similar to that of the insect maxillae, but, being the most 
anterior in the series of gnathal appendages, they have since de- 
parted more radically from the typical structure in their evolution 
into biting and chewing jaws. The first maxillae of insects, in their 
more generalized form, would appear to retain very closely the primi- 
tive structure of a gnathal appendage. The crustacean maxillae are 
generally more reduced and simplified than those of biting insects; 
the maxillae of the chilopods evidently have never departed far from 
the leg structure ; the corresponding appendages of diplopods are so 
highly specialized that it is impossible to judge what their primitive 
structure may have been. 

The structure and musculature typical of an insect maxilla is shown 
diagrammatically in Figure 19. The similarity to the maxillae of 
Anaspides (fig. 18 D, E) is striking. The reduction of the telopodite 
in the maxillae of Anasjndes is a mere detail — the maxillary palpi 
are better developed in some other Crustacea. In the insect maxilla 
the body of the appendage, or basis (fig. 19, LB)^ is membranously 
attached to the lateroventral aspect of the head by its entire inner 
margin, but it is definitely suspended from the lateral ventral margin 
of the cranium by a single dorsal point of articulation {a") on the 
base of the cardo. The cardo {Cd) and stipes {St) are separated by 
a distinct suture, or line of flexibility, which ends in the basal mar- 
gin of the appendage. The cardo and stipes thus do not have the 
relation of segments to each other. The stipes bears distally a mov- 
able lacinia {Lc)^ and a movable galea {Go). The telopodite, or 
palpus {Tlpd), is generally well developed; the number of its 
segments is variable, but the segmentation suggests that of a leg 
(fig. 15 C). 

The musculature of a maxilla includes extrinsic and intrinsic 
muscles. The extrinsic muscles arise on the head wall, or on endo- 



476 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

skeletal processes of the cranium, and are inserted on the cardo and 
the stipes. The principal extrinsic muscles are the adductors (fig. 
19, Klt)^ the fibers of which arise on the tentorium (Tiit), and are 
inserted within the cardo and stipes. They are evidently the primi- 
tive ventral promoters and remoters of a generalized limb (fig. 14, 
K, L), the origins of which have been carried into the head with the 
development and transposition of the anterior arms of the tentorium. 
The other extrinsic muscles are usually but two in number. One 
is an anterior rotator of the maxilla (fig. 19, rtmxa) inserted on the 
cardo anterior to the articulation {a") of the latter with the head; 
the other {flee) is inserted at the base of the lacinia, and functions as 
a cranial flexor of the lacinia. These two muscles appear to repre- 
sent the dorsal promotor of a generalized limb (fig. 14, /). A repre- 
sentative of the dorsal remotor is generally absent from the maxilla, 
but it is indicated in the diagram (fig. 19, J) because it is an impor- 
tant muscle of the mandible, and is sometimes retained in the maxil- 
lary musculature as a posterior rotator inserted on the cardo. The 
intrinsic muscles of the maxilla include the muscles of the endite 
lobes (lacinia and galea) and the muscles of the palpus, all of which 
take their origins within the stipes. The muscles of the lobes {flcs^ 
fga) never include antagonistic pairs of muscles; the palpus muscles, 
on the other hand, nearly always consist of a levator {0) and a 
depressor (^), corresponding with the muscles of the telopodite of 
a leg inserted on the base of the first trochanter (fig. 15, A, B, (9, Q). 
It will be shown in the following section how the mandibles and 
the second maxillae (labium) conform with, and depart from, the 
more generalized structure of a typical first maxilla. 

VII. THE BITING TYPE OF INSECT MOUTH PARTS 

When the gnathal appendages gave up their primitive function as 
organs of locomotion, and became transferred to the head in the 
capacity of organs accessory to ingestion, the mandibles, being closest 
to the mouth, were undoubtedly the first to undergo structural modi- 
fications in adaptation to their new duties. At first they probably 
served as mere prehensile or grasping appendages for obtaining the 
food and for passing it into the mouth; but in the Crustacea and 
Hexapoda they eventually evolved into strong biting and chewing 
jaws, and lost all semblance to their former leglike structure, except 
in the retention of the palpi in some of the crustaceans. The first 
maxillae, on the other hand, did not so completely lose their primi- 
tive form until, in some of the piercing and sucking insects, they 
became highly specialized as parts of an apparatus for feeding on 
liquid food. The second maxillae have had a more eventful history

in insects, because at an early evolutionary period they were united 
with each other forming the median, posterior appendicular organ 
of the head known as the labium, which has since undergone many 
special modifications in its structure. The labrum and the hypo- 
pharynx have been least affected in the evolution of the mouth parts, 
but even these organs in some of the piercing insects have suffered 
radical changes of form in compliance with special functions they 
have assumed. 

In the following descriptions there will be discussed only the 
fundamental modifications of the primitive mouth parts that have 
given these organs their typical structure in the so-called biting and 
chewing insects. 

TJie labrum. — The labrum in its typical form, as seen in the 
cricket (figs. 9 A, Ltn^ 21 A), is a broad flat lobe movable by a 
transverse line of flection on the lower edge of the clypeus. The 
muscles of the labrum take their origin on the frons. In general- 
ized insects there are two pairs of them, one pair (fig. 21 A) inserted 
anteriorly, the other posteriorly, on the labral base, the posterior 
pair being usually attached on small bars known as the tormae. 
In the cricket the anterior labral muscles are united into a single 
bundle of fibers. The posterior wall of the clypeus is often elevated 
in the form of a median lobe, of various shapes in different insects, 
called the efiiiharynx (fig. 4, Ephy). 

The mandibles. — The mandibles are the jaws of ordinary biting 
insects. Their primary structure as jaws is seen in some of the 
apterygote insects (fig. 2 B, Md)^ where they closely resemble the 
mandibles of the more generalized crustaceans, such as the pliyllo- 
pods (fig. 2 A, Md).^ and Anaspides (fig. 18 A). The insect mandi- 
bles differ from the crustacean mandibles in that they always lack 
palpi. 

A generalized mandible of the apterygote insect type of structure 
is an elongate organ, implanted by the broad inner surface of its 
base on the membranous latere ventral wall of the head (fig, 2 B, 
Md), to which it is hinged by a single dorsal point of articulation 
{a'). The jaw is moved by dorsal and ventral muscles. The dorsal 
muscles comprise two distinct fiber bundles arising on the dorsal 
wall of the head, one inserted anteriorly on the base of the mandi- 
ble (fig. 20 A, /), the other (/) posteriorly. These muscles, there- 
fore, are the primitive dorsal promotor and the dorsal remotor of 
the appendage (fig. 14, /, J.) , and probably serve to rotate the mandi- 
ble on its long axis. The ventral muscles, which are functionally 
adductors, usually comprise two groups of fibers (fig. 20 A, KL) 
arising within the hollow of the mandible. Those of one group 
{KLz) are attached on a median ligament (s), and the fibers from 



478 



ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 3 J 



the opposite jaws thus pull against each other, the whole structure 
forming a zygomatic mandibular adductor. Those of the other 
group {KLt) arise on a pair of sternal processes {HA)^ wliich are 
clearly the prototypes of the anterior tentorial arms of pterygote 
insects. The ventral muscles, considered as; a single functional 
group of fibers, evidently represent the ventral promotors and re- 
motors of a generalized limb (fig. 14, /f, Z), and hence are col- 
lectively designated KL^ as in Figures 18, 19, and 20. 

In the pterygote insects, and in some of the Apterygota, the man- 
dibles have a quite different type of mechanism from that character- 
istic of an apterygote mandible. Each jaw has a broad base, and, 
instead of a single dorsal point of articulation, it has a long hinge

line on the lower lateral margin of the cranium (fig. 12 A, Md) 
between strong anterior and posteinor articulations with the latter 
(fig.8,c,a'). The posterior articulation (fig.20B,«') represents the 
primary dorsal articulation (A a'). The anterior articulation (B, c) 
is a secondary one ; its acquisition limits the movement of the appen- 
dage to that of a hinge with a longitudinal axis {c-a^). By this 
change in the articulation of the mandible, the muscles assume al- 
tered functions. The primitive dorsal promotor (A, /) becomes 
a dorsal adductor (B, /), and the primitive remoter (A, /) 
becomes a dorsal adductor (B, /). The ventral adductor muscles 
are either greatly reduced or are entirely obliterated in the Ptery- 
gota. Remnants of them (B, KL) persist, however, in some of the 
more generalized pterygote insects, as in the mandibles of the cricket 
and some other Orthoptera, where the ventral adductors are repre-

adductor muscles are commonly very large and powerful (fig. 21 B,

Both dorsal muscles are generally inserted on apodemal stalks or 
plates, which are not attached directly to the mandibles, but arise 
from the articular membrane close to the edge of the mandible. 



480 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

TTie maxillae. — The first pair of maxillary appendages of insects 
are usually called " the maxillae," because the second pair are united 
in the labium. The maxillae in their typical form are the most 
leglike of the gnathal appendages. The usual structure of a maxilla 
of biting insects is well illustrated in the maxilla of the cricket, 
shown in Figure 21 C, which presents the posterior surface of a 
right appendage. The anterior wall is less complete, because the 
maxilla is broadly attached by most of the anterior surface of its 
basal part to the wall of the head. The basis of the appendage is 
divided into the proximal cardo {Gd) and the distal stipes {St). 
The stipes bears laterally the long palpus {Pip), and distally the 
two endite lobes, lacinia (Lc) and galea (Ga). A lobe of the stipes 
supporting the galea is sometimes distinguished as the suhgalea 
{sga), and a more or less differentiated lateral lobe bearing the 
palpus is known as the palpifer {Plf) . The cardo is usually divided 
externally by the line of a strong internal ridge, and the area of 
the stipes may also be marked by external grooves, or " sutures," 
that form internal strengthening ridges. 

The maxilla is always articulated to the hypostomal rim of the 
cranium by a single point of articulation (fig. 8, a") borne on the 
base of the cardo (fig. 21 C, a"). It thus preserves the primitive 
single 'articulation with the head, which corresponds with the primi- 
tive mandibular articulation (figs. 2 B, 20 A, a'), or with the pos- 
terior articulation of the mandible in pterygote insects (fig. 20 
B,a'). 

The musculature of the maxilla is so nearly identical with that 
described in the last section for a generalized gnathal appendage 
(fig. 19) that it need not be described in detail here. Usually there 
are only two maxillary muscles arising on the dorsal part of the 
cranium, both of which (/) apparently belong to the dorsal pro- 
motor system of a primitive appendage (fig. 14, /), though they 
are widely separated on the anterior margin of the maxillary base. 
One is inserted on the carclo (fig. 19 rfmxa), the other at the basal 
angle of the lacinia {fl^c) ; the latter functions, therefore, as a 
cranial flexor of the lacinia. The dorsal remotor {J) is usually 
lacking, but is sometimes present as a posterior muscle of the cardo. 
The ventral muscles {KLt) are powerful adductors. They take 
their origin on the tentorium, and are inserted within both the 
cardo and the stipes. The intrinsic muscles of the maxilla all arise 
within the stipes. They comprise a levator and depressor of the 
palpus (O, Q), a flexor of the galea {fffa), and a stipital flexor of 
the lacinia {flcs). 

The disposition of the maxillary muscles leaves little doubt that 
the cardo and stipes are but secondary subdivisions of the primitive 



THE INSECT HEAD SNODGRASS 



481 



basis of the appendage, and that they do not represent true limb 
segments, as some writers have supposed. The same conclusion, as 
we have seen, is even more strongly suggested by a study of the 
maxillae of the crustacean Anaspides (fig. 18, C, D, E) in which the 
cardo and stipes are clearly but differentiated parts of the basis, 
which in the maxilliped (fig. 17, LB) is an undivided segment. The 
origin of the palpus muscles (fig. 19, O^ Q) in the mesal part of 
the stipes and the origin of the galea muscle {fga) in the base of 
the stipes also leave no support for the idea, held by some writers, 
that the palpifer (fig. 21, C, Plf) is a segment of the appendage 
bearing the palpus and the galea. The two small basal segments 
of the palpus (fig. 19, Tr), therefore, belong to the trochanteral 
region of the telopodite. and the basal articulation of the proximal

The labiumn. — The labium is an insect specialty. Though a pair 
of head appendages ma}^ be united in some of the other groups of 
Arthropoda, the union has not produced an organ equal to that 
evolved from the second maxillae by the insects. While it is well 
known that the insect labium contains the second maxillary append- 
ages, it is not certain that it does not include also a part of the ven- 
tral wall of the labial segment of the head. There are, in fact, 
several reasons for believing that the proximal part of the labrum 
is a composite structure, consisting of the maxillary cardines and 
a median part of the labial sternum; but a discussion of these reasons 
can be better presented after describing the general structure of the 
labium. 



482 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

The labium in its simplest generalized form (fig. 22 A) is divided 
by a transverse suture, or line of flexibility {Ihs) , into two principal 
parts, one proximal, the other distal. The distal part has been 
termed the eulabium {Elb) by Crampton (1928). In a functional 
sense, at least, it is the " true " labium, i. e., the under lip of the 
insect, though it is perhaps not the entire second maxillae as Cramp- 
ton implied. The proximal, basal part of the labium may be called 
the hasilahium (Bib). The basilabium is generally not a free part 
of the labium, since it is usually implanted by most of its extent on 
the posterior ventral wall of the head, anterior to the neck. Its 
lateral basal angles («"'), however, are attached to the ventral 
margin of the cranium (fig. 3 A) just behind the posterior tentorial 
pits (pt) in line with the articulations of the maxillae {Mx) and the 
mandibles {Md). The body of the eulabium (fig. 22 A, Elh) hangs 
as a free flap from the distal edge of the basilabium. It bears all 
the appendicular parts of the labium, including a pair of lateral 
palpi (Pip), and four terminal lobes {Gl, ^9^)- The eulabium is 
sometimes deeply divided between the median pair of terminal lobes 
(fig. 23) , but the cleft never extends into the basilabium. 

The identities of the parts of the labium, as compared Avith the 
parts of a pair of united maxillae, can be established only by a study 
of the labial musculature. The principal internal muscles of the 
labium (fig. 22 A) consist of levators and depressors of the palpi 
((9, Q), flexors of the terminal lobes {fgl, fpgl)-, and retractors of 
the eulabium {rst). The muscles of the palpi and the terminal lobes 
take their origins within the body of the eulabium ; the retractors 
of the eulabium {rst) arise medially in the basilabium, and are 
inserted on the proximal margin of the eulabium. 

A comparison of the labial musculature (fig. 22 A) with that 
of a maxilla (B) shows at once that the body of the eulabium is 
the stipital region {St) of the united second maxillae. The body 
of the eulabium, therefore, is the pars stipitalis lahii, and is correctly 
named stipites lahialis, or lahiostipites. Lateral lobes of the labial 
stipites supporting the palpi (A, Pig) are equivalent to the palpifers 
of the maxillae (B, Plf)^ but are sometimes distinguished as pal- 
pigers {Pig). The terminal lobes of the labium are called glossae 
(A, Gl) and paraglossae {Pgl) ; they clearly correspond with the 
laciniae and galeae of a pair of maxillae (B, Zc, Ga) . Sometimes the 
two labial lobes on each side are united, sometimes the two median 
lobes are fused, or again all four may be unified in a single flap. 
The terminal lobes collectively constitute the ligula (fig. 24, Lig). 

The morphology of the basilabium is much more difficult to deter- 
mine than that of the eulabium. Some writers believe that the sus- 
pensory plate of the eulabium is the sternum of the labial segment. 



THE INSECT HEAD — SNODGRASS 483 

The attachment of the basilabium on the lower margin of the cranium 
by its basal angles in line with the cranial articulations of the 
maxillae and mandibles (fig. 3 A), however, would suggest that the 
basilabium contains the cardines of the second maxillae (fig. 22 B. 
Gd). On the other hand, the origin of retractor muscles of the 
labiostipites on the basilabium (figs. 22 A, 24, rst) makes it seem 
unlikely that the labial base is formed of the cardines alone, since 
there are never cardino-stipital muscles in the first maxillae ; but if 
the basilabium contains a median sternal element (fig. 22 B, stn)^ 
these muscles might be sterno-stipital muscles without objection. 
In the Dermaptera (fig. 25 A) a pair of large ventral muscles of the 
hypopharynx {inhv) also take their origin on the basilabium. 
Furthermore, the opening of the salivary duct, which originates in 
the embryo on the labial sternum between the bases of the second 
maxillae, is situated in generalized adult insects anterior to the base 
of the eulabium (fig. 4, SIO), and this fact suggests that the primi- 
tive labial sternum has been constricted between the approximated 
bases of the appendages while the salivary opening was crowded 
forward between the latter. Finally, the basal part of the labium 
is never divided medially, though the stipital region may be split 
almost completely into its lateral components. 

A concrete example indicating the composite nature of the basi- 
labium is seen in the labium of Machilis (fig. 23 A) : A pair of 
faintly marked but distinct lines converge distally in the basilabium, 
subdividing the latter according to the very pattern we might sup- 
pose would result from the fusion of the cardines with a posterior 
median part of the labial sternum (fig. 22 B). 

According to Holmgren (1909), the entire basal plate of the 
labium in termites, which is greatly elongate in the soldier caste 
(fig. 24 B, Bmt)^ is formed as a sclerotization of the neck membrane 
behind the bases of the second maxillary appendages, which latter 
move forward during the course of development. As to the fate of 
the cardines, Holmgren is uncertain, though he suggests that they 
perhaps are lost in the membrane between the eulabium and the basal 
plate. In the termite soldier the posterior tentorial pits are stretched 
out almost to the distal end of the basilabium, so that here the car- 
dinal parts of the labium must in any case be very small, but this 
condition does not pertain to the usual structure characteristic of 
most insects. 

While there can be little doubt that the labium is fundamentally 
a two-part structure, the sclerotization of its exposed posterior wall 
is seldom so simple and has been the cause of much confusion in 
labial nomenclature. The region of the basilabium may be entirely 
membranous or wholly sclerotized; its sclerotization may take the 
102992— S2 32 



484 



ANNUAL. REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 



form of one, two, or even three distinct plates. In the stipital 
region there may be two separate lateral sclerites, though generally 
most of the stipital area is covered by a single plate. 

When the basilabium contains two distinct plates (fig. 23 D), the 
distal one is generally termed the mentum (Mt), and the proximal

one the submentum {Smt) . The stipital sclerotization is then called 
the prementum {Pmt). Some entomologists, however, especially 
those studying insects having a single basal plate, give the name 
" mentum " to the stipital plate, and term the basal plate the " sub- 
mentum." This system, as Kadic (1902) and Walker (1931, 1931a) 
have shown, is the most logical nomenclature that can be applied 
to the labium, since it is based on the primitive structure retained 



THE INSECT HEAD SNODGRASS 485 

in such insects as Apterygota (fig. 23 A), Isoptera (B), Odonata, 
Diptera, the larvae of Lcpidoptera and Hymenoptera, and others. 
When there are two sclerites in the basal region Walker would dis- 
tinguish the proximal one as the 'pHmary suhmental plate^ and the 
distal one (" Vorderplatte " of Kadic) as the secondary suhmental 
plate. 

While agreeing in spirit, and in former usage (1928), with the 
plan of labial nomenclature advocated by Kadic and by Walker, 
the writer here follows the more common practise of giving the 
names " mentum " and " submentum " to the two principal plates 
that may be formed in the region of the basilabium. This usage, 
however, leaves us without an appropriate name for a primitive 
single sclerite occupying the basilabium, or for one that can not be 
certainly identified with either the submentum or the mentum. For 
a sclerite of this nature the term postmentum (fig. 23, B, Bmf) is 
suggested. It would appear in some cases that the mentum and 
submentum are differentiations from a primitive postmentum, and 
in others that the mentum is formed from the membranous anterior 
part of the basilabium. In any case, however, the mentum belongs 
to the sub-stipital region of the labium, since it always lies proximal 
to the insertions of the retractor muscles of the stipites (fig. 24, rst) 
inserted on the base of the prementum. The mentum in some insects 
evidently has suffered a secondary reduction, as in the Blattidae 
(fig. 23 C, Mt.) ; in the Acrididae it is practically obliterated. 

The complete musculature of the labium (fig. 24) comprises four 
groups of muscles. Those of the first group include two pairs of 
muscles arising typically on the tentorium, both of which are in- 
serted on the prementum, one pair proximally {ladlh), the other 
distally {^adlh). These muscles correspond with the tentorial ad- 
ductors of the first maxillae (fig 19, KLt). The second set of labial 
muscles includes the muscles of the palpi (fig. 24, Iplp, dv^P)-! ^^^^1 of 
the terminal lobes (/^?, fpgl)., all of which arise within the pre- 
mentum, and have their exact counterparts in the maxillae (fig. 19, 
O. Q, flcs, fga). The third group of labial muscles includes two 
pairs (fig. 24, Is^ 2s) arising within the prementum and inserted on 
or near the orifice of the salivary duct. These muscles are not rep- 
resented in the maxillae. The labial muscles of the fourth set are 
the stipital retractors (fig. 24, rst) arising medially on the basila- 
bium (always proximal to the mentum when the latter is present), 
and inserted on the extreme base of the prementum. These are im- 
portant muscles of the labium, but they have no representatives in 
the maxillae. 

Lastly, we must observe what happens to the labium in insects 
having a prognathous type of head (fig. 12 B), and particularly in 



486 



ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 



insects of this kind in which the posterior part of the head is 
elongate. 

A simple elongation of the posterior part of the head, unaccom- 
panied by structural changes in the cranium, has no other effect on 
the labium than a mere lengthening of the basilabial or submental 
region of the appendage. In many prognathous insects, however,

the elongation of the head has been accompanied by a forward 
migration of the posterior tentorial pits on the ventral head wall 
(figs. 12 B, 13, pt)^ with a consequent lengthening of the lower 
ends of the postoccipital suture {pos) behind the pits. In some 
cases, as in the soldiers of termites, the tentorial pits themselves 
become long, linear slits. In either case, the submental region of 
the labium is enlarged by an increment to its posterior part, found 
as an extension of its base, or gular area, lying proximal to the

tentorial pits. There is thus added to the submental region of the 
basilabium (fig. 13, Smt) a proximal area of varying extent known 
as the (jula {Gu). Though the gula is thus but an extension of 
the base of the primary submentum, the two areas of the basilabium 
separated hy an imaginary or real line hetimen the anterior ends 
of the tentorial pits are now distinguished as " submentum " and 
"gula" {Smt, Gu). It is clear that the evolutionary capacity of 
the labium can not be made to conform with the niceties of nomen- 
clatural consistency. In the Dermaptera (fig. 25 A) a gular plate 
(Gu) is distinctly separated from the large basilabial plate (Bmt), 
but there is no mentum present.

The necessity of studying the muscles for identifying the parts 
of the labium can not be overemphasized. The stipital region 
(prementum), as we have seen, is the part of the labium (fig. 24, Lst) 
that contains the muscles of the palpi and terminal lobes, and on 
which are inserted the cranial muscles of the labium. The retractors 
of the stipites {rst), when present, are always inserted on the base 
of the prementum, never on the mentum. A good example of the 
value of the muscles in determining the homologies of the labial 
parts is furnished by the adult May beetle {Phyllophaga) , in which 
the labium (fig, 25 B) at first sight appears to have no submentum, 
though a distinct gula {Gu) and mentum {Mt) are present. An 
examination of the inner surface of the labium, however, reveals 
the submentum in the form of a deep inflection {Smt) between the

mentum and the gula, with the retractor muscles (rst) of the

THE DEBT OF AGRICULTURE TO TROPICAL AMERICA^ 



By O. F. Cook 
Bureau of Plant Industry, United States Department of Agriculture 



[With 7 plates] 



The extent to which our present civilization has drawn upon the 
native agriculture of tropical America is seldom recognized and is 
little understood by the general public. A new consciousness and 
interest in civilization has developed in recent years from issues 
raised in the war period. It begins to be seen that the origin and 
growth of civilization should be studied primarily as a biological 
problem in order to gain a more practical understanding of the 
conditions and factors of human progress. 

Civilization is made possible by agriculture and the best prospect 
of understanding civilization is through the study of agriculture. A 
first step toward civilization was taken when plants were domesti- 
cated and a settled existence became possible. The conditions of 
agriculture are required, with people living as separate families upon 
the land, for the experience of successive generations to accumulate, 
and the arts of civilization to develop. A debt of appreciation is due 
to the prehistoric domesticators of food plants who opened the way 
of advancement for the race. A poet of humanity has enjoined such 
a sentiment upon us, that we " forget not the forgotten and unknown." 
The nations have enshrined their unknoAvn soldiers, but agriculture 
is a service no less than warfare. 

The natives of America were inferior to the European invaders in 
weapons and military equipment, but in the arts of agriculture they 
had attained a higher development than any of the European na- 
tions. Early accounts of Mexico and Peru reflect the amazement 
of the Spanish explorers at the extent and perfection of the native 
cultures. The modern traveler shares the same feeling when he 
examines the remains of the ancient systems and finds that the 
prehistoric people went far beyond our present conceptions of agri- 
cultural possibilities. Study of the ancient systems may enlarge 
our ideas of improvements that are possible in agriculture. The 
industrial and commercial accomplishments of our civilization have

492 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

overshadowed our normal and instinctive interest in the welfare of 
agriculture. No doubt we shall find that agriculture is as necessary 
to maintain an advanced civilization as it was for the primitive 
beginnings. 

The ancient Peruvians undoubtedly excelled us in the art of irriga- 
tion, and they went much further in reclamation of land. Not only 
were leveling and terracing done to lessen the slopes of hillsides, 
but also land was constructed even in places that could have had no 
natural soil, on precipitous slopes or in eroded stream beds. Sub- 
stantial retaining walls were built and the inclosed space was filled 
in, below with rubble work for drainage and above with ample 
layers of good soil, which still raise good crops every year, after 
centuries of continuous cultivation. In many of the valleys of the 
eastern Andes all of the cultivated lands are of artificial terrace 
construction. Rivers were straightened and mountains resurfaced 
as incidents of these extensive reclamations. The narrow terraces 
on the slopes of the mountains, of course, have been recognized as 
artificial, but the vastly more extensive construction of artificial 
lands in the bottoms of the valleys were overlooked by many trav- 
elers, as though the terrace walls supporting the different levels 
were mere fences between fields. The development of such inten- 
sive methods of agriculture must have required centuries or 
millenniums. 

DOMESTICATION OF AMERICAN PLANTS 

The many plants domesticated in America are an evidence of the 
high development of agriculture and of the vast periods of time tha 
must have been required. The Peruvian region is considered as the 
chief center of domestication. Between 70 and 80 different species 
appear to have been domesticated in pre-Spanish times, as indicated 
by native names and uses. The list includes numerous root and 
seed crops adapted to the different elevations, also fruits and vege- 
tables, potherbs, condiments, medicines, intoxicants, fish poisons, dye 
plants, fibers, and numerous ornamental plants. The ancient 
Peruvians had potatoes, beans, maize, cotton, peppers, peanuts, 
cassava, and sweetpotatoes ; also guavas, chirimoyas, avocados, 
tuberoses, marigolds, and many other fruits and flowers which are 
still entirely unknown in North America.^ 

Tobacco apparently was known to the ancient Peruvians, but was 
considered injurious. The chewing of coca leaves was a regular 
habit before the conquest, as it is at the present time, and an extensive 
culture of the coca shrub is still maintained in the eastern Andes. 

* A list of names of Peruvian domesticated plants was published in an article on 
" Peru as a Center of Domestication," Journ. Hered., February and March, 1925. 



DEBT OF AGRICULTUEE TO AMERICA COOK 493 

Potatoes from the high altitudes, preserved by freezing and drying, 
are still carried down the eastern valle3^s on the backs of llamas and 
exchanged for coca. Some of the high-altitude varieties of potatoes 
are too bitter to be eaten in the fresh state, but are suited for drying 
into chufios, as the mummified potatoes are called. 

The plant domestications apparently were more ancient in America 
than in the Old World. The lapse of time is indicated by the fact 
that several of the American cultivated plants are not known to 
exist in a wild state. Several have reached the condition of seed- 
lessness and some have lost even the tendency to produce flowers. 
Many of the high-altitude crops of Peru are specialized for particular 
conditions and have not been established in any other countries. 

The discovery and conquest of new continents beyond the Atlantic 
was an event that has overwhelmed and preoccupied the imagination 
of historians in recent centuries, but the plant treasures of the 
New World are still to be appreciated. Spain was in advance of 
other European countries at the time of discovery. The period 
of Arab rule in Spain had witnessed a revival or a reintroduction of 
many of the arts of agriculture, including irrigation, as developed in 
north Africa, Egypt, and Syria. Neither Spain nor the rest of 
Europe was able to form any conception of the importance of the 
new plant world of America. Only a few of our modern historic 
writers have perceived the significance of the discovery of a new 
economic flora in America as affording new materials of human 
advancement which the Western Hemisphere has contributed to the 
enrichment of our European civilization. Though only a partial 
utilization of the American cultivated plants has yet taken place, 
the entire world has profited and vastly increased its production by 
using plants that were domesticated in America. 

That we as north Europeans should continue to attach homeland 
sentiments to the plants that came to America with the first settlers 
is partly a misunderstanding of the past. Agriculture was not origi- 
nal with the northern races or even indigenous in Europe, as archeo- 
logical investigations have shown. The traditional Old-World 
cereals — barley, wheat, and rye — were not natives of any part of 
Europe, but of Asiatic origin. A long succession of primitive 
peoples have been traced in Europe, going back to the glacial periods, 
variously estimated from 20,000 to 100,000 years ago, but with no 
indications of agriculture before the so-called Neolithic people come 
into Europe, in the late prehistoric period, 6,000 to 10,000 years ago. 
Moreover, this invading race had passed the stage of first beginnings 
in agriculture, being proficient in irrigation, terracing, and mega- 
lithic stonework. The subsequent history of Europe was not marked 
by advances in agriculture, but rather by decline. In Greece, for 



494 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

example, archeologists are finding that agricultural improvements 
of the megalithic age were not maintained in the classic period. 

INTERCHANGE OF CROPS 

That the world had need of the American crop plants is shown by 
the wide distribution that many of them have attained in Europe, 
Asia, and Africa. Some are grown more extensively in the Old 
World than in America. The potato is the chief dependence of 
northern Europe, and maize is a staple food in parts of Spain, Italy, 
Hungary, and many other countries. Cassava has become the prin- 
cipal root crop in parts of tropical Africa and of the East Indies. 
An acre of cassava is said to yield " more nutritious matter than six 
times the same area under wheat." The manufacture of tapioca 
from cassava is now conducted in the East Indies as well as in 
Brazil. The sweet potato was distributed across the Pacific and is 
well-nigh universal in tropical and subtropical regions. The peanut 
or ground nut is grown commercially in Senegal and in several other 
districts of Africa and Asia. The principal production of cacao is 
in West Africa. The vanilla plant grows wild in Mexico, but most 
of the commercial vanilla comes from the French colonies. Sisal 
is grown in East Africa and in the Philippines. The Hevea rubber 
tree, a native of Brazil, is cultivated extensively in the East Indies. 
Quinine and cocaine are supplied from the East Indies, though the 
plants are native in Peru. 

Some of the Old World crops, on the other hand, are grown most 
extensively in America. Taking a plant to a new region may enable 
it to escape pests or diseases which tend to increase in long-established 
cultivations. The fungus which destroyed the coffee plantations of 
the East Indies has not reached America, where most of the world's 
supply of this beverage is now produced. Brazil is the great coffee 
country, though coffee is important also in Colombia, Venezuela, 
Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Haiti, and Puerto Rico. The 
largest commercial cultivations of bananas are in Central America 
and the West Indies, whence 63,530,000 bunches were imported into 
the United States in 1929. More sugar is grown in Cuba than in any 
other countrj^, in favorable seasons more than 5,000,000 tons being 
produced. Rice from Louisiana and California is shipped to tropi- 
cal America, Japan, and China. Our high-priced labor raises food 
for low-price countries. 

TROPICAL AGRICULTURE IN THE UNITED STATES 

Though we are not accustomed to think of the United States as a 
tropical country, three of our principal crops — maize, cotton, and 
tobacco — are treated in European textbooks as tropical cultures and 



DEBT OF AGRICULTURE TO AMERICA — COOK 495 

our extensive production places us quite definitely in the tropical 
categ^ory. Our summer climate is essentially tropical in providing 
sufficient heat for the maturity of these crops. The summer heat in 
Europe is not sufficient to mature maize regularly north of the Alps, 
and only a few localities in the south of Spain, Italy, and the Balkan 
peninsula are warm enough for cotton. The European production of 
cotton in 1929 totaled about 24,000 bales, while the southern coun- 
ties of Virginia produced 4G,000 bales. On this basis Virginia is more 
tropical than the south of Europe. 

The tropic of the geography passes below the southern tip of 
Florida, but is only a conventional imaginary line. A plant-life tropic 
would touch our east coast of North Carolina, follow the coast plain 
to Texas, and continue westward through southern Arizona and Cali- 
fornia. Botanists would not deny that countries with native palms 
should be reckoned as tropical. The southern palmetto extends to 
North Carolina ; two native palms are found in South Carolina and 
four in Georgia. Louisiana, Texas, Arizona, and California, and 
their endemic species of palms, Sahal louisiana, Inodres texana, 
Washingtonia arwonica, and Washingtonia fllifera. The palm flora 
of Florida, with more than a dozen native species, exceeds that of 
many countries crossed by the Equator, to say nothing of the coco- 
nuts in Florida, the dates in California, or the many ornamental 
palms which are suited to open-air cultivation. 

The southern part of Florida, below Bradenton and Fort Pierce, 
has frost protection for tropical perennials and tree crops, especially 
near the coast. Most of the native flora of southern Florida is 
essentially tropical, like that of the West Indies. Mangoes, avoca- 
dos, sapodillas, bananas, papayas, and coconuts, with many other 
palms and ornamental trees of distinctively tropical character, are 
in regular cultivation. Recently it has been learned that all of 
the more prominent rubber-producing trees, including the Hevea 
or Para rubber tree of Brazil, are able to thrive in southern Florida. 

MAIZE OUR PREPONDERANT CROP 

The native agriculture of America had an essential unity and 
continuity over both continents. From Canada in the north to 
Patagonia in the south maize was the principal human food. The 
local maize cultures were endlessly varied and differently combined 
with other crops, but maize was the chief reliance over most of the 
agricultural area. The native popidations of each district in trop- 
ical America usually have several varieties of starch corns, some 
for early and some for late planting, also pop corns and sweet corns, 
which often are closely adapted to the local conditions. 

Many varieties from tropical American countries have been 
brought to the United States and tested in different regrions. Under 



496 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

the new conditions the behavior of the variety may be completely 
changed and may become definitely abnormal. The large-grained 
Cuzco maize which grows in Peru as a rather small, productive 
plant 6 or 7 feet high, may grow in the United States to a height of 
16 feet, and usually fails to mature any seed. 

The general distribution of maize, as well as the local diversity 
of varieties and uses, affords further indications of the antiquity of 
agriculture in America, though several of the tropical root crops 
also are widely distributed. The general custom of grinding the 
maize kernels into paste after soaking in water may indicate a 
previous use of root crops, and especially of cassava. Cassava and 
other root crops have continued to be more important than maize 
in some of the humid lowlands, while in the very high altitudes 
in South America maize was supplemented by another series of root 
crops, which included the potato. 

Small tribes of wandering, nonagricultural people survived in 
several parts of the New World, subsisting on natural products, or 
by hunting and fishing. Most of the natives of America planted 
crops and lived permanently in the same districts, though usually 
they did not farm continuously on the same land. A new clearing, 
or milpa, was cut and burned each year, planted for one or two sea- 
sons, and then left to grow up in " bush " for several years. In 
many districts the milpa sj^stem had given place to permanent 
cultivation, with a maize crop grown every year. The large-grained 
Cuzco maize was the principal crop that was grown in the special- 
ized terrace agriculture of Peru. Likewise in Mexico and in Guate- 
mala all of the ancient specialized systems of agriculture were 
applied to the production of maize. 

Our preponderant cultivation of maize in the United States is in 
line with the traditions of ancient America. It is significant that in 
the United States the word " corn," the traditional name for the 
cereals of northern Europe, has been transferred in popular usage 
to the maize j^lant. Vastly more corn is planted than wheat. In 
1929 there was a total of 98,000,000 acres devoted to corn as against 
61,000,000 to wheat, the corn having an average yield of 26 bushels 
per acre and the wheat 13 bushels. The corn crop was more than 
three times the wheat crop in volume, and the value $2,000,000,000, 
more than double. Of cotton, 46,000,000 acres were planted, with a 
value of a billion and a quarter. Of potatoes 3,000,000 acres were 
grown, and of tobacco 2,000,000 acres. 

FOOD HABITS DIFFICULT TO CHANGE 

The growth of civilization that has occurred since the discovery of 
America would not have been possible if our European forefathers 
who settled in America had not found ready for their use a new series 



DEBT OF AGRICULTURE TO AMERICA COOK 497 

of domesticated plants specially adapted to the local conditions in 
America which were often very different from the conditions that 
the colonists had known in Europe. Tlie survival of the early 
colonists often depended acutely upon their readiness of adjustment 
to the new conditions, b}^ learning how to use and grow the new crops. 

Changes in food habits are notoriously difficult to make, as they 
generally are resisted by an immense and unconscious inertia. 
Under the compulsion of starvation the Pilgrim Fathers learned to 
use " Indian corn " in Massachusetts, but the French still insist that 
they would starve before eating it. That maize in various forms is 
relished and preferred to other grains by millions of Europeans who 
have settled in America would not induce the French to try it, even 
in wartime. Out of consideration for our allies, we were enjoined 
to eat maize and send wheat to France. We ate the maize and the 
French lost their chance of learning about it. 

Our own use of maize as human food still is more limited than it 
might be, and probably more limited than it should be. On account 
of their better keeping qualities, " flint corn " and other hard-texture 
maize varieties are preferred in the United States for feeding ani- 
mals, while for human consumption the soft " starch-corn " varieties 
are preferred. Many acceptable uses of maize current in the Tropics 
are not known in the United States. A native community in eastern 
Guatemala was supplied with hard maize from the United States in 
a famine season, but the imported grain made inferior tortillas and 
proved unwholesome. 

VALUABLE COTTONS FROM MEXICO 

The Upland cotton of the United States is identified in many text- 
books with an Asiatic species, Gossypium herhaceum^ which in 
reality is not cultivated in America. An early reference is found 
to seed coming from the Levant, but from the plant characters it is 
certain that the varieties now grown commercially in the United 
States are not related to Gossyyium herhaceum. Many Asiatic cot- 
tons have been planted experimentally in the United States and 
found to be much less productive than Upland varieties brought 
from tropical America. 

The westward extension of cotton culture in the United States was 
facilitated by a new type of Upland cotton that appeared in Texas 
near the middle of the last century and probably came from Mexico, 
although no contemporary record of that fact has yet been found. 
Several varieties are recognized, as Mebane, Lone Star, and Rowden, 
which are known collectively as Texas Big-Boll cottons. In view 
of the rapid and continued increase of production in Texas and adja- 
cent States, it may be estimated that the Texas Big-Boll cottons 



498 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

probably are contributing at least half of the cotton that is produced 
in the United States. The crops that have been raised from this 
type of cotton would have aggregate values of many billions of 
dollars. 

Other superior types of Upland cotton have come from Mexico 
and Guatemala in the present century. A cotton from the State of 
Durango in northern Mexico was grown successfully in many dis- 
tricts from southern Virginia to the irrigated valleys of southern 
California, and later was replaced by the Acala cotton, another 
Mexican variety which is well adapted to conditions of production 
over a large part of the American Cotton Belt. The native cottons 
of Guatemala and southern Mexico were studied for several seasons, 
beginning in 1902, by expeditions sent out by the United States 
Department of Agriculture to learn the possibilities of production 
in the presence of the boll weevil. In the summer of 1906 a cotton 
expedition crossed Guatemala from the east by way of Panzos, 
Purulha, Salama, Rabinal, Quiche, Totonicapan, Quezaltenango. 
and Huehuetenango, passed the Mexican border at Nenton, and 
traversed the State of Chiapas through Comitan, Ocosingo, and Salto 
de Agua. The existence of a superior type of cotton was recognized 
at Ocosingo, and in December of the same year another expedition 
to southern Mexico obtained a supply of seed at a town called Acala. 
A select stock bred from this seed has been grown extensively in 
recent years both in the United States and in Mexico. Most of the 
cotton of the irrigated valleys of the Southwestern States is of this 
Acala variety, and several advantages over the Texas Big-Boll cot- 
tons have been shown. The plants are of more erect habit, with more 
open foliage and greater resistance to adverse conditions. Larger 
crops of bolls can be set in shorter periods, and the fiber quality is 
superior. Eventually the Acala cotton may be used as extensively 
as the Texas Big-Boll cottons, if adequate supplies of pure seed can 
be established and maintained. 

DOMESTICATION OF QUININE AND RUBBER 

Two important domestications of South American plants were 
accomplished in the last century and may be credited to the scientific 
interest and initiative of one man — Sir Clements Markham. Fore- 
seeing that the natural supplies of quinine and rubber would soon 
be inadequate, a systematic project for agricultural production of 
both commodities was undertaken and, after many vicissitudes, 
accomplished. 

Markham and his assistants explored the forests of the eastern 
Andes in Peru and Ecuador and carried many kinds of Cinchona 



DEBT OF AGRICULTURE TO AMERICA — COOK 499 

trees to British India. Other experiments were made in the Dutch 
colonies, and the present commercial production of quinine is in Java. 
Following the introduction of the Cinchona into other parts of the 
world, botanists were sent to tropical America for seeds of the differ- 
ent rubber trees. Repeated efforts were made to obtain Hevea seeds 
from Brazil, and a large shipment reached England in the summer 
of 1876. The seedlings were forwarded promptly from the Kew 
Gardens to Ceylon and Singapore, but commercial planting did not 
begin till 1896, after a practical system of tapping had been dis- 
covered. 

Sanitary control of malaria may have rendered the quinine 
domestication less significant than it was at first, but cultivated 
rubber has mounted rapidly to first-rank importance, both indus- 
trially and commercially. Not only have the producing districts 
in the British and Dutch colonies been transformed, but life in all 
civilized countries has been profoundly changed through the use 
of rubber in motor vehicles. The world was waiting to ride on 
rubber, and in a few years has become thoroughly addicted to the 
pleasure and convenience of rubber transportation. From an inci- 
dental status as a water-proofing material half a century ago, rubber 
has become the largest of our imports, and is recognized as an in- 
dispensable material of our present civilization. The imports of 
crude rubber into the United States during 1929 reached a total 
of 563,812 tons, with a value of approximately $240,966,780. Also 
motor vehicles are the largest of our exports, with the single ex- 
ception of cotton. 

OUR TROPICAL HERITAGE 

Our acute dependence upon rubber may work a change in our 
traditional neglect of the tropical aspects of our national economy. 
Perhaps from excess of European patriotism we have refused to 
recognize our tropical status and interest in tropical possibilities. 
Little inclination has been shown in the past to consider that our 
agricultural production is on a different footing from that of Euro- 
pean nations. They see us as a tropical country, but we refuse to 
consider ourselves in that capacity. Vast territories remain un- 
utilized in our Southern and Southwestern States, awaiting more 
suitable crops which probably must come from the tropics. Tem- 
perate crops from Europe have been tried persistently since the first 
settlements were made, but are restricted to winter growth, while 
all of the crops that are grown in the summer are of tropical origin. 

The industrial expansion of some of the European nations in the 
last century made them customers for wheat or other European 
102992—32 33 



500 ANNUAL BEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

crops that could be grown in the United States. The importance of 
home production of food in Europe, however, is now being recog- 
nized; one result of this will be a more careful consideration in 
America of a home market for food products. The time may soon 
come when we shall be willing to lay aside our remaining European 
prepossessions and face the necessity of making the most of our own 
country. With this viewpoint we shall cooperate more construc- 
tively with our American neighbors who are facing the same prob- 
lems of utilizing tropical plants as the basis of economic and social 
advancement. 

Neglect of such considerations is responsible for the present situa- 
tion in the United States in regard to rubber, which undoubtedly 
could be produced as well or better in tropical America than in the 
East Indies. The history of the rubber development shows that 
much has depended on mere accident, through lack of interest. The 
accident whereby American rubber companies began with a different 
tree in Mexico resulted in discouragement at a critical stage when 
the East Indian plantations were beginning to be successful, so that 
valuable time has been lost. It was supposed that the world's need 
of rubber would soon be supplied, and this mistake is now being 
repeated. 

The discovery of a suitable tapping method for the Hevea tree 
in the East Indies also was accidental, except that the conditions 
for making such a discovery had been provided b.y the introduction 
of the tree. If the tapping method for Hevea had not been dis- 
covered, the cultivation of Castilla in Mexico and Central America 
would not have appeared as a complete failure. The rubber prob- 
lems have been studied but little as yet, and practical ways of 
utilizing the Castilla tree or other rubber-producing plants may 
still be found. Mechanical extraction of rubber instead of the 
laborious tapping operation is the line of improvement to be ex- 
pected, but different extraction processes, as well as different cul- 
tural methods, will probably have to be developed for each of the 
producing species. 

The lesson is that in each country stocks of the different kinds 
of rubber trees or other useful plants should be available to furnish 
ample supplies of seed or propagating material for those who are 
interested in determining the possibilities of the new plants. The 
history of rubber affords many illustrations of the general require- 
ment for progress in agriculture— namely, that the facts must be 
learned by actual experience and familiarity with the plants. There 
is no way to prophesy in advance that a plant will not grow in a 
new country, or that new uses will not be discovered. Nobody 
would have guessed that the Hevea tree would thrive in Florida or 



DEBT OF AGRICULTURE TO AMERICA COOK 501 

that it would be less susceptible to cold than the Castilla tree, but 
such are the facts. Though the seedlings of the Hevea tree often 
require shade and wind protection, the range of possible cultivation 
is much wider than has been supposed and undoubtedly extends 
through the West Indies, Central America, and Mexico. 

There is no apparent reason why the Hevea tree should not be a 
regular farm asset in many countries of tropical America. Only the 
lack of knowledge and the absence of the plant material can explain 
the absence of a rubber industry in tropical regions of farm produc- 
tion. Few crops can be handled with simpler tools or less machin- 
ery. The native farmers of the East Indies are now producing 
rubber to better advantage than the owners of large plantations. 
The use of motor transportation is extending in the Tropics, and 
the countries that can produce rubber should seek to supply their 
own needs. 

The tropical world is rapidly becoming accessible to civiliza- 
tion, and even greater transformations may be expected than have 
occurred in temperate regions. Rubber gives us new powers that 
are producing magical changes in human life, in all civilized coun- 
tries. A century ago the experiments of Hancock and Goodyear 
were being made, which opened the period of industrial invention 
and exploitation of rubber. Sixty years later the tropical forests 
of both hemispheres had been ravaged of their wild rubber. Only 
three decades have elapsed since plantation rubber began to be 
available in practical quantities. No other event in history has 
changed the world so rapidly as the domestication of the Brazilian 
rubber tree.

SOME WILD FLOWERS FROM SWISS MEADOWS AND 

MOUNTAINS 



By Casey A. Wood 



[With 6 plates] 



The north slopes of the Lake of Lucerne form an important area 
of the Four Forest Cantons. There nature seems to have arranged 
them especially for an exuberant growth of Alpine and sub-Alpine 
wild flowers. This charming locality with its southern exposure is 
protected from cold winds by the surrounding hills, while rainfall 
and sunshine are justly proportioned to stimulate the growth of 
foliage and bloom from the meadow flowers on the lake margins to 
the pines and snow plants of the Rigi-Kulm, 6,000 feet above it. 

After a winter in Rome we arrived at Vitznau, 10 miles from 
Lucerne, at the end of April to witness the unfolding of a second 
semitropical spring. The Park Hotel, surrounded by what is virtu- 
ally a small botanical garden of 5 acres, furnished the trees and 
plants — oleanders, magnolias, wisterias, roses, forsythias, weigelias, 
hydrangeas, judas trees, spiraeas, azaleas, flowering chestnuts, etc. — 
that had passed their bloom when we left the Eternal City, but once 
more opened in all their belated charm and gloiy to give us a hos- 
pitable Swiss greeting. 

It was not, however, to the official gardener and his assistants that 
we turned for botanical information, but to the lovely hills and 
high mountains that walled us in on the north and spread before 
us in seductive vistas — snow-capped some of them, verdure-clad all 
of them — to the far south. We organized walking expeditions, 
steamer excursions, and motor trips to explore this naturalist's par- 
adise. Even the feeblest climber of our party finally did a 6-mile 
hike over the hills and far away to a Swiss hamlet near the snows, 
passing through indescribably beautiful Alpine meadows and green 
pastures carpeted with wild flowers. On these walking tours (and 
Baedecker was undoubtedly right when he said that the only way 
really to see a coimtry is to tramp through it) we had ample op- 
portunity to admire the cleanly, effective, and artistic fashion in 
which the Swiss people have regulated, adapted, and improved even 

503

the smallest village and its surroundings with an eye to their chief 
source of income — the tourist traffic. Their hotels are the best in 
the world; even off the beaten path of travel one is sure to find a 
warm welcome in some well kept, clean, and reasonably cheap inn 
or pension. 

The abundant rainfall of the Forest Cantons and the melting 
snows not only supply tlie moisture needed for a luxuriant vegeta- 
tion, but they furnish in the shape of waterfalls delightful attrac- 
tions to the Alpine scenery. The falls vary in size from the tiny 
but decorative tricklings that are wholly dependent for existence 
on intermittent rains to the more or less permanent cataracts largely 
fed by the eternal snows. More than that, water power is a valua- 
able asset. One of its numberless local uses is its cheap and uni- 
versal employment in electrically lighting the whole country, the 
surplus j^ower being sold to neighboring countries. 

One must not forget the birds in this brief account of the glories 
of the Forest Cantonal scenery. The notes of the cuckoo, the black- 
bird, the song sparrow, the nightingale, and other songsters are heard 
in this delectable land. One might, on a tramp over sub-Alpine 
hills and valleys, recall Marlowe's lines: 

Shallow rivers to whose falls 
Melodious birds sing madrigals. 

Over a hundred years ago Prince Charles Lucien Bonaparte, one 
of our foremost authorities on American ornithology, wrote for an 
Italian journal a comparative account ^ of the birds of Rome and 
Philadelphia, in which he showed that although many of the 247 
species observed in the former metropolis differ in some respects 
from 281 avian visitors to the American city, there are in numerous 
instances few external characters to distinguish the Old World from 
the New World birds. Much the same experience has characterized 
the present writer's desultory adventures with Alpine flora and 
fauna, since the differences between the floAvers and birds of, let us 
say, California and the Forest Cantons, are not, after all, so very 
great. 

In the present paper it is proposed to emphasize the differences 
and similarities of some Swiss species of wild flowers not unfamiliar 
to Americans, and it may be said at the outset that one suffers from 
an einbarras de Hchesse in such a study because, as many botanical 
authorities have noted, no country in the world can produce in a 
similar limited area as many species of indigenous plants as the 
two cantons of Schwyz and Lucerne. Stuart Thompson, for ex- 
ample, has estimated that, excluding varieties and subspecies, there 

* Spocchio comparativo della oniitologia di Roma e di Filadolfia. Nuova Gior- 
nale dei Letterati, 1827. 



SWISS WILD FLOWERS WOOD 505 

are at least 2,540 species of wild ferns and flowering plants in 
Switzerland, and it is not claiming too much for the mountains 
and valleys of the Forest Cantons to say that they possess about 
2,000 indigenous species. 

The greatest variety and most brilliant display of these blooms 
are found from April to November in the Swiss meadows and 
pastures, a cultivated acre or two wrested here and there from the 
forest and rocks of a stern and mountainous land. It is when and 
where the peasant farmer waits for the development of his biennial 
crops of grass, hay, and other fodder — that is to say, anywhere from 
the margin of the lake to the pines that grow almost to the line of 
perpetual snow— that these small but brilliantly green oases of 
cultivated land are to be searched for wild flowers. A mountain 
meadow in May is a joy lost to the traveler who sees only the more 
widely advertised and monumental sights of Switzerland. 

Hoffmann strikes the correct note when he remarks that the serious 
student of Swiss wild flowers soon realizes that besides the classic 
Alpenrosen and Edelweiss there are many other species of wild 
flowers " that find their home only in the Swiss mountains, where 
their blossoms sometimes stand so close together as practically to 
form a covering for pastures, meadows, and rocks. Such floral 
carpets, quite characteristic of the landscape, fascinate by their 
brilliant coloring even the eyes of those who take but a moderate 
interest in the more scattered flora of their own native land." (PI. 1.) 

Imagine, then, a relatively small patch of cultivated hillside 1,000 
to 8,000 feet above sea level on which, throughout most of the spring 
and summer, grow blooming masses of centaurea (especially G. 
montana), vetches, rampion {Phyteuma spicatum and P. orhicu- 
lare, both purple and white), eglantine, gentian (4 varieties), 
wild geranium (4 varieties near Vitznau), lilies, violas, columbine, 
saxifrage, blue bells, globe flowers, pinks {Dianthus superhits), cycla- 
men, eyebright, nettles, fragrant cow-parsley, shasta-like daisies (and 
their first cousins, the Alpine chrysanthemums), arnica, primroses, 
monkshood, Alpine meadow rue, speedwell (interspersed Avith many- 
hued clovers and ornamental grasses), scabiosa, catchfly {Silene 
in-flata) both mauve and white-flowered forms, Alpine balsam 
{Er'tnus alpinus), groundsel {Senecio do7'onicuj7i) , soapwort {Sapo- 
naria ocymoides)^ milkwort {Poly gala alpestris), sainfoin {Onohry- 
chis Tnontana), cotton grass {EriophoinLm angiostifoUmn), plantains, 
St. Bernard's lily {Anthericum liliago), blue chicory (rarely the 
flowers are white), yellow and white ranunculus, mustard, pink 
bistort, hawkweed, alpenrosen {Rhododendron) , and dozens of other 
flowering j^lants of which our limited space does not permit even 
the bare mention. 



506 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONUN INSTITUTION, 1931 

Perhaps also, especially during the first weeks of spring, one may- 
be lucky enough to come in the higher hills upon a field whose center 
is occupied by a melting snowbank or ice layer, a hundred or more 
feet across, whose periphery is aglow with flourishing groups of 
soldanella, oxlip, silver thistle, hepatica, crocuses, blue snow gentians, 
primroses (among them Primula auricula) , the Mediterranean heath 
{EHca camea), butterwort {Pinguicula alpina), spring columbine, 
violets, for-get-me-not {Myosotis alpestris), buttercups {Ranunculus 
glacialis), and other early flowers, mixed with still earlier grasses 
and small shrubs. The present writer has on several occasions 
picked bunches of many-colored flowers on the margins of a neve 
whose ice-cold water warmed in the sun became a fit stimulant and 
food solvent for the surrounding vegetation. 

In the protected Alpine woods a somewhat different flower exhibit 
is held. Here, for example, most of the Swiss orchids are found, 
more than 20 species in the Forest Cantons, a remarkable showing 
when contrasted with the few species found in the whole of North 
America. Then again, harebells, wood geranium, rockrose {Eelian- 
themum vulgare), St. Johnswort {Hypericum maeulatum)^ cinque- 
foils {Potenfilla aurea and P. argentea)^ Prenanthes purpurea^ chick- 
weed {Gerastium arvense), willow-herb {Epilohrium angustifo- 
lium), Moehringia muscosa, Digitalis amhigua, valerian {Valeriana 
tryptens)^ adenostyles alpina, several mints (among them Mentha 
sylvestris) ^ Turkscap lily {Liliu/?n martagon) , broom {Genista tinc- 
tona), rockcress {Arahis alpina), clematis, honeysuckle, chicory, 
woodbine, cowslips, and many other shade and water loving j^lants 
flourish along the banks of the mountain rills, together with a multi- 
tude of lovely ferns, mosses, and rock plants. 

Speaking of the last named, the geologic formations of the Swiss 
mountains, especially the glacial and other sedimentary rocks, form 
admirable backgrounds for rock gardens, and here rather than in 
artificial creations, however extensive and well kept, are to be found 
the most wonderful of these peculiarly attractive examples of flori- 
culture. Scattered over and almost covering some of the " pudding- 
stone " areas (glacial moraines) of the Forest Cantons may be seen 
many a flourishing wild " garden " that puts to shame both in variety 
and quantity of bloom the vaunted and carefully cultivated imita- 
tions to be found in our botanical parks. 

From the foregoing will be readily imagined the difficulty at- 
tendant upon an attempt to describe in anything like detail the 
hundreds of wild species that flourish in the meadows, pastures, 
forests, valleys, and rugged mountains of the cantons bordering on 
the Lake of Lucerne. Even when one confines oneself, as in this 
short paper, to the indigenous flowers of the two cantons, Schwyz 



SWISS WILD FLOWERS — WOOD 507 

and Lucerne, an apology is due to the reader for this scant treatment 
of the theme. However, the following are a few of the most attrac- 
tive plants the writer has seen in his rambles about the Vicrwald- 
stattersee. 

Edelweiss, the "noble white" or, to give its high-sounding but 
cacophonic systematic name, Gna'pKalium leontofodium^ is popu- 
larly supposed to be a denizen of only the high Alps, but although 
it is now found only in wild and secluded mountain areas, usually 
about 10,000 feet above sea level, this is in part the result of the 
ruthless fashion in which it has been plucked by the root for the 
past century by careless or unscrupulous tourists and flower sellers. 
Throughout Switzerland, as a protection against complete extinc- 
tion of this plant, the taking of the root is forbidden by law. More- 
over, as a further preventive of the eradication of this pretty plant, 
its cultivation at low levels as a garden flower is almost universal 
throughout the Confederation. For many years the edelweiss flour- 
ished in a famous Alpine garden conducted by Herr Stierlin, a 
well-known hotel proprietor, on the Kigi-Scheidegg. Since the 
World War this garden has, unfortunately, been abandoned. How- 
ever, the flowers are successfully cultivated in a private garden at 
Gersau, on the Lake of Lucerne, Canton Schwyz, where the size of the 
plant has much increased and the colors of the flowers have greatly 
improved under domestic care. It is now well understood that the 
plants may be raised from seed, and Stuart Thompson notes that 
it has grown well and flowered profusely on the top of a house 
in the center of London (pi. 3). 

Taking it all in all, the most interesting flower that blooms in 
Alpine heights is the blue Soldanella alpina L. There are four 
species of this genus, at least one variety of which, the blue moon- 
wort, has been grown at low levels and naturalized in foreign 
gardens. We are indebted to that charming writer. Grant Allen, 
for one of the best descriptions of this wonderful species and of 
its ice-boring qualities. The appearance of the crocus and other 
early flowering plants as they push their way through the snow 
is always a source of joy and wonder to the lover of spring flowers, 
but the activities of a plant that actually drills a passage to air 
and sunshine through several inches of solid ice is not observed by 
every naturalist. 

Li the autumn the soldanella develops thick, leathery leaves, well 
provided with fuel (starch, protoplasm) for the coming winter. 
These lie flat upon the ground (see fig. 1) expectant of the snow 
and ice sheet that may cover them to a depth of several feet. When 
the spring arrives and the hot sun melts most of the snow and some 



508 



ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 



of the ice, water trickles down to the rootlets and arouses growth 
in the sleeping plant. Internal combustion ensues within the floral 




Figure 1. — The autumn leaves of Suldanella alpina — the plant that 
melts ice and snow 

tissues. The resulting heat melts the ice about the uprising flower 
buds, and the stem pushes its way upward. More water flows to 
the roots; increased activity is induced, and finally, after several 

setbacks or " regelations " — as Tyn- 
dall calls them — the plant, espe- 
cially if its race is run along the 
margin of the ice sheet, soon tunnels 
a passage to the air and sunshine. 

So long as the heat given oti' 
from the growing stem and buds 
is sufficient to prevent actual solid 
freezing of the parts, tlie soldanella 
is indifferent to the surrounding 
ice-cold temperature; it under- 
goes the usual transformations, 
is fertilized by early bees, and 
forms many hundreds of wonder- 
ful blue flower groups that crowd 
the margins of the neve, some of 
which look for all the world as 
if they were beds of bloom actually 
rooted in and growing out of a 
thick layer of transparent ice. 
If one now examines the leaves of the plant it will be noticed 
that they are no longer thick and fleshy, but are thin and papery;

they have yielded up their carbon compounds as fuel to melt a 
tunnel in the ice, and the production of the buds and blossoms on 
the flower stem above the ice mantle. The illustrations (figs. 1, 2, 
and 3) attempt to show the progress of the flower stalk from the 
autumn leaf beds to the full development of the flowering plant 
the following spring. (See also pi. 2, fig. 1.) 

The Swiss Orchidaceae have already been mentioned, but their 
number and the beauty of their blooms call for special reference. 
Man}^ have fragrant flowers, beautifully colored, wdth fantastically 
shaped separate flowers or flowerlets borne on long spikes. They

(After Grant Allen.) 

are commonly found at middle and high altitudes. The great 
majority of Alpine orchids are also native elsewhere — in Europe, 
Asia, and America. 

These highly valued plants are generally thought to be difficult 
of cultivation, and it is true that some of them do not readily bloom 
after transplantation. All of them require a deep planting, many 
in a limestone soil mixed with peat. They should never be moved 
except in the late autumn after flowering and plant grow^th have 
ceased. A few of the most interesting are as follows : 

The green- winged orchid {Orchis morio) has four color varieties — 
mauve, purple, pink, and white. They have erect stems G to 8 
inches high, and the flowers are disposed in a handsome, loosely 



510 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

arranged spike, the sepals curiously arched like a helmet. The 
morio is among the most attractive of the native orchids. It is 
well known also as an English species, and at least six others of this 
attractive genus are found in the British Isles, 

Of the genus Gymnadenia^ the species odoratissima^ 4 to 10 inches 
high, presents mauve flowers on a long spike that have a pleasant 
odor. 

Nigritella angustifolia is found throughout Europe. It is 3 to 8 
inches in height and carries its small dark carmine flowers as a 
crowded spike. It is found in upland Swiss pastures from 5,000 to 
8,000 feet above sea level. It is called the vanilla orchid, and has a 
pronounced odor of that bean. 

Cypripediuin is a genus well known to Americans as ladyslipper, 
The Swiss species {G. calceolus) closely resembles our own plants. 
It is found at low levels, not being strictly Alpine. As is well 
known, species of this beautiful genus are found all over the world 
(pi. 6). 

The charming butterfly orchids {Platanthera hifolia and chlor- 
antha) are also widely distributed. Their stemiS are 12 to 30 inches 
high; the flowers are white to whitish green, arising loosely in a 
3 to 6 inch spike, and they are both fragrant. 

An orchid that grows on mossy banks and mountain pastures up 
to 4,000 feet is HerTniniuni monorchism called from its pronounced 
odor, the musk orchid. It has a pretty " flower," a slender spike 
with numerous small, yellow-green blooms. 

A curious sub-Alpine plant, found in shady woods up to 4,500 
feet — at Engelberg, for example — is the birdnest orchid {Neottia 
nidus-avis L.) The stem is 12 inches high, with loose scales taking 
the place of leaves. Two or three pale-brown flowers are borne on 
a 4-inch spike. Its name derives from the dense mass of fibers con- 
stituting the root system. 

A very pretty orchid, also found throughout Europe, is Limo- 
dorum dbortivum. The whole plant (12 to 24 inches high, including 
the large flowers) is violet in color. It is commonly found in pine 
woods. 

The smallest European orchid is \Qvy rarely seen above Lucerne. 
This is the bog orchid {Malaxis paludosa). The flowers arc insig- 
nificant, and the plant is difficult to find in the peat bogs where it 
grows. 

A very handsome genus with many species, found in the Forest 
Cantons, is Cephalanthera. C. rubra (red helleborine) may grow 
to a height of 20 inches, supporting its bright pink flowers in a loose 
spike. This fine plant prefers the shelter of woods and thickets, 
growing in a limestone soil. A pure white variety (or perhaps dis- 



SWISS WILD FLOWERS — WOOD 511 

tinct species) closely resembles the foregoing. Another Swiss spe- 
cies of this genus is the charming G. latifolia, 12 to 20 inches high, 
whose flow^ers are cream colored and are found in June on sub-Alpine 
wooded hills. 

Finally, to mention another orchid genus represented in North 
America, is Epipactis. The 10 Swiss species are rather tall plants 
with leafy stems bearing brown, purple, or greenish-white flowers, 
occasionally tinged with red, in a loose raceme. In E. pahcstris the 
white, green, orange, and purple flowers are large and very beautiful. 
The smooth stem is about a foot high, and the plant prefers marshes 
and watered meadows reaching 4,000 feet above the sea. 

The crocus — that harbinger of spring — is represented in Swiss up- 
land pastures and snow fields (to 7,000 feet) by the very pretty C. 
vernus. The white or violet flowers open before or with the coming 
of the grasslike leaves, and sometimes appear (April to June, accord- 
ing to elevation and situation) surrounded by the, as yet, unmelted 
snow. 

Seven other wild species of the iris family are known in Switzer- 
land, all capable of domestication in gardens and at low levels. 

Primula elatior, the oxlip, resembles P. veris, the familiar cowslip, 
only it is more erect than the latter, has larger and longer leaves, and 
its many-flowered umbel is straw-colored and larger than the cow- 
slip bloom. It is not scented. This early plant is common from 
April to July in meadows, woods, and pastures up to 7,000 feet 
(pi. 2, fig. 2). 

Anemone sulphurea, with a stem 6 to 18 inches high, bearing a 
large, solitary yellow-white flower (pi. 4), is by some regarded 
as a variety of A. alpina^ which it closely resembles, although the 
latter has a white flower tinged with blue below. Both have ternate, 
bipinnatifid root-leaves with deeply cut segments. These species 
affect pastures and rough ground on Alpine slopes, and bloom from 
May to July. 

Monkshood {Aconitum napeUus) : There are several Swiss aco- 
nites, but this species is the commonest about the Vierwaldstiittersee. 

It has a striking resemblance to the delphiniums of our gardens 
and is equally capable of cultivation and improvement in color and 
size. Perhaps its violent poisonous qualities act somewhat as a 
deterrent in that direction. In our own American gardens it ap- 
pears as a beautiful plant with dark violet (occasionally purple, light 
blue, or white) flowers borne in a simple, cylindrical raceme. The 
plant loves upland woods, damp meadows, the margins of a small 
stream, or the vicinity of a herdsman's hut, in return for whose shade 
it provides the decoration of its charming flowers. It blooms from 
June to August between 3,000 and 8,000 feet above sea level (pi. 5). 



512 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

That immense family Ranunculaceae is so largely represented 
about the Lake of Lucerne that all the allotted space for this paper 
might easily be filled with the briefest sketch of its pretty Swiss 
species. One of these is Clematis alpina, that fine creeping shrub 
with large, solitary violet flowers borne on long stalks. It loves 
stony, wooded uplands 2,000 to 7,000 feet above the sea. The flowers 
persist for a long time in shady nooks from June to August, and the 
plant has a pleasing habit of covering the rugged limestone rocks 
among which it grows with its present leaves and last year's tendrils. 

Of the numerous Swiss anemones, A. hepatica^ as described in 
Flemwell's "Alpine Flowers and Gardens," reminds one of our own 
spring flower, the earliest of the year. "As the snow recedes," says 
he, " the brown bed of the pine forests (around Bex in the Rhone 
valley) is decked with myriads of Hepatica; their thick clusters of 
mauve-blue flowers, relieved here and there by the rarer forms of 
white and rose, . . . creating a veritable laughing fairyland where, 
usually, all is sedate if not gloomy." 

The gentians : The Forest Cantons have their proper share of this 
world family. There are fully 20 species of the genus found in 
Switzerland, most of them about the Lake of Lucerne. The flowers 
of the gentians are usually a deep blue, but in some species are 
mauve, yellow, purple, or nearly white. Though they are generally 
solitary on the flower stalk, yet they also occur in terminal cymes. 
Both corolla and calyx are distinctly tubular and often angled. 
The accompanying figure (pi. 3) shows Gentiana acaulis, the stem- 
less gentian. Although in this species the flower stem is very short, 
it is not absent, as Linnaeus pointed out in his description of the type 
specimen now in the Linnaean Herbarium at Burlington House, 
London. The corolla is 1 to li/^ inches long and is deep blue, with 
greenish (rarely) white or mauve streaks. This beautiful plant 
grows in grassy Alpine pastures and meadows up to 8,500 feet. 
Its association with the edelweiss in the illustration (pi. 3) is car- 
ried out in bouquets sold to tourists where the one flower is a foil 
to the other — both supposed to have been gathered well up to the 
snow line. 

Gentiana nivalis must also be mentioned, as it is the species that 
from June to September shows its small blue or mauve flowers at 
great elevations (5,000 to 10,000 feet) and opens them only when 
the sun shines brightly. It is a small plant, 1 to 6 inches high. 

Fringed gentian {Gentiana ciliata) : This beautiful species has 
been justly celebrated in verse and prose. It is a hardy biennial or 
perennial, with a stem 3 to 10 inches high, carrying large, handsome, 
pale (electric) blue flowers with a strongly divided corolla, whose 
margins are strongly " fringed " or ciliated. The flowers are often 
solitary, or there may be several to the stalk. This lovely plant 



SWISS WILD FLOWERS WOOD 513 

blooms from August to October, being distinctly an autumnal 
species. It prefers Alpine pastures and hillsides up to 8,000 feet, 
and is especially fond of shade and a soil of limestone detritus. 

Few subjects in local natural history have produced a more exten- 
sive literature, in English, French, and German, both popular and 
systematic, than Alpine plant life. Both the tourist and the ama- 
teur botanist are confronted by a small library of works when either 
proposes seriously to pursue this fascinating study. The English 
reader will, however, find that two well-illustrated volumes of H. 
Stuart Thompson cover the ground fairly v/ell. Tliese are "Alpine 
Plants of Europe," 287 pp., 64 colored plates, London, 1911 ; and 
" Sub-Alpine Plants ; or Flowers of the Swiss Woods and Meadows," 
325 pp., 33 colored plates, London, 1912. 

To these might be added an excellent English translation of a 
book by Correvon and Robert, " The Alpine Flora," 436 pp., 180 
water colors, Geneva; and another but smaller work by L. and C. 
Schroter, " Coloured Vade-Mecum to the Alpine Flora," 217 colored 
and plain drawings, 21st edition, Zurich. 

In the preparation of this paper the writer has had the assistance 
of Miss Marjorie Fyfe, Mrs. Howard Wilson, and Mrs. Constance 
Domvile. These ladies spent many days (from April to September, 
1930) exploring the wooded heights, mountain meadows, hilly slopes, 
and natural rock gardens of Lucerne and Schwyz, searching for 
botanical specimens. The result is an amateur herbarium showing 
several hundred species of wild flowers, which has been a decided 
help toward an appreciation of the abundant flora of at least two 
delectable Forest Cantons.

Many years ago Professor Huxley remarked to me : " If you wish 
to clarify your ideas, you can not do better than give a lecture." The 
remark made a deep impression on me, and the truth of it has been 
abundantly verified by my subsequent experience. Our conclusions 
are not infrequently derived from premises which have l^een for- 
gotten or never fully thought out. We are apt to assume that facts 
or ideas familiar to ourselves are equally well known to the rest of 
the world, and the attempt to explain them to others makes us realize 
how far this often is from the case. Each of us lives to a large ex- 
tent in an intellectual world of his own, and it is not until we have 
to make it clear to others that we discover how much of it is over- 
shadowed or rendered misty by familiarity. 

It is not, however, the individual only whose ideas need clarifying. 
Science, as we know, is progressive, and the successive stages in its 
progress are each marked by a general atmosphere of its own. As- 
sumptions are made upon evidence which is undefined or ill defined, 
but which is taken for granted as was animism by primitive man. I 
am old enough to remember the time when layman and scholar alike 
assumed that the appearance of man upon this globe was a thing of 
yesterday. The geologists, it is true, had already begun to accustom 
the more intelligent portion of the public to the conception of a long 
period of existence for the earth itself, but so far as man was con- 
cerned, his history was still limited by the dates in the margins of 
our Bibles. Even to-day the old idea of his recent appearance still 
prevails in quarters where we should least expect to find it and so- 
called critical historians still occupy themselves in endeavoring to 
reduce the dates of his earlier history. In fact, his extremely mod- 
ern character had become so fundamental a part of our stock of 
beliefs that it is difficult to realize with what a shock the announce- 
ment came upon the ordinary educated world when as a schoolboy I 
listened to Sir Charles Lyell's famous address to the British Asso-

ciation at Bath in 1864. To a generation which had been brought up 
to believe that in 4004 B. C, or thereabouts, the world was being 
created, the idea that man himself went back to some 100,000 years 
ago was both incredible and inconceivable. 

But it was uncivilized man, not homo sapiens, as he is called to- 
day, of whom this was postulated, and between Aomo sapiens and his 
predecessor or predecessors the scientist still inserts a period of 
untold centuries. It is true that the Tasmanian with his paleolithic 
implements and mathematical deficiencies still survived into our own 
time ; but he possessed a language and could even cook his food and 
make clay vessels. It is also true that Cromagnon man had a skill 
which rivalled that of the modern European and has left us works 
of art which, considering the conditions under which they were 
produced, place him on the highest stage of artistic ability. But 
he, too, possessed speech and belonged to the later and not to the 
older Paleolithic age of Europe. After all, it has been assumed, his 
distance in time from us has not been so great when measured with 
that which separates us from Chellean and still more Eolithic man. 

Recent discoveries, however, in Southern and Eastern Africa have 
been disturbing. I learn from Sir Arthur Keith and L. S. B. 
Leakey that homo sapiens already appears in the Rift Valley of 
Kenya at the beginning of the second major pluvial period which 
may roughly correspond with the two last glacial epochs of Europe 
(the Riss and Wiirm). He had already invented pottery before 
the closing stages of that period, so that by the next wet period or 
the first post-pluvial wet phases of it he had developed a class of 
pottery of really good character. The Mousterian type of culture 
in Kenya existed contemporaneously with the Aurignacian through- 
out the second major pluvial epoch, gradually developing as time 
progressed. Homo sapiens, therefore, with his art of pottery mak- 
ing and the use of fire which it implies, is thus pushed back to an 
age which we have hitherto associated with his semisimian pre- 
decessors. 

Man, that is to say, civilized man, or man in the true sense of the 
word, must therefore have existed untold centuries ago. He already 
possessed the potentiality of speech; we may argue from his artistic 
skill and products that that potentiality had been already translated 
into fact. The greatest invention ever made by him had already 
been made. That language was an invention we knoAv; every child 
born into the world has to learn it. And language exists irrespective 
of race. Wherever we find man, however low he may be in the 
scale of humanity, he is possessed of language. The further we go 
back in his history, the more multitudinous are the languages which 
he has spoken. The tendency of an advance in civilization is to 



ANTIQUITY OF MAN — SAYCB 517 

minimize their number and merge the languages of the smaller 
tribes or nations into that of the dominant power. The Roman 
Empire was a case in point. And what is true of the multiplicity 
of languages is true also of their character. Simplicity is a sign 
of age and progress; the most intricate and complex grammar is 
usually to be found among peoples of a low type. If we could 
transport ourselves back to the Aurignacian artists of France and 
the draughtsmen of the extinct animals of Africa, I fancy we should 
find a multiplicity of dialects and languages and a corresponding 
complexity of grammar. 

What all this indicates is obvious. Civilized man— and man who 
had invented language and was a first-class artist, was already civi- 
lized man — is exceedingly old; his antiquity can not be measured 
by centuries or even by millennia. This much is the teaching of 
prehistoric archeology. Let us now turn to archeology in the more 
restricted sense of the name and see what it can tell us. 

At the outset we are met by the historians on what may be termed 
the "lower margin of archeology," whose sphere of work begins 
where that of the archeologist ends. The historian has to deal with 
literary records and his outlook, therefore, is subjective rather than 
objective. The interpretation, and, still more, the valuation of them, 
is a purely subjective matter dependent on his own judgment, preju- 
dices, and knowledge. Words, as we know, can be twisted in mani- 
fold ways and it does not follow that what the original writer meant 
by them is what his later critic believes them to signify. Where the 
documents belong to a distant past, more especially if that past be- 
longs to a different world and civilization from his own, the con- 
clusions of the critic are apt to be mistaken. They represent his 
own surroundings and not those of the past. 

The more distant the past and the more scanty the literary re- 
mains which belong to it the more doubtful and open to suspicion 
must the verdict of the historian be. His interpretation of the evi- 
dence must be purely subjective and colored by the assumptions and 
prejudices of his own time. Before we can accept it, it must be 
tested by the objective facts of archeology. 

One of the leading obsessions of the historian has been the belief 
in the recent evolution of civilization and the shortness of the period 
during which it has endured. The obsession, as I have already 
noted, is derived from medieval tradition — civilization was believed 
to have been coeval with the creation of man, and man, like the rest 
of the universe, to have been in existence only about 6,000 years. 
The science of geology in its early days had hardly penetrated into 
the ranks of the historical scholars, and the famous presidential 
address of Sir Charles Lyell on the Antiquity of Man, to which I 



518 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

have alluded at the beginning of my lecture, fell like a bombshell 
upon an unbelieving world. I well remember the sensation it cre- 
ated and the numerous criticisms and " replies " which it called 
forth. But the historian comforted himself with the assurance that 
the " man " of the geologist was not the civilized and literary man 
with whom he had to deal, but merely a superior sort of ape. Civ- 
ilized man was the man who had left books behind him which could 
be criticized and fully explained by the modern writer of books. 

Medieval tradition had left yet another belief behind it which co- 
existed with the belief in the brief duration of humanity and the 
universe. It was the belief in the decline instead of the progress 
of civilization and culture. The belief had been handed down from 
the classical world which had looked back with regret upon " a 
golden age," and it had been fostered by the manifest relapse into 
barbarism which characterized medieval Europe. Travelers in 
Egypt brought back stories of the marvelous monuments of a re- 
mote past which were still to be found there; Roman culture had 
been inferior to that of Greece, and the civilization of the Roman 
Empire had been succeeded by the Dark Ages. Civilized man, in 
short, had had but a brief existence, and it was accordingly evident 
that documents which ascribed to him an earlier date were unworthy 
of credence. It needed but little ingenuity on the part of the critic 
to resolve the earlier narratives given in them into myths and inven- 
tions and to lay down that literature in the true sense of the term 
did not exist before the seventh century B. C. The heroes of the 
old legends became solar myths and the " ancient empires of the 
East " were stripped of their antiquity. 

A new era has dawned upon us. The scientific method, aided by 
the spade, has opened up a new world and furnished us with facts 
instead of theories. And the result is that the same story, as that 
which geology had to tell us, is being retold. The age of civilized 
man must be pushed back through the centuries like the age of un- 
civilized man. Catastrophic theories are no more applicable to him 
than they are to the human being who had not yet invented language 
or learned how to cook his food. Art and culture did not spring 
suddenly into existence like Athena from the head of Zeus. 

The last hundred years have, indeed, unfolded to us a new world, 
that of the civilized past. It is difficult for me to realize to-day 
how little we knew of it in the days when I was a boy. The in- 
scriptions of Egypt and Assyria, it is true, were beginning to be 
deciphered, but the historian still looked upon their interpretation 
with suspicion, and some, like Sir George Cornewall Lewis, rejected 
it altogether. So far as the ^gean was concerned, its history began 
with the Ionic colonization of the Asiatic coast, and the " Homeric 



ANTIQUITY OF MAN SAYCE 519 

age " was synonymous with the mythological period. When listen- 
ing to a lecture last year by an eminent classical scholar upon the 
successive naval hegemonies in the eastern basin of the Mediter- 
ranean, to each of which he assigned a precise date, I could not but 
think of the contrast with the orthodox attitude of mind in my 
younger days toward what were then considered the inventions of 
a later literature. .; It was then grudgingly admitted that libraries 
might have existed in Greece in the fifth century before our era, but 
even so, they would not have been libraries in our modern sense of 
the word, in which the various branches of literature are represented 
and students come to study them. 

It is true that there were some old-fashioned people who still be- 
lieved that the earlier books of the Old Testament belonged to their 
traditional date and that some of them were written by Moses him- 
self. But this was the exception to the rule, so much the exception, 
indeed, that a special revelation from above was called in to explain 
it. And we of the younger generation, trained in the critical meth- 
ods of Germany, were unable to accept the dogma ; it rested only on 
unproved assertions and was contradicted by the character of the 
documents themselves. If there were no libraries and literature in 
early Greece, still less probable was it that they should have been 
found in the Hebrew world. 

And where there was no literature to hand down the facts of his- 
tory it was assumed to be unlikely that history could exist. Human 
memory is notoriously defective and forgetful and the phantoms 
of imagination take the place of sober facts. Instead of history we 
should expect to have folklore and fairy tales. More especially 
would this be the case in a literary community, such as that of mod- 
ern Europe, to which the critics belonged; here the memory had 
been weakened by centuries of literary tradition and the critics found 
it difficult to believe the stories that were told of Indian scholars who 
had handed down the Rig- Veda orally, or of Polynesians who pro- 
fessed to remember the names and deeds of former chieftains for 
numberless generations. The argument seemed unassailable; with- 
out books and libraries there can be no history, and since books and 
libraries could not be traced back beyond a few centuries before 
our era, the earlier so-called history of the world, it was clear, must 
be little more than myth. And from this it further followed that 
where we have no history we can not assume that civilized man ex- 
isted or could have existed for any considerable period of time. 

The historian is still largely under the spell of these preposses- 
sions and beliefs. The purely archeological record naturally leaves 
him untouched. He is content to let the archeologist discourse about 
stone and bronze ages and assign to them long periods of time so 



520 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

long as there is no question of exact dating or of interference with 
the antiquity which he would assign to his own protege, literary 
man. Here he believes he can count the generations, and the oftener 
he counts them the fewer they become. 

But archeological science, hand in hand with the decipherment 
of the languages and records of the past, has come with a rude shock, 
and the most recent discoveries have been more than usually subver- 
sive. Civilized man in the fullest sense of the word is immeasur- 
ably old. His history forms no exception to that of the rest of the 
world; though the latest comer, he too has a past which can not be 
measured by the half-dozen inches of the literary historian's rod. 
Archeology is rej)eating the lesson of geology and physical science. 

I have already touched upon the discoveries in southern and east- 
ern Africa. The consummate artists who depicted the animals of an 
extinct fauna, like their brethren in France and Spain, were repre- 
sentatives not only of homo sapiens^ but of hotno sapiens in a highly 
developed form. And think only of the conditions under which in 
Europe he drew his pictures on the walls and even the roofs of the 
caves he inhabited or carved the mammoth tusk and moulded the 
clay into lifelike figures ! The exhibition of primitive art organized 
at Manchester in 1928 by the late Sir William Boyd Dawkins must 
have been a revelation to many of us. In the subterranean dark- 
ness of a world in which the conditions were those of Iceland or 
even Greenland to-day, and by such light as could be obtained from 
a little grease, works of art were produced worthy of being grouped 
with those of a fifteenth century painter. But the artistic achieve- 
ment was more than matched by an achievement of an even greater 
nature. Man had already invented articulate language, the greatest 
and most outstanding invention he has ever made. 

But I must leave the history of homo sapiens in his earlier years to 
the geologist and prehistoric archeologist. There is one experience 
of my own, however, which I will record, as it impressed me in a 
way that no amount of books or museum specimens could have done. 
Some 30 years ago I undertook to make an archeological survey of 
the sandstone district of Gebel es-Silsila, in Upper Egypt, for the 
Egyptian Department of Antiquities. A barrage was to be built 
across the Nile at Esna, and as the engineers wished to get their 
stone for it from the sandstone rocks at Silsila, it became necessary 
to ascertain where they could do so without destroying or injuring 
any remains of antiquity. In the course of my work a few miles 
north of the Gebel I found a wadi on the western bank of the river, 
which had been the bed of a torrent that had poured into the valley 
of the Nile from the jungle that then flourished on what is now the 
western desert in the Pluvial Age, when the Sahara was covered 



ANTIQUITY OF MAN SAYCE 521 

with forest and intersected by streams. In the middle of the wadi 
was a huge boulder of sandstone, washed down from the plateau 
above and marked at about two-thirds from its base by the high- 
water level of the ancient torrent. Above this level the rock was 
covered with drawings of elephants, giraffes, and ostriches — which, 
it may be noted, had already ceased to exist in Egypt when the 
hieroglyphic script was first known in its present form. The out- 
lines of the drawings had been chipped by flint tools, some of which 
I found at the foot of the boulder. Over some of the drawings had 
been cut a hieroglyphic inscription in the age of the Eleventh Dy- 
nasty, between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago. The inscription looked 
as fresh as if it had been engraved yesterday, whereas the prehistoric 
pictures were weathered to the color of the stone. The contrast made 
me realize in a startling way the enormous length of time which 
must have elapsed since the pictures themselves were drawn. 

But historical Egypt also now has its lessons to teach us. While 
the literary historians have been vying with one another in the en- 
deavor to minimize its antiquity, the spade of the excavator has 
made discoveries which have rightly been termed " revolutionary." 
At Saqqara, under the shadow of the step pyramid, generally con- 
sidered the earliest of the pyramids still existing, Mr. Firth has laid 
bare a complex of buildings without parallel elsewhere in the coun- 
try. A stately avenue of fluted columns — indicating from whence 
the Greeks, centuries later, derived the so-called Ionic design, a 
record office or library, storage magazines, tombs, and temples, have 
been discovered, all surrounded by a vast wall 17 meters thick and 
faced on both sides with the finest masonry in Egypt. It is, in fact, 
the masonry of modern Paris or London rather than that which we 
have been accustomed to associate with the Egypt of later days. 
And at the southwestern corner the wall is overshadowed by a cir- 
cular bastion, the only circular building which ancient Egypt has 
bequeathed to us. Within the fortified enclosure subterranean pas- 
sages cut through the solid rock lead to what may have been a me- 
morial chapel of the king, while another passage to the north 
descends some 72 feet below the level of the ground to the royal 
tomb under the pyramid itself. The passages consist of wide and 
lofty corridors, the longest of which, like the tomb, has on one side 
a wall encrusted with small plaques covered with a blue glaze and 
grouped at times into the form of lotos buds or papyri bound to- 
gether.2 ^j^^g ^^U of tiles is broken into three niches built of exqui- 
sitely white limestone, in each of which is a figure of the Pharaoh 
standing or in the act of running, and set in a frame on which his 
name and titles are engraved in hieroglyphs of extraordinary beauty. 

2 Mr. Firth points out that these bundles of papyri are the origin of the Egyptian 
hieroglyph dad. 



522 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

Both figure and hieroglyphs are in low relief, and the figures of the 
king are marvels of art. Indeed, if we did not know that they 
represent King Zoser, described only as recently as 1895 in Baedeker's 
Handbook to Lower Egypt (p. 164) as " the mythical King Zoser," 
and that they were carved by Egyptian artists of the Third Dynasty, 
we should have little hesitation in ascribing them to a Greek artist 
of the age of Pericles. The muscles of the arms and legs, like the 
pose of the figures, are represented as they might have been by a 
Greek sculptor of the classical epoch. I know of nothing compar- 
able with them elsewhere in Egypt, just as I know of nothing com- 
parable with the architecture of the buildings above them ; in archi- 
tecture and in art alike Egypt would seem to have reached its climax 
in the age of Zoser, and from that period onwards, instead of prog- 
ress, there was more or less decline. A still more modern touch is 
to be found in a side passage leading from one of the corridors of 
which I have spoken, which terminates in a small chamber cut in 
the rock and presenting a startling resemblance to a retiring cham- 
ber of to-day. 

Architecture, art, and glazed tiles all testify to the long centuries 
of development which must have preceded the period of perfection 
to which they belong. And the impression made by them upon us 
is heightened when we come to examine the hieroglyphic script. It 
is already as complete and conventionalized by use as in the days of 
Rameses or Darius. The alphabet is there by the side of the syllabary 
and ideographs, and there are indications that the hieratic or cursive 
hand was already employed. As for the smaller objects of daily 
life — the furniture of the house, the jewelry and garments that were 
worn, or the articles of toilet — the discoveries made by Doctor Reis- 
ner in the tomb of the mother of Khcops, the builder of the Great 
Pyramid of Giza, prove that at the beginning of the Fourth Dynasty 
the culture and art of Egypt were still at their highest level. The 
bedstead and carrying chair of the queen, with their golden fittings, 
might even now adorn a royal palace. It will be remembered that 
Sir Flinders Petrie, when he was working at the Great Pyramid 
many years ago, discovered that the huge granite blocks used in its 
construction had been smoothed by means of tubular drills fitted 
with hard-stone points. The world had to wait until the era of the 
Mont Cenis tunnel before a similar instrument was employed again. 
When we turn to Babylonia, here also the latest discoveries have 
pushed back the highest development of its art yet known to us to 
an undetermined but remote antiquity. Hitherto ancient Babylonia, 
whether Sumerian or Semitic, has seemed artistically deficient and 
inferior; its inhabitants were primarily men of business and trade, 
the initiators of banking and international commerce but with little 
artistic sense. The royal and other tombs found by Mr. Woolley 



ANTIQUITY OF MAN — SAYCE 523 

at Ur have revolutionized our judgment on this matter. The gold 
and silver work, the inlaid designs in shell and ivory, have revealed 
an art of the first order. To those of us who have been devoting a 
lifetime to the study of Babylonian antiquity the revelation has, 
indeed, been startling. Some of the inlaid designs, with their touches 
of modern humor, seem to belong to the European world of to-day 
rather than to the oriental world of the past. And yet the tombs 
and their contents actually belong to Babylonian prehistory rather 
than history. The few inscriptions found with them are not yet 
in the fully developed cuneiform or linear script, which already had 
a long history behind it when Sargon of Akkad founded the first 
Babylonian empire in 2750 B. C. They are, in fact, still the picto- 
graphic signs out of which first the semilinear and then the cunei- 
form characters slowly developed. And along with these early semi- 
pictographic forms goes another remarkable fact. The advanced art 
and culture exhibited by the objects found in the tombs is accom- 
panied by evidence of human sacrifice on a vast scale which reminds 
us of Dahomey rather than of the Near East. Human sacrifice, how- 
ever, was not only unknown in historical Babylonia, but its very ex- 
istence at any period in the past history of the country was ignored. 
In the multitudinous religious texts which w^e now possess I can find 
no specific reference to it. The references which I thought I had 
discovered some 55 years ago have since proved to be mistaken. 
When Babylonian history begins the past existence of human sacri- 
fice is even less known to its records than it is to the beginnings of 
Anglo-Saxon history. 

And yet the royal tombs of Ur by no means belong to what, it 
is now clear, was the earliest period of Babylonian history. "Above 
the graves," Mr. Woolley tells us, " there runs, virtually unbroken, 
a stratum dated (by written tablets or clay jar stoppers) to the First 
Dynasty of Ur, about 3100 B. C, and a little below is (another) the 
seals from which seem to be rather earlier. Then comes (No. 3) a 
deep zone in which lie nearly all the graves. Below it the stratifi- 
cation continues, and in five further layers more tablets and seal 
impressions occur freely. All these are necessarily older than the 
" cemetery " into which the '• royal tombs " were sunk. The stratifi- 
cation of the city itself, where house has been built over house, 
agrees with that of the cemetery. Here, too, there are eight succes- 
sive layers, each distinguished by the remains found in it, which 
include inscribed objects. In one of the strata (the sixth) " which 
was more than 20 feet underground when the first of the royal tombs 
was made," four bulls' hooves of hammered copper were discovered 
which had belonged to a life-size statute, and in the eighth layer 
" the painted pottery resembling that of aeneolithic Susa and even 



524 ANNUAL KEPOET SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

distant China, which hitherto (had) been reported only from Jem- 
det Nasr, near Kish," makes its appearance. " Below this begin to 
appear the black and green sherds of the El-'Ubaid type," the pot- 
tery, namely, found at El-'Ubaid near Ur. We are thus taken back 
to the time when the alluvial plain of Babylonia was only beginning 
to be formed at the head of the Persian Gulf.^ 

My own belief is that the royal tombs of Ur, modern as they are 
when compared with the strata below them, belong to a pre-Sumerian 
time and to a pre-Sumerian race, which would explain the existence 
of human sacrifice to which they testify. The Sumerians called 
themselves " the black-headed people." This implies that there was 
also a blond race in the country from which their black hair and eyes 
distinguished them, and the conclusion is confirmed by the further 
fact that whereas Sumerian art represents them as broad skulled, 
most of the early skulls discovered at Ur and examined by Sir Arthur 
Keith prove to be dolichocephalic. Berossus, the Babylonian his- 
torian, tells us that the plain of Babylonia was originally inhabited 
by peoples of various origin, and an early Sumerian poem published 
by Professor Langdon explicitly states that in the prehistoric days 
Lugal-banda, king of Der, on the eastern side of the Tigris, invaded 
the country and expelled " the wicked Murru " — the Amorites of 
Semitic writers — from Erech, the future capital of a Sumerian dy- 
nasty.* On the Egyptian monuments, it must be remembered, the 
Amorites of Palestine are depicted as blonds with fair hair and blue 
eyes. I believe that in these blond Murru we must see the Mesopo- 
tamian Mitannians of later history; in a letter of the Mitannian 
king Dusratta, Mitanni is called Murru-khe, or " Murru-land," and 
I have tried to show elsewhere that the name given to the Mitannian 
neighbors of the Plittites in eastern Asia IMinor which has been read 
Kharri, or Khurri, ought to be Murri.' The latter have been iden- 
tified with the Sanskrit-speaking tribes of whom we hear in the Hit- 
tite tablets.^ At any rate, we may safely assume that they were of 
Caucasian origin. And we may, I think, further assume that the 
people, represented by the artistic treasures and human sacrifices 
in the royal tombs of Ur, were the Murrian or Amorite predecessors 
of the Sumerians. At Tepe Gawra, near Ninevah, Doctor Speiser 
has discovered tM'o strata of cultural remains below the stratum which 
belongs to the Early Bronze Age and the appearance of the Sumer- 
ians. In this last, the copper objects resemble those found at Ur and

El-Obeid, which are dated to the period of the First Dynasty of 
Ur (about 3100 B. C), whereas the earlier strata take us back to 
the aeneolithic epoch and the painted pottery of Jemdet NasrJ 

But the tombs of Ur testify to something more than an advanced 
art and human sacrifices. They indicate a wide international trade 
and the working of mines. Gold, silver, and lapis-lazuli are all 
found in them in profusion as well as copper. The gold probably 
came from the shores of the Persian Gulf, but the silver, like that 
of the Sixth Egyptian Dynasty, found by Sir Flinders Petrie at 
Abydos, was probably brought from the mines of the Taurus, while 
the lapis-lazuli, we are now assured by the geologists, was derived, 
not from northern Persia, but from northwestern India.^ The 
fact is in harmony with the discoveries recently made in China and 
northwestern India itself. In China, Professor Anderson has found 
painted and polished pottery of the neolithic and chalcolithic age, 
which is related to the neolithic pottery discovered in Susa; similar 
ware has been found in Babylonia and (by Professor Garstang) at 
Sakche-gozii, north of the Gulf of Antioch, while the recent excava- 
tions of Professor Li at Yin in Honan — the first official excavations 
of a scientific character made in China — have shown not only that 
the Shang Dynasty (1766-1154: B. C.) was historical but that the 
account of its culture and script with the long preceding develop- 
ment and commercial intercourse implied by them was based on fact. 

In India, both at Mohenjo-daro in Sind and at Harappa in the 
Punjab, a prehistoric civilization has been brought to light which 
was in close contact with that of El am and Sumerian Babylonia. 
The painted pottery, the inlaid work in mother-of-pearl and ivory, 
even the drains in the streets, all have their connections in Baby- 
lonia, and hundreds of seals and sealings have been disinterred, 
which prove that there was an active trade between northwestern 
India and western Asia. The sealings have inscriptions in picto- 
graphic script, often accompanied by representations of an Indian 
bufi'alo or the like and of an altar of various forms. In shape and 
size and general character the sealings resemble those found at 
Susa, which also bear pictographic inscriptions as well as figures of 
animals. Some of the Indian sealings have actually been found in 
Babylonia, at Jokha, the ancient Umma, as well as in the early strata 
of Kish. It is evident that a large and regular trade must liave 
existed between the two countries; a good deal of it was doubtless 
carried on by sea, but there must have been a land route as well. 
Indeed, more than 80 years ago some antiquities were discovered 
near Herat which included a Babylonian seal cylinder belonging to

the age of the Third Dynasty of Ur about 2300 B. C, which shows 
that the Land trade still existed at that period.^ When this trade 
first began we have yet to learn, but it must go back to the time when 
in Elam at least the primitive pictographs had not yet been super- 
seded by the cuneiform script. At a later date the so-called Cappa- 
docian Cuneiform tablets discovered at Kara Eyuk, 18 kilometers 
north of Kaisariyeh, have shown how extensive and modern in char- 
acter Babylonian commerce must have been at that time. Here sev- 
eral thousand tablets have been brought to light, mostly consisting 
of trading and legal documents and including a good many private 
letters. At the time when they were written the copper, lead, and 
more especially silver mines of the Taurus Mountains were being 
worked by Babylonian firms whose agents had their depot and chief 
center at Ganis, the present Kara Eyuk. " Companies " (illati) had 
been formed to exploit them and caravans traveled regularly along 
the roads which led from Asia Minor to Assur, the original capital 
of Assyria, on the one hand, and to Babylon, on the other. There 
was, in fact, what we should call a postal service, and one of the let- 
ters expresses the hope that the moon will shine brightly so that 
there might be no delay in the delivery of the mail, while another 
letter states that a particular route was being taken, as it was now 
considered safe. The tablets were enclosed in clay envelopes on 
which the addresses were inscribed as well as a statement of the 
contents. 

Some of the tablets are of the nature of cheques and bills of credit. 
The writer states in them that they represent so many manehs or 
shekels of silver, gold, or copper, in return for which cloths or other 
goods are to be sent. Besides metals, a large trade was carried on 
in textiles and clothes, showing that Asia Minor at the time was 
not only exporting metals on a large scale, but was also the seat, like 
Babylonia, of an extensive textile industry. Among the articles 
manufactured it is interesting to note the berigani, the braccae of 
the Keltic languages, and our English " breeches," which can, there- 
fore, claim a Hittite ancestry. 

The principal silver mines were at the modern Bereketli, where 
traces of the old workings have been found extending over several 
miles. Gold was also mined, but in small quantities; one of the 
sources from which it was derived seems to have been in the north- 
west of the peninsula. Iron is also mentioned, but it is uncertain 
whether this was derived from the rock or from a meteoric source. 
In the later days of the Hittite Empire we are told that " black 
iron " as distinguished from " iron," came " from heaven," like the 
ba-n-pet, " metal of heaven," which denoted " iron " in the Egyptian

hieroglyphs. At any rate, iron was already worked at a consider- 
ably earlier date than the foundation of that empire; in one of the 
Hittite tablets a king (Anittas), who seems to have flourished about 
1900 B. C, speaks of '' an iron chair," and " an iron boomerang," 
having been brought to him from Buruskhanda, where the principal 
silver mines were.^° 

The date of the Kara Eyuk documents is fortunately known. The 
forms of the characters, as well as the Assyrian proper names oc- 
curring in them, point to the age of the Third Dynasty of Ur (2418- 
2300 B. C), and this dating has been verified by the discovery of 
two sealings published by M. Thureau-Dangin and myself, one of 
which gives the name of Ibi-Sin, the fifth king of the Third Dynasty 
of Ur (2324-2300 B. C.) while the other has the name of Sargon I, 
the son of Ikimum of Assyria. We may, therefore, assign the bulk 
of the tablets to about 2300 B. C They were preserved in chests 
of stone or terra-cotta, which took the place of our safes, and often 
bore the " crest " or name of the banker to wliom they belonged. 
Thus, Professor Hrozny has disinterred one of them in the form of 
a terra-cotta box, on the lid of which a monkey is molded in relief.^^ 
They appear to have been kept in the vaults of the banks or offices 
of the companies established at Ganis. It is all very modern and 
implies a long preceding period of development and history. 

We can trace it back a few centuries. In 2750 B. C, Sargon, the 
founder of the dynasty of Akkad and of the first Semitic Empire, 
carried his arms into Cappadocia, and made his wa}^ as far as a 
mountain called Galasu, which Doctor Weidner would identify with 
Ganis, and from which he brought back various plants, including 
the rose tree, for acclimatization in Babylonia. The chief object of 
the expedition seems to have been to support the Assyro-Babylonian 
damgari or trading agents and commercial travelers who lived there 
and were occupied with the trade in minerals. A sort of " commer- 
cial treaty " was made, and a century later we find Naram-Sin, the 
grandson of Sargon, receiving homage from Zipani, King of Ganis, 
and other princes in that part of the world, one of whom was Pamba, 
the Hittite. It is worth mention that Khati in Hittite signified 
" silver," so that the Khatti or Hittites would have been " the Silver 
men " who mined and exported that metal to the ancient world. 

I need not dwell upon the length of time presupposed for the rise 
and development of all this trading activity with the means of 
traffic and use of writing which it implies. The archeological rec- 
ord of civilization is being steadily pushed back and the disturbing 
discrepancy between the facts of archeology and literary criticism is

disappearing. Civilized man is far older than the merely literary 
scholar has dreamed. 

But the archeologist also must be careful not to exceed his evi- 
dence, and, above all, not to make assumptions which belong to a 
prescientific age. When I was young, the assumption that language 
and race were interchangeable terms was still widely prevalent, and 
one of my first incursions into linguistic science was an article pro- 
testing against it in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute. 
To-day, every scientist would acknowledge its falsity, but neverthe- 
less the assumption sometimes appears even in quarters where it 
might least be expected. It can not be too often made clear that all 
linguistic science can do is to indicate geographical contact; where 
we have allied languages we have evidence of social intercourse, but 
nothing more. 

The old fallacy, however, which confused language and race to- 
gether, has been succeeded by another fallacy, which is unfortunately 
not infrequent in modern anthropological books. Similarities in 
technique are assumed without question to indicate relationship or 
contact in race and history. It is especially when dealing with 
pottery that the archeologist is tempted to assume without further 
evidence that such contact or relationship exists. But it is clear that 
mere similarity in form proves nothing of the sort when standing 
alone. The number of possible forms, for instance, belonging to 
vessels intended for use is necessarily limited; man is an inventive 
animal, and the same form could have been devised independently 
in different parts of the world. Coloration and ornament are more 
evidential, but even here there is plenty of room for the existence 
of accidental similarities. Moreover, we have to allow for primitive 
barter, which implies, not actual 'trade between two widely sepa- 
rated communities, but the passage of certain objects through a 
number of intervening hands. Thus, the painted aeneolithic pottery 
of China does not prove that there was intercourse between its 
makers and the early inhabitants of Susa and Babylonia; all that 
can be inferred is that at a particular period in the history of Asia 
there was a trade which passed slowly through a multitude of sepa- 
rate communities and races, generally assuming on its way peculiari- 
ties of its own.^- Even the megalithic monuments erected to the

Mr. Frankfort justly remarks : " Generalizations are of no avail. Thinness and thicknes.s 
of ware has been taken to illustrate differences in period as long as Susa only was 
considered ; ' Musyan ' has disqualified this criterion. Polychromy and monochromy of 
decoration no longer provide chronological indications, since Sir Aurel Stein's discoveries 
in Seistan and Professor Langdon's work at Jemdet Nasr suggest that certain monochrome 
fabrics survive and overlap the polychrome wares. Yet all those isolated qualities are 
still used as criteria for classification. But only if we insist on a many-sided resemblance, 
a resemblance affecting technique, shape, and decoration alike, before claiming the 
existence of relationship between wares from different sites, is there any likelihood of 
our not combining heterogeneous elements."

dead, of which we have heard so much of late, are in themselves 
of little historical value; long centuries, for example, separate those 
which are found in Western Europe from those which are found in 
»Iaj)an. 

In the case of an inductive science, the false assumptions or other 
faults with which it starts are corrected in time. It deals with ob- 
jective facts and not with the tastes and predilections of an individ- 
ual scholar. And the interpretation of the facts becomes more exact 
and limited with the progress of the science. Archeology has out- 
lived its years of infancy, and in its broad outlines can now take 
rank with geology. And like the geologist, the archeologist has had 
to leave catastrophic theorizing to the literary amateur. Athena 
did not spring full-grown from the head of Zeus. The art and cul- 
ture of classical Greece, we now know, had its origin in the Greece 
of the Minoan and Mycenaean Age; the invasion of the barbarian 
north overshadowed it only for awhile, but the seed remained ready 
to bud and blossom again as soon as the older race had freed itself 
from the domination of their feudal conquerors. So, too, in West- 
ern Europe, the Dark Ages were but a break in the history of its 
civilization. A thousand years are but as a day in the life of civil- 
ized man, and the Renaissance meant, not that the culture of the 
Roman Empire was reborn, but that it had been lying like the seed 
in the soil, ready to spring up again and burst into leaf as soon as 
the conditions that environed it were favorable. In scientific arche- 
ology catastrophic theories have as little place as they have in geol- 
ogy or physics. 



THE DISCOVERY OF PRIMITIVE MAN IN CHINA 



By G Elliot Smith 



[With 9 plates] 



At the time when Darwin published his Descent of Man compara- 
tively little was known of the fossil remains either of men or apes, 
so that the discussion of the evidence of paleontology played an alto- 
gether insignificant part in his argument. Apart from the discov- 
eries that had been made in the Neanderthal cave and at Gibraltar, 
nothing was known of fossil man, and what little was known was 
puzzling rather than helpful. Little more had then been recovered 
of the fossil remains of apes than a few fragments of Pliopithecus 
and Dryopithecus. 

During the 60 years that have elapsed since those times, however, 
the evidence of paleontology has come to play an increasingly promi- 
nent part in the discussion of human evolution, until at the present 
day it is the aspect of the problem that appeals most to the man in 
the street when the question of man's origin comes up for considera- 
tion. It is only 40 years since any reall}^ early remains of the human 
family were discovered, and it is a matter of some interest to discuss 
the circumstances which have led to the recovery of the remains of 
early Pleistocene man. 

Pithecanthropus was discovered 20 years after the publication of 
Darwin's Descent of Man. There had been much discussion, not 
merely on the morphological side of the question, but also on the 
problems of geographical distribution of apes and men that so closely 
affected the problem of man's evolution. The anthropoid apes 
ranged from Africa and Europe in the west as far as the eastern 
limits of the original Asiatic continent at a time when it included 
Borneo and Java as part of the unbroken land-mass. But whereas 
the chimpanzee, gorilla, and Dryopithecus seem to have wandered 
toward the west from their original home in the region of the Si- 
walik Hills of northern India, the orang-utans seem to have pre- 
ferred the Far East, where also the gibbons, after wandering west 
and east, have survived. Their presence in Borneo and elsewhere

in the Malay Archipelago suggested the possibility that man's 
ancestors may also have gone east. 

In the year 1887 Dr. Eugene Dubois, a junior member of the staff 
of the anatomy department in the University of Amsterdam, was 
offered promotion to the position of prosector, which was the step 
toward the eventual attainment of the full professorship. To the 
surprise of his colleagues he declined this promotion, and surprise 
turned to amazement when he gave the reason that he was going out 
to the East Indies to search for fossil remains of primitive man ! He 
was impressed by the fact that as the western area of migration of 
the higher Pi-imates had failed to provide any conclusive evidence 
of really early man, it might be worth exploiting the possibilities of 
the eastern route and determining whether the archaic members of 
the human family may not have followed the footsteps of the ances- 
tors of the orang-utan. He resigned his position in Amsterdam and 
went out to the Indies as an army doctor, and began to search in the 
caves of Sumatra and the fossiliferous deposits in Java for the object 
of his quest. The most amazing aspect of this adventure was Doc- 
tor Dubois's discovery of the sort of thing that had inspired his 
mission. In 1891 he found in the gravels on the banks of the Solo 
River, which natives of central Java refer to as Bengawan or " Great 
River," the fossilized remains of a braincase, a couple of teeth, and 
a femur. When these fossils were shown at the International Con- 
gress of Zoologists in Leyden in 1894 they provoked a controversy 
which has continued ever since then. 

In the first place the nature of the braincase was a matter of dis- 
pute — whether it was part of a hitherto unknown gigantic ape or of 
an equally unknown primitive type of human being, or, as Doctor 
Dubois himself maintained, a creature that was not strictly either 
simian or human, but a link between the two, the position of which 
was so enigmatic that it would be misleading to call it either an ape 
or a man. This problem, in spite of nearly 40 years of discussion, 
is still in dispute. Although the majority of anthropologists admit 
Pithecanthropus to membership of the human family, there is still 
wide divergence of opinion as to what his position in the family is, 
whether he is in the direct line of descent of later men, or whether he 
represents a specialized and divergent member of the family. Then 
again there is the question as to whether or not the teeth and the 
thigh bone which were found in the same gravels, and in a similar 
state of fossilization, are parts of the same or similar individuals, or 
whether the femur of a more definitely human type of being hap- 
pened to be deposited in the same bed of gravel with the remains of 
the Ape Man, who was a fantastic caricature of a human being. 
There are the widest divergences of opinion even at the present time 
on this issue. 



PRIMITIVE MAN- IN CHINA SMITH 533 

Then again the question of the geological age of the fossils has 
been a subject of controversy. When Doctor Dubois first discovered 
the fossils he was impressed by the fact that the associated mam- 
malian remains seemed to be identical with types which occur in the 
Pliocene beds in the Indian SiAvaliks. Hence he regarded the fossils 
as evidence of the former existence in Java of Tertiary man. The 
further study of these remains, and in particular the gradual ac- 
cumulation of knowledge regarding the fossil mammalia of Asia, 
have since convinced most paleontologists that the age of the Java 
fossils is Pleistocene and not Pliocene. Two years ago (February 22, 
1929) Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborn, the president of the American 
Museum in New York, called attention (Science, vol. 69, p. 216) to 
certain facts, which had impressed Professor Dietrich of Berlin and 
himself, that the proboscidean and other mammalian remains asso- 
ciated with the human fossils belong not to the Early Pleistocene 
but to the Middle Pleistocene Age, suggesting that the Ape man of 
Java was relatively much more recent than had hitherto been 
supposed. 

The total result of these discussions is that the precise age and the 
significance of the fossils found by Doctor Dubois 40 years ago are 
still matters of lively controversy and considerable doubt. 

Nearly 30 years ago the late Mr. Charles Dawson, a lawyer 
practising at Lewes in Sussex, who had then devoted more than 30 
years of his life to the hobby of hunting for fossil remains of ex- 
tinct animals in the Weald of Sussex, was attending a land court at 
the Manor of Barkham near Piltdown, when he noticed the road 
leading up to the manor house being repaired with flint. During 
the sitting of the manorial court over which he was presiding, in- 
stead of giving the whole of his attention to the legal business in 
hand, he was unable to restrain his roving fancies from wondering 
why people should be using such poor material as flint to repair a 
road when, as he thought, the cost of bringing it from the nearest 
source known to him, which was more than 5 miles away, would have 
been almost sufficient to have paid for proper road metal. Hence, 
as soon as the court rose for lunch he went out to make further en- 
quiries, and discovered from the workmen that the reason why flint 
was being used was that it was present on the spot. The road itself 
crossed the small patch of gravel which the men were digging up to 
mend it. Mr. Dawson instructed the workmen to keep a lookout for 
any fossil remains which they might find in this bed of gravel, and 
from time to time, whenever any excavation was going on, he vis- 
ited Barldiam Manor to keep a watch on the excavation. 

Years afterwards he visited the spot to find the workmen, in defi- 
ance of the instructions he had given them, throwing stones at what 



534 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

they thought was an old coconut obtained from the gravels. He 
at once rescued the fossilized remains of a piece of a phenomenally 
thick human braincase, and began excavating there and recovering 
other pieces. The massiveness of the skull and the Pleistocene age 
of the deposits suggested to Mr. Dawson's mind that he had found 
part of the braincase of the only Pleistocene man at that time known 
in Europe. The Heidelberg jaw had been found in 1907 and is all 
that we know of this peculiar type of the human family which prob- 
ably represents the distinct genus of Palaeanthropus. In 1912 he 
took the fragments to Dr. (now Sir Arthur) Smith Woodward, at 
that time Keeper of Geology at the British Museum (Natural His- 
tory) , and they set to work to dig the gravels at Piltdown. 

In the summer of 1912 they found a fossilized jaw, which at once 
convinced them that they were dealing with a creature totally distinct 
from the Heidelberg man, one who was very much more primitive 
and apelike and also much older even than that Pleistocene man of 
Germany. The announcement of these discoveries, at a meeting of 
the Geological Society in London in December, 1912, started a series 
of controversies which were even livelier and more confusing than 
those which had raged since 1894 around Pithecanthrofus. For 
there was not only the same element of doubt as to the significance 
and age of the Piltdown fragments, but there were several new 
elements of controversy in the Sussex discoveries. The question of 
age was subject to the same uncertainty as I have mentioned in the 
case of Pithecanthropus; the fragments of bone had been deposited 
by running water in gravels; and in these gravels there were the 
remains of Pliocene as well as Pleistocene mammals. As the skull 
itself showed no signs of rolling, such as many of the Pliocene fos- 
sils displayed, it was assumed that it was contemporaneous with the 
undamaged Pleistocene fossils. But there were many elements of 
uncertainty in the determination of the geological age of the speci- 
mens, and recently Professor Osborn has been putting forward a 
view in opposition to the one which is now commonly accepted, that 
the Piltdown skull may possibly be Tertiary in age and not Quater- 
nary as was supposed. " The problem is whether it came from a 
Pliocene gravel bank with a primitive elephant and mastodon, or 
from a Pleistocene gravel bank with a primitive hippopotamus." 
(Science, 1929, p. 217.) There has, moreover, been the liveliest dis- 
cussion as to whether or not the jaw which was found at Piltdown 
was not that of a chimpanzee rather than of a human being. Even 
after 20 years of discussion there is no complete consensus of opinion 
upon this issue. 

The problem of the precise mode of reconstruction of the skull 
gave rise to unseemly and wholly unnecessary discussions which 



PKIMITIVE MAN IN CHINA — SMITH 535 

served to create a widespread confusion in the minds, not merely of 
the general public, but even of anatomists and paleontologists, and 
profound doubt as to the importance and precise significance of this 
great discovery in Sussex. This lack of confidence in the validity of 
the remains of Pithecanthropus and Eoanthropus was intensified by 
the fact that these two doubtful members of the human family were 
so dissimilar that they seemed to be hardly compatible with one an- 
other. This increased the doubt as to whether two primitive mem- 
bers of the human family who were supposed to be roughly con* 
temporaneous one with the other — that is, Early Pleistocene in age — 
could differ so profoundly as these two skulls did, although the 
whole breadth of the great continent of Europe and Asia separated 
them from one another. So profound is the scepticism concerning 
Piltdown Man that important treatises on the fossil remains of man 
published in Germany during the last few years have either re- 
frained altogether from referring to the Piltdown discovery (which 
obviously is of crucial importance) or have stated that the issue is so 
doubtful as to be excluded from the argument. 

Even those of us who have always been convinced that both 
Pithecanthropus and Eoanthropus were genuine members of the 
human family, were somewhat puzzled to know how to define their 
relations to one another, and precisely what light they shed upon 
the process of the evolution of later types of human beings. 

The discovery of SinantJiropus in China has put an end to this 
uncertainty and marks a new epoch in human paleontology. The 
skull found at Chou Kou Tien on December 2, 1929, has dissipated 
the chief elements of doubt and uncertainty in regard to the other 
two genera of the human family, for it not only provides us with 
much fuller and unequivocal, information concerning a third and 
hitherto unknown genus of early Pleistocene man, but in addition 
it establishes a bond of union between the other two types, and 
shows that the Ape Man of Java and the Dawn Man of Piltdown are 
not really incompatible with one another. Many of the most charac- 
teristic features of these two divergent types are combined in the 
same individual of the genus Sinanthropus. Hence it clears away 
the mists of doubt and suspicion. Thus the discovery in China is not 
only a tremendous contribution to the exact knowledge of early 
Pleistocene man, but in addition it gives a respectability to these 
other early men, whose remains were being discredited, and a co- 
herence to our knowledge of all three types which thus establishes 
upon a sure foundation our knowledge of the most primitive men 
so far recovered. 

The discovery of the Peking remains is a romantic story, differing 
from the finding of the other two genera, just as the nature of the 



536 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

circumstances under which the fossils were deposited differs from 
those revealed in Java and in Sussex respectively. The remains of 
the Peking man were not deposited by running water in river 
gravels, but left by their original owners on the floor of a cave of 
Ordovician limestone where they and a large series of mammals dwelt 
in Early Pleistocene times. Hence the geological age is certain. 
The elements of doubt which arise in the case of Pithecanthropus and 
Eoanthro'pus do not arise in the case of Sinanthropus. 

Nearly 30 years ago Doctor Haberer purchased in a druggist's 
shop in Peking a collection of " dragon's bones " which he sent to 
Prof. Max Schlosser in the University of Munich. Shortly after- 
wards, in 1903, Professor Schlosser published (in Abh. konigl. Ba- 
yerisch-Akad., Wiss. Math. Phys. KL, vol. 22, pp. 20-21, 1903) a mem- 
oir under the title " Die fossilen Siiugethiere Chinas nebst einer Od- 
ontographie der recenten Antilopen," giving his identifications of the 
series of fossil remains he was able to recognize among this collec- 
tion of Chinese drugs. On pages 20 and 21 of this memoir there is 
a section called " The Description of the Primate Types," which is 
of such exceptional interest and importance that I shall translate 
that portion of the description which is defined as " ? Anthropoide 
g. n. et sp. ind." ? In his account Professor Schlosser says, " In the 
collection recently sent by Doctor Haberer from Peking there was 
a left upper third molar, either of a man or a hitherto unknown 
anthroj)oid ape. This tooth is completely fossilized and is quite 
opaque. Moreover it exhibits between its roots a reddish clay such 
as is found only in teeth which belong to the Tertiary period and 
are earlier than the loess. Hence it is probable that a Tertiary age 
should be ascribed to the specimen. Unfortunately the tooth is al- 
ready much damaged and its surface corroded by the roots of plants, 
so that the original appearance of its surface can not be accurately 
determined." After giving an account of the position of the various 
projections on the surface of the crown in comparison with other 
teeth, and describing the form of the body of the tooth and its 
roots with their respective measurements. Professor Schlosser pro- 
ceeds to consider how to determine the zoological status of the orig- 
inal possessor of the tooth. The form of the tooth and morphology 
of the roots are distinctly manlike. On the other hand the state of 
preservation of the tooth makes it clear that it is of remote antiquity, 
possibly as old as the Tertiary period, which suggests the improb- 
ability of it belonging to the genus Homo. 

In fact the Tertiary existence of any type of man is not yet 
established. Hence the possibility has to be considered whether 
this tooth may belong to a hitherto unknown genus of anthro- 
poid ape, which in the structure of its teeth approached more 



PRIMITIVE MAH IN CHINA SMITH 537 

nearly to man than any other known anthropoid ape. Another 
possibility, he says, is that the tooth may be that of a human being 
which in some way became displaced and got into the Tertiary 
beds although belonging to a more recent period. He suggests, 
for instance, that possibly the tooth was only of Pleistocene age, 
which raises the difficulty that the state of fossilization is such 
as he has found only in teeth which are either Tertiary in age 
or are referable to the very beginning of the Pleistocene. He ad- 
mits that he can not pretend to distinguish between the state of 
fossilization between the earliest Pleistocene and the Tertiary. He 
admits that a definite answer to this riddle must necessarily be only 
tentative — for no other early human remains except Pithecanthropus 
were then available for comparison. No useful purpose would be 
served by comparing this third molar tooth (with its marked differ- 
ence in size and much more strongly reduced roots) with the tooth 
of Pithecanthropus^ the roots of which were much more exception- 
ally divergent. He calls particular attention to the fact that the 
fossil found in China presents a much nearer likeness to the tooth 
from the Indian Siwaliks which Lydekker has described as Troglo- 
dytes sivalensis, to which Dubois refers as PalcBopithecus sivalensis. 
The third molar tooth in this Indian anthropoid presents a close 
resemblance to the Chinese tooth. It is distinguished, however, only 
by relatively slight differences in size and the position of the roots. 
After detailed comparisons between these teeth of fossil anthro- 
poids and primitive men (including Pithecanthropus and the Nean- 
derthal remains from Krapina) Schlosser refers to the possibility 
that the tooth from Peking may be the remains of the oldest human 
being known at that time and one that displayed a closer likeness to 
the apes than any other known fossil. While admitting that, how- 
ever unpardonable it might be tacitly to evade the issue, it is im- 
portant to try to define a systematic position which obviously 
could not be finally determined by the scanty evidence at that time 
available. 

Hence he defines the aim of his communication to suggest to later 
investigators who may enjoy the privilege of carrjdng out excava- 
tions in China the desirability of searching for the remains either 
of a new fossil anthropoid, a Tertiary man, or an Early Pleistocene 
human being. In recording the complete realization of the third 
possibility adumbrated by the veteran German paleontologist, it 
would be unpardonable not to refer to Professor Schlosser's insight 
and courage. He correctly predicted the age and the nature of the 
type of being whose damaged tooth came into his possession without 
any indication either of its provenance or of the geological circum- 
stances under which it had been recovered. One can not withhold 



538 AlfNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

admiration for his wonderful imagination which enabled him to 
make this amazingly accurate prediction, which the discoveries of 
the last five years in China have so amply corroborated. 

This brilliant forecast was made in 1903, but nothing further was 
done towards the realization of it until the year 1921, when Prof. 
J. Gunnar Andersson, the Swedish geologist who was acting as the 
Adviser to the Geological Survey of China, was directed to a deposit 
of fossil bones at Chou Kou Tien through overhearing the chatter 
of his native workmen. When he started to examine the rich de- 
posit of fossil bones in the cave at Chou Kou Tien he found amongst 
these remains a piece of quartz, and at once remarked to his assist- 
ants, " This is primitive man," implying by that statement that 
as quartz did not naturally occur in this spot, some early Pleisto- 
cene human agency must have been responsible for its presence 
among the bones which he was examining. In a way this inference 
is almost as remarkable as that which Professor Schlosser had made 
over 20 years previously. 

The funds available for the Chinese Geological Service were inad- 
equate to carry out the examination of these fossils with the thor- 
oughness which their importance merited, but Doctor Andersson 
obtained from Mr. Ivar Kreuger, of Stockholm, financial aid which 
enabled the investigations to be continued and extended. 

The material obtained from Doctor Zdansky's excavations at Chou 
Kou Tien in 1922 was taken to Professor Wiman's laboratory in 
Upsala for examination; and in 1926, on the occasion of the visit 
of the Crown Prince of Sweden to Peking it was announced that 
two human teeth had been found, an immature left lower molar, and 
a somewhat worn adult right upper premolar. 

In the Bulletin of the Geological Society of China, volume 5, 
Nos. 3-^, page 284, 1927, Doctor Zdansky gave an account of these 
teeth, the concluding two paragraphs of which I quote in his own 
words : 

Granted the human origin of the teeth, there arises the question of their 
relation to the living and prehistoric races of man. ... 1 am indeed con- 
vinced that the existing material provides a wholly inadequate foundation for 
many of the various theories based upon it. As every fresh discovery of what 
may be human remains is of such great interest not only to the scientist but 
also to the layman, it follows only too naturally that it becomes at once the 
object of the most detailed — and, in my opinion, too detailed — investigation. 
I decline absolutely to venture any far-reaching conclusions regarding the ex- 
tremely meagre material described here, and which, I think, can not be more 
closely identified than as Homo sp. 

The above has been written largely because I find I am credited, in certain 
quarters, with the discovery of the "Peking man" (vide daily newspapers), 
which is supposed to be of Tertiary age. Leaving until a future date the 
publication of a detailed description of the fossil fauna from Chou Kou Tien, 



PRIMITIVE MAN IN CHINA SMITH 539 

my purpose here is only to make it clear that my discovery of these teeth 
(which are of Quatermiry age) should be regarded as decidedly interesting 
but not of epoch-making importance. 

Dr. Davidson Black, however, took a different view of the signifi- 
cance of the teeth. To him they were definitely of epoch-making 
importance. Moreover, he had the courage to act upon his convic- 
tion. He had been jDrofoundly influenced by the memoir published 
in 1915 by the late Prof. W. D. Matthew, F. R. S., " Climate and 
Evolution." (Ann. New York Acad. Sc, vol. 24, 171.) In fact, 
the possibility (suggested by Doctor Matthew's argument) of the 
discovery of primitive man in China decided Dr. Davidson Black 
to accept the invitation, which he received after the war, to join 
the staff of the Anatomy Department in the Peking Union Medical 
College. The reality of Doctor Black's conviction was Imown to me, 
not only by statements in his private letters, but also in the memoir 
which he published in 1925 entitled "Asia and the Dispersal of Pri- 
mates," (Bull. Geol. Soc. China, vol. 4, no. 2, p. 133.) Hence when, 
a year later. Doctor Zdansky found human teeth in the early Pleis- 
tocene or, as was then thought, late Pliocene, beds, Dr. Davidson 
Black regarded this as a definite realization of the aim which he had 
set before him several years before, and naturally regarded the 
discovery as truly epoch-making. 

In a communication which, at the request of Doctor Andersson, he 
made at the scientific meeting held in Peking on October 22, 1926, 
he emphasized these considerations, and was able to interest Dr. 
Henry Houghton, then director of the Peking Union Medical Col- 
lege, and Edwin Embree, then secretary of the Rockefeller founda- 
tion, to support an appeal for financial help to carry on the search at 
Chou Kou Tien. The late Dr. Richard Pearce, at that time director 
of the medical division of the Rockefeller Foundation, so far appre- 
ciated the significance of the possibilities that he induced the Founda- 
tion to make an appropriation for two years' work on the site. 

This project met with immediate success, for on October 16, 1927, 
Dr. Birger Bohlin found a human lower molar tooth in the deposit 
at Chou Kou Tien, where Doctor Zdansky found the teeth reported 
on October 22, 1926. On December 2, 1927, Dr. Davidson Black an- 
nounced to the Geological Society of China this important discov- 
ery and his courageous decision to use it as evidence for the creation 
of a new genus and species of the human family. 

On the suggestion of Dr. A. W. Grabau, professor of paleontology 
in the National University of Peking, he called it Sinanthro'pus 
pekinensis. The age of the deposits in which the fossils were found 
was thought at this time to be Upper Pliocene; but a more careful 



540 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

sifting of the evidence provided by the associated mammals subse- 
quently led the geologists to decide that the real age was Lower 
Quaternary (very early Pleistocene). Professor Schlosser in 1903 
and all subsequent writers for the next quarter of a century believed 
that fossils found in deposits earlier than the loess of the Chili 
plain were Pliocene. But investigations during the season 1927-28, 
fully recorded in the exhaustive report published by Pere Teilhard 
de Chardin and Dr. C. C. Young (Bull. Geol. Soc. China, 1929, p. 
173), established the age of the fossils as Early Pleistocene. 

Dr. Davidson Black claimed that the morphology and the pro- 
portions of the tooth left no doubt either of its human origin or of 
the fact that it is generically distinct from all other known human 
types. He came to the conclusion that its original possessor was a 
child corresponding in age to that attained by modern children at 
8 years, and presumed that it was derived from the same jaw as the 
lower premolar tooth whose discovery was reported in 1926 by 
Doctor Zdansky. 

In 1903 Professor Schlosser had emphasized the fact that while 
the tooth he was describing on that occasion differed from those of 
other known human and simian remains, morphologically it was 
essentially human in type, but revealed certain remarkable points of 
similarity to one of the fossil apes from the Siwalik Hills. The tooth 
found in 1927, like that of 1903, was partly embedded in a stony 
matrix which, in addition to the condition of mineralization of the 
tooth itself, corroborated the extreme age of the specimen. 

In a monograph published in 1927 (Palaeontologia Sinica, ser. D, 
vol. 7) Dr. Davidson Black gave a detailed description of the tooth 
found by Doctor Bohlin in that year. He called attention to its dis- 
tinctive characters, and contrasted it with a series of primitive hu- 
man and simian teeth. He provides ample justification for his action 
in creating a new genus and species of the human family. He shows 
how every character of the tooth, the form and proportions of the 
crown, the peculiarities of the roots and the size and form of the 
pulp cavity all agree in conferring upon Sinanthrofus a distinctive 
position intermediate between man and ape. Moreover, he shows 
how generalized are the characters of the tooth, so that it enables us 
to understand how the peculiarities revealed in the later types of the 
human family have been derived from this extremely primitive type 
by differentiation of some of the potentialities so clearly manifest 
in this interesting tooth. He showed also with great clearness how 
the pattern of the crown showed a distinct likeness to that revealed 
in the fossil ape DryopithectLS. 

In spite of the very thorough and complete demonstration of the 
fact that the tooth of Sinanthropus was of early Pleistocene age and 



PRIMITIVE MAN IN CHINA — SMITH 541 

SO definitely different from that of all other known human teeth (an 
extremely generalized human type presenting obvious analogies to 
the conditions found in the fossil apes which most nearly conform 
to the human type) Doctor Black's action in creating a new genus 
did not meet with any widespread support. A year later, however, 
the discovery made by Dr. Birger Bohlin, working in conjunction 
with Dr. C. C. Young and Mr. W. C. Pei, of fragments of two jaws 
and braincases, provided evidence which confirmed the validity of 
the genus founded in 1927. The tooth upon which Doctor Black 
based his definition of the new genus conformed in character to the 
two teeth whose discovery was announced in 1926, as well as to the 
tooth described by Schlosser in 1903, and there can be no doubt that 
these four teeth all belong to SinantJir&pus. One of the teeth found 
by Doctor Zdansky in 1926 probably came from the same jaw as 
the type specimen found in 1927. The two jaws found in 1928 con- 
tained a number of teeth conforming to the same characteristic mor- 
j)hological types as that found in 1927. Both jaw fragments, one 
of a child and the other of an adult, display very significant peculi- 
arities in the chin region. The oblique slope of the anterior surface 
is comparable only to that of anthropoid apes and the Piltdown jaw; 
and a peculiar conformation of the lingual aspect of the jaw is 
analogous to, though not exactly identical with, the peculiarities of 
the jaw found at Piltdown in 1912, which has been a subject of the 
liveliest controversy ever since. 

While the finding of this peculiar apelike type of jaw in associa- 
tion with fragments of braincases, which are unquestionably human, 
provides corroboration of the justice of regarding the tooth of 1927 
as a new genus, it also affords evidence which can not be ignored in 
support of the validity of regarding the jaw found at Piltdown a& 
part of the same human individual whose broken skull was also 
found alongside it. The features of the jaws of Sinanthropus at first 
raised the possibility that the fossil man of China might be more 
nearly akin to the early Pleistocene man of Piltdown than to the 
Ape Man of Java. It would, however, be more accurate to say that, 
as nothing whatever is known of the type of jaw of Pithecanthro'pus, 
the only human jaw susceptible of comparison with the Peking jaws 
was that found at Piltdown. The contrast between the teeth of Pithec- 
atithropus and those of Sinanthropus suggest that there must have 
been a considerable difference between the jaws of those two primitive 
genera. In 1929, however, the finding of an almost complete brain- 
case of Sinanthropus by Mr. W. C. Pei revealed a type of skull 
which, while it was still embedded in the hard matrix of travertine 
(involving the base and a greater part of the sides of the sloill) 
seemed to be much more nearly akin to the jkull of Pithecanthropus 



542 



ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 



than to that of Eoanthropus. While there is this obtrusive general 
resemblance to Pithecanthropus^ however, it is important not to 
minimize the peculiarly significant expansion of the frontal and 
parietal parts of the braincase which so definitely distinguishes it 




FiouuE 1. — Base of the Peking skull alier rouioviuy; ihe travertine from its interior

that just as the finding of the jaws in 1928 suggested the possibility 
of some kinship with the Piltdown man, the skull found in 1929 
caused opinion to swing in the other direction and suggested a nearer 
kinship with Pithecanthropus. In 1930, however, when after four 



PRIMITIVE MAN- IN CHINA SMITH 543 

months of intensive work, Dr. Davidson Black completely liberated 
the skull from the matrix of travertine, the braincase was revealed 
with a curious blend of characters hitherto regarded as distinctive, 
some of them of Pithecanthro'pus and others of Eoanthroyus. The 
combination in the same specimen of peculiar characters hitherto 
regarded as incompatible one with the other was not only important 
as a revelation of the extremely primitive and generalized qualities 
of Sinanthropus^ but, what was even more important, it formed a 
link between the other two genera of early Pleistocene men, concern- 
ing the validity and significance of which there had been so much 
doubt and suspicion. Hence the skull found in 1929 not onlj'- estab- 
lished on a firm foundation our knowledge of primitive man to which 
it gave coherence and in which it inspired confidence, but in addition 
it revealed a type which was so primitive as to enable us to visualize 
the characters of the common ancestor of all three genera. 

If the size and form of the eyebrow-ridges (pi. 4) and the median 
frontal crest (pi. 2) suggest a kinship with Pithecanthropus^ the 
form of the posterior aspect of the skull (pi. 1, fig. 2) presents a 
marked contrast to the Java fossil and a definite likeness to 
Eoanthropus. 

As long ago as 1903, Professor Schlosser defined the contrast be- 
tween the tooth he was discussing and those of Pithecanthropus, 
differences which have been still further emphasized by Dr. Davidson 
Black with the fuller material at his disposal. 

The braincase of Sinanthropus differs from that of Pithecan- 
thropus not only in the matter of the local expansions of the frontal 
and parietal areas, but also in its general form and the characters 
of its cranial bones, for the exceptional thickness of the cranium 
(pis. 5 and 6), and the peculiar architecture of the bones repro- 
duce conditions which hitherto have been regarded as distinctive 
of Eoanthropus. The form of the surprisingly small cranial cavity 
presents a significant contrast to that of Pithecanthropus, being nar- 
rower and loftier, and free from the grosser type of distortion re- 
vealed in the broad flat endocranial cast of Pithecanthropus. The 
braincase of Sinanthropus reveals many features which are un- 
known either in the Ape Man of Java or in the Piltdown skull, and 
throws a great deal of light upon the characters of the common 
ancestor of the human family, from which all these genera had been 
derived. One of the most striking illustrations of this fact is the 
peculiar form of the mastoid region of the temporal bone, recalling 
as it does the condition found in the new-born child and in the adult 
anthropoid apes, for it lacks that salient character which is so 
distinctive of the adult human of other genera (pis. 3 and 4, fig. 1). 



544 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

The skull found in 1929 is that of a young adult corresponding 
in the state of its development with the condition found in modern 
human skulls at about 16 years of age. When the skull was first 
examined Dr. Davidson Black was impressed by the grace of its 
contours in comparison with the uncouth outlines of Pithec- 
anthropus^ and suggested the possibility that it might be female, with 
the reservation, of course, that the evidence at our disposal regard- 
ing this hitherto unknown type of being was altogether inadequate 
for any definite decision upon this matter. Its grace, however, may 
be due to its primitiveness and the fact that it is free from those 
secondary distortions which give the degenerate Pithecanthropus 
its bizarre character. The discovery of another braincase (pi. 9) was 
made in July, 1930, by recovering from material brought in from the 
Chou Kou Tien cave (in October, 1929) a series of fragments which 
naturally articulated one with the other to form the greater part 
of the calvaria. This discovery of a skull of another individual 
probably more than 10 years older than the one found in Decem- 
ber, 1929, revealed a more lightly built slmll with small eyebrow 
ridges, a less prominent forehead and less obtrusive parietal emin- 
ences, which both Dr. Davidson Black and I consider to be probably 
of different sex from the other skull. It seems probable, however, 
that the skull reported in July, 1930, may prove to be female and the 
other skull (found on December 2, 1929) male; but at present 
neither opinion can be said to be based upon any really decisive 
evidence. The discovery of a second skull enormously enhances 
the value of the information we have because it permits compari- 
sons to be made. In Figure 2, SD indicates the place where this 
skull was found, a few feet above the spot (SE) where the skull was 
found in December, 1929. 

In the material found in 1928 there are remains of two other 
broken skulls (still embedded in travertine), which provide other 
important comparative material for studying the range of variation 
of the skulls. 

AVliether or not the Peking man was older than the fossils found 
in Java and Sussex, there is no doubt that he represents a more 
primitive type. His characters are more generalized, some of them 
distinctly reminiscent of man's simian ancestry and others strangely 
foreshadowing the qualities hitherto regarded as distinctive of Homo 
sapiens. In other words, Sinanthropus enables us to picture the 
qualities of the original members of the human family by revealing 
a type which, though human, was curiously ape-like, and obviously 
close to the main line of descent of modern man. 

The work of investigation and of recording the results has been 
carried on with exceptional thoroughness and imaginative insight.

It was hoped by Dr. Davidson Black that the prompt publication 
of bulletins and the wide circulation of manuscript rei^orts even 
before they were published, would have prevented the development 
of such misunderstandings as had marred the discussions of the 
fossil remains of man in the past. In spite of these precautions, 
eminent paleontologists in Germany and France are already claiming 
that the Peking man belongs to the genus Pithecanthropus; others 
in America have suggested that he is merely a Far Eastern example 
of Neanderthal Man ; and others again that the Chinese fossils were 
not human. 

Having made a careful examination of the actual fossils in Peking 
and compared them with human and simian skulls, and the casts 
of the other kinds of extinct members of the human family, I can

Figure 3. — Transverse sections in the plane of the acoustic meatus of the Peking sliull

confidently support the opinion of Dr. Davidson Black that Sinan- 
thropus is an undoubted member of the human family, who reveals 
in every part of his skull and teeth evidence to distinguish him from 
all other known human types, and to justify the separate generic 
rank suggested to define his status. 



THE INDUSTRIES 



In studying the remains of early man it is always a matter of 
particular importance to search for the tools and implements which 
might bring the human beings into association with some definite 
phase of industry. At Chou Kou Tien, in spite of the most careful 
search in the caves during four years, no trace whatever of im- 



PRIMITIVE MAN IN CHINA SMITH 547 

plements had been found. When it is considered how vast a quan- 
tity of fossils were recovered and the scrupulous care which has 
been exercised in the search, it seems something more than a mere 
coincidence that no trace of any stone implements were found. Not 
only were the various excavators on the constant lookout for such 
artifacts (in particular Father Teilhard has been looking for ar- 
cheological evidence), but after the material was removed from the 
caves, a group of boys was put on to sift the material once more 
to make quite certain that no such evidence had been overlooked 
by the geological explorers. It must not be forgotten, however, that 
Doctor Andersson in 1921 found pieces of quartz in association with 
the fossil bones, and that in the later stages of the excavation Mr, Pei 
found further examples of this alien material. Those who have been 
searching in vain for evidence of human craftsmanship on this site 
were being forced to the conclusion that the Peking man was in 
such an early phase of development as not yet to have begun to 
shape implements of stone for the ordinary needs of his daily life. 
In the spring of 1931, however, Mr. Pei began to examine the 
adjoining cave of Kotzetang (fig. 2) and was at once rewarded by dis- 
coveries of exceptional interest and significance. In association with 
two large fragments of a human jaw and three pieces of a brain case 
(found at SG, fig. 2) thousands of pieces of quartz, quartzite, and 
other alien stones were found. Some of these had been fashioned 
into implements which the discoverers regard as the crudest possible 
type of flaking, but the Abbe Breuil claims to be surprisingly ad- 
vanced. (Bull. Geol. Soc. China, 1931; also Man, Jan. and April, 
1932.) Not only so but Mr. Pei and Dr. Davidson Black found 
conclusive evidence of the use of fire and, according to the Abbe 
Breuil, of the splitting of the bones of large mammals to obtain 
marrow, the making of implements of bone and deer-horn, and the 
working of the brain-cases of deer to make drinking cups. No longer 
then is there any room for doubt that the most generalized member 
of the human family had already acquired the skill and the intelli- 
gence which are the hall-marks of his humanity.

THE CULTURE OF THE SHANG DYNASTY 



By James M. Menzies 



THE PERIOD 



The Shang Dynasty is the name given by Chinese historians to 
that line of kings which preceded the Chou.^ According to the west- 
ern equivalents of the dates calculated by Ssii-ma Ch'ien, the author 
of the Shih Chi or " Historical Record," the Shang Dynasty lasted 
from 1766 B. C. to 1122 B. C, or, in other words, for 644 years 
beginning some 12 centuries before Confucius. These traditional 
calculations are, however, probably incorrect, and I have provision- 
ally adopted two statements made in the ancient " Bamboo Books," 
excavated about the year 281 A. D. and dating from the fourth or 
third century B. C. These state that " from the founding of the 
Shang Dynasty by Ch'eng T'ang until its destruction by the Chou 
people was a period of 496 years " ; and that " from the time of the 
moving of the capital by P'an Keng to the present Waste of Yin 
until the end of the dynasty, 273 years elapsed." According to the 
" orthodox " dating of the overthrow of the Shang Dynasty, 1122 
B. C. (although some would place it as late as 1050 B. C), its found- 
ing would haA^e occurred in 1618 B. C, and the movement of its 
capital, just mentioned, in 1395 B. C. 

In any case, the Shang period corresponds to that of the Late 
Bronze Age in the Near East. Within it fall the reigns of the 
religious reformer Akhenaton and his son-in-law Tutankhamon in 
Egypt; the occupation of Canaan by the HebrcAvs; the Minoan Pe- 
riod in Crete; and the Heroic Age in Greece. During its course 
Babylonia was under the sway of the Kassites; and it was perhaps 
then that the Aryan invasion of India took place. This historical 
background will aid us to correlate the Shang period in China with 
the better known history of the Occident. 

THE SOURCES 

Let us see now upon what evidence an appraisal of the culture of 
the Shang Dynasty must be based. Our principal and most author-

itative source is to be found in the inscribed bones from the Waste 
of Yin. In 1899 the first of these to attract attention were found 
5 li (nearly 2 miles) northwest of the city of Chang-te Fu, otherwise 
known as An-yang, in northern Honan, It long remained unknown 
whence these bones came, although collections of them were made by 
Chinese antiquarians, among them L'iu T'ieh-yiin and Lo Chen-yii. 
Some specimens, both genuine and forged, were also secured by the 
Kev. Samuel Couling and Dr. Frank Chalfant, and later by L. C. 
Hopkins and by Dr. Richard Wilhelm. Certain curio dealers stated 
that the place of origin of the bones was the tomb of Pi Kan, near 
Wei-hsien, while others claimed that they came from Yu-li, in T'ang- 
yin, where Wen Wang was imprisoned.^ Again, Lo Chen-yii, the 
well known antiquarian above mentioned, was informed that they 
were being found at An-yang. No responsible scientist, however, 
had personally confirmed the place of their origin, and everyone was 
dependent upon the hearsay reports of dealers. 

I first visited the Waste of Yin in the early spring of 1914. The 
site has nothing about it to attract particular attention, save for 
the broken potsherds, which the farmers have carefully gathered 
from the surface of the ground, and which have become buried along 
the edges of the fields. From 1914 until the present I have carefully 
collected the many fragments of inscribed bones which have come 
in my way. The dealers from the cities would purchase only large 
specimens; small pieces were not wanted. Of these latter I was 
fortunate enough, in the course of 15 years, to collect many thou- 
sands, some no larger than a bean. These fragments have formed 
the source material for my study. Broken potsherds and stone and 
bone implements I also found and kept. It was at no time possible, 
however, to do any excavating. I could only make observations on 
exposed sections of the soil along the river bank. Unfortunately 
all my material was destroyed during the disturbances which took 
place in 1927. 

In the autumn of 1928 the Academia Sinica (the scientific branch 
of the newly established Chinese Government) sent one of its repre- 
sentatives, Tung Tso-pin, to undertake investigations on the site. 
Early in the following year he was joined by Dr. C. Li, then on the 
field staff of the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D. C, which 
then undertook the entire cost of the excavation. Work was carried 
on through the greater part of 1929, and the Academia Sinica has 
since published two reports (in Chinese), which add considerably to 
the information which we have been able to extract from the in- 
scribed bones themselves and from the surface finds. 

' The datP ascribed by the " orthodox " chronology to W6n Waug, the father of the 
founder of the Chou Dynasty, Is 1231-1135 B. C. 



THE SHANQ DYNASTY — MENZIES 551 

It is earnestly to be hoped that the An-yang site will be carefully 
and scientifically excavated in accordance with the most approved 
modern methods; for it is the only one thus far known which gives 
us datable material for a study of the Shang Dynasty. To fail to 
treat it with the same exactness and care that are being exercised, for 
example, in the excavations at Ur or Kish in Mesopotamia, or in 
those of Megiddo or Bethshean in Palestine, w^ould be one of the 
greatest archeological losses possible, not only to China but to the 
entire civilized world. 

In addition to the inscribed bones, there are certain other literary 
sources for our interpretation of the culture of the Shang Dynasty. 
These are to be found, in part, in the very few authentic sections of 
the earlier part of the Shu Ching^ or " Book of History." The P'an 
Keng P'ien and the " Day of Supplementary Sacrifice " are the prin- 
cipal ones. These w^ere re-edited during the Confucian period, and 
thus are not entirely in their original form. But the most important 
literary sources that link up with the information yielded by the 
inscribed bones are the traditions preserved in the ancient " Bamboo 
Books " ; in the " Spring and Autumn Annals " of Lu Pu Wei ; in the 
T'ien Wen P'ien of the Ch'u Elegies; and also in that fabulous 
wonder-book, the Shan Hai Ching, or " Mountain and Sea Classic." 

In our study of the culture of the Shang Dynasty we must always 
bear in mind that the entire literary history of the period was written 
under the strict editorial censorship of scholars of the orthodox Con- 
fucian school. Many statements in the ancient records not in har- 
mony with their politico-ethical interpretation of life were deleted, as 
spurious interpolations, and an imaginary Golden Age conforming 
to their own conception of history was thus manufactured. It is this 
medley of the true and the false which has created in the minds of 
all serious students the feeling of the unreliability of early Chinese 
history. But now that we have available in collections, both those 
published and others as yet unpublished but accessible to investiga- 
tors, more than 10,000 readable bone inscriptions, all antedating the 
Chou dynasty, w^e have a reliable means of testing the literary and 
folklore source material. 

THE LANGUAGE 

Let us now turn to the language as we find it in these documents, 
which date in the main from the period between P'an Keng's removal 
of his capital to the Waste of Yin in 1396 B. C. and a time not long 
before the overthrow of the Shang Dynasty in 1122 B. C. Within 
this period of 273 years the forms of the characters show some defi- 
nite change or development; but we may say that on the whole they 
remained pictographic throughout; that is, a horse was indicated by 
the drawing of a horse, a stuck pig by that of a pig pierced a 



552 ANNUAL KEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

spear ; and so on. But ideographs were also used ; thus wei, " to do," 
is represented by a drawing of a hand guiding an elephant, just as 
the " mali " guides the elephants piling teak in Eangoon to-day ; and 
nien, " harvest " or " year," is pictured by a farmer bringing in 
sheaves of grain on his back. 

How do we determine the modern equivalents of this ancient 
script? We have no Eosetta stone such as provided the clue to the 
ancient hieroglj^phics of Egypt. We must restrict ourselves to the 
Chinese writing itself and trace the development of its characters 
down through the various periods with the aid of actual archeologi- 
cal evidence. Literary sources can not be trusted except when au- 
thenticated by actual remains. Hence we are restricted to the 
inscriptions on the bones themselves, on bronze vessels, and on stone. 
Those on the bronzes are very important, and when we have elim- 
inated the forgeries we have a valuable body of source material, 
such as the San Shih P'an, now in the Old Palace in Peiping and 
dating from about 860 B. C. Following the bronzes, we have the 
Han stone monuments, mainly in the official or li script, which show 
that the characters were first written with a brush and then carved 
in the stone. From these we may trace the evolution of the Chinese 
writing down to its present form, which has altered comparatively 
little since the beginning of the Christian Era. This development 
during the period from about 1400 B. C. down to the time of Christ 
has to do mainly with the form of character. But what of its mean- 
ing and of its sound ? At present I have catalogued all the charac- 
ters in my own collection of bones and in most of those published 
by others. For purposes of comparison I am arranging in order all 
the sentences in which a given character appears, whether on the 
bones, the bronzes, the early stone monuments, or in the classical 
literary sources. From such an arrangement of these groups of 
sentences, sometimes containing a hundred or more examples, it is 
possible through comparison and a study of the context, largely to 
fix the meaning of an individual character. In this task the reli- 
ance has been very largely on the bone inscriptions, which have thus 
been used to interpret themselves. 

As for the sound attached to the characters in the Shang Dynasty, 
to my mind this problem is to be attacked by means of the "bor- 
rowed characters" (chia chieh), where two characters having the 
same sound are used interchangeably. In the Shang period it was 
not uncommon for a simpler character to be substituted for a more 
intricate one having the same sound. During the official examina- 
tion period, when the so-called eight-legged essay was in vogue, 
a man would have been " plucked " for using a character in this way. 
Starting with this use of homophones and with the rhymes found on 
the ancient bronze bells and in the Shih Ching or " Book of Odes," 



THE SHANG DYNASTY MENZIES 553 

we have a fruitful source of information regarding the sounds of 
the ancient Shang Dynasty language. 

Let us now turn from the technical interpretation of the latter to 
some of the more obvious residts of its study. First, let us not be 
misled by the notion that because its script was pictorial, it was 
therefore in its infancy. That this was not the case is shown at once 
by the most common characters which it possesses, viz., the numerals 
and the 22 cyclical characters. These are already conventionalized 
in many cases. Thus while it is possible to see the reason for the use 
of the symbols for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 10, 1 think I am safe in saying that 
the meaning of the remaining numerals and of the»cyclical charac- 
ters is not obvious, nor is it clear what they portray. This fact 
indicates that the script was already old and conventionalized and 
that it had already undergone a long process of development before 
the fourteenth century B. C. 

Secondly, let us not allow ourselves to be carried away with the 
idea that Chinese writing, simply because of its age, had its origin 
in Sumeria. In 1929 I visited the sites of Ur and of Kish, in 
Mesopotamia, and can assure you that the most pictographic scripts 
found in those two places, dating from before 3000 B. C, are far 
more conventionalized than is our Chinese script of about 1400 B. C. 
It is inconceivable that a form of writing already well convention- 
alized before 3000 B. C. should have retrograded into a more primi- 
tive pictographic form 16 centuries later. Such similarities as exist 
are to be explained by the fact that the minds of the Shang Dynasty 
Chinese and those of the ancient Sumerians worked in similar ways. 
Such a book, for example, as C. J. Ball's " Chinese and Sumerian " 
is so defective on the side of the ancient Chinese script as to be value- 
less for purposes of comparison. 

THE CHINESE PEOPLE BEFORE THE SHANG DYNASTY 

As to the origin of the Chinese people and the relationship of the 
Shang Dynasty culture to the older prehistoric finds from northern 
China, all that our present knowledge justifies us in saying is that 
the interval between the Paleolithic Period and the fourteenth cen- 
tury B. C. is so enormous that the two fall into two entirely different 
and widely separated epochs. We are, however, sure of two very 
important points. One is, that man did exist in North China in 
very remote times, so that there is no necessity of introducing him 
from the West within the historical period. The other point is, that 
by 1400 B. C- the Chinese people had already developed a very high 
indigenous culture on the great plain of North China. 

Now Dr. J. G. Andersson has found numerous examples of a 
•' painted pottery " ware in various parts of northwestern China, 



554 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

from Kansu as far east as the village of Yang Shao, in the Province 
of Honan, just south of the Yellow River. He has dated this mate- 
rial as preceding the culture of the Shang Dynasty, perhaps by as 
much as a thousand years. And Dr. C. Li reports the finding of a 
single fragment of this painted ware in a pit which also yielded in- 
scribed bones, at the An-yang site, the " Waste of Yin." On this 
evidence, he also considers that the " painted pottery " period had its 
beginning, at least, before the founding of the Shang Dynasty. The 
pottery of the latter, as found at An-yang, is mainly either of red 
or gray monochrome or else of that fine incised white ware regarded 
as especially distinctive of that period. It is to be hoped that a 
complete excavation of this important site will throw further light 
on this and other points. 

SHANG DYNASTY HISTORY 

Over half of the inscriptions on the oracle bones are records of 
divinations or inquiries by means of the bones themselves, regarding 
the ancestral sacrifices. In them we find recorded the names of 
the ancestors to whom sacrifices were to be offered. Often a sacri- 
fice was offered to a number of ancestors in common. On one bone 
we have mention of a sacrifice to Kao Tsu (" Exalted Ancestor ") 
Wang Hai. Then follow in order three ancestors whose personal 
name was the cyclical character I : T'ai I, called T'ien I or Ch'eng 
T'ang {the founder of the dynasty) ; then Tsu I; and lastly Hsiao I. 
After these follows Father Ting, by whom is meant Wu Ting, the 
father of Tsu Keng. From such oracular records as this we can 
work out the whole ancestral line of the Shang Dynasty. Not only 
are the names of its kings given, but so also are those of its queens 
through whom the succession was passed on to the following gen- 
eration. It may be asked whether this indicates the existence of a 
matriarchate. Nothing in the line of descent seems to show this. 
Women were honored in their character of mothers, just as the 
matron of Honan to-day is most often referred to as " the mother 
of So-and-so." Several mothers are often associated with one king's 
name. Whether these were consecutive or concurrent wives does not 
appear, although there is no reason to suppose that the Shang 
Dynasty kings were monogamous. In one respect alone does the 
mother seem to take precedence in the ancestral sacrifice offered to 
her by her descendants; when a deceased king and queen receive 
a sacrifice in common, the rite is always performed on the cyclical 
birthday of the queen and not of the king. 

Succession under the Shang Dynasty was fraternal; that is, the 
kingly office passed from elder brother to younger brother, and only 



THE SHANG DYNASTY MENZIES 555 

after the members of one generation had thus had their turn did 
it devolve upon a member of the next. Wliat rule was followed in 
passing from one generation to another, we are not in a position to 
say. Sometimes the succession went to the son of the eldest brother, 
and at others to that of the youngest; but in no instance does it 
appear to have gone to a son of one of the intervening brothers. 
This type of succession is in marked contrast to that of the succeed- 
ing dynasty, that of the Chou, which was from father to son. In 
the main we may say that the line of descent worked out from the 
bone inscriptions confirms that recorded for the Shang Dynasty 
by the Chinese historical books. 

THE ORACLE BONES AND THE CLASSICS 

The inscribed bones further enable us to interpret certain signif- 
icant portions of the ancient classics, such, for example, as the 
genuine document known as " The Day of Supplementary Sacrifice." 
The orthodox view concerning this was that Tsu Chi was a minister 
of Kao Tsu Wu Ting, who was offering the supplementary sacrifice 
to Ch'eng T'ang, the founder of the Dynasty. Now, however, we 
know from the oracle records that Tsu Chi and Tsu Keng were 
brothers, the former being the elder. It was the younger, however, 
Avho was offering the supplementary sacrifice to their father Kao 
Tsu Wu Ting. How is this to be explained? From the bones as 
well as from tradition preserved in the literary sources, we learn 
the following story. King Wu Ting had three wives, named respec- 
tively Pi Hsin, Pi Wu, and Pi Kuei. By these he had three sons, 
known to later generations as Tsu Chi, Tsu Keng, and Tsu Chia. 
The eldest, Tsu Chi, was a good man; but his mother died young. 
The mother of Tsu Keng held the affections of the king, and pre- 
vailed on him to pass over Tsu Chi in the succession and place her 
son Tsu Keng on the throne. Tsu Chi made no effort to assert 
his rights, although he was a favorite among the people. Tsu 
Keng, feeling insecure on the throne, endeavored to ensure his hold 
upon it by offering excessive sacrifices to his father Wu Ting. Of 
all the oracle bones which record the sacrifices of sons to their fathers, 
those referring to the ones offered by Tsu Keng to Wu Ting far 
outnumber all the rest ; there are a hundred or more of them. 

During one of Tsu Keng's sacrifices to his father a wild pheasant 
flew into the ancestral temple, and, attracted by the seething grain 
in the bronze tripod cauldron, perched on its handle and crowed at 
the king. The latter was much frightened at this evil omen, and his 
sage elder brother, whose place on the throne he had usurped, entered 
and read him a lesson as follows : 



556 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

The former successful kings 

Were upright, and served the people. 
Heaven mirrors the people below, 

Their laws and their just rights. 
And sends down harvests in perpetuity, 

Or not in perpetuity. 
It is not that Heaven oppresses the people, 

Cutting off its divine decree in the middle, 
But that people will not follow goodness, 

Will not listen to their faults. 
Heaven has sent forth its decree 

For uprightness and good conduct. 
What will you do in regard to it? 

You, O King, must work reverently at caring for your people 
And not oppose Heaven, 

Putting at naught the laws of succession and of sacrifice 
By excessive rites at the shrine of our father. 

Tsu Chi apparently never ascended the throne. He may have 
died before Tsu Keng, who was in any case succeeded by the young- 
est brother, Tsu Chia. The latter sacrificed to his two older brothers 
together, putting Tsu Chi in his rightful place of honor above Tsu 
Keng. The succession passed not through Tsu Keng, who was so 
anxious to hold the throne, but through the son of Tsu Chia, K'ang 
Tsu Ting, who maintained the old tradition of sacrificing to his two 
deceased uncles, Tsu Chi and Tsu Keng, as fathers, according to 
one bone inscription. In another we have Tsu Chi referred to as 
Hsiao Wang, " Little King," a title which so far as I know does not 
occur in the literary sources. 

Another erroneous orthodox Confucian interpretation of an inci- 
dent recorded in the Book of History is that of P'an Keng's moving 
his capital. This was not from the north to the south of the river, 
as hitherto believed. Instead, it was from the east, near the birth- 
place of Confucius in Shantung, across the marshy river system to 
the Waste of Yin, west of the Yellow River, which then flowed 
almost due north, a few miles east of the present Peiping-Hankow 
Railway. This is apparently the reason why he was called P'an 
Keng — because he " moved house " (pan chia) ; for the character 
for " P'an " is connected with that for pan, a picture of a man 
poling a boat along a river. 

We can not here do more than mention the wars of Wu Ting, and 
his struggle against the land of Kuei Fang referred to in the I 
Ching or " Book of Changes " ; or to the intermarriage of the 
daughter of Ti I into the House of Chou. We must also pass over 
the untangling of many of the cryptic historical references in the 
I Ching, merely stating that the latter work, the material of which 
dates back to times long before Wen Wang,* seems to be one of 

* For thvs dnte of WCii Wang, or " King Wf-n," cf. footnote, 3, p. 550. 



THE SHANG DYNASTY MENZIES 557 

reference — a sort of key to the tj^pe of divination based on the oracle 
bones. A similar book, recording the historical fulfillment of 
auguries, was compiled during the Third Dynasty of Ur, in Meso- 
potamia, about 2500 B. C. There is no reference in the bone inscrip- 
tions to that later philosophical concept of the Yin and Yang (the 
Female and Male Principles in Nature), which appears to form the 
backbone of the I Ching as we have it to-day. There does seem, 
however, to be a definite relationship between the six successive 
divinations, each covering ten consecutive days in the cycle of sixty, 
and the six continuous and broken lines of the hexagrams. For in 
both bones and hexagrams, the order is from bottom to top and 
not the reverse, as one would expect. 

THE SHANG RACE BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE DYNASTY 

The Shang race naturally claimed descent from a long line of 
ancestors. Allowing 25 years to a generation, we are able to trace 
the existence of the family back to a period around 2200 B. C. 
There were undoubtedly other ancestors in the line, and in fact 
about most of them we have some historical statement in addition 
to the mere recording of their names. We have no space here to 
tell of Wang Hai and his troubles with the Yu I, or Ti as they 
were called in later times. ^ The story is given in part in a verse 
or two of the T'ien Wen P'ien of the Elegies of Ch'u, as well as in 
passages in the Shan Hai Ching, and is confirmed by the inscribed 
bones. Nor can we pause to speak of Hsiang T'u, or of Ti K'u, 
whose personal name was Chiin. It is of interest, however, to note 
that the name Chiin of his Exalted Ancestor (called Kao Tsu Chiin) 
is interpreted in the Shuo Wen dictionary as Mu Hou, or " Mother 
Monkey," as the character graphically pictures. 

THE ART AND MATERIAL CIVILIZATION OF THE SHANG DYNASTY 

Let US now turn from the history to the art of the Shang Dynasty. 
It is a common mistake to confuse the long development of the hu- 
man race with the period of historic time, or to suppose that the art 
of Egypt and Mesopotamia, or Crete and India and China, must 
have been very rude at the time when the written record begins. 
Nothing is further from the truth. This is shown, in the present 
connection, by the sculpture of the Shang Dynasty, as exemplified 
by the torso \vhich Dr. C. Li found at An-yang, and by a broken 
piece of ivory representing a coiled dragon in my own collection. 
These are superb in their execution. The jade carvings and bronze 
castings were magnificent, nnich excelling the work of any succeed- 
ing dynasty down to the present. The incised white pottery already

mentioned, of which we have now several hundred fragments," has 
never been excelled in design. And from the bits of shell, ivory, and 
semiprecious stone evidently once inlaid on wooden objects which 
have disappeared, as well as from a few examples of bronze and 
bone where the turquoise still remains, we know that the artists 
of the Shang period were no less skilled in this type of decorative 
work. On a plain pottery bowl we find a quality of line hardly 
later surpassed. So we do also on a bronze vessel, almost certainly 
of the Shang Dynasty, now in the Museum of Fine Arts at Boston. 
This, a beautiful wine pail or yin, found 30 years ago near I-chou, 
the ancient capital of Yen, has an excellence both of design and 
of material (the latter evidenced by its patination) which is not 
often exceeded. Last year (1930), while engaged in making rub- 
bings of nearly all the inscribed early bronze vessels in America, I 
identified this specimen, which was valued only for its intrinsic 
beauty and not for its historical importance. This vessel and like- 
wise the inscribed bronze halberds found near the Lai Shui "^ suggest 
that the Shang culture extended as far north as I-chou, not far from 
Peiping. 

Now in contrast note the crude design of the most important 
bronze of the Chou Dynasty which followed the Shang, that known 
as the Mao Kung Ting. Its inscription is so significant that had 
Confucius known of it, declares the scholar Wang Kuo-wei, he 
would have included it in that compilation of official records known 
as the Shu Ching, or " Book of History." Surely the recording 
of such an important inscription on a vessel of so poor a design 
marks a distinct decline in the art appreciation of the early rulers 
of the Chou Dynasty in comparison with those of the Shang who 
preceded them. 

Occidental museums and authorities unite in refusing to allow 
any bronzes to be labeled " Shang," and unfortunately the Palace 
Museum here in Peiping has followed suit. But the Shang Dynasty 
was, we know, prolific in its art; and I am convinced that many of 
our existing bronzes belong to that period. On a fragment of in- 
scribed bone which dates from the time of Tsu Kong are two im- 
portant statements : One which mentions the honorable (or valuable) 
tripod of Wu Ting ; and another which speaks of writing on bamboo 
tablets. Here we have proof that not only were costly sacrificial 
vessels in existence in the time of King Wu Ting, but also that at 
that period, in addition to the oracle records on bone, there were also 
other writings, on slips of bamboo, which, however, have unfortu- 
nately not been preserved. 

• No entire vessel appears ever to have been found.

TOTEM POLES : A KECENT NATIVE ART OF THE NORTH- 
WEST COAST OF AMERICA ^ 



By Maetus Babbbau 
National Mus&wm of Canada 



[With 6 plates] 



The totem poles of British Columbia and Alaska on the northwest 
coast of North America have long since achieved world-wide repute. 
Their decorative style at its best is unique and so effective that it is 
nowhere surpassed in excellence among the other forms of aboriginal 
art at large. They express native personality and craftsmanship in 
terms impressive and intriguing. The museums of Europe and 
America treasure a number of them, principally from the Queen 
Charlotte Islands; some adorn the parks of our western cities. 
These picturesque creations, however, can be seen to full advantage 
only in their true home, at the edge of the ocean, amid tall cedars 
and hemlocks, and in the shadow of lofty mountains. With their 
bold profiles, reminiscent of Asiatic divinities and monsters, they 
conjure impressions strangely un-American in their surroundings of 
luxuriant dark-green vegetation under skies of bluish mist. 

The art of carving poles belongs to the past. Racial customs and 
stamina are on the wane everywhere, even in their former strong- 
holds. Totem poles are no longer made. Many of them have fallen 
from old age, decayed, and disappeared. Some were sold, others 
removed in maritime raids without the consent or knowledge of the 
owners. Quite a few were destroyed by the owners themselves dur- 
ing hysterical revivals under a spurious banner of Christianity; for 
instance the poles of two Tsimsyan tribes, in the winters of 1917 
and 1918, at Gitlarhdamks and Port Simpson near the Alaskan 
frontier. 

Not even a remnant of the famous clusters of former days remains 
among the Haidas of the Queen Charlotte Islands. Barely a few 
are still left among the Bellacoolas, the Kwakiutl, and the Nootkas 
of the west coast of British Columbia ; in a few years these will have 
totally disappeared.

The only collection of poles that still remains fairly complete 
is that of the upper Skeena, in British Columbia, a short distance 
southeast of the Alaskan border, from 150 to 250 miles inland, at the 
edge of the area where this art is practiced. Nowhere else but on the 
Nass, where a number of poles also survive, are they to be seen far 
inland. The Canadian Government and the Canadian National 
Kailways a few years ago inaugurated the policy of preserving the 
Skeena Kiver poles in their original location. And the Department 
of Education of the American Government is also restoring some of 
the Tlingit poles of the Alaskan coast. 




FiouKBj 1. — The Nass and Skeena River Basins 



Well known as is this striking form of native art, one is apt to 
suppose that our enthnographic literature is well supplied with data 
on their features and history. The supposition, however, is unjusti- 
fied. Casual descriptions of poles or models of poles have been 
furnished by Doctor Swanton, Lieutenant Emmons, Doctor Boas, 
Doctor Newcombe, and others ; but their notes usually appear with- 
out the necessary historical context. It is too late now to recover 
much of this knowledge. The present writer made a complete study 
of the poles of the three Tsimsyan nations, while engaged in several 



TOTEM POLES BARBEAU 561 

ethnographic explorations on the northwest coast for the National 
Museum of Canada from 1914 to 1927; and a summary of his con- 
clusions is here presented.^ 

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TOTEM POLE 

The characteristic figures on totem poles consist of symbols com- 
parable to heraldic devices — not pagan gods or demons, as is often 
supposed. They usually illustrate myths or tribal traditions. They 
were never worshiped; and if they were held sacred, it was only 
because of their implications. 

Those of the Tsimsyan and the Tlingit in particular — and the 
same thing is also largely true of the Haida poles — were monuments 
erected by the various families in the tribe to commemorate the 
dead. In intent they were the equivalent of our tombstones. In- 
deed, the natives now have some of their crests carved out of stone 
or marble at Port Simpson or Vancouver and place them as tomb- 
stones in their modern graveyards. The owners' object in thus 
showing their coat of arms was to publish at large their claims to 
vested rights and privileges. The emblems or totems varied with 
each family; they were their exclusive property and jealously 
guarded. They picturized legends, phenomena, and the animals 
of the country. The eagle, the raven, the frog, the finback whale, 
the grizzly bear, the wolf, the thunderbird, and many others are 
among the most familiar themes. Others less frequently seen ap- 
pear to be more recent : for instance the owl, the salmon, the wood- 
pecker, the beaver, the starfish, the shark, the halibut, the bullhead, 
the split person, the mountain goat, the puma, the moon, the stars, 
and the rainbow. These symbols in the last resort were property 
marks. 

The legendary origin of the emblems is explained in traditional 
narratives that used to be recited in the winter festivals or potlatch. 
They are still remembered by the members of the older generation, 
in spite of the decay of tribal customs. They recount how the an- 
cestors long ago met with tribulations and adventures ; how they were 
harassed or rescued by spirits and monsters of the unseen regions; 
how benevolent spirits appeared in visions and invested their 
proteges with charms; and how ancient warriors conquered their 
enemies. The carved illustrations of the stories served a definite 
purpose, besides those of commemoration and ownership; they 
made familiar the legends and recollections of the past to all in 
tribal life. 

Soon after the death of a chief his prospective heirs appointed 
his leading nephew to his post. His induction took place in the

midst of a large number of invited guests during elaborate festivals, 
where liberality was an outstanding feature. The name of the uncle 
passed on to his nephew, and the erection of a totem pole crowned 
the event. Groups of related families mustered all available 
resources to make the feast memorable, as their standing and influ- 
ence depended exactly on their resources thus advantageously 
displayed. 

MAKING AND ERECTING A POLE 

The labor of cutting a large red cedar tree, hauling it overland or 
on the sea for a considerable distance, carving it, and erecting it 
often took years. The owners required sufficient time to gather 
their resources and proceeded with expenditures in installments, as 
it were. A tree was first selected and felled. The allies of the 
family interested took charge of the work — no relative could accept 
the stipend. They were fed and paid publicly at the conclusion. A 
carver was then hired also from among the allies. Should he lack 
the required skill, it was his privilege to appoint a substitute, over 
whom he stood ceremonially, assuming the credit of the work for 
himself. The carving was accomplished as secretly as possible, the 
figures being selected by the owners from their list of available 
crests, which often exceeded the fingers of one hand in number. Far 
more costly was the actual planting of the pole in the ground. A^Hien 
enough food and wealth were amassed, invitations were sent forth 
to all the leading families of the neighboring tribes; and the pole 
was erected in the presence or with the help of the hundreds of 
people gathered in festivities that were the corner stone of social life 
until about 40 years ago. 

These carved memorials as a rule face the water front, and the 
rivers or the ocean were the main highways. They stand apart from 
one another, in front of the owners' houses, and dot the whole length 
of the village in an irregular line. In recent years the villages have 
been moved to new sites, and the poles seem forsaken in the deserted 
abodes of the past. Trees have grown up around them in several 
places, and it is difficult to find them — particularly along the Nass. 

DEVELOPMENT OF THE ART OF THE TOTEM POLE 

Enough material has been retrieved from oblivion for a detailed 
history of Tsimsyan plastic art and the making of totem poles. Our 
study covers over 150 such memorials. The villages of the upper 
Skeena are the only ones that still retain some of their earlier barbaric 
features. Kispayaks, Gitsegyukla, and Kitwanga each claim about 
20 poles. Gitwinlkul now is the most remarkable of all the tribal 
villages. It stands on the Grease Trail from the Skeena to the Nass, 
claiming the largest number of poles now standing anywhere in a

single cluster — about 30 in all. It is impressive. Its poles are among 
the tallest and best ; they are also the oldest. 

It is evident that the carving of the poles was a truly popular art. 
If some artists were at times preferred to others for their skill, their 
choice for specific tasks was governed by customs largely unconcerned 
with craftsmanship. Each family of standing had every inducement 
to resort to its own carvers for important functions in ceremonial 
life. We have statistical evidence of this. The hundred totem poles 
of the upper Skeena were produced by more than 30 local carvers and 
13 foreigners. Six of the foreigners were from the Nass, and they 
had been engaged in the earliest period when the Skeena artists were 
not yet proficient in the new calling; 3 others were from the lower 
Skeena, and 4 from the Bulkley Kiver, a tributary of the Skeena. 
The Skeena carvers belonged to independent and widely scattered 
social groups or families ; that is 23 of them were of the Raven-Frog 
phratry; 9 of the Wolf, 5 of the Eagle, and 3 of the Fireweed. 
Seventy-eight out of the hundred poles are ascribed to Gitksan 
artists, while the rest are credited to foreigners. 

The art of carving and erecting memorial columns is not really as 
ancient on the northwest coast as is generally believed. Popular mis- 
conceptions that totem poles are hundreds of years old are fantastic. 
They could not be, from the nature of the materials and the climatic 
conditions. A green cedar can not stand upright much longer than 
60 or 60 years on the upper Skeena, where precipitation is moderate 
and the soil usually consists of gravel and sand. Along the coast it 
can not endure the intense moisture that prevails most of the year 
and the muskeg foundation much more than 40 years. The totem 
poles of Port Simpson, for instance, all decayed on the south side first, 
which is exposed to warm rainy winds. Most of the well-known 
poles now in our parks and museums were carved after 1860, while 
not a few of those seen in Indian villages, such as Alert Bay. were 
erected after 1890. 

The growth of native technique to its present state is largely 
confined to the past century. It hinged upon European tools — the 
steel ax, the adze, and the curved knife — which were traded off in 
large numbers to the natives from the days of the early circum- 
navigators — that is after 1778. The lack of suitable tools, of wealth, 
and of leisure in the prehistoric period precluded the elaboration of 
ambitious structures and displays. The benefits accruing from the 
fur trade at once stimulated local ambitions; they stirred up jeal- 
ousies and rivalries and incited incredible efforts for higher prestige 
and leadership. The totem pole came into fashion after 1830 through 
the rise of these ambitions. The size of the pole and the beauty of 
its figures published abroad the fame of those it represented.

Feuds over the size of poles at times broke out between semi- 
independent leaders within a village. The bitter quarrel between 
Hlaclerh and Sispegoot, on the Nass, will not soon be forgotten, 
Hladerh, head chief of the Wolves, would not allow the erection of 
any pole that exceeded his own in height, Sispegoot, head chief of 
the Finback Whales, could afford to disregard his rival's jealousy. 
When his new pole was carved, more than 60 years ago, the news 
went out that it would be the tallest in the village. In spite of 
HIaderh's repeated warnings, Sispegoot issued invitations for its 
erection. But he was shot and wounded by Hladerh as he passed 
in front of his house in a canoe. The festival was perforce post- 
poned for a year. Meanwhile Hladerh managed, through a clever 
plot, to have Sispegoot murdered by one of his own subordinates. 
He later compelled another chief of his own phratry, much to his 
humiliation, to shorten his pole twice after it was erected; and he 
was effectively checked only when he tried to spread his rule abroad 
to an upper Nass village. 

The present crop of poles is the first of its kind to stand on the 
Skeena, with the exception of a few of the oldest that have already 
fallen and decayed. The oldest poles of Gitsegyukla (at Skeena 
Crossing) have stood only since the fire destroyed the earlier village 
in 1872 ; those of Hazelton were carved after the establishment of the 
Indian reserve about 1892. But several of the poles in the other 
villages — including Kitwanga — are many years older; they are 
particularly interesting, as they illustrate the growth of totem pole 
carving within two or three generations in the nineteenth century. 

Most of the poles of the upper Skeena were erected in the past 
40 or 50 years. The oldest five or six may slightly exceed 70 years 
of age. Not a few are less than 30 years old. It is safe to say that 
this feature of native life among the Gitksan became fashionable 
only after 1870 and 1880. Only 6 out of nearly 30 poles at Gitwinl- 
kul — the earliest of these villages to adopt the art — exceed 50 years 
of age; and only a few poles at that time stood in the neighboring 
villages. 

TECHNIQUE AND ITS EVOLUTION 

Native accounts and the evidence of the carved memorials lead 
to the conclusion that, among the Tsimsyan, carved house-front poles 
and house-corner posts were introduced first, many years before the 
first detached columns appeared. Several houses and posts of this 
kind are still remembered by the elders and have been described; 
a few are still to be observed, particularly at the lower canyon of the 
Skeena, though most of them are in an advanced state of decay. 
The archaic stvle of house decoration was abandoned as soon as the 



TOTEM POLES BAEBEAU 565 

natives gave up building large communal lodges in the purely native 
manner, and memorial columns that could no longer serve as cere- 
monial doorways, or traps, became the new fashion. Some of the 
upper Skeena villages, indeed, never adopted the fashion wholesale; 
at least four of them boasted of no more than a few poles, and part 
of these were put up only after 1890. 

Internal evidence tells the same tale. The technique of carving 
on several of the oldest poles on the upper Skeena discloses anterior 
stages in the art. It is essentially the technique of making masks or 
of carving small detached objects ; or, again, of representing masked 
and costumed performers as they appeared in festivals rather than 
the real animals or objects as they exist in nature. These early 
Skeena River carvers had not yet acquired the skill of their Nass 
River masters, who had advanced to the point of thinking of a large 
pole as an architectural unit that called for harmony of decorative 
treatment. 

Haesem-hliyawn and Hlamee, of Gitwinlkul, represent distinctive 
periods of the craft among the Gitksan. To Haesem-hliyawn goes 
the credit of carving some of the best poles in existence. He lived as 
late as 1868, while Hlamee, his junior and follower, died after 1900. 

The style of Haesem-hliyawn was of the finest, in the purely 
native vein. He combined a keen sense of realism with a fondness 
for decorative treatment. His art sought inspiration in nature, 
while maintaining itself within the frontiers of ancient stylistic 
technique, Haesem-hliyawn belonged to the generation wherein the 
totem pole art was still in its growth (1840-1880) and all at once 
reached its apogee. His handling of human figures counts among 
the outstanding achievements of west coast art — indeed, of aborig- 
inal art in any part of the world. The faces he carved, with their 
pronounced expression and amusing contortions, are characteristic 
of the race. 

Hlamee, a prolific worker, introduced the white man's paint to 
enhance the features of his carvings. While he used paint with 
discretion and to good effect, it immediately lessened the sculptural 
quality of the work. The new fashion did not compensate for the 
evident loss of native inspiration and artistry. 

The carved poles of the Nass maintain a much higher average 
standard of art than those of the Skeena; but they are less numerous, 
for the reason that the Nass people gave up their ancient customs 
much earlier than the Kitksan — that is 40 or 50 years ago. The 
technique of pole carving in both areas represents well the passage 
from the earlier and better art of the Haesem-hliyawn type to that 
of Hlamee. 

The Tsimsyan of the lower Skeena, on the other hand, never were 
devoted to the art of carving totem poles. Wlien they were moved 



566 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

long ago to commemorate a historical event of first magnitude, 
they erected a tall slab of stone. If the Tsimsyan proper as a body 
were not swayed by the modern fashion of erecting carved memo- 
rials to their dead, they retained until fairly late the older custom of 
painting in native pigments their heraldic symbols on the front of 
their houses. While not a single totem pole seems ever to have 
stood in the village of Gitsees, near the mouth of the Skeena, five 
house- front paintings were still clearly remembered and described 
a few years ago. And it was related that many houses in the neigh- 
boring tribes were decorated in this style, which at one time may 
have been fairly general along the coast. 

The remarkable west coast custom of carving and erecting house 
poles and tall mortuary columns or of painting coats of arms on 
house fronts is sufficiently uniform in type to suggest that it origi- 
nated in a single center and thence spread outward in various direc- 
tions. The limits of its distributions coincide with those of the west 
coast art proper which embrace the carving or painting of wood, 
leather, stone, bone, and ivory. 

This art itself seems much more ancient in some of its smaller 
forms than in its larger ones. Its origin on the northwest coast is 
remote. It goes back to prehistoric times. It was already in existence 
and fully mature and quite as conventionalized as it is today at the 
time of the early Spanish, English, and French explorers (1775-1800) . 
Most of the early circumnavigators — Cook, Dixon, Meares, Vancou- 
ver, Marchand, and La Perouse — give ample evidence that masks, 
chests, ceremonial objects were at the end of the last century deco- 
rated in the style now familiar to us. They also mention that house 
fronts were decorated with painted designs. There is, however, a 
striking lack of evidence everywhere as to the existence of totem 
poles proper or detached memorial columns, either south or north. 
For instance, Dixon examined several of the Haida villages on the 
Queen Charlotte Islands ; but he fails to mention totem or even house 
poles, even though he minutely described small carved trays and 
spoons. 

But there were already, from 1780 to 1800, some carved house 
posts in existence. Captain Cook ^ observed a few carved posts inside 
the house of some chiefs at Nootka Sound, where he wintered in 
1780; and Webster, his artist, reproduced the features of two of 
them in his sketches. Meares, in 1788 and 1789, observed like Nootka 
carvings in the same neighborhood, which he describes thus : " Three 
enormous trees, rudely carved and painted, formed the rafters, which 
were supported at the ends and in the middle by gigantic images, 

» Cook, James, A voyage to the Pacific Ocean, vol. 2, p. 317. 3 vols., London, 1784. 



TOTEM POLES BAEBEAU 567 

carved out of huge blocks of timber." * And he calls them elsewhere 
" misshapen figures." The earliest drawing of a carved pole is that 
of a house frontal or entrance pole (not a real totem pole) of the 
Haidas; and it is found in Bartlett's Journal, 1790.^ 

ORIGIN OF THE TOTEM POLE ART 

The custom of carving and erecting mortuary columns to honor 
the dead is therefore modern, that is post-Columbian; it may exceed 
slightly the span of the last century. In spite of this, it is not easy 
to trace back its origin to its very birthplace. Even the simple poles 
of the Nootkas as described by Cook are not likely in themselves to 
represent a form of native art of the stone age in its purely aboriginal 
state, undisturbed b}' foreign influences. Iron and copper tools at 
that date were already in the possession of the natives; and they 
were used everywhere as only they could be by expert craftsmen 
through lifelong habit. The west coast at that date was no longer 
unchanged. The Russians had discovered it many decades before, 
and the Spanish had left more recent traces of their passage. More- 
over, the influence of the French and the English had crossed the 
continent through contacts between intermediate tribes and the arri- 
val of halfbreeds and coureurs de bois west of the mountain passes. 
From our records of exploration and adventure it appears certain 
that the northwest coast people were accessible to foreign influence 
for more than 200 years, to say the least. The natives themselves 
were highly amenable to foreign influence. Nowhere in America 
did they show more avidity or greater skill to acquire and utilize 
from the sundry goods and crafts of the white man whatever suited 
their needs. 

Precisely where the totem poles, or mortuary columns, first ap- 
peared and at exactly what moment is an interesting though elusive, 
point. Our evidence eliminates the Gitksan, or the Tsimsyan proper, 
from among the possibilities. Evidence abundantly shows that the 
Nass River tribes made totem poles at an earlier period than the 
upper Skeena people. Many families on both sides are mutually 
related. Several of the Gitwinlkul villagers have their hunting 
grounds on the upper Nass; and the Gitksan used to travel every 
spring to the lower Nass for eulachan fishing or to trade pelts or 
dried fruit cakes with the coast tribes. In the course of time a strong 
cultural influence from the more progressive tribes of the coast thus 
resulted.

Likewise the tribes farther south can not be considered. The 
Bellabellas were painters rather than carvers. The Kwakiutl and 
the Nootka plastic art always remained very crude compared with 
that of the northern nations; and, besides, it reveled in grotesque 
forms by preference. It seldom was at the service of heraldry 
as in the north, heraldry being of minor import on the coast 
south of the Skeena. Totem poles among the Kwakiutl and the 
Nootka are all very recent; not many of them, as they are currently 
known, may antedate 1880. The most familiar of the Kwakiutl poles, 
those of Alert Bay, were all carved and erected since 1890. None 
of them stood at the time when the late C. F. Newcombe visited the 
village at that date. 

At first sight it seems more likely that the Tlingit, of the southern 
Alaskan frontier, might have initiated the custom of erecting me- 
morials to the dead. They were closer to the Russian headquarters 
and must have been among the first to obtain iron tools. There is no 
doubt, besides, that they were most skillful carvers and weavers, 
through the whole local evolution of these crafts. Yet there are good 
reasons why the credit for originating totem poles should not fall 
to their lot. The early circumnavigators that called at some of their 
villages made no mention of large carvings that we know, not even 
of such house or grave posts as they observed among the Haidas far- 
ther south. From a keen and experienced observer of these people, 
Lieut. G. T. Emmons, who was stationed on the Alaskan coast for 
many years in an official capacity, we learn that the northern half of 
the Tlingit nation never had totem poles until very recently; and 
the few of those that have sprung up in that district within the scope 
of his observation are the property of a family or families that origi- 
nally belonged to the southern tribes and have retained their southern 
affiliations. 

The Haidas must next be dismissed from consideration as likely 
originators of the art. The Haida poles, as we know them, are partly 
house poles and partly totem poles proper; the former far more 
numerous proportionally than among the Tsimsyan. Indeed, almost 
none of the present Nass River carvings were house poles. The two 
large posts observed among the Haidas by Bartlett and Marchand 
in 1788-1792 were house portals. Though the Haida villages were 
often visited at the end of the eighteenth century and in the first part 
of the nineteenth, we find no other reference to large poles, still less 
to the famous rows of poles at Massett and Skidegate as they were 
photographed about 1880. The Haida poles as we know them in our 
museums are all of the same advanced type of conventionalism, all 
of the same period, that is 1830-1880, and presumably all from 
the hands of carvers that were contemporaries. They were from 10 



TOTEM POLES BAEBEAU 569 

to 30 years old when the Haidas became converts to Christianity and 
in consequence gave up their customs, cut down their poles, and sold 
them to white people about the year 1890 or afterwards. It is a 
common saying, however inaccurate it may be, that the fine row of 
poles in one of their best-known towns had risen from the proceeds 
of an inglorious type of barter in Victoria. There is no evidence of 
mortuary poles among the Haidas antedating 1840 or 1850, though a 
few earlier and transitional ones may have served to introduce the 
fashion. 

The probabilities are that totem poles proper originated among 
the Nisrae or northern Tsimsyan of the Nass River. It is evident, 
from traditional recollections, that the custom of thus commemorat- 
ing the dead is not very ancient among them; yet it certainly ante- 
dated that of the Gitksan or the Tsimsyan. It is far more likely 
that the Haidas and the Tlingit imitated them than the reverse. 
The estuary of the Nass was the most important thoroughfare of 
Indian life in all the northern parts. Eulachan fishing in the neigh- 
borhood of what is now called Fishery Bay near Gitrhateen, the 
largest Nisrae center, was a dominant feature in native life. The 
grease from the eulachan, or candlefish, was a fairly universal and 
indispensable staple along the coast. For the purpose of securing 
their supply of it the Haidas, the Tlingit, the Tsimsyan, and the 
Gitksan traveled over the sea or the inland trails every spring and 
camped in several temporary villages of their own from Red Bluffs 
eastwards on the lower Nass, side by side, for weeks at a time. Dur- 
ing these yearly seasons exchanges of all kinds — barter, social ameni- 
ties, or feuds — were quite normal. As a result, cultural features of 
the local hosts — whether they w^ere willing hosts or not is an open 
question — were constantly under the observation of the strangers 
and were often a cause for envy or aggression. It is doubtful, on 
the other hand, whether the Tsimsyan ever traveled to the Queen 
Charlotte Islands or the Tlingit country unless to make a raid or 
an occasional visit to relatives. 

It is agreed among specialists that the Nass River carvers were 
on the whole the best in the country. Their art reached the highest 
point of development ever attained on the northwest coast. And 
their totem poles — more than 20 of which can still be observed in 
their original location — are the best and among the tallest seen any- 
where. The Haida poles are stilted, conventional, and offer little 
variety in comparison. It is noteworthy, besides, that the Tlingit 
poles resemble in character those of the Nass River. And the Nisrae 
assert that a number of totem poles at Tongas (Cape Fox), the 
southernmost of the Tlingit villages, Avere the w^ork of their carvers 
within the memory of the passing generation. 



570 ANNUAL EEPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

The close similarities between the plastic arts of the northwest 
coast and those of the various people around the edges of the Pacific 
Ocean should not be overlooked. Common features in the art and 
technology of our coast natives and the Polynesians, for instance, are 
too persistently alike in some aspects to be unrelated, at least in some 
remote way. The early navigators noticed, about 1780-1790, the 
striking resemblance between the fortresses of the Haidas and other 
coast tribes and the " hippah " of the New Zealand natives. Totem 
poles, as fairly recently carved and erected on both sides of the 
Pacific, offer the same compelling resemblance. Their technique of 
erection, besides, was identical. It will gradually become an estab- 
lished conclusion, we believe, that much of the growth of native crafts 
in wood carving and decoration as now exemplified in the museums 
of the world is far more recent than is generally believed.

BROBDINGNAGIAN BRIDGES 



By Othmar H. Ammann 



[With 7 plates] 



A hundred years ago it was predicted that the famous bridge across 
the Menai Straits in England, with a span of 570 feet, would forever 
constitute a world wonder. Only 50 years later that maximum 
length of span was more than doubled and the suspended mass in- 
creased tenfold in the Brooklyn Bridge across the East River in 
New York. And if we compare Brooklyn Bridge, which 50 years 
ago was by far the most outstanding engineering work of its kind, 
with the George Washington Bridge in New York now nearing com- 
pletion, we find that the span length in the last 50 years has been 
again more than doubled, the traffic capacity multiplied at least four 
times, and the total mass suspended over the river more than eight 
times. 

It is also of interest to note that in spite of this enormous increase in 
the mass and quantity of material in the George Washington Bridge, 
the time of construction will be less than one-half that consumed by 
the Brooklj^n Bridge, and that the total cost, in proper consideration 
of the depreciation of the purchase value of money, will be less than 
twice that consumed by the much smaller Brooklyn Bridge. These 
results have, of course, been made possible only by the far-reaching 
developments in other technical lines, such as mechanical and electri- 
cal engineering, and metallurgy, as well as in the field of theory and 
experiment. 

From the engineering or technical point of view, progress in bridge 
construction manifests itself in improved types and forms of con- 
struction and details, in better and stronger materials, in more accu- 
rate and cheaper shopwork, and in more expeditious and safer erec- 
tion, all of which are essential for the construction of larger bridges. 
It is principally along these lines that I desire to illustrate progress 
made in recent years. 

TYPES OF BRIDGES 

The selection of the type or form of bridge to be used for an;j^ 
particular crossing is, from the engineering point of view, one of the

572 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

most important factors in the construction of large bridges, and is 
a question which has often led to animated discussions and differences 
of opinions in the profession. It is a question which depends upon 
many different factors and not in the least upon the personal con- 
ceptions of the designer. 

At the beginning of this century and up to as late as the World 
War, two types of bridges appeared to be particularly favored, 
although they are generally the least satisfactory from the esthetic 
point of view : the cantilever bridge for the longer spans and the 
simple span truss type for the lesser span lengths of up to 700 feet. 
The most outstanding example of the former type is the Quebec 
Bridge across the St. Lawrence River with a main span of 1,800 feet, 
which until recently has been the longest span in existence. The 
longest simple span is that of the bridge across the Mississippi at 
Metropolis with a length of 720 feet (pi. 5, fig. 2). 

Many bridges of the cantilever type have been built across the 
Ohio, Mississippi, and other wide streams. To the most recent and 
typical examples belong the two bridges built by the Port of New 
York Authority across the Arthur Kill in New York. The type 
is particularly suitable where foundation conditions make other 
types expensive or subject to the effect of possible settlements. 
But its merits, particularly the alleged advantage of its being stati- 
cally determinate, have been overrated. 

For a long period there existed a very general prejudice against 
the so-called continuous truss, so much so that, in spite of its eco- 
nomic advantages, it was practically excluded from consideration in 
favor of the simple truss or the cantilever. Its application in 1916 
in the bridge across the Ohio at Sciotoville with two spans of 775 
feet each marked a revival of that meritorious type and it has since 
been employed in quite a number of bridges (pi. 4, fig. 1). 

Less frequently, and only under favorable circumstances, such 
as the presence of rocky abutments to resist its thrust, has the arch 
type been used. Until the present the famous Hell Gate Bridge, 
completed in 1917, across the East River in New York with a span 
of nearly 1,000 feet has been the most outstanding example, but it 
is now being outranked by two bridges, both now nearing comple- 
tion ; namely, that across the entrance to Sydney Harbor in Australia 
with a span of 1,650 feet, and that across the Kill van Kull in New 
York with a span of 1,675 feet. 

The suspension bridge is the type eminently suited for long 
spans and is now recognized as the only one to be considered for 
very long spans. The true nature of this naturally graceful type 
has long been misunderstood and it is only very recently that it 



BRIDGES AMMANN 573 

has begun to regain the prominent position which it occupied in 
the earl}'^ part of the nineteenth century. A large number of 
bridges of this type, particuhirly for highway and combined high- 
way and rapid transit rail traffic, have been built in the last 10 or 
15 years, even with moderate spans, and its greatest length of span 
has been continuously leaping to new records. 

The Manhattan Bridge in New York with a span of 1,470 feet 
was the most outstanding modern suspension bridge only 10 years 
ago. Since then there followed in rapid succession the Bear Moun- 
tain Bridge across the Hudson with a 1,630-foot span, the Delaware 
River Bridge in Philadelphia with 1,750 feet, the Detroit River 
Bridge with 1,850 feet and now the George Washington Bridge near- 
ing comjDletion with 3,500 feet. And a start has been made on the 
Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco with a span of 4,200 feet. 

A factor wdiich, I believe, has very materially contributed to the 
revival of the suspension bridge, is the changed conception regarding 
the proportioning of the so-called stiffening system of this type. As 
a result of the insufficient rigidity of many of the early light and 
short suspension bridges it became a general practice here and abroad 
to proportion suspension systems as rigid systems, such as the truss 
or the upright arch. This theory leads to enormous waste of material 
in long-span suspension bridges, more particularly those bridges 
carrying highway or mixed highway and rail traffic, because it does 
not take into consideration the stiffening effect of the large suspended 
mass, compared to the relatively much smaller load units which 
cause the span to sag or oscillate. Conspicuous stiffening systems 
also give an unsightly, clumsy appearance to such bridges and destroy 
the gracefulness of the cables hanging in their natural catenary. 

To-day the justification of a flexible, more economical, and more 
graceful stiffening system in long and heavy suspension bridges is 
generally recognized. Studies made in connection with the George 
Washington Bridge indicated that such a long span of 3,500 feet, with 
comparatively short side spans, designed to carry vehicular and rapid 
transit traffic, required practically no stiffening of the freely sus- 
pended cables. Accordingly, the bridge was designed and is being 
built without any stiffening wdiatsoever in its initial stage, in which 
only the upper deck for highway traffic will be in place. When the 
lower deck for rapid transit rail traffic is added, it will have com- 
paratively flexible, very light stiffening trusses between the two decks. 

When it is considered that in such a long span every pound of 
steel unnecessarily applied for stiffening is merely ballast, and that 
this pound of useless material requires the use of another pound of 
material in the cables, towers, and anchorages it may be realized that 
such wasteful proportioning involves millions of dollars.

QUALITY OF MATERIALS 

An important phase in the development of long span bridge build- 
ing is the improvement of the materials, more particularly the intro- 
duction of so-called high strength alloy steels, for high strength 
material does not only effect a reduction in the dead weight which in 
large bridges may mean a saving of millions of dollars, but it makes 
possible certain structural members and connections of large propor- 
tions which would be impracticable with ordinary steel. For riveted 
members and connections a medium hard structural steel of from 
55,000 to 70,000 pounds per square inch is still generally used for 
ordinary bridges. 

About 25 years ago nickel steel, which has a strength of about 50 
per cent greater than the ordinary steel, was introduced and found 
increasing application in large bridges, as for instance in the Quebec 
Cantilever Bridge, in the stiffening trusses of the Manhattan Bridge, 
and also in a number of long simple span trusses. 

During and after the World War silicon steel entered the field in 
sharp competition with nickel steel. Its strength is about 40 per cent 
greater than ordinary steel or about 7 per cent less than nickel steel, 
but it can be manufactured at a materially smaller cost than the 
latter. In fact, its cost has now been so reduced that it can be used 
economically even in bridges of medium size in place of ordinary 
steel. The towers and floor structure of the George Washington 
Bridge are built almost entirely of silicon steel. 

In the case of the Bayonne Bridge with its exceptional span of 
1,675 feet, manganese steel was introduced for the heavy main arch 
ribs. Its strength is equivalent to that of nickel steel, but its price 
was slightly less. In this same bridge there was also used for the 
first time manganese steel for the rivets with a strength of about 60 
per cent in excess of that of ordinary steel rivets. 

For suspension bridges in particular the marked improvement in 
quality of wire steel was of importance. Since the construction of 
the Brooklyn Bridge in which steel wire of 160,000 pounds per square 
inch strength was used for the first time in place of the earlier 
wrought-iron wire, the strength of wire successively stepped up to a 
new record in almost each new large bridge until it has now reached 
a strength of nearly 240,000 pounds per square inch in the cables of 
the George Washington Bridge. 

The question is frequently asked. What would be the maximum 
practical length of span? The answer to this depends essentially 
upon the quality of steel wire. With the quality now available it 
would be structurally feasible to build suspension spans of up to 
about 10,000 feet in length. Such a span, of course, would be ex- 
tremely costly and probably nowhere justified financially. 



BRIDGES — AMMANN 575 

SHOP FABRICATION 

In the fabrication of structural steel members in the shops impor- 
tant improvements have been made in the past 20 years "which were 
essential for the building of large bridges. Inaccuracies in the 
fabrication of steel members were largely responsible for the failure 
of the Quebec Bridge in 1907. Since then more accurate methods 
and powerful nuichines have been introduced so that in the present- 
day large bridges a remarkable degree of accuracy is being obtained. 
Thus, for instance, the towers of the George Washington Bridge were 
erected with an accuracy of three-sixteenths inch in a height of 600 
feet, and the l,6T5-foot arch span of the Bayonne Bridge was closed 
with a difference of one-half inch from the theoretical length. 

To-day individual members of greater size and weight are being 
completely assembled in the shops. While 30 years ago members 
of 25 to 30 tons weight were exceptional, the weight attained to-day 
is not infrequently 80 to 100 tons and in a few cases 150 tons. The 
accurate fitting together of connecting members is also being given 
great care to-day. In some cases whole trusses, or large portions 
thereof, have been completely assembled at the shops. 

FIELD ERECTION 

When we compare the present day erection of large bridges with 
that of 20 or 30 years ago, we notice two striking improvements; 
the speed with which enormous masses of steel for large bridges as 
well as buildings are being assembled in the field, and the avoidance 
of cumbersome falsework and erection equipment. The structures 
often appear during construction as if they were erecting themselves, 
and this is literally the fact to the extent that frequently members of 
the final structure proper are being used to lift or temporarily sup- 
port other members or parts of the structure. Where falsework is 
unavoidable, it is almost invariably built of steel members which 
are often members of the permanent structure. 

Erection of bridges by the so-called cantilever method with or 
without partial use of false work, is very common to-day, not only 
for cantilever bridges, but for simple and continuous trusses and for 
arches. The absence of false work of any kind is particularly strik- 
ing in the erection of the towers of suspension bridges. A simple 
frame carrying the erection derricks and lifting itself up along the 
completed portion of the tower is the only temporary structure. 

The erection of the wire cables in America is accomplished by the 
old and well-tried method of " aerial spinning," in which the indi- 
vidual wires are pulled from one anchorage to the other over the 
towers. Then, packed in bundles or strands, the wires are lifted 



576 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19 31 

from temporary into final position in the cable and finally the cable 
is compacted into cylindrical form and wrapped with a layer of 
finer wire (pi. 3, fig. 1). While the principle of this method is an 
old one, having been used already 50 years ago in the Brooklj^n 
Bridge, the machinery and equipment necessary for the spinning 
have undergone radical improvements which have resulted in greater 
accuracy and speed of erection. 

THEORY AND RESEARCH 

Advances in theory and extensive research work have aided 
materially the construction of large bridges, in fact, refinements in 
theory and experiments are called for and justified mainly in con- 
nection with structures of unusual size. The refinements in theory 
include the elaborate calculation of secondary stresses of all kinds, 
stresses which are usually neglected in ordinary structures, but 
whose magnitude it is well to determine, and where necessary pro- 
vide for, in larger ones. Such elaborate calculations were carried 
out in connection with the Hell Gate Bridge, the George Washington 
Bridge, and more extensively in the Bayonne Bridge. 

Stress determinations by calculation are now being supplemented 
by stress measurements on models. In order to check the highly 
statically indeterminate stresses in the towers of the George Washing- 
ton Bridge a celluloid model 6 feet high of one of the tower bents 
was constructed and the stresses were measured by means of very 
sensitive extensometers. For the Bayonne Bridge a complete model 
of the main arch was built of brass, loaded in various manners ver- 
tically as well as horizontally and the stresses measured by exten- 
someter. A complete model of the Mount Hope Suspension Bridge 
was recently built by Professor Beggs of Princeton and the stresses 
in it measured with excellent results. 

As a further means to check the theory, stress measurements by 
extensometers on the actual structure have been undertaken. Such 
measurements are now in progress in certain parts of the George 
Washington Bridge and more extensively in the Bayonne Bridge. 

Finally, in order to gain further knowledge of the actual be- 
havior of large-sized members and connections when loaded to de- 
struction, a series of such strength tests have been undertaken. In 
connection with the George Washington and Baj^onne Bridges, for 
instance, compression tests were made of a number of columns of 
various materials and of the largest sizes ever tested, taxing the 10,- 
000,000-pound testing machine of the Bureau of Standards in Wash- 
ington to its capacity. Many tests of large-size riveted connections 
have also been made in recent years.

ESTHETICS 

Besides the technical advance in bridge construction we may record 
welcome developments with respect to the esthetic side. While engi- 
neers generally are possessed of a strong sense of utility and are 
inclined to justify the appearance of any structure from the economic 
and scientific point of view, there is a marked recognition of the de- 
mand of public opinion that proper esthetic treatment be given to 
our public structures, and that the collaboration of the architect who 
is trained and better qualified to develop esthetic forms and archi- 
tectural embellishments is essential for that purpose. 

In large bridges, of course, the principal lines and proportions of 
the structure must be determined by the engineer, for they are, to 
a large extent, dictated by the fundamentals of strength and stability 
and by local geographical and topographical conditions. Within 
certain limits, however, the engineer must and can apply his own 
sense of beauty in determining them. But it is often essential, in 
order to improve the general appearance of a structure, to mask or 
supplement certain crude engineering features by architectural em- 
bellishments, the design of which must be left to the architect. It is 
by such collaboration between engineer and architect that some of 
our modern large bridges have progressed beyond the field of purely 
utilitarian and scientific structures.

ALBERT ABRAHAM MICHELSON 



By Forest R. Moulton 



[With one plate] 



On May 9, 1931, in his seventy-ninth year and at the zenith of his 
fame, Albert Abraham Michelson died. As the news of his death was 
spread by telegraph and cable, the whole world acclaimed his incom- 
prehensible genius ; but his intimate acquaintances mourned and still 
mourn the loss of a friend who was gentle and wholly without 
affectation. 

No scientist of the present day has had a more romantic life than 
that of Michelson. As a small child, his parents brought him to the 
United States from Strelno, Germany, where he was born on Decem- 
ber 19, 1852. His school days were spent in San Francisco, Calif. 
In 1869, at the age of 17 years, he made a journey alone across the 
continent to Washington in order to apply personally to President 
Grant for an appointment as a cadet in the United States Naval 
Academy at Annapolis, Md. Since genius has a habit of recognizing 
its kind, he received the appointment. He graduated in 1873 and 
became a midshipman in the United States Navy. From 1875 to 
1879, inclusive, he was an instructor in physics and chemistry in the 
Naval Academy ; in 1880 he served on the staff of the Nautical Alma- 
nac, in Washington ; from 1881 to 1888 he studied in Berlin, Heidel- 
berg, and Paris ; he was professor of physics in Case School of Ap- 
plied Science, in Cleveland, Ohio, from 1883 to 1889; from 1889 to 
1892 he was a professor in Clark University, in Worcester, Mass.; 
and in 1892 he answered President W. R. Harper's call to join the 
new adventures in research, scholarship, and education which were 
then being started on the Midway, in Chicago. Until his retire- 
ment in 1927, he was head of the department of physics in the Uni- 
versity of Chicago and he was the first distinguished service professor 
in the university. 

Many of the great scientific societies of the world elected Michelson 
to their membership. Moreover, he received numerous prizes and 
medals, among which were the Copley medal of the Royal Society

and the Nobel prize for physics, in 1927, in each case the first granted 
to an American. Many universities, both American and foreign, hon- 
ored themselves by bestowing upon him honorary degrees. He was 
president of the American Physical Society, in 1901-3 ; of the Ameri- 
can Association for the Advancement of Science, in 1910-11; and of 
the National Academy of Sciences, in 1923-1927. 

Dates and lists of honors do not really constitute biography ; at the 
most they form a framework on which may be hung a more or less 
adequate picture of an individual. No intimate friend of Michelson 
ever thought of him in terms of high positions or great honors. To 
me he was like the sea on a summer's day — serene, illimitable, un- 
fathomable. This was not a superficial impression, for I knew him 
intimately for more than 25 years. On scores of occasions I played 
tennis with him and against him; on a larger number of occasions 
I played billiards with him. I accompanied him to tennis champion- 
ships, to billiard matches, and once we occupied ring side seats at 
a professional wrestling match. Often we took lunch together ; many 
times I called on him in his simple office in Ryerson Laboratory. 

I said that to me Michelson was like a serene sea. He was un- 
hurried and unfretful. He was never rushed by university duties; 
he never drove himself to complete a laborious task ; he never feared 
that science, the university, or mankind was at a critical turning 
point; he never trembled on the brink of a great discovery. He 
gave the impression of the serenity of illimitable breadth and un- 
fathomable depth. Tliough one had a feeling that the depths on 
occasion might be disturbed by a storm, I never heard him raise his 
voice above its accustomed level. 

There are doubtless many motives that inspire men to scientific 
achievements. If I have correctly caught the dominant note of his 
life, Michelson was moved only by the esthetic enjoyment his work 
gave him. In everything he did, whether it was work or play, he 
was an artist. His coordination was so perfect and his touch was so 
deft that there was more satisfaction in being defeated by him 
at billiards than in winning from another opponent. I recall with 
what pleasure Professor Sargent, of the art department, used to 
watch the gracefulness of his playing. Michelson was an artist also 
in the more ordinary sense of the word, for he was a skillful amateur 
performer on the violin and his water colors were a delight. And 
often at luncheon on the back of a menu card he would sketch the 
profile of a colleague. But all these expressions of his artistic nature 
were in private and purely for his own pleasure, and many of his 
friends were quite unaware that he had these accomplishments. 

Michelson's art was also manifested in his experiments, even in 
the first experiment he performed, that of measuring the velocity of 
light as a class demonstration, at Annapolis. With his hastily con- 



MICHELSON MOULTON 581 

structed apparatus he secured results of a higher order of accuracy 
than any that had theretofore been attained. Much of his scientific 
work throughout his long life related to light, and his last experi- 
ment, completed just before his death, was an extraordinarily ac- 
curate measurement of its velocity. In all of his experiments he 
exhibited an uncanny ability to make apparatus work. For example, 
after French physicists thought they had proved both theoretically 
and experimentally that interference phenomena could not be se- 
cured in white light, he set up in Paris his recently invented inter- 
ferometer with the materials that happened to be available and aston- 
ished the French scientists with its performance. For the purpose 
of measuring short distances or small angles, the interferometer is 
incomparably superior to the microscope. An outgrowth of this 
early instrument is his later stellar interferometer with which in 
recent years the diameters of several stars have been measured. 

Early in his scientific career Michelson, in association with E. W. 
Morley, performed an experiment which marks a turning point in the 
philosophy of physical science. To the mass of mankind the sur- 
face of the earth appears fixed, but to the astronomer the earth is a 
tiny globe which spins on its axis and revolves about the sun. If 
one should be tempted to conclude that motion w^ith respect to the 
sun is absolute, astronomers would inform him that the sun moves 
with respect to the stars; and recently it has been found that our 
galaxy is moving with respect to exterior galaxies. 

In 1887 Michelson and Morley undertook to measure the motion of 
the earth, not with respect to the sun, or our galaxy, or exterior 
galaxies, but with respect to the ether, an assumed all-pervading 
medium through which light is transmitted and which, if anything, 
would give absolute motion. The quantity to be determined was so 
minute that it could be measured only with the aid of Michelson's 
interferometer. To the astonishment of scientists no certain motion 
of the earth with respect to the assumed ether was found. Though 
light has the properties of wave motion, it appears to be propagated 
with a speed which is independent of the motion of its source. 

Einstein's theory of relativity has its roots in the Michelson-Mor- 
ley experiment. All the changes in point of view it has introduced 
into physics and astronomy rest upon the experiment carried out in 
Cleveland in 1887, and upon the subsequent verification of its sur- 
prising results. Whatever modifications the theory of relativity 
may undergo and whatever may be its ultimate fate, the results of 
the Michelson-Morley experiment stand. 

In 1913, Michelson and Gale carried out their first earth-tide ex- 
periment, the purpose of which was to determine the degree of 
rigidity and of elasticity of the earth. Sir George Darwin had built 



582 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931 

up a beautiful theory of the tidal evolution of the earth-moon sys- 
tem, including the separation of the moon from the earth by fission, 
on the hypothesis that the earth as a whole is a viscous body. A 
number of us in 1909 had concluded from dynamical and geophysical 
considerations that the theory of tidal evolution is quantitatively 
errroneous. The tide experiment and the associated laborious 
mathematical work were undertaken cooperatively for the purpose 
of testing the basic hypothesis of the tidal theory. As scientists 
generally know, it was found that the earth on the whole is as stiff 
and as elastic as steel. 

The brilliancy of Michelson as an experimenter is well illustrated 
by the tide experiment. Although the radius of the earth is uncer- 
tain by several hundred feet, he measured the variations it under- 
goes as a consequence of the tidal forces of the moon and the sun 
to within one-hundredth of an inch. The final series of measure- 
ments, extending throughout all of 1917, were automatically recorded 
on motion picture film by the aid of his interferometer. 

Another adaption of the interferometer led to a means of measur- 
ing the diameters of minute satellites and planetoids and of the 
larger of the stars. It is applicable also to measuring the distances 
between the components of double stars which are so close together 
as to be completely inseparable by the most powerful telescopes. 

Although Michelson's work has had an enormous influence on 
science and will be referred to as basic for generations to come, he 
published a relatively small number of papers and books, only about 
75 in all. He never rushed into print with immature work. He was 
not in the habit of publishing the same thing over and over again in 
slightly varying form. He did not run around the country, posing 
as a genius and addressing minor scientific organizations. He never 
invited the press to carefully timed dramatic announcements before 
the major scientific societies. He never proclaimed the explosion 
of the universe. He never attracted popular attention and approval 
by claiming to find support for theological dogmas or the doctrine 
of the freedom of the will in the laws of falling bodies or in any 
other scientific principles. Instead, he pursued his modest and 
serene way along the frontiers of science, entering new pathways 
and ascending to unattained heights as leisurely and as easily as 
though he were taking an evening stroll.
